One of the benefits of having significant sums to award in grants is theopportunity to make major investments -to think big. We have been in thefortunate position of being able to dothat while maintaining our core supportfor curiosity-driven investigator-ledproposals. But rather than do 'more ofthe same' we have consciously set asidelarge sums to be spent on the trulyinnovative, large-scale projects that willhave enduring impact. This year we cansee how this policy has borne fruitmagnificently. The undoubted highlight has been the stream of papers emerging from theWellcome Trust Case ControlConsortium (page 6). Identifying genesassociated with common diseases hasbeen a goal of human geneticists fordecades, yet with a few notableexceptions progress has beenfrustratingly slow. It has taken advancesin technology, methodology andstatistical tools to arrive at a situationwhere reliable associations can now beidentified. More than 30 genes have been pinpointed by the Consortium using thisapproach, and others are likely to beconfirmed by more detailed follow-upwork. They are providing valuable leadsfor researchers investigating the biologyof these conditions, and have opened upa host of new therapeutic targets.Crucially, this work has only been madepossible by the availability of a densemap of genetic markers - an outcome ofthe Human Genome Project, thesequencing of which identified sites ofsingle-letter (so-called single partnership that mappedhundreds of thousands of SNPs acrossthe genome and made them freelyavailable for use in research. From the SNP Consortium emerged the International HapMap Project, to whichwe have also contributed support. TheHapMap Project is characterising humangenetic variation across different humanpopulations. It is variation betweenindividuals that will underpin differingsusceptibilities to disease. While SNPs still appear to be the main source of human genetic variation, copynumber variation is also turning out to besignificant (pages 6-7). Blocks of DNA maybe missing or present in different numbersof copies in different people. We are nowdiscovering that this feature is morecommon than we thought, is distinctfrom SNP variation, and impacts onhealth. In a new venture funded this year,the Case Control Consortium will besearching for copy number variation as apossible factor in common diseases.The Consortium was not the onlynotable 'big science' achievement of theyear. January 2007 saw the opening ofthe Diamond synchrotron, a joint venturewith the UK Government (page 37). Thisinitiative, the largest scientificinfrastructure project in the UK for 40years, has been many years in gestationand it gives me great pleasure to seesuch a world-class facility up and running. The value of structural approaches, where Diamond will have its biggestbiological impact, is amply illustrated bythe continuing success of the StructuralGenomics Consortium (page 37).Another public-private partnership, andbased on an international collaborationinvolving the UK, Canada and Sweden,the Structural Genomics Consortium hasconfounded sceptics - easily surpassingits targets. Protein structures, againfreely released into the public domain,have given insight into fundamentalbiological questions and are also ofdirect practical benefit, stimulating newdrug development. Large-scale high-throughput approaches are one of the strengths ofthe Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Itcontinues to play a key role in unravellingthe mysteries of the human genome - anentity that is more complex than anyonehad thought when the sequencingproject was launched (pages 6-7). TheSanger Institute has also shown how DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT 2 1Buildings housing the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. 2Structure of JMJD2A demethylase enzyme,determined by the Structural GenomicsConsortium.3Dr Mark with Stephen Fry (left) andTrust Deputy Chairman Professor MartinBobrow (right) at the opening of WellcomeCollection. 4Lung cancer cells in culture.Images12 3DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT 3 HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium finds 30 genes associated with commondiseases.

The Cancer Genome Project, a partnership between the Sanger Instituteand the Institute of Cancer Research, isanother ambitious initiative that continuesto generate important information (page 7). An early success was itsdiscovery of BRAF as a key gene involved in malignant melanoma. It nowlooks as if BRAF may be exceptional in causing such a high proportion of thesecancers. An exhaustive trawl of kinasegenes in a range of human tumours hasrevealed great diversity in the mutationspresent in cancers. Not all themutations are necessarily contributingto cancer growth, and it is a significantchallenge distinguishing the 'drivers'from the 'passengers'. Another key factor in the success of the Case Control Consortium was thenetwork of collaborating groups acrossthe UK that made it possible.Collaboration has always been centralto research but now there is even moreto be gained from pooling expertise,experience and materials. Crucially,results in one cohort could be comparedwith those obtained in others, thusconfirming that the observed ef fects are reproducible - an issue that has doggedhuman genetics for years. Collaboration has also been an important feature of our Major OverseasProgrammes. It is striking to see how ourcentres in the Far East have establishedproductive links both within their hostcountries and with others in the region -and globally (pages 20-21 and 31).Combating threats such as H5N1 aviancalls for a coherent joined-up approach - the pathogens concernedare no respecters of national borders.And by sharing results, as hashappened with steroid treatment ofmeningitis, researchers can tacklequestions that none alone couldpossibly have answered.This trend towards 'big science' is sureto continue. Progress continues on theUK Biobank project, which with data on500 000 people will provide an unrivalledresource for epidemiological research.This year we have promoted moreimaginative thinking around electronicpatient records, where the UK's nationalinfrastructure provides a hugeopportunity for hea lth research. The technical and logistical challenges aresignificant but this is an opportunity that must not be let slip away. The great advances made by large- scale initiatives should not cause us tolose sight of the high-quality researchbeing carried out by individual researchgroups. The work of Professor AdrianBird and colleagues in Edinburgh andresearchers at the Behavioural andClinical Neuroscience Institute inCambridge shows how studies ofanimal models can shed light on keybiological processes. In elegantlyconceived experiments, ProfessorBird's group has shown that the autism-like symptoms of a mouse model ofRett syndrome can be reversed throughuse of agents affecting the methylationstate of DNA. The Cambridge groupdiscovered that unusual patterns ofdopamine receptor activity in the brainwere associated with both impulsivebehaviour and susceptibility to cocaineaddiction in rats. Discussion of this year's highlights would not be complete without mentionof the opening of Wellcome Collection,our new public venue at 183 EustonRoad, London. It has proved a hugesuccess, in terms of both criticalacclaim and visitor numbers. Its uniquemix of science and art, old and new,clearly illustrates the connectionsbetween science, medicine and widerculture. It, too, demonstrates that animaginative idea, conceived anddelivered on a grand scale, can deliverrich rewards. Dr Mark Walport Director January 2008 4ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE Supporting research to increase understanding of health and disease, and its societal context.ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 6 The past couple of decades have seen enormous efforts made toidentify genes increasing oursusceptibility to common diseases.Whole-genome scans now enablethe entire genome to be screenedfor by -statistical associations discoveredin one population but not apparentin another. Now, though, anapproach spearheaded by theWellcome Trust Case ControlConsortium is finally generatingrobust data. The Consortium is making use of the dense map of genetic markersproduced by the SNP Consortium andits follow-up, the International HapMapProject. Advances in technology haveenabled high-throughput analysis ofhundreds of thousands of such markersin large numbers of individuals. The Consortium also depended on coordination among the UK's leadingresearchers (and groups abroad).Crucially, genetic associations identifiedin one population could be tested inother, increasing confidence that anassociation is real.In essence, case-control approacheslook for genetic variations that are morecommon in people with a given conditionthan in matched healthy individuals.The Consortium used the approach ona variety of conditions. This work, andfollow-up by individual disease groupsand collaborators, has now identifiedmore than 30 genetic factors contributingto diseases including heart disease,type 1 and type 2 diabetes, Crohn'sdisease, rheumatoid arthritis andankylosing spondylitis. The number ofgenes continues to increase with more detailed data analysis and follow-up. Interestingly, the approach also led tothe identification of genes associatedwith other characteristics, such asweight and height. Because so many factors affect common diseases, and a single genewill generally have only a small effect,the identification of susceptibility geneswill have limited value in the predictionof disease in individuals. Far moreimportant is the insight provided intomechanisms of disease, opening upnew avenues of research into causesand possible treatments. Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium.

When the first draft of the human genome was completed, Sir JohnSulston argued that it was abeginning not an end. The wave ofunexpected discoveries that havefollowed have vindicated that view.And it is fitting that the WellcomeTrust Sanger Institute has been atthe forefront of efforts to understandthe genome - as illustrated by itswork on conserved regions and copynumber variation. The ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) project is an internationalcollaboration analysing in detail 1 percent of the human genome. This analysishas thrown up a whole host of surprisingfindings - from the unexpectedly largeproportion of the genome copied intoRNA to the seemingly almost randomdistribution of gene control regions. The ENCODE project, to which SangerInstitute researchers Dr ManolisDermitzakis and Dr Tim Hubbard madekey contributions, is challenging receivedwisdom about how genes and genomesare organised - highlighting how muchis still to be learned about genomefunction and evolution. Last year, Dr Matt Hurles and colleagues discovered surprisingly high levels ofcopy number variation - blocks of DNAA CASE FOR CELEBRATION The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium has identified genes involved in a host of common diseases.RETHINKING THE GENOME The more the human genome is studied, the more surprises emerge. 12 1Human variation: differencesinfluence oursusceptibility DNA stained blue.4 Prostate cancer cells.ImagesADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 7 present in different numbers, or missing entirely, in different people. Furtheranalysis by Dr Dermitzakis, Dr Hurlesand colleagues has revealed that copynumber variation does not necessarilycorrelate with another source of humangenetic variation, single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs). Hence SNP-based searches for disease-linkedvariants may miss out on predispositionscaused by changes in copy number. And research continues to identify conditions influenced by copy numbervariation. In one of the few studies todate of its clinical consquences,Professor Tim Aitman and colleaguesdiscovered a link between copynumber variation affecting the FCGR3B gene and susceptibility to autoimmunediseases - but only those affecting thewhole body rather than specific organs.

ENCODE is funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute. All cancers occur due to abnormalities in DNA sequence. The steady accumulation of theseabnormalities throughout lifeultimately means that one in threepeople in the Western worlddevelops cancer. This year, theCancer Genome Project - aninternational collaboration led byProfessor Michael Stratton andcolleagues at the Wellcome TrustSanger Institute - has dramaticallyexpanded the database of knowncancer genes, adding significantly toour understanding of cancer biologyand fuelling research into thedevelopment of new treatments. The project set about probing the genetic make-up of cells taken from210 different human cancers. Thestudy focused on the genes encodingall 518 known human protein kinases,enzymes that regulate other proteinsthrough the addition of a phosphateresidue. These key molecular playerscan have a strong influence on cellgrowth and division and if not workingproperly can trigger tumourdevelopment. The molecular scrutiny revealed over 1000 different mutations. However, thepresence of a mutation does notnecessarily mean that it is contributingto uncontrolled cell growth. Indeed,most changes appear to be'passenger' mutations incidental totumour development. But theresearchers highlighted 158 mutationsin 120 kinase genes as possible'drivers' of disease. Although it adds considerably to the 350 genes previously implicated incancer, the study highlights howgenetically complex even a singletumour is. And as each tumour typeturned out to have a wide range ofdriver mutations, no obvious drugtargets emerged for particular cancers.Nevertheless, the study has opened upa whole host of new molecularpathways to investigate and drugtargets to explore.

DRIVING MISREGULATION Mining the human genome reveals far more 'cancer genes' than expected. 3 42ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 8 Rett syndrome is an autism-like disorder caused by the mutation of asingle gene - MECP2. Although the function of nerve cells is clearlyaffected, they do not die as inneurodegenerative conditions suchas Alzheimer's. A key question, then,is: can developmentalabnormalities be reversed? Workingwith a mouse model, ProfessorAdrian Bird and colleagues at theUniversity of Edinburgh haveuncovered remarkable evidence that they can. Professor Bird's team has been studying the MECP2 gene for several years. It encodes a protein thatregulates the activity of other genes.Mutations in the gene affect around 1 in 10 000 girls, and also causesdistressing physical symptoms,including loss of movement, abnormalbreathing patterns and difficulty withspeech. Many children display anabnormal, stiff-legged gait and somebecome confined to a wheelchair. Professor Bird's team created a mouse model of this disease by silencing theexpression of MECP2. To their surprise,the Rett-like symptoms these micedeveloped disappeared when the genewas reactivated. This implies that the effects of the Rettsyndrome mutation are not permanentlywired into the brain. If this is also true inpeople, it might be possible to reversethe symptoms of Rett syndrome byreactivating the MECP2 gene (although the approach used in mice is not oneapplicable to people). More generally, the study raises hopes that a range of humanneurodevelopmental disorders mightbe reversible. Guy J et al. Reversal of neurological defects in a mouse model of Rett syndrome. Science2007;315(5815):1143-7. Pain is an important protective mechanism, but there are manyoccasions when we would prefer notto experience it. Chronic pain, inparticular, can make a life a miseryand is difficult to control. Studies offamilies with a total lack of painsensation, led by Dr Geoffrey Woodsof the University of Cambridge, haveidentified a key mechanism in paindetection and may offer a new routeto effective pain relief. Six children from three related families from northern Pakistan came to theattention of researchers because oftheir extraordinary abilities to toleratenormally painful experiences.Superficially, there was nothing wrongwith their peripheral and centralnervous systems and they seemed ingood health in spite of a catalogue ofcuts, bruises and breaks they hadendured throughout childhood. By studying the affected family network, the researchers were able tohome in on the genetic basis for thiscondition. The disorder was associatedwith a region of chromosome 2containing SCN9A, a gene that encodes a voltage-gated sodiumchannel found on pain-responsiveneurons. Sequence analysis of thisRETT REVERSAL Studies in mice suggest that autism-likeconditions may be reversible.PAIN-FREE LIVING A rare defect in pain perception points the way to new analgesics. 13 1A laboratory mouse: mice are helping to reveal the mysteries of Rett syndrome. 2A network of neurons in the brain: miswiringmay cause conditions such as Rettsyndrome.3Visualising pain: an DeborahPadfield. 4A mayinfluence the desirability of food.Images1ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 9 gene in the affected individuals revealed three distinct mutations. In vitro experiments demonstrated that thesemutations shut down these sodiumchannels completely. This raises the possibility that variation in SCN9A might account for differences in pain tolerance between individuals.Furthermore, since the individuals withloss-of-function mutations in this geneare otherwise healthy, a drug that couldselectively target this sodium channelhas the potential to produce pain reliefwithout affecting other aspects ofnervous system function. Cox JJ et al. An SCN9A channelopathy causes congenital inability to experience pain. Nature2006;444(7121):894-8.What controls how much we eat? The regulation of food intake is complex,but it has become clear that a specificbrain area, the hypothalamus, plays akey role in integrating hormonalsignals from body tissues. But as Dr Sadaf Farooqi, Dr Paul Fletcherand colleagues have discovered,other brain areas are also influencedby hormones. The hormone leptin is known to be a powerful regulator of feeding - withoutit, mice (and people) eat voraciously andbecome morbidly obese. Leptin isproduced by fat cells, and is a signal forstarvation, as falling levels trigger anincrease in food intake. Leptin acts directly on the hypothalamus but, as the researchers discovered, thisis not its only target in the brain. Instudies of brain activity in two individualslacking leptin, before and after leptintherapy, leptin enhanced the responseto 'fullness' signals after food, but alsohad an effect in the brain's reward areas- the pathways associated withpleasurable sensations. Crucially, in the leptin-deficient state the patients recorded higher activity inreward pathways when shown picturesof food, and they rated them as more desirable. Thus leptin not onlyenhances 'fullness' signals in thehypothalamus but also influences thedesirability of food. Exactly how leptin acts on brain cells is unclear, but work from ProfessorDominic Withers, Professor MikeAshford and others provides clues tothe cellular systems that might respondto leptin and nutrients in the regulationof food intake and energy balance. The enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is thought to be a sensor', the body's fuel gauge.Research on two knockout mousestrains lacking AMPK in either of twokey cell populations in the hypothalamussuggests a more complicated picture.One strain became obese, but the otherremained lean. Both strains remainedsensitive to leptin, but showed abnormalglucose sensing by neurons. Therefore,while AMPK is an important sensor ofsome types of nutrients, it does notappear to be the master regulator ofenergy homeostasis in the hypothalamus. Farooqi IS et al. Leptin regulates striatal regions and human eating behavior. Science2007;317(5843):1355. Claret M et al. AMPK is essential for energy homeostasis regulation and glucose sensing byPOMC and AgRP neurons. J Clin Invest2007;117(8):2325-36. APPETITE FOR DECONSTRUCTION How does the brain integrate the factors that control our appetite? 4 5ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 10 While a complete genome sequence often reveals much about anorganism, more can be learned fromcomparisons with close relatives.They can pinpoint genetic featureslinked to pathogenic properties andshed light on evolution, as illustratedby work from Professor JulianParkhill and colleagues at theWellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Yersinia enterocolitica is a gut-dwelling mild microbial pathogen. Its relatives Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis are much nastier, causing gastroenteritisand bubonic plague respectively. Athree-way comparison of their genomeshas revealed genes associated with lifein the gut (unlike its relatives, Y. pestis lives in the bloodstream) and withdifferent clinical symptoms. Interestingly, Y. pseudotuberculosis lacks clusters of metabolic genes present in Y. enterocolitica , suggesting that they occupy distinct niches within the gut. Y. pestis is thought to have evolved very recently, and is in the process of sheddinggenes not needed in its new habitat. Asa result, it is becoming more deadly. Clostridium botulinum produces the world's most lethal toxin (2 kg could kill everyone on the planet). Although it caninfect the body, it is primarily anenvironmental organism, and itsgenomic characteristics are quitedistinct from relatives such as C. difficile. It has a very stable genome,unlike C. difficile, which seems to have hoovered up DNA from many bacteria.Rather than constantly adapting to aliving host, it relies on opportunism - a sudden lethal strike followed byleisurely digestion. Different strains of C. botulinum are only tenuously related. Indeed, the concept of a bacterial species isincreasingly hard to nail down. Somebacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, seem to have a'supragenome' - a large pool of genesonly a subset of which are found in anyone strain. Thomson NR et al.

Hiller NL malariaparasite, was sequenced in 2002.But the laboratory strain sequencedis likely to differ from those presentin the wild. Moreover, as withhumans, it will be crucial to unpickthe impact of genetic variation innatural populations. A first steptowards this goal has been taken byDr Matt Berriman and colleagues atthe Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.In a second project they have usedcomparisons of related species toinvestigate another importantparasite, Leishmania . The malaria project compiled newsequences for a parasite obtaineddirectly from a patient in Ghana, alaboratory isolate and the chimpanzeeparasite P . reichenowi . These were compared with the fully sequenced P . falciparum reference genome. In this and two other studies publishedsimultaneously, some 27 000 sites ofvariation were identified in the genome.Analysis of these sites sheds light ongenes involved in the parasite's armsrace with the host. Parasite moleculesthat are exposed to our immune systemneed to change rapidly for the parasiteto avoid detection.

The Leishmania project compared new sequences for L. infantum and L. braziliensis with the published genome of L. major. These parasites cause different forms of disease, so thegenome comparisons reveal geneticfeatures that may be linked to particularclinical symptoms. The genomes turn out to have remarkably similar structures - onlyabout 200 genes really differ in theirpresence or absence between thethree genomes. The main geneticchanges seem to arise from gene lossor inactivation. Changes in a smallnumber of genes may therefore behaving a big impact on the nature ofdisease, though other effects - such asdifferences in gene activity or genecopy number - could also besignificant.

Comparative genomic analysis of three Leishmania species that cause diversehuman disease.

Theirresilience to host immune responsesstems from their extraordinarilyvariable surface coat - as soon asthe immune system has geared upto attack one form, another typeappears and proliferates, leading towave after wave of infection. Thesequencing of the trypanosomegenome suggested unexpectedways in which the parasite might be generating this div ersity, and research from Professor Dave Barryand colleagues at the WellcomeTrust Centre for MolecularParasitology in Glasgow hasrevealed new insights into thesedeadly masters of disguise. A key finding from the trypanosome genome project was the discovery ofmany hundreds of damaged genescoding for the main trypanosomesurface protein. Professor Barry andcolleagues have found that thesedamaged genes are used as a sourceof spare parts for functional genes.Small sections are included in activegenes, altering the structure of theprotein displayed on the cell surface.This enormous capacity to create mosaicgenes theoretically enables the parasiteto create far more surface forms thanpreviously thought. New mosaic formscan appear within a few weeks ofinfection, and they may even enable theparasite to reinfect people who havedeveloped immunity to existing strains. Other work from the Glasgow group has identified an unusual method of DNArepair, which could contribute to theDNA-shuffling process creating mosaicgenes. And a mathematical studysuggests that it is the parasite itself,rather than pressures from the immunesystem, that generates waves ofinfection in a host. The parasite hasthus evolved mechanisms to prolonginfections, through a series of mini-infections, rather than immediatelyoverwhelming a host - therebyincreasing its chances of transmission.

Their trick is to create a multitude of mosaic genes. 2 33ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 12 A long-running debate has focused on the possible predisposition ofpeople to drug addiction. Geneticstudies are not clear-cut, andalthough particular types ofbehaviour and brain activity are seenin addiction, these could be aconsequence rather than a cause ofdrug taking. A neat experiment inrats, however, provides strongevidence that susceptibility toaddiction has a biologicalcomponent. The dopamine or 'reward' brain system is well known to be involved in addiction.It is also implicated in certain behaviours,including impulsivity, the tendency torespond prematurely without adequatereflection. Potentially, then, individualvariations affecting the dopaminesystem could predispose to addictionthrough their effects on behaviour. To test this idea, a group including Professor Trevor Robbins, Dr JeffreyDalley and Professor Barry Everitt inCambridge monitored drugconsumption in rats provided withaccess to the addictive drug cocaine.Before exposure, they measured theanimals' tendency to impulsivebehaviour and used brain-imagingtechniques to quantify levels ofparticular dopamine receptors. Theythen looked to see which factors wereassociated with high drug consumption. Since the rats had not previously been exposed to the drug, any associationswould be a potential cause rather thanconsequence of drug taking. The studies revealed that addiction correlated with both impulsivebehaviour and low availability ofdopamine receptors in key areas of thebrain. A defect in dopamine receptoractivity in the brain could therefore be a risk factor for drug consumption - inhumans as well as rats. Dalley JW et al. Nucleus accumbens D2/3 receptors predict trait impulsivity and cocainereinforcement. Science 2007;315(5816):1267-70. Non-invasive imaging techniques are revealing the brain in action, andhow brain activity maps toconscious awareness (or lack of it).And research is revealing someunnerving aspects of conscious andunconscious thought. It is already known that visual images can be registered in the brain even whenobservers are not aware of them. NowProfessor Geraint Rees and colleaguesat the Wellcome Trust Centre forNeuroimaging have shown that theprocessing of such unconsciouslyrecognised images is strongly affectedby attention. When subjects engaged in a demanding task were also presented with imagesthat were rendered invisible (by use of amasking technique), brain responses to these images changed according tothe attentional demands of the task. So the allocation of attention to a visualstimulus does not depend on itsconscious detection. As well as handling inputs - sensory perceptions of the world -consciousness also shapes our actions.But perhaps not as much as we mightthink. The frontal lobes of the brain areconsidered to be critical for initiatingvoluntary actions. ADDICTION PREDICTION A study with rats suggests that some individuals are more likely to become hooked on drugs than others.SEEING THE UNCONSCIOUS The unconscious brain may be guiding our actions more than we think. 1Visualising dopamine D2/D3 receptor density in regions of the brain. 2Cocaine: susceptibility to addiction may lie,in part, in our genes. 3Part of the frontal lobe (red) involved inautomatic suppression of reflex responses.4Decisions, decisions: does thesubconscious influence us more than wethink? 5Dutch art flourished in the 17th century,alongside commerce and science.Engraving by C de Passe after M de Vos.Images 1 24ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 13 Yet when Dr Petroc Sumner, Professor Masud Husain and colleagues studiedtwo individuals with localised lesions inkey regions of the prefrontal cortex, theyfound that automatic, unconsciousresponses that normally suppressunwanted actions were impaired as well. Similarly, Dr Hakwan Lau and Professor Richard Passingham have found thatthe prefrontal cortex can also engage insubconscious processing. In theirstudies, volunteers were subconsciouslyprimed before undertaking a taskrequiring conscious thought, the primebeing either compatible or incompatiblewith the task. Even though subjectshad no conscious knowledge of theprime, incompatible primes disruptedtheir thinking. Furthermore, brain imagingrevealed activity in the prefrontal cortexwhen an incompatible prime waspresented, implying that it is engaged insubconscious processing of information. Bahrami B et al.

Something resembling modern science first emerged in Europefour-and-a-half centuries ago. Thenew emphasis on observation andexperiment is often portrayed aspart of the wider intellectualflowering of the EuropeanRenaissance, yet that movement'sadherence to classical knowledgewas antithetical to the empiricism atthe heart of the new thinking. Now,Professor Hal Cook, Director of theWellcome Trust Centre for theHistory of Medicine at UCL, hasproposed a radical new interpretation:it was commerce that really poweredthe scientific revolution. Until now, historians have linked the birth of modern science to religion - aretreat from superstition and the rise ofProtestantism, with its more direct,humanistic interpretation of religioustexts - alongside the emergence of anatural philosophy emphasisingknowledge gained by experiment. Therise of the international tradingeconomy during the same period hasgenerally been seen as independent. In Matters of Exchange , Professor Cook argues that, far from being merely coincidental, the new global commercialculture - seen most clearly in the DutchRepublic during its golden age of1581-1695 - was the key driver of thescientific revolution. At the time, Professor Cook suggests, the factors driving Dutch expansionismwere seen as precisely thoseunderpinning the new science. Theknowledge economy of the day placeda high value on objective descriptionand accumulation of knowledge,through observation and experiment.And they went hand in hand with ascientific methodology that soughtrational explanations for observablephenomena. Indeed, Professor Cook argues, this pragmatism became firmly instilled inDutch culture and thinking. Its medicinefocused not on arcane theories ofcauses but on careful description andtreatment. The result was an explosionin science, botany, medicine, naturalhistory and the arts. At least some reviewers were convinced: \"Cook is deeply persuasive that scienceand commerce are epistemologicallylinked through materialist necessity inthis magisterial scholarly analysis,\" saidthe Journal of the American Medical Association. \"Altogether an enrichingtome,\" added the New England Journal of Medicine. GOING DUTCH Did Dutch trade kick-start the scientific revolution? 5NEW FUNDINGADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 14 Africa Centre Copybook project The brain of the beholder A \u00a316.8 million award to the Africa Centre for Health and PopulationStudies will see it continue its criticalresearch on HIV. The Africa Centre, based in KwaZulu- Natal in South Africa, is one of theleading African HIV research institutes.Led by Professor Marie-Louise Newell,it has established one of the continent'smost comprehensive demographicsurveillance systems, covering 90 000people in mainly rural locations, andhas done much to document the extentand impact of HIV and AIDS on SouthAfrican people (see page 19). The population is particularly badly affected by HIV - around one in fourpeople in the local community is HIVpositive. The infection's impact iscompounded by poverty, migration andlack of access to effective treatments. With renewed five-year core funding, the Africa Centre is well placed to focuson monitoring and evaluating the Anti-Retroviral Treatment Programme forHIV, which is currently being rolled out,and assessing the impact ofsimultaneous epidemics of HIV,sexually transmitted infections andtuberculosis. The Africa Centre alsoaims to identify the best ways to deliverHIV-related healthcare in a low-incomerural setting. Opened in 1997, the Africa Centre is a collaboration between the University ofKwaZulu-Natal, the South AfricanMedical Research Council and theWellcome Trust.A \u00a31 an innovativemultidisciplinary Professor Semir Zeki from University College London (UCL) aims to bringneuroscience into areas normally seenas the territory of artists andphilosophers. Can we measure beautyobjectively? How are beauty and loverelated? What does it mean to behappy? What is creativity? With this new funding, Professor Zeki hopes to attract students andresearchers from the sciences, arts andhumanities into taking up trulyinterdisciplinary research. Their workwill be overseen by an advisory boardthat includes author Dame AntoniaByatt, doctor, broadcaster and operadirector Sir Jonathan Miller, and theDirector of the Courtauld Institute ofArt, Dr Deborah Swallow. With Professor Ray Dolan, Director of the Wellcome Trust Centre forNeuroimaging at UCL, Professor Zekiwill bring an experimentalneurobiological approach to profoundissues that have taxed thinkers forcenturies. The results not only willincrease our knowledge about theworkings of the human brain but alsoshould offer fascinating insights intohuman nature and how we viewourselves.The Wellcome Trust Case ControlConsortium is turning its attention to copy number variation. The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium demonstrated the value of coordinated efforts to scan entiregenomes for disease susceptibilitygenes (see page 6). It focused onsimple variation - single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs) - but copynumber variation also affects health(see pages 6-7). With \u00a37.7 millionfollow-up funding from the Consortium now sweepingthe genome for disease-associatedcopy number variation. Copy number variation is much less well understood than SNPs, butunderstanding is developing rapidly. TheConsortium is using newly developedtools to carry out high-throughputanalyses of 19 000 samples from eightdiseases (the seven diseases from themain study, plus breast cancer), tosearch for changes in copy numberassociated with disease. It will also be dissecting in more detail some of the genomic regions identifiedin the first phase, which appear toinclude more than one genetic factorinfluencing health. As in phase 1, data and software tools will be made freely available to theresearch community - emphasising thevalue of not only the Consortium'sscientific discoveries but also its'pathfinder' role, developing tools andtechniques to accelerate research.ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 15 A new Wellcome Trust Centre for Gene Regulation and Expression isbeing established at the Universityof Dundee. The discovery that humans have a surprisingly small number of geneshighlighted how important control ofgene activity is in human biology. Anexquisitely complex set of interactionsensures that genes are only active inthe right cells and at the right times. The Dundee Centre, funded by a \u00a35 million Strategic Award to PrincipalResearch Fellow Professor AngusLamond and colleagues, will build onthe expertise of a number of groupsworking on different aspects of genecontrol, including transcription, splicingand chromosome dynamics. It aims to pioneer a new approach in cell biology by bringing togetheradvanced imaging and proteomicstechnologies, combined with enhanceddata analysis tools, to provide aquantitative understanding of generegulation and chromosome biology atthe single-cell level.

Workfrom the group of Professor TonyGreen, at the University ofCambridge, is now revealing themolecular defects underlying thesedisorders, and laying the foundationfor more rational diagnosis andtreatment. All the various types of blood cell originate from blood stem cells.Mutations affecting blood stem cellsare thought to result in a number ofblood disorders, including the MPD. However, the origins of the MPDs (polycythaemia vera, essentialthrombocythaemia and idiopathicmyelofibrosis) includingProfessor Green's, reported mutationsin a gene called JAK2. Surprisingly a single JAK2 mutation was found in the majority of people with polycythaemiavera and in around half of those withessential thrombocythaemia oridiopathic myelofibrosis. By analysingpatient samples from a large Green's group was alsoable to identify previously unrecogniseddisease variants and produce a new molecular classification of the MPDs.Gradually, other genetic causes are being unpicked. In 2007, for example, Professor Green's group found a newset of JAK2 mutations and identified a novel variant of polycythaemia vera. Together, these findings have made a dramatic impact on clinicalmanagement. A widely used moleculartest is already allowing simple andmore accurate diagnosis. Theidentification of molecular lesions notonly provides a more logical basis forgrouping patients, but also providestargets for novel therapies. SeveralJAK2 inhibitors are being developed and the results of initial clinical studiesare eagerly awaited. Baxter EJ et al.

Thisnumber could be dramatically slashedif more children slept beneathinsecticide-treated bednets. Take-uphas been limited, however. Now,Professor Bob Snow and colleaguesat the Kenya Medical ResearchInstitute-Wellcome Trust ResearchProgramme in Kenya have shownthat free supply of bednets canmake a huge impact on coverage -particularly among the poor. Although the benefits of treated bednets are well-established, how bestto encourage their use is less clear. Aswell as the cost implications, there havebeen concerns that free bednets willnot be valued or used. A commoncompromise is for bednets to be madeby local suppliers and sold at asubsidised price. But even low-cost bednets may be out of reach of many. Dr Abdisalan Noor (aWellcome Trust Research TrainingFellow) and Professor Snow thereforeset out to examine how coverage wasaffected by cost in Kenya. In 2004, netswere available only through thecommercial sector. By 2005, a campaignwas making subsidised nets available. BLOOD TIES A better understanding of blood disorders is leading to improved diagnosis and targeted therapies.NET BENEFITS Making bednets available for free has greatly increased their use in Kenya. 1 1Cross-section of a small blood vessel containingred blood cells and awhite blood cell.2Bednets: freedistribution 3A meal ofblood.4Mothers breastfeedingyoung infants in sub-Saharan Africa.Images3USING KNOWLEDGE 19 And in 2006, a mass free distribution programme began. In 2004, bednet use was just 7 per cent. By 2005, this had risen to 24 per cent.But in 2006, it had leapt to 66 per cent.And while bednet use in 2004 wasdominated by richer families, almost nodifference between socioeconomicgroups was seen in 2006. Another study has stressed the benefits of providing bednets to older childrenand adults too. Using the latest modelsof mosquito behaviour and mortality,Research Career Development FellowDr Gerry Killeen and colleagues arguethat this would kill adult mosquitoesdirectly or force them to undertakelonger, more hazardous foragingexpeditions in search of their next feed.

PLoS Med2007;4(7):e229.In developing countries, where most babies depend on breast milk fortheir survival, HIV transmission frommother to child during breastfeedingis common. Intriguingly, however,researchers at the Africa Centre forHealth and Population Studies inSouth Africa have found that HIVtransmission is far lower if mothersfeed their children exclusively withbreast milk for the first six monthsthan if they also introduce formulamilk or solids at this early stage. In a study of more than 2000 new mothers in rural and urban areas,Professor Hoosen Coovadia andcolleagues found that there was a 4 percent risk of postnatal HIV transmissionbetween the ages of six weeks and sixmonths to babies fed on breast milkalone. Infants who received a mixture ofbreast milk and formula were nearlytwice as likely to be infected as thosereceiving breast milk only. Alarmingly,those given both breast milk and solidswere almost 11 times likelier than thebreast-only group to acquire infection. This unexpected benefit of breast milk may come about because itstrengthens the baby's gut lining. Thelarger, more complex proteins found informula, animal milk and solids, bycontrast, may damage the intestine,allowing HIV to pass into thebloodstream more effectively. UNICEF, the World Health Organization and UNAIDS have already revised theirguidelines on infant feeding to reflectthese findings. This could dramaticallyreduce the vertical transmission of HIVfrom mother to child on the Africancontinent and beyond. Coovadia HM et al. Mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 infection during exclusive breastfeedingin the first 6 months of life: an intervention cohortstudy. Lancet 2007;369(9567):1107-16.BREAST IS DEFINITELY BEST Exclusive breastfeeding could significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission in Africa. 3 412USING KNOWLEDGE 20 The Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 killed millions. Doctors had notreatments to offer, but among theremedies tried was blood transfusionfrom survivors to patients. This maywell have reduced mortality - andresearchers at the Hospital forTropical Diseases and the WellcomeTrust's South-east Asia Programmein Vietnam have found that anupdated approach might offerprotection from H5N1 avian flu. H5N1 kills a high proportion of people it infects. But some survive, and in theirbloodstream are antibodies that mayprevent the virus infecting cells. To testthis idea, Dr Tran Tinh Hien, DrCameron Simmons, Professor colleagues in samples from H5N1 survivorsand, collaboration with antibody celllines making anti-H5N1 antibody. A well as binding tightly to H5N1 in biochemical assays, some of thesemonoclonal antibodies were able toprotect mice from infection and keptmice alive after exposure to a lethaldose of virus. Antibodies protected wellagainst the strain of H5N1 people hadbeen exposed to, but also offeredprotection against other H5N1 strains.A set of monoclonal antibodies ofvarying specificity might therefore offeran additional weapon against avian flu.Or, in an emergency, transfusions fromflu survivors might enhance survival, asin the Spanish flu pandemic. The Vietnam group is also studying the body's response to H5N1, to find out why the virus is so deadly.Animal studies have suggested thatsevere disease is linked to rapid virus multiplication (high viral load) and excessive release of cytokines,molecules that signal between immune cells. A comparison of patientswith H5N1 and human flu conductedby Dr Menno de Jong, Dr Simmonsand Dr Hien confirmed that humanH5N1 infection is associated with very high viral loads and a massive cytokine response. This suggests that early prevention of viral multiplication, and possiblymanagement of the cytokine response,should be priorities in treatment of H5N1. Simmons CP et al. Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of human monoclonal antibodies againstH5N1 influenza. PLoS Med 2007;4(5):e178. de Jong MD et al.

A resurgence of dengue intropical regions is reawakeninginterest in the disease. In Vietnam,researchers are dissecting the clinicalsyndrome and the body's responseto the virus to identify possible linksto severe disease. They are also partof international collaborationstackling this growing menace. Over the past 30 years, dengue has emerged as a major threat to healthin tropical regions. It affects around 100million people a year, with severalhundred thousand experiencing themore severe form of dengue. Several distinct strains of dengue virus exist, but the immune response to thevirus is complex and poorlyunderstood. In infants, for example, DrCameron Simmons and colleagues atthe Wellcome Trust's South-east AsiaProgramme in Vietnam have found thatlow levels of maternal antibodiescorrelate reasonably (but notabsolutely) with disease severity but,surprisingly, the link between viral loadand disease is weak at best. Theseresults could have significantimplications for vaccine development.KILL OR CURE Survivors of H5N1 infection may hold the secret to others' survival.FEVERISH ACTIVITY Dengue is beginning to receive the attention it deserves. 1Influenza virus particles on cells lining theairways of the lung.2Hn, 11-year-old 5Public water supply inBangladesh.Images45USING KNOWLEDGE 21 Similarly, collaborative studies with Dr Kerstin Luhn and others in Oxford havefound unusual patterns of regulatory Tcell activity in dengue. As in avian flu(see left), disease seems to be triggeredby excessive cytokine release. Onepossibility is that this over-reactionarises from defective regulatory T cellactivity. Yet regulatory T cells turned outto be present and active in dengue -but seemed to be overwhelmed by thestrength of the response triggered bythe virus. Emphasis is also being placed on coordinated global responses. ProfessorJeremy Farrar is playing an active role inDENCO, a global dengue clinicalresearch network, supported by theEuropean Commission and theWellcome Trust, which brings togetherclinical aspects with basic science,epidemiology and public health,spanning countries in South-east Asia,South America and Europe, and withclose links to the World HealthOrganization.

A new vaccine developed withWellcome Trust Technology Transfer funding has recentlycompleted a phase II clinical trial,involving children aged between fiveand 14 in Vietnam. Encouragingly,the vaccine was both safe andelicited good immune responses inthe vaccinated children. The vaccine has been developed by Emergent Biosolutions Inc., a US-based vaccine and therapeuticcompany. It is a single-dose drinkablevaccine based on a live attenuatedstrain of Salmonella typhi , the bacterium that causes typhoid fever.The strain has two genes deleted,which abolishes its ability to causedisease. Early development of thevaccine was carried out by Reading-based company Microscience, which later became part of Emergent Biosolutions. The latest trial was carried out in Vietnam, with support from ProfessorJeremy Farrar and colleagues at theWellcome Trust's Major OverseasProgramme. In a double-blindrandomised control trial, 101 childrenreceived vaccine and 50 placebo.There were no serious adverse eventsin the treated group, who showedsignificantly higher antibody responsesto bacterial antigens. Previous trials inthe UK, USA and in adults in Vietnamhave also shown that the vaccine issafe and immunogenic. Although a phase II trial does not necessarily mean that the vaccine willprotect against infection, the better-than-expected results boostconfidence that the vaccine will beeffective in the field and pave the wayfor larger phase III trials. TYPHOID TRIAL A vaccine for typhoid fever has completed a phase II trial. 312 USING KNOWLEDGE 22 Among the instruments on board the Beagle 2 spacecraft was a prototypeminiaturised mass spectrometer, thedevelopment of which was sponsoredby the Wellcome Trust. The newtechnology, it was thought, wouldalso filter through to other labequipment. Indeed, it now has apotentially life-saving terrestrialapplication - as a new tool todiagnose TB. Mass spectrometry is a popular laboratory technique for analysingchemical structures. Mass specequipment, though, is large and bulky -wholly impractical for a space mission.With Trust support, Professor ColinPillinger and Dr Geraint 'Taff' Morgan atthe Open University set aboutminiaturising the technology so that itwas suitable for interplanetary travel. While the equipment never got to search for Martian microbes, the OpenUniversity team has adapted thetechnology to identify chemicalproducts characteristic ofMycobacterium tuberculosis , the cause of TB. Now, with \u00a31.34 millionTechnology Transfer funding, they haveteamed up with Wellcome Trust SeniorClinical Fellow in Tropical Medicine Dr Liz Corbett, at the London School ofHygiene and Tropical Medicine, todevelop and evaluate the technology in a resource-poor setting. TB kills around two million people every year, mainly in developing countries.Globally, one person in three is thoughtto be infected with M. tuberculosis. But widely used methods for detectinginfection, based on culture of sputumsamples, are neither quick norparticularly reliable. Speed is a crucialfactor. Conventional methods ofdiagnosis take weeks - by which timepatients with TB may be gravely ill, ifnot dead, particularly if they are alsoinfected with HIV. The new device will provide results within hours, so treatment can beginimmediately. It will detect the presenceof a complex lipid specific for M. tuberculosis; integrated software,being developed by the BioinformaticsGroup at Cranfield University, willanalyse results and determine diseasestatus. When the device has beenshown to work under laboratoryconditions, it will be trialled inZimbabwe, TB is rife.MRSA Clostridium difficile are major headaches for the UK publichealth system, and bacteria areemerging that tolerate the feweffective antibiotics still available.New approaches are urgentlyneeded, and the engineeredlantibiotics being developed byNovacta Biosystems with WellcomeTrust Technology Transfer fundingmay provide agents that not only killbacteria but also are less vulnerableto resistance. Lantibiotics (lanthionine-containing are and killother Gram-positive bacteria. They acton lipid II, a precursor needed forbacterial cell wall biosynthesis.Resistance is less likely to arisebecause lipid II consists of severalcomponents, and depends on thecoordinated activity of several genes. The Gram-positive bacterium C. difficile causes serious gastrointestinal symptoms that are potentially deadly inweak and elderly people. Although itremains sensitive to drugs such asvancomycin, infections return in up to aquarter of cases, through eitherreinfection or incomplete eradication.

One reason why reinfection is so common is that vancomycin is a non-specific antibiotic that eliminates wholeswathes of gut bacteria, includingharmless bystanders. The gut is thusfree territory for recolonisation. Lantibiotics, by contrast, are potentially more specific. Moreover, because theyare peptides made by a commonlyused strain of bacteria, it is possible toengineer new peptides using genetictechniques. Through this approach,Novacta, a spin-off from the John InnesCentre in Norwich, has produced aseries of lead compounds highlyspecific for C. difficile and with good pharmacological properties both incells and in animals. With initial Technology Transfer funding, Novacta has analysed several hundredcompounds and assessed their effectson different strains of C. difficile and in different infected animals. The successof this research has led to \u00a33.5 millionfollow-on funding to develop leadcompounds by testing for safety andtoxicity, with the eventual aim of testinga selected lead compound in a phase Iclinical trial. The 'i-Snake' surgical robot will takekeyhole surgery into previouslyunexplored territory. Keyhole surgery was one of the great medical advances of the 20th century.Sophisticated surgical operations couldbe carried out with comparatively littletrauma, and patients could rapidlyreturn to normal life. But there are limits to the procedures that can be carried out this way. The 'i-Snake', the brainchild of ProfessorLord Darzi and Professor Guang-ZhongYang of Imperial College London, will bedesigned to take keyhole surgery intopreviously inaccessible new territories.With \u00a32.1 million of Technology Transferfunding, the multidisciplinary team isdrawing inspiration from the world ofherpetology, by developing a flexiblyjointed robot that will navigate its waythrough body spaces to hard-to-reachlocations.

It provides stimulatinginsight into the human condition,combining cultural, scientific andartistic frames of reference. \"A new museum that is unashamedly 'braining up',\" applauded NigelRichardson in the Daily Telegraph . \"You will spill back on to the Euston exhilarated and called ofthe most thought-provoking exhibitionsI've been to in years.\" Even the Sun,not usually known for its coverage ofeither art or science, devoted a double-page spread to its delights. The nine-storey building houses three galleries. The largest of these, on theground floor, hosts temporary themedexhibitions, opening with The Heart(see right). The other two galleries house two permanent exhibitions. Medicine Man, previously shown at the BritishMuseum, contains more than 500artefacts from Sir Henry Wellcome'soriginal collection, including a lock ofGeorge III's hair and Napoleon'stoothbrush. And Medicine Nowexplores contemporary medical topicssuch as obesity and genomes throughthe eyes of scientists, artists andpopular culture. The exhibitions are supplemented by a lively programme of public events,where audiences can explore anddebate current issues and ancientmysteries of human wellbeing. All the visitor attractions have been positively received. Even the Peytonand Byrne caf\u00e9 gained rave reviews:\"This Jenni Muir in Time Out.The Heart - the opening temporary exhibition in the new \u00a330 millionWellcome Collection - explored themedical and cultural significance ofthe heart, through attractions asdiverse as drawings of an ox heartby Leonardo da Vinci, prints by AndyWarhol and (for the non-squeamish)live heart surgery.

The multifaceted view of the heart was carried through to a successfulsymposium, 'Matters of the Heart', anda book edited by James Peto, TheHeart, published by Yale UniversityPress. \"In an age when research isincreasingly sophisticated, and oftenseemingly inaccessible,\" said theLancet in its review, \"an intelligent impression of the cultural and socialimplications of these marvellousachievements is uplifting and mostuniquely welcome.\" More than 200 schools - 85 per centfrom the state sector - and 2000students have participated in theDebating Matters competition since2004, when the Wellcome Trustprovided funding to the Institute ofIdeas through an Engaging ScienceSociety Award. More than a third ofthe schools had never previouslybeen involved with debate. The Institute of Ideas and Pfizer Debating Matters competition waspiloted in 2003 and is now wellestablished as the country's leadingschools debating competition. Sixth-form students in eight UK regionsdebate issues that impact on the world,and the way in which we understandand shape it. Many of these issueshave a scientific strand to them. In their preparation, students are expressly asked to find the evidencethey need to support their case. Duringthe competition, judges from a range ofprofessional backgrounds posequestions and prompt students todevelop and defend their arguments.At the end, they offer critical butconstructive feedback. The focus is on the quality of the arguments and response to questionsfrom the judges, the opposing teamand the audience. Students need notonly to make a convincing case, butalso to think on their feet. Time andtime again, students have shown thatthey can rise to the challenge. The National Final 2006/07 took place at King's College London and theNational Portrait Gallery, with MarkWalport, Director of the WellcomeTrust, as one of the judges. QueenElizabeth's Sixth Form College from theNorth East won the first prize, after aclose-fought round on human genetics,with Elfed High School from northWales as runners-up. Students taking part have been enthusiastic.

As well as this practical support, the Centre also fed into education policymaking, with its Director, ProfessorJohn Holman, being appointed the UKGovernment's National STEM Directorin October 2006, with a remit tocoordinate the UK's science,technology, engineering andmathematics (STEM) activities acrossschools and other centres of learning. The National Science Learning Centre opened in 2005, part of a \u00a351 millionpartnership with the Department forChildren, Schools and Families toprovide high-quality continuingprofessional development opportunitiesfor science teachers and technicians. As well as more training days, the Centre also added 44 new courses,and now offers 76 in total. These rangefrom a summer school for newlyqualified teachers through to'Leadership for Impact: New andaspiring heads of science', which willform one third of a new MA in ScienceEducation and Leadership beingoffered by the University of York. A Network Projects Director was appointed in December 2006 tocoordinate activities across the tenScience Learning Centres. TheNational Centre also began developinga bid, with the regional Centres, tocreate a united network of ScienceLearning Centres across England. The Centre has also worked closely with other key bodies in education,such as the Qualifications andCurriculum Authority, with which theCentre ran a series of workshops oncurriculum development, and theTraining and Development Agency for Schools. Professor Holman's appointment as National STEM Director will help toensure that Science Learning Centresare integral to initiatives promotingSTEM education. The STEM programmeis underpinned by the STEM High LevelStrategy Group, which offers advice toministers on national priorities andincludes a representative from theWellcome Trust.The Relief of Belsen, a feature-lengthdrama-documentary telling one ofthe most extraordinary stories toemerge from World War II, premieredon 15 October 2007 on Channel 4. On 17 April 1945, a British ambulance unit accompanying the drive to Berlinwas ordered instead to a newlyliberated prison camp in northernGermany to handle an outbreak oftyphus. That camp was Bergen-Belsen. The arriving British unit found 40 000 prisoners starving and living in squalor,including, in one hut designed for 100,1346 people - not counting the dead. Over the next few weeks, an international team of doctors, nurses,former inmates, soldiers and localGermans, led by the medical corps ofthe British Army, worked to try to savethe dying prisoners of Belsen, while thewar continued to rage throughoutEurope. In the process, they createdthe biggest hospital in Europe. The Relief of Belsen tells this story, using scripted drama, testimony and extensive news footage from the 'horrorcamp'. It received a Wellcome TrustPublic Engagement Award in theHistory of Medicine to ensure itsmedical and historical authenticity. ACTION AND INFLUENCE New courses, a move into new areas and an expanded remit marked a successful year for the National Science Learning Centre.

Satellite units exist in thesecountries, with collaborations inseveral nearby countries, including along-standing partnership with Laos. Sandwiched between Vietnam and Thailand, Laos is a predominantly ruralcountry of around 6.5 million people.Since 1999, the Thai unit has beencollaborating with researchers atMahosot Hospital, Vientiane. Theresearch, which is led by clinicians Dr Paul Newton, Dr Mayfong Mayxay (a former Wellcome Trust fellow) and Dr Rattanaphone Phetsouvanh inVientiane, concentrates on infectiousdiseases, to support evidence-basedclinical practice and health policy. Malaria has been a key priority. An analysis of malarial parasites, and cure rates in malaria patients, has revealed high levels of resistance to chloroquine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. This, and otherevidence, has led to the government ofLaos changing treatment policy toartemisinin-based combination therapy. Bacterial infections have also been an important focus. As in much of Asia,the causes of fever in Laos are poorlyunderstood. Studies have uncovered asurprisingly high incidence of typhoidfever, identified Staphylococcus aureusas the main cause of septicaemia in theunder-ones, and revealed unexpectedlyhigh incidences of scrub typhus,murine typhus and leptospirosis. Suchinformation is important as it hasguided changes in the use of suitableantibiotics. Although Laos does not yethave a serious problem with drug-resistant bacteria, nearby countries doand there is a risk that such strains willbe introduced or arise de novo. But research extends beyond infectious diseases: the Laos teamrecently came across cases of fatalheart damage in children who hadeaten the skin and eggs of a commontoad, Bufo melanostictus . Interviews suggested that toad poisoning may berelatively common and a significantpublic health issue. Mayxay M et al.

Dr Catherine Millar, aWellcome Trust International PrizeTravelling Fellow awarded aResearch Career DevelopmentFellowship this year, is using yeast tounderstand some of the intricaciesof gene control. Dr Millar studied for her PhD in Professor Adrian Bird's laboratory inEdinburgh, focusing on a proteinknown as MBD4. From Edinburgh, she moved to the laboratory of Professor MichaelGrunstein at the University of California,Los Angeles. Her work there shifted tothe modification of histones and theirpossible role in controlling gene activity. Dr Millar's focus has been a variant of histone H2A known as Htz1 in yeast.Although Htz1 is found mainly atinactive genes, acetylation at oneparticular point is associated with activegenes. Now in Manchester, Dr Millar isusing her Fellowship to establish agroup to probe more deeply into Htz1function. Millar CB et al. Enhanced CpG mutability and tumorigenesis in MBD4-deficient mice.

Theymust generate an immune responseto defend the body againstpathogens in the gut but must notreact to dietary antigens or thesymbiotic microbes that have madeit their home. Research led byProfessor Fiona Powrie, WellcomeTrust Senior Research Fellow at theUniversity of Oxford, is piecingtogether the complex web ofinteractions that maintain thisdelicate balance. It is becoming increasingly clear that the gut's immune mechanisms play akey role in our defence - but alsocontribute to common medicalcomplaints. Around 1 in 1000 people indeveloped countries enduresinflammatory bowel disease (IBD), wherean overactive immune system ends updamaging the body's own tissues. A possible answer to the miseries of IBD may lie with regulatory T cells:immune cells exciting great interestbecause of the ability to turn offunwanted immune responses.Professor Powrie's research hasrevealed much about how these cellsoperate, both in normal health and ininflammatory conditions such as IBD.Of particular interest has been thediscovery that, unlike most tissues, thegut does not depend only on regulatoryT cells from the thymus - it produces itsown. This production is dependent ona classical regulatory T cell stimulus,TGF-\u00df, and the vitamin A metaboliteretinoic acid. It also appears thatregulatory T cells occupy a distinctlocation in the gut tissue. Professor Powrie's group has also identified factors that may tip theintestinal balance towards over-reaction.The cytokine IL-23, for example, seemsto be specifically involved in promotinginflammatory reactions in the gut - andis thus an exciting new target for IBDtherapies.

But unlikesingle-gene disorders, geneticanalysis of complex behaviouraltraits remains challenging. The lissencephaly story begins with a large-scale mutagenic study of mice,and a search for animals with unusualbehavioural traits. One such animalshowed abnormalities in brain structureand neuron migration similar to thoseseen in other strains with lissencephaly-like features. The animal had acquired amutation in a tubulin gene, whichaffected its ability to make microtubules,components of the cell's internalskeleton. The similarity between the mouse mutants led the team to screen fortubulin mutations in people withlissencephaly of unknown cause. Twosuch individuals had mutations 1Professor Fiona a ofschistosometransmission, LakeVictoria in Uganda. 5The head of aschistosome parasite.ImagesONE, TWO, MANY A single-gene disorder has proven more tractable than a complexcondition.DEVELOPING PEOPLE 33 affecting the human version of the mouse tubulin gene. Follow-up studiesidentified tubulin mutations in six more people with a range of neuro-developmental conditions. But unlike single-gene abnormalities, genetic dissection of behavioural traitsor neuropsychiatric conditions remainsdifficult. For example, a large-scalewhole-genome scan factorsassociated with neuroticism failed toidentify genes clearly associated withthe trait, even though twin studies implythat genes are important. Possibly, manyrare interacting factors underlie suchtraits - and hence very large studies willbe needed to identify themunambiguously. Keays DA et al.

MolPsychiatry 2007 [Epub ahead of print].In Uganda, two Wellcome Trust- funded fellows - Dr Simon Brookerand Dr Alison Elliott - are aiming tofind out more about the impact ofschistosomes and their control. Control of infections calls for a good understanding of where they occur.Transmission will vary across a country,and information is rarely available forevery region. Nonetheless, bycombining field data with climate dataacquired from remote sensing systems,spatial patterns can be modelled, helping to fill gaps in survey data. Using this approach, Dr Brooker, a newly appointed Career DevelopmentFellow at the London School of Hygieneand Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), andcolleagues have developed a predictivemap of infection risk. By reducing theneed for expensive field surveys, theapproach has made national controlefforts economically feasible, and hashelped to guide control in Uganda, aspart of the Gates Foundation-financedSchistosome Control Initiative. Otherwork has evaluated the health impactand cost-effectiveness of control.On the other hand, schistosomeinfections are so common that theyfrequently overlap with other infections,such as HIV/AIDS or TB. HIV is knownto accelerate TB disease, and Dr Elliott,who holds a Career Post in ClinicalTropical Medicine at the LSHTM, hasdiscovered that schistosomes furtheraccelerate TB progression in HIV-infected individuals. Nevertheless, most helminth infections go unnoticed, as the parasite blocksthe host's immune response. And whilethis might promote other infections, orinterfere with BCG vaccination, it mayactually have benefits - protectingagainst severe malaria or allergicconditions. Dr Elliott is therefore leadinga clinical trial in Uganda examining theeffects of de-worming treatments ofpregnant mothers and children oninfection and responses to vaccination. Clements AC et al.

But is the impact of such interventions fully understood? 3 45DEVELOPING PEOPLE 34 The complement system is an important part of the body'sdefences against infection. It isbased on a complex cascade ofreactions that ultimately generates aprotein superstructure that destroysinvading cells. Given this firepower,complement must be kept undertight control. The bloodstreamprotein factor H plays a crucial rolein this control, and deficiencies in itsactivity have been linked to severaldiseases. At Imperial CollegeLondon, new Wellcome Trust SeniorResearch Fellow Dr MatthewPickering has been clarifying the roleof factor H in kidney disease. Exactly how factor H contributes to disease processes is not always clear.Using transgenic mice lacking factor H,Dr Pickering has been teasing theseprocesses apart. Complement activation has been implicated in an inflammatory kidneydisease, membranoproliferativeglomerulonephritis type 2, also knownas dense deposit disease. The diseasedevelops spontaneously in micelacking factor H. However, its severity isreduced in the absence of complementprotein C5. In addition, antibody-triggered kidney disease is preventedwhen animals lacking factor H are givenanti-C5 antibody. As well as implicatingC5 in the disease, these findingsidentify C5 as a potentially importantdrug target. Factor H has also been linked to retinal degeneration and a rare kidney diseaseof children, atypical haemolytic uraemicsyndrome (aHUS). The genetic factorsdriving seen micelacking factor H appear distinct fromthose linked to aHUS. This appears toreflect the impact of different mutationsin the factor H gene. Indeed, whentransgenic mice were created with theaHUS version of the factor H gene, theanimals developed signs of aHUS. These mice are important as they represent the first animal model ofaHUS. They pinpoint complementactivation on kidney endothelial cells asthe key site of damage and open up theprospect of testing targeted therapies. Pickering MC et al.

Among the first batch ofsuccessful applicants was Dr Thomas Jahn, whose interests liein the mechanisms driving abnormalfolding of proteins implicated inneurodegenerative disorders suchas Parkinson's and Alzheimer'sdisease. Dr Jahn studied biochemistry at the University of Halle, before beingawarded a place on the Four-year PhDProgramme at the University of Leeds.Under the supervision of ProfessorsSheena Radford and Steve Homans,he used a variety of biophysicaltechniques to study the folding of beta-2-microglobulin. This protein shows a natural tendency to aggregate into fibrils similar to thoseseen in Alzheimer's disease (amyloidfibrils), resulting in the disorder dialysis-related amyloidosis. The structuralstudies showed that beta-2-microglobulin first converts into apartially unfolded intermediate form thathas a high propensity to bind furthercopies, polymerising into a fibril.THE H FACTOR The complex role of factor H in kidney disease is gradually being unravelled.ASSEMBLING A CAREER 1Membranous glomerulonephritis. 2Dr Matthew Pickering, a new Senior ResearchFellow at London.3Dr Thomas Jahn, one ofthe asseen in Alzheimer'sdisease. 5Dairy cows.Images1 2 3How proteins aggregate is the focus of a new Sir Henry Wellcome Fellow.DEVELOPING PEOPLE 35 NEW FUNDING PRINCIPAL RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS T CELLS Professor Gillian Griffiths (University of Cambridge) Secretion mechanisms ofcytotoxic T lymphocytes.

The SGChas significantly boosted thenumbers of structures beingreleased, and is responsible foralmost one in four of all proteinstructures going into publicdatabases. And the freely releasedinformation is of value in bothfundamental research and targeteddrug development. Modification of histones has emerged as an important mechanism controllinggene activity. Accordingly, muchattention has been focused on theenzymes that add or remove thesemodifications. Of particular importanceis how the exquisite specificity of theseenzymes is achieved. A structural study of the JMJD2A demethylase, which removes methylgroups from a pair of lysine residues onhistone H3, provides some answers.Stanley Ng, a graduate student at theSGC and the University of Oxford,determined the structure of the enzymebound to histones with different formsof methylated lysines. This structural analysis will help toclarify the molecular basis of histonemodification, and may also be astarting-point for the development ofchemical inhibitors. New chemical leads are also arising from work on PIM kinases, a class ofenzymes involved in cell signalling.Structural studies revealed an unusualbinding site for a particular class ofinhibitors (imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazines).Unlike similar inhibitors, they blockaccess of ATP to the enzyme's activesite rather than competing directly atthe actual binding site. They are thusmore selective inhibitors. One of themore active inhibitors suppressed thegrowth of a variety of leukaemic celllines, illustrating their promise astargets for therapeutic intervention.

Diamond is also home to the Trust- funded Membrane Protein Laboratory,run by Diamond Fellow Professor SoIwata, which is providing support forresearchers working with membraneproteins. Such proteins are central tomany biological processes but aredifficult to crystallise, making structuralstudies problematic.

A key step inthis process will be early testing ofnew therapies, and ClinicalResearch Facilities are ideal sites inwhich to carry out this research. Many kinds of approach are being explored. Gene-based therapies haveyet to realise the benefits initially hopedfor, but research continues on possiblestrategies, particularly in the promisingarea of DNA vaccines. In Birmingham,for example, a phase I study is beingcarried out of a cancer treatment basedon an engineered herpes simplex virusproducing granulocyte-macrophagecolony-stimulating factor, whichenhances the immune responseagainst cancer cells. Meanwhile, in Southampton, highly promising results have been obtainedin a prostate cancer treatment, in whichan electroporation technique is used todeliver immune-stimulating DNAvaccines. Preliminary results suggest that thetechnique is safe and feasible for use inpeople and stimulates strong immuneresponses. Gene-based studies demand specially trained support staff, found only inClinical Research Facilities. The same istrue of the challenging neurosurgeryresearch being carried out inBirmingham. A pioneeringneurosurgical study is examining thepotential of deep-brain stimulation toreduce long-term dependence onlevodopa in Parkinson's disease. Thistechnique is also a possible treatmentfor Tourette syndrome. One of Manchester's specialist areas is magnetic resonance imaging, whichhas many possible applications. Forexample, a study is using the techniqueto optimise monoclonal antibodytherapy, seeking to improve thetreatment of people colorectalcancer. Studies hosted at Clinical ResearchFacilities (CRFs) reveal diseasemechanisms and test experimentalnew therapies. Such work takes timeto influence practice, but some studieshave more immediate impact. The Southampton CRF has been contributing to a multicentre trialassessing the value of early antibioticuse in people with severe, acutenecrotising pancreatitis. The trial foundno evidence of benefit in preventinginfection or improving survival. Theresults have led to changes in localpractice - helping to reduce antibioticusage and lessen the risks of hospital-acquired infections. Other work has led to validation of biomarkers of liver fibrosis identified atthe CRF. A non-invasive blood test, theEnhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) Test, candetect early stages of liver fibrosis - ofvalue, as the condition is potentiallyreversible if caught early. The test ischeaper than a liver biopsy. It receivedregulatory approval in May 2007. Southampton has also become involved in substance abuse in sport. A growthhormone doping test, developed fromwork carried out in the CRF, hasentered the validation process prior tocommercial release.

Active management of a diversified investment portfolio led to furtherexcellent growth in the Trust's assets,even during the credit squeeze inautumn 2007. During the year, theTrust's investment base rose by\u00a31.7bn, from \u00a313.4bn to \u00a315.1bn. The success of this year's asset management - a return of 17 per cent -continues a period of excellentperformance. Returns over the pastthree years have averaged 17.6 per cent,and over the past five years 15.7 percent, against a net target of 6 per cent.Over each of the past five years,investment returns have exceeded\u00a31bn; cumulative gains in the periodhave been more than \u00a38bn. Over the longer term, since the flotation of Wellcome plc in 1986, annual returnshave been 16.2 per cent, significantlyhigher than global equity total returnsand the Trust's targets. At the same time, the Trust has been developing a number of sophisticatedtools to monitor and manage risks in its investment portfolio. This hassignificantly reduced volatility of investment values over time. Returns quoted are nominal figures (i.e. before adjustment for inflation).TAKING THE TEMPERATURE An independent survey of opinion leaders and grantholders revealedpositive views, along with somesuggestions for improvement. During 2007, the Trust commissioned Ipsos MORI to undertake anindependent opinion audit of importantTrust stakeholders, to find out abouttheir perceptions of the Trust and itswork. Ipsos MORI interviewed 51opinion formers (such as representativesfrom academia, government, otherfunding organisations and the media)and received over 1200 responses toan online survey of grantholders. The findings were extremely positive. Familiarity with the Trust's core activitieswas high, and stakeholders associatedvalues such as 'excellence','professional conduct' and 'dynamism'with the Trust. Most said that theywould speak very favourably about theTrust and its activities. There was a lower awareness of the Trust's work outside biomedical research;some felt the Trust could do more tocommunicate its international activities. In terms of the future, there was a desire to see more communication on theTrust's strategic direction and fundingopportunities. Opinion leaders alsosuggested that the Trust should considerits niche in the light of the opportunitiesand challenges arising from the changingbiomedical research landscape, both inthe UK and internationally.NEW FACES The Wellcome Trust has beenreorganising - bringing in morescientific expertise and gearing up fora new grants management system. This year saw a new senior scientific team put together, with considerableexperience in basic science andtranslational medicine. Professor Richard Morris joined the Trust to take up a role as Head ofNeuroscience and Mental Health, whilemaintaining his group in Edinburgh. AlanSchafer, new Head of Molecular andPhysiological Sciences, co-founded thebiotech company Hexagen, and has ledGlaxoSmithKline's TechnologyDevelopment Department. Pat Goodwin remains Head of Pathogens, Immunology and PopulationStudies and Jimmy Whitworth Head ofInternational Activities. Completing thesenior team, Catherine Quinn, previouslyat the University of Oxford, is heading upa new Grants Management department. The new Grant System being launched in 2008 will provide grantholders with morescope to manage grants and applicationselectronically. Nevertheless, applicantsand grantholders clearly appreciatepersonal interactions with Trust staff, andthe new structure is designed to providea service better tailored to their needs. The reorganisation is part of an ongoing scrutiny of operating costs to ensurethat the Trust is run efficiently whilecontinuing to provide a high-qualityservice. Governors and senior staff Professor Richard Hynes, a HowardHughes Medical Institute Investigator at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, was appointed a Governorin January 2007. Professor Adrian Birdwas appointed Deputy Chairman, for athree-year term until 31 March 2010.Professor Ron Plasterk left the Board ofGovernors, having taken up a new roleas the Dutch minister of research anduniversities. Professor Martin Bobrow,Professor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz andProfessor Dame Jean Thomas also leftthe Board. Dr Mark Walport's position as Director of the Wellcome Trust was extended for asecond term to 2013. Dr Walport andthe Chairman of the Wellcome Trust, Sir William Castell, were invited by theUK Government to join the HealthInnovation Council. Chaired by LordDarzi, the Council is charged withpromoting innovation, from discoveryto take-up by health systems. Dr Walport was also appointed to theboard of the new Office for StrategicCoordination of H ealth Research (OSCHR). Established after the 2006Cooksey Report, OSCHR is chargedwith developing a single integratedHealth Research Strategy for Englandcovering all areas of health research. Several senior staff joined during the year (see left). Wellcome CollectionThis year saw the opening of WellcomeCollection, a major new public venuelocated in the Trust's former headquartersbuilding at 183 Euston Road (see pages26 and 51). As well as exhibition andevents space, it houses the WellcomeLibrary, the Wellcome Trust Centre forthe History of Medicine at UCL, and anew Conference Centre. Contributions to policy making The Trust has worked with a range ofpartners to draw attention to thethreats to research posed by the EUPhysical Agents (ElectromagneticFields) Directive. Approved by theEuropean Commission in 2004, theDirective was intended to protectworkers exposed to electromagneticfields. However, the legislation couldalso limit the use of magneticresonance imaging (MRI) for research,diagnosis and treatment. Unusually, inlight of the evidence presented, the ECannounced in October 2007 thatimplementation of the Directive wouldbe delayed, to allow further discussion. The Trust also provided MEPs with access to information about the use ofnon-human primates in medicalresearch. This followed a proposal thata timetable be set to phase out primateuse across the EU. The Trust contributed to the debate on animal-human hybrid embryos. A UKGovernment White Paper revealed plansto outlaw such hybrids, a move thatwould have denied scientists a valuableresearch tool. Following input from theTrust and others, and a publicconsultation that found general publicsupport for hybrid use in medicalresearch, plans for a ban were dropped. The potential to use electronic patient records in research, through theConnecting for Health initiative, has beena major focus during the year. Use ofpatients' medical information couldprove invaluable in research, and is anarea in which the UK, with its nationwideNational Health Service, has a distinctadvantage. A public consultationcommissioned by the Trust revealedthat the public are positive aboutparticipating in research and sharingpersonal data if effective systems are inplace to ensure informed consent,anonymity and security of their data. Data sharing and release remained a priority. This year saw the launch of UKPubMed Central, set up by the Trust, aspart of a group of leading UK researchfunders in partnership with the BritishLibrary. From 1 October 2006, it becamea formal condition that all researchpapers funded in whole or in part by theTrust must be made freely accessible.The Trust also announced a new datamanagement and sharing policy. CORPORATE ACTIVITIES 2006/07 A brief overview of the Wellcome Trust's corporate activities over the year.OVERVIEW 41 1Professor Adrian Bird, the Trust's new technology.Images1 23FINANCIAL SUMMARY 2006/07 In the year ending 30 September 2007, the Wellcome Trust's total charitable expenditure was \u00a3519.8m.FINANCIAL SUMMARY 2006/07 42 Total charitable expenditure for the year grew slightly to \u00a3520 million (2006: \u00a3484m), mainly due to higherScience Funding and TechnologyTransfer grants expenditure. The total grants awarded increased by \u00a334m, owing to a small rise in fundingrates and the number of grants funded. Expenditure on activities managed directly by the Trust was similar to lastyear's figure. Support costs increasedslightly, mainly as a result of expenditureon a new grants management systemand associated restructuring costs (see page 40). Careers Expenditure on careers support totalled\u00a3125.5m, an increase of \u00a325m over2005/06. Seven Principal ResearchFellowships were awarded or renewedover the year. Funding for SeniorResearch Fellowships also increased,and this was the first year of funding of Sir Henry Wellcome Fellowships foroutstanding researchers at the beginningof their careers. International Some \u00a341.4m was awarded directly toresearchers at overseas institutions. Of this, \u00a321.6m was for the support ofresearch at the Trust's Major OverseasProgrammes in South-east Asia(Thailand and Vietnam) and Africa(Kenya, Malawi and South Africa). A further \u00a333.3m was awarded toresearchers at UK institutions forresearch to be carried out overseas.Total international funding, \u00a374.7m,was slightly higher than in 2005/06. Infrastructure Support specifically for buildings,refurbishment, equipment andresources amounted to \u00a313.4m. This figure does not include thesignificant expenditure on equipment or infrastructure provided as part ofother Trust grants.BREAKDOWN OF WELLCOME TRUST CHARITABLE EXPENDITURE 2006/07 Total: \u00a3519.8m OTHER EXPENDITURE DIRECT ACTIVITIES: \u00a340.6M Direct activities are those managed by the Wellcome Trust itself or in partnership with others.

The Trust holds a world-class portfolio of investments widely diversified acrossasset type and geographical region.Rather than restrictive strategicbenchmarks, the Trust's approach toasset management is a flexible anddynamic approach, based on theidentification of the best investmentopportunities wherever and in whateverform they may arise. A return of 17.0 percent in 2006/07 reflects the success ofthis commitment to excellence and focuson absolute return. Public equities enjoyed another strong year, with gains in excess of 40 per centin Asian and emerging markets. Holdingsin UK equities were again reduced, to14.7 per cent of total assets. More thanhalf of the Trust's portfolio is now held in'alternative' assets (hedge funds, buyoutfunds, venture, property and emergingmarket equities). The Trust's commitment to hedge funds rose to \u00a33.1bn. The Trust is also seedingup to US$550m in funds, principallyhedge funds, managed by New SmithCapital Partners, and is taking a financialinterest in the group. The Trust remains a major investor in private equity, with investments in over500 partnerships and total commitmentsin excess of \u00a33.8bn. Net annual returnshave exceeded 21 per cent. The Trust's property portfolio continued to prosper, the 36 per cent gain in thevalue of residential property alsoreflecting the benefits of active portfoliomanagement. Returns quoted are nominal figures (i.e. before adjustment for inflation). *Excluding support costs.Direct expenditure Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Grants awardedFUNDING DEVELOPMENTS 2006/07 An overview of strategy development, new initiatives, significant changes to funding policies, and an analysis of the year's funding.FUNDING DEVELOPMENTS 2006/07 44 NEW FUNDING INITIATIVES A new partnership between the Wellcome Trust and the US NationalInstitutes of Health (NIH) enablespostgraduate students to undertakefour-year PhD training in centres in theUK or Republic of Ireland and the NIHat Bethesda, Maryland. Through a new programme run in partnership with the Howard HughesMedical Institute (HHMI), postdoctoralresearchers working with a major Trustaward holder can join the laboratory ofan HHMI investigator for up to one year(and vice versa). A new initiative will support interdisciplinary research trainingprogrammes for clinicians intranslational medicine andtherapeutics. Programmes will enableclinicians to combine a rigorousgrounding in the principles oftranslational medicine with researchopportunities that apply the latestapproaches to important clinicalproblems. Programmes will beunderpinned by partnerships betweenUK academic institutions and industry. A \u00a310.7 million initiative in clinical veterinary research was launched, inpartnership with the seven UKveterinary schools. Funding of \u00a37m willbe used to create fellowships atdifferent career stages. The remaining\u00a33.7m will be available for small grantssuch as vacation scholarships.GLOBAL HEALTH RESEARCHA major new initiative was launched in2007 to strengthen the institutionalresearch base in Africa, particularly inuniversities. Funding will be provided toenhance research facilities in Africanresearch centres that are part ofconsortia or networks linked to leadinghigher education institutions in the UKor elsewhere. Some \u00a310m was also committed to health research capacity developmentin Kenya and Malawi, with matchingfunds from the UK Government'sDepartment for InternationalDevelopment and \u00a31m from theInternational Development ResearchCentre, Canada. Funding through thisinitiative will become available in 2008and, unusually, local funding schemeswill be established and administereddirectly by national bodies. The Trust also expanded its global health fellowship schemes. The newFellowships in Public Health andTropical Medicine provide a completecareer ladder for researchers atacademic institutions in developingcountries. FACILITATING RESEARCH A new funding initiative was launched in2007 to support the development anduse of electronic patient recordresources in health research, inpartnership with the Economic andSocial Research Council, theEngineering and Physical SciencesResearch Council and the MedicalDEVELOPING PEOPLE US-UK funding partnerships Translational medicine and therapeutics programmeClinical veterinary research training initiative GLOBAL HEALTH RESEARCH Research capacity strengthening in African institutionsMalawi and Kenya capacity development The Wellcome Trust's funding isbased around funding streams,covering core areas of biomedicalscience and the medical humanities.Cutting across these streams arefunding programmes in TechnologyTransfer and Public Engagement(see below). Each funding stream has associated with it one or more Funding Committees,responsible for most funding decisions.Strategy Committees advise the Truston needs and opportunities (4)Medical Humanities; (5) TechnologyTransfer; and (6) Public Engagement. The funding streams offer a variety of forms of support, such as project andprogramme grants, and careerdevelopment awards. Technology Transfer funding comprises Translation Awards and StrategicTranslation Awards, as well as StrategicTranslation Awards in Seeding DrugDiscovery. Public Engagement issupported primarily through theEngaging Science programme, whichincludes Society Awards, PeopleAwards and Arts Awards. Occasionallarge Capital Awards are made tosupport nationally or internationallyimportant developments. Strategic Awards and some other large or unusual awards are considered by aStrategic Awards Committee. Wellcome Trust funding streams. Immunology and Infectious Disease Populations andPublic Health Neuroscience andMental Health PhysiologicalSciences Molecules,Genes and Cells MedicalHumanitiesFUNDING DEVELOPMENTS 2006/07 45 Research Council. Proposals were sought in three areas: health researchusing electronic patient records andcohort databases, trainingprogrammes and workshops, andpublic engagement activities. A new capital funding scheme, to be run every two years, will provide fundsfor new buildings or refurbishment ofexisting laboratories. Up to \u00a330m isavailable for the first round of funding. A one-off call for proposals was launched for genome-wide associationstudies in common, complex disease,using DNA samples from existingdisease collections or cohorts. Ascheme was launched to provideaccess to commercially produced geneknockout mouse strains. This resourcewill be coordinated by the EuropeanMutant Mouse Archive. USING KNOWLEDGE The Trust committed \u00a350m over fiveyears to a new Health InnovationChallenge Fund, with matching fundingfrom the UK Department of Health. The\u00a3100m fund will be used to support thetranslation of research into newproducts and approaches to treatdisease. A specific initiative was launched to promote research on vaccineadjuvants, agents that improve thebody's response to vaccines. Thisinitiative was open to researchersoutside the UK and scientists inindustry as well as academia.MEDICAL HUMANITIESA call for Strategic Award proposals inthe medical humanities was launched,to provide support for major venturesexploring the human experience ofmedicine. The Trust's Biomedical Ethics Programme was substantially revised,with an immediate priority of buildingcapacity and quality by supportingcentres or collaborations. After thisinitial phase, attention will shift tofellowship and other support. Capital funding is also available in these areas (see above). PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT A new Arts Awards scheme waslaunched in 2007, building on thesuccess of previous Pulse and Sciartfunding. Broadcast DevelopmentAwards were launched to enable early-stage ideas for media projects to bedeveloped into full proposals that canbe used to secure further funding or abroadcasting platform.

Many of these have raised additionalinvestment and a number have already developed products. This yearsaw the first awards made in the Seeding Drug Discovery initiative.Support was also provided for development of a range of newtechnologies, in diagnostics, surgery and other areas. Translation Awards support a diverse array of technologies, not only from biology but also from the physicalsciences and mathematics; they areavailable to both academic institutionsand early-stage companies. Of 27applications received from 17institutions during 2006/07, 26 per centwere awarded. The mean value ofthese awards has been \u00a3646 000(range \u00a3240 000-1.0 million) and theaverage duration 25 months (range10-36 months). The average time fromapplication to decision is around threeto four months. The projects address a wide range of potential applications, includingtherapeutics, vaccines, diagnostics,medical devices and enablingtechnologies. Examples include thedevelopment and evaluation of aninjectable scaffold for reconstructivesurgery, preclinical and clinical studiesof a novel meningococcal vaccine,clinical studies into the therapeuticmanagement of inflammatory boweldisease, and research to improve thereliability and safety of medicinalinfusions outside a clinical environment. Other awards were for the development of a drug delivery systemfor the treatment of brain tumours,research into a cell-based DNA sequencing usingsingle molecule tunnelling techniques. Strategic Translation Awards are designed to support translationalresearch in areas of key importance tothe Wellcome Trust. Twelveapplications have been considered todate, in diagnostics, vaccination,regenerative medicine, genotypingtechnology and drug discovery. Themean value of awards has been \u00a33.2m(range \u00a31.3-8.1m). New awards weremade this year to two multidisciplinaryteams working at the interface betweenengineering and medicine, tackling twoimportant medical issues: diagnosis oftuberculosis (page 22) and minimalinvasive surgery (page 23). An award of \u00a37.6m was made to Dr Helen Lee to support research anddevelopment into rapid diagnostics forinfectious diseases. The programme,based at the University of Cambridgeand within Diagnostics for the RealWorld Ltd, builds on earlier work on arapid test for chlamydia infection, laterapplied to other sexually transmittedinfections and to trachoma. Dr Lee'steam is also working on proof-of-concept studies of a new DNAamplification technology that couldoffer an alternative to polymerase chainreaction chemistry for DNA detectionassays. The \u00a391m Seeding Drug Discoveryinitiative, launched in 2005, made tenawards in its first two rounds offunding. Eight awards were for full drugdiscovery programmes in therapeuticareas spanning bacterial infections,cancer, amyloidosis, obesity, multiplesclerosis and inflammation. The mean value of these awards has been \u00a32.8m (range \u00a31.3-4.0m) and theaverage duration is 30 months (range24-36 months). Two smaller awardswere made to explore the feasibility ofnovel approaches to the treatment ofaspergillosis and management ofallergy. The scheme has continued toattract considerable interest from theacademic community and companiesalike, and the competition has beenexpanded to two rounds a year. Several companies that received support during early validation of theirtechnology have had success in raisingfurther funds. These include the start-up companies Celltran Ltd, SenexsisLtd, Polytherics Ltd and PopulationGenetics Technologies Ltd. Anothergroup of companies successfullyconcluded terms under which theywere acquired by public companies,including Paradigm Therapeutics Ltd,DanioLabs Ltd and OxxonTherapeutics Ltd. EmergentBiosolutions floated on the New YorkStock Exchange. Overall, Trust-fundedcompanies have raised over \u00a3155m to date.WELLCOME TRUST GENOME CAMPUS The Wellcome Trust Genome Campus at Hinxton, near Cambridge, is home to the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the Wellcome Trust Conference Centre and Wellcome Trust Advanced Courses.WELLCOME TRUST GENOME CAMPUS 49 The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute continues to be highly productive, in terms of both genome sequencing and published outputs. The AdvancedCourses programme has been expanding both its UK-based andinternational activities, while the Wellcome Trust Conference Centre hasattracted leading speakers to a series of high-profile scientific events. Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute The Sanger Institute has been furtherdeveloping its emphasis on humangenetics over the last 12 months,culminating in the appointment ofProfessor Leena Peltonen as Head ofHuman Genetics. Professor Peltonen isan acknowledged leader in studies ofthe molecular basis of both single-genedisorders and more common complexdiseases. Professor Aarno Palotie alsojoined the Sanger Institute, and theseappointments strengthen the Institute'sresearch into human disease. The Sanger Institute's new strategy, developed in 2006, sets out ways tocapitalise on the major contributionspreviously made to genome sequencingand high-throughput projects, with aspecial emphasis on genetic variationand its impact on health. Sangerresearchers continued to publish in high-impact scientific journals, appearing asauthors on more than 260 originalresearch papers - an increase of 20 percent over 2005/06 - including 38 inNature, Nature Genetics, Science or Proceedings of the National Academyof Sciences (USA) . These articles include many of the discoveries of the CancerGenome Project (see page 7), theENCODE Consortium (pages 6-7) andpathogen sequencing projects (pages10-11). The Sanger Institute's work with the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortiumhas resulted in major publications (page6). The Institute has received a majoraward to undertake a second phase ofthe project to refine mapping of variantsand to study copy number variation, anarea where the Institute is a worldleader (pages 6-7). Other papersdescribed genes involved in X-linkeddeficits in mental development,diabetes and other common diseases. As part of the development in Genome Campus conferences, Sanger Institutestaff organised international conferenceson hearing, geneticsand DECIPHER, of sub-microscopic chromosomal anomaliesimplicated in disease or abnormaldevelopment. This will be an area ofgrowth in coming years. The Sanger Institute's Public Engagement Programme opened itsnew visitor space during the year andrelaunched www.yourgenome.org. It also made a major contribution to thenational travelling exhibition projectInside DNA: A genomic revolution , while continuing to develop resourcesand experiences for age 14+ students,for teachers and for adult groups. Wellcome Trust Advanced Courses The Wellcome Trust Advanced Coursesprogramme organised nine AdvancedCourses and six workshops at theWellcome Trust Genome Campus, andthree workshops overseas. Twobioinformatics workshops were held atthe IT training room previously set up atthe Institute of Hygiene in Montevideo,Uruguay. With the support of SangerInstitute instructors, previous participantsare being encouraged to become thetrainers of the future. An IT training room was set up in Kilifi,Kenya, at the Kenya Medical ResearchInstitute-Wellcome Trust ResearchProgramme and a workshop, 'Workingwith Pathogen Genomes', was held inDecember 2006, with scientistsattending from all over Africa. Next year will see new Advanced Courses in Hinxton on molecularvirology, global analysis of fission yeastgene function, and small molecule drugdiscovery, as well as the developmentof IT training rooms at the WellcomeTrust Major Overseas Programmes inVietnam and Malawi. Meetings Programme and Conference CentreA total of 16 meetings were held atHinxton as part of the Wellcome TrustMeetings Programme in 2006/07.Highlights included the 'Genomics ofCommon Diseases' conference held inJuly 2007 jointly with Nature Genetics . This event showcased many of theresearch projects funded by the CaseControl Consortium, with the auditoriumat full capacity. Over \u00a32 million of business was run through the Conference Centre, almostthree-quarters being aligned with theTrust's mission and hence charged atsubsidised rates. The remainingbusiness filled gaps in the conferencediary and generated sufficient profit tosubsidise the scientific events. A study is currently underway to determine the options and cost plansfor expanding the conference facilities. PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT The Wellcome Trust's Public Engagement activities aim to engage with society to foster a climate within which biomedical science can flourish.PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT 50 While the opening of Wellcome Collection was the highlight of the year in public engagement, grant-giving continued to be an area of significantactivity. Planning began for work associated with Darwin anniversaries in 2009, and the year also saw the development of new strategies foreducation and broadcast. Grants A total of 86 grants were awardedunder the \u00a33 million Engaging Sciencefunding programme and one capitalgrant of \u00a3600 000 was made. Society Awards: Six large awards (over \u00a330 000) were made for a range of important activities. One award wasmade to Dean Madden at the NationalCentre for Biotechnology Education inReading to provide practicalbioinformatics activities enabling biologystudents aged 16-19 to explore modernevidence for evolution. In addition, fourawards were made to support academicresearch about public engagement. People Awards: Some 48 awards (up to \u00a330 000) were made to support a diverse range of activities, includingperformances, exhibitions, talks,conferences, debates anddocumentaries. A notable award wasto Deafinitely Theatre (above), the UK'sonly deaf-led professional theatrecompany, to develop a production thatexplored issues surrounding cochlearimplants in a deaf child. Arts Awards: In February 2007, the Wellcome Trust launched its new Arts Awards funding scheme to build on thework of the Sciart and Pulse schemes.Since its launch, 25 small grants (up to\u00a330 000) and three large grants havebeen awarded. One award was toSamantha Moore to produce An Eyeful of Sound, a short animated documentaryfilm that explores synaesthesia,incorporating conversations withsynaesthetes as well as visualinterpretations of their synaestheticreactions to everyday sounds. Capital Award: A grant of \u00a3600 000 was awarded to Professor Fran Balkwill to develop Centre of the Cell - a newinteractive exhibition for childrenlocated in east London (see page 29). Education In June 2007, the Trust approved a newEducation Strategy. Central to this is thedesire to establish the Trust as a majorinfluence on school-focused educationfrom primary stages onwards. In September 2007, the Trust and the US National Science Foundationhosted an international conferenceexamining 'the national value of scienceeducation'. The Trust is also supportinga project examining the impact ofassessment on science education atthe end of Key Stage 2 (10-11-year-olds). This work is being undertaken bythe Institute of Education and IpsosMORI. The study will also comparepupils' and teachers' attitudes andlearning outcomes in England withthose in Wales, which recently withdrewend of Key Stage 2 assessment. Two issues of the Big Picture series, a publication for post-16 students and teachers, were published - onepidemics and evolution. Bothpublications are available online. New developments The Trust has initiated a programme tomark the bicentenary in 2009 of thebirth of Charles Darwin and 150 yearssince the publication of On the Origin ofSpecies. Activities will include a seriesof Darwin-inspired biomedicalexperiments available to everyschoolchild in the UK, a number ofbroadcast and web projects, and acultural initiative. The Trust has also begun to implement its new broadcast strategy, which willcombine training and developmentactivities for scientists andbroadcasters and provide a smallamount of highly targeted funding. In conjunction with the development of a Trust-wide international strategy, a public engagement strand has beendeveloped with a focus on developingcountries. Supporting researchers Support for Wellcome Trust-fundedresearchers expanded in 2007 with theprovision of a web resource, responsivesupport and training sessions. TheTrust hosted two events for youngresearchers explaining how to engagewith different audiences, while Fellowswere able to attend a session onengaging and influencing peoplethrough use of narrative techniques. The Trust has sought to improve institutional support for researcherengagement through the Beacons for Public Engagement scheme, inpartnership with the UK FundingCouncils and RCUK (UK ResearchCouncils). The Trust also continues its support of the Researchers inResidence scheme, in partnership with the RCUK.WELLCOME COLLECTION Wellcome Collection is a free public venue hosting events and permanent and temporary exhibitions. It also houses the Wellcome Library, the Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL, a Conference Centre, a forum and events spaces, a bookshop and a caf\u00e9.WELLCOME COLLECTION 51 Wellcome Collection opened to the public on 21 June 2007.
