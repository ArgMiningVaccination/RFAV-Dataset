Additional safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are needed in a timely manner to adequately address the pandemic on an international scale. Such safe and effective vaccines would beespecially appealing for international deployment if they also have favorable stability, supply, and potential for implementa- tion in mass vaccination campaigns. Randomized trials provide particularly reliable insights about vaccine efficacy and safety. While enhanced efficiency and interpretability can be obtained from placebo-controlled trials, in settings wheretheir conduct is no longer possible, randomized non-inferiority trials may enable obtaining reliable evaluations of experi- mental vaccines through direct comparison with active comparator vaccines established to have worthwhile efficacy. Methods: The usual objective of non-inferiority trials is to reliabl y assess whether the efficacy of an experimental vaccine is not unacceptably worse than that of an active control vaccine previously established to be effective, likely in a placebo- controlled trial. This is formally achieved by ruling out a non-i nferiority margin identified to be the minimum threshold for what would constitute an unacceptable loss of efficacy. This art icle not only investigates non-inferiority margins, denoted by d, that address the usual objective of determining whether the ex perimental vaccine is ''at least similarly effective to'' the active comparator vaccine in the non-inferiority trial , but also develops non-inferiority margins, denoted by d o,i n t e n d e dt o address the worldwide need for multiple safe and effective vaccines by satisfying the less stringent requirement that theexperimental vaccine be ''at least similarly effective to'' an active comparator vaccine having efficacy that satisfies the widely accepted World Health Organization-F ood and Drug Administration criteria for ''worthwhile'' vaccine efficacy. Results: Using the margin denables non-inferiority trials to reliably evaluate experimental vaccines that truly are simi- larly effective to an active comparator vaccine having any level of ''worthwhile'' efficacy. When active comparator vac- cines have efficacy in the range of 50%-70%, non-inferiority trials designed to use the margin d ohave appealing properties, especially for experimental vaccines having true efficacy of approximately 60%.Conclusion: Non-inferiority trials using the proposed margins may enable reliable randomized evaluations of efficacy and safety of experimental COVID-19 vaccines. Such trials often require approximately two- to three-fold the person- years follow-up than a placebo-controlled trial. This could be achieved, without substantive increases in sample size, byincreasing the average duration of follow-up from 2 months to approximately 4-6 months, assuming efficacy of the active comparator vaccine has been reliably evaluated over that longer duration.

New vaccines have been developed and testing begun at an unprecedented pace, with at least seven vaccines inongoing placebo-controlled randomized trials. 1 Additional vaccines are expected to enter placebo- controlled trials soon, including through the imminent initiation of the World Health Organization (WHO)Solidarity Vaccines Trial 2that follows the principles of a core protocol.3This platform trial is designed to eval- uate multiple candidate vaccines against a common pla- cebo control, where new candidates can be added to the randomization as soon as they become available, meetlocal regulatory standards, and meet WHO's prioritiza-tion criteria. 4These trials are rigorously designed with ''virologically confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 symptomatic disease'' as the primary endpoint. If ''vac-cine efficacy'' denotes the relative reduction in the rateof such primary endpoint events in a vaccinated group of participants compared to placebo controls, then the WHO- and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-rec-ommended standard for worthwhile efficacy is having apoint estimate of \u00f850% vaccine efficacy with a 95% confidence interval (CI) lower bound of \u00f830% efficacy, chosen to assure that deployed vaccines do more good than harm. 5,6 Recently, initial reports of high efficacy in the short term for several vaccines have been published. Two vac- cines manufactured by Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna, which use novel mRNA technology, are yielding esti-mated efficacy of 94%-95% 7,8over a median follow-up of about 2 months. Additional reports of two vaccines that use Adenovirus vectors also have been disclosed, from AstraZeneca/Oxford in the United Kingdom andthe Gamaleya Research Institute in Russia, with initialestimates of efficacy ranging from 62%-92%. 9,10 The mRNA-based vaccines have started to become available, and access is expected to increase in manywealthy nations over the next several months.However, these vaccines have significant challenges in manufacturing and distribution, with requirements for cold temperatures during transport and storage thatmay make them particularly challenging for worldwidedistribution in the short term. The adenovirus vaccineshave potential advantages over the mRNA-based vac- cines in manufacturability and distribution; with some countries including India building capacity to manufac-ture their own supply in the near future, theAstraZeneca vaccine may become available to a wide set of countries before the mRNA vaccines can. However, even with these exciting reports, it is still important that other vaccine regimens be evaluated.Widespread implementation of multiple safe and effec- tive vaccines will be needed given the breadth of the pandemic. Vaccines that can be administered in a single dose would be particularly useful in mass vaccinationcampaigns, and open questions remain about the dur-ability of any vaccine effects and the potential for emer- ging concerns about safety. Methods Non-inferiority studies can be an important tool inevaluating the efficacy of a new vaccine when there is one established in that population, and when randomi-zation to placebo is not possible. The frequent goal in a non-inferiority trial is to reliably assess whether the efficacy of an experimental vaccine is not unacceptablyworse than that of an active control vaccine that previ-ously had been established to be effective, likely in a placebo-controlled trial. This is formally achieved by identifying a minimum threshold for what would con-stitute an unacceptable loss of efficacy, that is, a non-inferiority margin, and then designing the non- inferiority trial to rule out that margin. An important consideration in the design and conduct of non-inferiority trials is the need to address the inherentuncertainty about whether the effect of the active com- parator vaccine, as estimated in its placebo-controlled trial, reliably represents its true effect in the setting ofthe non-inferiority trial. This is referred to as the con- stancy assumption. To illustrate the fundamental importance of the con- stancy assumption, suppose an active comparator vac-cine truly has vaccine efficacy of 95% over a short 2- month duration of follow-up, and true vaccine efficacy of 88% over 6 months of follow-up. Suppose furtherthat, in its placebo-controlled trial, the active control vaccine was evaluated over only 2 months, but the non- inferiority trial will follow for events over 6 months. Ifit was inaccurately assumed that the active comparatorvaccine would have the same 95% vaccine efficacy over 6 months, the resulting violation of the constancy assumption would lead to meaningfully overestimatingan experimental vaccine with true 30% vaccine efficacyas being 71% = 100 [1 - (1 20.3){(1 20.95)/ (120.88)}]%. Based on these insights, one important consideration in the identification of the margin in the non-inferiority trial is to address the inherent uncertainty about the validity of the constancy assumption, while a secondrelates to ensuring the experimental vaccine achievesproper preservation of effect. These two are formally stated to be as follows: 11 Consideration A: the non-inferiority margin should beformulated using adjustments to account for bias or336 Clinical Trials 18(3)lack of reliability in the estimate of the effect of the active comparator regimen in the setting of the non- inferiority trial. Consideration B: the non-inferiority margin should beformulated to achieve preservation of an appropriate percentage of the effect of the active comparator regimen. One could take several approaches to properly address Considerations A and B when formulating margins in non-inferiority trials, especially in the spe- cific context of vaccines to stop a pandemic. A widely implemented approach with precedent for regulatorysupport is the ''95-95'' method, 11,12,13in which Consideration A is addressed by assuming the true effect of the active comparator vaccine in the non-infer- iority trial would be the lower limit of the 95% CI for its estimated vaccine efficacy in the setting of the previ-ously conducted randomized placebo-controlled trial(s); Consideration B is often addressed by preser- ving at least 50% of the effect of the active comparatorvaccine, where, as discussed below, this effect is esti- mated using the active comparator to placebo hazard ratio (HR) in this time-to-event analysis setting. Cox regression analyses are used to estimate the HR or relative rates of primary endpoint events on a vac-cine versus a comparator regimen. Data from the placebo-controlled randomized trial that established the active comparator vaccine as having worthwhileefficacy are used to estimate the active comparator to placebo HR and, in turn, the active comparator's vac- cine efficacy is estimated as 100 (1 2HR). Working in the context of the estimated HR and thus, using the log-scale when calculating half the estimated effect, weare led to the following formula 12for the non- inferiority margin d: d=\u00f095% CI upper limit of the HR \u00de \u00f095% CI upper limit of the HR \u00de\u00bd()/C01 \u00f01\u00de The term, (95% CI upper limit of the HR)\u00bd, is the ''preservation of effect'' adjustment and addresses Consideration B. Note that equation (1) simplifies to d= (95% CI upper limit of the HR)2\u00bd, but we leave it in the expanded form in order to parallel proposed alternate margins below. If the trial is conducted in a setting where there would be emerging availability of an effective vaccine and thus that would be a proper control regimen, yet ata time when current availability of safe and effective vaccines would not meet local and worldwide needs, then a non-inferiority margin more lenient than din equation (1) might be justified. Specifically, it may be sufficient that the strength of evidence of efficacy ofthe new vaccine in the non-inferiority trial would be equivalent to the strength of evidence meeting theWHO-FDA criteria for success in a placebo-controlled trial. In essence, the justification for using a weaker cri- terion is the recognition that multiple vaccines that are safe and have worthwhile efficacy are needed, even if a new vaccine might be less effective than one or more marketed vaccines previously established to have worthwhile efficacy. Since the WHO-FDA criteria for success, in part, requires evidence ruling out that the active control's vaccine efficacy is 30%, this corre- sponds to the 95% CI upper limit of the active com- parator to placebo HR being 0.70; in turn, the preservation of effect adjustment for a vaccine withefficacy at the threshold of achieving that criterion would be (0.70) \u00bd. This leads to the formula for the alternative non-inferiority margin: do=95% CI upper limit of the hazard ratio\u00f0\u00de 0:70\u00f0\u00de\u00bd()/C01 \u00f02\u00de Hence, in the non-inferiority trial, ruling out that the experimental to active comparator HR is \u00f8do allows the conclusion that the experimental vaccine is ''at least similarly effective to'' an active comparator vaccine having efficacy at the threshold for satisfying the WHO-FDA criteria for success, while ruling outthat that HR is \u00f8dallows the stronger conclusion that the experimental vaccine is ''at least similarly effective to'' the active comparator vaccine in the non-inferiority trial. Finally, there might be reasons to choose a margin between d oandd, or one bounded by a specified maxi- mally acceptable relative increase. For instance, there might be consensus among stakeholders that a non- inferiority margin could be no greater than 3 or 4;hence, ruling out that the experimental vaccine could have triple or quadruple the rate of symptomatic infec- tions compared to an existing vaccine, regardless of the actual efficacy of existing vaccine. For illustration, a margin of min( d,3) or, say, min( d o,4) could be applied. Results We will explore the properties of non-inferiority trials using margins danddoin the context of the current state of COVID-19 vaccine research and development, balancing the feasibility of accruing large sample sizes or long durations of follow-up with appropriate rigor to identify vaccines that are reliably established to be meaningfully effective. We discuss the choice of margin as dependent on the efficacy of the available compara- tor vaccine in the country where the non-inferioritytrial will be conducted. Two scenarios are considered in which an available active control vaccine has reliably estimated efficacy in preventing disease: first where vac- cine efficacy is 90%-95% during the duration of theFleming et al. 337non-inferiority trial, and second where vaccine efficacy is 60% during trial duration. These two scenarios cor-respond to possible situations in countries where themRNA vaccines or adenovirus-vectored vaccines become available, respectively, assuming their early estimates of vaccine efficacy will hold over longer-termfollow-up. Calculations for additional scenarios areincluded in Tables 1-3. The approaches to non-inferiority presented in this article could also be contemplated as part of a hybrid approach, for settings where the placebo control is replaced by an active comparator vaccine, either in thesame or a different trial. The hybrid approach wouldefficiently aggregate evidence about the efficacy of acandidate experimental vaccine, by combining evidenceabout the efficacy of that experimental vaccine obtainedfrom the placebo-controlled and active comparator set-tings. Such hybrid approaches are not further consid- ered here. Scenario 1 Scenario 1 involves the use of an active comparator vaccine having vaccine efficacy that is 95% over2 months and 90% over 6 months, in non-inferioritytrials designed with primary analysis to rule out thenon-inferiority margin, d. The first scenario we consider is the one where a vaccine with very high efficacy becomes available in a region, such as the United States. For illustration pur-poses, we assume that this vaccine has been estimatedto have 95% vaccine efficacy over 2 months and 90%over 6 months. While we consider both timeframes fora potential non-inferiority trial, we note that the num-ber of participants and time to accrue an adequate number of infections with two highly effective vaccines make a 6-month non-inferiority trial more likely. Considering first a 2-month trial, we assume an active comparator vaccine has estimated 95% vaccineefficacy, and a lower bound for the 95% CI of 0.9145from 175 events in the placebo-controlled randomized trial. This level of evidence was achieved by both Moderna and Pfizer at the time of their requests to theFDA to grant an Emergency Use Authorization. 7,8 Translating this onto the HR scale (see Table 1), the estimated active comparator to placebo HR is 0.05,with a 95% CI upper limit of 0.0855. Applying equa- tions (1) and (2), we calculate the margins d= 3.421 and d o= 9.790. To have 90% power to rule out d= 3.421, when preserving a 2.5% false positive error rate, a non-inferiority trial would be required to have34 primary endpoints. The least favorable result to ruleout the d= 3.421 would be an estimated experimental to active control vaccine HR of 1.631, correspondingapproximately to 21 versus 13 events on experimental to active control vaccines, respectively, allowing the conclusion that the experimental vaccine is ''at leastsimilarly effective to'' the active comparator vaccine in the non-inferiority trial. With 34 events, the least favorable result to rule out thed o= 9.790 would be an estimated experimental to active control vaccine HR of 3.795, corresponding approximately to 26 versus 8 events on experimental to active control vaccines, respectively, allowing the con-clusion that the experimental vaccine is ''at least simi- larly effective to'' an active comparator vaccine having efficacy at the threshold for satisfying the WHO-FDAcriteria for success. As shown in Table 3, the experi- mental vaccine would need to have true vaccine efficacy of 95% for the trial would have high power to rule outdand true vaccine efficacy of at least 90% for high power to rule out d o. Consider instead a 6-month trial comparing to an active comparator vaccine with 90% vaccine efficacy based on a randomized trial accruing 350 cases by this 6-month mark. In the HR scale, the estimated activecomparator to placebo HR is 0.10, with a 95% CI upper limit of 0.1348. Applying equations (1) and (2), the margins are d= 2.724 and d o= 6.207. To have 90% power to rule out d, when preserving a 2.5% false positive error rate, a non-inferiority trial would be required to have 48 primary endpoints (Table 1). Theleast favorable result to rule out the d= 2.724 would be an estimated experimental to active comparator vac- cine HR of 1.490, corresponding approximately to 28versus 20 events on experimental to active comparator vaccines, respectively, allowing the conclusion that the experimental vaccine is ''at least similarly effective to''the active comparator vaccine in the non-inferiority trial. With 48 events, the least favorable result to rule out thed o= 6.207 would be an estimated experimental to active comparator vaccine HR of 3.071, corresponding approximately to 36 versus 12 events on experimentalto active control vaccines, respectively, allowing the conclusion that the experimental vaccine is ''at least similarly effective to'' an active comparator vaccinehaving efficacy at the threshold for satisfying the WHO-FDA criteria for success. As shown in Table 3, the experimental vaccine would need to have true vac-cine efficacy of 90% for the trial to have high power to rule out dand true vaccine efficacy of at least 80% for high power to rule out d o. In scenario 1, the 34-event trial comparing two vac- cines having approximate 95% vaccine efficacy and the 48-event trial comparing two vaccines having approxi-mate 90% efficacy would require approximately two- to three-fold person years of follow-up relative to a fre- quently used design of a 150-event placebo-controlledtrial of a vaccine having 60% vaccine efficacy, assuming these trials were conducted in settings having similar attack rates. For this reason, as noted earlier, the sce-nario of the 6-month non-inferiority trial seems more likely.338 Clinical Trials 18(3)Table 2.

While this is disappointing if the experimentalwould be a single dose vaccine with 65% efficacy, suchinsensitivity arguably is appropriate if the highly effec-tive active control vaccine is readily available in a com-munity, since randomization likely would be limited toan experimental vaccine hypothesized to have similarlyhigh efficacy. In addition, this high bar helps protectagainst meaningfully overestimating the efficacy of aninadequately effective experimental vaccine when it iscompared with an active control vaccine for which theefficacy has also been overestimated. Scenario 2 Scenario 2 involves the use of an active comparator vac-cine having vaccine efficacy of 60% over 4-6 months,in non-inferiority trials designed with primary analysisto rule out the non-inferiority margin, d o. Suppose the placebo-controlled evidence for the active comparator vaccine exceeds the threshold formeeting the WHO-FDA criteria for success, by having60% estimated vaccine efficacy and, with 350 events, a lower limit of the 95% CI that is 50.0%. Then, the esti-mated active comparator to placebo HR is 0.4 and the95% CI upper limit of the HR is 0.500. Plugging in the observed upper bound of 0.500 into equations (1) and (2),dwould be 1.415 and d o= 1.674 (see Table 2). This scenario might be close to what we could expect ifthe AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine becomes availablebased on data similar to what has been described in ini- tial reports. 9 Continue to assume the placebo-controlled active comparator trial had 350 events and a new experimen- tal vaccine has true vaccine efficacy of 60%. Then, thealternative hypothesis for the HR for the experimentalto active control vaccine is 1.0. Under the hypothesis that the true HR is 1.0, and preserving a 2.5% false pos- itive error rate, a non-inferiority trial based on a marginofd= 1.415 would be required to have 355 primary endpoints for 90% power (see Table 1), whereas one based on d o= 1.674 would require only 164 events (see Table 2). When using the wider margin do, the least favorable result to rule out that non-inferiority marginwould be an estimated experimental to active compara-tor vaccine HR of 1.226, corresponding approximately to 90 versus 74 events on the experimental versus active comparator vaccines, respectively. When multiplied byTable 3. Consider non-inferiority trials designed with primary analysis to rule out the non-inferiority margin, d, under the assumption that efficacy of the experimental (EXP) and active control (AC) vaccines is equal. While such trials properly are poweredto rule out donly when vaccine efficacy of the EXP vaccine truly is greater than or equal to that of the active control (AC), the trial is powered to rule out the non-inferiority margin, d o, when the vaccine efficacy of the experimental (EXP) is only 10% less than that on the active control (AC). Results are presented corresponding to 175 or 350 events in the placebo-controlled trial of the AC.

As in scenario 1, the 164-event trial in scenario 2 would require approximately two- to three-fold personyears of follow-up relative to a 150-event placebo-controlled trial of a vaccine having 60% vaccine effi-cacy, assuming these trials were conducted in settingshaving similar attack rates. However, unlike scenario 1,in scenario 2\u2014where the active comparator vaccine hasan estimated true vaccine efficacy in the range ofapproximately 60%, as detailed Table 2\u2014trials wouldbe well powered to rule out the non-inferiority margin,d o, for any experimental vaccine having true efficacy of at least 60%, in turn justifying the conclusion that suchvaccines would be ''at least similarly effective to'' anactive comparator vaccine having efficacy at the thresh-old for satisfying the WHO-FDA criteria for success.Thus, conducting trials in scenario 2 would be an effi-cient and reliable approach for increasing available vac- cines with ''worthwhile'' efficacy. Further increases in efficiency could be obtained through interim monitoring. In scenario 2 where theactive comparator vaccine would have vaccine efficacyof 60% over 4-6 months, for an experimental vaccinehaving considerably higher true efficacy, an interimanalysis in the non-inferiority trial could be definitivelypositive. These interim evaluations could be achieved,for example, using standard group sequential monitor-ing boundaries to assess whether interim data are suffi-ciently favorable to rule out the non-inferiority margind. By implementing this approach recently in the HIV Prevention Trials Network #083 non-inferiority trial conducted in the setting of pre-exposure prophylaxisfor HIV infection, 14early termination was justified when the experimental cabotegravir regimen had anestimated 66% relative reduction (HR 0.34, 95% CI0.18, 0.62) in risk of HIV infection against the emtrici-tabine/tenofovir active comparator regimen. Conclusion Non-inferiority trials using margins proposed in thisarticle may provide the ability to obtain reliable rando-mized evaluations of efficacy and safety of experimen-tal COVID-19 vaccines. Such trials are well powered toreliably evaluate experimental vaccines that truly aresimilarly effective to an active comparator vaccine hav- ing any level of ''worthwhile'' efficacy. However, when the active comparator vaccine has efficacy \u00f890%, an important limitation of this non-inferiority approach isits low power to confirm, as worthwhile, a safe andeffective experimental vaccine having a favorable 60%-70% level of efficacy and a desirable profile such ascharacteristics readily enabling mass production. Useof the proposed more lenient non-inferiority margin, d o, would provide sensitivity to confirming the benefit of such an experimental vaccine when the active com- parator vaccine has efficacy in the range of 50%-80%. Non-inferiority trials, as presented in the scenarios in Tables 1 and 2, often require approximately two- to three-fold the person-years follow-up relative to aplacebo-controlled trial of an experimental vaccine having hypothesized 60% vaccine efficacy. Given this, together with the likelihood that attack rates might bereduced by the impact of available vaccines with ''worthwhile efficacy'' in the regions in which the non- inferiority trial would be conducted, it seems likely thatthe duration of the non-inferiority trial would be 4- 6 months, if not longer. In turn, to properly derive the non-inferiority margin, evidence about the effect of theactive comparator regimen would need to be available over a similar duration. The reliability of non-inferiority trials depends on the validity of the constancy assumption, that is, that the true efficacy of the active comparator vaccine in the setting of the non-inferiority trial will be accuratelyestimated using evidence about its effect from its placebo-controlled trial. Hence, validity of the non- inferiority trial could be influenced by factors thatmight meaningfully alter the efficacy of the active com- parator regimen, such as whether the non-inferiority trial and the placebo-controlled trial that evaluated theactive comparator vaccine are conducted in popula- tions with adequately similar strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus and, as noted above, have similar durations offollow-up. To illustrate how the constancy assumption could be violated in an impactful manner, consider a plausible scenario where an active comparator's effi-cacy is very high over the 2-month interval it was evalu- ated in the placebo-controlled trial, yet meaningfully wanes during the next 4 months. In a non-inferioritytrial following participants over 6 months, if its non- inferiority margin was derived under the false assump- tion that the 2-month level of efficacy of the activecomparator was sustained over 6 months, this violation of the constancy assumption would result in a substan- tial overestimation of the efficacy of the experimentalvaccine. Hence, in potential scenarios considered in this article, a fundamentally important assumption is the duration of follow-up in the non-inferiority trial doesnot exceed the follow-up duration in the placebo- controlled randomized clinical trial that evaluated the active comparator vaccine. The above scenario also makes it clear that, even in placebo-controlled trials that produce short-term 95% vaccine efficacy, 7,8it is important to continue to follow participants in a blinded manner as long as possible. While recent publications have provided strong motiva- tion to do so based on the importance of obtaining reli-able insights about durability of efficacy, long-term safety and effects on severe disease, 5,6,15it is importantFleming et al. 341to recognize that extending the length of blinded follow-up would have the additional positive conse- quence of improving our ability to use such vaccines as active comparators in non-inferiority trials. Placebo-controlled trials are particularly efficient in providing reliable and interpretable evidence about effi- cacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines. They would bea preferred design in settings where countries have lim- ited or no access to licensed vaccines having worthwhile efficacy. 15However, in settings where placebo- controlled trials would no longer be possible due to emerging availability of safe and effective vaccines, non- inferiority trials would be ethically and scientificallyappealing, given the need for multiple safe and effective vaccines. There is considerable need for new vaccines that not only have a particularly favorable safety profileor improved efficacy but also could be administered in a single dose, without cold chain constraints, and with scalability enhancing the ability to enable mass vaccina-tion campaigns. It is likely that non-inferiority trial designs, such as those discussed in this article, soon will be needed to achieve these objectives and, in turn, tosucceed in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic.
