Fall 2011 3< Messages Message froM tHe Dea N In this issue, we celebrate 40 years of WWAMI, our five-state regional medical education program . WWAMI is unique; it is the only public medical school that crosses state lines and, in fact, crosses five state lines . The WWAMI program is characterized by sustained collaboration, partnership and the selfless dedication of countless individuals . The idea for WWAMI began at a meeting of the Washington State Medical Association, with UW faculty and community physicians problem-solving how to increase the number of generalists for the region . In some of the nation's most rural states and at a time of severe physician shortage, the task was daunting . Pres Bratrude, M . D . , an Omak physician, made history with his offer to work with trainees, \"Send them to me; I'll train them . \" This individual commitment expanded into an ambitious multi-state vision and led to an enduring collaboration between academic and community clinicians and researchers, legislators, governors, businesses and communities . Today there are seven first-year university sites, four MEDE x Northwest physician assistant training sites, hundreds of clinical training sites, special programs like WRITE and R/UOP , and return rates substantially above the national average . Importantly, WWAMI remains a top-quality, cost-effective model of collaboration, partnership and dedication . WWAMI is a program we can all be proud of \u2014 thousands of you have played important roles . Please join me in celebrating this remarkable program . Anniversary events will be held throughout the year and in many locations . Thank you for your role in making WWAMI and medical education for the region a wonderful success . Paul G . Ramsey, M . D .

Where pedestrians today see an enormous hole in the ground, in a few years, the site will feature three new state-of-the-art buildings . This expansion heralds future research breakthroughs in medical science . The tenants of the first building being constructed \u2014 research-ers in infectious diseases, immunology, rheumatology and vision science \u2014 will collaborate to solve pressing challenges in medicine when the building opens in 2013 . Joining UW Medicine for the event were Michael K . Young, the University of Washington's new president, and Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn .

The study included more than 200,000 people of European descent, and 346 scientists from more than 200 centers in 24 countries were involved in the project . Their results \u2014 which provide new insight into the biology of blood pressure regulation as well as hope for better treatments in the future \u2014 were published in Nature in September . a ID s drug helps prevent spread of the virus in heterosexual couples The Department of Global Health and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation collaborated on an HIV prevention study in Kenya and Uganda that has resulted in new findings . Participants included more than 4,700 heterosexual couples in which one partner had HIV and the other did not . The trial tested the efficacy of two drugs \u2014 Viread, an antiretroviral drug, and Truvada, a drug previously found to help prevent the spread of HIV to uninfected gay men \u2014 in preventing the spread of HIV from one partner to another . Researchers found that the medications reduced the risk of HIV infection by between 62-73 percent . A similar study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also showed positive results . High-fat diet may injure brain cells Joshua Thaler, M .D ., Ph .D ., an acting instructor in UW Medicine's Diabetes and Obesity Center of Excellence, and his colleagues used mice to study the short- and long-term effects of eating a high-fat diet (similar to a typical U . S . diet) on the brain . They found that the diet caused injury to (and eventual loss of) neurons in the brain that control weight regulation in mice . Thaler and his colleagues suggest that this finding may help explain why it is difficult for obese people to achieve sustained weight loss . Manipulating mosquito populations to reduce the incidence of malaria Scientists fr om Imperial College London and UW Medicine have shown that it is possible to genetically manipulate populations of mosquitoes; in their experiment, genetically altered mosquitoes bred with regular mosquitoes, and, in a few generations, the alteration took root in the population . David Baker, Ph . D . , UW professor of biochemistry and adjunct of Raymond J . Monnat, Jr . , Res . '80, '84, UW professor of pathology and genome sciences, and their trainees were among the researchers credited for the study, published in April in the online version of Nature . The researchers hope they can use genetic manipulation on malaria-bearing mosquitoes to reduce the threat of the disease . According to the World Health Organization, malaria killed nearly one million people in 2008, many of them African children .

UW Medical Center (UWMC) has been named among the nation's best since the rankings began in 1990 . Together, UWMC and Harborview Medical Center programs were ranked among the best hospitals nationally in the follow-ing specialties: rehabilitation medicine (ranked No . 3 in the nation), cancer (No . 6), diabetes and endocrinology (No . 10), nephrology . 11 and UWMC No . 17), ear, nose and throat (No . 12), neurology and neurosurgery (No . 47), (No . 20), gynecology (No . 28), and urology (No . 29) . Several months ago, U.S. News & World Report ranked all four UW Medicine hospitals among the best in the greater Seattle metropolitan area . UWMC and Harborview were ranked No . 1 and No . 2, respectively, and Northwest Hospital & Medical Center and Valley Medical Center were tied at No . 6 with a hospital in Tacoma . eDucat IoN graduation and other transitions On June 4, 2011, UW Medicine celebrat - ed the graduation of the senior medical school class . UW Associate Professor of Family Medicine Raye Maestas, M . D . '83, Res . '86, was asked by the graduating class to give the commencement address . Her talk was filled with stories about the graduates, many from the students' own reflections . Recalling her time as a stu- dent who grew up in rural New Mexico, she noted, \"The goal at the School of Medicine then was to produce the best doctors possible, no matter where you came from . And that is still true today . \" A few days earlier, on May 27, second-year medical students celebrated a mile-stone with the annual Clinical Transition Ceremony \u2014 an event that marks their transition from classroom learning to the clinical phase of their training . \"Take everything you've learned,\" said Res . '84, UW professor of medicine, \"and turn it into something of value for your patients . \"WWa MI educating pas to serve a laska MEDE x Northwest and the University of Alas-ka Anchorage reached an important milestone in August: the graduation of the first UW Medicine physician as-sistant (PA) class in Alaska .

Clinical Transition 2011 Photo: Jennifer Richard, Team Photogenic Fall 2011 7 < feature by Deirdre Schwiesow What takes a nutritional supplement into the realm of medical research? The short answer: a study at the i nstitute of Translational Health Sciences ( i THS), based at the University of Washington. This study, on an herbal product called resveratrol, is only one among many supported by the i THS. The institute gives researchers access to mentoring, training, equipment, pilot funding and clinical study resources \u2014 all in the service of speeding translational medicine. Traditionally, translational medicine was thought of as \"bench-to-bedside\" research, taking a scientific discovery from the investigator's lab, through a clinical trial in human subjects, and then to a patient's hospital room or a doctor's office.

Team Science, Translated8 UW Medicine While this picture is not inaccu- rate, there has been a paradigm shift to a more complex and far-reaching concept of translational medicine. a ccording to UW Medicine's Mary l .

Slattery, Ph. d ., vice dean for research and graduate education, it now encom-passes a broad range of innovations that improve human health, from drug development to healthcare policy. a nd, rather than being conducted by a single, \"lone wolf\" investigator, innovative translational research de-pends on collaboration among diverse, multi-disciplinary teams. \"Translational science is team sci- ence,\" says d isis. \"Training people to work as teams throughout the entire translational process is what we have to do to get new [therapeutic] agents into the clinic faster.\"n ow scientists can go to the i THS to find collaborators who will help them move scientific discoveries to the clinic as rapidly as possible. a part- nership between UW Medicine, Fred Hutchinson c ancer Research c enter, Seattle c hildren's and other groups, the i THS was formed in 2007 and is one of 60 c linical and Translational Science award ( c TS a ) sites nation- wide \u2014 a consortium funded by the n ational i nstitutes of Health ( ni H). d isis is proud of the i THS's impact. \"We've developed a membership of almost 2,000 individuals across the region, and have been able to launch resources that weren't available at the UW before,\" she says.

The team science approach that the i THS fosters is exemplified by its K l 2 Multidisciplinary c linical Re- search c areer d evelopment Program. This ni H-funded program provides up to five years of intensively mentored translational research experience to early-career scientists from all health professions affiliated with the i THS. i n a recent example, current and past K l 2 scholars from a range of disci- plines partnered to study resveratrol, a natural substance found in foods such as blueberries and peanuts, which is Building the team Promoting such teamwork is central to i THS's mission. \" a t each point in the translational pathway, you need a completely dif-ferent set of expertise,\" says d isis, the director of the i THS. \" i f a researcher sees a clinical application for her idea, sometimes she won't know what to do next.

The i THS also has piloted the also promoted as a nutritional supple-ment. Resveratrol is thought to benefit cardiovascular health, but researchers wanted to see if it interacted \u2014 in ways beneficial or otherwise \u2014 with other medications a patient might be taking. Based on experiments performed by Kelsey Hanson, Ph. d ., a recent gradu- ate of the d epartment of Medicinal c hemistry in the UW School of Phar- macy, three K l 2 scholars designed and conducted a pilot study to look at the effect of high daily doses of resveratrol 8 UW MedicineFall 2011 9 on the metabolism of midazolam (a commonly used pre-surgery sedative) in healthy volunteers. \"Our goal was to see if resveratrol actually affects how much midazolam gets into circulation,\" explains co-principal investigator Yvonne l in, Ph. d ., a UW assistant professor of pharmaceutics in the School of Pharmacy. Preliminary results suggest that resveratrol has an effect on drug and pilot funds through a competi-tive review process. What's more, the project provided valuable experience for team members as well as data. \" i t has been a really fantastic train- ing opportunity for me to have access to UW's research resources,\" says Brad-ley. \"The K l 2 program is a significant asset to the School of Medicine, and is helping to create some real experts in multi-disciplinary clinical research.\" \"It has been a really fantastic training opportunity to have access to UW's research resources.\" -Ryan BradleyWith this new study, another researcher has been added to the group of collaborators: Pathmaja (Bobbie) Paramsothy, M. d ., Fel.

You have a land mass that takes up about 27 percent of the United States and contains about eight percent of its people. The terrain varies hugely, often dramatically; it is covered in glaciers, plains, forests, mountains \u2014 even urban sprawl. Some members of its population live in cities, but many live in small, remote communities. How can you possibly deliver adequate medical care to all these people, in all these places? This land mass is the five-state area of Washington, Wyoming, a laska, Montana and i daho (called WW a M i , for short). a nd the answer to the puzzle is the WW a M i program \u2014 a partnership of those five states, the UW School of Medicine, Washing-ton State University (Pullman and Spokane), the University of Wyoming, the University of a laska, Montana State University and the University of i daho. i n 2011, WW a M i commemo- rates its 40th year.The WW a M i program was founded in 1971, a response to a physi-cian shortage and the brainchild of a number of visionary UW Medicine faculty members \u2014 including Jack n . l ein, M. d . '55, M. Roy Schwarz, M. d . '62, Robert Van c itters, M. d . \u2014 and of equally visionary community physicians. i ts objective was, and still is, to train primary-care physicians and other healthcare personnel from the region and for the region, especially in areas with too few physicians. One of the program's novel compo- nents was providing medical education for more than one state; there are no other medical schools that cross state lines. a second was training medi- cal students at their home WW a M i university during their first year. a third novel approach was the WW a M i program's use of community-based educational settings to offer clinical training: sending medical students out, after their classroom sessions, to learn from doctors working in WW a M i communities large and small, rural and urban. \"The WW a M i medical education program is designed to have people go out and train in rural and remote communities so they understand all the benefits \u2014 but also the chal-lenges \u2014 of providing care,\" says Suzanne M. a llen, M. d ., MPH, vice dean for regional affairs. What are the challenges in rural or underserved communities? Balancing work and family, for one. \" i want to be available to my patients and i want to take care of them all the time,\" says Tobe H. Harberd, M. d . '06, a family medicine doctor in c helan, Wash., and the father of two young children.

'72, '74, UW professor in the d epartment of Family Medicine and director of the Rural/Underserved Opportunities Program (R/UOP), was the first resident sent to a WW a M i site outside of Seattle. i n the years that followed, he has seen the WW a M i program grow \u2014 from a handful of training sites in 1974 to more than 165 in 2011. He pinpoints WW a M i 's es-sential sources of strength and growth: the campuses, towns, community doc-tors, UW faculty members, legislatures, trainees and staff who partner together to deliver health care in the places that need it most, whether in Barrow, a town on a laska's northern tip, or an underserved neighborhood in a city like Seattle, Spokane, c heyenne or Missoula. Rosenblatt is amazed at the WW a M i program's progress. \"The va- riety and richness of the program defy Although this photo was taken decades ago in 1976, some things about the WWAMI program haven't changed; it still benefits some very rural and remote areas . WWAMI \u2014 which trains people from the Pacific Northwest to provide healthcare in the five-state region of Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho \u2014 is going strong, 40 years after its inception .

Mc a teer, i utzi, Gardner: all are from rural or remote areas, all are transplants to Seattle (albeit tempo-rarily), and all share a special kind of WW a M i experience. a central characteristic of the WW a M i program is the relationship between the UW School of Medicine and other academic institutions in the five-state region. While some students spend their first two years of medical school at the University of Washing-ton in Seattle, others spend their first year at their WW a M i state univer- sity and their second year in Seattle. i n their third and fourth years, all students travel to sites throughout the WW a M i region \u2014 in Seattle and out- side it \u2014 to complete medical clerk-ships: hands-on training with patients, supervised by doctors. The logic behind this educational plan is simple. WW a M i educators want students from those first-year WW a M i sites to return to their home states to practice medicine. The need for doctors in WW a M i \u2014 a largely rural area underserved by medical prac-titioners \u2014 is high. ( i n fact, according to the a ssociation of a merican Medi- cal c olleges, four out of five WW a M i states have fewer physicians than the national average: 254 doctors for every 100,000 people.) Students find the first year in their home state helpful, even wonderful. One huge advantage, says Mc a teer, is getting to know the 20-some students in the local class. e ven after you move to Seattle, he says, \"you always have something in common with students from your first year.\" That kind of camaraderie is reas- suring when finding your way in a new place. i utzi remembers half of her a laska class gathering at the Port of Seattle to unload the shipping contain-er they'd rented to move their belong-ings. \" i t was like a small community in the late 1800s, packing up everything into their covered wagons and moving to a new town,\" she says. Still, the transition from the home state's site to the Seattle site can be a challenge. The student-teacher ratio is vastly different (each second-year class has 220 students), and you have to learn the ropes all over again. But the School of Medicine steps in to help students from regional sites adjust. \"The best thing [the School] did was build the c ollege Program,\" says Gardner. i n the c olleges, students are assigned to small groups under the guidance of a mentor; they get to know that mentor from day one of medical school, no matter what their location. d uring the second year, they work closely with their mentor, learn-ing clinical skills at the bedside and in small-group settings. a nd during medical students' third and fourth WW a MI tur ns 40 > Photo courtesy of KayCee Gardner Medical student KayCee Gardner comes from ranch country in Montana .

But at one point, this self-described \"Seattle-centric\" medical student was reluctant to leave the Seattle campus. Would she learn as much about medicine outside of the city as she had in it?Then came her obstetrics- gynecology rotation in a nchorage, a laska. \" i absolutely loved it,\" says c arvalho. Ob-gyn was followed by oth- er rotations \u2014 including pulmonary medicine \u2014 in Boise, i daho. \"Then i really got hooked,\" she says. Today, c arvalho designs innova- tive learning experiences for first- and second-year residents, third- and fourth-year medical students and trainees completing advanced pulmo-nary fellowships, among others. For example, she started a critical-care medicine curriculum a few years ago for medical students, one that prepares them for starting an internship. c arvalho also works directly with UW Medicine faculty like Brian Ross, M. d . '83, Res. '87, UW professor in the d epartment of a nesthesiology & Pain Medicine, to teach trainees. Boise is a satellite site for the UW Medicine-based i nstitute for Simulation and i nterprofessional Studies ( i S i S), which uses sophisticated mannequins and computer models to offer medical training. Using such simulation exer-cises allows trainees to hone specific skills, like placing a central line for long-term intravenous drug therapy, doing a lumbar puncture, or caring for patients receiving mechanical ventilation. The trainees appreciate these programs, c arvalho says. l ast year, the fourth-year students (who are a little anxious when they arrive), wrote her a thank-you card. \"We're no longer afraid to be interns,\" it said. Big investment, big reward i f medical students benefit from the WW a M i program, says Urata, so do the states that participate in the partnership. With WW a M i , a laska can help its citizens become doctors, and, he says, \"we get to take advantage of one of the best primary-care medical schools in the U.S.\" \"We really want to teach our trainees how to teach, because we think that's going to be the name of the game,\" says Paula G .

When she participated in the WRITE program in Montana, she found that the local hospital would benefit from using it . She subsequently had the process approved for use by the medical board in Lewistown, Mont . p overty. \"Often, you don't see [poor] patients until their problems are really large,\" says Iutzi . She found this to be true both at Harborview Medical Center, which provides the most charity care in Washington state, and at clinics in Nicaragua, where she volunteers . What's in it for the preceptors themselves, besides a significant ad- dition to their workload? They love working with young people who are so enthused about medicine. a nd it reinforces a commitment to lifelong learning. \"Working with trainees definitely keeps me on my toes,\" says Harberd. c ommunity doctors have to be prepared to answer trainees' many questions \u2014 and they have to be pre-pared to teach. \" i t's fun to continue to learn, and i think that's the key when you're teaching students,\" says Urata. a nd, like all good teachers, he knows that learning is a balance between watching and doing.

With a recent gift to UW Medicine and with other advocacy efforts, Spokane community members Mari and David Clack are proving Roberts right. The Clacks are key members of an educational movement involving partnership and innovation at the personal level and be- tween the University of Washington (UW) and Washington State University (WSU). The story \u2014 and the Clacks' gift \u2014 begins with medical students from the state of Washington who are enrolled in the WWAMI Spokane program. In the 1970s, the UW School of Medicine began work with other North- west educational institutions, politicians and community members to educate students who would stay in the Pacific Northwest to practice medicine. The pro- gram \u2014 which would eventually involve Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho \u2014 became known as WWAMI. Although Spokane had been part of WWAMI for many years through training third- and fourth-year students during their clinical phase, it wasn't until 2008 that a cohort of first-year medical students began to train on the WSU- Spokane (Riverpoint) campus. These students joined similar WWAMI cohorts already established in other states and on the WSU-Pullman campus. Given the Clacks' extensive experience in business and community advocacy, they began to explore the vast potential in this UW-WSU collaboration. The Clacks have one major goal in mind: training doctors to practice in Eastern Washington, where doctors are very much needed. In training doctors, explains Roberts, there's a certain domino effect. It begins in the first year of medical school. \"We want students to see that Spo- kane is a great community, so we want to expose them to local doctors and to community-oriented social events in that first year,\" Roberts says. \"If they have a good experience, they're more likely to re- turn for clinical training during their third and fourth years. If they do that, they're much more likely to consider completing their residency training here. And doctors tend to settle and practice near their residency site.\" The Great Collaboration Social events help first-year students feel at home in Spokane, and that's where the Clacks have focused their giving. \"It's a very modest beginning, but you have to start somewhere,\" says David Clack. Encouraging community engagement in the WWAMI program itself is the Clacks' next step. \"We've found that when we get people out to the campus and they walk around, and we show them what's happening, they get really excited,\" says Mari Clack, a former University of Wash- ington regent. The excitement will likely build as the UW and WSU work together on a new piece of the WWAMI program: a pilot project that would test the feasibility of teaching second-year students at the Spokane site. To date, student training has only been offered in the first year and during the clinical training phase in the third and fourth years \u2014 and all medical students spend their second year in Se-attle. But a pilot could place all four years of the WWAMI program in Spokane. \"I'm a believer in collaboration,\" Mari says. When it comes to medical care for the WWAMI region, she adds, \"we're all in this together.\" See page 10 for more stories on the WWAMI program. In making a gift to support the future of medical care in Eastern Washington, Spokane residents Mari and David Clack (far left) are also paying tribute to Mari's father, Clyde Jensen, M.D., a patholo-gist at Harborview who cared deeply about medical education.Right photo courtesy of WSU-Spokane \" Left photo: J. Craig Sweat Photographyiv UW Medicine Report to Donors 2010-2011REPORT TO DONORS Learning to Fly Hard work, long hours, years of ex- pensive training \u2014 that's the life of a medical student. On top of that, imagine raising several children. Susan S. Hucka- bay and her late husband, Durward A. (\"Huck\") Huckabay, Jr., didn't have to use much imagination to picture that scenar - io. It is part of their family history. Huck's father, Durward A. Hucka- bay, was in medical school in the early 1900s when his parents died, leaving him responsible for his orphaned siblings. He and his wife took them in. \"That was truly a fiscal hardship,\" says Susan S. Huckabay. It's a story that Anthony Guynes, a 36-year-old, second-year medical student and father of three \u2014 and a recipient of the Durward A. Huckabay, M.D. Endowed Scholarship Fund \u2014 can relate to. For Guynes, going to medical school is an all-family commitment, and a costly one. Without the scholarship the Huckabays created a number of years ago, Guynes says, he'd graduate with more than $300,000 in debt. \"It really makes a difference to have other people helping us,\" he says. In 2011, the Huckabays made another gift to scholarship: a $1 million challenge gift, established to encourage others to contribute through matching contribu-tions. Over the past few months, a number of people have stepped forward. Ann Ramsay-Jenkins, chair of UW Medicine's Scholarship and Student Sup-port Committee, vice chair of the College Success Foundation's board of directors, and past chair of the UW Medicine Board, was among the first to meet the chal- lenge. With her late husband, William (Bill) Jenkins, she has been a longtime supporter of medical-student scholarships at the UW School of Medicine. \"Bill and I have always believed in giv- ing a hand up, particularly to bright young people with big dreams,\" Jenkins says. She is also interested in freeing students from crushing loan debt. Such debt may steer students away from practicing primary care, especially in rural and underserved areas where doctors are very much needed. Ruth Fischer-Wright, M.D. '87, Res. '90, has similar thoughts about medi-cal practice. \"You can make more money in other specialties, but primary care is invaluable to our communities,\" she says. When Fischer-Wright and her hus- band, Craig L. Wright, M.D. '88, Res. '91, made a commitment to the Huckabay challenge, they opted to support third-year students interested in primary care. Their gift is motivated partially by empa-thy. As medical students, the couple lived from loan check to loan check, and they vividly recall how quickly money dwindled after paying for books and rent. \"That was one of the things that attracted us \u2014 providing medical students with a little money during their training, rather than living on loans,\" says Craig Wright. Wright and Fischer-Wright look for - ward to learning more about the students who will receive their scholarship \u2014 just the sort of contact that Susan Huckabay has enjoyed. Every year, she and her family see many inspiring letters from students who benefit from the Huckabay Scholarship. \"I have every single letter that I have ever received,\" Huckabay says. A thank-you letter from a grateful Anthony Guynes is certainly in the file. \"Having people like the Huckabays, who are willing to share the burden with us \u2014 and just knowing that there are people invested in my education and my family's well-being \u2014 it's really a motivation and an encouragement,\" says Guynes.Sharing the Medical-school ChallengeScholarship recipient Anthony Guynes, a former pastor, says that medical school is a family affair \u2014 and he and the kids are having fun learning about medicine together. Pictured (at far left) are Guynes' wife, Beth, a public health nurse, Quinnson (8 weeks), Shaylah (5), Josiah (7), and Guynes.

There's an eagle, a great blue heron, and baby swallows crowded into a nest, their beaks open for food. Fausto, an accomplished amateur photographer, was also the chair of the University of Washington School of Medi-cine's Department of Pathology for 17 years. He is one of a handful of people at the top of his field: liver pathology. \"It's hard to know what superlative to use,\" says Thomas J. Montine, M.D., UW professor in the Department of Pathology, the department's interim chair, and the Nancy and Buster Alvord En- dowed Chair in Neuropathology. \"He's a world-class liver researcher.\" Fausto has spent his entire career studying the liver's ability to regenerate \u2014 remarkably, a property it retains even after two-thirds of the liver's tissue is removed. \"Nelson thought, quite correctly, that this unusual property of the liver to regener - ate itself \u2014 and then stop \u2014 would hold important clues to cell cycle regulation and what goes wrong in some forms of cancer,\" says Montine. This important research is an area of deep commitment for Fausto and his wife, Ann L. DeLancey, Ph.D. That's why they established the Pathology Liver Research Fund earlier this year. \"The creation of a fund will allow this kind of work to continue,\" Fausto says. Faculty mentoring is another area of immense importance to Fausto and DeLancey. To move faculty mentorship forward, they created a recruitment and retention fund to foster the development of junior faculty. \"We toss around the word 'mentor' a lot now, to the point that it's almost trivial,\" says Montine. But Nelson, he says, is the real thing: a genuine mentor. Barb Prentiss, the Department of Pathology's director and administrator, agrees. She worked with Fausto for 16 years, watching him build the department to prominence, bringing in international scholars, and, most importantly, chang-ing people's lives \u2014 including her own, Montine's and those of many colleagues. \"He has been truly instrumental in sup-porting me and many others in building our careers,\" she says. Fausto and DeLancey are also chang- ing the lives of Native American and Alaskan Native youth \u2014 an interest spurred, in part, by their devotion to collecting Native art. While the art gives them a great deal of pleasure, says Fausto, it also has inspired them to action.\"We thought of the difficult condi- tions that people endure in living on reservations, in Alaskan villages, and other places,\" Fausto says. Wanting to help, he and DeLancey chose to contrib-ute to an endowed scholarship for medi-cal students from federally recognized tribes. They also contributed to a project that brings middle-school children from Washington tribes to visit the Department of Pathology. \"We want to help these young people see that there are broad horizons they can explore if they remain in school,\" says Fausto. The kids stay overnight to see the labs, talk to researchers, look under mi- croscopes and learn about diseases. \"They get very, very excited,\" says Prentiss. Middle-school students, researchers, administrators, medical students, colleagues \u2014 Fausto has a gift for provid- ing help when and where people need it most. \"He's the kind of leader who lets you spread your own wings and learn to fly,\" says Prentiss. \"And he's there supporting you as you do it. \" Learning to Fly World-renowned liver pathologist Nelson Fausto, M.D., and his wife, psychologist Ann DeLancey, Ph.D., believe in helping people achieve their dreams. This belief inspires their generosity to medical research, faculty, and Native American and Alaska Native youth. Photo: David Wentworth Photography vi UW Medicine Report to Donors 2010-2011REPORT TO DONORS A Valuable Life From the beginning, I knew my fel- lowship was going to be very differ - ent from my residency,\" says Robert J. Champer, M.D., Ph.D., Fel. '95. Champer completed his ophthalmology fellowship at UW Medicine; he worked with Robert E. Kalina, M.D., former chair of the De- partment of Ophthalmology. \"It was an absolutely wonderful ex- perience,\" says Champer. \"He would be one-on-one with you in the clinic and in the operating room. Technically, he taught me how to be a first-rate clinician and surgeon. But more than that, he taught me how to be a doctor \u2014 how to listen to patients, how to comfort them.\" Champer, a retina specialist who practices in Eugene, Ore., is not the only physician impressed by Kalina's mentor - ship style. At an alumni event in 2009, Champer and others Kalina trained began talking about \"what a role model he was, and how we needed to acknowledge that.\" From those conversations, which included Elaine Chuang, M.D., Res. '83, Samuel G. Farmer, M.D. '79, Res. '84, and Debra Graham, M.D., Res. '96, among others, the idea for an endowed profes-sorship honoring Kalina was born. The Robert E. Kalina, M.D., Endowed Professorship for Ophthalmology Educa-tion is one of the few professorships at UW Medicine specifically designed to pro-mote teaching. Kalina, who still teaches, is grateful for this focus. He believes that, when it comes to funding for the \"three- legged stool\" of research, education and patient care, the teaching component can get short shrift. \"At the same time, there have been increased responsibilities placed on people who run training programs,\" Kalina says. \"There's competition be-tween teaching, which doesn't gener - ate revenue, and earning your own way with patient care.\" Kalina hopes that the professorship \u2014 which will serve as one stable, reliable source of funding \u2014 will help rectify that imbalance by supporting a faculty member focused on teaching and training. Russell N. Van Gelder, M.D., Ph.D., chair of the Department of Ophthalmol- ogy and the Boyd K. Bucey Memorial Endowed Chair in Ophthalmology, con-curs. \"The stresses on education funding have made this kind of philanthropy essential to continuing our mission,\" he says. Van Gelder observes that the profes- sorship is more than an asset to the department. It is also a wonderful tribute to Kalina, a member of the department for 44 years: 27 as chair, 26 as director of the residency program, and 15 as director of the vitreoretinal fellowship program. \"He set outstanding educational standards for our training, particularly our residency training, which persist to this day,\" says Van Gelder. Kalina demurs, saying that \"the most important ingredient in teaching is the student.\" But it is clear from the outpour - ing of support for the professorship that Kalina has had an extraordinary impact on his trainees and peers. The many donors who have pledged to fund the professorship include a number of Kalina's colleagues, 60 former trainees and a generous anonymous donor. \"The No. 1 thing is to acknowledge the effect that this man has had on tens of thousands of patients,\" says Champer. \"But I'm also hoping that this funding will attract another person like Dr. Kalina, who can take up that mantle and go forward with it.\" Professor Emeritus Robert E. Kalina, M.D., and chief ophthalmology resident Sharel Ongchin, M.D., study images of a patient's choroidal melanoma. Recognizing his many contributions to education at UW Medicine, a number of Kalina's peers and trainees have created a professorship in his name. Taking Up the Mantle \" Photos: David Wentworth Photography UW Medicine Report to Donors 2010-2011 viiREPORT TO DONORS Every year, more than 12,000 people in the United States suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI). And in one instant, their lives are forever changed. Severe SCI can cause temporary or permanent paralysis, and appropriate rehabilitative care is often part of the treatment for injured patients. After that, however, making the transition from hospital-based care to daily life at home, at work and in the community can be a very hard road. UW Medicine's SCI Rehabilitation Core Group had ambitious, innovative ideas for a post-rehabilitative care program for people with SCI, says Maria R. (Rina) Reyes, M.D., Res. '94, UW assistant professor in the Department of Rehabilita-tion Medicine and medical director of the UW Medicine SCI Rehabilitation Program, \"but we didn't have any funding to make it happen.\" Enter several generous supporters. The Craig H. Neilsen Foundation awarded a competitive grant in support of the proposed program. And, after winning a personal injury settlement for Kenneth (Kenny) Salvini \u2014 a young man rendered quadriplegic after a terrible accident at a ski resort \u2014 attorneys John R. Connelly, Jr., and James W. Beck committed to a matching gift in Salvini's honor. The gifts were made through their firms, Connelly Law Offices and Gordon Thomas Honey- well, LLP , respectively. \"Kenny is an extraordinary young man, and we wanted to do something on his behalf that would help other people in the same circumstances realize that they could go on and lead a valuable life,\" says Connelly. \"He has such an unusually supportive network of family,\" Beck adds. \"It made a lot of sense for us to do something that would acknowledge all the people out there that don't have the same support network that Kenny has.\" These gifts allowed the launch of UW Medicine's Transitions Health Maintenance and Wellness Program (\"Transitions\") in February 2011. Transitions gives patients access to post-rehabilitative services dur - ing their first two years after injury \u2014 a critical time for maintaining and building on the level of activity set during in-hospital rehabilitation. Without post-reha- bilitation services, activity typically drops precipitously after a patient is discharged. \"Transitions promotes lifelong well- ness, independence and participation by introducing and encouraging healthful practices,\" explains Reyes, who directs the program and witnesses firsthand the progress made by its participants. The individualized program \u2014 with activities taking place at UW Medical Center and Harborview Medical Center \u2014 includes an educational series on health and pain-management strate-gies as well as counseling services. It also provides opportunities for patients to participate in supervised, adapted exer - cise, join community recreation programs, master adapted driving skills, and use computers to explore work options. These resources are invaluable for patients strug- gling to create a new \"normal\" after SCI. Ray Neilsen, chair of the Craig H. Neilsen Foundation, says that Transitions' goals align strongly with the foundation's mission. \"The Craig H. Neilsen Foundation supports research to find a cure for spinal cord injuries and programs to improve the quality of life for those living with SCI,\" says Neilsen. \"We're pleased to partner with the University of Washington in launching its innovative rehabilitation program, Transitions. We believe this pro-gram will offer wonderful opportunities for those living with SCI.\" One patient who appreciates these op- portunities is Joseph Preti, paralyzed from the chest down after an accident in Octo- ber 2010. Thanks to Transitions, Preti has learned to drive with hand controls, and he now drives himself from Port Angeles to Seattle twice a week for his sessions. Although his wife still needs to help with the wheelchair restraints, being able to drive gives him a feeling of independence, he says. \"It's a real benefit to me.\" Maria R. Reyes, M.D., Res. '94, and volunteer Kyle Samek assist Joseph Preti in building upper-body strength. \"I've definitely gotten stronger,\" Preti, says Reyes, UW Medicine's new post-spinal cord injury rehabilitation program, Transi-tions, helps ease the shift back into family and community life. A Valuable LifePhotos: David Wentworth Photography Taking Up the Mantle viii UW Medicine Report to Donors 2010-2011REPORT TO DONORS www.supportuwmedicine.orgSome people are drawn to innova- tion. When those people are donors to scientific research, they can advance significant medical breakthroughs that might otherwise take many more years to achieve. John L. (Larry) and Eileen Tietze are such donors. Through the John H. Tietze Foundation Trust, they have made a series of awards to UW Medicine scientists for breakthrough and early-career research on the leading edge of translational medicine. These awards may ultimately lead to grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). \"Working with early-career scientists has proved to be the most rewarding investment we have ever made,\" Eileen Tietze says. \"Our gifts help move science forward.\" While the Tietzes give grants in several research areas, including brain tumors and vision, many current recipients of their awards are conducting stem cell research. Eileen Tietze, who serves as a public member on the UW Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight (ESCRO) Committee, sees stem cell research as the next big frontier in medicine. \"The idea is to get scientists with great ideas to the next step, where they can go to the NIH for funding,\" she says. Perkins Coie is another significant donor drawn to early-stage research at UW Medicine; the prestigious law firm supports scientists working on promising therapies. \"Perkins Coie has a longstanding inter - est in the life sciences. We are proud that our Award for Discovery, now in its fifth year, provides support for cutting-edge research at UW Medicine's South Lake Union campus,\" says Jim Lisbakken, a partner in the firm's Licensing and Tech-nology Practice and co-chair of the firm's Life Sciences Practice. \"The need to fund early-stage translational research is ongo-ing, and we congratulate and thank Larry and Eileen Tietze for supporting break-through research at UW Medicine through the Tietze Foundation.\" The contributions from Perkins Coie and the Tietzes are making a significant difference. Michael T. Chin, M.D., Ph.D., FACC, FAHA, UW associate professor of medicine in the Division of Cardiology and the Harold T. Dodge/John L. Locke En-dowed Chair of Cardiovascular Medicine, is the first recipient of the Tietze Family Award for Research in Stem Cells. \"Gifts like the Tietze Award are invaluable. They allow us to fund innova- tive but high-risk projects that wouldn't be funded by the NIH,\" Chin says. The funds he received from the Tietzes support the development of a protein-based cell therapy to convert fibroblast stem cells into heart cells in order to repair injured hearts. In contrast to embryonic stem cells, fibroblast cells are located throughout the body and are easy to obtain. Chin is testing four proteins with the potential to convert fibroblasts into cardiac cells at the site of injury. What would success mean? \"It could revolutionize treatment for people who have had heart attacks and ischemic heart disease,\" he says. But even if this particular project doesn't achieve the hoped-for results, the Tietzes will still be satisfied. \"We have never been disappointed,\" Tietze says of their giving. \"Science looks for answers, but they're not always found. Our grants help the search.\" Michael T. Chin, M.D., Ph.D., FACC, FAHA, pictured here in his lab, studies ways in which non-embryonic stem cells might be used to repair the heart. Chin's work is supported by Larry and Eileen Tietze; similar work at UW Medicine \u2014 innovative, early-stage research \u2014 is also supported by Perkins Coie. Looking for AnswersPhotos: David Wentworth Photography Fall 2011 19 < feature It was a proud moment for Pat Hensch, P a - c (Seattle c lass 19). On a ug. 18, 2011, Hensch \u2014 a M ede X n orthwest faculty member, lecturer and clinical coor- dinator, witnessed the graduation of the 15 members of M ede X a laska's first class of physician assistants (P a s). Hensch knows a laska, especially the challenges of remote medicine. a fter she moved to Bethel in 1983, she enrolled in the M ede X program, returning to the town for clinical training. She then worked in Bethel \u2014 considered \"bush\" a laska \u2014 for 17 years. e ven at her a nchorage office today, says Hensch, \" i might see a moose as i look out the window.\" Knowing how P a s fit in to the world of rural and re- mote medicine is useful to Hensch, who sets up rotations for students in sites like Kodiak, Tok, d enali and Juneau. The students spend their first year studying in a nchor- age at the University of a laska \u2014 where the new health sciences building brings together P a students, WW a M i medical students and nursing students. They spend their second year traveling from rotation to rotation, learning from community practitioners who teach them hands-on work in family medicine, behavioral health, general surgery and emergency medicine. Making connections with medical providers takes a lot of travel. There are very few roads in this last, vast frontier, but Hensch recently completed a \"1,000-mile journey\" to inspect sites; in winter, she flies. d uring in- spections, Hensch verifies that a clinic has the resources to take on a student as well as a patient population that will show the student a variety of needs. a ll the sites Pat Hensch, PA-C (Seattle Class 19), once used milk jugs to pull a patient's dislocated shoulder back into place .

D . program in rehabilitation science at UW Medicine . Fall 2011 33< student Voices These are Annie K. McCabe's top three backpacking tips: Bring good shoes. Remember your water filter. Pack extra underwear. Mc c abe, M. d . '11, had plenty of time to consider these tips. a s an undergraduate at the University of Washington (UW), she applied for a Bonderman Travel Fellowship to observe the practice of medicine in Vietnam, Malaysia, c ambodia, l aos and Thailand. By the time she set out on her trip, Mc c abe already knew that she wanted to become a doctor. The Spokane, Wash., native had come west to Seattle Pacific University (SPU) on an athletic scholarship, but she found herself more interested in her studies than in cross-country \u2014 in fact, she helped her teammates with their science classes. Then, she says, she had an epiphany. a lthough she loved SPU, Mc c abe decided to transfer to the UW . \" i want to learn science big-time,\" she thought, \"and i want to get into medicine, and i want to be a part of research.\" i t was during her undergraduate studies in neurobiology at the UW that she heard about the Bonderman Fellowship. Her first reaction to the program \u2014 which underwrites a year's worth of travel and exploration \u2014 was one of incredulity. But she set out, armed with curiosity, goodwill and, of course, her backpack. \"The fellowship is really supposed to make you stop and experience the world and re- think your position on things,\" she says. a nd her travels in a sia, she says, were eye-opening. Mc- c abe observed hos- pitals. She hiked. She volunteered in Thailand after the 2004 tsuna- mi, providing water and first aid to soldiers whose job it was to identify the dead. a nd Mc c abe found herself grateful for the op- portunities her own culture afforded, es- pecially for women. \"[The trip] made me really motivated to be aware of women's rights...and to foster independence and self-worth in kids,\" she says.
