The lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, thymus gland, and tonsils all play a role, as do lymphocytes (specialized white blood cells), antibodies, and interferon. Two types of immunity protect the body: innate and adaptive. Innate immunity is present at birth and provides the first barrier against microorganisms. The skin, mucus secretions, and the acidity of the stomach are examples of innate immunity that act as barriers to keep unwanted germs away from more vulnerable tissues. Adaptive immunity is the second barrier to infection. It is acquired later in life, such as after an immunization or successfully fighting off an [infection](/medical-topics/id/hn-1038000#hn-1038000-need-to-know). The adaptive immune system retains a memory of all the invaders it has faced. This is why people usually get the measles only once, although they may be repeatedly exposed to the disease. Unfortunately some bugs\u2014such as the viruses that cause the [common cold](/medical-topics/id/hn-1192004#hn-1192004-need-to-know)\u2014\"disguise\" themselves and must be fought off time and again by the immune system. Symptoms Symptoms of decreased immune function include frequent [colds](/medical-topics/id/hn-1192004#hn-1192004-need-to-know) and [flus](/medical-topics/id/hn-1221006#hn-1221006-need-to-know), recurring [parasitic infections](/medical-topics/id/hn-1243003#hn-1243003-need-to-know), initially mild infections that become serious, opportunistic infections (infections by organisms that are usually well controlled by a healthy immune system, such as toxoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, and cytomegalovirus), and cancer. Healthy Lifestyle Tips Both excessive thinness and severe [obesity](/medical-topics/id/hn-1054002#hn-1054002-need-to-know) are associated with impaired immune responses.1 Obesity increases the risk of [infection](/medical-topics/id/hn-1038000#hn-1038000-need-to-know), at least in hospitalized patients, according to preliminary research.2 However, these effects may not occur with mild to moderate obesity in otherwise healthy people, and attempts to lose weight through dietary restriction may actually be harmful to the immune system.3 The detrimental effects of both appear to be offset when people regularly perform aerobic exercise.4, 5 The effects of exercise on immune function depend on many factors, including frequency and intensity of exercise.6 Regular moderate physical activity has positive effects, at least on some measures of immunity, and has been shown to reduce risk of upper respiratory infection. However, very intense and prolonged exercise, such as running a marathon or overtraining, can, in the short term, actually increase the risk of developing infections.7 The positive effects of moderate exercise on immunity may also partly explain the apparent reduced susceptibility to cancer of physically active people.8 Holistic Options The immune system is suppressed during times of stress. Chronic mental and emotional stress can reduce immune function, but whether this effect is sufficient to increase the risk of [infection](/medical-topics/id/hn-1038000#hn-1038000-need-to-know) or cancer is less clear.9, 10 Nevertheless, immune function has been increased by stress-reducing techniques such as relaxation exercises, [biofeedback](/medical-topics/id/hn-2939007#hn-2939007-001), and other approaches,11, 12 although not all studies have shown a significant effect.13 [] Eating Right The right diet is the key to managing many diseases and to improving general quality of life. For this condition, scientific research has found benefit in the following healthy eating tips. |Recommendation||Why| |Choose fats wisely|| | Opt for monounsaturated fats, such as olive oil, over other kinds of fats to ensure optimal immune function. The effect of fats on the immune system is complex and only partially understood. Excessive intake of total dietary fat impairs immune response, but some types of fat may be neutral or even beneficial. For example, monounsaturated fats, as found in olive oil, appear to have no detrimental effect on the immune system in humans at reasonable dietary levels. Research on the effect of the omega-3 fatty acids that are abundant in some fish, Supplementation with As with omega-3 fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids (as found in vegetable oils) have also produced conflicting effects on the immune system. Enriching a low-fat diet with omega-6 fatty acids did not impair immunity. However, diets high in omega-6 fatty acids have suppressed immunity in other reports. In summary, low-fat diets with moderate levels of monounsaturated fat from olive oil appear least likely to compromise immune function and may provide small benefits. Conclusions about the desirability of diets high in either omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acid supplementation await further research. |Cut down on sugar|| | All forms of sugar (including honey) interfere with white blood cells' ability to destroy bacteria, so cutting back is one way to give your immune system a boost. All forms of sugar (including honey) interfere with the ability of white blood cells to destroy bacteria. Animal studies suggest diets high in sucrose (table sugar) impair some aspects of immune function. The importance of these effects in the prevention of infections in humans remains unclear. |Give yogurt a go|| | Many studies have shown immune-stimulating effects from yogurt that contains live cultures, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and other friendly bacteria (probiotics). Many studies, in both animals and humans, have demonstrated immune-stimulating effects from yogurt which contains live cultures, such as |Avoid alcohol binges|| | Limit alcohol intake to avoid damaging effects to your immune system. Alcohol intake, including single episodes of moderate consumption, interferes with a wide variety of immune defenses. Alcohol's immune-suppressive effect may be one mechanism for the association between alcohol intake and certain cancers and [] Supplements [What Are Star Ratings?](#HwStarRatingExplanationWrapper) Our proprietary \"Star-Rating\" system was developed to help you easily understand the amount of scientific support behind each supplement in relation to a specific health condition. While there is no way to predict whether a vitamin, mineral, or herb will successfully treat or prevent associated health conditions, our unique ratings tell you how well these supplements are understood by some in the medical community, and whether studies have found them to be effective for other people. For over a decade, our team has combed through thousands of research articles published in reputable journals. To help you make educated decisions, and to better understand controversial or confusing supplements, our medical experts have digested the science into these three easy-to-follow ratings. We hope this provides you with a helpful resource to make informed decisions towards your health and well-being. 3 Stars Reliable and relatively consistent scientific data showing a substantial health benefit. 2 Stars Contradictory, insufficient, or preliminary studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit. 1 Star For an herb, supported by traditional use but minimal or no scientific evidence.
