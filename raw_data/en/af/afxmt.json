Name of patient Signature of patient Date (dd/mm/yy) Name of parent/guardian Signature of parent/guardian Date (dd/mm/yy) Reviewed by Qualifications Date (dd/mm/yy)If applicable Form reviewed and risk assessment carried out by3Why are these questions important? How old you are Babies There is a greater risk of yellow fever vaccine related brain inflammation (encephalitis) in very young babies. Babies aged less than six months should not have yellow fever vaccine and babies aged six to nine months should only be given this vaccine if the risk of yellow fever at the destination to be visited is high, such as during epidemics/ outbreaks, and travel is unavoidable. Aged 60 years or older You are at increased risk of developing serious side effects from the vaccine compared to younger travellers. If you are travelling to areas where yellow fever vaccine is 'generally not recommended' you should not receive vaccine. Further information is available in the NaTHNaC Yellow Fever Information Leaflet for Travellers and on the FitForTravel Yellow Fever Vaccine page . How you are feeling today Minor illness without high temperature (fever) should not usually delay your yellow fever vaccination. However, vaccination may be postponed until you have fully recovered. This is to make sure any symptoms are not confused with possible reactions to the vaccine. Your allergies and previous reactions to yellow fever vaccine This vaccine may contain traces of egg, chicken protein and other ingredients that some people are occasionally allergic to. If you have ever had a serious reaction (anaphylaxis) to any of the vaccine ingredients, you must tell your health professional; you will not usually be able to receive yellow fever vaccine. Your general health and any condition or treatment that may affect your immune system This vaccine contains live yellow fever virus that has been weakened. Your response to the vaccine may not be so good if your immune system is weakened by certain illnesses or treatments, but occasionally the vaccine can still be given. However, if your immune system is very weak you must not receive yellow fever vaccine as you are at risk of developing serious side effects from the vaccine, including death. 4If you have ever been told that you may have a problem with your thymus gland (includes myasthenia gravis or a thymoma), or if you ever had open chest surgery The thymus gland is part of your immune system and sometimes does not work properly or has been removed (thymectomy). Myasthenia gravis is a disease that may involve your thymus gland. If you have a history of any of these conditions, you must not receive yellow fever vaccine as you are at risk of developing serious side effects, including death. The thymus gland may be removed during chest surgery. Yellow fever vaccine can still be given in some instances following chest surgery. If you are planning a pregnancy, pregnant now or breast-feeding If you are planning a pregnancy, it is recommended to wait until 28 days after yellow fever vaccination before getting pregnant (conceiving). Safety of yellow fever vaccine during pregnancy is not clear, although increased complications for mother or baby have not been reported when the vaccine was given during pregnancy. Discussion with a health professional about the risks and benefits of this vaccine during pregnancy will help you decide whether yellow fever vaccination is right for you at this time. You are encouraged to continue breast-feeding during your trip. Several very young (less than two months old) breast-fed babies developed brain inflammation shortly after their mothers' yellow fever vaccination. Discuss with a health professional whether the risk of yellow fever at your travel destination is sufficiently high for yellow fever vaccination to be recommended. If you have a first-degree family member who has had a serious adverse reaction to yellow fever vaccine If such a reaction was not due to a known medical risk factor, it is possible that you may be susceptible to developing a serious adverse reaction due to an unidentified genetic reason. ! If you cannot have the yellow fever vaccination, and travel to areas where yellow fever occurs cannot be avoided, you still need advice about yellow fever certificate requirements and how to avoid mosquito bites.
