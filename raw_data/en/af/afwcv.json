All samples initially tested at other than state- federal laboratories shall be submitted (mailed) within 48 hours of collection and confirmed at the state- federal laboratory. (3) When a discrepancy occurs between test results of the stat e-federal laboratory and those of the person who originally tested the animal(s), the entire consignment, shipment, or herd will be traced and held pending results of a retest on the animal(s) with the discrepancy. (4) Samples for all retest purposes will be collected by accredited veterinarians that are approved by the Commission to perform brucellosis program duties, or by commission or APHIS personnel and submitted to the state- federal laboratory for confirmation testing. An epidemiologist may designate those cattle that do not require a test. The herd of origin, as well as the herd in which the animal(s) is presently located, will be affected by the test results of the state- federal laboratory. The state- federal laboratory initial test results will prev ail if the traced animal cannot be positively identified or if it has been slaughtered and cannot be retested. (5) When the state- federal laboratory is unable to confirm results of a test because of insufficient serum, hemolyzed blood, or broken tubes, th e commission may require a trace and retest of the animals not confirmed. (6) When the commission has reason to believe the tests are controversial, contested, or disputed, it may require that its personnel be present at the time of blood collection and t esting as a basis for compliance with these regulations. In such case, the commission shall notify the herd owner prior to the test. (b) Classification of cattle.

The following serological tests may be used for the classification of cattle. (1) Card test. The card test (buffered Brucella is a test antigen) t hat may be used to classify cattle as suspects. Results of the card test may be used with other test results conducted in the state- federal laboratory to aid in the classification of 15 | Page cattle as reactors. The card test may be used as a test to classify cattle as reactors on written approval of the owner or his agent. The owner or his agent's signature on test charts prior to \"B\" branding will be accepted as approval. Card tests may be used to classify cattle negative on surveillance samples collected at slaughter, on routine samples collected on farms, at livestock markets, and on tests of suspicious and affected herds. (2) Manual Complement fixation test. The manual complement fixation test is an official test when it is conducted at the cooperative state- federal brucellosis laboratory using recognized methods.

(5) Buffered acidified plate antigen test. Buffered acidified plate antigen tests may be used to classify cattle as negative on MCI samples collected at slaughter and at livestock markets. This test may also be used in state- federal laboratories for routine samples collected on farms. (6) Rapid screening test (RST). The RST may be used as a test for classifying cattle as negative in state- federal laboratories. 16 | Page (7) Standard tube agglutination test (STT) or standard plate agglutination test (SPT). The bl ood or semen titers of cattle and bison tested by the STT or SPT methods are interpreted in the following ways: Attached Graphic (8) Particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay (PCFIA) test. May be used to determine the brucellosis disease status of test -eligible cattle and bison when conducted by methods approved by USDA, APHIS, VS. When used as a supplemental test on card- positive Strain 19 vaccinated dairy cattle, a negative PCFIA result will allow them to be classified as negative for intrastate movement only. (9) Concentration immunoassay test (CITE). Used as a supplemental test in market channels where cattle have been disclosed as positive by use of the card test. CITE positive animals will be considered as reactors and the remainder of the consignment be considered as exposed and moved in accordance with subsection (i)(2) of this section . (10) New tests under research. Laboratory tests approved by the executive director are authorized to be used in conjunction with tests listed in this subsection for evaluation of their future usefulness in the program.

(7) Cattle which show a positive reaction to the card test shall have another blood sample collected from them by an inspector. The inspector wil l conduct another card test and the CITE test or deliver the sample to a laboratory for a PCFIA test. If negative to the CITE or PCFIA tests, Strain 19 vaccinated dairy cattle shall be classified negative for intrastate movement only and marked on the hip with yellow paint. If negative to the CITE or PCFIA tests, beef cattle and non- Strain 19 vaccinated dairy cattle shall be classified as suspect(s) and may be permitted to return to the premises of origin under hold order for retest or be \"S\" -branded and permitted to slaughter or to a quarantined feedlot or designated pen. In either case, the remainder of the consignment may move unrestricted. Samples tested with the CITE test shall then be submitted to a state/federal laboratory in a vacutainer for supplemental testing and accompanied by a completed Form 91-28 which lists only the card positive cattle. (f) Requirements of a slaughter test. Slaughter plants operating in Texas shall collect blood from all cattle 18 months of age and over except steers and spayed heifers and finish fed cattle under 36 months of age. All blood samples collected at slaughter shall be submitted to a state- federal laboratory. Identification of the cattle 18 | Page in relation to the sample shall be maintained so that reactors or suspects may be traced to their herd of origin. The following collection procedures shall be followed: (1) Blood samples shall be collected from each animal in tubes numbered in sequence for each day's kill and placed in innercell mailing cartons furnished by USDA. (2) The samples shall be listed in numerical order on the USDA Test Record, Market Cattle Testing Program Form (VS 4- 54).

Reactors in markets or initial tests on farms and ranches will be retested at the owner or his agent's request; provided this request is within five days of his notification of the original blood test results and prior to identification of the reactors by \"B\" brand and eartag. Retest of reactors will be accomplished within five days of approval for retest in dairies and 10 days of approval for retest in beef herds. Reactor animals will be isolated from other cattle while awaiting retest. Animals classified as reactors on the retest will be branded within 48 hours of classification. Retesting of reactors on subsequent tests of the herd will be as provided f or in the herd plan. (h) Identification of brucellosis affected cattle. (1) Reactor cattle. All reactor cattle shall be permanently identified within 15 days of classification by hot iron branding with the letter \"B\" (at least two by two inches), placed high on the left hip near the tailhead. An approved reactor tag shall be placed in the left ear. Identification shall be prior to movement. (2) Exposed Cattle. All exposed cattle moving to a quarantined feedlot, designated pen, quarantined pasture, or to slaughter shall be identified by branding with a hot iron the letter \"S\" (at least two by two inches) placed high on the left hip near the tailhead. Identification shall be prior to movement, except exposed cattle on the premise of origin may be \"S\" permitted to a livestock market where they shall be identified by \"S\" brand upon arrival. Exposed cattle 19 | Page returned from the livestock market to the herd of origin are exempt from such identification. (3) Suspects. Cattle classified as suspects in markets will be identified as exposed cattle. (i) Movement of cattle classified as reactors, exposed or suspects. There shall be no diversion from the perm itted destination. When moved, the cattle must be maintained separate and apart from all other classes of livestock in pens reserved for this purpose at livestock markets or trucking facilities. These pens must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before reuse. (1) Reactors. Reactors shall remain on the premises where disclosed until a \"B\" permit for movement to immediate slaughter has been obtained. Movement for immediate slaughter must be to a slaughtering establishment where federal or state meat inspection is maintained or to a livestock market for sale to such slaughtering establishment. (2) Exposed cattle. All exposed cattle moving from a premise of origin or from a livestock market to a quarantined pasture, designated pen, quarantined feedlot, or to immediate slaughter shall remain on the premise where disclosed until an \"S\" permit VS Form 1- 27 for movement has been prepared by a TAHC Representative and signed by the person or other legal entity moving the cattle. The completed \"S\" permit shall acco mpany the shipment of cattle to the permitted destination. Movement for immediate slaughter must be to a slaughtering establishment where Federal or State meat inspection is maintained or to a livestock market for sale to such slaughtering facility. (3) S uspects. Suspects will be moved the same as exposed cattle, except at a livestock market in a consignment of otherwise negative cattle from a producer's herd of origin where the suspect is card positive on the presumptive test and negative to supplemental tests, cattle may move as follows: (A) For beef cattle and non- Strain 19 vaccinated dairy cattle, the owner shall either: (i) return the suspect under hold order to the herd of origin until: (I) the suspect is negative to the card test, in which case the hold order will be released; or (II) the suspect is classified as a reactor, in which case it must be disposed of as described in subsection (j) of this section; or (ii) sell the suspect to a quarantined feedlot, designated pen, quarantined pasture, or to slaughter, identified with an \"S\" brand and a 1- 27 permit. (B) For Strain 19 vaccinate beef cattle, the owner shall either: (i) return the suspect under hold order to the herd of origin until: (I) the suspect is negative to the card test, in which c ase the hold order will be released; or 20 | Page (II) the suspect is declared a stabilized suspect by an epidemiologist after subsequent testing conducted in not less than 30 days after the positive card test was conducted; or (III) the suspect is classified as a reactor, in which case it must be disposed of as described in subsection (j) of this section; or (ii) sell the suspect to a quarantined feedlot, designated pen, quarantined pasture, or to slaughter, identified with an \"S\" brand and a 1- 27 permit. (j) Im mediate slaughter of reactors. Reactor cattle shall be sold for immediate slaughter and removed from the premise under \"B\" permit within 15 days from the date of identification for beef cattle and within seven days from the date of identification for dairy cattle. Movement for immediate slaughter shall be to a slaughtering establishment where Federal or State inspection is maintained or to a livestock market for sale to such a slaughtering establishment. When it has been determined by the Executive Director that a specific reactor or reactors present a significant risk of spread of brucellosis, those specific animals must move direct to slaughter and may not be moved to a livestock market. (k) Removal of heifer calves from quarantined herds. Heifers born in an infected herd shall be removed from the herd immediately after they are weaned and kept as a separate heifer herd under quarantine, or moved to market with \"S\" permit to be \"S\" branded, or \"S\" branded and permitted prior to movement to a quarantined pasture, designated pen, quarantined feedlot, or slaughter. (l) Requirements following classification of a dairy or a beef animal or a bison as a reactor or a suspect. (1) The herd of which the reactor or the suspect was a part shall be placed under quarantine or hold order. When brucellosis infection is diagnosed in a herd, a quarantine will be placed on the herd. Any herd with fence line or across the road contact with the quarantined herd will be evaluated by a USDA or TAHC epidemiologist who will determ ine whether the herd should be placed under hold order. Other adjacent or high risk herds may be placed under hold order. (2) All cattle in the herd except steers and spayed heifers are included in the quarantine or hold order. Any movement of quarantined cattle shall conform to subsections (h) and (i) of this section concerning identification and movement of reactor, exposed, or suspect cattle. Release of the quarantine will be as described in paragraph (7) of this subsection. (3) An initial test of the herd which contained the reactor(s) or the suspect(s) and/or any other affected, adjacent or high risk herds will be conducted in accordance with subsection (d) of this section within a specified time set by state-federal personnel upon consultation with e ach herd owner unless waived by epidemiologist. If the Executive Director determines, based on epidemiological principles, that immediate action is necessary, the time for testing may be set without consultation with the herd owner. (4) The results of the initial herd test of the herd which contained the reactor(s) or the suspect(s) and/or any other affected, adjacent or high risk herds will be used 21 | Page to determine the need for, and development of an individual herd plan for prevention or elimination of brucellosis in that herd. The plan shall be developed by a State- Federal veterinarian of the brucellosis control program in consultation with the herd owner or caretaker and his veterinarian (if so requested by the owner). The plan developed by the Commission s hall be final and the owner or caretaker will be provided a copy. Any proposed herd plan which has identified special management requirements will be reviewed by a State- Federal epidemiologist who will either support or modify the plan. A regional epidemiologist may waive vaccinating cattle over twelve months of age in infected herds. The terms and conditions of a herd plan may be amended in writing by the Commission upon good cause. (5) The plan will consist of the following. (A) Testing Procedures. (i) All sexually intact female cattle four months of age and older and all bulls 18 months of age and older in the herd shall be presented for testing or retesting at intervals stated in the herd plan until the quarantine is released. (ii) All cattle to b e added to the herd shall be tested prior to commingling with the herd. (iii) All stray cattle found in the herd shall be presented for testing. (iv) Cattle identified as reactors shall be removed in accordance with subsection (j) of this section. (v) H eifers born in the herd shall be removed in accordance with subsection (k) of this section. (B) Vaccination Procedures. (i) All nonvaccinated heifers shall be presented as soon as possible after they reach the age of four months and before the age of 12 months to be tested for brucellosis and vaccinated with an approved B. abortus vaccine. In the event heifers tested at the time of vaccination disclose reactor level titers, they will be classified and handled as reactors. (ii) All female cattle over 12 m onths of age shall be presented to be adult vaccinated with an approved B. abortus vaccine within ten days of their negative serological test. (iii) Replacement female cattle over 12 months of age shall be presented within ten days after a negative test, to be adult vaccinated prior to their addition to an already vaccinated herd. The epidemiologist will determine if adult vaccination of replacements must continue if the quarantine extends past 18 months, or if only calfhood vaccinates may be added. (iv) Previously vaccinated negative female cattle shall be presented for revaccination with an approved B. abortus vaccine as determined by the epidemiologist. 22 | Page (6) A person may protest an initial test or a herd plan for the prevention or elimination of brucell osis in each herd classified as affected, adjacent, or high risk due to a reactor or suspect animal, after consultation with the state- federal veterinarian of the Brucellosis Control Program. (A) To protest, the herd owner must request a meeting, in writi ng, with the executive director of the commission within 15 days of receipt of the herd plan or notice of an initial test and set forth a short, plain statement of the issues that shall be the subject of the protest, after which: (i) the meeting will be s et by the executive director no later than 21 days from receipt of the request for a meeting; (ii) the meeting or meetings shall be held in Austin; and (iii) the executive director shall render his decision in writing within 14 days from date of the meet ing. (B) Upon receipt of a decision or order by the executive director which the herd owner wishes to appeal, the herd owner may file an appeal within 15 days in writing with the chairman of the commission and set forth a short, plain statement of the iss ues that shall be the subject of the appeal. (C) The subsequent hearing will be conducted pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act, and Chapter 32 of this title (relating to Hearing and Appeal Procedures). (D) If the executive director determines, based on epidemiological principles, that immediate action is necessary, the executive director may shorten the time limits, as set out in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph, to not less than five days. The herd owner must be provided with written notice of any time limits so shortened. (7) Requirements for Quarantine Release. (A) A herd is eligible for quarantine release following a minimum of three consecutive herd blood tests that are classified as negative. The first negative test shall be conducted at least 30 days after the last reactor is removed from the herd. The second negative test shall be conducted at least 120 days after the last reactor is removed from the herd. The third negative test shall be conducted a minimum of 12 months after the last reactor is removed from the herd. (B) Heifers born in the herd and were removed from the herd and kept separately shall remain under quarantine until they test negative 30 days following calving. (C) On the re leasing test, official vaccinates that demonstrate suspect titers on the approved supplemental test shall be classified as suspects. After Strain 19 vaccinated suspects are stabilized, the remainder of the herd may be released from quarantine. These suspec ts shall remain under a hold order. 23 | Page (D) To obtain a quarantine release, the owner/caretaker shall retest all cattle 18 months of age and over except steers and spayed heifers in units not under quarantine. The retest must be conducted not less than six mo nths after the removal of the last reactor from the quarantined unit. This retest, together with the third negative test of the quarantined unit, may be used for herd certification if conducted no more than 14 months following a negative herd test after the removal of the last reactor. A designated brucellosis epidemiologist may exempt units from these retest requirements. (E) Epidemiological data may be considered in the release of the quarantine. (m) Official vaccination requirements. (1) All official vaccinations will be conducted by approved personnel only. (2) Calfhood vaccinated animals shall be permanently identified. If the animal is already identified with an official eartag before vaccination, an additional official eartag is not required. Vacc ination tattoos must be applied to the right ear. For Brucella abortus Strain 19 vaccinates, the tattoo will include the U.S. Registered Shield and \"V\" which will be preceded by a number indicating the quarter of the year and followed by a number corresponding to the last digit of the year in which the vaccination was done. For Brucella abortus Strain RB 51 vaccinates, the tattoo will include the U.S. Registered Shield and \"V,\" which will be preceded by a letter \"R\" and followed by a number corresponding to the last digit of the year in which the vaccination was done. Official vaccination (orange) eartags must be applied to the right ear unless the animal is already identified with an official eartag. If the cattle or bison are registered by a breed associat ion recognized by VS, individual animal registration tattoos or individual animal registration brands may be used for identifying animals in place of official eartags. (3) Adult vaccinated cattle that have been vaccinated over calfhood age as part of authorized whole- herd vaccination plans shall be permanently identified as vaccinates by the following procedures: tattoo or by hot \"V\" brand and by official eartag. Adult -vaccinated cattle and/or bison in these herds must be identified by either a \"V\" hot brand high on the hip near the tailhead with the open end down for RB 51, open end up for Strain 19, or by an official \"AV\" (adult vaccination) tattoo in the right ear. For Brucella abortus Strain 19 vaccinated animals, the \"AV\" in the tattoo is to be preceded by a number indicating the quarter of the year, and followed by a number corresponding to the last digit of the year in which the vaccination was done. For brucella abortus Strain RB 51 vaccinated animals, the \"AV\" in the tattoo is to be preceded by the letter \"R,\" and followed by a number corresponding to the last digit of the year in which the vaccination was done. The brand or tattoo is in addition to the official eartag identification. If the cattle or bison are registered by a breed association recognized by VS, individual animal registration tattoos or individual animal registration brands may be used for identifying animals in place of official eartags. Official eartags, if required, will be placed in the right ear. (4) Vaccination will be done by state/federal personnel following a negative test within ten days prior to adult vaccination. 24 | Page (n) Community notification of infected herds. (1) The status of infected herds and the application of quarantined feedlots, designated pens, and quarantined pastures are to be made known to herd owners in the immediate community.

Negative exposed and untested test-eligible cattle must be permanently identified with a hot iron \"S\" brand high on the tailhead upon entering the quarantined feedlot. All cattle except steers and spayed heifers located in feedlots adjacent to quarantined pastures must be permanently identified with a hot iron \"S\" brand high on the tailhead upon entering such feedlots. All cattle except steers and spayed heifers leaving such feedlot must go directly to slaughter; or may be moved directly to another quarantined feedlot or designated pen with an \"S\" permit. (p) Requirements of a quarantined pasture for \"S\" -branded heifers. The Commis sion in conjunction with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS), Veterinary Services (VS) may issue an approval to a landowner or operator to operate a quarantined pasture for a period not to exceed eight months, which approval is personal to the person named, and nontransferable to any other premises from the premises described in the approval.

An on- site inspection of the premise shall be made by comm ission or USDA, APHIS, VS personnel prior to granting approval for renewal of the quarantined pasture pursuant to requirements of paragraphs (1) and (3) of this subsection. (6) An applicant denied approval may reapply any time upon a substantial change in circumstances. (q) Market cattle identification. All cattle 18 months of age and older except steers and spayed heifers which are being moved from markets to slaughtering establishments shall be identified by a USDA approved backtag placed just below the midline and just behind the shoulder of the animal. The check -in document will identify each backtagged animal to the consignor. (r) Requirements for Designated Pens. Cattle exposed to brucellosis may be moved into designated pens in feedlots provided they meet the following requirements. (1) The designated pens shall be maintained for finish feeding of cattle in dry lot with no pr ovisions for pasturing or grazing. (2) Double cattle- proof fences shall separate the designated pens from the remainder of the feedlot with at least 12 feet of space between the fences where cattle are not maintained. An alley may satisfy this separation requirement as long as neither food nor water is available and cattle are not maintained in the alley.

Requirements for Certified Brucellosis Free Herd of Cattle (a) Complete and sign herd plan agreement with the Tex as Animal Health Commission and the United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Veterinary Services. (b) Testing will be on a herd basis including all offspring that are of an age to be tested. Certified free he rd status is for a 12- month period. (c) Cattle required to be tested. All cattle, except steers and spayed heifers, are subject to test requirements at 18 months of age. (d) Qualifying methods. A herd may qualify by one or more of the following methods: (1) Initial certification. (A) Brucellosis Milk Surveillance Test (BMST). A minimum of four consecutive, negative brucellosis milk surveillance tests conducted at not less than 90- day intervals, followed by a negative herd blood test conducted within 90 days after the last negative brucellosis milk surveillance test. (B) Complete herd blood test. Two consecutive, negative blood tests of all cattle required to be tested not less than 10 months, nor more than 14 months apart. (2) Recertification. For continuous certification, a herd must have a negative herd blood test of all cattle required to be tested conducted within 60 days before the certification anniversary date. If the certification test is conducted within 60 days after the anniversary date, the certification period will be 12 months from the anniversary and no t 12 months from the date of the recertifying test. During the interval between the anniversary date and the recertifying test, certification will be suspended. If a herd blood test for recertification is not conducted within 60 days after the anniversary date, the certification requirements are the same as for initial certification. BMST procedures are not used for recertifying herds. (3) Purchase of a certified free herd. (A) A negative herd blood test is not required when the cattle remain on the premi ses. A new certificate will be issued in the owner's name. The anniversary date and the herd number will remain the same.

The anniversary date of the new herd is established by the test date of the herd of origin or by a new herd test of the purchased cattle. 29 | Page (e) Qualifying Standards. (1) Herd infection rates. The individual herd mus t disclose no evidence of infection at the time of initial certification or recertification. (A negative blood test and a complete epidemiological investigation may be used to resolve a suspicious BMST in qualifying a dairy herd.) (2) Animal infection rat es. The individual animals must disclose no evidence of infection at the time of initial herd certification or recertification. (3) Suspects. When suspects are disclosed, an individual herd plan shall be developed for the future testing of the suspect(s) and the handling of the herd. (4) Herd status, if reactors are classified. When one or more reactors are disclosed in a certified herd or in a herd under test for initial certification, it shall be considered affected and the quarantine and retest provisi ons shall apply. If a retest of a certified herd or of animals from such a herd reveals only one reactor, the certification status will be suspended until all provisions for release of quarantine have been met. If more than one reactor is disclosed, the herd certification is terminated until all provisions for release of quarantine have been met, and when additional provisions for initial certified brucellosis -free herd status required under subsection (d)(1) of this section have been met. Herd retests for quarantine release, and to fulfill the provisions required under subsection (d)(1) of this section may be conducted concurrently. (5) Movement of cattle into a certified brucellosis -free herd. (A) From certified brucellosis -free herds or class free states or areas. No test requirements on breeding or dairy cattle originating from certified brucellosis - free herds or class free states or areas. Cattle added to a certified brucellosis - free herd under this provision shall not receive new herd status for sale purposes until they have passed a 60- 120 day post -entry retest. (B) From Class \"A\" or \"B\" states or areas. Cattle required to be tested from herds not under quarantine must meet all interstate and intrastate movement requirements and must be retested negative between 60 and 120 days after being moved. Cattle added to a certified brucellosis -free herd under this provision shall not receive new herd status for sale purposes until they have passed a 60- 120 day post -entry retest and have been included in an anniversary herd test. (f) Proof of qualifying as a certified brucellosis herd. (1) Initially a certificate will be issued. (2) Recertification will be done by renewal certificate showing only the certified free herd number, number of animals, and owner.

Procedures for Handling Brucellosis Infected, Adjacent, and High Risk Herds of Swine (a) Infected herds. All swine in infected herds must be confined to the premises under quarantine until the herd has been freed of brucellosis or sold for slaughter under permit. Three negative infected herd retests are required for release of quarantine, with the first retest occurring not sooner than 30 days nor more than 60 days after all reactors have been removed for slaughter. The second retest must be conducted 60 to 90 days after the first negative retest. A third negative infected herd retest is required 60 to 90 days following the second retest. Her ds of origin of market swine test (MST) reactors that fail to reveal additional reactors on a herd test would not be required to be held under quarantine for additional testing unless there is evidence of Brucella infection or exposure to brucellosis. 40 | Page (b) Adjacent and high risk herds. All swine in adjacent and high risk herds may be quarantined until an epidemiologist through testing or other epidemiological evidence determines the herd is not infected or not at risk of becoming infected. (c) Depopulation. Any infected, adjacent, or high risk herd may be depopulated. The commission may order depopulation of a herd following a determination by the epidemiologist that the herd is a problem herd based on test results or other epidemiological data involving the herd. (d) Indemnity. Indemnity may be paid to the herd owner, whose herd has been ordered depopulated, if funds are made available for indemnity purposes. The following criteria will be used in the payment of indemnity. (1) The entire herd (all swine under common ownership or management) must have been declared as infected or exposed. (2) An indemnity agreement must be signed and approved for payment by the executive director and the USDA, APHIS, VS veterinarian- in-charge. (3) The herd owner must comply wit h each requirement pertaining to herd depopulation and payment for indemnity. (4) All swine in a herd must be depopulated. They will be either permitted to slaughter on a VS Form 1- 27 or euthanized. (5) State indemnity funds, when available, will be used f or the reimbursement to the owner for swine not eligible for federal indemnity funds. The amount of state indemnity will be determined by an appraisal of the market value of the swine at time of depopulation less salvage, not to exceed $50 per head.

The following procedures should be carried out: (A) market the entire herd for slaughter as soon as practicable; (B) clean and disinf ect houses and equipment; (C) restock premises with animals preferably from validated brucellosis -free herds, placing them on ground that has been free of swine for at least 60 days. 41 | Page (2) Plan two. This plan is recommended for use in infected purebred herds only where it is desired to retain valuable bloodlines. The following procedures should be carried out: (A) separate gilt pigs from sows at 28 days of age or less and isolate; (B) market infected herd for slaughter as soon as practicable. Infected sows should not be rebred and should be slaughtered as soon as possible. Complete isolation of infected animals is essential. The separated weanling pigs form the nucleus for establishment of the infection- free herd; (C) test the gilts to be used for the following breeding season about 30 days before breeding. Save only the gilts that are negative. Breed only to negative boars; (D) retest the gilts after farrowing and before removing them from individual farrowing pens. If reactors are found, they should be segregated from the remainder of the herd and slaughtered as soon as possible. Select only pigs from negative sows for breeding gilts; (E) after three consecutive negative infected herd retests the herd is eligible for release from quarantine. The first test must be at least 30 days after all reactors have been removed and slaughtered and the second test must be 60 to 90 days after the first test. A third test is required 60 to 90 days following the second negative retest. (3) Plan three. This plan is not recommended in general, but it has been found useful in herds where only a few reactors are found and where no clinical symptoms of brucellosis have been noted. Carry out the following procedures: (A) market reactors(s) for slaughter; (B) retest herd at 30 -day intervals removing reactors for slaughter until the entire herd is negative; (C) if the herd is not readily freed of infection, abandon this plan in favor of plan one or plan two. (D) After three consecutive negative infected herd retests the herd is eligible for release from quarantine. The first test must be at least 30 days after all reactors have been removed and slaughtered and the second test must be 60 to 90 days after the first test. A third test of the herd is required 60 to 90 days following the second negative retest.

Initial Validation and Revalidation of Individual Swine Herd (a) Qualifying methods. Swine herds may be validated or revalidated as brucellosis - free by the following methods. (1) Complete herd test. Swine herds may be initially validated or revalidated when the herd test is negative. (2) Increment testing. Swine herds may be validated or revalidated when all breeding swine (six months of age and older) in the herd are tested negative in the 25% increments every 80 to 105 days or in 10% increments every 25 to 35 days according to a specified herd testing plan with each breeding animal in the herd tested at least once during the one- year validation period. No swine m ay be tested twice in one year to comply with the 25% requirement or twice in 10 months to comply with the 10% requirement. (b) Conditions for validating the herd. (1) Size of unit. Validated free herd status applies to entire herds and includes all offspr ing. (2) Duration of status. A herd is validated for 12 months. There is no grace period. (3) Testing period. (A) For initial validation, a herd can be validated based on the results of one negative herd test or through increment testing on a quarterly or monthly basis. (B) For revalidation a herd must: (i) have a negative herd test conducted within 10 to 12 months of the last validation date; or (ii) show that all breeding swine (six months of age and older) in the herd are tested negative in 25% incr ements every 80 to 105 days or in 10% increments every 25 to 35 days according to a specified herd testing plan, with each breeding animal tested at least once during the one- year validation period. No swine may be tested twice in one year to comply with the 25% requirement or twice in 10 months to comply with the 10% requirement. 43 | Page (4) Herd infection rate. There must be no evidence of infection at the time the herd is initially validated or revalidated. (5) Animal infection rate. There must be no evidence of infection in individual animals at the time the herd is initially validated or revalidated. (6) Suspects. If swine that are classified as suspect are found in a herd that is otherwise serologically, bacteriologically, and epidemiologically negative, the herd may be held under quarantine until the suspects are further evaluated and their status is determined. (7) Herd status, if infection occurs. When one or more reactors are found in a validated herd or in a herd being tested for initial validation, it will be considered infected and quarantined and the eradication procedures in this section will apply. (A) Initial validation. A herd qualifies for initial validated brucellosis -free status when it is free of infection, when all provisions for release of quarantine have been met, and when the additional provisions required under subsection (a)(1) of this section have been met. (B) Revalidation. If a complete or partial test of a validated herd reveals reactors, herd validation status is terminated until all provisions for release of quarantine have been met, and the additional provisions for initial validated brucellosis -free herd status required under subsection (a)(1) of this section have been met. (C) Herd retests for release of quarantine may also be used to fulfill the provisions required under subsection (a)(1) of this section. (8) Movement of swine into validated brucellosis -free herds. (A) Swine originating from validated brucellosis -free herds may enter without test. (B) Breeding swine originating from nonvalidated herds must have a negative test within 30 days prior to date of entry. These animals must be held in isolation and be retested 30 to 60 days after arrival. (C) Swine from feedlots m ay not be added to validated brucellosis -free herds. However, swine may be consigned to feedlots on premises with validated brucellosis -free herds without testing, provided those swine are held in isolation and segregated from all breeding stock. (D) Cons ignments of slaughter swine may not be added to validated brucellosis -free herds. (9) Use of swine semen in validated brucellosis -free herds. All semen used must be from boars in validated brucellosis -free herds.

Definition of Terms The following words and terms, when used in this chapter, shall have the following meanings, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. (1) Adjacent premise-- A premise that borders an exposed or infested premise, including premises separated by roads, double fences, or fordable streams. A premise that would normally be classified as adjacent may be exempted from adjacent premise requirements by a State or Federal epidemiologist if the premise is separated from the exposed or infested premise by double fencing, sufficient to prevent the spread of ticks, with one of the fences being game- proof. (2) Animal --Any domestic, free -range, or wild animal capable of hosting or transporting ticks capable of carrying Babesia, including livestock; zebras, bison, and giraffes; and deer, elk, and other cervid species. (3) Certificate --A document authorizing movement of livestock issued by an authorized representative of the commission after the livestock have been treated in a manner prescribed by the commission for the area and premise from which they originate. (4) Check premise--A premise located in a tick eradication quarantine area, temporary preventative quarantine area, or control purpose quarantine area that is not classified as an infested, exposed, or adjacent premise. (5) Control purpose quarantine area--A premise or property designated by the commission for a syst ematic inspection of livestock and premises and control of the movement of livestock in order to investigate and control a suspected exposure of animals to ticks outside the tick eradication quarantine area. The boundaries of the area will be determined by evaluation of the barriers to the potential spread of ticks. (6) Designated Fever Tick Epidemiologist (DFTE) --A State or Federal epidemiologist designated to make decisions concerning the use and interpretation of exposure to fever ticks and to manage the Fever Tick program. The DFTE must be selected jointly by the Executive Director of the commission and the USDA -APHIS, VS representative for Texas. The DFTE has the responsibility to determine the scope of epidemiologic investigations, determine the status of herds, assist in development of individual herd plans, and coordinate fever tick surveillance and eradication programs within his or her geographic area of responsibility. The DFTE has authority to make independent decisions concerning the management of herds and use of property and limiting the impact of wildlife when those decisions are supported by sound fever tick eradication principles. 112 | Page (7) Dipping or treating--If the commission requires livestock to be dipped, the livestock shall be submerged in a vat. A spray- dip machine may be used in areas where a vat is not reasonably available. Careful hand spraying may be used for easily restrained horses and show cattle, and when specifically authorized, certain zoo or domestic animals. Livestock unable to go through a dipping vat because of size or physical condition may be hand sprayed. The treatment must be paint marked so that it can be identified for at least 17 days.

(2) Cervidae herds in which M. bovis is confirmed shall remain under quarantine if not depopulated, and must pass three consecutive official tuberculosis tests of all animals. The first test must be conducted 90 days or more after the last test yielding a positive animal, with two additional tests at 180- day minimum inter vals. Five annual complete herd tests of all animals shall be given following the release from quarantine. (3) Cervidae herds that have had a test of all eligible animals with NGL reactors only and no evidence of tuberculosis infection is found by histopathology and culture of M. bovis (including selected NGL specimens submitted from animals having no gross lesions indicative of tuberculosis) may be released without further restrictions. (4) Cervidae herds in which compatible or suggestive lesions are found by histopathology without the isolation of M. bovis may be released from quarantine following a negative 90 -day retest of the entire herd, provided there is no known association with M. bovis. (5) Cervidae herds that exhibit NGL reactors in which no ev idence of tuberculosis infection is found by histopathology and culture of M. bovis and are unable to conduct a test of all eligible animals, shall be evaluated by the state and/or regional tuberculosis epidemiologist for possible release of quarantine. (h) Procedures in affected herds. Disclosure of tuberculosis in any herd shall be followed by a complete epidemiological investigation. All cervids in herds from which tuberculosis animals originate, and all cervids that are known to have associated with af fected cervids or other affected animals, shall be tested promptly. These procedures shall apply to adjacent and contact herds as well as to the evaluation and testing of possible source herds for the affected herd. Herds that have received exposed animals shall be tested following the slaughter or testing of the exposed animals. Every effort shall be made to ensure the immediate elimination of the 160 | Page disease from all species of animals on the premises. The herd shall be handled as outlined under subsection (g) of this section. (i) Retest Schedules for High Risk Herds. (1) In herds with a history of lesions compatible or suggestive for tuberculosis by histopathology, two complete annual herd tests shall be given after release from quarantine. Herds with a bac teriologic isolation of a Mycobacteria species other than M. bovis should be considered negative for bovine tuberculosis with no further testing requirements. (2) In a newly assembled herd on premises where a tuberculosis herd has been depopulated, two an nual herd tests shall be applied to all animals. The first test must be approximately six months after assembly of the new herd. If the premises are vacated for over one year, these requirements may be waived. (3) Exposed animals previously sold from know n infected herds shall be depopulated if possible, or tested with the SCT or Stat Pak/DPP by State or Federal veterinarians. All animals non- negative to either test shall be classified as reactors. (A) If bovine tuberculosis is confirmed in the exposed animal(s), the remainder of the receiving herd shall be classified as an infected herd and handled according to subsection (g)(2) of this section. (B) If negative to the test, the exposed animal(s) will subsequently be handled as if a part of the infected h erd of origin for purposes of testing, quarantine release, and the five annual high- risk tests. The remainder of the herd shall be tested at the time of the initial investigation and retested in one year with the SCT or Stat Pak/DPP. Supplemental diagnosti c tests may be used if needed. (4) Herds indicated as the source(s) of animals in slaughter traceback investigations shall be placed under quarantine within 30 days of notification to the area office, and a herd test scheduled. Testing of source herds of slaughter animals having lesions of tuberculosis shall be done by state or federal regulatory veterinarians using the SCT or Stat Pak/DPP. (A) If the herd of origin is positively identified and M. bovis has been confirmed by bacterial isolation from the s laughter animal, all animals responding to the SCT or Stat Pak/DPP shall be classified as reactors. In all other cases, supplemental diagnostic tests may be used. (B) In herds identified as the source of culture negative lesioned animals, responding animals may be classified as reactors or suspects. If classified as suspects, they may be retested by supplemental diagnostic tests. (j) Cleaning and disinfection of premises, conveyances, and materials. All premises, including all structures, holding faciliti es, conveyances, and materials that are determined by program officials to constitute a health hazard to humans or animals because of tuberculosis, shall be properly cleaned and disinfected. This shall be done within 15 days after the removal of tuberculos is-affected or exposed cervids in 161 | Page accordance with approved procedures. However, these officials may extend the time limit for disinfection to 30 days when a request for such extension is received prior to the expiration date of the original 15- day period allowed.

To meet the requirements for qualifi ed herd status, the herd must pass one official test for tuberculosis, within a seven month period with no evidence of bovine tuberculosis disclosed. The qualified herd status remains in effect for 12 months following the qualifying test. (3) Additions. H erd additions must originate directly from one of the following: (A) an accredited herd; (B) a monitored or qualified herd, provided that the individual animals for addition were negative to an official tuberculosis test conducted within 90 days prior to entry; (C) a herd not meeting the requirements of subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph. Individual animals for addition must be isolated from other members of the herd of origin and must have negative results to two official tests for tuberculosis, conducted at least 90 days apart, provided that the second test was conducted within 90 days prior to movement to the premises of the qualified herd. The additions must be kept in isolation from all members of the qualified herd until they are negative to an official tuberculosis test conducted at least 90 days following the date of entry. (4) Animals added under paragraph (3)(C) of this subsection shall not receive qualified herd status for sale or movement purposes until they are negative to a retest 90 days after entry. (d) Surveyed Herd. (1) Requirements --Surveillance records must be m aintained on all animals over one year of age harvested and inspected or tested without evidence of bovine tuberculosis: (A) at an approved slaughter facility with state/federal meat inspection, approved diagnostic laboratory; and/or (B) routine tubercul osis testing of individual animals or consignments performed by a designated accredited veterinarian; and/or (C) other appropriate methods of surveillance approved by a representative of the TAHC. (2) A surveyed herd must identify animals at a rate to detect infection at a 2.0% prevalence level with 95% confidence. This rate would require an annual survey of a minimum of one- third of the total number of animals prescribed in appendix 1 for each specified herd size. 164 | Page (3) Qualification and maintenance of surveyed herd status. An annual report shall be submitted by the person, firm, or corporation responsible for management of the herd to the Commission at the time of qualifying and prior to each anniversary date. The report shall include the estimated number of breeding age animals currently in the herd and the number of animals over one year of age surveyed during the preceding year. (e) Status of newly assembled herds. A newly assembled herd shall assume the herd status of the herd from which the animals originated. If the herd is assembled from more than one herd, it shall assume the status of the originating herd with the lowest status. A newly assembled herd shall also assume the testing schedule of the herd which status it assumes. These animals must have no exposure to cervidae from herds of lesser status than the herd of origin which is determining the status of the newly assembled herd.

At least 30 birds per flock are tested monthly by an approved laboratory. (B) Established flock: This is a flock that has been maintained together for at least 21 days prior to sample collection with no additions to the flock. For an established flock to qualify for the first shipment into the LBM system or to requalify after any breaks in the monthly sample- testing regimen, 30 birds must be tested by AGID or other approved procedure within 10 days prior to movement. (C) Commingled flock: This is a group of poultry from multiple sources that has been assembled for one or more ship ments. When untested birds are added to the flock, previous test reports are void and the flock must requalify as an established flock by waiting 21 days before resampling, and then following the protocol as for a nonmonitored flock. (D) Nonmonitored flock : This is a flock that has not been on a program of monthly testing for at least 3 months. To qualify for sale in the LBM system, 30 birds in a nonmonitored flock must have been tested within 10 days of movement. (f) Infected flock. Any Live Bird Marketing System flock where fowl are positive on virus isolation or RRT -PCR for a disease reportable to the Commission under Chapter 45 of this title (relating to Reportable Diseases): (1) Any specimens positive for virus will be submitted to the NVSL for virus isolation and characterization. The premises will be movement restricted by a hold order until results are obtained from the NVSL. (2) Infected flocks will be placed under quarantine, the fowl depopulated, and the facility cleaned and disinfected unless an alternate approach to disease elimination is approved by the Commission. No new fowl may be added to the quarantined flock unless approved by the Commission. A flock plan shall be developed between the flock owner and the Commission addressing the length of time the facility is to remain vacant of fowl, the testing schedule following repopulation, and other details germane to the management of the flock and elimination of disease. 239 | Page (3) RRT -PCR or VI positives at LBMs and distribution facilities will result in trace - backs to a supplier of origin by State or Federal personnel in the State of origin. (g) Violations of these requirements will be handled as provided in \u00a754.8 of this title (relating to Enforcement).

(5) Continued for at least 5 years. (i) Post -exposure management and monitoring plans are for exposed flocks that were not source flocks and in which a scrapie infected animal did not give birth. A Designated Scrapie Epidemiologist shall determine the testing and monitoring requirements for these flocks based on the exposure risk of the individual flock. 313 | Page (j) Waiver of requirements for scrapie control pilot projects is allowable if approved by the Administrator of APHIS and the state has a Pilot Project MOU in place. (k) Minimum Requirements for Pilot Project Flock Plans: (1) Restriction of high- risk animals to the premises for movement to slaughter only; (2) Necropsy and testing of all animals over 14 months of age that die, particularly high- risk animals; (3) Third eye- lid testing of all exposed animals over 14 months of age, or when they reach 14 months of age; (4) Retest of all test eligible animals 18 months after the last k nown exposure to scrapie; (5) Removal of all test -positive animals; (6) Restrictions on the movements of other animals out of the flock except to slaughter unless testing or other methods have been used to insure that they are low risk for spreading scrapie; and, (7) Genotype testing for use as a selection criteria. (8) Removal of all QQ animals. (9) May keep QR and RR animals. (10) Purchase of RR ram(s).

Exhibition Requirements (a) Official premises identi fication is required for sexually intact sheep to be exhibited. For goats, the registration tattoo may be used in lieu of the eartag if the registration papers are in accompaniment of the animals. (b) All female animals over 12 months of age (as evidenced by the eruption of the first pair of incisors) shall be penned separately from animals from different flocks. All animals enrolled in the Scrapie Flock Certification Program shall be handled in such a way that direct contact does not occur with animals fr om other flocks of lower status. Spacing or solid partitions may be used to maintain separation. (c) If sheep or goats within 30 days pre- or post -parturition, or have a vaginal discharge, are allowed to show, special arrangements shall be made to keep th em separate from animals from different flocks and in an area that can and will be properly disinfected, in accordance with 9CFR 54.7.
