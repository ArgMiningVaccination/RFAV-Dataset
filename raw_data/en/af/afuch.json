Woodward, PhD Clinical Psychologist My Locations About Me I am honored to be integrated into the multidisciplinary team at the Duke Fertility Center helping patients to pursue fertility treatment and alternate means of building their families. Our patients are resilient, interesting people facing one of the toughest challenges of their lives. It is incredibly meaningful to be able to share information, insight, or strategies to support them in this journey. When not at Duke, I love to spend time with my husband. We hike, camp, and travel whenever possible. I've been involved in a monthly book club for almost 15 years with a wonderful group of women who like good food, great conversation, and good stories. And to keep my own stress in check, I make time to do things like spend time with family and friends, cook, run, do yoga, read, or meditate. Training and Education Clinical Focus and Research I am particularly interested in the psychological and familial outcomes for women and men becoming first-time parents after 40, and, in determining what factors promote optimal coping among patients facing prolonged treatment for infertility.
