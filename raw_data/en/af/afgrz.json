In this article, we take a deeper look at what dengue fever is, its causes and symptoms, and a few home remedies you can try. Scroll down to know more. In This Article What Is Dengue Fever? Dengue fever is the result of a viral infection that is transmitted by mosquitoes. It is also referred to as dandy fever and breakbone fever. Its causes are discussed below. What Causes Dengue Fever? Dengue fever is mainly caused by viral infections transmitted by mosquitoes belonging to the Aedes family. The most common culprit is the Aedes aegypti mosquito. When a mosquito bites an infected individual, the dengue virus enters that mosquito. This mosquito then transfers the virus to the next person it bites, and the cycle continues. There are four types of dengue viruses (DENV) that cause dengue. If you are infected by one of these viruses, your body becomes immune to that particular mosquito. But in such scenarios, your chance of becoming infected by the other three types of dengue viruses and developing dengue hemorrhagic fever increases. Dengue fever can give rise to various symptoms. Some of the most common ones are listed below. What Are The Symptoms Of Dengue Fever? The symptoms that surface with the onset of dengue fever are: - High body temperature (Fever) - Headaches - Vomiting and [nausea](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/what-to-eat-when-nauseous/) - Pain behind the eyes - Rash - Swollen glands Dengue can also have more severe symptoms like: - Severe stomach pain [Bleeding gums](https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/effective-home-remedies-for-bleeding-gums/)or nose - Blood in stool or urine - Difficulty in breathing - Skin bruising as a result of bleeding under the skin - Cold and clammy skin - Fatigue and irritation It is important to treat these initial symptoms at the earliest to avoid complications.
