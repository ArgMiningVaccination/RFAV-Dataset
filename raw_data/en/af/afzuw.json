Section II A captures your enrollment progress as well as changes in the number and/or rate of uninsured children in your state. Section II B captures progress towards meeting your state's general strategic objectives and performance goals. Section IIA: Enrollment And Uninsured Data 1. The information in the table below is the Unduplicated Number of Children Ever Enrolled in CHIP in your state for the two most recent reporting periods. The enrollment numbers reported below should correspond to line 7 (Unduplicated # Ever Enrolled Year) in your state's 4th quarter data report (submitted in October) in the CHIP Statistical Enrollment Data System (SEDS). The percent change column reflects the percent change in enrollment over the two -year period. If the percent change exceeds 10 percent (increase or decrease), please explain in letter A below any factors that may account for these changes (such as decreases due to elimination of outreach or increases due to program expansions). This information will be filled in automatically by CARTS through a link to SEDS. Please wait until you have an enrollment number from SEDS before you complete this response. If the information displayed in the table below is inaccurate, please make any needed updates to the data in SEDS and then refresh this page in CARTS to reflect the updated data.

[7500] CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2018 14 Section IIB: State Strategic Objectives And Performance Goals This subsection gathers information on your state's general strategic objectives, performance goals, performance measures and progress towards meeting goals, as specified in your CHIP state plan. (If your goals reported in the annual report now differ from Section 9 of your CHIP state plan, please indicate how they differ in \"Other Comments on Measure.\" Also, the state plan should be amended to reconcile these differences). The format of this section provides your state with an opportunity to track progress over time. This section contains templates for reporting performance measurement data for each of five categories of strategic objectives, related to: Reducing the number of uninsured children CHIP enrollment Medicaid enrollment Increasing access to care Use of preventative care (immunizations, well child care) Please report performance measurement data for the three most recent years for which data are available (to the extent that data are available). In the first two columns, data from the previou s two years' annual reports (FFY 2016 and FFY 201 7) will be populated with data from previously reported data in CARTS. If you reported data in the two previous years' reports and you want to update/change the data, please enter that data. If you reporte d no data for either of those two years, but you now have data available for them, please enter the data. In the third column, please report the most recent data available at the time you are submitting the current annual report (FFY 201 8). In this secti on, the term performance measure is used to refer to any data your state provides as evidence towards a particular goal within a strategic objective. For the purpose of this section, \"objectives\" refer to the five broad categories listed above, while \"goa ls\" are state -specific, and should be listed in the appropriate subsections within the space provided for each objective. NOTES: Please do not reference attachments in this section. If details about a particular measure are located in an attachment, plea se summarize the relevant information from the attachment in the space provided for each measure. In addition, please do not report the same data that were reported for Child Core Set reporting. The intent of this section is to capture goals and measures that your state did not report elsewhere. As a reminder, Child Core Set reporting migrated to MACPRO in December 2015. Historical data are still available for viewing in CARTS. Additional instructions for completing each row of the table are provided bel ow. A. Goal: For each objective, space has been provided to report up to three goals. Use this section to provide a brief description of each goal you are reporting within a given strategic objective . All new goals should include a direction and a target. For clarification only, an example goal would be : \"Increase (direction) by 5 percent (target) the number of CHIP beneficiaries who turned 13 years old during the measurement year who had a second dose of MMR, three hepatitis B vaccinations and one varicel la vaccination by their 13th birthday.\" B. Type of Goal: For each goal you are reporting within a given strategic objective, please indicate the type of goal, as follows: CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2018 15 New/revised: Check this box if you have revised or added a goal. Please explain how and why the goal was revised. Continuing: Check this box if the goal you are reporting is the same one you have reported in previous annual reports. Discontinued: Check this box if y ou have met your goal and/or are discontinuing a goal. Please explain why the goal was discontinued. GAL C. Status of Data Reported: Please indicate the status of the data you are reporting for each goal, as follows: Provisional: Check this box if you are reporting performance measure data for a goal, but the data are currently being modified, verified, or may change in any other way before you finalize them for FFY 201 8. Explanation of Provisional Data - When the value of the Sta tus of Data Reported field is selected as \"Provisional\", the state must specify why the data are provisional and when the state expects the data will be final. Final: Check this box if the data you are reporting are considered final for FFY 201 8. Same data as reported in a previous year's annual report: Check this box if the data you are reporting are the same data that your state reported for the goal in another annual report. Indicate in which year's annual report you previously reported the data. D. Meas urement Specification: This section is included for only two of the objectives \u2014 objectives related to increasing access to care, and objectives related to use of preventative care \u2014because these are the two objectives for which states may report using the H EDIS\u00ae measurement specification. In this section, for each goal, please indicate the measurement specification used to calculate your performance measure data (i.e., were the measures calculated using the HEDIS\u00ae specifications or some other method unrelat ed to HEDIS\u00ae). Please indicate whether the measure is based on HEDIS\u00ae technical specifications or another source. If HEDIS\u00ae is selected, the HEDIS\u00ae Version field must be completed. If \"Other\" measurement specification is selected, the explanation field m ust be completed. HEDIS\u00ae Version: Please s pecify HEDIS\u00ae Version (example 2016). This field must be completed only when a user select s the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specification. \"Other\" measurement specification explanation: If \"Other\", measurement specification is selected, please complete the explanation of the \"Other\" measurement specification. The explanation field must be completed when \"Other\" measurement specification has been selected. E. Data Source: For each performance measure, please indic ate the source of data. The categories provided in this section vary by objective. For the objectives related to reducing the number of uninsured children and CHIP or Medicaid enrollment, please indicate whether you have used eligibility/enrollment data, survey data (specify the survey used), or other source (specify the other source). For the objectives related to access to care and use of preventative care, please indicate whether you used administrative data (claims) (specify the kind of administrativ e data used), hybrid data (claims and medical records) (specify how the two were used to create the data source), survey data (specify the survey used), or other source (specify the other source). In all cases, if another data source was used, please expl ain the source. CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2018 16 F. Definition of Population Included in Measure: Numerator: Please indicate the definition of the population included in the numerator for each measure (such as the number of visits required for inclusion, e.g., one or more visits in the pas t year). Denominator: Please indicate the definition of the population included in the denominator for each measure. For measures related to increasing access to care and use of preventative care, please Check one box to indicate whether the data are f or the CHIP population only, or include both CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) children combined. If the denominator reported is not fully representative of the population defined above (the CHIP population only, orthe CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) populatio ns combined), please further define the denominator. For example, denominator includes only children enrolled in managed care in certain counties, technological limitations preventing reporting on the full population defined, etc.). Please report informati on on exclusions in the definition of the denominator (including the proportion of children excluded), The provision of this information is important and will provide CMS with a context so that comparability of denominators across the states and over time can occur. G. Deviations from Measure Specification For the measures related to increasing access to care and use of preventative care. If the data provided for a measure deviates from the measure specification, please select the type(s) of measure specification deviation. The types of deviation parallel the measure specification categories for each measure. Each type of deviation is accompanied by a comment field that states must use to explain in greater detail or further specify the deviation when a deviation(s) from a measure is selected. The five types (and examples) of deviations are: Year of Data (e.g., partial year), Data Source (e.g., use of different data sources among health plans or delivery systems), Numerator (e.g., coding issues), Denominator (e.g., exclusion of MCOs, different age groups, definition of continuous enrollment), Other. When one or more of the types are selected, states are required to provide an explanation. Please report the year of data for each performance measur e. The year (or months) should correspond to the period in which enrollment or utilization took place . Do not report the year in which data were collected for the measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may be different from the period corresponding to enrollment or utilization of services. H. Date Range: available for 201 8 CARTS reporting period. Please define the date range for the reporting period based on the \"From\" time period as the month and year which corresponds to the beginning period in which utilization took place and please report the \"To\" time period as the month and year which corresponds to the end period in which utilization took place. Do not report the year in which data were collected for th e measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may be different from the period corresponding to utilization of services. I. Performance Measurement Data (HEDIS\u00ae or Other): In this section, please report the numerators and denominators, rates for each measure (or component). The template provides two sections for entering the performance measurement data, depending on CHIP A nnual Report Template - FFY 2018 17 whether you are reporting using HEDIS\u00ae or other methodolo gies. The form fields have been set up to facilitate entering numerators and denominators for each measure. If the form fields do not give you enough space to fully report on the measure, please use the \"additional notes\" section. The preferred method i s to calculate a \"weighted rate\" by summing the numerators and denominators across plans, and then deriving a single state -level rate based on the ratio of the numerator to the denominator). The reporting unit for each measure is the state as a whole. If states calculate rates for multiple reporting units (e.g., individual health plans, different health care delivery systems), states must aggregate data from all these sources into one state rate before reporting the data to CMS. In the situation where a state combines data across multiple reporting units, all or some of which use the hybrid method to calculate the rates, the state should enter zeroes in the \"Numerator\" and \"Denominator\" fields. In these cases, it should report the state -level rate in the \"Rate\" field and, when possible, include individual reporting unit numerators, denominators, and rates in the field labeled \"Additional Notes on Measure,\" along with a description of the method used to derive the state -level rate. J. Explanation of Progres s: The intent of this section is to allow your state to highlight progress and describe any quality -improvement activities that may have contributed to your progress. Any quality -improvement activity described should involve the CHIP program, benefit CHIP enrollees, and relate to the performance measure and your progress. An example of a quality -improvement activity is a state -wide initiative to inform individual families directly of their children's immunization status with the goal of increasing immuniz ation rates. CHIP would either be the primary lead or substantially involved in the project. If improvement has not occurred over time, this section can be used to discuss potential reasons for why progress was not seen and to describe future quality -improvement plans. In this section, your state is also asked to set annual performance objectives for FFY 201 9, 2020 and 202 1. Based on your recent performance on the measure (from FFY 201 6 through 201 8), use a combination of expert opinion and \"best guesses \" to set objectives for the next three years. Please explain your rationale for setting these objectives. For example, if your rate has been increasing by 3 or 4 percentage points per year, you might project future increases at a similar rate. On the ot her hand, if your rate has been stable over time, you might set a target that projects a small increase over time. If the rate has been fluctuating over time, you might look more closely at the data to ensure that the fluctuations are not an artifact of t he data or the methods used to construct a rate. You might set an initial target that is an average of the recent rates, with slight increases in subsequent years. In future annual reports, you will be asked to comment on how your actual performance compa res to the objective your state set for the year, as well as any quality -improvement activities that have helped or could help your state meet future objectives. K. Other Comments on Measure: Please use this section to provide any other comments on the mea sure, such as data limitations, plans to report on a measure in the future, or differences between performance measures reported here and those discussed in Section 9 of the CHIP state plan.

What other strategies does your state use to measure and report on access to, quality, or outcomes of care received by your CHIP population? What have you found? [7500] The Core Set of Children's Health Care Quality Measures (Child Core Set) provides a national - and state -level snapshot of the quality of care provided to children in Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). It is also used as a tool for driving improvements in quality by identifying best practices and lessons learned for sharing across states. For FY 2017 reporting, Alabama reported 26 of the 27 Child Core Set measures and continues to develop the capacity to report on all of them. For more information on outcomes and key characteristics, please refer to the following website: https://www.medicaid.g ov/state - overviews/stateprofile.html?state=alabama 2. What strategies does your CHIP program have for future measurement and reporting on access to, quality, or outcomes of care received by your CHIP population? When will data be available? [7500] No additional strategies are planned at this time. 3. Have you conducted any focused quality studies on your CHIP population, e.g., adolescents, attention deficit disorder, substance abuse, special heath care needs or other emerging health care needs? What have you found? [7500] Each year, AL CHIP contracts with the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) for special studies of the ALL Kids population. Several studies are in the design and implementation phases for the upcoming fiscal year. As well, five studies and a policy brief have been finalized this past year. 4. Please attach any additional studies, analyses or other documents addressing outreach, enrollment, access, quality, utilization, costs, satisfaction, or other aspects of your CHIP program's performance. Please include any analyses or des criptions of any efforts designed to reduce the number of uncovered children in the state through a state health insurance connector program or support for innovative private health coverage initiatives. [7500] UAB and ALL Kids Special Projects in Health S ervices Research Executive summaries of the main findings for each of five studies are included below. A full report is available upon request. This summarizes the findings of four research projects conducted by researchers at the UAB School of Public Health in collaboration with colleagues at Indiana University -Indianapolis and Texas A&M. Our empirical research has examined the following questions: 1) How have opioid prescribing patterns changed over time and what factors predict opioid misuse? 2) What are the determinants and consequences of high quality follow -up care after a mental health hospitalization? 3) How did a large copayment increase im pact ED utilization overall and for low -severity conditions? 4) How prevalent are obesogenic conditions in claims data, and how are trends in these conditions related to enrollee characteristics? Below is a description of our main findings for each of t he studies. Project #1: \"How have opioid prescribing patterns changed over time and what factors predict opioid misuse?\" Characteristics and utilization patterns were examined for adolescent (age 12 to 18) ALL Kids enrollees with new opioid prescrip tions between 1999 and 2015. 50,385 incident opioid prescriptions with 6 months of prior enrollment without any opioid claims and 6 months of continuous follow -up enrollment were identified. It was found that: o Opioid users tend to be older, female , white and non -urban residents. CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2018 55 o Almost 4% of new opioid users were treated for a mental health disorder in the prior 6 months and 0.5% had a claim for a substance use disorder Notable trends in prescribing characteristics during study period: Increase in mean initial days supplied from 3.91 to 4.8 Increase in % with >7 days supplied from 4.7% to 10.7% Increased use of oxycodone and Tramadol over time Decline in dosing (MME/day) in recent years (2012 -2015) Significant g rowth in % of opioids prescribed by oral surgeons Initial days supplied associated with persistent use measure: o Prescriptions in excess of 4 days are associated with increase in long -term use. Decline in persistent use over time, most n otable in 2012 -2015 period Persistent use is greater among older enrollees and females, less common among minorities. Poor health status is associated with increased probabilities of persistent use Higher rate of drug overdose among opioid prescribed patients with underlying mental health conditions. Project #2: What are the determinants and consequences of high quality follow -up care after a mental health hospitalization? The Child Core Set measure for follow -up care following a mental health hospitalization between 2012 -2016 was calculated. 1,444 hospitalizations among 1,175 enrollees met CMS criteria for inclusion in measure calculation. Among the hospitalizations, 395 (27.4%) received follow -up within 7 days and 656 (45.4%) within 30 days. Increasing the time window to 45 or 60 day s, or including primary care providers, resulted in modest increases in receipt of follow -up care. Specific factors associated with increased follow -up: Primary diagnosis of depression Residing in a small rural area or in the third quartile of mental health providers in area Specific factors associated with decreased follow -up Having a hospitalization in 2012 Black enrollees Male enrollees Other notable findings: Adjusted models estimate consistent statistically sig nificant associations with year and primary diagnosis. In general, follow -up among enrollees is consistent with other CHIP and Medicaid programs but could be improved. Follow -up may reduce future mental health hospitalizations, but after contro lling for other factors, the association is weak and not statistically significant at conventional levels. Project #3: \"How did a large copayment increase impact ED utilization overall and for low -severity conditions?\" The impact of June 2012 increase in copayments for ED visits was examined: Large increase for fee -group and expansion enrollees (from $15 to $60). vs. low -fee enrollees whose copayments only rose from $5 to $6. Difference -in-difference design to assess impact Examine probability of visits of varying severity at person -month level Use Wharam modification of NYU algorithm to categorize visit severity Unadjusted rates of ED use declined following copayment increase: CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2018 56 There were larger reductions in monthly probability of ED visit for expansion ( -0.27) and fee ( - 0.21) enrollees than for low -fee enrollees ( -0.14). There was a similar pattern for low -severity and injury visits. Difference -in-difference estimates of decline in ED utilization: A delayed impact of copayment increase on utilization was observed. There were statistically significant declines in \"late period\" (>7 months after copayment increase. Expansion enrollees experienced statistically significant reductions in overall ( -0.20), low severity ( -0.07) and injury ( -0.06) visits relative to low -fee enrollees after the copayment change. The observed large effects of copayment increase on expansion vs. fee enrollees - could reflect more savvy behavior of higher S ES group. Project #4: \"How prevalent are obesogenic conditions in claims data and how are trends in these conditions related to enrollee characteristics?\" The analysis examined trends in prevalence of six claims -based obesogenic conditions: Obe sity Hypertension Pre -diabetes Diabetes Hyperlipidemia Obstructive sleep apnea. The study showed very low prevalence of obesogenic conditions in claims data relative to estimates of obesity prevalence in children from other sour ces: Overall prevalence increased from 1.3% in 1999 to 2.5% in 2005 Larger growth among enrollees over age 5 and with at least one well -visit. There was larger growth over time in obesogenic diagnoses for minorities and low -income enrollees Consistent with under -diagnosis among disadvantaged populations. Costs were higher for individuals with obesogenic diagnosis: There was approxim ately 30% higher growth in spending among enrollees with obesogenic conditions.

How have you redirected/changed your outreach strategies during the reporting period? [7500] Outreach strategies remained the same this reporting period as they were the previous reporting period. Alabama CHIP participated in professional association conferences within the state to provide education to our partners and communities regarding Alabama CHIP. Throughout the year, Alabama CHIP also sent applications and brochures to schools, agencies, community partners and families in Alabama. 2. What methods have you found most effective in reaching low -income, uninsured children (e.g., T.V., school outreach, word -of-mouth)? How have you me asured effectiveness? [7500] As in previous reporting periods, word of mouth remains the best method for many families to learn about Alabama CHIP. Many of Alabama CHIP's partners continue to be a good resource in assisting in reaching low -income and unin sured children in Alabama. No formal evaluation of outreach methods has been conducted. 3. Which of the methods described in Question 2 would you consider a best practice(s) ? [7500] Word of mouth and community partner education remain the best methods in reaching low income underinsured children in Alabama. 4. Is your state targeting outreach to specific populations (e.g., minorities, immigrants, and children living in rural areas)? Yes No Have these efforts been successful, and how have you measured effectiveness? [7500] 5. What percentage of children below 200 percent of the f ederal poverty level (FPL) who are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP have been enrolled in those programs? [5]96.2 (Identify the data source used).

Conducts follow -up with clients through caseworkers/outreach w orkers Sends renewal reminder notices to all families How many notices are sent to the family prior to disenrolling the child from the program? [500] 2 At what intervals are reminder notices sent to families (e.g., how many weeks before the end of the current eligibility period is a follow -up letter sent if the renewal has not been received by the state?) [500] ALL Kids families receive a renewal packet two months prior to the date of renewal as well as an additional reminder letter 30 days prior to the renewal date. Other, please explain: [500] In addition to mailing renewal applications, families have the option to renew online or by fax. 3. Which of the above strategies appear to be the most effective? Have you evaluated the effectiveness of any strategies? If so, please describe the evaluation, including data sources and methodology. [7500] While CHIP has not conducted an evaluation to determine which strategy is the most effective, implem entation of the automated redetermination process (RRV) is likely the most effective retention strategy employed by our state. Anecdotal information shows that offering families the option to pay ALL Kids premiums at anytime during the coverage period is also effective. The online application is also a convenient method for completing renewals. Section IIIC: Subpart B: Eligibility Data Table 1.

Duration Measu re of Selected Children, Ages 0 -16, Enrolled in Title XIX and Ti tle XXI, Second Quarter FFY 2018 The purpose of tables 3a and 3b is to measure the duration, or continuity, of Medicaid and CHIP enrollees' coverage. This in formation is required by Section 402(a) of CHIPRA. Reporting on this table is required. Because the measure is designed to captu re continuity of coverage in title XIX and title XXI beyond one year of enrollment, the measure collects data for 18 months of enrollment. This means that reporting spans two CARTS reports over two years. The duration measure uses a cohort of children an d follows the enrollment of the same cohort of children for 18 months to measure continuity of coverage. States identify a new cohort of children every two years. States identify newly enrolled children in the second quarter of FFY 2018 (January, Februar y, and March of 2018) for the FFY 2018 CARTS report. This same cohort of children will be reported on in the FFY 2019 CARTS report for the 12 and 18 month status of children newl y identified in quarter 2 of FFY 2018 If your eligibility system already has the capability to track a cohort of enrollees over time, an additional \"flag\" or unique identifier may not be necessary. The FFY 2018 CARTS report is the first year of reporting in the cycle of two CARTS reports on the cohort of children identifi ed in th e second quarter of FFY 2018. For the FFY 2018 report, States will only report on lines 1 -4a of the tables. States will continue to report on the same table in the FFY 2019 CARTS report. In the FFY 2019 report, no updates will be made to lines 1 -4a. For th e FFY 2019 report, data will be added to lines 5 -10a.The next cohort of children will be identified in the second quarter of the FFY 2020 (January, February and March of 2020). Instructions: For this measure, please identify newly enrolled children in bo th title XIX (for Table 3a) and title XXI (for Table 3b) in the second quarter of FFY 2018, ages 0 months to 16 years at time of enrollment. Children enrolled in January 2018 must have birthdates after July 2001 (e.g., children must be younger than 16 year s and 5 months) to ensure that they will not age out of the program at the 18th month of coverage. Similarly, children enrolled in February 2018 must have birthdates after August 2001, and children enrolled in March 2018 must have birthdates after Septemb er 2001. Each child newly enrolled during this time frame needs a unique identifier or \"flag\" so that the cohort can be tracked over time. If your eli gibility system already has the capability to track a cohort of enrollees over time, an additional \"flag \" or unique identifier may not be necessary. Please follow the child based on the child's age category at the time of enrollment (e.g., the child's age at enrollment creates an age cohort that does not change over t he 18 month time span). Please enter the data requested in the tables below, and the template will tabulate the percentages. In the FFY 2018 report you will only enter data on line 1 about the total children newly enrolled, and lines 2 -4a related to the 6 -month enrollment status of children identified on line 1. Line 1 should be populated with data on the children newly -enrolled in January, February, and March 2018. Lines 2 -4a of the tables should also be populated with information about these same children 6 months later (as of June 2018 f or children first identified as newly enrolled in January 2018, as of July 2018 for children identified as newly enrolled in February 2018, and as of August 2018 for children identified as newly enrolled in March 2018). Only enter a \"0\" (zero) if the data are known to be zero. If data are unknown or unavailable, leave the field blank. Note that all data must sum correctly in order to save and move to the next page. The data in each individual row must add across to sum to the total in the \"All Children Ages 0 -16\" column for that row. And in each column, the data within each time period (6, 12 and 18 months) must each sum up to the data in row 1, which is the numbe r of children in the cohort. This means that in each column, rows 2, 3 and 4 must sum to the total in row 1; rows 5, 6 and 7 must sum to the row 1; and rows 8, 9 and 10 must sum to row 1. These tables track a child's enrollment status over time, so for da ta reported at each milestone (6, 12, and 18 months), there should always be the same total number of children accounted for. That is, regardless of how the e nrollment numbers are distributed between line 2 -10 in the continuously enrolled, break in covera ge but re -enrolled, and disenrolled categories and across the age category columns at each time period, the total number of children accounted for in each time period should add up to the number in line 1, co lumn 2 \"All Children Ages 0 -16.\" CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2018 65 Rows numbered w ith an \"a\" ( e.g., rows 3a and 4a) are excluded from the totals because they are subsets of their respective rows.

Cost sharing is tracked by: Enrollees (shoebox method) If the state uses the shoebox method, please describe informational tools provided to enrollees to track cost sharing. [7500] Families are informed at enrollment, via a guidebook, that they have an out -of-pocket maximum of 5% of the family income as reported on the most recent application. The guidebook states, \"It is your responsibility t o keep your receipts and contact us [ALL Kids] when you are close to spending your annual out -of-pocket maximum.\" Health Plan(s) State Third Party Administrator N/A (No cost sharing required) Other, please explain. [7500] 2. When the family reaches the 5% cap, are premiums, copayments and other cost sharing ceased? Yes No 3. Please describe how providers are notified that no cost sharing should be charg ed to enrollees exceeding the 5% cap. [7500] Providers may access online benefit information for enrollees to obtain cost -sharing information. Additionally, enrollees who have met the out -of-pocket expense maximum are issued new insurance cards on which t he words \"NO FEE\" are printed. 4.

[7500] This past year, one of the studies conducted by researchers at the UAB School of Public Health in collaboration with colleagues at Indiana University -Indianapolis and Texas A&M, assessed how a large copayment increase in June 2012 impact emergency department (ED)utilization overall and for low -severity conditions among separate CHIP enrollees. In this study, multiple identification strategies to examine the efficacy o f larger copayments in reducing ED utilization among publicly insured children were used. Overall, the difference -in- difference and segmented regression models yield qualitatively similar results, with the increase in copayments for fee/expansion enrollees associated with 5 -10% reductions in the probability of an ED visit in a given month. For the 44,713 fee and expansion enrollees in July 2013, the 0.13 - 0.20 reduction in ED visits associated the copayment increase imply a reduction of 58 -89 ED CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2018 73 visits month ly.

With regard to fraud and abuse within the provider se ctor, CHIP contracts with BCBSAL, its sole health plan administrator, to prevent fraud and abuse, and investigate cases of suspected fraud and abuse. Complaints of fraud and abuse in the applicant enrollment process are addressed on a case by case basis, as these occur very infrequently and usually each case has its own unique circumstances. When a case is referred to ALL Kids, the complaint is received and initial, internal research on the applicant or enrollee is conducted by the ALL Kids Program Integri ty Unit. This research is conducted within a ten business day time period. Some suspected fraud and abuse cases are subject to a committee type review by the Director of Program Integrity, Director of Program Operations and Professional Services Division, Director of Program Services, and/or the Director of the Eligibility Unit. The office of ADPH General Counsel is involved as needed. There are several general steps which are relevant to each case investigated: 1. Conduct research in the CHIP Eligibilit y System to determine eligibility standards to enroll the applicant/enrollee. 2. Review the most current application on file. 3. Review the MSIQ Medicaid database for any applicable information. 4. Complete a summary of events to include complete names and dates. 5. Maintain a file of complaints received by fiscal year.

[7500] CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2018 86 Section V: Program Challenges and Accomplishments 1. For the reporting period, please provide an overview of your state's political and fiscal environment as it relates to health care for low income, uninsured children and families, and how this environment impacted CHIP. [7500] For FY 2018, Alabama CHIP re ceived 100% federal funding. Therefore, the fiscal environment of the state did not have a noticeable impact on the program. 2. During the reporting period, what has been the greatest challenge your program has experienced? [7500] Most of the first qu arter was spent preparing for the possibility of CHIP federal funding ending. The uncertainty of federal funding at the beginning of the fiscal year impacted the program negatively resulting in staff shortages and a hiring freeze. Challenges to fill vaca ncies that resulted persisted throughout most of the reporting period. Continuing to build the joint CHIP -Medicaid eligibility and enrollment system. This system interacts with the Federally Facilitated Marketplace and the Federal Data Hub. To ensure \"n o wrong door\" application processing, eligibility determinations for both ALL Kids and Medicaid continued to be performed by staff in both agencies. Meeting compliance standards for Provider Enrollment (risk -based screening) as mandated by the ACA. Conducting mental health and medical parity analyses for the CHIP State Plan Amendment related to the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. Alabama Medicaid completed a SPA to continue Express -Lane Eligibility for Children which has been very valu able. 3. During the reporting period, what accomplishments have been achieved in your program? [7500] Continuing to add greater functionality to the joint CHIP -Medicaid eligibility and enrollment system and improve reporting of renewal statistics. During the reporting period, AL began implementing the Redetermination and Renewal Verification (RRV) System. This system results in automatic redeterminations and promises to be a very efficient method for renewal and an effective method f or increasing retention. Continued to experience increased enrollment in both the ALL Kids (Alabama's separate CHIP) and in the Medicaid CHIP (MCHIP) populations. CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2018 87 Through changes in the electronic eligibility and enrollment system (CARES), CHIP was a ble to begin testing the functionality of an automated premium payment system for enrollees. This automation allows enrollees to pay their premiums online or over the phone using a credit or debit card. Alabama's CHIP conducted a thorough assessment o f its benefit system allowing for the verification of medical and mental health parity in accordance with the Affordable Care Act. Due to state legislation, CHIP also prepared to add Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy as a benefit for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Alabama Medicaid completed a SPA to continue Express -Lane Eligibility (ELE) for Children which has been very valuable and the state continues to renew title XIX Medicaid children through this ELE data match. 4. What changes hav e you made or are planning to make in your CHIP program during the next fiscal year? Please comment on why the changes are planned. [7500] Alabama's CHIP will continue to enhance and refine the joint CHIP/Medicaid Eligibility and Enrollment System and im prove functionality of the system and to improve services to the citizens of our state. Alabama has begun to explore options, such the possible development of an HSI, directed at decreasing infant mortality. ' Alabama Medicaid is pursuing an 1115 waiver for a new initiative to transform the Medicaid delivery system through a flexible and more cost -efficient effort which builds off the Agency's current case management program structure. The Alabama Coordinated Health Network (ACHN), is an innovative plan t o transform health care provided to Medicaid recipients in Alabama. The proposed program is designed to create a single care coordination delivery system that effectively links patients, providers and community resources in each of seven newly -defined reg ions. Delivery of medical services is not part of this program. No other changes are planned at this time. Enter any Narrative text related to Section V "}
