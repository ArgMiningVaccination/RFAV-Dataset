Besides this, one third of people worldwide have no access to modern medicine and rely only on traditional medicine. To date, drugs of plant origin, or their derivates (paclitaxel, vinblastine, vincristine, vinorelbine, etoposide, camptothecin, topotecan, irinotecan, and omacetaxine), are very important in the therapy of malignancies and they are included in most chemotherapeutic regimes. To date, 391,000 plant and 14,000 mushroom species exist. Their medical and biochemical capabilities have not been studied in detail. In this review, we systematized the information about plants and mushrooms, as well as their active compounds with antitumor properties. Plants and mushrooms are divided based on the regions where they are used in ethnomedicine to treat malignancies. The majority of their active compounds with antineoplastic properties and mechanisms of action are described. Furthermore, on the basis of the available information, we divided them into two priority groups for research and for their potential of use in antitumor therapy. As there are many prerequisites and some examples how THM helps and strengthens modern medicine, finally, we discuss the positive points of THM and the management required to transform and integrate THM into the modern medicine practice.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-07-14", "cleaned_text": "How Should the Worldwide Knowledge of Traditional Cancer Healing Be Integrated with Herbs and Mushrooms into Modern Molecular Pharmacology? on 16 February 2022). Thus, this continuous challenge forces scientists to search for new antineoplastic drugs and approaches, and investigate their combinations, to better fight various types of malignancies. [https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs); accessed on 16 February 2022). Twenty-six of them ( [Table S1](#app1-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)) are natural compounds derived from plants, actinomycetes, and marine organisms, or semi-synthetic derivates of these compounds. Despite the fact that this number does not look impressive, these compounds constitute the most frequently used most chemotherapeutic regimes ( [Table S2](#app1-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)) and have made a key impact on the chemotherapeutic cancer treatment. The chemical manipulation of these compounds continues to create new improved drugs. [1](#B1-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Under these circumstances of economic disparity, people from poor countries have no other choice but to rely on traditional medicine, which represents empirically collected evidence over many hundreds of years. Firstly, traditional medicine relies on the application of plants which are reservoirs of thousands of biologically active compounds. Thus, different cultures have adapted to use certain plants in their region to treat a spectrum of illnesses, including malignancies. [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [3](#B3-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. A part of this system is associated with medical plants. Ayurvedic formulations are often complex and consist of several herbal-mineral ingredients, and are governed by well-described pharmacological principles of preparation, compatibility, and administration. With the support of the Government of India, a book in two parts\u2014Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API)\u2014has been established. Part I (Volumes 1-6) of it contains information about natural substances (medical plants, minerals), whereas part II contains healing formulations which can be created from the constituents described in part I. [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [4](#B4-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. CPM is a modern from of TCM which, due to standardization, can be used in modern medicine [ [6](#B6-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. China's government strongly supports this, exports CMP products to different countries for trials and therapy, and sets up research partnerships with the big international pharmaceutical companies [ [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [9](#B9-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Kampo is mainly based on plant extracts and formulations and is prescribed in line with modern drugs to treat various diseases including cancer and takes part in various clinical evaluations the antineoplastic properties of folk medicine plants and mushrooms; the molecular mechanisms of their bioactive constituents; and the advantages and limitations of using plants, mushrooms, and their active compounds in parallel with modern antineoplastic drugs. 2. Cancer Features Affected by Natural Drugs [Figure 1](#pharmaceuticals-15-00868-f001)) [ [23](#B23-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. It is clear that both the genetic background, and somatic factors including cell-to-cell interactions, immunity, humoral factors, microenvironmental conditions, metabolic alterations, and others, are orchestrated during neoplasia. As a result, the altered balance in the equilibrium between oncogenes and tumor suppressors favors malignization. This disbalance results in uncontrolled cell division, resistance to apoptosis, metabolic rewiring, altered interactions with the microenvironment, as well as the acquisition of the ability to migrate and invade neighboring tissues, induce angiogenesis, evade the immune system, and become resistant to therapeutics, etc. [24](#B24-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. This results in the abnormalities within signaling pathway networks. [25](#B25-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. One of the key roles in malignant cells is occupied by the PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways. Different biological stimuli and other signaling pathways converge on them. Thus, various growth factors, such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF), the fibroblast growth factor (FGF), the insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), bind to and activate their tyrosine kinase receptors which induce the signal transduction following the involvement of PI3K/AKT and ERK/MAPK signaling [ [26](#B26-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [27](#B27-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Thereby, the inhibition of these pathways is usually associated with the attenuation of tumor growth, migration, invasion, as well as the induction of apoptosis which makes them desirable drug targets. [28](#B28-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. However, autophagy possesses a dual role in cancer. While it may contribute to cell death, it may also have cancer promoting properties including chemoresistance [ [29](#B29-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [30](#B30-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [31](#B31-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [32](#B32-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [33](#B33-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. As an antineoplastic strategy, the use of metabolic inhibitors first started in the 1950s [ [34](#B34-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Now, their use during successful cancer therapies is once again a hot topic for discussion. The metabolic inhibitors which have been used clinically are methotrexate and its analogs, as well as gemcitabine, 5-fluouracil, lonidamine, AZD3965, telaglenastat, and others [ [32](#B32-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Moreover, new drugs have been designed, and preclinical and clinical studies are underway. [35](#B35-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [36](#B36-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. DNA and histone methyl transferases, histone deacetylases, and other chromatin-modifying participants are targets for anti-cancer therapy [ 2 and protein (Mcl-1\u2014venetoclax and navitoclax) [ [42](#B42-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [43](#B43-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Today, it is suggested that malignant cells dwell in hybrid E/M state which allows them to switch between EMT and MET if required [ [43](#B43-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [44](#B44-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The targeting invasive and migration properties of tumor cells is very important for all chemotherapeutic regimes. [45](#B45-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Generally, they are resistant to chemotherapeutics, possess tumor-initiating and metastasis-initiating capacities, and are responsible for tumor recurrence and development [ [46](#B46-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [47](#B47-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [48](#B48-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [49](#B49-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. 3. Plants from Different Continents Used in Ethnomedicine for the Treatment of Malignancies 3.1. Africa [50](#B50-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [51](#B51-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [52](#B52-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] with the richest species diversity maximum in countries of West Sea coast from Gabon to Guinea, South African republic, and Western Africa (spanning Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Ethiopia, and South Sudan) [ [53](#B53-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [54](#B54-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [55](#B55-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated anticancer properties of alcohol and methanol extracts derived from A. nilotica. This plant turned out to be toxic predominantly to a breast cancer model (MCF7) than for normal liver cells [ [56](#B56-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Other researches have shown anticancer activity of this plant against glioblastoma [ [57](#B57-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], colon cancer [ [58](#B58-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], and other types of malignant cell models [ [55](#B55-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [59](#B59-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], as well as [54](#B54-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [61](#B61-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [62](#B62-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Pyrogallol was also shown to be the important anticancer chemical of A. nilotica which was able to strongly reduce colon tumors in mice models [ [58](#B58-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. For all of these individual compounds, the significant anti-neoplastic properties have been senegalensis demonstrated cytotoxic activity rather similar to doxorubicin against a panel of malignant cell models but not to normal hepatocytes [ [65](#B65-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The authors have also demonstrated the significant inhibition of angiogenesis. The study of silver nanoparticles derived from the leaves extract of G. senegalensis has shown a significant antiproliferative effect on human prostate (PC3), breast (MCF7), and liver (HepG2) cell models [ [66](#B66-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [67](#B67-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [68](#B68-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. It has a similar structure to colchicine, and binds tubulin at the same site. Moreover, CA-4 is effective against multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer cells. A comprehensive overview of the structure, probable mechanisms of action, and potential applications is described in this review [ [68](#B68-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [51](#B51-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [69](#B69-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], Central, Eastern, and North Africa [ [ [70](#B70-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [71](#B71-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [72](#B72-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [73](#B73-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [Table 1](#pharmaceuticals-15-00868-t001). [28](#B28-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], the frequency with which different parts of the plant are used for cancer treatment: seeds (27%), hole aerial parts of plants (23%), leaves (22%), followed by roots For sure, the long-standing ethnical knowledge about the use of specific parts of a particular plant may reflect the distribution and amount of biologically active compounds among the plant. As stated by the same authors, the preparation methods for consumption are as follows: decoction (30%), grind with (1%), and inhalation (1%). Diverse types of preparation can be associated with the specific assimilation of biologically active compounds required across the body for treatment certain types of malignancies. 3.2. South America [83](#B83-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] which is approximately 1.6 times more than in Africa. However, the degree of study of their biochemical diversity and antitumor properties is similar to Africa. [84](#B84-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In Brazil, T. impetiginosa is the most used plant to cure neoplasia. The stem bark and/or inner bark of this tree is utilized. It contains iridoid, -lapachone are the most attractive compounds from a medical point of view. [86](#B86-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [87](#B87-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [88](#B88-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [89](#B89-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] for human breast, colon, and hepatic cancer cell models. Lapachone was sold in Brazil by the Pernambuco Pharmaceutical Laboratory (LAFEPE) and used to cure malignancies [91](#B91-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], glycolysis and anabolic capacities. flux biosynthetic [ [92](#B92-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [93](#B93-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. -lapachone inhibited lung metastasis selectively killed NADPH quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1)-overexpressing hepatoma which were accompanied by ROS induction and PARP1 hyperactivation, causing a decrease in NAD+ and ATP levels, as well as a dramatic increase in DNA double-strand break lesions [ [94](#B94-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. NQO1 is a prognostic marker in HCC; it was increased 18-fold in HCC versus normal livers, and its high level predicts poor outcome [ [95](#B95-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [96](#B96-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [89](#B89-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [97](#B97-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]). lapachone nanoparticles which remarkably prolonged its half-life in the body and increased brain intake in order to affect glioma cells. [100](#B100-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. However, further insights into the molecular mechanisms of lapachone anticancer activity are are especially interesting for anticancer therapy. Extracts and individual compounds of Aloe induce cell cycle arrest [ [103](#B103-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [104](#B104-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] and apoptosis [ [105](#B105-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], exhibit antiangiogenic and antimetastatic [ [105](#B105-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [106](#B106-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], and decrease glucose flux and telomerase activity in a huge number of studies (including both solid and blood neoplasia) [ [107](#B107-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [108](#B108-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. A comprehensive review of anticancer properties of Aloe vera, A. arborescence, and its active compounds is given in [ [108](#B108-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [109](#B109-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]). The treatment of colorectal cancer cells with Ae induced ER stress and the activation of key components of the PERK pathway\u2014glucose-related protein 78 (GRP78) and transcriptional factor C/EBP homologous this compound activated MAPK signaling and inhibited Akt/mTOR pathway which led to an increase in ROS and autophagy [ [111](#B111-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [112](#B112-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. G-quadruplexes are specific structures in DNA and RNA which are frequently observed in promotors of proliferation-related genes, chromosome ends, and telomeric regions, and are involved in transcription regulation. Due to the stability of G-quadruplexes and their presence within most human promoters of oncogenes, and at telomeres, G4 structures are promising targets and are currently being tested as a way to block the transcription of oncogenes and telomere elongation in cancer cells [ [113](#B113-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In line with this evidence, other groups have reported that Ae and Ae-8-glucoside are G4-binding ligands, especially for c-KIT and c-Myc oncogenes [ [114](#B114-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [115](#B115-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In line with these data, in gastric cancer, the other group has shown an aloin-mediated inhibition of HMGB1 expression and release, as well as a HMGB1-induced activation of the Akt-mTOR-P70S6K and ERK-P90RSK-CREB signaling pathways [ [116](#B116-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [117](#B117-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [108](#B108-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [118](#B118-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Two other trials have also indicated the potential of Aloe for anticancer therapy [ [119](#B119-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [120](#B120-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [109](#B109-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] whereas aloin is pathway [ [121](#B121-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [122](#B122-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [123](#B123-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. growth factor (VEGF) expression and angiogenesis via the p53-HIF1-VEGF pathway [ [124](#B124-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. It was also shown that capsaicin, in combination with sorafenib, inhibited epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling [ [125](#B125-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. This synergic effect attenuated the growth, migration, and invasion, and also induced apoptosis, in three hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, capsaicin extinguished the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway which induced autophagy (ENOX2) is a direct capsaicin. Authors have shown that capsaicin induces autophagy-related apoptosis in p53-mutant oral carcinoma cells, but only autophagy-dependent cytotoxicity (without apoptosis) in cells with wild-type p53. [128](#B128-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. For instance, high doses of capsaicin activated AMPK, and also induced autophagy, EMT, and chemoresistance [ [129](#B129-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. These contradictions may depend on various factors including both the background of the cells and experimental conditions. While different studies report autophagy as a mechanism of capsaicin-mediated effects [ [129](#B129-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], the opposite results can also be linked to this fundamental process. It is already known that autophagy has a dual role in cancer, creating both pro-survival and antineoplastic effects [ [29](#B29-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Autophagy is typically associated with apoptosis. However, in other cases, it protects cancer cells from chemotherapy [ [130](#B130-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Arguably, the exact effects of capsaicin may depend on whether autophagy plays a pro- or anti-survival role in corresponding malignant cells. [Table 2](#pharmaceuticals-15-00868-t002). 3.3. Asia data obtained showed conflicting results; thus, interest among American scientists towards HHT has significantly weakened, unlike their Chinese colleagues. [144](#B144-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [145](#B145-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Thus, HHT became a part of the standard AML therapy in China [ [143](#B143-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved omacetaxine\u2014a semisynthetic purified HHT derivate for the treatment of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) refractory or intolerance to two or more TKIs [ [146](#B146-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [147](#B147-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. HHT was also shown to decrease p-JAK2, p-STAT5, and p-AKT, which suggests it may be a broad-spectrum PTK inhibitor [ [148](#B148-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Thus, multiple mechanisms of HHT activity may exist. [149](#B149-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [150](#B150-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [151](#B151-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Regarding breast cancer studies, extracts of O. diffusa possessed cytotoxicity towards highly invasive breast cancer cells, but not towards normal cells of different origins. It abrogates the expression of metalloproteinases (MMPs) and inhibit AMPK [ [154](#B154-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [155](#B155-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]). Such a diverse composition of compounds with antineoplastic properties may explain the use of O. diffusa by Chinese people as an anticancer substance for centuries. [156](#B156-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [157](#B157-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], and STAT3 pathways [ [158](#B158-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] is reported. It has also been shown that ursolic acid suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells, but not in non-malignant cells. Ursolic acid also repressed metastasis in both zebrafish and mouse models via the suppression of glycolysis through the activation of SP1/caveolin-1 signaling [ [159](#B159-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Another research group has demonstrated that ursolic acid inhibited energy metabolism. It inhibited Akt which was also associated with decreased HK2, PKM2, ATP, and lactate levels [ [160](#B160-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The derivate of ursolic acid mimics glucose, and competes with it for hexokinase 2 (HK2) binding [ [161](#B161-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [162](#B162-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In gastric cancer, OA was shown to down-regulate glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis through the inhibition of YAP and HIF-1 [ [163](#B163-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], through the purine salvage pathway. It suppressed the purine salvage pathway (PSP), thus interfering with nucleotide synthesis. OA of hypoxanthine-guanine (5'-NT), i.e., two enzymes of PSP [ [167](#B167-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The other group was able to show that OA may suppress angiogenesis in colorectal cancer carthamidin) are thought to be the main compounds that are responsible for anticancer properties of SB. [170](#B170-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], inhibition HCC, scutellarein increased the level of PTEN\u2014a negative regulator of Akt signaling pathway [ [173](#B173-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [174](#B174-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In gastric cancer cells, this compound up-regulates PTEN, which attenuates p-PI3K and EMT [ [167](#B167-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [175](#B175-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], as well as the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway [ [176](#B176-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. It may also attenuate the PI3K/AKT pathway, inhibit ABC transporters, and restore susceptibility to 5-FU [ [177](#B177-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. 3.3.1. [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. This statistical analysis has shown that TPMs are used with about the same frequency as western therapeutics, whereas the cost per patient was lower for TPMs. It is interesting to note that different TPMs can be applied to treat certain types of malignancy with varying frequencies. Moreover, TPMs are often applicated in combination with western medicines [ [5](#B5-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The most frequently used antineoplastic formulations are given in [Table 3](#pharmaceuticals-15-00868-t003)with brief descriptions. 3.3.2. Ayurvedic Medicine [197](#B197-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Ayurveda attracts attention in other regions and countries, including the USA and Europe, as an alternative medical way for health recovery and maintenance [ [198](#B198-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [199](#B199-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [200](#B200-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Thus, Ayurveda accounts a few dozen plants with anticancer properties [ [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [197](#B197-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [201](#B201-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Some of them have been also used in TCM and elsewhere, so they were described earlier. Several other very important anticancer ayurvedic plants are discussed below. [202](#B202-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [203](#B203-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The extracts of Ashwagandha selectively killed cancer cells and inhibited xenograft's growth [ [204](#B204-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [205](#B205-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] through mitochondria-dependent apoptosis and G2/M cell cycle arrest. In other studies, extracts of WS suppressed the growth of malignant cell models and xenografts of breast, prostate, lung, gastrointestinal cancer, glioma, etc. This was associated with of FOXO3a/Par4 [ [208](#B208-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The antineoplastic activity of WS is significantly associated with steroidal A. [209](#B209-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [210](#B210-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]). [211](#B211-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Withaferin A inhibited glycolysis and complex III of the respiratory chain in breast cancer mouse models, indicating that it can interfere with metabolic rewiring in neoplasms [ [212](#B212-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. A couple of studies reported that withaferin A can effectively target cancer stem cells (CSCs) [ [213](#B213-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [214](#B214-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [215](#B215-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In addition, C. longa is another species of the Curcuma genus that contains a diverse composition of volatile (zingiberone, tumerone, and atlantone) compounds with a set of biological activities, including anticancer activity (reviewed in [ [216](#B216-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]). [217](#B217-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Curcumin acts through the modulation of multiple signaling pathways. It is known to inhibit the activity of transcriptional factors (STATs, Notch-1, in various malignancies, including melanoma, gastric cancer [ [222](#B222-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], and glioma [ [223](#B223-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. It may also target CSCs in esophageal carcinoma [ [224](#B224-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], hepatocellular carcinoma [ [225](#B225-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], and glioma [ [223](#B223-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Curcumin cells synergistically suppressed TGF--induced EMT invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma [ [238](#B238-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [239](#B239-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [240](#B240-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In addition, both ginger extract and its isolated constituencies were shown to overcome methotrexate [ [241](#B241-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] and dodetaxel resistance [ [247](#B247-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), responsible for Boswellia's antineoplastic properties [ [246](#B246-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [249](#B249-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. A study on the cytotoxicity of oleo gum resin fractions revealed anticancer activity at the IC50 levels even lower than for doxorubicin and 5-fluouracil [ [250](#B250-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [251](#B251-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The cytotoxicity was other key signaling mediators. [254](#B254-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] have shown that BAs may induce epigenetic alterations by modulating DNA methylation. The authors have shown that, in CRC cell lines, there was a modest increase in genome-wide DNA demethylation. This resulted in the re-expression of SAMD14 and co-suppressor genes SMPD3, as well as in the inhibition of DNMT activity. In line with this evidence, Mazzio and colleagues [ [255](#B255-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] have carried out transcriptomic profiling of TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells treated with Boswellia serrata or 3-O-acetyl-B-boswellic acid. They found that this treatment elicits the activation of several key components of the PERK pathway (unfolded protein response (UPR))\u2014PERK, CHOP, GADD34, and ATF3), the induction of tumor suppressor genes and mTOR inhibitors (e.g., sestrin 2 (SESN2)), and Tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3). On the contrary, this treatment inhibited the hyaluronan binding (CEMIP) of oncogenes, transglutaminase 2 (TG2), and SRY box 9 (SOX9) which was associated with cell death induction. [256](#B256-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Numerous semisynthetic BAs have been developed with very good cytotoxicity [ [257](#B257-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [258](#B258-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Using the same breast cancer cell model and mouse xenografts, other authors have shown that xanthatin inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), reducing density, and tumor growth also suppressed NSCLC by transcription factors [ [261](#B261-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [262](#B262-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [263](#B263-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In colon cancer cells, xanthatin similarly stopped cells in G2-M. It elevated ROS, autophagy, and apoptotic response [ [264](#B264-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], [268](#B268-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [269](#B269-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [270](#B270-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In addition, other plants and their active substances with emerging antitumor activities have recently been identified [ [271](#B271-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [272](#B272-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], which indicates that there are many such plants that have not yet been discovered. [2](#B2-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. 3.4. Europe [273](#B273-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. HP is effective against inflammation and urinary cystitis. production [ [277](#B277-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. It also reduces ROS [ [278](#B278-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] and genotoxic stress [ [279](#B279-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. These, and other, properties of HP protect from carcinogenesis [ [274](#B274-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [274](#B274-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]). Hyperforin inhibited EGFR/ERK/NF-B [ It suppressed antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and and [ [284](#B284-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [274](#B274-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [285](#B285-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [286](#B286-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In view of HP's inclusion in European Pharmacopeia and standardization opportunities, it can be considered a potential anti-neoplastic substance. [287](#B287-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [288](#B288-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. It dampens and JNK signaling pathways [ [289](#B289-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Guo and colleagues have shown that mTOR signaling was targeted by BA which initiated apoptosis [ [290](#B290-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In turn, another group has demonstrated that BA suppressed p-AKT and mTOR while inducing autophagy [ [291](#B291-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Apparently, this autophagic response can mitigate BA-induced mitochondria-dependent cell death [ [292](#B292-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [293](#B293-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. It is important to note that BA attenuates the expression of multidrug resistance proteins P-gp, BCRP, and ABCB5, hence decreasing mediated by mutant EGFR [ [294](#B294-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [295](#B295-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [296](#B296-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. This set of chemicals mediate a huge of beneficial pharmacological properties, including antitussive, expectorant, immunomodulator, antineoplastic capabilities. [297](#B297-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In lung cancer cell models, ISL inhibited proliferation by interfering with AKT/mTOR [ [298](#B298-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] AKT/mTOR, MAPK/ERK, actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion complexes, facilitating migration and invasion [ [300](#B300-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In renal carcinoma cells, ILS down-regulates Jak2/STAT3 and MDM2 ubiquitin ligase. MDM2 possesses oncogenic properties, i.e., the main negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor [ [301](#B301-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], as well as through various p53-independent ways [ [302](#B302-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [303](#B303-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. ISL treatment of melanoma cells decreased miR-301b and recovered its target leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domains 1 (LRIG1) which down-regulates tumor growth [ [304](#B304-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [297](#B297-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [297](#B297-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]). This, together with the safety of GG, which is proven by centuries of use, makes this plant a very promising candidate for anticancer therapy studies. [305](#B305-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [306](#B306-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In the oral cancer models, sylimarin induced the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, decreased tumor volumes, and prolonged mouse lifespan [ [307](#B307-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In human colorectal cancer cells, silymarin may down-regulate the Silibinin suppressed of human gastric cancer cells by down-regulating MAPK signaling. In the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231, this compound also reduced the TGF--mediated expression of fibronectin and metalloproteinases MMP2, xenograft models [311](#B311-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. hepatocellular carcinoma models, the combination of silibinin with sorafenib was demonstrated to down-regulate Akt-STAT3 Krueppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) [ [312](#B312-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [313](#B313-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]). This obstacle, in light of its anti-neoplastic and hepatoprotective capabilities, as well as the presence of standardization, makes silymarin the excellent candidate for cancer treatment, especially for hepatocarcinoma. [Table 4](#pharmaceuticals-15-00868-t004). 3.5. North America [328](#B328-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Ginseng is characterized by the presence of ginsenosides, which are ginsengs triterpenes saponins (Rx), considered to be the main bioactive compounds of ginseng. They are also metabolized by the gut microbiota to undergo sequential de-glycosylation and are finally converted to prosaposin or sapogenins within the human body. Based on the structure of aglicon, Rx may be divided into activity of SRC and PI3K kinases. This led to the inactivation of Akt and ERK pathways and lung cancer suppression [ [332](#B332-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In patient-derived xenograft mouse models and glioblastoma stem cell lines, ginsenosids Rg3 and Rh2 suppressed cell viability and the self-renewal capacity of GSCs via the inhibition of the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway [ [333](#B333-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo models, Rg3 treatment reduced the levels of vasculogenic mimicry, matched with the decrease MMP-9 mRNA data surveys, Rh1, Rh2, and Rg3 have strong anti-cancer activities. Because of a number of biologically active compounds identified, as well as FDA-reported safety concerns, Panax-standardized plant material and ginsenosides are promising candidates for anti-neoplastic adjuvant therapy. [Table 5](#pharmaceuticals-15-00868-t005). 3.6. Australia [345](#B345-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [346](#B346-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] which belongs to the family of ATP-binding cassette proteins. BCRP mediates multidrug resistance and promotes an efflux of such as methotrexate, irinotecan, topotecan, [Table 6](#pharmaceuticals-15-00868-t006). Thereby, Australian plants are extremely unstudied to date in terms of antitumor properties. 4. Mushrooms [354](#B354-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Interest in mushrooms as a medical supply is rooted in the mists of time and prevails to these days. Mushrooms are used in the traditional medicine of China, Ayurveda, East Asia, Europe, South America, etc. A number of mushroom species are implicated as food supplements to improve health in different regions, including the USA and Europe. Several big company sale food supplements contain, or are fully derived from, mushrooms. For instance, iHerb (USA, California, [www.iherb.com](http://www.iherb.com); accessed on 30 March 2022), Fungi Perfecti (USA, Olympia, [www.fungi.com](http://www.fungi.com); accessed on 30 March 2022), Ommushrooms (USA, Carlsbad, [www.ommushrooms.com](http://www.ommushrooms.com); on 30 March 2022), Republic, Praha, [https://www.terezia.eu/en/](https://www.terezia.eu/en/); accessed on 30 March 2022), Realmushrooms (Canada, Roberts Creek (BC), [www.realmushrooms.com/](http://www.realmushrooms.com/); accessed on 30 March 2022), Time Health (UK, [www.timehealth.co.uk](http://www.timehealth.co.uk); accessed on 30 March 2022), Zipvit (UK, Staffordshire, [https://www.zipvit.co.uk/](https://www.zipvit.co.uk/); accessed on 30 March 2022), Hangzhou Molai Biotech Co., Ltd.

(China, Shaanxi, [www.shineherb.en.made-in-china.com](http://www.shineherb.en.made-in-china.com); accessed on 30 March 2022) are among them. The main mushrooms which are explored by humans as beneficial for health are reishi, cordyceps, turkey tail, maitake, lion's mane, chaga, and others. [355](#B355-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Mushrooms display a great number of secondary metabolites with different biological activities [ [356](#B356-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [357](#B357-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [358](#B358-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In addition, these metabolites are different from secondary metabolites of plants. Regarding cancer healing, mushroom and fungi, in general, as well as their biochemical diversity, are almost fully unexplored to date. [359](#B359-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [359](#B359-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [355](#B355-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [360](#B360-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Other researchers have shown the direct cytotoxic effects of fruit bodies, but not mycelia extract, on MCF7 cells, with far less significant cytostatic effects on fibroblasts [ [361](#B361-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [362](#B362-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. It also sensitized bladder cancer to gemcitabine [ [363](#B363-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] and gastric cancer cells to docetaxel and cisplatin [ [364](#B364-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Lentinan increased the sensitivity hepatoma cells and xenograft H22-bearing mice to oxaliplatin, which was associated with NF-kb, STAT3, and surviving suppression [ [365](#B365-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [366](#B366-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [367](#B367-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In IFN- and IL-12, whereas Th2 is characterized by IL-4 and IL-10 production and may promote malignization [ [372](#B372-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [373](#B373-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [374](#B374-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The G/L ratio (neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio) is suggested as a prognostic marker, and is associated with an increased tumor progression, invasion, and shortened survival in different types of malignancies including gastric cancer [ [375](#B375-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [376](#B376-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Solid tumors express granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) which induces the proliferation of leukocytes (neutrophils) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Both of them suppress the proliferation of lymphocytes and lymphocyte-activated tumor cells killing those which favor malignization [ [377](#B377-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Lentinan was shown to decrease the G-CSF serum level and inhibited MDSCs via a CARD9-NF-B-Ido pathway which may be responsible for a decrease in the G/L ratio and partially responsible for anticancer properties [ [378](#B378-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [379](#B379-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [379](#B379-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. This was accompanied by the shift of Tregs status from Th2 to Th1, in accordance with the elevation of IFN-, TNF-, and IL-12. [380](#B380-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Lentinan also increased the lifespan of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma [ [381](#B381-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] and improved the quality of life of patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer [ [382](#B382-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [371](#B371-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. A number of studies demonstrated that lentinan improved a patient's survival rate, seemingly irrespective of the tumor type [ [374](#B374-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [383](#B383-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [384](#B384-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Moreover, reishi is a part of adjuvant therapy of cancer and diabetes. [385](#B385-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The in vitro model has also proven the reishi-mediated suppression of protein synthesis and proliferation, whereas it was not toxic to non-tumor breast MCF10A cell lines [ [386](#B386-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The Gl extract was able to attenuate lamellipodia formation, thus inhibiting the motility of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. This was associated with a reduction in Rac kinase activity, as well as p-FAK (Tyr925), Cdc42, and [ [387](#B387-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [388](#B388-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The activity of reishi is manifested as both direct cytotoxicity to cancer cells or indirect cytotoxicity through the stimulation of the immune system [ [389](#B389-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [390](#B390-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. It is proposed that GA targets several receptors (IGFR-1, VEGFR-1 and -2, and ER) [ [391](#B391-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] and is shown to inhibit the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway [ [392](#B392-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], induce DNA damage [ [393](#B393-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], down-regulate MMP-2 and -9 [395](#B395-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. GLP inhibited autophagic colorectal cells [ [396](#B396-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [397](#B397-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] and suppressed \"aerobic glycolysis\" (the down-regulated TF Slug, and also inhibited the JAK/STAT5 pathway, motility, and the invasion of ovarian cancer cells [ [399](#B399-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Water-soluble glucose-enriched Gl polysaccharide attenuated the activation of EGFR and Akt, suppressed oral cancer cells, and sensibilized them to cisplatin, while protecting normal human oral epithelial cells from cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity [ [400](#B400-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [401](#B401-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. GLP increased the proliferation and differentiation of B-lymphocytes, the activity of T-lymphocytes, and their IFN- production [ [402](#B402-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. It increased several-fold the number of natural killer (NK) cells [ [403](#B403-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], and also increased the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating [405](#B405-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [406](#B406-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [407](#B407-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. An evaluation of 120 breast and lung cancer patients whose treatment was supplemented or not with Gl revealed the reverse correlation between Gl intake and immunosuppressive factors COX2 and TGF-1 and positive correlation with anticancer IL-12 [ [408](#B408-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [389](#B389-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. It deserves more attention as a potential adjuvant. [409](#B409-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. For medical usage, in most cases, the so-called \"D-Fraction\" is prepared via extraction from fruit bodies. In this way, D-fraction is a standardized form of protein-bound -glucans (proteoglucans) extracted from the fruit bodies of maitake. It predominantly contains -d-glucans with -(16) main chains and -(14) branches, as well as more common -(13) main chains and -(16) branches [ [410](#B410-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [411](#B411-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [412](#B412-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In the corresponding xenograft mouse model, D-fraction also inhibited tumor growth and metastasis. [413](#B413-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The Konno group demonstrated the strong synergistic cytotoxicity of D-fraction combined with vitamin C on prostate and renal cancer cells [ [414](#B414-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [415](#B415-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [416](#B416-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The other group has shown a long-term immunity activation in MM46-bearing C3H/HeN mice which was associated with an increase in TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and macrophage-derived interleukin (IL)-12, as well as the activity of NK cells [ [417](#B417-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Furthermore, D-fraction combined with vitamin C increased the percentage of CD4 + CD8 + T-cells, B-cells, and [419](#B419-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [420](#B420-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [421](#B421-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. At the same time, there was only a 10-20% improvement for leukemia, stomach cancer, and brain cancer patients. In another investigation, D-fraction increased NK cell activity, attenuated metastatic progress, and improved the expression of tumor markers in all examined patients [ [422](#B422-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [423](#B423-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [424](#B424-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The known bioactive compounds of and polysaccharides [ to suppress KRAS-driven colorectal cancer by attenuating the RAS/ERK pathway [ [428](#B428-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Another study reported that the Cm extract overcame cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cell lines when proteomic profile analysis revealed H-Ras down-regulation [ [429](#B429-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Other authors have demonstrated that its extract down-regulated hedgehog signaling in NSCLCs via suppression [ [431](#B431-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Adenosine receptors are in the family of G-protein-coupled receptors, which are found in almost all human body tissues and organs. Specific ligands, agonists, or antagonists activate these receptors which modulate tumor growth via a range of signaling pathways [ [432](#B432-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [433](#B433-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [434](#B434-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), suppressed focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activation which plays an -9, and PARP cleavage in renal, colon, bladder, lung, breast, prostate, glioblastoma cancer, and leukemia. This compound inhibited cell cycle, motility, invasion, and vascularization, while inducing apoptosis (reviewed in [ [431](#B431-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [438](#B438-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]). One more mechanism has been proposed for cordycepin neoplastic activity. It activates death receptors (DRs) which induce extrinsic apoptotic pathways [ [439](#B439-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [440](#B440-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. With respect model, cordycepin suppressed FGFs/FGFRs pathways, ERK1/2, [443](#B443-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [444](#B444-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [445](#B445-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Thus, cordyceps are able to strengthen the immune system, which is an additional bonus for cancer therapy. [446](#B446-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [447](#B447-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. It likely enters the cells by binding the solute carrier family 22, member 4 (SLC22A4), which is an organic cation carrier. Although there is not enough information about the role of ergothioneine in human physiology, there are strong evidences about its protective properties in our organism [ [447](#B447-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Ergothioneine mitigated oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy in rats (Nishida 2018), provoked necroptosis in colorectal cancer cells [ [448](#B448-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], and favored adjuvant vaccine cancer immunotherapy by suppressing the function of tumor-associated macrophages [ [449](#B449-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The blood level of ergothioneine was negatively associated with the risk of cardiometabolic disease and mortality [ [450](#B450-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)], as well as chronic peripheral neuropathy upon inotodiol- and trametenolic-acid-enriched fractions displayed cytotoxicity. Tramentolic acid was shown to decrease the expression and activity of P-gp, which reverted multidrug resistance in breast cancer cells [ [455](#B455-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [456](#B456-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [457](#B457-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. However, another study has shown that Inonotus polysaccharides directly activate autophagy through LKB1/AMPK, which provoked MMP loss as well as the down-regulation of glycolysis and respiration, and subsequently elicited the death of lung cancer cells both in vitro and in allograft tumor models [ [458](#B458-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [452](#B452-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [459](#B459-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [460](#B460-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [461](#B461-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] and suppressed the migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells through a p53-dependent mechanism [ [462](#B462-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [463](#B463-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]). Hispolon attenuated induced S-phase and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in prostate cancer cells [ [464](#B464-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In melanoma cells, it compromised the activities of mitochondrial respiration complexes I and IV, i.e., the level of Bcl-2, and also increased ROS, nitrite, and lipid peroxide levels [ [465](#B465-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Regarding breast cancer, hispolon, on the contrary, attenuated ROS levels, ERK activity, and the expression of Slug, therefore reversing EMT (Zhao 2016). In another study, hispolon degraded cathepsin S in an autophagy-dependent way which suppressed [ [467](#B467-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]). microtubule and depolymerization induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization, which resulted in the death of cancer but not normal cell lines [ [468](#B468-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Moreover, it synergized with gemcitabine to inhibit cells [ [469](#B469-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [Table 7](#pharmaceuticals-15-00868-t007)and [Table 8](#pharmaceuticals-15-00868-t008)). 5. Why Should Medical Be Used Today? [Tables S1 and S2, Supplementary Materials](#app1-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)). Regarding pharmaceuticals, in the process of its evolution, modern medicine has created a certain set of drugs with a known efficacy, safety, side effects, and known molecular targets. However, it lost a wide profile of pharmacological activity of the plant extracts' initial biological crude material. [Figure 2](#pharmaceuticals-15-00868-f002)). It is interesting to note that, although fungi or their active compounds are not clinically used in the western world today, their known safety and use in clinical practice in China and Japan can lead to an increase in studies on their antineoplastic capabilities. These mushrooms are represented by shiitake, maitake, reishi, and others, and act mainly through the stimulation of the anti-tumor immune system. [481](#B481-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [482](#B482-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In practice, the pharmacokinetics (AUC values) between some herbal extracts and their pure constituents may differ up to 130 times. This phenomenon depends a lot on the pharmacokinetic synergies during intestinal absorption. This means that additional constituents of plant and mushroom extracts increase solubility, reduce first-pass elimination mediated by drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug efflux transporters (ABC transporters), and enhance the membrane permeability of enterocytes (reviewed in [ [482](#B482-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]). [483](#B483-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The antimalaria agent, artemisinin, which is one of the most important natural drugs, is a substrate of cytochrome P450 enzymes. Artemisia annua hepatic P450 and doubles the [Table 8](#pharmaceuticals-15-00868-t008)). The chemical structures of active compounds with their sources are demonstrated in [Figure S1](#app1-pharmaceuticals-15-00868). 6. Limitations of Using Plants and Mushrooms as Medicine 6.1. Bioavailability [487](#B487-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [482](#B482-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. These enzymes are active in both hepatocytes and enterocytes. [488](#B488-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. To challenge this, chemical modifications of natural molecules can be carried out to improve them. However, after chemical modifications, this molecule will not be natural anymore, but rather will become a new compound, which will require new exhaustive preclinical studies. [488](#B488-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [489](#B489-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. SMEDDS are isotropic mixtures of co-surfactants and co-solvents [ [488](#B488-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [490](#B490-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. To avoid drug precipitation, SMEDDS are supplied with hydrophilic polymers, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. The use of SMEDDSs significantly improved the stability, effectiveness, and Cmax and AUC [491](#B491-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Their effectiveness has been demonstrated regarding silibinin. In prostate cancer patients, phytosomes were able to increase the Cmax of silibinin by up to 100 uM, with an average concentration of 1.2 uM at the end of the trial [ [492](#B492-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [493](#B493-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [494](#B494-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Thymoquinone-loaded phytosomes exhibited cytotoxic effects [ [495](#B495-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [487](#B487-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [496](#B496-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [497](#B497-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]). [488](#B488-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [498](#B498-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. This compound inhibits As reported, other inhibitors of CYP and UGT isoforms -mangostin, magnobol, pterostilbene, silybin, gallic acid ester, and others (reviewed in [ [499](#B499-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]). 6.2. Safety [500](#B500-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. However, in some cases, drugs which are not approved by the FDA and EMS can be registered in certain countries. [501](#B501-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [109](#B109-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] and may even induce the Wnt/-catenin pathway which may be associated with potential carcinogenesis [ [121](#B121-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Moreover, there are media stories (e.g., [https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-45971416](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-45971416); accessed on 20 February 2022) and scientific reports [ [502](#B502-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [503](#B503-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [504](#B504-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] about serious hepatotoxicity in people who consumed excessive amounts of green tea or used its extract as a food supplement. The green-tea-induced hepatotoxicity occurs due to the excessive consumption of ()-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGGG). Its consumption safety level was determined by the European Commission [ [503](#B503-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [505](#B505-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [506](#B506-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]). 6.3. Standardization [507](#B507-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Thus, standardization guarantees the content of one or more active constituents and marker compounds. This is closely associated with both efficiency and safety. It includes the evaluation of chemical constituents present in a herbal drug. This may involve the quantification of individual compounds of interest or chemical groups (total phenolics, total triterpenic acids, total alkaloids, and tannins). Standardization may use multiple marker-based fingerprint profiles [ [508](#B508-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. The step-by-step standardization procedure, from primary culturing to the finished herbal product, is described in another review [ [509](#B509-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. [369](#B369-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. 7. Overcoming Limitations to Integrate Folk and Modern Medicine [https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/](https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/); accessed on 26 March 2022). However, in China, both western modern medicine and TCM are officially used today, alone or in combination. One of the reasons is that TCM has proven its effectiveness for 2000 years. Now, China's government strongly supports TCM (in the form of CPM), exporting its products to different countries for trials and therapy, and setting up a research partnership with the big international pharmaceutical companies such as Novartis or Astrazeneca, displaying global ambitions [ [7](#B7-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)] ( [http://www.news.cn/english/2021-10/03/c_1310224791.htm](http://www.news.cn/english/2021-10/03/c_1310224791.htm); accessed on 26 March 2022). The fears of western medicine are related both to the concern about the safety profile, and a possible reduction in the monopoly currently held by large pharmaceutical corporations. Various aspects such as economic and political components, fears, and real examples of insecurity (both related to efficacy and a lack of evidence in various clinical trials) intertwine and both contribute to and hinder TCM's application in developed countries [ [8](#B8-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Nevertheless, TCM actively continues to develop its niche in the modern world's pharmacology. [510](#B510-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. Thus, as demonstrated by China, it is possible to improve traditional medicine like this. [511](#B511-pharmaceuticals-15-00868), [512](#B512-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. In theory, food supplementation with anticancer herbs and mushrooms (e.g., shiitake, reishi, etc.) may help to prevent and reduce tumor growth. Chen and colleagues fed mice with gastric cancer with six medical edible plants used in TCM and observed the suppression of neoplastic growth through several molecular mechanisms [ [512](#B512-pharmaceuticals-15-00868)]. All of the plants used possess well-known anticancer properties. 8. Conclusions and Future Perspectives - - To date, a lot of information about a number of plants and mushrooms, and their individual bioactive compounds with well-documented antitumor properties, has been accumulated. Their respective full-scale multi-level studies should be top priorities. - - Despite there being a lot of investigations on the anticancer properties of a certain plant using tumor cell models, only a limited number of studies have been carried out with implication of control non-tumor cell models and subsequent animal studies. As the next step, comprehensive studies on their effectiveness, toxicity to non-cancer cells, and animal tissues in various doses are required to authorize natural-derived extracts and individual compounds into the next pre-clinical or clinical investigation. - - Progress in standardization is highly required to transform anecdotal folk herbal medicine into modern molecular pharmacology with clear mechanisms of action. This process includes investments into big programs regarding investigations, monitoring, and certifications of manufacturing the final product. - - On the examples of etoposide, irino- and topotecan, vinorelbine, docetaxel, and omacetaxine, the development of semi-synthetic derivates of newly identified natural compounds with significant anticancer properties may improve their characteristics and lead to new antineoplastic drugs. - - The study of a synergistic interaction of isolated natural compounds and crude plant- and mushroom-derived extracts with widely used anticancer therapeutics should help define the right dosage and compatibility between the natural and synthetic therapeutics. - - Natural compounds may sensitize tumors for modern therapeutics and be effective in adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy. - - There is a variety of standardized dietary supplements from plants and mushrooms with presumable antineoplastic properties produced by large world-class companies. The important approach is to test their antitumor potential using animal models, especially in combination with relevant modern therapeutics. - - The pharmacological effects of active compounds are much higher in herbal extracts than in pure compounds due to co-existing constituents which may provide the pharmacokinetic synergy during intestinal absorption and the ''first-path'' metabolism. - - Folk medicine may point to certain plants or mushrooms with highly potent anti-cancer properties and bioactive compounds. Herewith, the cooperation between cancer researchers and ethnobotanists or ethnomedicine specialists can benefit the development of new therapeutics.
