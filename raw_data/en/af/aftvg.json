It is thought the health service spends \u00a34m a year on the controversial alternative treatment - and there are homeopathic hospitals and GPs around the country. But Life Sciences Minister George Freeman said today that cash should only be spent on the most effective medicines. Homeopathy is based on the idea that the body can heal itself through highly diluted substances. It is controversial because experts say there is no evidence that it works. A 2010 House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report said the remedies performed no better than dummy pills, adding homeopathy was underpinned by principles which are 'scientifically implausible'. This is also the view of England's Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies. Homeopathy on NHS prescription could be banned, it was announced today. The news follows a report which argued the treatment is underpinned by principles which are 'scientifically implausible' Mr Freeman said today: 'With rising health demands, we have a duty to make sure we spend NHS funds on the most effective treatments. 'We are currently considering whether or not homeopathic products should continue to be available through NHS prescriptions. We expect to consult on proposals in due course.' A consultation on whether it should continue to be prescribed is expected to take place next year. Homeopathy is a form of complementary, holistic medicine used by more than 200 million people across the world. Advocates advise it is used for both acute and chronic conditions. It is based on the principle of 'like cures like', the British Homeopathic Association states. Therefore the idea is that substances that cause illnesses can become remedies in small, highly diluted doses. The treatment is based on the idea that the body can heal itself through highly diluted substances. It is controversial because experts say there is no evidence that it works Many homeopathic remedies consist of substances that have been diluted many times in water until there is none or almost none of the original substance left. But according to NHS Choices, the NHS website for patients, there has been extensive investigation of its effectiveness. It says: 'There is no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is effective as a treatment for any health condition.' This morning, Simon Singh, a journalist who wrote a book dismissing homeopathy, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'When you look at all the data, when you talk to the editors of the best medical journals, when you talk to the Chief Medical Officer, if you looked at the report from the Commons Select Committee, homeopathy does not work, I'm afraid. 'You will never find a homeopathic drug doping scandal in athletics because all the athletes will get is a sugar rush. WHAT IS HOMEOPATHY? Homeopathy is a form of complementary, holistic medicine used by more than 200 million people across the world. Advocates advise it is used for both acute and chronic conditions. Homeopathic remedies are prepared by taking a substance, plant, animal or chemical material, diluting it in water or alcohol, then forcefully hitting the container against a hand or surface. The medicines come in the form of pellets to be placed under the tongue, tablets, liquids, ointments, sprays and creams. It is based on the principle of 'like cures like', the British Homeopathic Association states. The idea is that substances that cause illnesses can become remedies in small, highly diluted doses. The BHA advises it can be used to treat eczema, depression, coughs, the menopause, chronic fatigue, irritable bowel syndrome, hay fever, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. 'Because the NHS funds it, it gives it undue credibility. These pills typically have nothing in them whatsoever but you will find charities who will send homeopaths to west Africa to treat Ebola, to south Africa to treat malaria.' But Dr Peter Fisher, director of research at the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine, denied homeopathic medicine only had a placebo effect. 'There have been a number of studies - what they call comparative effectiveness studies, in other words you compare GPs who integrate homeopathy in their practice with GPs who do not ... and they are unanimous. All of them show you get better outcomes with homeopathy.' He added: 'The evidence does not support that it is a placebo.' One of homeopathy's biggest advocates is Price Charles. He has long endorsed it and has also had treatment from herbalists and chiropractors for ailments including severe back pain. Earlier this year, the infamous 'spider memos' revealed he lobbied ministers to use more alternative medicine such as homeopathy on the NHS because he 'couldn't bear people suffering unnecessarily'. The Prince told then-health secretary Alan Johnson in September 2007 than an 'anti-homeopathy campaign' was damaging the health service. He said complementary therapies should be used alongside conventional medicine. Explaining this in the letter to Mr Johnson, he said that he 'couldn't bear to see people suffering unnecessarily when a complimentary approach could make the difference', especially with depression, back pain, eczema and irritable bowel syndrome. He said: 'I have been convinced for many years that we in the United Kingdom need to do more to encourage and facilitate good health, as well as to treat illness. 'I am sure that more can be done to take advantage of complementary medicine, not as an alternative or competitor to conventional medicine, but as part of an integrated approach'. The Prince Charles 'spider memos' released earlier revealed he lobbied ministers to use more alternative medicine such as homeopathy on the NHS because he 'couldn't bear people suffering unnecessarily' Charles has long endorsed homeopathy and has had treatment from herbalists and chiropractors for ailments including severe back pain However today's announcement comes after a large report earlier this year warned that homeopathic medicines are 'no more effective than placebo' in treating health problems. The Australian authors warned people who choose homeopathy 'may put their health at risk' if they reject or delay traditional, mainstream treatments. They also advised the alternative medicine is not used to treat health conditions that are chronic, serious, or those that have the potential to become serious. The conclusions were drawn after the The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council report assessed the evidence effectiveness of homeopathy for treating health conditions from a total of 225 existing studies, dating back to 1997. Each was rated by the team from one - very strong - to four - very weak - to determine the research's reliability. The council only used studies which were deemed controlled trials - and therefore included a comparison group who were not given homeopathic treatment. It found there is no conclusive evidence that homeopathy is more effective than placebos in treating patients and easing their symptoms. The council's chief executive, professor Warwick Anderson, said: 'The review shows that there is no good quality evidence to support the claim that homeopathy works better than a placebo. 'People who choose homeopathy may put their health at risk if they reject or delay treatments for which there is good evidence for safety and effectiveness. 'People who are considering whether to use homeopathy should first get advice from a registered health practitioner and in the meanwhile keep taking any prescribed treatments.' Today's announcement comes after a large report earlier this year warned that homeopathic medicines are 'no more effective than placebo' in treating health problems. The Australian authors warned people who choose homeopathy 'may put their health at risk' if they reject or delay traditional, mainstream treatments The researchers found homeopathic treatments were no more effective than sugar pills and other control, pretend medicines to treat asthma, migraines, stress and colds. There were signs it was more effective than placebos for ADHD, bruising, HIV, chronic fatigue, ulcers and depression. But the council concluded the experiments were not carried out properly and the results were not very reliable. For a treatment to be considered effective, the council's Homeopathy Working Committee advised it must result in health improvements that cannot be explained by the placebo effect, and these health improvements must be meaningful for a person's overall health. There must also be evidence that the health improvements in people taking the treatment are unlikely to be due to chance and the result must be seen consistently in several studies, the council's report said. Professor Anderson concluded: 'From this review, the main recommendation is that people should not rely on homeopathy as a substitute for proven, effective treatments. 'This statement was the result of a rigorous examination of the evidence and used internationally accepted methods for assessing the quality and reliability of evidence for determining whether or not a therapy is effective for treating health conditions.'
