It was created by the German physician Samuel Hahnemann in 1796. Its practitioners, homeopaths, believe that any substance that causes disease symptoms in healthy persons can also cure them. This doctrine is similibus curentur or \"like cures like.\" Homeopathic remedies are called remedies. They are prepared using homeopathic dilution. The selected substance is repeatedly diluted until it is chemically indistinguishable from the diluent. Homeopaths might hit the product and shake it to remove any trace of the original meaning. These preparations can be used to treat or cure diseases, according to practitioners. Boron in Homeopathy [Borax](https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/borax-sodium-tetraborate) is also known by the names sodium borate or sodium tetraborate.

Homeopathy is a system of medicine established in the 19th century by a German physician named Samuel Hahnemann. Its basic principles are that \"like treats like\" and \"potentiation through dilution.\" For example, in homeopathy, influenza would be treated with an extreme dilution of a substance that usually causes influenza when taken in high doses. A French physician discovered Oscillococcinum while investigating the Spanish flu in 1917. But he was mistaken that his \"Oscillococcinum\" was the cause of the flu. Practitioners of homeopathy believe that more dilute preparations are more potent. Many homeopathic preparations are so diluted that they contain little or no active ingredient. Therefore, most homeopathic products are not expected to act like drugs or have drug interactions or other harmful effects.
