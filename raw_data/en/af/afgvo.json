The campaign will run for a month starting Aug. 21. Material will appear in multiple languages on radio, TV, online and social media, newspapers and subway and Staten Island Ferry digital screens. \"As a parent I know that this is the time of year for wellness check-ups in preparation for another exciting school year,\" said Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan. \"Let's do whatever we can to keep our kids in school instead of sick at home. Get your child vaccinated to protect our youngsters, their families and the entire school community.\" \"Making sure your young people receive their immunizations not only ensures they can remain in the classroom learning and receiving the critical wraparound supports our schools provide but helps to keep our communities and loved ones safe from potentially dangerous diseases,\" said Schools Chancellor David C. Banks. \"Now is the time to check in with your child's health care provider, and confirm your student has the vaccines they need, so they can start the school year on a healthy and positive note.\" Specific vaccine requirements vary based on a child's age, grade and medical history. All students are required to receive the DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis); poliovirus; MMR (measles-mumps-rubella); varicella and hepatitis B vaccines. Guardians should speak to their doctor if they have any questions.
