What is the updated or bivalent COVID-19 booster? And who is eligible to get one?

Updated COVID-19 boosters became available on: - September 2, 2022, for people aged 12 years and older - October 12, 2022, for people aged 5-11 years - December 9, 2022, for children aged 6 months-4 years who completed the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine primary series When are you up to date?

You do not need to be revaccinated or receive an additional booster. - Vaccines for children are safe and effective. - Vaccination recommendation for everyone ages 6 months through <6 years old is: - Moderna: at least 2 doses, including at least 1 bivalent dose. - Pfizer: - 5 years: 1 bivalent dose. - 6 months through <5 years old: at least 3 doses, including at least 1 bivalent dose. - Vaccination protects you and your child from becoming very ill, being hospitalized, or dying from COVID-19. - The vaccines have gone through the most intensive safety monitoring in US history and are safe and effective for adults and children.
