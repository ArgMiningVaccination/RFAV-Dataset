Population-level data allows us to see where we were and where we are heading, and to set priorities for improvement, drawing on the strengths in our community to promote and protect people's health in Ottawa. This report provides a high-level overview of the health of the population in Ottawa, considering demographic health indicators, social determinants of health, and disease. This report will help: Guide the Ottawa Board of Health's strategic priorities, Provide evidence for current public health funding and accountability agreements, and Inform programming and services for OPH and our community partners. The last three years have exposed health inequities in our community. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of addressing health inequities, as certain population groups have been disproportionately affected by the virus due to underlying health conditions, occupational exposures, and social determinants of health. Throughout the pandemic response, we have shown that we can make an impact by working in partnership with community leaders, engaging with community members, and collaborating with multi-sectoral partners. Based on the evidence presented in this report, there is an ongoing need to continue to work towards improving overall population health while collectively working to narrow the health equity gap for equity-deserving groups. The health priorities that stand out continue to be mental health and substance use health, chronic and infectious diseases. Working collaboratively with partners and community members creates opportunities to establish common goals, increase the consistency of existing efforts, and intensify innovation for greater collective impact on the health of people living in Ottawa. The findings of this report are intended to be used by the many community organizations and partners that work to keep people in Ottawa healthy by preventing disease and promoting well-being. I am grateful to the OPH team for their hard work, collaboration, and dedication to basing their work on the latest data of health needs. We are committed to ongoing work with communities facing greater barriers to health to address gaps in current available data and to understand peoples' experiences beyond what is reflected in the numbers.

It offers insight into various indicators that impact health, including social determinants of health, immunization, infant and child health and development, as well as individual behaviours. The report also provides an overview of the challenges posed by chronic and infectious diseases in the community. The report serves as a valuable resource for Ottawa Public Health (OPH) and community partners to help plan or enhance programs and services, identify strategic priorities, identify gaps, and monitor changes in the health of people living in Ottawa. Highlights of the report include the following: Changes in demographics and population health implications Ottawa is a growing city with changing demographics that will play a critical role in shaping population health planning. The population of Ottawa has increased by approx-imately 17% since the 2016 Census. The largest proportion of residents are 25 to 29 years old. In the coming decades, the greatest growth will occur among those 20 to 49 and those 65 and over. By 2030, it is estimated that older adults, aged 65 and over, will account for 20% of the population. This shift in demographics has significant implications for health resource planning to support an aging population. Ottawa is becoming more diverse with a 7% increase in people who identify as being from a racialized group in 2021 (35%) compared to 2016 (28%). This underscores the importance of continuing ongoing work to support and address the unique health needs of racialized groups within Ottawa. i The EDI is a population-based measure of children's developmental health at school entry across five domains, which in turn are divided into 16 sub-domainsSocial determinants of health and their impact on health equity The health of people is influenced by a range of factors beyond just health care and behaviours. Social determinants of health like income, systemic racism, the lack of adequate housing and stable employment, to name a few, shape the health inequities in society. These factors are often outside the realm of personal choice and are imposed or reinforced societally. In this report, the effects of social determinants of health include: The disproportionate effects of COVID-19: In the first year of the pandemic, the rate of COVID-19 was more than double in the least advantaged neighbourhoods. COVID-19-related hospitalization and death rates were almost 3 times higher in the least advantaged neighbourhoods compared to those with the most advantage throughout the pandemic. The challenges to equitable vaccination against COVID-19: neighbourhoods that are more socioeconomically advantaged generally had higher levels of COVID-19 vaccination compared to those with lower socioeconomic advantage. The effect of income on many measures of health: self-rated health and mental health is approximately 20% lower in neighbourhoods with the lowest socioeconomic advantage compared to those with the most advantage. The impact of neighbourhood socioeconomic status on measures of school readiness in children: the percentage of children vulnerable in at least one Early Development Instrument (EDI) i domain ranged from 4% to 52% across Ottawa neighbourhoods, with the prevalence of vulnera-bility generally increasing in neighbourhoods with lower socioeconomic status. For example, approx-imately half of children in the neighbourhoods of Carlington, Sandy Hill and Greenboro East are vulnerable in at least one EDI domain.2State of Ottawa's Health Report - 2023 The lack of access to regular medical providers: 14% of the people living in Ottawa, or approximately 122,000 people, do not have access to a regular health care provider. This proportion is higher among people who have immigrated in the past 10 years with 38% not having access to a regular health care provider. The inequitable impact of chronic disease: while leading causes of hospitalizations are similar across neighbourhoods regardless of socioeconomic advantage, hospitalization rates are between 15 to 30% higher in the neighbourhoods with lowest socioeconomic advantage compared to those with the highest advantage. Ottawa Public Health has continued to build relation-ships with key partners and community members, making inroads to better support communities' COVID-19 response and prevention. OPH is also advocating for better collection of social determinants of health data to improve system transparency, to reduce inequities, and better monitor population health outcomes. Mental health and substance use health The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the pre-existing mental health and substance use health challenges experienced by many people in Ottawa: An estimated 60% of people living in Ottawa rated their mental health as very good or excellent in 2019/2020, an approximate 8 to 10% decrease from previous years. 12%, or approximately 100,600 people, rated their mental health as fair to poor. Self-rated mental health tends to be lowest among females, people aged 20 to 44, those in the two lowest income quintiles, those who rent their home and those living alone. The COVID-19 pandemic created additional strains on mental health and substance use health. In October of 2020, only 28% of people who responded to a population survey rated their men-tal health as very good or excellent. This improved to 43% by November of 2021 but was still lower than the estimates prior to the pandemic. Also in November of 2021, about a quarter (24%) also reported that in the past two weeks they wanted to reach out for mental health support but did not know where to turn. Self-harm is among the leading causes of injury-related hospitalizations among those aged 15 to 44. This is similar to what has been seen in previous reports. Emergency department visits for opioid-related overdoses among residents of Ottawa more than doubled from 443 in 2019 to 982 in 2021 high-lighting the impact of COVID-19 on opioid use. Similarly, deaths more than doubled from 65 in 2019 to 148 in 2021, exacerbating an increase in opioid-related harms that began in 2017. Chronic disease, injury and health-related behaviours The health of Ottawa residents is influenced by chronic conditions/diseases and associated risk factors, which are shaped by social determinants of health, as well as individual circumstances and behaviours: Residents of Ottawa aged 18 and older identify arthritis (16%), high blood pressure (16%), anxiety (10%) and mood disorders (10%) as their most common chronic conditions. By age 65 and older, arthritis (43%), high blood pressure (41%), heart disease (20%) and diabetes (16%) are most common. Cardiovascular disease, endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, genitourinary disease and digestive diseases are the most common causes of hospitalizations for chronic diseases. Injuries are the leading cause of emergency department (ED) visits and the fifth most common cause of hospitalizations. Smoking rates continue to decline. An estimated 9% of residents of Ottawa aged 19 and older reported they are current smokers, down from 15% in 2017/2018. An estimated 3% of students in State of Ottawa's Health Report - 20233grades 7 through 12 reported smoking a cigarette in the past year. Using the new alcohol use risk guidelines developed by the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, 69% of the people in Ottawa aged 19 and older are at no or low risk of alcohol related harms, 15% are at moderate risk and 16% are at high risk. Among those in grades 7 to 12, 32% had consumed alcohol in the past year. In the most recent estimates from 2017/2018, 67% of adults over the age of 18 identified that they met the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines. In 2019, 21% of children aged 5 to 11had an active day on one or two days in the past week; 19% were active 3 or 4 days; and 21% were active at least 5 days in the past week. In 2021, 29% of students in grades 7 to 12 reported having between one and three active days in the past week, 37% were active 5 or 6 days, and 18% were active every day in the past week. In Ottawa, 58% of people aged 18 and older report a height and weight that would classify them as being overweight or obese. This is relatively unchanged over the past 5 years but the percent of the population who is overweight and obese has increased over the past 15 years. This percentage is higher among men and those aged 45 and older. In 2020, the proportion of people in Ottawa who were screened for breast and cervical cancer has decreased and there is an increasing proportion of those overdue for colorectal cancer screening. Infectious diseases Ottawa Public Health reports on diseases of public health significance to help identify disease trends, and track and manage disease outbreaks. Infectious disease, particularly new and re-emerging disease, is an important health risk for the people living in Ottawa and can impact health systems and society. Early detection and mitigation is a critical part of the public health response to infectious diseases. COVID-19 has been the most significant infectious disease challenge in recent history, with respect to both the direct effects of the disease including hospitalizations and deaths, and indirect impacts on mental health, well-being and society at large. Through the end of 2022, 88,012 people were confirmed positive for COVID-19 infection; 3,464 people were hospitalized, and 1,001 died, due to their infection. COVID-19 also challenged existing population health and health services like childhood immunization, access to primary care services, routine vaccinations and health related screenings. A global outbreak of mpox (pronounced \"em-pox\" and formerly known as \"monkeypox\") occurred in 2022 which included countries that have not historically reported mpox cases. The first person with mpox was reported in Ottawa in May 2022 and a total of 42 people in Ottawa were diagnosed between May and September 2022. The incidence of mpox in Ottawa was lower than the average of Ontario-less-Ottawa in 2022, which was driven by a high number of cases in Toronto. The rate of tuberculosis in Ottawa has increased slightly over the last six years from 4.6 to 5.5 per 100,000 people and is higher than the average for Ontario-less-Ottawa (4.6 per 100,000). Influenza activity was very low during the pandemic, then increased during fall 2022 for a shorter but more intense season that disproportionately impacted children and youth compared to pre-pandemic years. As of mid-March 2023, 870 people in Ottawa tested positive for influenza, slightly above the pre-pandemic average of 833, and 40% were under age 20 years. The incidence of sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections decreased during the pandemic, which could be attributed to factors such as reduced testing, as well as fewer sexual contacts due to public health measures. Recently, rates have begun to rebound to pre-pandemic levels. OPH is actively preparing for the possible re-emergence of measles due to outbreaks occurring worldwide and a pandemic-related decrease in population vaccine coverage in young people in Ottawa. OPH is drawing on expertise gained from its experiences with COVID-19 as well as past responses to inform its preparations for measles prevention and control.4State of Ottawa's Health Report - 2023INTRODUCTION A detailed understanding of the population of Ottawa creates the foundation upon which the work of Ottawa Public Health (OPH) is built. Understanding not only the health of the people living in Ottawa, but also individual behaviours, living conditions, and life experiences is essential for improving the health of the people who live here. The City of Ottawa combines the diversity that comes from a population of over a million people, with a large area that varies from rural farmland to a downtown urban core. This report both celebrates that diversity, and highlights where there are differences in health among different populations in Ottawa. This report is a resource for OPH and health partners to help plan or enhance programs and services, identify strategic priorities, identify gaps, and monitor changes in the health of people living in Ottawa. This report also fulfills the requirement for public health units to assess and report on population health, as stipulated in the Ontario Public Health Standards. ii The report is intended to be interpreted at the City of Ottawa level. While it provides information about specific groups, such as those living in low income or who identify as racialized, many data sources do not include information on social determinants of health or not all indicators can be estimated for all groups of interest. Similarly, many estimates cannot be reported for neighbourhoods or other small geographical areas because they become unreliable due to survey coverage or small sample size. OPH works with our partners at the Ottawa Neighbourhood Study to provide robust health measures estimates by neigh-bourhood. This is important to note because health inequities in Ottawa exist and are closely tied to social determinants of health such as economic advantage and racialization. 1The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the importance of these factors as areas in Ottawa with low economic advantage or greater populations of people who are racialized bore a higher health burden of disease from COVID-19. 2OPH has been working to collect social deter- ii The Ontario Public Health Standards identify the minimum expectations for public health programs and services to be delivered by Ontario's 34 boards of health and are available at https://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/oph_standards/ iii Ottawa public health Morbidity and mortality data can be found at https://www.ottawapublichealth.ca/en/reports-research-and-statistics/morbidity- mortality-quality-of-life.aspx#Leading-Causes-of-Emergency-Department-Visits-Hospitalizations-and-Death-Overall-and-by-Sexminants of health data for people who tested positive for COVID-19 or were immunized with a COVID-19 vaccine and building this framework into our data systems. OPH has also been advocating for the inclusion of social determinants of health data in other data systems used by health units across Ontario. OPH also works with community members and partners to collaboratively advance efforts to address the population health concerns of equity-deserving groups. COVID-19 has directly affected indicators and measures of health status. For example, in Canada, emergency department visits dropped to about half the usual number in the spring of 2020, rebounding by summer but still lower than pre-pandemic levels. 3This is likely due to public health directives at the time or people's willingness to seek care at an emergency department. Similarly, indicators such as self-rated mental health have been influenced by the pandemic, as will be shown in this report. This may include effects like increased worry, a disruption in social connectedness and social networks, as well as decreased access to mental health care or support. Survey data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) is from the 2019/2020 calendar years so includes some data pre-dating COVID-19 and some in the early parts of the pandemic. While some effects of COVID-19 on indicators like mental health may be temporary, it is important to acknowledge the effects of the pandemic beyond disease incidence and to keep this effect in mind when interpreting the findings in this report. The health conditions and indicators mentioned in this report include those that provide insight into the health of people living in Ottawa and have recent and robust data sources. Missing from this report are the most recent estimates of leading causes of death or other details of mortality for the population in Ottawa. At the time this report was prepared, vital statistics data was only available to 2015 and did not present a contemporary view of mortality in Ottawa, nor did it provide an update beyond what is available on the OPH website. iiiMore recent mortality data will be analysed and published at a future date.State of Ottawa's Health Report - 20235DATA NOTES Data were analyzed using Stata v17 or PowerBI (ver Feb 2023). Footnotes are shown with Arabic numerals (1, 20, 45) and References are shown with Roman numerals ( i, xx, xlv ). In this document, percentages (proportions) are rounded to the nearest whole number e.g. 11.7% is rounded to 12%. Rates are expressed with 1 decimal point e.g. 12.1 per 100,000. The symbol * denotes that the estimate should be inter-preted with caution due to high variability in responses. Some results are suppressed due to unreliability. Where comparisons by subgroup are made, only statisti-cally significant differences (differences that are unlikely due to chance) are shown unless an explicit comparison (e.g Ottawa to the rest of Ontario) is intended. Point estimates are provided with 95% confidence inter-vals. The 95% confidence interval includes the true value 95 times out of 100. E.g. If the point estimate for the percentage of youth using alcohol is 58% (95%CI: 44%, 70%), then the range from 44% to 70% will contain the true population value 95% of the time. The narrower the confidence interval is, the more precise the estimate. A single number for the confidence interval in graphs and tables is the difference between the upper or lower limit of the confidence interval and the point estimate. For example a confidence interval of 1.2% means the lower limit is 1.2% below the point estimate and the upper limit is 1.2% above the point estimate. If two numbers appear, these represent the lower and upper limits of the confidence interval. Estimates for \"Ontario-less-Ottawa\" do not include Ottawa counts/responses in the numerator or denominator. Any differences between Ottawa and Ontario-less-Ottawa should be interpreted as Ottawa being different from the average of individuals across Ontario excluding those individuals from the Ottawa area.Estimates may vary from other sources. Analysis in this report includes a category for \"Don't know or refused\" if the estimate for this group is 5% or higher. Other sources may not report on this group regardless of its estimated size. Income data from the Canadian Community Health Survey is described by income quintiles. This is based on the derived variable in a distribution of people in each health region in deciles (ten categories including approximately the same percentage of people for each province) based on the adjusted ratio of their total household income to the low income cut-off corresponding to their household and community size. It provides, for each respondent, a relative measure of their household income to the household incomes of all other respondents in the same health region. In this report, quintile 1 is the highest income and quintile 5, the lowest. The neighbourhood socioeconomic status (SES) index is based on neighbourhood-level measures from the 2016 Census including the prevalence of lone-parent families, unemployment rate, education levels, and income. 4 Based on this SES index, the neighbourhoods have been divided into five groups or \"quintiles.\" Quintile 5 indicates that a neighbourhood is among those with the lowest socioeconomic advantage and Quintile 1 represents the most socioeconomically advantaged neighbourhoods. The language in this report is rooted in the original data source. Some language may not be representative of OPH's preferred language and was used for consistency with its original data source. The terminology \"male\" and \"female,\" for example, are associated with sex assigned at birth whereas gender identity is related to how individuals define and experience their gender, how they move through the world, and how others perceive them as gendered people. Ottawa Public Health recognizes that individuals can identify their gender identity in a multitude of ways, however, this report at times uses terminology that does not align with this as many data sources continue to use sex assigned at birth and biological traits. The terms \"racialized population\" or \"racialized groups\" in 2021 Census products are 6State of Ottawa's Health Report - 2023used in this report but are still defined by the concept of \"visible minority\" from the Employment Equity Act. This definition uses specific groups and does not include Indigenous peoples as a \"visible minority.\" 5Statistics Canada is currently reviewing this concept.iv Cancer incidence estimates in this report are based on data and information provided by Ontario Health.

In the coming decades, the greatest growth will occur among those 20 to 49 and those 65 and over, and by 2030, it is estimated that older adults, aged 65 and over, will account for 20% of the population. The increasing proportion of older adults means individuals in Ottawa will have higher health service needs into the future. It also increases the dependency ratio, the proportion of the non-working population that needs to be supported by the working age population. The City of Ottawa growth projections for the Official Plan estimate that the dependency ratio will increase from 46.2 in 2018 to 58.6 in 2046. 9Slightly more than half (51%) of Ottawa residents are women+; and the remaining 49% are men+. 10Statistics Canada categorizes women+ as women and girls, as well as some persons who are non-binary persons and men+ as men and boys, as well as some persons who are non-binary. LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH Life expectancy at birth for someone living in Ottawa who was born during 2015 to 2017 is estimated to be 83.7 years overall, 81.9 years for men and 85.3 years for women. These estimates have not changed substantively since 2011. 11It is not yet known to what extent Ottawa life expectancy estimates may become influenced by the excess mortality seen in Canada during the pandemic. 12 Figure 1.

The fertility rate (number of live births per 1,000 females aged 15 to 49 years) has declined over the past 10 years from 42.9 births per 1,000 females in 2013 to 38.5 births per 1,000 females in 2021, and preliminary 2022 birth data show another decline to 36.5 births per 1,000 females (Figure 2).Fertility rates were highest among women aged 30 to 34 years, followed by women aged 35 to 39 years and women aged 25 to 29 years. The number and rate of live births among teenagers dropped 60% from 158 births in 2013 to 64 births in 2020. This was similar in 2021 with 57 live births and 2022 with 60 live births (2022 data is preliminary). In 2021, 97% of births were singletons and 3% were multiples (Figure 3). Figure 2.

Nearly one quarter (23%) of people's mother tongue is a language other than English or French. The top three mother tongue languages for people whose mother tongue is a language other than English or French are Arabic (16%), Chinese (12%), and Spanish (5%). ORIGIN AND IDENTITY Indigenous According to the 2021 Census, 3% of the population in Ottawa identified as Indigenous, including First Nations (North American Indian), Inuk (Inuit) and M\u00e9tis. 14This estimate is similar to what was observed in 2016, although likely an underestimate of the actual Indigenous population living in Ottawa. Of note, OPH has implemented a Reconcili-ACTION plan and continues to actively work with Indigenous partners and community members to support actions that foster and promote Indigenous rights and reconciliation. This includes a commitment to data governance principles that support the safe and respectful collection, use, and disclosure of data.Figure 3.

Black, Middle Eastern, and South Asian were the most frequently reported racialized groups. Immigration Status and Country of Origin About a quarter (26%) of the 2021 population living in Ottawa were born outside of Canada15and is relatively unchanged from the 2016 Census (24%).16Among Canadian immigrants living in Ottawa, half immigrated within the last 20 years, with 5% immigrating within the last five years. At time of immigration, the majority of people were between 25 and 44 years old. Most recent newcomers came from Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe (Table 1 / Figure 4).Table 1.

This includes social deter-minants of health like income, education, employment, and housing, as well as behaviours that have an impact on health like physical activity, smoking and alcohol use. Some of these factors are often outside the realm of personal choice and are imposed or reinforced societally. Often behaviours may be influenced or constrained by these social determinants of health. INDIVIDUAL AND HOUSEHOLD INCOME The median after-tax individual income for people living in Ottawa over 15 years of age was $44,000 in 2020,18 up 18% from $37,136 in 2015. This increase exceeded cumulative inflation over the same time period (10%). 19 The median after-tax household income was $88,000 in 2020, up only 2% from $85,981 in 2015. This increase was less than the rate of inflation. The estimated cost of living for a family of two adults and two children was $50,355 in Ottawa in 2021, a 9% increase over five years from 2017 ($46,123). This estimate, called the Market Basket Measure (MBM), considers the cost of clothing, food, footwear, transpor-tation, shelter, and other expenses. 20 Individuals living in low income Close to 89,000 individuals, or 9% of people in Ottawa, lived in low income in 2020, adjusting for household size using the after-tax low income measure (LIM-AT v). This is a decrease from 13% in 2015.21Because this low income estimate is determined after tax, to better represent the income available to a household, part of the decrease in the prevalence of low income may be a result of pandemic relief benefits and changes in child-benefit payments in 2021. 22Those aged 18- to v The Low-income measure, after tax, refers to a fixed percentage (50%) of median-adjusted after-tax income of private households. The household after-tax income is adjusted by an equivalence scale to take economies of scale into account. This adjustment for different household sizes reflects the fact that a household's needs increase, but at a decreasing rate, as the number of members increases.64-year-olds were less likely to live in low income in 2020 (8%) than those aged 17 and under (11%) or individuals 65 years and older (9%). EDUCATION People in Ottawa are well-educated with three quarters (77%) of adults (aged 25 to 64 years) holding a postsec-ondary education certificate, diploma or degree, 18% hold a high school diploma or equivalent, and only 5% not having completed high school. This is a higher proportion that hold a postsecondary education (77% vs 75%) compared to 2016. 23, 24 EMPLOYMENT Unemployment has improved since the earliest years of the pandemic. In 2022, monthly unemployment ranged from 3% to 6%, which is lower compared to the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020 monthly range: 4% to 10%; 2021 monthly range: 5% to 13%). 25 HOUSING Housing is an absolute necessity for living a healthy life. Living in unsafe, unaffordable, or insecure housing increases the risk of many health issues. 26A home is more than simply shelter; it can also be a source of secu-rity, dignity and identity. Canada's residential housing accounts for over one-fifth of our national wealth. 27 While the share of renters is growing at over twice the pace as owners, the difference in net worth growth between homeowners and renters continues to increase. The net worth of homeowners more than doubled from $323,700 in 1999 to $685,400 in 2019, while the net worth of renters of all ages rose from $14,600 to $24,000 in the same time period. 14State of Ottawa's Health Report - 2023Affordable Housing In 2021, 42% of renter households paid 30% or more of their household income on shelter costs compared to 14% of owner households. 28 In October of 2022, Ottawa had a vacancy rate of 2% in apartment structures of three units or more. Average rent of a 2-bedroom unit was $1,625 per month, a 5% increase from the previous year. 29Rent increases were highest among turnover rentals, with 2-bedroom units having a 17% increase as of October 2022 compared to 2021. COMMUNITY BELONGING A sense of community belonging and social connected- ness is associated with both physical and mental health. People with a strong sense of community belonging tend to rate their self-perceived general and mental health higher than the people who do not. 30In Ottawa, 69% of people had a somewhat to very strong sense of community belonging in 2019 to 2020 which is similar to past years. This sense of belonging tends to be highest in those over 19 years of age and somewhat lower in renters versus owners (63% versus 72%) and single people versus families with children (59% versus 74%). 31 In terms of school connectedness and belonging, in 2021, three quarters (74%) of grade 7 to 12 students reported they liked school, 71% reported they felt part of their school, and 88% reported feeling safe at their school (all similar to the rest of Ontario and to 2019) (Figure 5). However, only two-thirds (65%) of Ottawa students reported feeling close to people at their school in 2021, which was lower than in the rest of Ontario and in 2019 (74% and 80%, respectively). Not all students reported feeling close to people at their school. A higher percentage of students said they did not feel close to people in their school among those in grades 9 to 12 vi For more information on the calculation of the nutritious food basket, see https://www.ottawapublichealth.ca/en/public-health-topics/food-insecurity. aspx#2022-Nutritious-Food-Basketcompared to grades 7 and 8 (37% vs. 25%), or were of socioeconomic disadvantage compared to socio-economic advantage (54% vs. 27%) or identified with another gender identity (78%) compared to men/boys (28%) and women/girls (36%). 32, 33 FOOD SECURITY Food insecurity is the insufficient or unreliable access to food due to financial constraints and ranges from marginal to severe food insecurity. 34Food insecurity continues to persist in Ottawa. Three-year estimates from the 2018, 2019, and 2020 Canadian Income Survey indicate that 13% of Ottawa households face food insecurity, with approximately 4% being marginally food insecure, 6% being moderately food insecure and 3% being severely food insecure. 35In Ottawa, the monthly cost of a nutritious food basketvi for a family of four in 2022 is $1,088.36 In 2019, 10%* of Ottawa students in grade 7 to 12 reported always or often going to bed or to school hungry because there was not enough food at home. This estimate was significantly higher than the rest of Ontario (6%). Most recent estimates for Ottawa are not reportable; however, in Ontario 3%* of grade 7 to 12 students reported always or often going to bed or school hungry in 2021. 37, 38 Approximately one fifth (22%) of students reported eating fruits and vegetables four or more times per day in 2021, while 52% reported eating them two to three times and 17% reported eating them less than twice daily. This was similar to the rest of Ontario and to 2019. Students of socioeconomic disadvantage were significantly less likely to report consuming fruits and vegetables four or more times daily than were those of socioeconomic advantage (13%* vs. 25%).State of Ottawa's Health Report - 202315020406080100Percentage (%) Like school Feel part of schoolFeel safe at schoolFeel close to people at schoolOttawa 2019 Percentage of students in grades 7 to 12 who reported school connectedness in the past year in Ottawa, 2019 and 2021, and Ontario-less-Ottawa, 2021.

ACCESS TO A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER Access to a high-quality health care system is a social determinant of health and a basic human right.39In Ottawa, 86% of residents aged 12 and older stated they had a regular health care provider they could visit or talk to when they needed care or advice about their health. 40 This was lower than the rest of Ontario where 90% said they had access to a regular health care provider. This means that in Ottawa about 14% of the population (approximately 122,000) did not have access to a regular health care provider. Access to a regular health provider was highest among older age groups, those in highest income quintiles, those living rurally and home-owners (Figure 6). It was lowest among people who had immigrated within the past 10 years (62%). In Ottawa, 65% of residents with a regular health care provider thought they could get immediate care for a minor problem within three days. However, an estimated 189,000 thought they would wait between 4 days to two weeks and a further 59,800 thought they'd wait two weeks or more. Approximately 2 out of 3 (64%) rated the coordination between levels of care as very good to excellent where such care was required. Thirteen percent of those with a regular health care provider and where coordinated care was required (approximately 39,800) thought coordination was fair to poor.16State of 50 60 70 80 90 100 Percentage (%)0.7 8.0 8.0 8.27.1 7.03.9 2.0 5.8 6.4Ottawa Ontario less Ottawa 86% 99%Urban Rural 92%71% Owner Renter86%62% Not a newcomer Newcomer within past 10 years 96% Newcomer over 10 years ago12-19 year olds 20-44 year olds 45-64 year olds 65+ year olds Quintile 1 - Highest income Quintile 2 - Second highest income Quintile 3 - Medium income Quintile 4 - Second lowest income Quintile 5 - Lowest income Con/f_idence IntervalsPercentage% % %3.5 3.9 3.916.3 3.1 8.72.5 CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION Immunization through vaccination is a key public health and primary care initiative to prevent illness, disability, and death from vaccine preventable diseases. As part of the National Immunization Strategy, vaccination coverage goals for vaccine preventable diseases have been set according to international standards and best practices to minimize the harms associated with these diseases. 41High immunization coverage is essential for the effective prevention and control of vaccine prevent-able diseases. vii Varicella is an ISPA required vaccine for children born in 2010 or later.For children and youth there are nine diseases (diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis, meningococcal disease, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vii) for which vaccination coverage is required to attend school in Ontario under the Immunization of School Pupils Act (ISPA). ISPA-required immunizations are primarily given by community health care providers except for ones given by the public health unit as part of the school-based immunization program (see School-based Immunization section on page 18). Under ISPA, immunizations administered by community providers are to be reported to Ottawa Public Health by families. OPH sends personalized letters to parents and caregivers, on an annual basis, to remind them to report their children's immunizations to OPH.Figure 6. Percent of population aged 12 and older who stated they had access to a regular health care provider by subgroup, 2019-2020. Source: Canadian Community Health Survey 2019-2020, Statistics Canada, Share File, Ontario Ministry of HealthState of Ottawa's Health Report - 202317Routine Childhood Immunizations Pre-pandemic Routine Childhood Immunization Coverage Immunization coverage rates in the 2018-19 school year for all immunizations required under ISPA among 7-year-olds and 17-year-olds living in Ottawa were 80% and 71%, respectively. 42Rates among 7-year-olds surpassed national coverage of 95% for rubella and meningo-coccal C conjugate (MenCC) and were below the goals for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis, measles, mumps, Haemophilius influenza type B (Hib), viiipneumococcal disease,ixand varicella (Figure 7). Among 17-year-olds living in Ottawa, pre-pandemic coverage rates were below national goals of 90% for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. These coverage estimates are limited to immunizations reported to public health. COVID-19 Pandemic Impacts on Immunization Coverage Decreases in vaccine coverage rates can increase the risk of vaccine preventable diseases like measles, particularly as travel to countries experiencing outbreaks increases. Coverage for measles vaccination, for both first and second doses, has steadily declined globally since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, putting many children at risk of this serious and highly contagious disease. Both the World Health Organization and the Pan-American Health Organization have issued statements regarding the increased risk of measles globally. 43, 44 In Ottawa, the COVID-19 pandemic has substantially disrupted access to routine childhood and school-based immunizations. The closure of primary care offices and schools, the shift to virtual care, stay-at-home orders, early retirement of health care providers, and the diver-sion of public health resources to COVID-19 activities, like case management and mass immunization, have all impacted vaccination rates. viii Not an ISPA-designated disease. ix Not an ISPA-designated disease.The pandemic has also impacted the reporting of immunizations to OPH. OPH's typical ISPA surveillance activities to remind families to report childhood immuni-zations were paused from March 2020 until the current school year (2022-23). As a result, the primary source for immunization information for children and youth in Ontario is incomplete and underestimates current coverage rates. ISPA surveillance activities are currently underway for students born in 2015 (~7-years-old) and 2005 (~17-years-old) and as a result both immunization and reporting rates are improving. Coverage rates for these birth cohorts will be explored once ISPA surveil-lance is complete at the end of the current school year. Assessing the Gap in Routine Childhood Immunizations due to the Pandemic Given the current limitations of the immunization records system for estimating vaccination coverage, we conducted an analysis of vaccine distribution data to estimate the impact of the pandemic on routine child-hood immunization rates. OPH is the sole distributor of routine childhood vaccines to immunizers in the health unit's catchment area. The trends in vaccine distribution over time were used to make inferences about vaccination coverage. Overall, we found that the volume of routine childhood vaccine doses distributed by OPH was at an all-time low in March 2020. Although distribution volumes are gradually recovering, they have not yet reached pre-pandemic levels. Distribution volumes varied by vaccine product. Based on the relative differences in distributed vaccines over time (Figure 8) and the estimated population of children and youth due for specific vaccines (based on a routine schedule), the estimated total number of doses of routine immunizations missed between 2020 and 2022 among children and youth in Ottawa was over 40,000. Of these, approximately 15,000 were missed doses of vaccines which protect against measles. 18State of Ottawa's Health Report - 2023020406080100Percentage in Ottawa 17-year-olds in National Goal for 7-year-olds 17-year-olds in OntarioNational Goal for 7- and 17-year-olds National Goal for 17-year-olds Childhood vaccines typically administered up to age 1, such as DTaP-IPV-Hib,xsaw little to no change in the total annual number of doses distributed during 2020-22 compared to pre-pandemic, while other vaccines had lower distribution (Figure 8). Distribution volumes of MMR (given at 1 year), MMR-Var (4 to 6 years), Tdap-IPV (4 to 6 years), and Tdap (14 to16 years) dropped by 27% to 47% in 2020 compared to pre-pandemic, with only Tdap-IPV returning to pre-pandemic volumes in 2022. MMR-Var, 23%, 9%, and 20%, respectively in 2022) (Table 2). As a result, not only is there a backlog of children and youth needing these immunizations due to initial pandemic closures, but the number who are not covered for measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, continues to grow. To clear the backlog, above average rates of vaccine distribution x For a description of which diseases are covered by which vaccine product, refer to Table 2and administration are needed. OPH has informed primary care providers, caregivers and parents of the importance of childhood vaccines and is attempting to reduce barriers. Enhanced access to vaccination through neighbourhood hubs, community clinics and organized catch-up school-based clinics for some vaccinations have been prioritized to address this issue. School-based Immunizations (Hepatitis B, HPV and Meningococcal Vaccines) There are three vaccines which are part of Ontario's publicly funded school-based immunization program, typically delivered by public health to grade 7 students (~12-year-olds): hepatitis B, human papilloma virus (HPV), and quadrivalent C (MCV4). Only MCV4 is required under ISPA. Figure 7. Immunization coverage rates for school year 2018-19 among 7- and 17-year-olds in Ottawa, and national coverage goals, by disease.

OPH returned to providing these vaccines at school clinics in the 2021-22 school year. However, vaccination uptake continued to be impacted by the isolation requirements for COVID-19 cases and contacts, which kept students out of school when vaccines were being offered. The expansion of COVID-19 immunization eligibility to 12 to 17 year-olds (May 2021), also limited the administration of other vaccines due to the recommendation not to co-administer vaccines within two weeks of each other. 46 As a result, coverage rates among 12-year-olds remained lower in 2021-22 compared to pre-pandemic (Figure 9). 47 To help students catch up on missed school-based vaccinations throughout the pandemic the student eligibility for HPV and hepatitis B vaccines was expanded provincially up to age 18. OPH began offering these vaccines to both grade 7 and 8 students at school-based clinics, as well as running targeted high school catch-up clinics for grade 9 to 12 students who may have missed them. These catch-up efforts are improving coverage in impacted cohorts, but rates remain lower than pre-pandemic. 48 EARLY CHILD DEVELOPMENT From birth to six years there are critical periods during which particular physical, emotional, social, language, and communication skills are developed. The Early Development Instrument (EDI) is a population-based measure of children's developmental health at school entry across five domains, which in turn are divided into 16 sub-domains. Five EDI cycles have been completed in Ottawa, starting in 2005/06. For more information on previous cycles of the EDI in Ottawa, please refer to the Our Kids, Their Story...Snapshot of Developmental Health at School Entry in Ottawa 2005-2015 report published by the Parent Resource Centre (PRC). More recent data is based on correspondence with the PRC and analysis by Ottawa Public Health. In the most recent cycle (Cycle 5 - 2017/18), 28% of senior kindergarten (SK) children in Ottawa were found to be vulnerable in at least one of the five EDI domains. 49This percentage has increased significantly since the previous EDI cycle (26%) but is lower than the provincial average (30%). In all five EDI domains, the percentage of vulnerable SK children in Ottawa was lower than the Ontario average. When looking at specific domains, the percentage of vul-nerable SK children in the Physical Health and Well-Being and the Language and Cognitive Development domains has increased since the previous cycle in Ottawa. However, there were improvements with a lower percentage of vulnerable SK children in the Communication Skills and General Knowledge domain (Table 3). The percentage of children vulnerable in at least one EDI domain ranged from 4% to 52% across Ottawa neigh-bourhoods. 50The percentage of children vulnerable in at least one EDI domain generally increases with decreas-ing neighbourhood socioeconomic status. 51Neighbour- hoods with a high proportion of children vulnerable in at least one EDI domain include: Carlington (52%), Sandy Hill (51%), Greenboro East (49.5%), Hunt Club East (46%), Bells Corners (46%), Carleton Heights - Rideauview (44%). 2019-20 (with catch up)2010-21 (with catch B (12 yo) Hepatitus B (17 yo)HPV (12 yo)HPV (17 yo) MCV4 (12 yo) MCV4 (17 yo) Figure 9.

PRC.22State of Ottawa's Health Report - 2023PHYSICAL ACTIVITY , SEDENTARY BEHAVIOUR AND SLEEP Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Regular physical activity is an important component of health. In addition to decreasing stress, and building or maintaining strength, balance, flexibility and coordina-tion for healthy aging, physical activity helps prevent many chronic diseases including cancer, obesity, hyper-tension, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. In 2017-2018, 67%53of Ottawa adults stated that they met the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines for adults aged 18 to 64 years of having at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, in bouts of 10 minutes or more. xiThis was higher than the rest of Ontario (55%). Activity levels were higher among males, those under the age of 65, those with an English mother-tongue and those with post-secondary education (Figure 10). The Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines for Children and Youth recommend that children and youth accumu-late at least 60 minutes per day of moderate to vigorous physical activity, defined as activity that causes a person to sweat at least a little or to breathe harder. An \"active day\" is referred to as a day during which this goal is met. Children who use physically active forms of transportation such as walking or biking, may accumulate more active days per week compared to those who use motorized transport (inactive transportation). In addition to health benefits, active transportation is beneficial to the environment and to increasing social ties around the community. 54, 55 xi This is one criteria of the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines, but does not include light physical activity and muscle strengthening activities. https://csepguidelines.ca/guidelines/adults-18-64/In 2019, 13% of children in Ottawa aged 5 to 11 years used active forms of transportation to travel to school, 12% used a mix of active and inactive transportation and 75% used inactive forms of transportation to get to school. Among youth aged 12 to 17 years, 11%* used active transportation to get to school, 15% used a mix of active and inactive transportation and 74% used inactive forms of transportation. 56 Twenty-three percent of children in Ottawa aged 5 to 11 years were reported by their parent/caregiver as not having an active day on any day in a previous week; 21% had an active day on one or two days in the past week; 19% were active 3 or 4 days; and 21% were active least 5 days in the past week. 57 Of Ottawa students in grades 7 to 12 in 2021, 7% reported not having any active day in the previous week; 29% reported having between one and three active days in the past week, 37% were active 5 or 6 days, and 18% were active every day in the past week. These estimates were not different from the rest of Ontario nor from 2019. Male students (22%) were significantly more likely to meet the movement guidelines than were females (15%). 58, 59 Screen Time In 2021, approximately three quarters (73%) of Ottawa students (grades 7 to 12) reported spending more than two hours per day engaging in recreational screen time (e.g., watching tv, playing video games, texting, surfing the Internet, etc.). This was similar to students from the rest of Ontario (79%) and in 2019 (77%). Students in grade 9 to 12 compared to those in grade 7 and 8 (74% vs. 63%), as well as those with socioeconomic disadvantage compared to those with socioeconomic advantage (84% vs. 72%) were significantly more likely to engage in two or more hours of daily recreational screen time. 60, 61State of Ottawa's 18.2* 8.2 4.2 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Percentage (%)Ottawa Ontario less Ottawa English French Other73% 68% 4.5Female Male 65+ year olds Less than high school graduation High school graduation Post-secondary educationCon/f_idence Intervals PercentageInterpret with caution % % %* Sleep Sleep is an integral part of the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines, which recommend that preschoolers aged 3 to 4 years get between 10 and 13 hours of sleep includingnaps, children aged 5 to13 years get between 9 and 11 hoursof uninterrupted sleep per night, while youth aged 14 to 17 years should get 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night.

Available from: https://cancercareontario.ca/ontariocancerprofiles .State of Ottawa's Health Report - 202325OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY Obesity is a complex health issue with a multitude of causes and contributors that are multifaceted. At a population level, the prevalence of obesity is measured using Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a common tool used to classify individuals according to the health risks associated to a weight status to measure the risk of health outcomes in populations. 65BMI is calculated by dividing body weight by the square root of the person's height. In Ottawa, 58% of residents aged 18 and older report a height and weight that would classify them as being overweight or obese. This percentage is higher among men and those aged 45 and older (Figure 13). The percent of the population who is classified as overweight or obese has been increasing over the past 15 years, but there has been little change in the past 5 years (Figure 14). In 2019/2020, over half (54%) of children in Ottawa (ages 5 to 11 years) were reported by their parent/caregiver to have a height and weight that would classify them as not being overweight or obese and at least one-fifth (22%) as being overweight or obese in 2019. A further 24% parents/caregivers of children ages 5 to 11 did not provide enough information to determine their child's BMI. 66 In 2021, three in five (59%) grade 7 to 12 students reported a healthy weight (BMI = 18.5-24.9), while 14%* were 30.0). Just 3%* of students reported a BMI that put them at risk of being underweight (BMI <18.5). These estimates were similar to the rest of Ontario and to 2019. Students of socioeconomic disadvantage were significantly less likely to report being a healthy weight than those of socioeconomic advantage (51% vs. 64%). 67, 68 Sugar Sweetened Beverages Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) such as soft drinks, fruit drinks, sports and energy drinks, and sweetened milks is one of the dietary factors contributing to excess weight, obesity and the onset of chronic disease in both children and adults. 69In 2021, 70% of Ottawa students in grades 7 to 12 reported drinking at least one SSB in the past 7 days, which was not different from the rest of Ontario but significantly lower than in 2019 (78%). In addition, 11% of students reported drinking at least one SSB daily, which again was not different to the rest of Ontario or from 2019. 70, 71 SUBSTANCE USE HEALTH Substance use health refers to health associated with the consumption of alcohol, cannabis, opioids or other substances. Improving substance use health reduces the harms associated with substance use which can prevent injury, illness or death. Like physical and mental health, substance use health can fluctuate on a day-to-day basis, as circumstances change. Individuals deal with stressors and challenges differently. Some people may find themselves consuming more substances or experi-encing challenges with their substance use during times of increased stress. The context of substance use health has also changed, as evidenced by the worsening opioid crisis and the increased toxicity of the unregulated drug supply due to fentanyl. Opioids Although the harms from substances such as opioids are not new; their impact has reached crisis proportions in many countries, including Canada. This section uses emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths as a proxy for opioid-related overdoses. However, it is important to note that not all people who experience an overdose seek care or have a fatal outcome; meaning that this data underestimates the true health burden of opioids and the overdose crisis. The overdose crisis is present in Ottawa; while hospital- ization rates for residents of Ottawa have remained relatively unchanged between 2016 and 2021, rates of emergency department visits more than tripled from 25 per 100,000 population (243 visits) in 2016 to 92 per 100,000 population (982 visits) in 2021. Death rates increased similarly from 4 deaths per 100,000 (41 deaths) in 2016 to 14 per 100,000 26State of Ottawa's Health Report - 20230 104 58% 65% 1 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Percentage (%)Ottawa Ontario less Ottawa 50% 69% 60%7 18-44 year year population aged 18 and older with a BMI estimate of overweight or obese in 2019-2020 by region, sex and age.

Source: Canadian Community Health Survey 2005-2019/2020, Statistics Canada, Share File, Ontario Ministry of HealthState of Ottawa's Health Report - 202327(148 deaths) in 2021. Preliminary data from 2022 (Q1-Q2) indicate that opioid-related morbidity and mortality remain higher than what was observed pre-pandemic (Figure 15) 72 Rates of opioid-related emergency department (ED) visits in Ottawa from 2003 until 2016 were similar for males and females but increased markedly among males after 2017. Rates of opioid-related deaths were higher in males, with more than twice the rate of deaths compared to females in 2021. Hospitalization rates have fluctuated over time (2003-2021) ranging from 3.2 per 100,000 to 12.8 per 100,000 and averaged higher in females. However, the average hospitalization rate since 2016 has been highest for males. Across age groups, from 2003 to 2021, opioid-related mortality rates were highest among residents of Ottawa aged 25 to 44 and 45 to 65 years. Hospitalization rates in 2020 and 2021 have also been highest among those aged 25 to 44 years old. Prior to the pandemic, rates had been highest among those 65 years and older. Rates for ED visits by age have fluctuated over time but were highest among younger residents (15 to 24 and 25 to 44 years old) from 2014 to 2021. The impact of the pandemic on opioids has been seen in Ottawa. Supervised consumption and treatment services treated more than twice as many non-fatal overdoses in 2021 compared to 2020 (1707 vs. 505). 73Needle and syringe program sites also had more than five times as many visits for harm reduction supplies and/or services in 2021 compared to 2017 (147,144 vs. 29,441). 74 In Ottawa, the most common type of opioid found at death continues to be fentanyl in 83% of deaths and deaths were predominately accidental in nature. 75This is not different than what is seen in Ontario. In Ottawa, 72% of opioid overdose deaths from January 2018 to June of 2021 involved a stimulant like cocaine as a direct contributor to the death. 76Alcohol In 2022, new alcohol use risk guidelines were devel- oped by the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction. 77These guidelines changed to a continuum of risk (no/low, moderate and high) rather than the 2011 guideline which was a threshold of exceeding or not exceeding the guidelines. The 2022 guidelines attribute no or low risk to two drinks or less per week, moderate risk to more than two to six drinks per week and high risk to more than six drinks per week. Using the new threshold, an estimated 69% of the population aged 19 and older in Ottawa are at no or low risk of alcohol related harms, 15% are at moderate risk and 16% are at high risk. 78Figure 16 shows the percent of the population aged 19 and older in Ottawa who are at no or low risk. Those most likely to be at no or low risk include females, those with neither French or English as a mother tongue, those in lowest income, those with less than a high school education, and those from racialized communities (Figure 17). Binge drinking, defined as more than 5 drinks on one occasion for males or more than 4 on one occasion for females, has health and safety risks including alcohol poisoning, risk of injury or violence, unplanned sex, worsening of mental health conditions, and suicide. 79 This is in addition to the risk to physical and substance use health. An estimated 35% of people living in Ottawa aged 12 and older said they engaged in binge drinking at least once in the past year and 15% said they binge drank at least once a month in the past year. Further, 5% said they engaged in binge drinking 2 to 3 times per month, with an additional 4%* stating they did so once a week or more. 80 In Ottawa, 5% of drivers said they had operated a motor vehicle within 2 hours of ingesting alcohol and 5% of those aged 12 and older said they were a passenger in a vehicle where the operator had consumed alcohol in the past 2 hours. 8128State of Ottawa's (per 100,000 people) Year - QuarterEmergency Department Visits 15.

Source: Canadian Community Health Survey 2019-2020, Statistics Canada, Share File, Ontario Ministry of Health Cannabis In October of 2018, cannabis became legal to consume and possess for Canadians of legal age. In 2019/2020, an estimated 22% of people living in Ottawa aged 19 and older used cannabis more than once in the past year. 82This is not different than the estimate for the rest of Ontario (21%). In Ottawa, such use is higher among males, people aged 19 to 44, people with English as a mother tongue and people who are not immigrants (Figure 18). In terms of frequency of use, 7% of residents of Ottawa used cannabis more than once per week. Of those who have used cannabis in the past 12 months, an estimated 7%* were considered \"dependent\" using the Severity of Dependence Scale for cannabis. This is not different compared to the rest of Ontario. xv People who have smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime are excluded.Smoking In 2019/2020, 9% of Ottawa residents aged 19 and older identified as a current smoker, xveither smoking daily or occasionally, down from 15% in 2017/2018.83 84This continues the decreasing trend in smoking over time and is significantly less than the estimate of 13% for Ontario-less-Ottawa (Figure 19). Smoking rates tend to be higher in males, those living alone, those with low-est educational achievement, those living in low income, and people who are renters versus owners (Figure 20). Daily smoking continued to decrease in 2019/2020 with an estimated 7% of people living in Ottawa reporting they were daily smokers, lower than 10% in the rest of Ontario (Figure 21). These rates have declined consis-tently since 2013/2014 in Ottawa. Daily smoking rates are highest among males, those living in lowest income, those living alone and those who are renting (Figure 22).30State of Ottawa's Health Report - 2023022% 22% 31% 17% 6%4.0 10 20 30 40 50 (%)0.9 6.8 5.3 2.7*Ottawa Ontario less Ottawa 16% 28%Female Male Not Racialized Racialized12-19 olds 20-44 year olds45-64 year olds 65+ year olds5.5 Not a newcomer Newcomer within past 10 years Newcomer over 10 years ago 8%27% 26% 11%36% 4.9 2003 2005 2007 20082009 20102011201220132014201520162017201820192020Con/f_idence of population aged 19 years and older who have used cannabis more than once in the past year by subgroup, 2019-2020.

There are an esti-mated 1,004 deaths, 3,573 hospitalizations and 6,234 emergency department visits in residents of Ottawa residents annually due to tobacco use in those aged 35 and older. 85 Substance Use Among Students Past Year Substance Use In 2021, past year use (3%*) by Ottawa students in grades 7 to 12 was similar both to the rest of Ontario, as well as to 2019, with the exception of vape/e-cigarette use which was significantly lower for Ottawa students relative to those in the rest of Ontario (16%) (Figure 23). 86, 87 xvi Binge drinking is defined as consuming 4+ drinks on one occasion for females or 5+ drinks on one occasion for males.Overall, use of these substances in the past year was significantly higher among grade 9 to 12 students com-pared to those in grades 7 and 8; except for non-medical opioid use, which was reported equally between these grade categories. Other subgroups also showed significant differences in substance use, for example, the use of vapes/e-cigarettes was higher among males (12%) compared to females (7%), and both alcohol and vape/e-cigarette use was reported by more students who identified as non-racialized (37% and 11%,* respectively) compared to people who identified as racialized (18% vs. 5%*). In 2021, only 6%* of Ottawa students in grades 9 to 12 reported binge drinking xviin the past month, which was a significant decrease compared to 2019 (19%*). How-ever, this difference may likely be a result of restrictions to social gatherings due to the COVID-19 pandemic throughout much of 2021.State of Ottawa's Health Report - 20233301020304050Percentage (%) Alcohol Cannabis Tobacco cigarettesVapes / e-cigarettesOttawa Percentage of students in grades 7 to 12 who reported using substances in the past year in Ottawa, 2019 and 2021, and Ontario-less-Ottawa, 2021.

About half (52%) of students in grades 7 to 12 reported that it would be fairly or very easy to obtain a vaping device if they wanted one (Figure 24). 8990 Impaired Driving In 2021, 7% of Ottawa students in grades 7 to 12 reported that in the past year they had been a passenger in a vehicle driven by someone who had consumed alcohol, which was a significant decrease from 2019 (21%). About one in 10 (12%) of students reported they had been a passenger with someone who had consumed drugs (excluding alcohol) in 2019 (estimate not reportable for 2021). 9192, , Estimates for the proportion of Ottawa students who drove a vehicle within an hour of consuming either alcohol or cannabis were not reportable for 2021 or 2019.

Alcohol, Smoking and Cannabis Use During Pregnancy One in forty (2.5%, 242) residents of Ottawa who gave birth in 2021 reported drinking alcohol during their pregnancy, representing a small decline in consumption compared to recent years (e.g., 4.6% in 2014; 4.6% in 2017; 3.7% in 2019). 93 Approximately one in thirty (3.5%, 329) residents of Ottawa women who gave birth in 2018 reported smoking close to the time of their child's birth. 9434State of Ottawa's Health Report - 2023020406080100Percentage (%) Alcohol Cannabis Tobacco cigarettesVapes / e-cigarettesOttawa Percentage of students in grades 7 to 12 who reported that it would be fairly or very easy to obtain substances in Ottawa, 2019 and 2021, and Ontario-less-Ottawa, 2021.

Many people face stigma because of their race, religion, gender, sexuality, economic situation, and a variety of other factors including their substance use health or mental health. 96Unfortunately, stigma is one of the biggest barriers preventing people experiencing challenges with mental health, addictions and substance use health from seeking and receiving appropriate health care and support. In November 2021, the results of an OPH survey to gain a better understanding of the stigma that exists in the community around mental health and substance use health indicated that 90% or more of residents understood that mental health conditions and substance use health conditions can affect anyone, and that people living with these conditions need the right treatment and support and are deserving of health care. 97However, there were some indications that stigma continues to be a barrier. For example, less than half (46%) of residents reported they would hire someone with a substance use disorder, and one in six (17%) reported they would not feel comfortable working with someone with a substance use disorder.

PERCEIVED HEALTH Approximately 65% of Ottawa residents aged 12 and older rated their general health as very good to excellent, similarly to the rest of Ontario. 98An estimated 9% or (78,000 people) rate their health as fair to poor. Self-rated general health tends to be lower among those aged 65 and older, those living alone, and those living in the lowest income quintile (Figure 25). In 2019, 93% of parents/caregivers of children aged 2 to 5 years living in Ottawa reported their child's health as excellent or very good and 93% of parents/caregivers of children aged 5 to 11 yearsreported their child's health as excellent or very good. 99In 2021, less than half (48%) of Ottawa students in grades 7 to 12 reported their physical health as very good or excellent; this was similar to the rest of Ontario, but significantly lower than in 2019 (61%) prior to the pandemic. 100, 101 CHRONIC CONDITIONS Self-reported chronic conditions for people in Ottawa aged 18 and older and aged 65 and older are shown in Table 4. Chronic disease prevalence tends to be higher in those aged 65 and older, which is not surprising, however for both age groups, arthritis and high blood pressure are the most prevalent chronic condition. Of note, anxiety and mood disorders are reported at similar proportions as asthma or diabetes in those aged 18 and older. Figure 25.

Cancer Incidence Table 5 presents a summary of the leading types of cancer in Ottawa in 2018, including counts of diagnoses of cancer by cancer type, sex, and comparison to Ontario-less- Ottawa. Cancer rates estimates are adjusted for differences in age structure between Ottawa and the rest of Ontario. The incidence rate due to all cancers combined was similar in Ottawa compared to the rest of Ontario (499.5 per 100,000 vs. 506.4 per 100,000). The top five cancers with the highest incidence rates in Ottawa were prostate, breast, lung, colorectal, and uterine cancer. Incidence of melanoma was significantly higher in Ottawa compared to the rest of Ontario (27.1 per 100,000 vs. 22.7 per 100,000). Incidence was significantly lower in Ottawa compared to the rest of Ontario for cancers of the thyroid (14.7 per 100,000 vs. 21.7 per 100,000) and kidney (12.5 per 100,000 vs. 16.4 per 100,000). Cancer Mortality Table 6 presents a summary of the leading cancer deaths in Ottawa in 2018, including counts of deaths by cancer type, sex and comparison to Ontario-less-Ottawa. The cancer mortality rates are adjusted for differences in age structure between Ottawa and the rest of Ontario. The mortality rate from all cancers combined was similar in Ottawa compared to Ontario-less-Ottawa in 2018 (180 per 100,000 vs. 185.4 per 100,000). The most common cancer deaths were attributable to lung, colorectal, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancer. Mortality rates for breast cancer were significantly higher in Ottawa compared to the rest of Ontario (16.0 per 100,000 vs. 12.6 per 100,000). LEADING CAUSES OF EMERGENCY DEPART-MENT VISITS In 2021, Ottawa residents made 327,086 visits to the emergency department (ED).102The top ten leading causes of these visits are shown in Figure 26. Injuries (e.g., falls, self-harm, collisions, overdose and poisoning, burns, cuts, overexertion) were the leading cause of ED visits in all age groups.38State of Ottawa's Health Report - 2023Table 5.

Neighbourhoods with the lowest socioeconomic advantage have the highest rates of hospitalization for all five causes when compared to the most advantaged neighbourhoods (Figure 27).LEADING CAUSES OF DEATHS At the time this report was prepared, data on deaths beyond 2015 was not available. Information beyond what is already published on the OPH website is not currently available. More recent mortality data will be analysed and published at a future date.

Figure 28 shows the causes of injury by percent of injury-related ED visits and hospitalizations as a percent of injuries in 2021.104Only causes that represent 5% or more of either ED visits or hospitalizations are shown. Falls contributed most to the burden of injury for both injury-related ED visits (39%) and hospitalizations (70%). Sport and recreation injuries contributed the second highest burden of injury-related ED visits (12%) and self-harm contributing the second highest burden of injury-related hospitalizations (13%). This is similar to patterns seen in previous reports. Across the lifespan, falls were the leading cause of injury- related ED visits. For those aged under 25 years, sport and recreation related injuries were the second highest contributor. Among those aged 25 to 64, cuts were the second most common, and for those 65 and older, being struck against or by something was second most common reason for injury-related ED visits. Falls were the leading cause of injury-related hospital-izations in all age groups except in those aged 15 to 44 where self-harm is the leading cause. Both leading cause and second most common cause of hospitalization by age group is shown in Table 7. These rankings are similar to those reported in previous health status reports. Figure 28.

MENTAL HEALTH Mental health is the ability to feel, think and act in ways that help us enjoy life and cope with challenges. As life experiences and circumstances change, so can moods, thoughts, and sense of well-being, both positive and negative. Mental Health in the Community Sixty percent of residents of Ottawa aged 12 and older rated their mental health as very good or excellent in 2019/2020, an approximate 8 to 10% decrease from previous years. 105An estimated 12% (100,600 people) rated their mental health as fair to poor. Self-rated mental health tends to be lowest among females, those aged 20 to 44, those in the lowest two income quintiles, those living in an urban setting, renters and those living alone (Figure 29). The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant and negative impact on mental health, disruption of social networks, decreasing access to much-needed services or support as well as the effects of worry or fear associated with the pandemic. To assess the impact of the pandemic on mental health, OPH undertook a series of population surveys in June and October 2020, and November 2021. 106 107 108In June and October of 2020, only 28% of Ottawa residents rated their mental health as excellent or very good. While this improved to 43% in November of 2021, it is still well below the 2019/2020 population estimate of 60%. This latter estimate would include data from prior to the pandemic. During the pandemic, people living in Ottawa who tended to fair worse with regards to their mental health included people with disabilities, young adults, people who identify as racialized, those with lower household income and people who identify as 2SLGBTQQIA+. About a quarter (24%) of people living in Ottawa also reported that in the past two weeks they wanted to reach out for mental health support but did not know where to turn (Figure 30) highlighting an ongoing need for mental health resource promotion exists. Mental Health Among Students Ottawa students in grades 7 to 12 reported significantly poorer mental health and emotional wellness in 2021 compared to 2019 (pre-pandemic) 109, 110(see the OSDUHS 2021 report for detailed results). Almost half (44%) of students reported fair or poor mental health, 42% reported wanting to talk to someone in the past year but not knowing where to turn, and 33% reported that their ability to handle an unexpected crisis or difficult family or friend problem was fair or poor (Figure 31). Further, 16%* of Ottawa students reported seriously considering suicide in the past year (not different from the rest of Ontario or from 2019). In particular, high school students (grades 9 to 12), students of socioeconomic disadvantage, or those identifying as 2SLGBTQQIA+ reported poorer mental and emotional well-being compared to their counterparts. 11144 State of Ottawa's Health Report - 2023060% 65% 61% 50% 50%2 20 40 60 80 100 10 30 50 70 90 Percentage (%)1Ottawa Ontario less Ottawa 56% 64%Female Male Owner RenterQuintile 1 - Highest income Quintile 2 - Second highest income Quintile 3 - Medium income Quintile 4 - Second lowest income Quintile 5 - Lowest income5 Living alone Single parent Couple living with children Couple not living with children 69%62% 67%47% 45%71% 4Con/f_idence Intervals PercentageInterpret year olds 65+ year olds 8 8 8 858% 12 21127 79 9 9 Figure 29.

Mental Health Among Pregnant Individuals During pregnancy or after childbirth, some parents develop mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression, and these conditions can cause additional challenges for parents and their families. Among Ottawa residents who gave birth in 2022, close to a quarter (23%) reported a mental health concern during their pregnancy, up from 14% in 2014, and increasing year over year (Figure 32). 112 xvii A list of reportable diseases can be found at: https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/180135INFECTIOUS DISEASES The Ontario Health Protection and Promotion Actxvii requires that certain diseases of public health significance be reported when they are diagnosed, to help public health officials identify disease trends, and track and manage disease outbreaks. These communicable diseases are generally underreported. This can be due to people being diagnosed based on symptoms rather than a laboratory test. People may not be severely ill and, as a result, do not seek testing or health care or that the disease agent can't be detected in the laboratory specimen.State of Ottawa's Health Report - 2023470510152025Percentage (%) Year2013 2014 Ottawa are organized into five major groups: 1) direct contact and respiratory infections including tuberculosis, 2) sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections, 3) vaccine preventable diseases, 4) enteric, food and water-borne infections and 5) vector-borne and other zoonotic infections. Direct Contact and Respiratory Infections, Including Tuberculosis Respiratory infections and diseases transmitted by direct contact are spread from person to person through droplets in the air (e.g., from a person coughing or sneezing) or through direct contact with an infected person. The epide-miology and symptoms of each disease vary depending on the infectious agent. Ontario has an annual universal influenza immunization program to offer vaccination against seasonal influenza. xviii Legionellosis is a disease caused by the Legionella bacteria that can result in serious pneumonia (Legionnaires' disease). xix Blastomycosis is caused by the inhalation of Blastomyces fungal spores. It primarily affects the lungs but can be systemic. Symptoms can include fever and cough, and can be serious if not treated.In addition, vaccines against common serogroups of invasive meningococcal disease, invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilis influenza are part of the publicly funded immunization schedule. Overall Trends There was a decrease in incidence of some direct contact and respiratory diseases reported to OPH during the COVID-19 pandemic that persisted into 2022 (e.g. invasive group A streptococcal disease), while others increased (e.g. tuberculosis, carbapenemase-producing enterobac-teriaceae, legionellosis, blastomycosis) compared to the pre-pandemic average (Figure 33). Legionellosisxviiiappears to have increased over time, likely due to the increased use of less invasive diagnostic methods. Incidence of legionellosis was lower in Ottawa (1.6 per 100,000) than the average of Ontario-less-Ottawa (2.2 per 100,000). Blastomycosis xixhas increased from 4 people Figure 32.

Incidence of blastomycosis was higher in Ottawa (0.93 per 100,000) than the average of Ontario-less-Ottawa (0.69 per 100,000), although still many times lower than hyperendemic areas in North-western Ontario (50 per 100,000). The incidences of Carbapenamase-producing enterobacteriaceae (CPE) xx and group B streptococcal diseasexxi were similar to the average incidences in Ontario-less-Ottawa during 2022. xx CPE are a group of bacteria that have become resistant to many antibiotics. Infections caused by CPE can be difficult to treat. xxi Group B streptococcus bacteria are usually harmless in healthy adults but can cause serious disease in newborns. xxii Most Group A strep infections are mild illnesses like strep throat or impetigo. Sometimes the bacteria can invade the lungs, blood or tissues around the muscle causing very serious, sometimes life-threatening disease.In June 2022, mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) became reportable as a Disease of Public Health Significance. The disease was not previously circulating in Canada. Please refer to the mpox section for more details. Invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS) The incidence of invasive group A streptococcus (iGAS),xxii caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, reported to OPH was Figure 33.

Integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS), Ontario Ministry of Health. Extracted March 13, 2023. Notes: Three (3) additional people reported with confirmed blastomycosis from 2022 were pending confirmation in iPHIS and are not represented above. Blastomycosis counts may include people meeting the probable case definition in addition to people meeting the laboratory confirmed case definition.State of Ottawa's Health Report - 202349stable from 2017 through to 2019 (Figure 34). The rates of iGAS dropped in 2020, likely due to COVID-19-related public health measures such as handwashing and the absence of seasonal respiratory viruses which make people more susceptible to secondary bacterial infections. Rates rose in 2021 and 2022 following the decrease in COVID-19 prevention measures together with increases in respiratory viral infections. The incidence of iGAS in Ottawa (4.9 per 100,000) was lower than the average of Ontario-less-Ottawa (which had 5.7 cases diagnosed per 100,000) in 2022. People diagnosed with iGAS in 2022 were predominantly male (66%) and were over age 40 years (75%). Chronic skin conditions, and drug and alcohol use were the most common risk factors identified, but those most at risk for severe infections and fatalities were those with immune deficiencies. The proportion of people with iGAS who were underhoused more than doubled from 18% in 2017 to 45% in 2022. Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD) In the past 10 years, there have been five or fewer annual cases of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD)xxiiireported in Ottawa due to routine immunization in Ontario during infancy and at 12 years of age beginning in 2009. In the school year 2020-21, approximately 96% of 17-year-olds in Ottawa had been vaccinated against meningococcal disease (see Childhood Immunization). 113 In 2022, the incidence of IMD (0.5 per 100,000) was the highest it has been in the last ten years and higher than the average of Ontario-less-Ottawa (0.1 per 100,000). 114 This increase was likely due to loosening of COVID-19 public health measures that resulted in close, unmasked contact with a larger number of people and higher rates of viral respiratory disease which makes people suscepti-ble to secondary bacterial infections. 115 xxiii A serious illness that results when Neisseria meningitidis bacteria invade the blood or tissues around the brain and cause serious disease like meningi- tis or septicemia. xxiv Reports of active TB and LTBI are all recorded by date of diagnosis. For example, if a person was diagnosed in 2020 and successfully treated the successful treatment date would be 2020, rather than in year in which treatment was actually completed. The same applies to all other outcomes including fatalities.Tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) is an infection caused by a group of Mycobacterium bacteria species, which primarily infects the lungs but can also infect other parts of the body. In 2022, 59 cases of active TB, or 5.5 per 100,000, were reported among Ottawa residents. xxivThe rate of activeTB in Ottawa has increased over the last six years (Figure 35) and it is higher than the average for Ontar-io-less-Ottawa (4.6 per 100,000). 116Indigenous peoples in Canada are disproportionally affected by TB due to ongoing impacts of colonization and health inequities. 117 The average age at diagnosis was 46 years. Roughly half (52%) of people diagnosed with TB had pulmonary disease. The major risk factor for TB was living in or travelling to an endemic area. 118Of residents of Ottawa diagnosed with TB in 2022, most (73%) were born outside Canada, similar to previous years. Among Canadian-born individuals in Ottawa, Inuit are disproportionately affected by TB. In 2022, 8% of the cases of TB in Ottawa were in individuals who identify as Inuk. This disproportionate burden of TB illness is also seen elsewhere in Canada. Among Inuit living within Inuit Nunangat, the rate of TB was 40 times the rate for Canada as a whole (189/100,00 vs. 4.7/100,000) and more than 400 times the rate for the Canadian-born, non-Indigenous population (189/100,000 vs. 0.4/100,000) in 2019. 119 Case fatality rates, the proportion of people infected who die from TB, have fluctuated slightly over the last 10 years, with an average of 6%, compared with the Canadian case fatality rate of 5% from 2010 - 2019. At the time of this report, no deaths from TB have been recorded for people diagnosed in 2022. 120Ottawa Public Health works closely with individuals as they are treated for TB and were able to support 93% through successful treatment according to the Canadian guidelines. 50State of Ottawa's Health Report - 202302468Rate (per 100,000) Year2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022Invasive Group A Streptococcal Disease Invasive Meningococcal Disease 02468Rate (per 100,000) Year2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022Figure 34.

It is estimated that about 5 to 10% of people with LTBI will have an active TB infection over their lifetime. The primary prevention strategy is screening for LTBI in people born outside of Canada, Indigenous people, and others who may be at high risk (e.g., immune compromised, unstable housing). The rates of LTBI in Ottawa dropped to 39 per 100,000 in 2020, likely due to decreased screening during the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2022, rates returned to 78 per 100,000, which is similar to what was observed pre-pandemic. 121 The rates of LTBI in Ottawa have been higher than the Ontario-less-Ottawa rates for the last 10 years. 122Of the people diagnosed in 2022,xxv55% were in females, and the average age at diagnoses was 39 years.123 Influenza Influenza, commonly known as the \"flu\", is a respiratory infection caused by the influenza virus. Influenza can easily spread from person to person and influenza virus circulation follows a seasonal pattern with most infections reported between fall and spring. Annual influenza immunization is the most effective way to protect against influenza. Please refer to the OPH Respiratory and Enteric Surveillance Report dashboard for up-to-date influenza data presented alongside data on COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), outbreaks and all-cause and respiratory-related emergency department visits to Ottawa hospitals. xxvi xxv As of March 13, 2023, there were still 478 cases requiring entry into the provincial case reporting system, iPHIS. Counts, averages, and rates for 2022 have been manually adjusted to include these missing cases for the purposes of the report. However, sex and age information are not reflective of the 478 cases pending entry into iPHIS. Please interpret with caution. xxvi Testing for influenza and RSV is limited to patients hospitalized due to respiratory illness and symptomatic individuals in health care institutions (i.e. long-term care homes, retirement homes, public hospitals), while COVID-19 testing is currently more widely available additionally to health care work-ers and high risk individuals. Testing does not capture the majority of people who become ill with reportable diseases in Ottawa. Prior to November 14, 2022, testing for influenza and RSV in health care institutions was limited to the first four symptomatic individuals in a suspect outbreak. xxvii Based on the influenza percent positivity for Eastern Ontario exceeding 5%. xxviii CHEO. Viral season and you: How you can help. Updated December 12, 2022 at https://www.cheo.on.ca/en/news/viral-season-and-you-how-you-can- help.aspx . Accessed March 14, 2023Influenza activity in spring of 2020 declined suddenly and dramatically due to the introduction of COVID-19-related public health measures. Activity remained very low for two years until a slight increase was noted in the spring of 2022 (31 lab-confirmed cases in April and May) associated with the lifting of public health measures. Influenza activity during the 2022-2023 influenza season (the period from September 2022 to August 2023) began xxvii the week of October 30, 2022, five weeks earlier than the pre-COVID-19 average (Figure 36). 124The influenza season rapidly peaked in early December and declined to levels typically seen in late spring or summer by mid-January, resulting in a shorter season. As of mid-March 2023, 870 Ottawa residents tested positive for influenza (99% influenza A and 1% influenza B), slightly above the pre-pandemic average of 833. Children and youth were disproportionately impacted with 40% of people who tested positive being under the age of 20 years, resulting in a median age of 34 years, which is significantly younger than pre-pandemic seasons where the median age was typically 60 years or older. The influenza rate among children aged 1 to 4 years this season (322 per 100,000) was more than triple the pre-pandemic average (105 per 100,000). Co-circulation of influenza, RSV, COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses in fall 2022 resulted in an unprece-dented surge in emergency department visits and admissions to CHEO. xxviii52State of Ottawa's Health Report - 2023020406080100120140160 wk 35 - 28 Aug wk 37 - 11 Sep wk 39 - 25 Sep wk 41 - 09 Octwk 43 - 23 Oct wk 45 - 06 Novwk 47 - 20 Nov wk 49 - 04 Decwk 51 - 18 Dec wk 1 - 01 Janwk 3 - 15 Janwk 5 - 29 Jan wk 7 - 12 Febwk 9 - 26 Feb wk 11 - 12 Marwk 13 - 26 Mar wk 15 - 09 Aprwk 17 - 23 Apr wk 19 - 07 Maywk 21 - 21 May wk 23 - 04 Junwk 25 - 18 Jun wk 27 - 02 Julwk 29 - 16 Julwk 31 - 30 Jul wk 33 - 13 Augwk 35 - 27 AugNumber of Confirmed Infections Episode Week2022-2023 2021-2022 2020-2021 2019-2020 Pre-COVID 3 Season Average Figure 36.

Influenza Vaccination Each fall, the Universal Influenza Immunization Program makes influenza vaccination available to all residents 6 months of age or older. During the 2020-21 influenza season, half (50%) of Ottawa residents aged 18 years and older reported receiving an influenza vaccination while 74% of residents aged 65 years and older received an influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccination was lower for older adults in the 2020-21 season than in previous seasons (Figure 37). 125 COVID-19 Cases, hospitalizations, and deaths COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 spreads from an infected person to others through respiratory droplets of varying size, including aerosols, and through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects without proper hand hygiene. The first laboratory confirmation COVID-19 infection was reported to Ottawa Public Health on March 9, 2020. Since the beginning of the pandemic through December 2022, there have been 88,012 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection among the people living in Ottawa, 3,464 hospitalizations, and 1,001 deaths due to COVID-19 or as a contributing cause of death. 126In 2022, there were 39,671 cases of COVID-19 infections, 1,702 hospitaliza-tions, and 381 deaths. However, the number of COVID-19 infections reported after December 2021 are significantly underestimated due to restrictions placed on testing eligibility. There were six distinct waves of infection between March 2020 and April 2022. The first wave saw the highest rates among those 65 years of age and older, with many outbreaks in long-term care and retirement homes. Further community spread led to the implementation of public health restrictions to control the rising number of cases. These included the closing of schools and non-essential businesses, limited State of Ottawa's Health 1118-64 year olds 65+ year olds social gatherings, travel restrictions, capacity limits, closure of indoor dining, and the requirement to wear masks in indoor public spaces. The provincial measures introduced over the course of the pandemic are shown in Figure 38. COVID-19 Vaccination A COVID-19 vaccine became available in December 2020. When the vaccine was first introduced, eligibility was limited to populations at highest risk, including long-term care home and retirement home residents, and health-care workers required for the pandemic response. Within 3 months, 90% of retirement and long-term care home residents were fully vaccinated (with two doses), and within 9 months and as eligibility expended, 80% of all eligible residents of Ottawa were fully vaccinated. 127 As of March 2023, 85% of the Ottawa population has had at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, 82% at least two doses, 56% at least three doses and 31% at least four doses. Vaccination rates increase with age and have been very low among those age 6 months to 4 years and 5 to 11 years. Ottawa has the third highest COVID-19 vaccination coverage in the province. For more up-to-date statistics on COVID-19 vaccination coverage, please visit Ottawa Public Health's COVID-19 Vaccination Dashboard . Health disparities in COVID-19 epidemiology and vaccination The structural and systemic inequities and barriers that pre-existed the COVID-19 pandemic influenced its epidemi-ology and vaccine uptake. The rate of COVID-19 infection was higher among residents of less-advantaged communities (Figure 39). These communities are not inherently more susceptible to COVID-19, but underlying social realities, such as systemic racism, barriers to health information and services, and/or participation in occupations without access to paid sick leave, contributed to people's exposure to COVID-19. COVID-19 case rates are shown in three different time periods throughout the pandemic: (A) pre COVID-19 vaccination; (B) when 60% of Ottawa residents are protected by COVID-19 and before the arrival of Omicron; and (C) after the arrival of Omicron. Disparities are less evident during the latter two time periods.Figure 37. Percentage of Ottawa adults reporting influenza immunization by age group and influenza season, 2013/14 to 2020/21.

The population rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths was also higher in communities with less socioeconomic advantage as described by the Ottawa Neighbourhood Study SES index. Population hospitalization and death rates were almost three times higher in quintile 5 neighborhoods (lowest socioeconomic status) compared to those in quintile 1 neighbourhoods (highest socioeconomic status). While the latter two time periods showed less disparity in infection rates (Figure 40), 128hospitalization and death rates remained higher in less advantaged neighborhoods compared to most advantaged neighborhoods across all time periods (Figure 41). Similar findings have been seen across Ontario.Despite efforts to prioritize lower income neighbourhoods, COVID-19 vaccination was also unevenly distributed across socioeconomic levels in Ottawa. Neighbourhoods that are more socioeconomically advantaged generally experienced higher levels of vaccination compared with neighbourhoods with lower socioeconomic advantage The disparity is greater among younger populations.

Extracted March 22, 2023.State of Ottawa's Health Report - 202357Mpox During 2022, a global outbreak of mpoxxxix (pronounced \"em-pox\" and formerly known as \"monkeypox\") occurred and included countries that have not historically reported mpox cases. The first person with of mpox was reported in Ottawa in May 2022. In total, 42 cases were diagnosed in Ottawa residents between May and September 2022 (Figure 42).The incidence of mpox in Ottawa was lower than the average of Ontario-less-Ottawa in 2022, which was driven by a high percentage of cases in Toronto. Almost all cases of mpox were in gay, bisexual and other men who reported sex with other men (GBOMSM), most of whom recently had a new sexual partner, more than one sexual partner, or anonymous sex. Imvamune, a two-dose vaccine approved for the prevention of mpox, became available in June 2022. Over 4,600 Ottawa residents were vaccinated with one dose of Imvamune between June 2022 and February 2023; a little over a third (37%) of those receiving a first dose, have also received a second dose. A second dose of the mpox vaccine is recommended to provide the best protection. Sexually Transmitted and Blood-Borne Infections (STBBIs) Sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs) are spread through body fluids (e.g., blood, vaginal fluid, semen) or skin-to-skin contact during sexual contact, while others are spread through non-sexual activities such as sharing needles used for injecting drugs. Certain infections can be transmitted both through blood and sexual contact, such as hepatitis B, HIV, and rarely, hepatitis C. Reportable sexually transmitted infections include chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, and rarely, hepatitis C. Reportable blood-borne infections include hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV. xxix Mpox is viral disease that cause a variety of symptoms including a rash, skin lesions, and flu-like symptoms including fever, headache, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue. xxx Chlamydia is a bacterial sexually transmitted infection that can occur in both men and women. Infections can be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Infertility can be a complication of infection in women. xxxi Gonorrhea is a bacterial infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacterium, which can be symptomatic or asymptomatic. If untreated, it can cause serious health problems.Overall Trends Trends in sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections are associated with factors such as age, ethnicity, income, gender, and sexual orientation. Populations most affected by STBBIs in Ottawa include: youth; gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBOMSM); people who use drugs; and people who come from a country where infection is common. The incidence of STBBIs decreased during the pandemic, most likely due to decreased testing and/or decreased sexual contacts (Figure 43). Recently, rates have begun to rebound to pre-pandemic (2017-19) levels (Figures 44 and 45). Chlamydia Chlamydiaxxxwas the most frequently reported of all reportable infections, after COVID-19. The incidence in 2022 was 284 infections per 100,000 population, corresponding to 3,084 cases (Figure 43). The rate of chlamydia in Ottawa was higher than the average of Ontario-less-Ottawa, which had 237 cases diagnosed per 100,000 in 2022. 129Most cases were in young adults ages 20 to 24 years who recently had, condomless sex with a partner of the opposite sex, a new sexual partner, or more than one sexual partner. Gonorrhea The incidence of gonorrheaxxxiin 2022 was 76 infections per 100,000 population, corresponding to 819 cases (Figure 43). The rate of gonorrhea in Ottawa was slightly higher than the average of Ontario-less-Ottawa, which had 72 cases diagnosed per 100,000 in 2022. 130Most cases are in people who recently had condomless sex, a new sexual partner, or more than one sexual partner. Almost half of cases are among GBOMSM. 58State of Ottawa's Health Report - 202302004006008001000 05101520 number vaccinatednumber of cases weekdiagnosed vaccinated Figure 42.

Syphilis The incidence of syphilisxxxiiin 2022 was 23 infections per 100,000 population, corresponding to 248 cases (Figure 43). Syphilis has an infectious (earlier infection) and a late latent (later infection) stage. Approximately 40% of 2022 cases were infectious; most of the remainder were latent infections. The rate of infectious syphilis in males was 22 per 100,000 population and 2 per 100,000 in females. The rate of syphilis in Ottawa was lower than the average of Ontario-less-Ottawa, which had 33 cases diag-nosed per 100,000 in 2022. 131Approximately three-quarters of infectious cases were in adult GBOMSM. The most common risk factor was recent anonymous sex. Among those diagnosed with a late latent infection for whom origin is known, 85% were born outside Canada. Congenital xxxii Syphilis is a bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can present with a number of different symptoms, depending on stage of illness and cause serious health problems without treatment. xxxiii Hepatitis C is an infection by the hepatitis C virus that can result in liver inflammation and damage.

Hepatitis C The incidence of hepatitis Cxxxiiiin 2022 was 22 infections per 100,000 population, corresponding to 240 cases (Figure 43). Many people with a hepatitis C infection are diagnosed later in their infection since someone can live with hepatitis C for many years (20-30 years) before developing symptoms. Approximately 60% of infections diagnosed in 2022 were older infections, a quarter were new infections, and timing for the remainder could not be determined. The rate of hepatitis C in Ottawa was higher than the average of Ontario-less-Ottawa, which had 16 cases diagnosed per 100,000 in 2022. 132Approximately one-quarter of people diagnosed in 2022 reported being homeless or underhoused.

Ninety-eight percent of hepatitis B infections were not recently acquired; approximately 70% of these diagnoses were among people born in a coun-try where hepatitis B is more common. 133The rate of hepatitis B in Ottawa was more than twice the average of Ontario-less-Ottawa (which had 6 cases diagnosed per 100,000 in 2022). 134There were only two cases of recently acquired infection in 2022, owing in large part to a provincial school-based vaccination program that began in 1994. In 2020-2021, approximately 80% of 17-year-olds in Ottawa had been vaccinated against hepatitis B. 135Figure 45. Incidence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, syphilis by year in Ottawa, 2017 to 2022.

Many people with an HIV infection are diagnosed later in their infection, as someone can live with HIV for a long time before developing symptoms. Approximately 50% of infections diagnosed in 2022 were older infections, approximately 12% were new infections, and timing for the remainder could not be determined. The rate of HIV in Ottawa was lower than the average of Ontario- less-Ottawa, which had 5 cases diagnosed per 100,000 in 2022. 136Populations most represented among people with HIV infection were those born in, or with a sexual partner from, a country where HIV is common; and GBOMSM. Vaccine Preventable Diseases Vaccine preventable diseases (e.g., measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, polio) are an area of considerable focus for public health programs because they are highly contagious and can cause severe disease, particularly in un-vaccinated or under-vaccinated infants and young children. In general, reports of vaccine-preventable diseases to OPH have been uncommon because of effective immu-nization programs and high immunization coverage. Ensuring vaccination rates remain high is important in preventing the spread of vaccine preventable diseases. Overall Trends The most frequently reported routine vaccine-preventable diseases in 2022 were invasive pneumococcal disease (77 cases), chickenpox (varicella) (21 cases) and invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease (11 cases). There were more people reported with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and chickenpox in 2022 than the average during pre-pandemic years (2017 to 2019). For the first time in over 10 years, a person in Ottawa was diagnosed with tetanus in 2022. Finally, there were no people reported with the other vaccine-preventable diseases of public health significance, including measles, pertussis, polio, rubella, and smallpox, in Ottawa in 2022. xxxv HIV is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. There is no cure for HIV, but medication can control infection and prevent progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).The Ottawa rate of IPD (7.1 per 100,000) and invasive Haemophilus influenza disease (1.0 per 100,000) are slightly lower than Ontario-less-Ottawa, but provincial data for chickenpox are not available for comparison (Figure 46). 137 Pneumococcal Disease Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is caused by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, of which there are 90 known serotypes. Invasive disease often presents as pneumonia, sepsis (blood poisoning) or meningitis, and a recent influenza infection can increase the risk of IPD. 138 Reports of Ottawa residents with IPD declined during 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 related public health measures. The rates fully rebounded to pre-pandemic levels in 2022. The Ottawa incidence rate (7.1 per 100,000) was slightly lower than the average of Ontario-less-Ottawa (7.9 per 100,000) in 2022. 139In 2022, 18% of people reported with IPD were infants and children aged 9 years and under and 42% were adults older than 60 years. Pneumococcal vaccines are offered, as part of Ontario's publicly funded schedule, to infants, older adults, and high-risk groups. These vaccines protect against some serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The volume of Pneumococcal Conjugate 13 (Pneu-C-13) vaccines, routinely administered to infants, distributed to health care providers in OPH's catchment was relatively stable over the course of the pandemic. Distribution volumes in 2020-2022 were 3% to 5% lower than the pre-pandemic 2-year average doses distributed (2018-2019), indicating some backlog in children requiring immunization. The volume of Pneumococcal Polysaccharide 23 (Pneu-P-23) vaccines, typically administered to older adults 65 years and older and those with certain immunosuppressive conditions, dropped dramatically in 2020 and 2021 (by 27% and 35%, respectively) compared to pre-pandemic. These volumes made a marked recovery in 2022, back to within 5% of pre-pandemic volumes; however, it is likely that many who became eligible during the pandemic have not yet been vaccinated. 62State of Ottawa's Health Report - 20230 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Number of people diagnosedPertussis (Whooping cough) Polio Rubella SmallpoxHaemophilus in/f_luenzae disease, all types, invasive Mumps77 71.7 21 15 11 1 1 15.7 0 00 00 000012.3Streptococcus pneumoniae, invasive Chickenpox to 2019)27 Figure 46.

Other jurisdictions in Ontario have reported cases of measles related to international travel by under-immunized residents in 2023. OPH is monitoring measles activity, preparing for potential measles cases, and encouraging routine vaccinations. State of Ottawa's Health Report - 202363Enteric, Food and Water-borne Infections Enteric or gastrointestinal (GI) illnesses are often acquired through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. They can also be transmitted from person-to-person through fecal-oral contact, and transmission among sexual partners is being increasingly recognized. Overall Trends Enteric illnesses most frequently reported in Ottawa in 2022, which make up 65% of all enteric illnesses reported, were salmonellosis (99 cases), campylobacter enteritis (96 cases), and giardiasis (87 cases) (Figure 47). While there were fewer people reported with most enteric infections in 2022 than the average during pre-pandemic years, there were more people reported with infections with listeriosis and typhoid fever. The increase in listeriosis and typhoid fever is partially owing to a listeriosis outbreak in a long-term care home (4 residents confirmed infected) and a locally- acquired typhoid fever outbreak (3 people confirmed infected in 2022) in the community. For the first time since 2017, one person was reported with cholera, related to travel outside Canada. The rates of salmonellosis (9.2 per 100,000) and Campylo- bacter enteritis (8.9 per 100,000) in Ottawa were lower than the equivalent averages of Ontario-less-Ottawa in 2022. 141The incidences of cryptosporidiosis (1.4 per 100,000), paratyphoid fever (0.2 per 100,000), and yersiniosis (0.7 per 100,000) were slightly lower than in the rest of Ontario in 2022. The incidences of giardiasis (8.1 per 100,000) and amebiasis (2.5 per 100,000) in Ottawa were higher than in the rest of Ontario in 2022. The incidence of hepatitis A (0.6 per 100,000) was similar to the rest of Ontario in 2022. xxxviii These diseases cause gastrointestinal/diarrheal illness and can cause severe dehydration or more serious complications. xxxix Cyclosporiasis is a parasitic disease that can cause diarrhea and other symptoms and may last weeks to a month or more if not treated. xl Shigellosis can result in watery or bloody diarrhoea and can cause serious complications like severe dehydration or septicemia in those with weakened immune systems. Salmonellosis, campylobacter enteritis and giardiasisxxxviii decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic and continued to remain lower in 2022 than pre-pandemic years (Figure 48).This is most likely due to fewer social gatherings involving food, decreased travel and/or decreased testing, and rates are expected to rise in 2023. The most common risk factor for salmonella and Campylo- bacter enteritis was consumption of poultry in a private home (52% of cases) and travel outside of Canada during the incubation period (36% of cases). Recreational water (e.g., swimming in a lake or river) is typically the most common cause of giardiasis. 142 Although enteric illnesses are reported throughout the year, a higher number of cases are reported during summer months (Figure 49). Seasonal patterns in enteric illnesses are often linked to increases in travel, warmer temperatures, outdoor activities, and social gatherings. Cyclosporiasis An increase in people reported with locally acquired cyclosporiasis xxxixhas been noted across Canada in recent years, associated with consumption of imported produce. In 2022, 54 cases of cyclosporiasis were reported in Ottawa, compared with 32 cases in 2018. 143Reports of people infected in 2022 increased in May, peaked in June, and declined by August. The incidence of cyclosporiasis in Ottawa (5.0 per 100,000) was higher than the average of Ontario-less-Ottawa (2.9 per 100,000) in 2022. 144 Shigellosis Shigellosis is a bacterial infection transmitted via the fecal-oral route from contaminated food or water and, increasingly, through sexual contact. xlRisk of spread increases for individuals engaging in anal-oral sex, and in settings where personal hygiene is limited such as in childcare centres.

Examples include Lyme disease, the bacterial agent of which is carried by the blacklegged tick, and West Nile virus (WNV), which is carried by certain mosquito species. Due to climate change, the presence of blacklegged ticks continues to increase in Ottawa. Overall Trends Lyme disease, WNV infection and Q fever were the only vector-borne diseases of public health significance reported among Ottawa residents in 2022 (Figure 50), with only one person with Q fever and WNV each reported in 2022. There were no people reported with the other vector-borne diseases of public health significance in Ottawa in 2022. T hese include anthrax, brucellosis, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, plague, rabies, and tularemia. Lyme Disease The City of Ottawa is an established Lyme diseasexlirisk area. Tick surveillance work conducted by the University of Ottawa estimated that 32% of black-legged ticks in xli Early symptoms of Lyme disease symptoms can include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. If left untreated, infection can spread to joints, the heart, and the nervous system. xlii Burrows H, Talbot B, McKay R, Slatculescu A, Logan J, et al. (2021) A multi-year assessment of blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) population establish-ment and Lyme disease risk in Ottawa, Canada, 2017-2019. PLOS ONE 16(2): e0246484. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.02464842019 Adult ticks were more likely than nymphal ticks to test positive, and ticks collected from the sites located within the Greenbelt zone, in the sub-urban/rural areas of the western portion of Ottawa and along the Ottawa river were more likely to test positive than ticks in the suburban/urban core. xlii In 2022, 215 people infected with Lyme disease were reported in Ottawa, compared with 50 reported in 2013 (Figure 51). Of the people reported in 2022 with Lyme disease, 31% reported exposure within Ottawa and 61% reported exposure outside of Ottawa within Ontario. Exposure was commonly associated with spending time outdoors at a private home or camping in neighbouring regions. When comparing the incidence rate of Lyme disease in 2022 to the three health units neighbouring Ottawa, the rate in Ottaw a was the lowest (range of 20.2/100,000 to 163.3/100,000). However, the incidence of Lyme disease in Ottawa (20.2 per 100,000) was higher than the average of Ontario-less-Ottawa (8.2 per 100,000) in 2022. 147 Rabies Although there have been no human cases of rabies in Ontario since 1967, the risk continues to exist. Bats have been found to be infected with rabies in Ottawa. Elsewhere in Ontario, raccoons, foxes, and skunks have been found to be infected with rabies. Importation of infected animals can be a source of rabies for local pet and domestic animals. Foreign travel also presents risk scenarios for Ottawa residents. All potential rabies exposures are risk assessed by OPH and rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (RPEP) is provided when indicated for the prevention of rabies in humans. In 2022, OPH, working alongside local health care providers, coordinated the distribution of RPEP doses to 195 individuals.State of Ottawa's Health Report - 2023670 50 100 150 200 250 Number of people in OttawaPlague Rabies (human infections) TularemiaWest Nile virus illness Anthrax215 154.3 1 0.7 0 00 00 00 00 001.39.3Lyme 1Q Fever Brucellosis Hantavirus 2022 Yearly pre-pandemic average (2017 to 2019) Figure 50.

Long-Term Care, Retirement Home, and Hospital Outbreaks Respiratory and gastroenteritis infection outbreaks in institutions are reportable to local public health authorities. This report summarizes outbreaks in hospitals, retirement homes and long term care homes: institutions where outbreak reporting is most reliable. As of March 20, 2023, the 2022-2023 outbreak season (the period from September 2022 to August 2023) has been predominated by COVID-19 outbreaks, while influenza, other respiratory outbreaks and enteric outbreaks partially rebounded after dropping during the previous two seasons. There have been 284 COVID-19 outbreaks in institutions since September 1st of 2022, the start of the current respiratory season, which is a greater number of outbreaks than were reported in the entire first respiratory season of the pandemic (231 outbreaks between September 2020 and August 2021) and more than season-to-date in the second season of the pandemic (187 outbreaks between September 2021 and March 2022). 148There have been 19 influenza A outbreaks and 46 other non-COVID respiratory outbreaks in Ottawa institutions (i.e., hospitals, long-term care homes, and retirement homes) during the 2022-2023 season-to-date. This is lower than the average of 100 respiratory outbreaks (including 46 influenza and 54 other respiratory outbreaks) seen in pre-pandemic seasons (2016-2017 through 2018-2019 weeks 35 through 11). 149 Finally, there have been 14 gastroenteritis outbreaks in institutions for the season-to-date, which is lower than the average of 42 gastroenteritis outbreaks seen in pre-pandemic seasons (2016-2017 through 2018-2019 weeks 35 through 11). 150 Please refer to the OPH Respiratory and Enteric Surveillance Report Dashboard for additional up-to-date summaries, to the OPH Outbreak Status Dashboard for a list of ongoing and recently closed confirmed respiratory and enteric outbreaks, and to the OPH COVID-19 Dashboard for details on COVID-19 outbreaks . 68 State of Ottawa's Health Report - 2023Appendix and ReferencesAPPENDIX Data Tables Data table for Figure 1.
