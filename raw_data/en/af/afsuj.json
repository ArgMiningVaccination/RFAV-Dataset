(a) The user shall ensure fluoroscopic equipment meets the following: (1) The tube housing shall be of diagnostic type. (2) The target -to-panel or target -to-table top distance should not be less than 18 inches and shall not be less than 12 inches. (3) The total ltration permanently in the useful beam shall not be less than 2.5 millimeters aluminum equivalent. This requirement may be assumed to have been met if the half -value layer is not less than 2.5 millimeters aluminum at normal operating voltages. (4) The equipment shall be so constructed that the entire cross -section of the useful beam is attenuated by a primary protective barrier. This barrier is usually the viewing device, either a conventional fluoroscopic screen or an image intensication mechanism. (A) The lead equivalent of the barrier of conventional fluoroscopes shall be at least 1.5 millimeters for equipment capable of operating up to 100 kVp, at least 1.8 millimeters for equipment whose maximum operating potential is greater than 100 kVp and less than 125 kVp, and at least 2.0 millimeters for equipment whose maximum operating potential is 125 kVp or greater. Special attention must be paid to the shielding of image intensiers so that neither the useful beam nor scattered radiation from the intensier can produce a radiation hazard to the operator or personnel. With the fluorescent screen 14 inches (35 cm) from the panel or table top, the exposure rate 2 inches (5 cm) beyond the viewing surface of the screen shall not exceed 30 mR/hr for each R per minute at the table top with the screen in the useful beam without a patient and with the fluo roscope operating at the highest potential employed. (B) Collimators shall be provided to restrict the size of the useful beam to less than the area of the barrier. For conventional fluoroscopes this requirement is met if, when the adjustable diaphragm is opened to its fullest extent, an unilluminated margin is left at all edges of the fluorescent screen with the screen centered in the beam at a distance of 35 cm (14 inches) from the panel or table top. For image intensied fluoroscopy, shutters shall be provided which can be adjusted to restrict the X -ray eld to the visible portion of the image receptor during fluoroscopy. For systems employing rectangular X-ray elds and circular image receptors, this requirement is met if the collimated beam forms a square which circumscribes, and is tangent to, the circular margin of the image receptor. (C) The tube mounting and the carrier shall be so linked together that the carrier always intercepts the entire useful beam. The X-ray exposure shall automatically terminate when the carrier is removed from the useful beam. (D) Collimators and adjustable diaphragm s or shutters to restrict the size of the useful beam shall provide the same degree of protection as is required of the tube housing. (5) The exposure switch shall be of the dead- man type. (6) Each fluoroscopic unit shall be equipped with a manual -reset cumulative timing device, activated by the exposure switch, which will either indicate elapsed exposure time by a signal audible to the fluorocopist or turn off the apparatus when the total exposure exceeds a predetermined limit not exceeding ve minutes in one or a series of exposures. (7) Useful beam exposure rate. (A) All fluoroscopic equipment. For routine fluorosc opy, the exposure rate measured at the point where the center of the useful beam enters a typical patient shall be as low as is practicable and shall not exceed 5roentgens per minute under the conditions specied herein. This limit shall not apply during magnication procedures or the recording of fluoroscopic images where higher exposure rates are required. Compliance with this 155 CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS \u00a7 30307 CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS paragraph shall be determined using the measuring specications of subsection (a)(7) (D), plus the following procedures when the automatic exposure rate control is used: 1. The useful beam exposure rate shall be measured with a phantom equivalent to 9 inches of water or 7 7/8 inches of lucite, intercepting the entire useful beam. 2. If the X -ray source is below the table, the X -ray exposure rate shall be measured with the nearest part of the imaging assembly located at 14 inches above the table top. 3. The eld size at the point of exposure rate measurement shall be at least 6 1/4 square inches in area in the plane perpendicular to the central ray. (B) Fluoroscopic equipment manufactured after August 1, 1974, and equipped with automatic exposure rate controls. Fluoroscopic equipment which is provided with automatic exposure rate control shall not be operable at any combination of tube potential and current which will result in an exposure rate in excess of 10 roentgens per minute at the point where the center of the useful beam enters the patient, except during recording of fluoroscopicimages, or when an optional high level control is provided. When so provided, the equipment shall not be operable at any combination of tube potential and current which will result in an exposure rate in excess of 5 roentgens per minute at the point where the center of the useful beam enters the patient unless the high level control is activated. Special means of activation of high level controls shall be required. The high level control shall only be operable when continuous manual activation is provided by the operator. A continuous signal audible to the fluoroscopist s hall indicate that the high level control is being employed. (C) Fluoroscopic equipment manufactured after August 1, 1974, without automatic exposure rate controls. Fluoroscopic equipment which is not provided with automatic exposure rate control shall not be operable at any combination of tube potential and current which will result in an exposure rate in excess of 5 roentgens per minute at th e point where the center of the useful beam enters the patient, except during recording of fluoroscopic images, or when an optional high level control is activated. Special means of activation of high level controls shall be required. The high level control shall only be operable when continuous manual activation is provided by the operator. A continuous signal audible to the fluoroscopist shall indicate that the high level control is being employed. (D) Measuring useful beam exposure rate compliance. 1. If the X -ray tube is below the table, the exposure rate shall be measured 1 centimeter above the tabletop or cradle. 2. If the X -ray tube is above the table, the exposure rate shall be measured at 30 centimeters above the tabletop with the end of the beam -limiting devic e or spacer positioned as closely as possible to the point of measurement. 3. In a C-arm type of fluoroscope, the exposure rate shall be measured at 30 centimeters from the input surface of the fluoroscopic imaging assembly. (8) Mobile fluoroscopic equipment shall meet the requirements of this section where applicable, except that: (A) Inherent provisions shall be made so that the machine is not operated at a source -skin distance of less than 30 cm (12 inches). (B) Image intensication shall always be provided. Conventional fluoroscopic screens shall not be used. (C) It shall be impossible to operate a machine when the collimating cone or diaphragm is not in place. (D) It shall be impossible to energize the useful beam of a mobile fluoroscope unless the entire useful beam is intercepted by the image receptor. (9) Devices which indicate the X -ray tube potential and current shall be provided, and should be located in such a manner that the operator may monitor the tube potential and current during fluoroscopy. (10) A shielding device of at least 0.25 millimeters lead equivalent shall be provided for covering the bucky -slot during fluoroscopy. (11) Whenever practicable, protective drapes, or hinged or sliding panels, of at least 0.25 millimeters lead equivalent shall be provided between the patient and 156 CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS \u00a7 30308.1 the fluoroscopist to intercept scattered radiation which would otherwise reach the fluoroscopist and others near the machine. Such devices shall not substitute for wearing of a protective apron. (b) The user shall ensure the following: (1) Protective aprons of at least 0.25 mm lead equivalent shall be worn in the fluoroscopy room by each person, except the patient, whose body is likely to be exposed to 5 mR/hr or more. (2) On fluoroscopes with automatic exposur e controls the operator shall monitor the tube current and potential at least once each week to ascertain that they are in their usual ranges for a given set of operating parameters. This requirement may be met by adjusting the controls to usual settings f or fluoroscoping an average patient, and using a phantom of any suitable material with attenuation roughly equivalent to six to ten inches of water. Whenever the monitored tube current or potential vary in a way which could increase the patient X-ray exposu re rate by more than 25% over the latest exposure rate measurement required by subsection (b)(3), the cause(s) for the change shall be determined promptly and the patient exposure rate shall be remeasured. On fluoroscopes with manual exposure control only, the operator shall monitor the tube current and potential at least once each day during use to ascertain that they are within the norma l ranges used by the facility. A written log shall be kept of all monitored readings and shall include at least the tube current and potential, the date, identication of the fluoroscope, and name of the person who did the monitoring. Records of all monitored readings shall be preserved at the facility for at least three years. (3) Measurements of the table top or patient exposure rate shall be made at least once each year for units with automa tic exposure control, and at least once each 3 years for units without automatic exposure control, and immediately following alteration or replacement of a major component, such as the X -ray tube, the exposure controls, the imaging assembly, and the power source. (4) On the cineradiography equipment, the exposure rates to which patients are normally subjected shall be determined at least once each year, and immediately following alterations or replacement of a major component, such as the X -ray tube, the exposu re controls, the imaging assembly, and the power source. (c) The user shall record for each patient the cumulative air kerma, if provided by the equipment, or, if it is not provided, the total fluoroscopic irradiation time. The terms \"cumulative air kerma\" and \"fluoroscopic irradiation time\" are as dened in title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1020.30(b) referenced in section 30305(a)(4). This record shall be maintained for three years and made available for inspection by the Department. The recorded value shall be trackable to the particular patient but need not be retained in the patient's medical record. NOTE: Authority cited: Sections 114975, 115000 1.

Consolidated lists of persons; License renewals; Review procedures; Report to Legislature; Rules and regulations; Forms; to Legislature; Rules and regulations; Forms; of information; Suspension or revocation of driver's license; Severability (a) As used in this section: (1) \"Applicant\" means a person applying for issuance or renewal of a license. (2) \"Board\" means an entity specied in Section 101 of the Business and Professions Code, the entities referred to in Sections 1000 and 3600 of the Business and Professions Code, the State Bar of California, the Department of Real Estate, the Department of Motor Vehicles, the Secretary of State, the Department of Fish and Wildlife, and any other state commission, department, committee, examiner, or agency that issues a license, certicate, credential, permit, registration, or any other autho - rization to engage in a business, occupation, or profession, or to the extent requ ired by federal law or regulations, for recreational purposes. This term includes all boards, commissions, departments, committees, examiners, entities, and agencies that issue a license, certicate, credential, permit, registration, or any other authoriza tion to engage in a business, occupation, or profession. The failure to specically name a particular board, commission, department, committee, examiner, entity, or agency that issues a license, certicate, credential, permit, registration, or any other au tho- rization to engage in a business, occupation, or profession does not exclude that board, commission, department, committee, examiner, entity, or agency from this term. (3) \"Certied list\" means a list provided by the local child support agency to the Department of Child Support Services in which the local child support agency veries, under penalty of perjury, that the names contained therein are support obligors found to be out of compliance with a judgment or order for support in a case being enforced under Title IV-D of the federal Social Security Act. 315 GENERAL LAWS FAMILY CODE (4) \"Compliance with a judgment or order for support\" means that, as set forth in a judgment or order for child or family support, the obligor is no more than 30 calendar days in arrears in making payments in full for current support, in making periodic payments in full, whether court ordered or by agreement with the local child support agency, on a support arrearage, or in making periodic payments in full, whether court ordered or by agreement with the local child support agency, on a judgment for reimbursement for public assistance, or has obtained a judicial nding that equitable estoppel as provided in statute or case law precludes enforcement of the order. The local child support agency is authorized to use this section to enforce orders for spousal support only when the local child support agency is also enforcing a related child support obligation owed to the obligee parent by the same obligor, pursuant to Sections 17400 and 17604. (5) \"License\" includes membership in the State Bar of California, a nd a certicate, credential, permit, registration, or any other authorization issued by a board that allows a person to engage in a business, occupation, or profession, or to operate a commercial motor vehicle, including appointment and commission by the Secretary of State as a notary public. \"License\" also includes any driver's license issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, any commercial shing license issued by the Depart - ment of Fish and Wildlife, and to the extent required by federal law or regulations, any license used for recreational purposes. This term includes all licenses, certicates, credentials, permits, registrations, or any other authorization issued by a board that allows a person to engage in a business, occupation, or profession. The failure to specically name a particular type of license, certicate, credential, permit, registra - tion, or other authorization issued by a board that allows a person to engage in a business, occupation, or profession, does not exclude that license, certicate, creden - tial, permit, registration, or other authorization from this term. (6) \"Licensee\" means a person holding a license, certicate, credential, permit, registration, or other authorization issued by a board, to engage in a business, occupation, or profession, or a commercial driver's license as dened in Section 15210 of the Vehicle Code, including an appointment and commission by the Secretary of State as a notary public. \"Licensee\" also means a person holding a driver's li cense issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles, a person holding a commercial shing license issued by the Department of Fish and Wildlife, and to the extent required by federal law or regulations, a person holding a license used for recreational purpose s.

For licenses issued to an entity that is not an individual person, \"licensee\" includes an individual who is either listed on the license or who qualies for the license. (b) The local child support agency shall maintain a list of those persons included in a case being enforced under Title IV -D of the federal Social Security Act against whom a support order or judgment has been rendered by, or registered in, a court of this state, and who are not in compliance with that order or judgment. The local child suppo rt agency shall submit a certied list with the names, social security numbers, individual taxpayer identication numbers, or other uniform identication numbers, and last known addresses of these persons and the name, address, and telephone number of the local child support agency who certied the list to the department. The local child support agency shall verify, under penalty of perjury, that the persons listed are subje ct to an order or judgment for the payment of support and that these persons are not in compliance with the order or judgment. The local child support agency shall submit to the department an updated certied list on a monthly basis. (c) The department shall c onsolidate the certied lists received from the local child support agencies and, within 30 calendar days of receipt, shall provide a copy of the 316 GENERAL LAWS FAMILY CODE consolidated list to each board that is responsible for the regulation of licenses, as specied in this section. (d) On or before November 1, 1992, or as soon thereafter as economically feasible, as determined by the department, all boards subject to this section shall implement procedures to accept and process the list provided by the department, in accordance with this section. Notwithstanding any other law, all boards shall collect social security numbers or individual taxpayer identication numbers from all applicants for the purposes of matching the names of the certied list provided by the department to applica nts and licensees and of responding to requests for this information made by child support agencies. (e)(1) Promptly after receiving the certied consolidated list from the department, and prior to the issuance or renewal of a license, each board shall determine whether the applicant is on the most recent certied consolidated list provided by the department. The board shall have the authority to withhold issuance or renewal of the license of an applicant on the list. (2) If an applicant is on the list, the board shall immediately serve notice as specied in subdivision (f) on the applicant of the board's intent to withhold issuance or renewal of the license. The notice shall be made per sonally or by mail to the applicant's last known mailing address on le with the board. Service by mail shall be complete in accordance with Section 1013 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (A) The board shall issue a temporary license valid for a period of 150 days to any applicant whose name is on the certied list if the applicant is otherwise eligible for a license. (B) Except as provided in subparagraph (D), the 150-day time period for a temporary license shall not be extended. Except as provided in subparagraph (D), only one temporary license shall be issued during a regular license term and it shall coincide with the rst 150 days of that license term. As this paragraph applies to commercial driver's licenses, \"license term\" shall be deemed to be 12 months from the date the application fee is received by the Department of Motor Vehicles. A license for the full or remainder of the license term shall be issued or renewed only upon compliance with this section. (C) In the event that a license or application for a license or the renewal of a license is denied pursuant to this section, any funds paid by the applicant or licensee shall not be refunded by the board. (D) This paragraph shall apply only in the case of a driver's license, other than a commercial driver's license. Upon the request of the local child support agency or by order of the court upon a showing of good cause, the board shall extend a 150 -day temporary license for a period not to exceed 150 extra days. (3)(A) The department may, when it is economically feasible for the department and the boards to do so as determined by the department, in cases where the department is aware that certain child support obligors listed on the certied lists have been out of compliance with a judgment or order for support for more than four months, provide a supplemental list of these obligors to each board with which the department has an interagency agreement to implement this paragraph. Upon request by the department, the licenses of these obligors shall be subject to suspension, provided that the licenses would not otherwise be eligible for renewal within six months fro m the date of the request by the department. The board shall have the authority to suspend the license of any licensee on this supplemental list. (B) If a licensee is on a supplemental list, the board shall immediately serve notice as specied in subdivision (f) on the licensee that the license will be automatically suspended 150 days after notice is served, unless compliance with this section is achieved. The notice shall be made personally or by mail to the licensee's last known mailing address on le with the board. Service by mail shall be complete in accordance with Section 1013 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (C) The 150-day notice period shall not be extended. 317 GENERAL LAWS FAMILY CODE (D) In the event that any license is suspended pursuant to this section, any funds paid by the licensee shall not be refunded by the board. (E) This paragraph shall not apply to licenses subject to annual renewal or annual fee. (f) Notices shall be developed by each board in accordance with guidelines provided by the department and subject to approval by the department. The notice shall include the address and telephone number of the local child support agency that submitted the name on the certied list, and shall emphasize the necessity of obtaining a release from that local child support agency as a condition for the issuance, renewal, or continued valid status of a license or licenses. (1) In the case of applicants not subject to parag raph (3) of subdivision (e), the notice shall inform the applicant that the board shall issue a temporary license, as provided in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e), for 150 calendar days if the applicant is otherwise eligible and that upon expiration of that time period the license will be denied unless the board has received a release from the local child suppo rt agency that submitted the name on the certied list. (2) In the case of licensees named on a supplemental list, the notice shall inform the licensee that the license will continue in its existing status for no more than 150 calendar days from the date of mailing or service of the notice and thereafter will be suspended indenitely unless, during the 150-day notice period, the board has receive d a release from the local child support agency that submitted the name on the certied list. Additionally, the notice shall inform the licensee that any license suspended under this section will remain so until the expiration of the remaining license term, unless the board receives a release along with applications and fees, if applicable, to reinstate the license during the license term. (3) The notice shall also inf orm the applicant or licensee that if an application is denied or a license is suspended pursuant to this section, any funds paid by the applicant or licensee shall not be refunded by the board. The Department of Child Support Services shall also develop a form that the applicant shall use to request a review by the local child support agency. A copy of this form shall be included with every notice sent pursuant to this subdivision. (g)(1) Each local child support agency shall maintain review procedures con sistent with this section to allow an applicant to have the underlying arrearage and any relevant defenses investigated, to provide an applicant information on the process of obtaining a modication of a support order, or to provide an applicant assistance in the establishment of a payment schedule on arrearages if the circumstances so warrant. (2) It is the intent of the Legislature that a court or local child support agency, when determining an appropriate payment schedule for arrearages, base its decision on the facts of the particular case and the priority of payment of child support over other debts. The payment schedule shall also recognize that certain expenses may be essential to enable an obligor to be employed. Therefore , in reaching its decision, the court or the local child support agency shall consider both of these goals in setting a payment schedule for arrearages. (h) If the applicant wishes to challenge the submission of their name on the certied list, the applicant shall make a timely written request for review to the local child support agency who certied the applicant's name. A request for review pursuant to this section shall be resolved in the same manner and timeframe provided for resolution of a complaint pursuant to Section 17800. The local child support agency shall immediately send a release to the appropriate board and the applicant, if any of the following conditions are met: (1) The applicant is found to be in compliance or negotiates an agreement with the local child support agency for a payment schedule on arrearages or reimbursement. (2) The applicant has submitted a request for review, but the local child support agency will be unable to complete the review and send notice of its ndings to the applicant within the time specied in Section 17800. 318 GENERAL LAWS FAMILY CODE (3) The applicant has led and served a request for judicial review pursuant to this section, but a resolution of that review will not be made within 150 days of the date of service of notice pursuant to subdivision (f). This paragraph applies only if the delay in completing the judicial review process is not the result of the applicant's failure to act in a reasonable, timely, and diligent manner upon receiving the local child support agency's notice of ndings. (4) The applicant has obtained a judicial nding of compliance as dened in this section. (i) An applicant is required to act with diligence in responding to notices from the board and the local child support agency with the recognition that the temporary license will lapse or the license suspension will go into effect after 150 days and that the l ocal child support agency and, where appropriate, the court must have time to act within that period. An applicant's delay in acting, without good cause, which directly results in the inability of the local child support agency to complete a review of the applicant's request or the court to hear the request for judicial review within the 150 -day pe riod shall not constitute the diligence required under this section which would justify the issuance of a release. (j) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the local child support agency shall not issue a release if the applicant is not in compliance with the judgment or order for support. The local child support agency shall notify the applicant, in writing, that the applicant may, by ling an order to show cause or notice of motion, request any or all of the following: (1) Judicial review of the local child support agency's decision not to issue a release. (2) A judicial determination of compliance. (3) A modication of the support judgment or order. The notice shall also contain the name and address of the court in which the applicant shall le the order to show cause or notice of motion and inform the applicant that their name shall remain on the certied list if the applicant does not timely request judicial review. The applicant shall comply with all statutes and rules of court regarding orders to show cause and notices of motion. This section does not limit an applicant from ling an order to show cause or notice of motion to modify a support judgment or order or to x a payment schedule on arrearages accruing under a support judgment or order or to obtain a court nding of compliance with a judgment or order for support. (k) The request for judicial review of the local child support agency's decision shall state the grounds for which review is requested and judicial review shall be limited to those stated grounds. The court shall hold an evidentiary hearing within 20 calendar days of the ling of the request for review. Judicial review of the local child support agency's decision shall be limited to a determination of each of the following issues: (1) Whether there is a support judgment, order, or payment schedule on arrearages or reimbursement. (2) Whether the petitioner is the obligor covered by the support judgment or order. (3) Whether the support obligor is or is not in compliance with the judgment or order of support. (4)(A) The extent to which the needs of the obligor, taking into account the obligor's payment history and the current circumstances of both the obligor and the obligee, warrant a conditional release as described in this subdivision. (B) The request for judicial review shall be served by the applicant upon the local child support agency that submitted the applicant's name on the certied list within seven calendar days of the ling of the petition. The court has the authority to uphold the action, unconditionally release the license, or conditionally release the license. (C) If the judicial review results in a nding by the court that the obligor is in compliance with the judgment or order for support, the local child support agency shall immediately send a release in accordance with subdivision (l) to the appropri - 319 GENERAL LAWS FAMILY CODE ate board and the applicant. If the judicial review results in a nding by the court that the needs of the obligor warrant a conditional release, the court shall make ndings of fact stating the basis for the release and the payment necessary to satisfy the unrestricted issuance or renewal of the license without prejudice to a later judicial determination of the amount of support arrearages, including interest, and shall specify payment terms, compliance with which are necessary to allow the release to remain in effect. (l)(1) The department shall prescribe release forms for use by local child support agencies. When the obligor is in compliance, the local child support agency shall mail to the applicant and the appropriate board a release stating that th e applicant is in compliance. The receipt of a release shall serve to notify the applicant and the board that, for the purposes of this section, the applicant is in compliance with the judgment or order for support. A board that has received a release from the local child support agency pursuant to this subdivision shall process the release within ve business days of its receipt. (2) When the local child support agency determines, subsequent to the issuance of a release, that the applicant is once again not in compliance with a judgment or order for support, or with the terms of repayment as described in this subdivision, the local child support agency may notify the board, the obligor, and the department in a format prescribed by the department that the obligor is not in compliance. (3) The department may, when it is economically feasible for the department and the boards to develop an automated process for complying with this subdivision, notify the boards in a manner prescribed by the department, that the obligor is once again not in co mpliance. Upon receipt of this notice, the board shall immediately notify the obligor on a form prescribed by the department that the obligor's license will be suspended on a specic date, and this date shall be no longer than 30 days from the date the form is mailed. The obligor shall be further notied that the license will remain suspended until a new release is issued in accordance with subdivision (h). This section does not limit the obligor from seeking judicial review of suspension pursuant to the procedures described in subdivision (k). (m) The department may enter into interagency agreements with the state agencies that have responsibility for the administration of boards necessary to implement this section, to the extent that it is cost effective to implement this section. These agreements shall provide for the receipt by the other state agencies and boards of federal funds to cover that portion of costs allo wable in federal law and regulation and incurred by the state agencies and boards in implementing this section. Notwithstanding any other law, revenue generated by a board or state agency shall be used to fund the nonfederal share of costs incurred pursuant to this section. These agreements shall provide that boards shall reimburse the department for the nonfederal share of costs incurred by the department in implementing this section. The boards shall reimburse the department for the nonfederal share of costs incurred pursuant to this section from moneys collected from applicants and licensees. (n) Notwithstanding any other law, in order for the boards subject to this section to be reimbursed for the costs incurred in administering its provisions, the boards may, with the approval of the appropriate department director, levy on all licensees and applicants a surcharge on any fee or fees collected pursuant to law, or, alternatively, with the approval of the appropriate department director, levy on the applicants or licensees named on a certied list or supplemental list, a special fee. (o) The process described in subdivision (h) shall constitute the sole administrative remedy for contesting the issuance of a temporary license or the denial or suspension of a license under this section. The procedures specied in the administrative adjudication provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 11400) and Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 11500) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code) shall not apply to the denial, suspension, or failure to issue or renew a license or the issuance of a temporary license pursuant to this section. 320 GENERAL LAWS FAMILY CODE (p) In furtherance of the public policy of increasing child support enforcement and collections, on or before November 1, 1995, the State Department of Social Services shall make a report to the Legislature and the Governor based on data collected by the boards and the district attorneys in a format prescribed by the State Department of Social Services.

The seizing agency may authorize its own officer or employee to conduct the hearing if the hearing officer is not the same person who requests the seizure or impoundment of the animal and is not junior in rank to that person. The agency may use the services of a hearing officer from outside the agency for the purposes of complying with this section.

A veterinarian may humanely euthanize an impounded animal without regard to the prescribed holding period when it has been determined that the animal has incurred severe injuries or is incurably crippled. A veterinarian also may imme diately humanely euthanize an impounded animal afflicted with a serious conta - gious disease unless the owner or the owner's agent immediately authorizes treatment of the animal by a veterinarian at the expense of the owner or agent. (j) No animal properly seized under this section or pursuant to a search warrant shall be returned to its owner until the owner can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the seizing agency or hearing officer that the owner can and will provide the necessary care for the animal.

If the court nds that the petitioner has met its burden, the court shall order the immediate forfeiture of the animal as sought by the petition. (4) Nothing in this subdivision is intended to authorize a seizing agency or prosecuting attorney to le a petition to determine an owner's ability to legally retain an animal pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (l) if a petition has previously been led pursuant to this subdivision. (l)(1) Upon the conviction of a person char ged with a violation of this section, or Section 597 or 597a, all animals lawfully seized and impounded with respect to the violation shall be adjudged by the court to be forfeited and shall thereupon be transferred to the impounding officer or appropriate public entity for proper adoption or other disposition.

In the event of the acquittal or nal discharge without conviction of the person charged, if the animal is still impounded, the animal has not been previously deemed abandoned pursuant to subdivision (h), the court has not ordere d that the animal be forfeited pursuant to subdivision (k), the court shall, on demand, direct the release of seized or impounded animals to the defendant upon a showing of proof of ownership. (3) Any questions regarding ownership shall be determined in a separate hearing by the court where the criminal case was nally adjudicated and the court shall hear testimony from any persons who may assist the court in determining ownership of the animal. If the owner is determined to be unknown or the owner is prohibited or unable to retain possession of the animals for any reason, the court shall order the animals to be released to the appropriate public entity for adoption or other lawful disposition. This section is not intended to cause the release of any animal, bird, reptile, amphibian, or sh seized or impounded pursuant to any other statute, ordinance, or munici pal regulation. This section shall not prohibit the seizure or impoundment of animals as evidence as provided for under any other provision of law. (m) It shall be the duty of all peace officers, humane society officers, and animal control officers to use all currently acceptable methods of identication, both electronic and otherwise, to determine the lawful owner or caretaker of any seized or impounded animal. It shall also be their duty to make reasonable efforts to notify the owner or caretaker of the w hereabouts of the animal and any procedures available for the lawful recovery of the animal and, upon the owner's and caretaker's initiation of recovery procedures, retain custody of the animal for a reasonable period of time to allow for completion of the recovery process. Efforts to locate or contact the owner or caretaker and communications with persons claiming to be the owner or caretaker shall be rec orded and maintained and be made available for public inspection.

HISTORY: Added Stats 2021 ch 257 \u00a7 28.5 (AB 177), effective September 23, 2021, operative January 1, 2022. Amended Stats 2022 ch 734 4 (SB 1106), \u00a7 1210.1. Possession of Controlled Substances; Probation; Exceptions (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except as provided in subdivision (b), any person convicted of a nonviolent drug possession offense shall receive probation. 395 GENERAL LAWS PENAL CODE As a condition of probation the court shall require participation in and completion of an appropriate drug treatment program. The court shall impose appropriate drug testing as a condition of probation. The court may also impose, as a condition of probatio n, participation in vocational training, family counseling, literacy training and/or commu - nity service. A court may not impose incarceration as an additional condition of probation. Aside from the limitations imposed in this subdivision, the trial court is not otherwise limited in the type of probation conditions it may impose. Probation shall be imposed by suspending the imposition of sentence. No person shall be denied th e opportunity to benet from the provisions of the Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000 based solely upon evidence of a co -occurring psychiatric or developmental disorder. To the greatest extent possible, any person who is convicted of, and pla ced on probation pursuant to this section for a nonviolent drug possession offense shall be monitored by the court through the use of a dedicated court calendar and the incorporation of a collaborative court model of oversight that includes close collaboration with treatment providers and probation, drug testing commensurate with treatment needs, and supervision of progress through review hearings. In addition to any ne assessed under other provisions of law, the trial judge may require any person convicted of a nonviolent drug possession offense who is reasonably able to do so to contribute to the cost of his or her own placement in a drug treatment program. (b) Subdivision (a) shall not apply to any of the following: (1) Any defendant who previously has been convicted of one or more violent or serious felonies as dened in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7, respectively, unless the nonviolent drug possession offense occurred after a period of ve years in which the defendant remained free of both prison custody and the commission of an offense that results in a felony conviction other than a nonviolent drug possession offense, or a misdemeanor conviction involving physical injury or the threat of physical injury to another person. (2) Any defendant who, in addition to one or more nonviolent drug possession offenses, has been convicted in the same proceeding of a misdemeanor not related to the use of drugs or any felony. (3) Any defendant who, while armed with a deadly weapon, with the intent to use the same as a deadly weapon, unlawfully possesses or is under the influence of any controlled substance identied in Section 11054, 11055, 11056, 11057, or 11058 of the Health and Safety Code. (4) Any defendant who refuses drug treatment as a condition of probation. (5) Any defendant who has two separate convictions for nonviolent drug possession offenses, has participated in two separate courses of drug treatment pursuant to subdivision (a), and is found by the court, by clear and convincing evidence, to be unamenable to any and all forms of available drug treatment, as dened in subdivision (b) of Section 1210. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the trial court shall sentence that defendant to 30 days in jail. (c)(1) Any defendant who has previously been convicted of at least three non -drug - related felonies for which the defendant has served three separate prison terms within the meaning of subdivision (b) of Section 667.5 shall be presumed eligible for treatme nt under subdivision (a). The court may exclude the defendant from treatment under subdivision (a) where the court, pursuant to the motion of the prosecutor or its own motion, nds that the defendant poses a present danger to the safety of others and would not benet from a drug treatment program. The court shall, on the record, state its ndings, the reasons for those ndings. (2) Any defendant who has previously been convicted of a misdemeanor or felony at least ve times within the prior 30 months shall be presumed to be eligible for treatment under subdivision (a). The court may exclude the defendant from treatment under subdivision (a) if the court, pursuant to the motion of the prosecutor, or on its own motion, nds that the defendant poses a present danger to the safety of others or 396 GENERAL LAWS PENAL CODE would not benet from a drug treatment program. The court shall, on the record, state its ndings and the reasons for those ndings. (d) Within seven days of an order imposing probation under subdivision (a), the probation department shall notify the drug treatment provider designated to provide drug treatment under subdivision (a). Within 30 days of receiving that notice, the treatment provider shall prepare a treatment plan and forward it to the probation department for distribution to the court and counsel. The treatment provider shall provide to the probation department standardized treatment progress reports, with minimum data elements as determined by the department, including all drug testing results. At a minimum, the reports shall be provided to the court every 90 days, or more frequently, as the court directs. (1) If at any point during the course of drug treatment the treatment provider noties the probation department and the court that the defendant is unamenable to the drug treatment being provided, but may be amenable to other drug treatments or related program s, the probation department may move the court to modify the terms of probation, or on its own motion, the court may modify the terms of probation after a hearing to ensure that the defendant receives the alternative drug treatment or program. (2) If at any po int during the course of drug treatment the treatment provider noties the probation department and the court that the defendant is unamenable to the drug treatment provided and all other forms of drug treatment programs pursuant to subdivision (b) of Sect ion 1210, the probation department may move to revoke probation. At the revocation hearing, if it is proved that the defendant is unamenable to all drug treatment programs pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 1210, the court may revoke probation. (3) Drug treatment services provided by subdivision (a) as a required condition of probation may not exceed 12 months, unless the court makes a nding supported by the record, that the continuation of treatment services beyond 12 months is necessary for drug treatment to be successful. If that nding is made, the court may order up to two six -month extensions of treatment services. The provision of treatment services under the Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000 shall not exceed 24 months . (e)(1) At any time after completion of drug treatment and the terms of probation, the court shall conduct a hearing, and if the court nds that the defendant successfully completed drug treatment, and substantially complied with the conditions of proba - tion, including refraining from the use of drugs after the completion of treatment, the conviction on which the probation was based shall be set aside and the court shall dismiss the indictment, complaint, or information against the defendant. In addition, except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), both the arrest and the conviction shall be deemed never to have occurred. The defendant may additionally petition the court for a dismissal of charges at any time after completion of the prescribed course of drug treatment. Except as provided in paragraph (2) or (3), the defendant shall thereafter be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense of which he or she has been convicted. (2) Dismissal of an indictment, complaint, or information pursuant to paragraph (1) does not permit a person to own, possess, or have in his or her custody or control any rearm capable of being concealed upon the person or prevent his or her conviction under Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 29800) of Division 9 of Title 4 of Part 6. (3) Except as provided below, after an indictment, complaint, or information is dismissed pursuant to paragraph (1), the defendant may indicate in response to any question concerning his or her prior criminal record that he or she was not arrested or convicted for the offense. Except as provided below, a record pertaining to an arrest or conviction resulting in successful completion of a drug treatment program under this section may not, without the defendant's consent, be used in any way that could result in the denial of any employment, benet, license, or certicate. 397 GENERAL LAWS PENAL CODE Regardless of his or her successful completion of drug treatment, the arrest and conviction on which the probation was based may be recorded by the Department of Justice and disclosed in response to any peace officer application request or any law enforcem ent inquiry. Dismissal of an information, complaint, or indictment under this section does not relieve a defendant of the obligation to disclose the arrest and conviction in response to any direct question contained in any questionnaire or application for public office, for a position as a peace officer as dened in Section 830, for licensure by any state or local agency, for contracting with the California State Lottery, or for purposes of serving on a jury. (f)(1) If probation is revoked pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the defendant may be incarcerated pursuant to otherwise applicable law without regard to the provisions of this section. The court may modify or revoke probation if the alleged violation is proved. (2) If a defendant receives probation under subdivision (a), and violates that probation either by committing an offense that is not a nonviolent drug possession offense, or by violating a non-drug -related condition of probation, and the state moves to revoke probation, the court may remand the defendant for a period not exceeding 30 days during which time the court may receive input from treatment, probation, the state, and the defendant, and the court may conduct further hearings as it deems appropriate to determine whether or not probation should be reinstated under this section. If the court reinstates the defendant on probation, the court may modify the treatment plan and any other terms of probation, and continue the defendant in a treatment program under the Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000. If the court reinstate s the defendant on probation, the court may, after receiving input from the treatment provider and probation, if available, intensify or alter the treatment plan under subdivision (a), and impose sanctions, including jail sanctions not exceeding 30 days, a tool to enhance treatment compliance. (3)(A) If a defendant receives probation under subdivision (a), and violates that probation either by committing a nonviolent drug possession offense, or a misde - meanor for simple possession or use of drugs or drug paraphernalia, being present where drugs are used, or failure to register as a drug offender, or any activity similar to those listed in subdivision (d) of Section 1210, or by violating a drug -related condition of probation, and the state moves to revoke probation, the court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether probation shall be revoked. The trial court shall revoke probation if the alleged probation violation is proved and the state proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant poses a danger to the safety of others. If the court does not revoke probation, it may intensify or alter the drug treatment plan and in addition, if the violation does not involve the recent use of drugs as a circumstance of the violation, including, but not limited to, violations relating to failure to appear at treatment or court, noncompliance with treatment, and failure to report for drug testing, the court may impose sanctions including jail sanctions that may not exceed 48 hours of continuous custody as a tool to enhance treatment compliance and impose other changes in the terms and conditions of probation. The court shall consider, among other factors, the seriousness of the violation, previous treatment compliance, employment, education, vocational train - ing, medical conditions, medical treatment, including narcotics replacement treat- ment, and including the opinion of the defendant's licensed and treating physician if immediately available and presented at the hearing, child support obligations, and family responsibilities. The court shall consider additional conditions of probation, which may include, but are not limited to, community service and supervised work programs. If one of the circumstances of the violation involves recent drug use, as well as other circumstances of violation, and the circumstance of recent drug use is demonstrated to the court by satisfactory evidence and a nding made on the record, the court may, after receiving input from treatment and probation, if available, direct the defendant to enter a licensed detoxication or 398 GENERAL LAWS PENAL CODE residential treatment facility, and if there is no bed immediately available in that type of facility, the court may order that the defendant be conned in a county jail for detoxication purposes only, if the jail offers detoxication services, for a peri od not to exceed 10 days. The detoxication services must provide narcotic replacement therapy for those defendants presently actually receiving narcotic replacement therapy. (B) If a defendant receives probation under subdivision (a), and for the second time violates that probation either by committing a nonviolent drug possession offense, or a misdemeanor for simple possession or use of drugs or drug parapher - nalia, being presen t where drugs are used, or failure to register as a drug offender, or any activity similar to those listed in subdivision (d) of Section 1210, or by violating a drug -related condition of probation, and the state moves to revoke probation, the court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether probation shall be revoked. The trial court shall revoke probation if the alleged probation violation is proved and the state proves by a preponderance of the evidence either that the defendant poses a danger to the safety of others or is unamenable to drug treatment. In determining whether a defendant is unamenable to drug treatment, the court may consider, to the extent relevant, whether the defendant (i) has committed a serious violation of rules at the drug treatment program, (ii) has repeatedly committed violations of program rules that inhibit the defendant's ability to function in the program, or (iii) has continually refused to participate in the program or asked to be removed from the program. If the court does not revoke probation, it may intensify or alter the drug treatment plan, and may, in addition, if the violation does not involve the recent use of drugs as a circumstance of the violation, including, but not limited to, violations relating to failure to appear at treatment or court, noncompliance with treatment, and failure to report for drug testing, impose sanctions including jail sanctions that may not exceed 120 hours of continuous custody as a tool to enhance treatment compliance and impose other changes in the terms and conditions of probation. The court shall consider, among other factors, the seriousness of the violation, previous treatment compliance, employment, educa - tion, vocational training, medical conditions, medical treatment, including narcotics replacement treatment, and including the opinion of the defendant's licensed and treating physician if immediately available and presented at the hearing, child support obligations, and family responsibilities. The court shall consider additional conditions of probation, which may include, but are not limited to, community service and supervise d work programs. If one of the circumstances of the violation involves recent drug use, as well as other circumstances of violation, and the circumstance of recent drug use is demonstrated to the court by satisfactory evidence and a nding made on the record, the court may, after receiving input from treatment and probation, if available, direct the defendant to enter a licensed detoxication or residential treatment facility, and if there is no bed immediately available in the facility, the court may o rder that th e def en dant be con ned in a county jail for detoxication purposes only, if the jail offers detoxication services, for a period not to exceed 10 days. Detoxication services must provide narcotic replacement therapy for those defendants presen tly actually receiving narcotic replacement therapy. (C) If a defendant receives probation under subdivision (a), and for the third or subsequent time violates that probation either by committing a nonviolent drug possession offense, or by violating a drug -related condition of probation, and the state moves for a third or subsequent time to revoke probation, the court shall conduct a hear ing to determine whether probation shall be revoked. If the alleged probation violation is proved, the defendant is not eligible for continued probation under subdivision (a) unless the court determines that the defendant is not a danger to the community and would benet from further treatment under subdivision (a). The court may then either intensify or alter the treatment plan under subdivision 399 GENERAL LAWS PENAL CODE (a) or transfer the defendant to a highly structured drug court. If the court continues the defendant in treatment under subdivision (a), or drug court, the court may impose appropriate sanctions including jail sanctions as the court deems appropri - ate. (D) If a defendant on probation at the effectiv e date of this act for a nonviolent drug possession offense violates that probation either by committing a nonviolent drug possession offense, or a misdemeanor for simple possession or use of drugs or drug paraphernalia, being present where drugs are used, or failure to register as a drug offender, or any activity similar to those listed in subdivision (d) of Section 1210, or by violating a drug -related condition of probation, and the state moves to revoke probation, the court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether probation shall be revoked. The trial court shall revoke probation if the alleged probation violation is proved and the state proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant poses a danger to the safety of others. If the court does not revoke probation, it may modify or alter the treatment plan, and in addition, if the violation does not involve the recent use of drugs as a circumstance of the violation, including, but not limited to, violations relating to failure to appear at treatment or court, noncompliance with treatment, and failure to report for drug testing, the court may impose sanctions including jail sanctions that may not exceed 48 hours of continuous custody as a tool to enhance treatment compliance and impose other changes in the terms and conditions of probation. The court shall consider, among other factors, the seriousness of the violation, previous treatment compliance, employment, educa - tion, vocational training, medical conditions, medical treatment, including narcotics replacement treatment, and including the opinion of the defendant's licensed and treating physician if immediately available and presented at the hearing, child support obligations, and family responsibilities. The court shall consider additional condition s of probation, which may include, but are not limited to, community service and supervised work programs. If one of the circumstances of the violation involves recent drug use, as well as other circumstances of violation, and the circumstance of recent drug use is demonstrated to the court by satisfactory evidence and a nding made on the record, the court may, after receiving input from treatment and probation, if available, direct the defendant to enter a licensed detoxication or residential treatment f acility, and if there is no bed immediately available in that type of facility, the court may order that the defendant be conned in a county jail for detoxication purposes only, if the jail offers detoxication services, for a period not to exceed 10 days. The detoxication services must provide narcotic replacement therapy for those defendants presently actually receiving narcotic replacement therapy. (E) If a defendant on probation at the effective date of this act for a nonviolent drug possession offense violates that probation a second time either by committing a nonviolent drug possession offense, or a misdemeanor for simple possession or use of drugs or drug paraphernalia, being present where drugs are used, or failure to register as a drug offender, or any activity similar to those listed in subdivision (d) of Section 1210, or by violating a drug -related condition of probati on, and the state moves for a second time to revoke probation, the court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether probation shall be revoked. The trial court shall revoke proba - tion if the alleged probation violation is proved and the state proves by a prepon - derance of the evidence either that the defendant poses a danger to the safety of others or that the defendant is unamenable to drug treatment. If the court does not revoke probation, it may modify or alter the treatment plan, and in addition, if the violation does not involve the recent use of drugs as a circumstance of the violation, including, but not limited to, violations relating to failure to appear at treatment or court, noncompliance with treatment, and failure to report for drug testing, the court may impose sanctions including jail sanctions that may not exceed 120 hours of continuous custody as a tool to enhance treatment compliance and impose other 400 GENERAL LAWS PENAL CODE changes in the terms and conditions of probation. The court shall consider, among other factors, the seriousness of the violation, previous treatment compliance, employment, education, vocational training, medical c onditions, medical treatment including narcotics replacement treatment, and including the opinion of the defen- dant's licensed and treating physician if immediately available and presented at the hearing, child support obligations, and family responsibilities. The court shall consider additional conditions of probation, which may include, but are not limited to, community service and supervised work programs. If one of the circumstances of the violation involves recent drug use, as well as othe r circumstances of violation, and the circumstance of recent drug use is demonstrated to the court by satisfactory evidence and a nding made on the record, the court may, after receiving input from treatment and probation, if available, direct the defendant to enter a licensed detoxication or residential treatment facility, and if there is no bed immediately available in that type of facility, the court may order that the defendant be conned in a c ounty jail for detoxication purposes only, if the jail offers detoxication services, for a period not to exceed 10 days. The detoxication services must provide narcotic replacement therapy for those defendants presently actually receiving narcotic replacement therapy. (F) If a defendant on probation at the effective date of this act for a nonviolent drug offense violates that probation a third or subsequent time either by committing a nonviolent drug possession offense, or by violating a drug -related condition of probation, and the state moves for a third or subsequent time to revoke probation, the court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether probation shall be revoked. If the alleged probation violation is proved, the defendant is not eligible for continued probation under subdivision (a), unless the court determines that the defendant is not a danger to the community and would benet from further treatment under subdivision (a). The court may then either intensify or alter the treatment plan under subdivision (a) or transfer the defendant to a highly struc - tured drug court. If the court continues the defendant in treatment under subdivi - sion (a), or drug court, the court may impose appropriate sanctions including jail sanctions. (g) The term \"drug -related condition of probation\" shall include a probationer's specic drug treatment regimen, employment, vocational training, educational pro - grams, psych ological counseling, and family counseling.

For the purposes of this denition, low-level radioactive waste means radioactive waste not classied as high -level radioactive waste, transuranic waste, spent nuclear fuel, or byproduct material as dened in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of the denition of Byproduct material set forth in this section. Week means 7 consecutive days starting on Sunday. Weighting factor wT, for an organ or tissue (T) is the proportion of the risk of stochastic effects resulting from irradiation of that organ or tissue to the total risk of stochastic effects when the whole body is irradiated uniformly. For calculating the effective dose equivalent, the values of wT are: ORGAN DOSE WEIGHTING FACTORS Organ or tissue WT Gonads 0.25 Breast 0.15 Red bone marrow 0.12 Lung 0.12 Thyroid 0.03 Bone surfaces 0.03 Remainder 0.301 Whole Body 1.002 Whole body means, for purposes of external exposure, head, trunk (including male gonads), arms above the elbow, or legs above the knee. Working level (WL) is any combination of short -lived radon daughters - -212, bismuth -212, and polonium -212) in 1 liter of air that will result in the ultimate emission of 1.3 X 105 MeV of potential alpha particle energy. Working level month (WLM) means an exposure to 1 working level for 170 hours (2,000 working hours per year/12 months per year=approximately 170 hours per month). Year means the period of time beginning in January used to determine compliance with the provisions of this part. The licensee may change the starting date of the year used to determine compliance by the licensee provided that the change is made at the beginning of the year and that no day is omitted or duplicated in consecutive years.

(a) Denitions. As used in this part, the units of radiation dose are: Gray (Gy) is the SI unit of absorbed dose. One gray is equal to an absorbed dose of 1 Joule/kilogram (100 rads). Rad is the special unit of absorbed dose. One rad is equal to an absorbed dose of 100 ergs/gram or 0.01 joule/kilogram (0.01 gray). Rem is the special unit of any of the quantities expressed as dose equivalent. The dose equivalent in rems is equal to the absorbed dose in rads multiplied by the quality factor (1 rem=0.01 sievert). Sievert is the SI unit of any of the quantities expressed as dose equivalent. The dose equivalent in sieverts is equal to the absorbed dose in grays multiplied by the quality factor (1 Sv=100 rems). (b) As used in this part, the quality factors for converting absorbed dose to dose equivalent are shown in table 1004(b).1.

(a) The licensee shall control the occupational dose to individual adults, except for planned special exposures under \u00a7 20.1206, to the following dose limits. (1) An annual limit, which is the more limiting of \u2014 (i) The total effective dose equivalent being equal to 5 rems (0.05 Sv); or (ii) The sum of the deep -dose equivalent and the committed dose equivalent to any individual organ or tissue other than the lens of the eye being equal to 50 rems (0.5 Sv). (2) The annual limits to the lens of the eye, to the skin of the whole body, and to the skin of the extremities, which are: (i) A lens dose equivalent of 15 rems (0.15 Sv), and (ii) A shallow -dose equivalent of 50 rem (0.5 Sv) to the skin of the whole body or to the skin of any extremity. (b) Doses received in excess of the annual limits, including doses received during accidents, emergencies, and planned special exposures, must be subtracted from the limits for planned special exposures that the individual may receive duri ng the current year (see \u00a7 20.1206(e)(1)) and during the individual's lifetime (see \u00a7 20.1206(e)(2)). (c) When the external exposure is determined by measurement with an external personal monitoring device, the deep- dose equivalent must be used in place of the effective dose equivalent, unless the effective dose equivalent is determined by a dosimetry method approved by the NRC. The assigned deep -dose equivalent must be for the part of the body receiving the highest exposure. The assigned shallow -dose equivalent must be the dose averaged over the contiguous 10 square centimeters of skin receiving the highest exposure. The deep -dose equivalent, lens -dose equivalent, and shallow -dose equivalent may be assessed from surveys or other radiation measurements for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with the occupational dose limits, if the individual monitoring device was not in the region of highest potential exposure, or the results of individual monitoring are unavailable. (d) Derived air concentration (DAC) and annual limit on intake (ALI) values are presented in table 1 of Appendix B to Part 20 and may be used to determine the individual's dose (see \u00a7 20.2106) and to demonstrate compliance with the occupational dose limits. (e) In addition to the annual dose limits, the licensee shall limit the soluble uranium intake by an individual to 10 milligrams in a week in consideration of chemical toxicity (see footnote 3 of Appendix B to Part 20). (f) The licensee shall reduce the dose that an individual may be allowed to receive in the current year by the a mount of occupational dose received while employed by any other person (see \u00a7 20.2104(e)).

(a) If the licensee is required to monitor under both \u00a7\u00a7 20.1502(a) and (b), the licensee shall demonstrate compliance with the dose limits by summing external and internal doses. If the licensee is required to monitor only under \u00a7 20.1502(a) or only under \u00a7 20.1502(b), then summation is not required to demonstrate compliance with the dose limits. The licensee may demonstrate compliance with the requirements for summation of external and internal doses by meeting one of the conditions specied in paragraph (b) of this section and the conditions in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. (NOTE: The dose equivalents for the lens of the eye, the skin, and the extremities are not 419 GENERAL LAWS \u00a7 20.1203 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS included in the summation, but are subject to separate limits.) (b) Intake by inhalation. If the only intake of radionuclides is by inhalation, the total effective dose equivalent limit is not exceeded if the sum of the deep- dose equivalent divided by the total effective dose equivalent limit, and one of the following, does not exceed unity: (1) The sum of the fractions of the inhalation ALI for each radionucli de, or (2) The total number of derived air concentration -hours (DAC- hours) for all radionuclides divided by 2,000, or (3) The sum of the calculated committed effective dose equivalents to all signicantly irradiated1 organs or tissues (T) calculated from bioassay data using appropriate biological models and expressed as a fraction of the annual limit. (c) Intake by oral ingestion. If the occupationally exposed individual also receives an intake of radionuclides by oral ingestion greater than 10 percent of the applicable oral ALI, the licensee shall account for this intake and include it in demonstrating compliance with the limits. (d) Intake through wounds or absorption through skin. The licen see shall evaluate and, to the extent practical, account for intakes through wounds or skin absorption. Note: The intake through intact skin has been included in the calculation of DAC for hydrogen -3 and does not need to be further evaluated.

Licensees shall, when determining the dose from airborne radioactive material, include the contribution to the deep -dose equivalent, lens dose equivalent, and shallow - dose equivalent from external exposure to the radioactive cloud (see appendix B to part 20, footnotes 1 and 2). Note: Airborne radioactivity measurements and DAC values should not be used as the primary means to assess the deep -dose equivalent when the airborne radioactive material includes radionuclides other than noble gases or if the cloud of airborne radioactive material is not relatively uniform. The determination of the deep -dose equivalent to an individual should be based upon measurements using instruments or individual monitoring devices.

(a) For purposes of assessing dose used to determine compliance with occupational dose equivalent limits, the licensee shall, when required under \u00a7 20.1502, take suitable and timely measurements of \u2014 (1) Concentrations of radioactive materials in air in work areas; or (2) Quantities of radionuclides in the body; or (3) Quantities of radionuclides e xcreted from the body; or (4) Combinations of these measurements. (b) Unless respiratory protective equipment is used, as provided in \u00a7 20.1703, or the assessment of intake is based on bioassays, the licensee shall assume that an individual inhales radioactive mat erial at the airborne concentration in which the individual is present. (c) When specic information on the physical and biochemical properties of the 1 An organ or tissue is deemed to be significantly irradiated if, for that organ or tissue, the product of the weighting factor, wT, and the committed dose equivalent, HT,50, per unit intake is greater than 10 percent of the maximum weighted value of HT,50, (i.e., WT HT,50) per unit intake for any organ or tissue. 420 GENERAL LAWS CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS \u00a7 20.1206 radionuclides taken into the body or the behavior or the material in an individual is known, the licensee may \u2014 (1) Use that information to calculate the committed effective dose equivalent, and, if used, the licensee shall document that information in the individual's record; and (2) Upon prior approval of the Commission, adjust the DAC or ALI values to reflect the actual physical and chemical characteristics of airborne radioactive material (e.g., aeroso l size distribution or density); and (3) Separately assess the contribution of fractional intakes of Class D, W, or Y compounds of a given radionuclide (see Appendix B to Part 20) to the committed effective dose equivalent. (d) If the licensee chooses to assess intakes of Class Y material using the measurements given in \u00a7 20.1204(a)(2) or (3), the licensee may delay the recording and reporting of the assessments for periods up to 7 months, unless otherwise required by \u00a7\u00a7 20.2202 or 20.2203, in order to permit the licensee to make additional measurements basic to the assessments. (e) If the identity and concentration of each radionuclide in a mixture are known, the fraction of the DAC applicable to the mixture for use in calculating DAC -hours must be either \u2014 (1) The sum of the ratios of the concentration to the appropriate DAC value (e.g., D, W, Y) from Appendix B to Part 20 for each radio -nuclide in the mixture; or (2) The ratio of the total concentration for all radionuclides in the mixture to the most restrictive DAC value for any radionuclide in the mixture. (f) If the identity of each radionuclide in a mixture is known, but the concentra tion of one or more of the radionuclides in the mixture is not known, the DAC for the mixture must be the most restrictive DAC of any radionuclide in the mixture. (g) When a mixture of radionuclides in air exists, licensees may disregard certain radionuclides in the mixture if \u2014 (1) The licensee uses the total activity of the mixture in demonstrating compliance with the dose limits in \u00a7 20.1201 and in complying with the monitoring requirements in \u00a7 20.1502(b), and (2) The concentration of any radionuclide disregarded is less than 10 percent of its DAC, and (3) The sum of these percentages for all of the radionuclides disregarded in the mixture does not exceed 30 percent. (h)(1) In order to calculate the committed effective dose equivalent, the licensee may assume that the inhalation of one ALI, or an exposure of 2,000 DAC -hours, results in a committed effective dose equivalent of 5 rems (0.05 Sv) for radionuclides that have their ALIs or DACs based on the committed effective dose equivalent. (2) When the ALI (and the associated DAC) is determined by the nonstochastic organ dose limit of 50 rems (0.5 Sv), the intake of radionuclides that would result in a committed effective dose equivalent of 5 rems (0.05 Sv) (the stochastic ALI) is listed in parentheses in table 1 of Appendix B to Part 20. In this case, the licensee may, as a simplifying assumption, use the stochastic ALIs to determine committed effective dose equivalent. However, if the licensee uses the stochastic ALIs, the licensee must also demonstrate that the limit in \u00a7 20.1201(a)(1)(ii) is met. HISTORY [56 FR 1995] \u00a7 20.1206 Planned special exposures.

(b) The licensee (and employer if the employer is not the licensee) specically 421 GENERAL LAWS \u00a7 20.1207 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS authorizes the planned special exposure, in writing, before the exposure occurs. (c) Before a planned special exposure, the licensee ensures that the individuals involved are \u2014 (1) Informed of the purpose of the planned operation; (2) Informed of the estimated doses and associated potential risks and specic radiation levels or other conditions that might be involved in performing the task; and (3) Instructed in the measures to be taken to keep the dose ALARA considering other risks that may be present. (d) Prior to permitting an individual to participate in a planned special exposure , the licensee ascertains prior doses as required by \u00a7 20.2104(b) during the lifetime of the individual for each individual involved. (e) Subject to \u00a7 20.1201(b), the licensee does not authorize a planned special exposure that would cause an individual to rece ive a dose from all planned special exposures and all doses in excess of the limits to exceed \u2014 (1) The numerical values of any of the dose limits in \u00a7 20.1201(a) in any year; and (2) Five times the annual dose limits in \u00a7 20.1201(a) during the individual's lifetime. (f) The licensee maintains records of the conduct of a planned special exposure in accordance with \u00a7 20.2105 and submits a written report in accordance with \u00a7 20.2204. (g) The licensee records the best estimate of the dose resulting from the planned special exposure in the individual's record and informs the individual, in writing, of the dose within 30 days from the date of the planned special exposure. The dose from planne d special exposures is not to be considered in controlling future occupational dose of the individual under \u00a7 20.1201(a) but is to be included in evaluations required by \u00a7 20.1206 (d) and (e).

These guidelines are published in regulations for the public and the profession so that the processes used by the Board to impose discipline are readily available and transparent. The Board recognizes that each case is unique and that mitigating or aggravating circumstances in a particular case may necessitate variations. Therefore, the Board has developed minimum and maximum penalties to assist in determining the appropriate level of discipline. If an administrative law judge nds that a violation occurred but assesses less than the minimum penalty for that violation, the Board requests that the administrative law judge fully explain the reasons and the circumstances for the deviation. In addition, probationary conditions are divided into two categories,1) standard terms and conditions that are used for all cases, and 2) optional terms and conditions that are used for specic violations and circumstances unique to a specic case. The Board grants licenses to veterinarians, grants registrations to veterinary premises and veterinary technicians, and issues veterinary assistant controlled substance permits. If there is action taken against both the individual licensee and the premises registration, then the disciplinary order should reflect actions against each. However, in some cases, minimum standard violations are so severe that it is necessary to take immediate action and suspend the license of a facility. In these instances, the veterinary license and the premises registrat ion may be disciplined separately, and the disciplinary order should reflect the separate action. Because of the severity of cases resulting in actions taken by the Ofce of the Attorney General, the Board has established that the minimum penalty shall always include revocation or suspension with the revocation or suspension stayed and terms and conditions of probation imposed. The threat of the revocation or suspension being reinstated helps to ensure compliance with the probationary terms and conditions. The Board recommends that for alcohol or drug abuse related violations, the minimum term of probation should be ve years, and in addition, the mandatory terms and conditions listed specically for this type of case shall be imposed. A respondent may be represented by private counsel during enforcement proceedings, up to entry of a nal disciplinary order. Following entry of the nal order, including, but not limited to, while the respondent is on probation, the respondent may receive the assistance of private counsel, but the respondent shall communicate directly with Board staff. Written communicati ons from the Board will only be sent to the respondent. 443 1 GENERAL LAWS GENERAL LAWS 2 Appx B DISCIPLINARY GUIDELINES Penalties by Business and Professions Code Section Number Section 4883(a); 4836.2(c)(5); 4837(b); 4842(d); 480(a)(1); 490 Violation Conviction of a crime substantially related to the qualications, functions, or duties of veterinary medicine, surgery, or dentistry, in which case the record of the conviction shall be conclusive evidence.

These ionized molecules may be inactivated and cell death may result. There is a greater variation in the response of different tissues to radiation. The cells most sensitive to radiation are those which divide the most actively -examples include: epithelium, hematopoietic cells, cells l ining the small intestine, and reproductive cells. The fetus is particularly sensitive to radiation. Cells more resistant to the effects of radiation include those cells which do not actively divide such as nerve and muscle cells. Ionizing radiation can cause both somatic and genetic damage. An example of somatic damage is a squamous cell carcinoma developing on the hand of an individual who received a high level of radiation exposure to the hand. Genetic damage produces injury to the reproductive cells of the exposed individual. Such damage may result in birth defects in children born to the exposed person (Birth defects may also appear in children born in later generations). The effects of radiation may be demonstrated almost i mmediately, or they may be latent and not observed for a long period of time. Examples of immediate effects of radiation include erythema of the skin following radiation therapy. Latent effects develop slowly and may not become apparent until years after the exposure. Slowly developing cataracts in the eyes of a person with small but chronic exposure to radiation could exemplify the latent effects of radiation exposure. The radiation risks of most concer n to veterinary radiographers are the sensitivity of unprotected areas of the body (i.e. the lens of the eye) and the cumulative effects of radiation. Although the cumulative effects of radiation are less understood than the effects of a single massive dose of radiation to the whole body, the repeated exposure of an individual to small amounts of radiation day after day can add up to potent ially harmful levels. Chronic exposure of individuals to low levels of radiation is believed to produce the following effects: Increase in the incidence of neoplasia. Specic increase in the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma. Increase in the frequency of occurrence of leukemia. Premature aging. Responsibilities of the licensed veterinarian Following California Code of Regulations requirements including the federal standards of protection against radiation and applicable dose limits as incorporated by reference in Section 30253 of the California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 17. Providing the employee with reasons for the requirements. Veterinarians are not required to provide individual monitoring devices unless employees are likely to receive a radiation dose in excess of 10 percent of 468 GENERAL LAWS RADIATION SAFETY GUIDE Appx C the listed limit during one year. Most veterinarians have elected to provide individual monitors, however, other means of monitoring exposure are acceptable. Explaining the available options for protecting the embryo/fetus. Considerations for occupationally exposed women of childbearing age California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Section 30255 states that each California licensed veterinarian must instruct occupationally exposed individuals (veterinary radiographers) of the health protection problems associated with radiation. A special situation arises with occupationally exposed women of childbearing age. Precaution should be taken by limiting exposure to young women, especially if they are pregnant. X-ray exposure to the abdomen of such wor kers would involve a radiation dose to the embryo or fetus. Reasons for these requirements Some studies have shown that there is an increased risk of leukemia and other cancers in children if the expectant mother was exposed to a signicant amount of radiation. Women employees must be aware of possible risks so they can take appropriate steps to protect their offspring. Considerations for the embryo/fetus Regulatory provisions (1 0 CFR 20, Section 20.1208): The licensed veterinarian shall ensure that the dose to an embryo/fetus during the entire pregnancy, due to occupational exposure of a declared pregnant woman, does not exceed 0.5 rem (500 millirems or 5 milli Seiverts (mSv)). The licensed veterinarian shall make efforts to avoid substantial variation above a uniform monthly exposure rate to a declared pregnant woman so as to satisfy the limit in paragraph (a) of Section 20.1208. The dose to an embryo/fetus shall be taken as the deep dose equivalent to the declared pregnant woman. If the dose to an embryo/fetus is found to have exceeded 0.5 rem (5 mSv), plus or minus 0.05 rems, by the time the woman declares the pregnancy to the licensed veterinarian, the veterinarian shall be deemed to be in compliance with paragraph (a) of Section 20.1208 if the additional dose to the embryo/fetus does not exceed 0.05 rems (0.5 mSv) during the remainder of the pregnancy. Once a woman declares her pregnancy in writing, the radiation dose of the embryo/fetus shall be no greater than 0.05 rems (50 millirems) in any month (excluding medical exposure). Female employees should be aware of the following facts: The rst three mont hs of pregnancy are the most important as the embryo/ fetus is most sensitive to radiation at this time. In most cases of occupational exposure, the actual dose received by the embryo/ fetus is less than the dose received by the mother, because some of the dose is absorbed by the mother's body. At the present occupational dose equivalent limits, the risk to the unborn baby is considered to be small, but experts disagree on the exact amount of risk. There is no need for women to be concerned about sterility or loss of ability to bear children from occupational exposure that is within legal limits. Once a woman declares her pregnancy in writing, the rad iation dose of the embryo/fetus shall be no greater than 0.05 rems in any month. The 0.5 rems dose equivalent limit applies to the full nine months of pregnancy. It is strongly suggested that the instruction be given both orally and in writing. Also, each woman employee should be given an opportunity to ask questions, and each woman employee should be asked to acknowledge in writing that the instruction has been received. Further, it would be prudent to keep records of such acknowledgment 469 GENERAL LAWS Appx C RADIATION SAFETY GUIDE indenitely. Considerations for Individuals Under the Age of 18 years Young individuals are considered to be at a greater risk of radiation injury because of their more rapidly reproducing cells. Thus, all individuals under the age of 18 shall be excluded from performing or assisting in the performance of radiographic examinations. Section 2: Competency and Training of Veterinary Radiographers According to Section 4840.7 of the California Veterinary Medicine Practice Act, a registered veterinary technician (RVT) who has been examined by the Veterinary Medical Board in the area of radiation safety and techniques may operate radiographic equipment under indirect supervision of a licensed veterinarian. An unregistered assistan t may operate radiographic equipment under the direct supervision of an RVT or a licensed veterinarian. Section 3: Personnel Monitoring Personnel monitoring equipment (devices) Personnel monitoring equipment consists of devices designed to be worn or carri ed for the purpose of measuring the radiation dose received by an individual in the course of employment, education, or training. Personnel monitoring equipment/devices include: lm badges, thermolumnescent dosimeters (TLD), pocket dosimeters, and or wrist badges [see CFR Section 20.1003 and CCR Section 30100 (m)]. Film and TLD badges are the most commonly used radiation monitoring devices by the veterinary profession. Personnel monitors may be performed either on a monthly or quarterly basis. Location of personnel monitoring equipment (devices) A monitoring device must be worn at the thyroid level on the collar outside the apron. Also if the fluoroscopy is used, an additional ring or wrist band must be worn. Section 4: Occupational Dose Equivalent Limits Compliance with occupational exposure requirements - [Maximum Permissible Dose equivalent (MPD)] The essential goal of radiation safety is to prevent injury from exposure to ionizing radiation. For this reason, CFR 20, Section 20.1201, establishes the following annual or yearly occupational dose equivalent limits: Whole body (total effective dose equi valent): 5 rems. Skin and extremities (shallow dose equivalents): 50 rems. Lens of the eye (eye dose equivalent): 15 rems. The regulations distinguish the following: Occupational dose equivalent limits for adults (persons over 18 years of age). Occupational dose equivalent limits for persons under 18 years of age (may receive 10 percent of the adult occupational dose limits). This is one reason why young people should not be allowed to work in the x -ray room. Dose equivalent limits for general population. Radiation dose to an embryo/fetus (prenatal radiation exposure). Section 5: Veterinary Radiographic Machine Requirements X- ray Tube Housing The x-ray tube housing must be of a diagnostic type. The x -ray beam is generated within a vacuum tube containing a cathode with a tungsten wire lament, and an anode target, usually made of tungsten. The x -ray tube itself is enclosed in a metal housing, with a window through which the useful or primary x-ray beam passes. 470 GENERAL LAWS RADIATION SAFETY GUIDE Appx C Collimating device A rectangular collimating device, equipped with a light localizer indicating the size and location of the area to be exposed to x-rays, which is capable of restricting the useful beam to the area of clinical interest, shall be provided. Failure to limit or restrict the x-ray beam only to the area of clinical interest represents one of the most frequent causes of violating the collimation requirement. X- rays that extend beyond the area of clinical interest serve no useful function, increase scatter, and must be eliminated by careful collimation. There should be an unexp osed border on two opposing sides of the lm, proving that the x-ray beam did not exceed the size of the lm cassette. By decreasing the amount of tissue exposed, the amount of scatter radiation produced is also reduced, thus reducing the scatter radiation exposure to personnel. Clinically, reduction of the size of the x -ray beam improves the diagnostic quality of the lm by lessening the amount of fog caused by scatter radiation. X- ray beam ltration The regulations specify the amount of total ltration required for veterinary x -ray machines to be at least 1.5 millimeters (mm) of aluminum -equivalent for equipment operating up to 70 kilovolt peak (kVp) and at least 2.0 mm of aluminum -equivalent for equipment operating over 70 kVp. Diagnostic x -rays tubes use aluminum or its equivalent as the lter material. Except for the window through which the primary useful beam passes, most x -ray tubes are surrounded by oil for electrical insulation and keeping the tube cool. When x- rays leave the tube they must pass through the window's glass covering which adds a small amount of inherent ltration. The amount of inherent ltration produced by most diagnostic x-ray tubes usually ranges from 0.5 to 0.8 mm aluminum -equivalent. The ability of the x -ray beam to penetrate through the animal patient and to expose the x-ray lm is dependent upon its energy measured in kilovolts peak (kVp). The x -ray beam is made up of rays of different energies. Only the x-rays with higher energies (i.e., shorter wavelength) can penetrate the tissue of the animal body and react with the emulsion of the lm. The lower energy (i.e., long wavelength) x -rays do not penetrate the patient, a nd therefore do not contribute to the diagnostic quality of the radiograph. It is desirable to remove the low energy rays from the x -ray beam. This can be readily accomplished by placing a lter in the path of the useful or primary beam. A lter functions by absorbing preferentially the low energy (long wavelength) x -rays before they reach the patient, while allowing the high energy (short wavelength) x-rays to pass through. [Section 30306(f)]. Exposure cord The exposure cord on the hand or foot s witch cannot be less than six feet in length. [Section 30314(a)(5)]. Exposure timer The x -ray machine must have a device to terminate the exposure after a preset time or exposure. [Section 202114(a)(4)]. Exposure switch The exposure switch must be of the dead- man type. [Section 30314(a)(5)]. Registration requirement Every person possessing a reportable source of radiation shall register with the California Department of Public Health, Radiologic Health Branch [(RHB) www.cdph. ca.gov/rhb ] in accordance with the provisions of Sections 30110 through 30146. [Section 30108]. Initial registration (a) Every person not already registered who acquires a reportable source of radiation shall register with and pay the fee as specied in Section 30145 to RHB within 30 days of the date of acquisition. (b) Every person who intends to acquire a radiation machine capable of operating at a potential in excess of 500 kvp shall notify RHB at least 60 days prior to his/her 471 GENERAL LAWS Appx C RADIATION SAFETY GUIDE possession of the machine or at least 60 days prior to the commencement of construction or reconstruction of the room which will house the machine, whichever occurs rst. This equipment shall not be used to treat patients until written approval of provisions for radiation safety has been obtained by the user from RHB. [Section 30110] (c) Every person who registers or renews a registration shall complete a separate registration form furnished by RHB for each separate installation. Renewal of registration Registration must be renewed with RHB on or before the registration expiration date. Report of change The registrant shall report in writing to RHB. Within 30 days of any change in: Registrants name, address, location of the installation, receipt, sale, transfer, disposal, or discontinuance of use of x -ray machine. [Section 30115] Vendor Obligation A vendor must inform the receiver of the radiation machine of the registration requirements [Section 30118]. Records to be maintained Record of individual monitoring results must be maintained until the terminations of their registration [10 CRF 20, section 20.2106]. Payment of Fees Each registration and registration renewal requires payment of a fee [Section 30146]. Section 6: Veterinary Radiographer Protective Apparel The operator shall not stand in the beam but be well away from the tube and animal during X-raying [Section 30314(b), Title 17, CCR]. It is the veterinary radiographers responsibility to require that all individuals unnecessary to the radiographic examination leave the x -ray room prior to making an exposure. Anyone who is in the x -ray room at the time of exposure must be behind a protective barrier or must wear a protective apron of preferably 0.5 mm lead- equivalent but not less than 0.25 millimeters of lead- equivalent. Lead impregnated leather or vinyl is used to make aprons and gloves worn by those individuals who must remain in the x -ray room when an exposure is made. The minimum requirement for both aprons and glov es is 0.25 millimeters of lead equivalent. However, gloves and aprons constructed of 0.5 millimeters of lead-equivalent are available and thus provide greater protection to the radiographer and assistants. A label stating the lead equivalent thickness can be found on the hem of the apron and in the cuff of the glove. Aprons and gloves must be evaluated periodically for tears and cracks to avoid radiation penetration. This evaluation can be ac complished by x -raying the gloves or aprons using a cassette and making a routine exposure. Recommended exposure factors are: 85 kVp, 10 milliampere -second (mAs), 40 inch focal -lm distance. Proper storage of aprons and gloves prolongs their life and effectiveness. Aprons should be hung without creases to prevent cracking. Gloves should be stored so that liners can dry. Gloves and aprons are designed to protect the wearer from scatter radiatio n only they do not reduce the primary x -ray beam enough to provide sufcient protection. The reduction in exposure that results from placing 0.25 mm lead -equivalent apron material in a primary x -ray beam of 100 kVp is 60 percent compared to 0.50 mm lead - equivalent apron material that attenuates the beam by 85 percent. Section 7: Veterinary Radiographer Responsibilities Veterinary radiographers are responsible for adhering to all of the following radiation safety procedures: 472 GENERAL LAWS RADIATION SAFETY GUIDE Appx C 1. Increase or maximize the distance between the operator and the source of radiation. The intensity of the primary x -ray beam, scatter radiation and leakage from the x -ray tube diminishes rapidly as the distance between the operator and the source of radiation increase (approximately by the square of the relative distances). If an operator can increase his or her distance from radiation sources by a factor of two (2), his or her exposure would be reduced to one -fourth of the original amount (four being the square of two). If the distance factor could be tripled, the exposure would be reduced to one -ninth of the original amount (nine being the square of three). When taking radiographs of large animals, use cassette holders to reduce the assistant's exposure to radiation. 2. Use chemical and mechanical restraints whenever possible to eliminate the need for holding a patient during the radiographic exposure. Mechanical restraining devices and positioning aids available to veterinary radiographers include vinyl or foam covered sandbags, foam wedges, plastic or foam troughs, plastic head braces and mouth specula, rope, gauze, tape, Velcro straps, etc. Their proper utilization not only helps reduce radiation exposure to veterinary radiographers but also helps to improve radiographi c quality by preventing patient motion. 3. Use general anesthesia when total immobility and complete relaxation of the animal patient is required for accurate positioning. In all cases, the decision to use anesthetic and tranquilizing agents rests with the attending veterinarian. Tranquilizers may calm the animal patient sufciently to allow some types of mechanical restraining devices to be used. 4. Use appropriate protective devices, such as gloves, aprons, and protective goggles, as well as xed or mobil e barriers such as walls or movable leaded Plexiglas shields. Mobile lead Plexiglas shield that can be positioned in the examination room between the source of radiation and the assistant can cut radiation exposure signicantly. Lead glass goggles offer co nsiderable protection to the lens of the eye. 5. Reduce the duration and amount of exposure. Rare -earth screens can reduce patient dose and the exposure to the personnel f r o m b e t w e e n t w o ( 2 ) a n d v e ( 5 ) t i m e s w i t h o u t a n y l o s s o f i m a g e q u a l i t y compared to older Acalcium tungstate screens. From the standpoint of radiation safety, intensifying screens of this type are highly advantageous. Use a lm type proper for screen emittance. For example, blue -light -emitting screens should not be used with greensensitive lm and vice versa. Such a lm/screen mismatch will result in image degradation and increased radiation exposure. Low-absorption cas sette fronts (such as Bakelite or carbon ber reinforced plastic) offer minimum ltration of the x -rays passing through the cassette and can aid in keeping patient dose at a minimum. Use high kVp techniques that are appropriate for the body part being x-rayed, permitting the veterinary radiographer to lower the mAs settings and decrease radiation levels. Kilovoltage determines the penetrating ability (quality) of the x-ray beam whereas mAs determines the amount (quantity) of x-radiation. The x -ray imagi ng process starts with the normal x -ray machine, the animal patient and the x-ray cassette arranged in the usual positions. The difference is that the digital cassette contains a reusable phosphor plate, which is sensitive to x-rays but not light. Once the plate has been exposed, it is fed into a laser computer reader, which captures the image in a digital format. The reader 473 GENERAL LAWS Appx C RADIATION SAFETY GUIDE then resets the plate ready for reuse. The phosphor plates are expensive but can be reused several thousand times; they are also more x -ray sensitive than lm, allowing a slightly lower radiation dose to be used. The advantages of this process over lm developing are the elimination of the expensive lm, the absence of toxic developing chemicals and the speed. Within 30 seconds, the image is visible, so if the image needs to be repeated for technical reasons this can be done immediately. The radiographer orientates the image on the monitor according to established protocols and can alter the contrast and grey scale (a process known as \"windowing\"). The company who supplies the digital equipment should provide information on the recommended receptor exposu re factors to ensure diagnostic images with the lowest possible dose for each particular examination. It is important for each veterinary practice to set up quality assurance systems to routinely monitor factors including clinical exposure constancy and imaging system sensitivity. Digital radiography systems may have different x-ray energy responses to lm screen systems. Therefore, the technical exposure factors should be different for that used for lm screen systems. For existing systems that have been upgraded to use digital radiography or computed radiography, the existing exposure protocols should be adjusted to reflect as 30-50% reduction in mAs and or exposure time. Each image, whether produced on lm or soft copy display, should ideally have an associated number to indicate the level of exposure to the detector. Currently all computed radiography systems have a sensitivity index which is related to detector exposure, however, digital radiography systems are generally not supplied with this feature. Once computed radiography and digital radiography are in use, the constancy of applied exposure factors should be monitored on a regular basis. 6. Plan radiographic procedures carefully and avoid unnecessary retakes Every examination that m ust be repeated results in doubling the radiation received by the patient and by personnel. Retakes represent one of the biggest causes of excessive and unnecessary radiation exposure to veterinary radiographers. The production of quality radiographs is a complex process demanding careful attention to each detail. Some of the principal factors relating to the production of quality radiographs are: o Patient positioning. o The body part of clinical interest should be centered on the lm. o The body part should be perpendicular to the central main x-ray beam and parallel to the lm. o Align the x -ray tube with the lm (cassette). o Ensure correct focal -lm distance is correct (usually 40 inches). o Proper techniques selection. o Precisely measure the body part for use with a technique chart. Section 8: Darkroom Quality Assurance Requirements (General Provisions) A consistent routine should be established in the darkroom. Smoking, eating, or drinking should not be permitted in the darkroom. The darkroom should be kept free of dust. Counter tops and processor feed trays should be cleaned daily. 474 GENERAL LAWS RADIATION SAFETY GUIDE Appx C Darkroom safe lights should be equipped with an appropriate lter and bulb combination. Screens should be cleaned to remove artifacts. Screen cleaner, recommended by the screen manufactu rer, should be used on a regular basis \u2014not less than monthly. Films should be handled carefully to prevent artifacts due to static electricity or ngerprints. The developer and the xer tanks should be covered to prevent oxidation. Boxes of unexposed lm should be stored upright and in a protected area away from scatter radiation. Expired lm stock should be removed from use. For digital image processing, strict adherence to the manufacturer's quality assurance and system maintenance manuals is critical in order to take full advantage of any digital radiography system. \"Windowing\" an image to make it diagnostically acceptable is not an alternative for using the correct technical factors in producing the initial image. Section 9: Manual Film Developing Proper development of lm is very important in optimizing diagnostic quality radiographs and reducing the number of retakes. An x-ray lm should never be overexposed in order to shorten the developing time. A lm that has been overexposed and underdeveloped tends to lose most of its diagnostic quality and results in a signicant increase in exposure to the animal patient and veterinary radiographer. Developing for ve (5) minutes at 68-70 degrees Fahrenheit (see Table below) produces optimum diagnostic quality lms. Since the correct developing time varies with the temperature of the developing solution, measurements must be made with an accurate thermometer and timer each time a lm is developed. Full Film Development Techniques Developer Temperature (Fahrenheit) Minimum time (minutes) 64-66 7 68-70* 5* 72-76 4 *Optimum temperature and time combination. The temperature of developing solutions should not exceed 75 degrees Fahrenheit, or fall below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. Developing solutions function correctly only within the above noted temperature range. Solutions should be stirred well before use. Separate stirring paddles must be used for the developer and xer. In addition, veterinary radiographers must follow the following rules: Use solutions designed for medical x-ray purposes. Change solutions regularly and replenish solutions per manufacturer's recommendations.* Avoid contaminating solutions. Keep lms in the xer solution for at least 10 minutes. Wash lms in a running water bath for at least 30 minutes. Dry lms thoroughly. *NOTE: Silver recovery systems must meet environmental protection laws and regulations. 475 GENERAL LAWS Appx C RADIATION SAFETY GUIDE Specically, processing less than 500 gallons per month of silver -containing photographic solutions qualies a generator to be conditionally exempt if the waste is: Hazardous only for silver. Treated on-site within 90 days. The silver concentration is reduced to a level less than ve (5) milligrams per liter (mg/l).
