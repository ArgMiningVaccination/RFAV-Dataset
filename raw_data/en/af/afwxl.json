By promoting their wellbeing, we promote their excellence. - Santa J. Ono, President and Vice-Chancellor In June 2020, the UBC Department of Pediatrics (DoP) and Research Education Services (BCCHR), were awarded a Special COVID-19 Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) grant from the UBC Faculty of Medicine to launch a health and wellness program to support psychological and physical wellbeing and to create social connections and shared experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2018, the DoP and BCCHR have executed several joint health initiatives at the C&W campus, through a combination of grants or by sharing financial and human resources. Our programming leans heavily on the preventative quality of mind/body activities to teach mental, physical and emotional resilience to people under extreme duress. The word \"intention\" derives from the same base word of \"tendency\" and \"invoke\" and WellBEing, as we spell it, puts the emphasis on simply to \"BE\". By taking good care of yourself in this moment in time is an act of self-care and self-compassion during these challenging times. In 2016, UBC was one the first universities to adopt the Okanagan Charter which asked its signatories to embed \"health into all aspects of campus culture, across the administration, operations and academic mandates.\" As one of the first to adopt the Charter, UBC outlined six priority areas in the [Wellbeing Strategic Framework](https://wellbeing.ubc.ca/framework). Intentional WellBEing aligns its programming with 5 of the 6 priority areas as outlined in UBC's Wellbeing Strategic Framework which are: Collaborative Leadership, Mental Health & Resilience, Food & Nutrition, Social Connection, Built & Natural Environments and Physical Activity.

Guided breathwork is a powerful yet simple practice to help ease stress and anxiety, process emotions and to heal physical pain while coming back to your true nature. We breathe around 25,000 times a day yet most of us are not taught how to breathe efficiently or how to process emotions. It is never too late to improve your breath pattern and learn a tool to move energy in your body. WHO IS IT FOR? This breathwork series is for everyone! All levels, all abilities, and especially those curious about the nature of breathwork to heal and clear are welcome to join. This practice can be particularly powerful during times of stress, grief, transition, and when navigating new beginnings.

After attending a small Breathwork class where he had a life-changing and out of body experience, he knew that he had found something beyond important!

He has since trained with some of the top Breathwork teachers and has gone on to share this incredible healing modality with thousands of people both privately and in groups. He specializes in combining Breathwork with The Hawaiian forgiveness practice of Ho'Oponopono to help people shift into more self-love, forgiveness, and gratitude for themselves, their life, and for others.

Doctors take an oath to treat all patients equally, and yet not all patients are treated equally well. The answer to why is complicated. Why are doctors sometimes the targets of bias and racism? Recent published reports include overt bigotry expressed towards doctors of black, Indian and Jewish heritage. Several medical journals have just published guidelines for doctors with titles like \"Dealing with Racist Patients\" and \"The Discriminatory Patient and Family: Strategies to Address Discrimination Towards Trainees.\" And can we fix this? Articles addressing racism in medicine suggest many of the same things. To fight racism and discrimination, we all need to recognize, name, and understand these attitudes and actions. We need to be open to identifying and controlling our own implicit biases.

SESSION 1: Breathwork & Ho'Oponopono with Jay Bradley | NOON-1 pm | July 27 2021 Jay's back to lead us for a special one-hour breathwork session. More about Jay and his path as a healer: I grew up in a small town in Canada called Thunder Bay. I was an extra sensitive kid, which led to constant bullying and physical attacks from Kindergarten to high school. I learned to hide who I was and slowly put layers of protection up in order to fit in and, at the very least, to survive. Knowing I was gay didn't help matters, so I worked even harder to hide the truth. I used overspending, sex, sleep, coffee, and perfectionism to numb out. However, the pain prompted me to begin a spiritual and emotional journey, which I've been on for over 30 years. I began to understand that my lack of self-love, self-worth, and the shame I felt for simply being me had taken over and that it would require work to remember who I really was. Since then, I've worn many hats. I have worked as a model and actor, catering manager, fitness trainer, health & wellness coach, Reiki master, hypnotist, and massage therapist. Meanwhile, I have experienced numerous healing modalities in my search to reconnect with my center. Then an invite to a small Breathwork group completely changed my life! It was as if I had released a lifetime of pain, shame, fear, self-loathing and grief in one session! I was blown away and also, completely hooked. I quickly made my life mission to learn more about Breathwork, and then share this unbelievable healing modality with as many people as I could. What inspires me the most is when I can help somebody to speed up their transformation from pain to freedom, to resurrect their life, and to remember who they truly are! My mission is to reconnect people with their inner power and purpose so they can get busy living the life that they deserve! Facilitator: Jay Bradley, Breathwork Healer SESSION 2: The Art of Mary Delany: Mixed-Media class with Michelle Man, BFA | NOON-1 pm | July 28 2021 Get out the Modge Podge and roll up your sleeves, things are about to get a bit messy!

SESSION 5: 145-245 pm | Nov 27 2020 As healthcare providers, we all face situations where our ability to engage in best practice is challenged by lack of resources, inequities, systemic racism, the pandemic context, and countless other difficulties. Over time, these experiences can lead to \"compassion fatigue\" and burnout.

Rescheduled to 3-4 pm | Dec 11 2020 There is a popular quote amongst tea practitioners in Japanese traditions: \"The taste of Tea and Zen are one.\" This opens the door to an understanding that earnestly practicing tea, with your whole mind and heart, is equal effort to time spent on a meditation cushion. Tea is about abiding in the present moment, witnessing the reactive mind, and calmly learning to accept and be with what is. - Tea Journey Facilitator: Dr. Dzung Vo, MD, FRCPC, Head, Adolescent Health & Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, UBC & BCCH and Director, BC Children's Centre for Mindfulness Dr. Dzung Vo is a pediatrician specializing in adolescent medicine; the founding director of the BC Children's Hospital Centre for Mindfulness; and a clinical associate professor and division head for the Division of Adolescent Health and Medicine, DoP at BCCH and UBC.

Instructor: Michelle Man, BFA, Department of Pediatrics, UBC & BCCH 12-1pm | June 11 2021 Resilience is a remarkable construct - an overarching metaphor that touches on the arenas of stress, neural plasticity, emotional health, recovery, healing, mental illness, adaptation, defendedness, and therapy. It is relevant to everyone in most every caring role, particularly, in healthcare where burn out levels are high due to the chronic stress characteristic of the environments healthcare workers exist on a day-to-day basis. Fresh understandings are coming to the fore as we glean more working knowledge of the brain as well as the nature of emotion. The implications for working with children are profound, never mind the implications for dealing with stress in our own lives and in the lives of our loved ones. The construct of resilience, once truly understood, is universal in its application. We all face adversity; no one is immune. Knowing how to foster resilience and recovery should be one of our main conceptual tools for taking care of ourselves and those who depend upon us. The knowledge of resilience has universal application. No person, parent or teacher should be without these understandings. But neither should any helping professionals, as this knowledge informs the helping relationship.
