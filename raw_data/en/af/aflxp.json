The strain of the virus can change from year to year and even within the same year. People who get the flu may have fever, chills, headache, dry cough and muscle aches and may be sick for several days, a week or more. Most people completely recover from the flu. However, for some people, the flu may be especially severe and pneumonia or other complications may develop. This injection contains homeopathic medications that fight together to ward off the flu, as well as other infections that can cause the common cold. This injection works by stimulating the natural immune response against symptoms of the flu. It also strengthens the nonspecific defense system of the body to prevent any virus or bacteria from infecting a person. In-vitro studies show that this injection stimulates the immune system to perform at 41% higher than it's natural reaction. FAQs: - How is this different from the Flu Vaccine? The Natural Flu Prevention Shot does not contain any type of virus. It works by stimulating your immune system to be ready to fight off ANY virus or bacteria it may encounter, not just one. - If I get this shot, can I still get the flu? Unfortunately, yes. This depends on the overall health of your immune system. The good news is that if you start to feel like you are getting sick, you can get another shot to again stimulate your immune system. You can also take advantage of the many natural treatments for the flu so that you recover quicker and don't get as sick. - Are there any known side effects? No. - Is this injection safe for everyone? Yes. Anyone can safely receive this shot, whether young or old. Since the injection simply works with your own immune system without known side effects or preservatives, everyone can safely use it. - Are there any preservatives in the Natural Flu Shot? No. Unlike the conventional flu shot, this injection avoids the use of any preservatives. - If I have already received the traditional flu shot, can I get the Natural Flu Prevention Shot? Yes. Since the traditional flu shot aims at only one virus and since it works by an entirely different mechanism, it is not only safe but recommended that you receive the Natural Flu Shot. Remember that the Natural Flu Shot helps your body's immune system fight off all viruses and bacteria. - How much does it cost? $25 - unless you come in Monday's 12:30-4:30 or Thursday's 9-12:30 and then they are only $20! - Do I need to make an appointment to get the shot? Monday afternoons and Thursday mornings you do not need an appointment, however you do need to make an appointment any other time or day of the week. Keep in mind that we typically have appointments available the same day that you call. "}
