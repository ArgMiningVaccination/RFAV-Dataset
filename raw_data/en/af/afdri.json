How to meditate with crystals The benefits of meditation with crystals are plentiful. While it is possible to meditate without any item, meditation with crystals can help you focus and may help you feel more grounded. Here is how to integrate gemstones into your meditation practice: 1. Choose your crystal There are many fantastic crystals you can use for meditation. Each gemstone has unique properties that you can benefit from. The crystal you choose for your practice mostly depends on what you want to get out of your meditation. If you're a beginner in crystal healing, I'd recommend choosing Clear Quartz because it can be used even if you don't have a specific intention in mind. However, if you have a specific intention in mind, something you want to focus on, I recommend checking different crystal properties to see which one would be best. 2. Find a quiet space Find a quiet room in your home that you can turn into a meditation haven. Make sure it is clean, tidy, and organized. You can add herbs, incense, or candles to make the space even more comfortable. Prepare your space so that it inspires you to go further in your quest of centering yourself. The most important is to find a comfortable chair, sofa, or cushion to sit on. You can also lie down if you prefer. The more you practice, the easier it will be for you to find the perfect setting for your meditation sessions. 3. Try a guided meditation The purpose of guided meditation is to bring mental, emotional, and physical clarity. If you're new to meditation with crystals, I would recommend starting with this type of meditation. The main benefit of guided meditations is that they easily lead you to a deep meditative state of being. It is more difficult to reach this state when you meditate by yourself, especially if you've never meditated before. You can find many different guided meditations with crystals on youtube. Some of my favorites include [this crystal meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_G8BMFKSPwg) to attune to your crystal and [this rose quartz meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeaPMequgYQ). 4. Connect with your gemstone If you decide to meditate by yourself, the next step is to connect to your gemstone. The easiest way to connect with your chosen crystal is to have physical contact with it. Once you're ready to begin your meditation, hold your crystal in your hands or place it somewhere on your body. For example, if you chose a green crystal, you could place it on your heart because it connects to the heart chakra. You can also meditate with your gemstone without touching it. You can place it in front of you or next to you while you meditate. Another option is to use it as a point to focus on. Choose the option that you feel most comfortable with, as long as you get some sort of connection with your stone. 5. Make your practice personal Last but not least, it is important to make your practice personal. This means you should choose one or more crystals that you feel drawn to, meditate for as long as you need, and decide for yourself what makes you feel comfortable. I can only recommend trying to meditate with different stones to experiment and see what you prefer. With time and practice, you'll find a way to practice that suits you perfectly! Bottom line Meditation with crystals has many health benefits. Crystals that are connected to the crown chakra are usually better for meditation because they promote psychic abilities and open consciousness. However, when it comes to mindfulness, the best option is to simply choose the crystal you are drawn to or the one that fits with your intention. If you're new to meditation, try starting your practice with a guided meditation. It will be easier for you to stay focused. Connect with your gemstone, and most importantly make your practice personal. What crystals for meditation are your favorites? Let me know in the comments below! Did you enjoy reading "}
