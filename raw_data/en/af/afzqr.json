These sessions help people to understand themselves more - their actions and reactions to life. Why they react in the way that they do when something comes up to stress them and gives an insight into other actions and reactions too. By understanding ourselves at a deeper level, we are more able to recognise when we are getting triggered and what it may be connecting to on an even deeper level still....there are more levels to being who we are than are noticeable on the surface. For me, by understanding myself more - I am more able to be the person I want to be ~ and all that I can be! The Processes I use are - Sessions of Brief TA and Rewriting Your Life Script through the process of Fairy Tales In these sessions we look at the various TA models, plus a few more useful models and how they connect with what you are seeking help with. I also include Resilience Analysis in this process too - looking at what your Resilience tools are so that you can use them to good effect and to know which to turn to at any given moment. This takes self-care to beyond a superficial plaster, to a much deeper restorative level. Some of the models are: Drama Triangles and The Games people play. This is a great model for helping people to recognise whether they are stepping into Victim, Rescuer or Persecutor modes and importantly - how to step out of them. Struggling Adult and The Ego States - how we can recognise our inner voices, both to ourselves and in communication with others - Critical/Nurturing Parent, Panicky/Pleasing Child and how we can work with them to understand ourselves more and to Strengthen our Adult voice The Ok Coral - I'm Ok~ You're Ok and how this helps us to recognise we all have \"stuff\" going on. This is also about how we see ourselves in the world too. Autonomy and Agency - Recognising that we are all important, we are all valid, and being able to be tolerant of others whilst also taking back more control over our own lives, so that we can be all we can be ~ all we want to be, but whilst recognising that others have that right too. Window of Tolerance - a great model to help us to self assess - an aid to keeping ourselves safe in an ever stressful and fast paced world. I loved doing this process for myself and am much more able to self-monitor and to self-correct, and to understand not only my life in the here and now - but back in the there and then situations too. So much easier too to recognise drama triangles - especially the ones that aren't mine so I can choose to not get involved in them, or carry them! For those who want to go deeper still - who feel that they aren't getting from their life what they really want, don't feel that they are living their truth, or feel there is something that is out of their reach in life, they keep getting the same results not recognising and realising they have repeat patterns going on, so are just going round in loop with the same old same old reactions, responses and results happening, then looking at Rewriting your Life Script through the Fairy Tale process could be for you! The Fairy Tale process looks more in-depth at an issue you want to change, and the impact it would have on you if you don't change it - but also the impact and difference it would make to you if you DO change it. We look in greater depth at: What drives you (be strong, try hard, please others, be perfect, hurry up); The stories you were told around \"don't\" e.g., don't succeed - don't be you - don't exist - don't make it - don't get close-be loved - don't feel - don't think - don't be important.... The \"Injunctions\" (the labels) that were \"given\" - either told verbally to us by caregivers, parents, siblings etc, or we heard indirectly, or felt viscerally (physically) in our tissues, that then became our hidden beliefs about our selves and our perceptions of how life was lived - what we had to do to survive and make sense of how life was lived - how we needed to live it, to get our needs met. We did this through our eyes as a child (usually age 3 to 5 or 7) ......that we then subconsciously wrote into our \"Life Script\" which is still affecting many aspects of our life in the adult world. We wrote this as a Fairy Tale, so to rewrite our Life Script - we have to rewrite our Fairy Tale. Then after a further process of looking at life now and what you want to be different in it - I support and walk with you as you explore what Fairy Tale you might fit into, have written subconsciously for yourself, - and then you rewrite it! But instead of just \"and they all lived Happily Ever After\", you get to write how you want your happily ever after to be. We do this by changing the Injunctions - the \"Don'ts\", for \"Permissions to\".... writing into your Fairy tale the permissions to: Be You; to Succeed; to Belong; To think; to Feel; To Be Important; To Make it - giving yourself Permission to be ALL that you WANT to be ~ ALL that YOU can be! Reclaiming your actual truth to being who YOU truly are! We also Anchor our \"New\" Fairy Tale into the subconscious, using various techniques, so that we can sense it and feel it - emotionally, mentally, energetically, physically, spiritually - connecting more with our place in the \"here and now Adult\" world - giving ourselves permission to truly embrace the \"happier ending\" that we crave - and deserve, whilst still connecting on an inner child level - because it was our child who wrote it, so our inner child needs to feel it, and carry it with us at that deeper inner subconscious level too. The more we can connect with it, the more we can anchor it - the more we can be it! For me - having taken this whole journey - from TDT massage treatments, SEM, the sessions of Brief TA, The Life Script -Fairy Tale process helped me to put my early years into even more perspective still. It helped me to remember some good times, to connect with things I had forgotten, to take the hurt and pain out of it - and actually to add humour, which helped to further dissipate and soothe the deeper held Traumas and pain. After I had done the process, I felt like so much weight had been lifted, it was so cathartic, so releasing. I felt like I was more in control of my life, where it could go - where I could go, what I could achieve - and who is to say that I couldn't!! It is after all only someone else's opinion which had been buried in the very depths of my subconscious. It was - and is (in my opinion) a very empowering process, feeling like I am more in the driving seat of my life. My Training and Supervision work as a Psycho-Tactile Therapist is via the Gerry Pyves Academy of Psycho-Tactile Therapies and Accredited by the National Council of Psychotherapists. Put simply - Aromatherapy is the use of Essential Oils to bring about change in the body. Essential Oils are oils that are present within the root, bark, leaf or flower of an aromatic plant. The oils are contained in the form of tiny droplets which are extracted from the plant matter using various methods, the most common being steam distillation. Although they are called \"oils\" they have a non-oily feel and generally, with only a few exceptions, essential oils should not be used neat on the skin. They have many properties and uses. As well as being known to calm, relax or de-stress, they can also be energising, stimulating, or uplifting; many are known to have anti-viral, anti-bacterial or anti-inflammatory properties and uses too. As a caution, there are also some oils which shouldn't be used with some medications, medical conditions and during pregnancy, and that is why I always check for contra-indications prior to blending for clients. As a Clinical Aromatherapist I am trained to blend, so I don't use pre-bought/blended oil mixes. So just as I tailor each and every massage treatment to the client's needs and outcomes from each session, I blend specifically for the client. That way I can tailor the blend to suit the client's needs, making each treatment session totally unique and why no two treatment sessions are ever the same. Any massage treatment can be an \"aromatherapy\" massage just by adding essential oils into the carrier oil (Please note there will be an additional cost for the oil blend). However, because I blend specifically for the clients needs at the time of the treatment session, additional time will be required to do this, so it is best to be absolutely clear about what you want to achieve from the treatment session so the focus can be making sure the blend is right for your outcomes and needs. Please be sure to let me know when you book your appointment that you would like aromatherapy oils to be used in your treatment. I may sometimes suggest a blend that I have had previous success with, if dealing with a similar ailment. e.g., the blend I mixed for a client who successfully came off his migraine medication with the approval of his GP; The main blend tweaked slightly by adding Tea Tree to help his athlete's foot problem. And would you believe that blend/cream was used on the feet - yes, the feet to help with migraines! - using a treatment called Swiss Reflex Therapy, which links Aromatherapy with Reflexology I have used other blends I made to help with OCD, another client said the blend I made for Stomach issues was the best thing that they had tried for their IBS in 21 years - I had also used the same blend for Pelvic pain and Digestive/Upset stomach from food poisoning - all to good effect. Although most people know Aromatherapy as being used in relaxing massage treatments, there are many other ways of using essential oils too. I quite often reach for essential oils and make a blend for my bath if I have some \"mind stuff\" going on, or if I have aches and pains and in need of anti-inflammatory oils; I might use a compress for headaches or stomach upsets; put essential oils into a body lotion; and I also use them when I am cleaning - people often comment on how lovely and fresh my home feels and smells. Perfumes, the good ones, are a blend of a variety of essential oils and you can really tell the difference in the aroma. Please note that I only blend for people who attend as clients. Due to new EU regulations, I am not able to sell on blends to non-clients. BUT that has its advantages as it means I can TAILOR make a BESPOKE blend specific to you. "}
