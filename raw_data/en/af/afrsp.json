Ayurveda combines the Sanskrit words for life (ayur) and science or knowledge (veda) and translates into \"the science of life.\" Ayurvedic medicine is a complete system of medical therapies that focuses on preventive and rejuvenative therapies to balance body, mind and soul. Ayurveda includes a variety of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities such as nutritional counseling, herbal medicine, massage therapy and other forms of bodywork, internal cleansing and immune system support. Ayurveda may also be described as the original natural medicine. However, ayurveda is different from other CAM modalities since it employs an entire system of unique diagnostic, preventive and disease management tools and practices.
