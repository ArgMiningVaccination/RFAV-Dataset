I disappro ve of Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bills Nos. 493, 485, 495, 516, 534, 545, 595, 616 & 624. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bills Nos. 493, 485, 495, 516, 534, 545, 595, 616 & 624 is the legislature's attempt to create trans fer solutio ns for students attending schools in unaccre dited districts . Unfo rtunate ly, not only would Conference Committe e Substitute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bills Nos. 493, 485, 495, 516, 534, 545, 595, 616 & 624 not solve the school trans fer problems it was intended to addre ss, it would create new problems that exacerbate the hards hips faced by the childre n who atte nd unaccre dited schools. Conference Subs House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Substitute for Senate Bills Nos. 493, 485, 495, 516, 534, 545, 595, 616 & 624 would autho rize the expenditure of public funds for the tuition of students who trans fer from an unaccre dited school in an unaccre dited district in St. Louis, St. Louis County and Jackson County to private, nonsectarian schools located in the students' district of residence. Altho ugh proponents of this provision claim that only local tax dollars would be expended and that they would be expended only if appro ved by the district's voters, no such vote would be require d after a district has been unaccre dited for three years. Eithe r with or without a vote, the result would be the same\u2014public money would be diverted to private schools, in clear violation of the Missouri Constitutio n.1 In additio n, through its enactme nt of Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bills Nos. 493, 485, 495, 516, 534, 545, 595, 616 & 624, the General Assembly would extend this private school option without holding private schools responsible for how well they educate students. Unlike the accountability to taxpayers that locally elected school boards provide, this scheme for directing public funds to private schools would come with no such protection. Private schools do not have to answer to voters, their leadership does not have to stand for election or re-election, and their budg ets are not trans parent to allow public s crutiny . Acco rding ly, public funds should no t be diverted to priv ate schools. In a particularly cruel reversal of existing law, Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bills Nos. 493, 485, 495, 516, 534, 545, 595, 616 & 624 would also eliminate the current requirement that unaccredited districts pay for the 1 Article III, Section 38(a) of the Misso uri Constitutio n provides: The general assembly shall have no power to grant public money or property, or lend or autho rize the lending of public credit, to any private person, associatio n or corporation, excepting aid in public calam ity, and general laws providing for pensions for the blind, for old age assistanc e, for aid to dependent or cripple d childr en or the blind, for direct relief, for adjuste d compensatio n, bonus or rehabilitatio n for discharged members of the armed services of the United State s who were bona fide residents of this state during their service, and for the rehabilitatio n of other persons.1859 Supplement trans portatio n costs of trans fers. This policy would be grossly unfair to the hundre ds of familie s whose childre n trans ferred to accredited districts during the most recent school year with the unde rstanding that their future trans portatio n costs would be paid by the unaccre dited, sending district. In this way, Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bills Nos. 493, 485, 495, 516, 534, 545, 595, 616 & 624 would pull the rug out from unde r these familie s by eliminating the curre nt obligation to pay for the ir school trans portatio n costs. Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bills Nos. 493, 485, 495, 516, 534, 545, 595, 616 & 624 would also allow receiving districts to discount the tuitio n paid for trans fers in exchang e for not having to consider those students' performance data for accountability purpo ses for up to five years. Enshrining this cynical barg ain in law shortchang es the very trans fer students whose educatio nal struggles this legislation was purpo rted to help. This discount would allow dis tricts to discard the trans fer students they accept and not be held accountable for how they educate these students. As an example , consider trans fers by high school students\u2014a receiving district that accepted these students and extended a 30% tuitio n discount would never need to acco unt fo r the ir acade mic Unre to the school trans fer pro blem it purpo rts to addre ss, Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Substitute for Senate Bills Nos. 493, 485, 495, 516, 534, 545, 595, 616 & 624 also include s a provision very similar to the one I vetoed in Senate Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for House Bill No. 1789 (2012). This provision would deviate from the well-establis hed procedure for assigning a student to another school district if the student's residence is located so as to create an unus ual or unre asonable trans portatio n hards hip. A similar provision did no t meet my appro val in 2012 and ne ither does this one. In accordance with the above-stated reasons for disappro val, I am returning Conference Commi ttee Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bills Nos. 493, 485, 495, 516, 534, 545, 595, 616 & 624 w ithout my appro val.

I disappro ve of House Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 506. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 506 would redefine the term \"livestock\" to include \"captiv e cervids,\" which are members of the deer family , including white-taile d deer. These chang es would eliminate the role of the Missouri Departme nt of Conservation in regulating white-taile d deer. 1861 Supplement Because doing so would be at odds with longstanding successful conservation practice s and would violate the Missouri Co nstitutio n, this legislation does not receive my appro val. For more than 75 years, the Missouri Departme nt of Conservation has restored and protected Missouri's forest, fish, and wildlife resources. The Departme nt has created countle ss oppo rtunitie s for Missourians to enjoy the outdoors, while also making Missouri a natio nal leader in conservation. In 1934, before Missourians voted by more than a two-thirds majority to establis h the Conservation Commis sion in the Missouri Constitutio n, Missouri had less than 2,000 white-taile d deer. Today, Missouri has an estimate d 1.3 millio n white-taile d deer. Each fall, half-a-milli on hunters go afield to harv est deer in Missouri, contributing $1 billio n to our economy. Growing and manag ing our deer herd and fostering the hunting opportunitie s that we enjoy takes hard work and sound science, and the Departme nt of Conservation should be comme nded for emplo ying both to preserve this impo rtant part of our heritag e, not strippe d of its autho rity to do so in order to protect narro w inte rests. House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 506 also does not receive my suppo rt because it very clearly violates the Missouri Constitutio n. Article IV, Section 40(a) o f the Missouri Co nstitutio n vests the Missouri Co nservation Co mmis sion ement, restoratio n, conservation, and regulatio n of the bird fish, game, forestry and all wildlife resources of the state, including hatche ries, sanctuarie s, refuges, reservations and all other property owned, acquire d, or used for such purpo ses and the acquis ition and e stablis hment the reof. White-taile d deer are wildlife , and they are also a game animal. Putting them behind a fence does not chang e that fact. The Constitutio n make s clear that the Conservation Commis sion has the sole autho rity to control, manag e, restore, conserve, and regulate \"game ... and all wildlife \" citize n-suppo rted, citize n-led effort to conserve our forests, fish, and wildlife through this constitutio nal provision has in its more than 75 years made Missouri a natio nal leader in conservation. And in granting the Commis sion this broad constitutio nal autho rity, the 71% of Missouri citize ns who voted to do so certainly did not counte nance that a statuto ry enactme nt to simply redefine the term \"livestock\" could s uffice to unde rmine that autho rity. I note that it is unfortunate that the legislature insisted on amending this unco nstitutional provision to two pieces of legislation that o therwise contain w orthy provisions advancing Missouri ag riculture . In accordance with the above stated reasons for disappr oval, I am returning House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 506 w ithout my appro val. Respectfully submitte d, /s / Jeremiah W . (Jay ) Nix on Governor July 7, 2014 TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE O F THE STATE O F MISSO URI Herewith I re turn to you Ho use Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 508 e ntitle d: AN ACT1862 Journal o f the Senate to enact in lieu thereof nine new sections relating to health insurance , with a pe nalty provision. I disappro ve of House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 508. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 508 co ntains a numbe r of worthw hile provisions that can become law with my actio n on other legislation. However, this legislation does not receive my appro val due to a significant drafting error. House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 508 would impo se additional restrictio ns on the licensure of an indiv idual as a \"nav igator,\" one who provides informatio n or services in connection with eligibility , enrollment, or the program specificatio ns of any health benefit exchang e operating purs uant to the Affordable Care Act. Section 376.2004.6 of the bill would require an applicant for a navigator license to submit tw o full sets of fingerprints to the Missouri State Highway Patro l \"for the purpo se of obtaining a state and federal criminal records check unde r section 43.540 and Public Law 92-554 [sic].\" The bill's reference to Public Law 92-554 should be to Public Law 92-544. This mistaken reference to Public Law 92-554, which deals with alcohol abus e and prevention, instead of to Public Law 92-544, which deals with federal criminal records, was include d in model legislation developed by the Ame rican Legislativ e Exchang e Council (ALEC) entitle d the \"Navigator Backg round Check Act,\" which provides, in re levant part: (4) The {insert state department of insurance} shall submit a full set of fingerprints to the {insert state department of public safety} for the purpo se of obtaining a state and federal criminal records check purs uant to {insert relevant state criminal history records statute} and Public Law 92-554 [sic]. The {insert state department of insurance} shall not issue the registratio n if the person has been convicted of a felony offense or a mis demeanor offense involving fraud o r dishonesty.1 It appe ars that in copying and pasting from this ALEC model act, the General Assembly failed to correct this incorrect reference to Public Law 92-554.2 While some may believe that such an error is \"close enough\" for a model act, it canno t be allowed to become the law of this State . Particularly in an area of the law that is the subject of ongoing litigation, a glaring defect such as this canno t simply be ignored. Acco rding ly, this measure does not receive my appro val. 1The full text of the ALEC Model \"Navigator Background Check Act\" is available at http://www.alec.org/model-legislation/navigator-background- check-act/. 2 Some state legislatures that have considered similar navigator-related legislation derived from the ALEC model legislation have taken the opportunity to fix the incorrect reference from the ALEC model before enacting it. See Arizona House Bill 2508 (2014), available at http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/51leg/2r/laws/0153.pdf. However, like the Missouri General Assembly, other state legislatures considering such legislation have simply parroted the incorrect reference from the ALEC model act without alteration. See Kansas Senate Bill 362 (2014), available at http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2013_14/measures/documents/sb362_01_0000.pdf1863 Supplement In accordance with the above-stated reasons for disappro val, I am returning House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 508 w ithout my appro val. Respectfully submitte d, /s / Jeremiah W . (Jay ) Nix on Governor July 9, 2014 TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE O F THE STATE O F MISSO URI Herewith I re turn to you Senate Bill No . 523 e ntitle d: AN ACT To amend chapte r 167, RSMo , by adding thereto one new section relating to the use of radio frequency identificatio n techno logy in school districts . I disappro ve of Senate Bill No . 523. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: Senate Bill No. 523 is the latest effort by the General Assembly to erode the ability of local school officials to determine what is best for the ir school districts , students and staff. This legislation would ban a school district from requiring a student to use an identificatio n device that emplo ys \"phy sical contact between a card, badg e, or tag and ano ther device.\" Local school officials are in the best position to determine the appro priate use of this techno logy within their school districts . Inde ed, the techno logy sought to be banne d could be a significant public safety tool during emergency situatio ns. Quickly identify ing the locatio n of students during a critical incide nt unfolding at a school or during a natural disaster is vitally impo rtant to law enforcement and first responders. Prohibiting the use of this techno logy would eliminate an impo rtant option for school districts to consider when analy zing measures to protect the safety and s ecurity of the ir students. In additio n, the vague language used in Senate Bill No. 523 fails to distinguish between activ e radio frequency identificatio n technology, which continuo usly trans mits informatio n, and passive radio frequency identificatio n techno logy, which does not, or to indicat e whether such techno logy must be directly assigned to an indiv idual student. As a result, the ban co ntaine d in Senate Bill No. 523 could prohibit tags place d in lapto ps, iPads , or other devices assigned to a student that would be tracke d when brought thro ugh a fix ed portal o r a hand-s canning device. It is inappro priate for the state to impo se restrictio ns such as those containe d in Senate Bill No. 523 upon local educatio n leaders. On issues such as this, local officials should be permitte d to have open and robust discussions with school staff, parents and other interested stakeholders and imple ment programs determine d to be the most appro priate for their districts . Local school officials are in the best position to make such de cisions, and I w ill stand w ith the m by not appro ving Senate Bill No . 523. In accordance with the above stated reasons for disappro val, I am returning Senate Bill No. 523 without my appro val.1864 Journal o f the Senate Respectfully submitte d, /s / Jeremiah W .

I disappro ve of House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 575. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 575 co ntains a numbe r of worthw hile provisions that can be come law with my actio n on other legislation. Ho wever, this legislation does not receive my appro val due to the inclus ion of pro visions limiting the require ment for actuarial analy sis of health ins urance benefit mandate s and re pealing the MO HealthNe t Oversight Co mmitte e. House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 575 w ould re peal the curre nt requirement that an actuarial analy sis be conducte d on any proposed legislation impo sing a ne w health ins urance benefit mandate and re place it with a mo re modest require ment to perform an actuarial analy sis only on health ins urance mandate s actually enacte d by the General As sembly . In so limiting the requirement fo r an actuarial analy sis, House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 575 thw arts the original inte nt of the law, which w as to ensure that the General As sembly fully unde rstood the fiscal impact o f such mandate s prior to their enactme nt. A me asure such as this that w ould limit the informatio n available to policymake rs before they vote to impo se a new mandate does not receive my suppo rt. In additio n, the MO HealthNe t Oversight Co mmitte e consists of a bipartis an group of legislators and experienced Me dicaid pro viders. Ho use Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 575 w ould re peal the MO HealthNe t Oversight Co mmitte e, while making permane nt the Joint Committe e on MO HealthNe t, which is composed exclusively of legislators. The eliminatio n of the MO HealthNe t Oversight Co mmitte e would le ave future responsibility for oversight of Mis souri's Medicaid s ystem without the benefit of formal re presentatio n by indiv iduals with specialize d expertise in the committe e's subject matte r. Oversight of a pro gram o f this significance should draw from the full s pectrum o f available resources and pe rspectives, rathe r than be ing limite d to a select group of public o fficials . In acco rdance with the above-stated reasons for disappro val, I am re turning House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 575 w ithout my appro val. Respectfully submitte d, /s / Jeremiah W .

I disappro ve of Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 584. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: Conference Commi ttee Substitute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 584 would continue a damag ing trend by the General Assembly to enact special tax exemptio ns and credits that pick winners and losers through the tax code and shift a greater proportion of the tax burde n to the majority of Missourians unable to utilize such lo opholes. No t a pe nny of the special bre aks in this bill or in the others that I am vetoing today1 was taken into account in the Fiscal Year 2015 budg et passed by the General Assembly , leaving it significantly out of balance and requiring swift actio n to protect the state's fiscal w ell-being. This is fiscally irresponsible and canno t receive my suppo rt. In enacting Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 584 and its brethren in the final hours of the legislativ e session, the General Assembly disregarded the normal legislativ e process, slipping in costly provisions without public hearings and without fiscal notes reflecting the impact on the state budg et. And just as legislators ignored the legislativ e process, so too did they disregard the budg et process by passing a budg et just a week earlie r that failed to account for this final day spending spree. Unlike the fiscal impact of Senate Subs titute No. 3 for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill Nos. 509 & 496, which today's lawmake rs have conveniently foisted off on future budgets for educatio n, public safety and other vital public services, the fiscal impact of the special breaks I am vetoing today would begin impacting budgets in the fiscal year starting in less than 30 days.

While the General Assembly may have abdicate d its fiscal responsibilitie s in failing to account for this budgetary impact, the resulting imbalance canno t be ignored and will have to be corrected through dramatic s pending reductio ns. Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 584 and the other measures I am vetoing today would add to the more than 260 sales tax exemptio ns and tax credits that litter Missouri's tax code without requiring the creation of a single new job. The continue d erosion of the tax base through such indiv idualize d exemptio ns and credits violates well-establis hed principle s of sound tax policy calling for a broad tax base so that tax rates can re main lo w. The General As sembly has ignored repeated calls to reduce these costly and inefficie nt carve-outs and has instead rushed through many more, leaving Missouri familie s to pick up the tab for educatio n and other vital public services. The unabate d growth of such special carve-outs and the fiscal irresponsibility of failing to budg et for them are all the more troubling when the General Assembly is simultane ously seeking to raise taxes on all Missourians with what could be the largest tax hike in Missouri history. While the benefits of the more than o ne billio n dollars in annual tax breaks passed by the legislature over the past two months will go disproportionately to the wealthy , the burde n of this multi-billio n dollar tax incre ase for trans portatio n would fall dis proportionately on Mis souri's working familie s and s eniors. The special breaks in Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 584 and the other bills that I am vetoing today are not the mere clarificatio ns that their suppo rters claim. Instead, they seek to overrule no fewer than twenty Missouri Supre me Court decisions going back to 1977 that have been followed by the departme nt of revenue over the course of pre vious and curre nt adminis tratio ns. In nearly every one of the cases sought to be overturne d, the court ruled that the law enacted by the General Assembly require d a tax to be collected, notwithstanding that a particular business had hoped to be excused from the legal obligations we all share . While it is well with in the rights of a losing litigant to petition their elected representativ es, it is wholly disingenuous to call doing so here anything other than what it is\u2014seeking a special exemptio n from the law, as curre ntly written and as confirme d by the courts. Thro ughout my time as Governor, I have worked with legislators on fiscally responsible ways to impro ve our tax code while protecting our state's fiscal health, including the four tax cuts that I have signed into law. Even during this legislative session, I worked directly with legislators to put forward a specific, concrete proposal that would have lowered taxes for Missourians and reined in costly and inefficie nt tax credits for special interests, broadened the overall tax base and reduce d tax rates, while protecting our ability to invest in educatio n and other vital public services. Unfo rtunate ly, the General Assembly refused to enact this broad tax relief in favor of narro w giveaways like those containe d in Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 584 and the other bills I am vetoing today. For the reasons stated herein, this is an e ndeavor I canno t suppo rt. Special Exemptions for the Storage and Proces sing of Data in Any Form Conference Committe e Substitute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 584 would exempt from state and local sales tax electrical energy, machine ry, equipme nt, parts and mate rials used or consumed in connection with or to facilitate the storage or processing of data in any form in a facility or a part of a facility . These exceedingly broad and comple tely new state and local sales tax exemptio ns are not the thoroughly vetted, widely-suppo rted, revenue-neutral incentive for new and expanding data centers that has been intro duce d in the General As sembly for the past several y ears. Altho ugh this provision is projected to reduce state and local revenue s by an estimate d $300 millio n1870 Journal o f the Senate annually , because it was slippe d into the bill in the final hours of the legislativ e session without a public hearing and without a fiscal note reflecting its cost, it is unlike ly legislators were aware of this significant fiscal impact when they voted to enact it. And as with the other new exemptio ns enacte d in Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 584 and the other bills I am vetoing today, the General Assembly failed to account for the resulting reductio n in state revenue in the budg et they enacte d for the fiscal year starting July 1, necessitating spending cuts in order to maintain a balance d a budg et. These new exemptio ns in Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 584 have been characte rized by some as apply ing only to \"data centers.\" However, such is not the case. The legislation itself does not use the term \"data center.\" Instead, the language is far broader, apply ing to \"any facility or part of a facility that is used primarily for such data storage or processing,\" which means that any business with a compute r could attempt to claim these broad new exemptio ns. The term \"data storage\" is unde fined, and the term \"processing\" is broadly defined to encompas s \"any actio n or process performed upon or using data in any form.\" As this definitio n indicate s, it is not merely electronic or other forms of \"high tech\" data that would be subject to these new exemptio ns, but rathe r data \"in any form,\" w hether stored in a co mpute r or in a file cabine t. This broad subsidy stands in stark contras t to legislation that I have suppo rted in the past to provide a revenue-neutral incentive for new and expanding data centers that create new jobs and make new capital investments.3 Such legislation has been intro duce d in the Missouri General Assembly for the past several years and has been thoroughly debated and vetted through the legislative process. See, e.g. Senate Bill No. 8 (1st Ex. Session 2011); Senate Bill No. 584 (2012); House Bill No. 1311 (2012); Senate Bill No. 46 (2013); Senate Bill No. 394 (2013); House Bill No. 222 (2013); Senate Bill No. 633 (2014); Senate Bill No . 1502 (2014). Inde ed, during the past legislativ e session the re was a public he aring on House Bill No. 1444 (2014), which would have enacte d this fiscally responsible data center incentive. Unfo rtunate ly, that is not what was inserted into Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 584 in the final hours of the legislativ e session. Inserted instead was a broad governme nt subsidy without any of the taxpayer protections present in previous legislation and without any require ment to create even a single new job. Specifically, previous data center legislation containe d the following protections, none of which is present he re: !Job creation - Required a minimum numbe r of jobs paying at least the county average wage to be created in o rder for a ne w or expanding data ce nter to obtain the exemptio n; !Capital inves tment - Require d a minimum amo unt o f new capital investment in order for a new or expanding data ce nter to obtain the exemptio n; !Revenue neutral - Limite d the amount o f the sales tax exemptio n to the amount that would result in a positive general revenue return to the state, thereby ensuring that the exemptio n would be revenue neutral; !New and expanding data centers only - Limite d the availability of the sales tax exemptio n to solely new or expanding data centers, as defined by NAICS classificatio n, to provide an incentive for such facilitie s to locate or expand in Missouri, not merely a subsidy for all facilitie s, regardle ss of whether the y are alre ady operating in Mis souri; and 3 Even witho ut a specific data center incentive , Misso uri has been successful in recruiting and growing such operations in the state . For example, in April I was pleased to announce the opening of a mission critical data center for a premier cloud computing company in the unde rground busine ss complex in Northeast Kansas City owned and operated by Hunt Midwe st, whic h will result in the creation of 21 new jobs and $58 million in new capital investment. With the continue d growth of high-te ch companie s like these, it is no wonder that Misso uri was the faste st-gr owing state for technology emplo yment in 2013, even witho ut a dedicated data center incentive .1871 Supplement !Rigorous overs ight - Previous data center legislation require d rando m audits of recipie nts to ensure that the recipie nt was actually eligible for the exemptio n. In addition to failing to include any of the above taxpayer protections found in previous data center legislation, these broad new exemptio ns would play favorites with the tax code by providing more generous tax benefits for data storage and processing than is curre ntly available to numerous other types of businesses. First, while the curre nt sales tax exemptio ns for manufacture rs in Section 144.054, RSMo , only apply to state sales taxes, this bill would exempt the same type of purchas es for data storage and processing activ ities from local sales taxes as well. Second, while the curre nt manufacturing sales tax exemptio ns require the tax-exempt items to be actually used in the manufacturing process, these new exemptio ns for data storage and processing would apply even if the items are used simply \"in connection with\" or \"to facilitate \" the storage and processing of data. This could result in purchas es only very loosely connected, if at all, to the actual storage and processing of data being claime d as tax-exempt. Offering these broad new exemptio ns from state and lo cal tax would tre at tho se who manipulate data better than those who manufacture goods, without a clearly articulate d economic justificatio n for doing so, without requiring the creation of a single new job, and without accounting for the impact on state and local budg ets. Acco rding ly, this provision does not receive my suppo rt. Special Exemption for Power C ompanies Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 584 w ould als o provide a special carve-out from state and local taxes for purchas es of a variety of items used in the generatio n, trans mission, distributio n, sale or furnis hing of electricity by power companie s. This provision is written so broadly that these entitie s could avoid paying any sales and use tax whatsoever, altho ugh there is nothing in the bill that would require them to create any new jobs or to pass the savings along to consumers in the form of reduce d electricity rates. These new exemptio ns would abrogate a 2001 Missouri Supre me Court case, which held that the law enacte d by the General Assembly did not autho rize such tax exemptio ns for power companie s. See Utilicorp United, Inc. v. Directo r of Revenue, 75 S.W.3d 725 (Mo. banc 2001) (machine ry and equipme nt used in trans mission of electricity not exempt unde r Section 144.030, RSMo ). Like other tailor-made exemptio ns in Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committee Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 584, these new tax exemptio ns for power companie s were inserted during the final hours of the legislativ e session without a public hearing in any Senate committe e. Altho ugh not include d in any fiscal note for Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 584, this provision could reduce state revenue by more than $30 millio n annually , none of which was accounte d for by the legislature in the budg et the y enacte d just a w eek earlie r. Furthe rmore, there is nothing in this provision to prevent the power companie s from claiming exemptio ns from local sales taxes on top of their exemptio ns from state taxes, which would result in an additio nal $30 million annual impact to local revenues. Following its passage, proponents have suggested a narro w interpretatio n4 of the provision to apply only to state taxes because the language is silent as to whether local taxes are also exempte d. However, in order to exempt state sales tax and not also exempt the local tax, the legislature must expressly make the exemptio n inapplicable to local sales tax, as it did in the only curre nt exemptio n from the state sales taxes that does not also apply to the local sales tax. See Section 155.054.2, RSMo (\"The exemptio ns grante d in this subsection shall not apply to local sales taxes as defined in section 32.085 . . .\"). It is necessary to expressly exclude the local sales tax 4 There is some irony in urging a narrow interpretatio n of the new exemptions provided by this bill when in the Misso uri Supr eme Court case sought to be abrogated the power company argued for an expansive interpretation of the tax exemptions at issue . See Utilicorp Unit ed, Inc., 75 S.W.3d at 725-30.1872 Journal o f the Senate because Section 32.087, RSMo , incorporates all state sales tax exemptio ns to the local sales tax.5 The General Assembly ackno wledged this in Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for House Bill No. 1865, which I am also vetoing today, and which sought to provide state-only tax exemptio ns for certain purchas es by fast food restaurants , convenience stores, and grocery stores, by expressly stating that the exemptio ns do not apply to the local sales tax. See Section 144.055.3 (\"The exemptio ns grante d in this section shall no t apply to the local sales tax law as defined in s ection 32.085\"). Mere silence as to whether a state sales tax exemptio n applie s to the local sales tax is insufficie nt to exempt local taxes, as indicate d by other state and local sales tax exemptio ns that only expressly reference an e xemptio n from the state tax. See, e.g., Section 144.030.1, RSMo ; Section 144.062, RSMo . Acco rding ly, there is nothing in the bill to prevent the power companie s from one day seeking a refund of local taxes paid after the effective date of the law, significantly impacting the budg ets of local co mmunitie s. Special Exemptions for C ertain Recreation Activities Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 584 contains a provision that its proponents contend w ould s imply clarify the curre nt sales tax on fitne ss activ ities. Instead, this provision seeks to overturn more than a dozen Missouri Supre me Court cases going back to 1977 followed by the departme nt of revenue over the course of previous and curre nt adminis tratio ns by fundame ntally trans curre sales tax on \"amus ement, entertainme nt, and recreation\" into a tax solely on ticke ts and fees for admis sion.6 Such a dramatic chang e in the law would make far 5 Section 32.087.8, RSMo , provides: \"All exemptions granted to agencies of government, organizatio ns, persons and to the sale of certain articles and items of tangible personal property and taxable services unde r the provisio ns of sections 144.010 to 144.525, as these sections now read and as they may hereafter be amended, it being the intent of this general assembly to ensur e that the same sales tax exemptions granted from the state sales tax law also be granted unde r the local sales tax law, are hereby made applic able to the imposition and collection of all local sales taxes imposed unde r the local sales tax law.\" See also President Casino, Inc. v. Director of Revenue, 219 S.W.3d 235, 241-42 (mo.banc 2007)(highlighting Section 32.087.8 as an example of where, \"[t]he legislature has specifically and directly incorporated sales tax exemptions into a number of other tax statutes. . .\"). Notably the 97th General Assembly reenacted Section 32.087.8 last year in Senate Bill 99 (2013), Senate Bill 23 (2013), and House Bill 184 (2013), and each time continued the reference to all state sales tax exemptions applying equally to the local tax. 6 The cases abrogated or calle d into question by this provisio n include: Michael Jaude s Fitness Edge , Inc. v. Director of Revenue, 248 S.W.3d 606 (Mo. banc 2008) (fees paid for personal training subje ct to tax as fees paid in or to a place of amusement); Surrey's on the Plaza, Inc. v. Director of Revenue, 128 S.W.3d 508 (Mo. banc 2004) (operation of horse-drawn carriage tours was place of amusement for sales tax purposes); Eight y Hundr ed Clayton Corp. v.

Spradling , 551 S.W.2d 596 (Mo. banc 1977) (commercial bowling establishm ent is a place of amusement for sales tax purposes).1873 Supplement more than just gym memberships and yoga classes tax free. It would also exempt fees paid at bowling alleys, golf courses, pool halls , country clubs, and arcade s, as well as encourag ing any business that curre ntly charg es an admis sion fee to convert it into a newly tax-exempt fee for a specific activ ity. Enacting this sweeping new exemptio n would furthe r erode the tax base without requiring the creation of even a single new job, in additio n to reducing state and local revenue for educatio n, public safety and other vital public services by more than $70 millio n annually . The Fiscal Year 2015 budg et passed by the General Assembly fails to account for the cost of these new carve-outs, putting the budg et out of balance and ne cessitating spending reductio ns in order to balance it. Tax Refunds to Delinquent Taxpayers Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 584 would modify the establis hed process for obtaining a sales tax refund by allowing a refund even if a taxpayer curre ntly has overdue taxes. This provision is projected to reduce state and local revenue by up to $10 millio n annually , altho ugh the General Assembly failed to account for any of this fiscal impact in the Fiscal Year 2015 budg et they passed. As with many of the tax measures passed by the legislature on the last day of session, this provision was not the subject of a public he aring in any Senate committe e. This provision would enable a business with significant tax delinque ncies to get a tax refund for an unre lated overpay ment of tax, where unde r curre nt law the refund could be offset by the amount of tax delinque ncy. For example , unde r this provision even a business that owes $100,000 in back taxes would be able to get a refund check from the state for a $100,000 uninte ntional overpay ment, so long as the $100,000 tax delinque ncy is subject to appe al. Unde r curre nt law, the $100,000 refund would be offset by the entire $100,000 tax delinque ncy, thereby eliminating the need to later engage in costly and inefficie nt collection efforts to recover the $100,000 in overdue taxes. Such a chang e to the establis hed refund process would unfairly reward those who fail to pay their taxes and would result in costly inefficie ncies borne by all law-abiding taxpayers. Acco rding ly, this provision does not receive my suppo rt. Corporate Income Allocation Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 584 would enable additio nal businesses to reduce their corporate income taxes by utiliz ing an alternativ e method of calculating the amount of their income that is derived in Missouri. Legislation enacted last year autho rized this alternativ e allocatio n method for manufacture rs and other businesses selling tang ible personal property. This provision would expand this alternativ e method to sellers of intang ible personal property and service providers such as law firms , accounting firms , stock brokers, bond trade rs, real estate holding companie s, and co nsultants . Like many of the tax measures enacte d during the final ho urs of the legislativ e session, this provision was never the subject of a public hearing and was not accounte d for in the Fiscal Year 2015 budget passed by the General Assembly . A chang e to Missouri's tax policy that would reduce state revenues by up to $15 millio n annually according to the legislature 's own estimate should be the subject of open debate, and the foregone revenue must be accounte d for in the budg et in order to receive my suppo rt. Proving Eligibility for Tax Exemptions Not only would Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 584 create broad new tax exemptio ns, it would also excuse a business trying to claim these or any of the other 200 sales tax exemptio ns in curre nt law from having to prove that it is actually eligible for the claime d exemptio n. 1874 Journal o f the Senate While I suppo rt eliminating the arbitrary limitatio n in curre nt law that puts the burde n of proof on some businesses but not others in determining tax liability , when it co mes to someone trying to claim a tax exemptio n, they should at a minimum be require d to show that they are entitle d to it. Claiming a special carve-out or loophole without evidence to suppo rt it is unfair to the vast majority of Missouri taxpayers who lack the influe nce to get special tax exemptio ns crafte d for them by the General Assembly . With the help of the legislature and the best accounting and legal advice, those fortunate enough to take advantag e of special exemptio ns would now be given every incentive to push the outer boundarie s of any exemptio ns that could conceivably apply , furthe r eroding the tax base and shifting an even greater tax burde n to the majority of taxpayers. Not content with merely showering the fortunate with a cavalcade of new tax breaks, the General Assembly has gone furthe r to stack the deck in their favor by providing an adde d incentive to try on an exemptio n just to see if it fits. This is not a tax policy that I can suppo rt. In accordance with the above-stated reasons for disappro val, I am returning Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 584 w ithout my appro val. Since rely, /s / Jeremiah W .

I disappro ve of Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 593. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 593 would autho rize municipalitie s with 1,000 or fewer residents to cance l an election if the numbe r of candidate s that initially filed for office is equal to the numbe r of vacancie s to be filled for the office. To take advantag e of this autho rity, the municipality 's voters must appro ve a ballot measure and then renew the autho rity by a public v ote every six years. Like legislation I have vetoed in the past, Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 593 would limit the rights of Missouri citize ns to suppo rt write -in candidate s and therefore does not receive my appro val. The previously-vetoed Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 282 (2011) containe d a provision cance lling elections in municipalitie s with populatio ns of less than 35,000, which would have affected more than 900 Missouri municipalitie s. My veto message pointed out that cance lling an election when the numbe r of candidate s is equal to the numbe r of available positions would preclude citize ns from electing a candid ate through the write-in process, which is particularly impo rtant when voters learn something negative about the declare d candidate after the deadline for filing but be fore the election.1875 Supplement Altho ugh somewhat impro ved by virtue of the public vote to autho rize and reautho rize the option to cance l elections, Senate Substitute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 593 contains the same infirmity presented by Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 282 (2011) w ith re spect to write-in candidate s. Write-in candidate s do not hav e to file until the Wednesday before the electio n, but they would no longer be able to do so in the more than 650 Missouri municipalitie s affected by this bill, even if negative informatio n about the unopposed candidate came to light prior to the election but after regular candidate filing had closed. Moreover, the small municipalitie s covered by this provision are precisely the communitie s in which write-in candidate s are the most likely to succeed. Because I suppo rt the rights of citize ns to elect write-in candidate s I do not suppo rt this bill.

This bill will become law because while it no longer require s a person who solicits memberships on behalf of a pre- paid legal services plan to be licensed as an insurance agent, it will strengthen the regulatio n of such indiv iduals by subjecting them to civil and criminal enforcement by the Missouri Attorney General purs uant to the Missouri Me rchandis ing Practice s Act. During the legislative process, concerns were expressed that House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 606 would eliminate state oversight of indiv iduals selling pre-paid legal service plans and put consumers at risk. However, while House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 606 does eliminate the require ment to be licensed as an insurance agent, other consumer protections will now apply to ensure Missouri consumers receive the services they are sold. Unde r the Missouri Merchandis ing Practice s Act, the Attorney General's Office and local prosecutors will be able to take action against indiv iduals and companie s who use false or deceptive practice s when they solicit these memberships, and an indiv idual harme d by such can bring a civil action. In additio n, House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 606 does nothing to chang e the fact that companie s selling casualty insurance to cover potential future legal expenses must continue to be licensed and will still be regulate d by the Departme nt of Insurance , Financial Institutio ns and Professional Registratio n. With confide nce in the ability of the Attorney General to take actio n to protect consumers and the autho rity of the Departme nt of Insurance , Financial Institutio ns and Professional Registratio n to continue to oversee insurance companie s, I can appro ve this legislation. In accordance with the above stated reasons for appro val, I am returning House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill 606 w ith my appro val. Respectfully submitte d, /s / Jeremiah W .

My reasons for disappro val are as follows: Conference Committee Substitute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 612 would continue a damag ing trend by the General Assembly to enact special tax exemptio ns and credits that pick winners and losers through the tax code and shift a greater proportion of the tax burde n to the majority of Missourians unable to utilize such lo opholes. Not a pe nny of the special breaks in this bill or in the others that I am vetoing today1 was taken into account in the Fiscal Year 2015 budg et passed by the General Assembly , leaving it significantly out of balance and requiring swift actio n to protect the State 's fiscal w ell-be ing. This is fiscally irresponsible and canno t receive my suppo rt. In enacting and its brethren in the final hours of the legislativ e session, the General Assembly disregarded the normal legislativ e process, slipping in costly provisions witho ut public hearing s and without fiscal notes reflecting the impact on the state budg et. And just as legislators ignored the legislativ e process, so too did they disregard the budg et process by passing a budg et just a week earlier that failed to account for this final day spending spree. Unlike the fiscal impact of Senate Subs titute No. 3 for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill Nos. 509 & 496, which today's lawmake rs have conveniently foisted off on future budg ets for educatio n, public safety and other vital public services, the fiscal impact of the special breaks I am vetoing today would begin impacting budg ets in the fiscal year starting in le ss than 30 days. There are no delays, triggers, or other gimmicks that co uld be touted as shielding educatio n, public safety, and other vital public services, at both the state and local level,2 from the projected nearly $776 millio n in state and local revenue legislators voted to send to narro w special interests on the last day of session. While the General Assembly may have abdicate d its fiscal responsibilitie s in failing to account for this budg etary impact, the resulting imbalance canno t be ignored and w ill hav e to be corrected thro ugh dramatic s pending reductio ns. 1 Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 584; Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 662; Conference Committee Substitute No. 2 for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 693; House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 727; Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 829; Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Substitute for Senate Bill No. 860; Senate Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1296; House Bill No. 1455; and Senate Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1865. 2 In additio n to impacting the general local sales tax imposed unde r Section 32.085, exemptio ns from local sales tax would reduce revenue collected through num erous voter-appr oved local sales taxes that are targeted to specific, community suppo rted needs.

The continue d erosion of the tax base through such indiv idualize d exemptio ns and credits violates well-establis hed principle s of sound tax policy calling for a bro ad tax base so that tax rate s can remain low. The General Assembly has ignored repeated calls to reduce these costly and inefficie nt carve-outs and has instead rushed through many more, leaving Missouri familie s to pick up the tab for educatio n and vital public services. The unabate d growth of such special carve-outs and the fiscal irresponsibility of failing to budg et for them are all the more troubling when the General Assembly is simultane ously seeking to raise taxes on all Missourians with what could be the largest tax hike in Missouri history. While the benefits of the more than o ne billio n dollars in annual tax breaks passed by the legislature over the past two months will go disproportionately to the wealthy , the burde n of this multi-billio n dollar tax incre ase for trans portatio n would fall dis proportionately on Mis souri's working familie s and s eniors. The special breaks in Conference Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 612 and the other bills that I am vetoing today are not the mere clarificatio ns that their suppo rters claim. Ins tead, the y seek to overrule no fewer than twenty Missouri Supre me Court cas es going back to 1977 that have been followed by the departme nt of revenue over the course of previous and curre nt adminis tratio ns. In nearly every one of the cases sought to be overturne d, the court ruled that the law enacte d by the General Assembly require d a tax to be collected, notwithstanding that a particular businesses had hoped to be excused from the legal obligations we all share . While it is well within the rights of a losing litigant to petition their elected representativ es, it is wholly disingenuous to call doing so here anything other than what it is\u2014seeking a special exemptio n from the law, as curre ntly written and as confirme d by the courts. Thro ughout my time as Governor, I have worked with legislators on fiscally responsible ways to impro ve our tax code while protecting our state's fiscal health, including the four tax cuts that I have signed into law. Even during this legislative session, I worked directly with legislators to put forward a specific, concrete proposal that would have lowered taxes for Missourians and reined in costly and inefficie nt tax credits for special interests, broadened the overall tax base and reduce d tax rates, while protecting our ability to invest in educatio n and other vital public services. Unfo rtunate ly, the General Assembly refused to enact this broad tax relief in favor of narro w giveaways like those contain ed in Conference Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 612 and the other bills I am vetoing today. For the reasons stated herein, this is an e ndeavor I canno t suppo rt. Windfall Refunds and Retroactive Immunity Conference Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 612 would mandate governme ntal notificatio n before a business is unde r any legal obligation to collect and remit sales tax unde r an adminis trativ e or judicial decision that modifies the items subject to tax. See Section 144.021.2. This ambig uously-worded provision is projected to reduce state and local revenues by up to $200 millio n annually .3 As with the various other tax measures the General Assembly rushed through on the last day of session, the Fiscal Year 2015 budg et they enacte d fails to account for any of the revenue reductio ns that w ould re sult fro m this provision. 3 A signific ant portion of the fiscal impac t from this provisio n is due to its failur e to prohibit a busine ss that was properly collecting tax from claim ing a refund for the taxes it paid prior to receiving the notification called for unde r the bill. Conference Committe e Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 662, whic h I am also vetoing today, contains a similar provisio n but includes language that expressly prohibits refunds for busine sses that had been correctly collecting the tax, thereby reducing its projected fiscal impact.1880 Journal o f the Senate Mandato ry governme ntal notification before a law applie s would turn on its head the long-standing principle of our democracy that indiv iduals are presumed to know the law. It is one thing to require the governme nt to provide information about recent developments in the law so that those affected can adjust their prospective conduct according ly, but it is quite another to conditio n whether that law even applie s based upon whether a person has received personal notificatio n of the law's existence. This kind of governme ntal paternalis m is unpre cedented. This year alone the General Assembly passed nearly 200 bills modifying thousands of pages of Missouri law that apply to all manne r of conduct. The General Assembly should not have to send a letter to every Missourian before this legion of new laws takes effect. Similarly , every potential criminal should not have to receive a notice describing this year's revisions to the state's criminal co de before they can be prosecuted unde r it. This provision in Conference Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 612 also misunde rstands tax law. Altho ugh a decision of the director of revenue is listed as an example of a \"modificatio n\" triggering the duty to notify establis hed by the bill, the director has no power to finally determine whether an item is taxable or not; that autho rity lies solely with those who write the tax laws\u2014the General Assembly \u2014and those that finally interpret them\u2014the Missouri Supre me Court. See Mo. Const. Art. V, Se c. 3 (g iving the Missouri Supre me Court exclusive appe llate jurisdictio n over the constructio n of the revenue laws of this state). Similarly , a decision of the adminis trativ e hearing commis sion is listed as something that can trigger notificatio n. However, while the adminis trativ e hearing commis sion has the power to hear indiv idual disputes, a decision of that body is not binding beyond the parties, and therefore it canno t finally \"modify\" what is taxable or not for other affected sellers. Altho ugh a de cision of the Missouri Supre me Court mig ht \"chang e[ ] which ite ms of tang ible personal property or services are taxable\" within the meaning of the bill, the court decisions that purpo rtedly prompted this provision and many of the new exemptio ns passed on the final day of the legislativ e session did not. In each of those cases, the Missouri Supre me Court found that the current law, as enacte d by the General Assembly , require d a tax to be paid, notwithstanding that a particular business had tried to get out of this legal obligation.4 The decisions did not newly subject an item to tax; instead, they simply confirme d that s uch ite ms were and are taxable. Ho wever, there is nothing in this bill to prevent a business from arguing that court decisions like these are \"modificatio ns\" triggering a notificatio n to all affected sellers that what was always taxable continue s to be taxable as confirme d by the Missouri Supre me Court. The bill provides far-re aching consequences for such a notificatio n. Unde r the bill, a failure to notify an affected seller \"shall relieve such seller of liability for taxes that would be due unde r the modificatio n.\" See Section 144.021.2. Acco rding ly, receiving a no tificatio n gives any business that was not collecting taxes prior to the notice retroactiv e immunity for taxes that the Missouri Supre me Court has confirme d should have been collected. Unde r this bill, even the specific business that had sought to avoid paying 4 This is true whether it was the court reaffirming this year the tax a laundr y first sought to avoid in 1989, see AAA Laundr y & Linen Supply Co. v. Director of Revenue, 425 S.W.3d 126, 127 (Mo. banc 2014) (disc ussing Unitog Rental Services, Inc. v. Director of Revenue, 779 S.W.2d 568 (Mo. banc 1989)), affirming that the General Asse mbly' s laws did not exempt the purchase s claim ed as tax free by convenience stores, restaur ants, or grocery stores, see Aquila Foreign Qualific ations Corp. v. Director of Revenue, 362 S.W.3d 1, 2 (Mo. banc 2012); Brinker Missouri, Inc. v. Director of Revenue, 319 S.W.3d 433, 435 (Mo. banc 2010); Union Elec. Co. v. Director of Revenue, 425 S.W.3d 118, 120 (Mo. banc 2014), or clarifying in 2008 that \"tax is due for 'fees paid to, or in any place of amusement, entertainm ent or recreation,\" see Michael Jaude s Fitness Edge, Inc. v. Director of Revenue, 248 S.W.3d 606 (Mo. banc 2008) (affir ming denial of refund claim for taxes paid at fitne ss center base d on Wilson's Total Fitness Center, Inc. v. Director of Revenue, 38 S.W.3d 424 (Mo. banc 2001)).1881 Supplement taxes, hired a lawyer to litigate the issue, and lost in court, could argue that it had no tax liability for any of the taxes the court o rdered it to pay prio r to being notified of the decision in its own cas e. Even more problematic than retroactive immunity for businesses that had not been collecting and remitting the taxes require d by the law would be the windfall for businesses that had been correctly collecting the taxes required prior to the court decision confirming their oblig ation to do so. Conference Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 612 would waive any tax liability prior to receiving the require d notificatio n and, unlike a similar provision in Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 662, it does not expressly preclude a business that had been properly collecting the tax from this waiver of tax liability . Acco rding ly, there is nothing in this bill preventing a business that was properly collecting the tax from claiming a refund for the taxes it correctly collected prior to being notified of a Missouri Supre me Court decision confirming that the tax it had been correctly collecting was required unde r the law. Unde r this provision, the vast majority of businesses properly collecting tax could seek a windfall refund simply because a particular bus iness had s ought to avoid its legal obligation, litig ated, and lo st. The problems with this provision extend beyond windfall refunds and retroactive immunity, to the additio nal governme ntal intrus ion and burde n on taxpayers that could result from the require ment to provide a personal notificatio n to each and every affected seller. Such indiv idualize d notificatio n would require the departme nt of revenue to more closely and more frequently scrutinize sales data and other business informatio n it obtains and to potentially require additio nal informatio n in order to determine precisely which businesses might be affected by a given decision. In additio n, because addre sses, ownership and personal contact informatio n chang e over time, the departme nt would need to gather update d informatio n more frequently and perhaps maintain a compre hensive databas e of such informatio n to ensure cost-effective compliance with the personalize d notificatio n requirement of the bill. The need to continually maintain up-to -date sales and other business informatio n would result in additional burde ns for taxpayers that could be avoided with a less onerous, and likely more effective, method of pro viding generalize d notice of update s in the law than the personal no tificatio n mandate d by Conference Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 612. If it were to become law, Conference Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 612 would create no shortage of work for tax attorneys and consultants . It provides a clear incentive for businesses to engage in otherwise unne cessary litigation in the hopes of obtaining a \"decision\" arguably constituting a \"modificatio n\" in order to trigger indiv idual notification and then either a windfall refund if they were comply ing with the law or retroactiv e immunity if they were violating it. Moreover, it will require all taxpayers to bear the cost of staffing and postage to comply with the personal notificatio n mandate , while putting additio nal burde ns on businesses through additio nal governme nt intrus ion into their affairs . While providing up-to -date informatio n to taxpayers is a laudable policy, Conference Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 612 fails to accomplis h it and instead puts additio nal burde n on taxpayers and significantly reduce s state and lo cal re venue. Acco rding ly, this measure does not receive my suppo rt. Special Exemptions for C ommercial Laundries and Dry C leaners Conference Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 612 would exempt comme rcial laundrie s and dry cleaners from paying state and local sales and use taxes on their purchases of mate rials, goods, machine ry, electrical energy and gas, chemicals , soaps, detergents, cleaning and s anitizing agents, and o ther ing redients used to treat, cle an and sanitize textiles. These new tax exemptio ns would only be available for large comme rcial and indus trial laundrie s and dry cleaners\u2014facilitie s that process at least 500 pounds per hour and 60,000 pounds per week. There is no requirement that a benefitting business create any new jobs to take advantag e of these broad new exemptio ns. Moreover, the General Assembly failed to account for the projected $2 millio n annual1882 Journal o f the Senate reductio n in state revenue in the budg et they enacte d for the fiscal y ear starting July 1, as well as an additio nal $2 millio n reductio n pro jected for local jurisdictio ns. Like many of the exemptio ns and carv e-outs rushed thro ugh on the last day of the legislativ e session, these new exemptio ns for laundrie s and dry cleaners are not mere clarificatio ns of existing sales and use tax law. Instead, this provision would seek to overrule 25 years of legal precedent holding that cleaning dirty clothes is not the same as manufacturing . In 1989, the Missouri Supre me Court first \"plumbe d the sudsy depths of vario us sales and use tax exemptio ns and found no applicatio n to comme rcial laundry operatio ns.\" AAA Laundry & Linen Supply Co. v. D irecto r of Revenue , 425 S.W .3d 126, 127 (Mo . banc 2014) (discussing Unito g Rental Services, Inc. v. Directo r of Revenue , 779 S.W.2d 568 (Mo. banc 1989)). Earlie r this year, the court similarly rejected a comme rcial laundry 's attempt to avoid paying its taxes, reiterating that, as in 1989, the laws enacte d by the General Assembly did not provide a tax exemptio n. Id. at 127-29. Following this decision, the laundry league lobbied lawmake rs for tailor-made exemptio ns that would treat ironing out the wrinkle s as \"processing\" a shirt and getting out the grass stains as \"manufacturing \" a pair of pants , thereby abrogating a quarte r century of law and relieving the laundrie s of the ir pre vious legal obligations. Because these new exemptio ns were enacte d without regard for the normal legislativ e process\u2014slippe d into the bill without ever being in an intro duce d bill, without ever being the subject of a public hearing , and without ever being include d in a fiscal note that reflected their cost\u2014it is not surpris ing that they promote poor tax policy. First, these exemptio ns draw a seeming ly arbitrary distinctio n between the laundrie s and dry cleaners fortunate enough to gain this generous new benefit and the rest who are left out to dry. Unde r this provision, a laundry that processes 59,999 pounds per week would have to continue paying their taxes, but a laundry processing a single pound more would be entitle d to broad new exemptio ns from state and local taxes. This distorts the free marke t and puts smalle r laundrie s and dry cleaners (not to mention the Missouri familie s who are doing their own laundry ) in the position of subsidizing the operatio ns of the larger ones. The large comme rcial laundrie s might be getting their detergent tax -free, but the rest of Mis souri tax payers would be getting taken to the cleaners. Moreover, this provision does not simply give comme rcial laundrie s and dry cleaners the same tax exemptio ns enjoyed by other businesses. It gives them more lucrativ e ones. Altho ugh some of the tax exemptio ns available to manufacture rs are limite d solely to state taxes, these new exemptio ns for laundrie s would apply to local taxes as well. With this provision, the General Assembly would be privileging washing dirty clothes over manufacturing new products , giving comme rcial dry cleaners and laundries a better deal than Missouri manufacture rs without any clearly-articulate d economic justificatio n for doing so and without requiring the creation of a even a single new job. Particularly when coupled with the fiscal irresponsibility of failing to account for the fiscal impact in the budg et, these exemptio ns represent po or tax policy and po or fiscal po licy, and canno t receive my appro val. Corporate Income Allocation Conference Committe e Substitute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 612 would enable additio nal businesses to reduce their corporate income taxes by utilizing an alternativ e method of calculating the amount of their income that is derived in Missouri. Legislation enacte d last year autho rized this alternativ e allocatio n method for manufacture rs and other bus inesses selling tang ible personal property. This provision would expand this alternativ e method to sellers of intang ible personal property and service providers such as law firms , accounting firms , stock brokers, bond trade rs, real estate holding companie s, and co nsultants . Like many of the tax measures enacte d during the final hours of the legislativ e session, this provision was never the subject of a public hearing and was not accounte d for in the Fiscal Year 2015 budg et passed by the General Assembly . A chang e to Missouri's tax policy that would reduce state revenues by1883 Supplement up to $15 millio n annually according to the legislature 's own estimate should be the subject of open debate, and the foregone revenue must be accounte d for in the budg et in order to receive my suppo rt. In accordance with the above-stated reasons for disappro val, I am returning Conference Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 612 w ithout my appro val.

I disappro ve of Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 615. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 615 contains a number of worthw hile provisions that can become law with my actio n on other legislation. However, because this bill would reduce governme nt trans parency by exempting certain records of the Lieutenant Governor from disclosure unde r Chapte r 610, RSMo, commo nly known as the Missouri Suns hine Law, it does not receive my appro val. Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 615 would amend Chapte r 610, RSMo , to autho rize the closure of \"[i]ndiv idually identifiable records submitte d to the office of the Lieutenant Governor concerning or relating to reports of waste, fraud, and abus e of public resources.\" However, as noted by the State Audito r in his most recent audit of the Lieutenant Governor's Office, \"the Lieutenant Governor lacks the statuto ry autho rity to investigate public concerns1884 Journal o f the Senate regarding the suspected misuse of taxpayer monies or to create a website or telephone hotline for that purpo se.\"1 Moreover, the State Audito r recognized that \"because state law already provides other elected officials and agencies, such as the State Audito r, the Attorney General, the Departme nt of Social Services, and the Departme nt of Labor and Indus trial Relations, Division of Workers' Compensation, with autho rity to investigate fraud and misuse of public funds , the Lieutenant Governor's Missouri Waste Report may be a duplicatio n of effort and a w aste of state resources.\" Missouri law already provides confide ntiality protections for indiv iduals making reports or allegations of impro per governme ntal activ ity to agencies that actually have the statuto ry autho rity to investigate such allegations. For example, just last year I signed legislation authorizing the State Auditor to receive reports or allegations of improper governmental activities and allowing reporting individuals to choose to remain anonymous. See Section 29.221, RSMo. Although maintaining confidentiality may be warrante d where information is being provided to an agency with the legal authority to investigate the allegations, there is no sound reason for shielding from public scrutiny an office that lacks such authority. Accordingly, this bill does not receive my approval.

I have consistently opposed the arming of teache rs as a means to keep schools safe. It is simply the wrong appro ach, and one that I do not suppo rt. The safety of Missourians - especially childre n - has long been a top priority of mine , both as Governor and as the former chief law enforcement officer of our state. I have suppo rted, and will continue to suppo rt, the use of duly autho rized law enforcement officers emplo yed as school resource officers in schools. This bill, which would create a new mechanism for the arming of teache rs, would not make schools safer. Co nsequently, I am re turning it without my appro val.

(Jay ) Nix on Governor June 11, 2014 TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE O F THE STATE O F MISSO URI Herewith I return to you Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 662 e ntitle d: AN ACT To repeal sections 143.451, 144.021, and 144.080, RSMo , and to enact in lieu thereof four new sections relating to taxation, with e xisting penalty provisions. I disappro ve of Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 662. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 662 would continue a damag ing trend by the General Assembly to enact special tax exemptio ns and credits that pick winners and losers through the tax code and shift a greater proportion of the tax burde n to the majority of Mis sourians unable to utilize such loopholes. Not a penny of the special bre aks in this bill or in the others that I am vetoing today1 was taken into account in the Fiscal Year 2015 budg et passed by the General Assembly , leaving it significantly out of balance and requiring swift actio n to protect the State 's fiscal well-being. This is fiscally irresponsible and canno t receive my suppo rt. In enacting Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 662 and its brethren in the final hours of the legislativ e session, the General Assembly disregarded the normal legislativ e process, slipping in costly provisions without public hearing s and without fiscal notes reflecting the impact on the state budg et. And just as legislators ignored the legislativ e process, so too did they disregard the budg et process by passing a budg et just a week earlie r that failed to account for this final day spending spree. Unlike the fiscal impact of Senate Subs titute No. 3 for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill Nos. 509 & 496, which today's lawmake rs have conveniently foisted off on future budgets for educatio n, public safety and other vital public services, the fiscal impact of the special breaks I am vetoing today would begin impacting budg ets in the fiscal year starting in less than 30 days. 1 Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 584 Conference Committee Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 612; Conference Committee Substitute No. 2 for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 693; House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 727; Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 829; Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Substitute for Senate Bill No. 860; Senate Committe e Substitute for House Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1296; House Bill No. 1455; and Senate Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1865.1889 Supplement There are no delays, triggers, or other gimmicks that could be touted as shielding educatio n, public safety, and other vital public services, at both the state and local level,2 from the projected $776 millio n in state and local revenue legislators voted to send to narro w special interests on the last day of session. While the General Assembly may have abdicate d its fiscal responsibilitie s in failing to account for this budg etary impact, the resulting imbalance canno t be ignored and will have to be corrected through dramatic s pending reductio ns. Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 662 and the other measures I am vetoing today would add to the more than 260 sales tax exemptio ns and tax credits that litter Missouri's tax code without requiring the creation of a single new job. The continue d erosion of the tax base through such indiv idualize d exemptio ns and credits violates well-establis hed principle s of sound tax policy calling for a bro ad tax base so that tax rates can remain low. The General As sembly has ignored repeated calls to reduce these costly and inefficie nt carve-outs and has instead rushed through many more, leaving Missouri familie s to pick up the tab for educatio n and vital public services. The unabated growth of such special carve-outs and the fiscal irresponsibility of failing to budget for them are all the more troubling when the General Assembly is simultaneously seeking to raise taxes on all Missourians with what could be the largest tax hike in Missouri history. While the benefits of the more than one billion dollars in annual tax breaks passed by the legislature over the past two months will go disproportionately to the wealthy, the burden of this multi-billion dollar tax increase for transportation would fall disproportionately on Missouri's working families and seniors. The special breaks in Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 662 and the other bills that I am vetoing today are not the mere clarifications that their supporters claim. Instead, they seek to overrule no fewer than twenty Missouri Supreme Court decisions going back to 1977 that have been followed by the departme nt of revenue over the course previous and curre nt adminis tratio ns. In nearly every one of the cases sought to be overturne d, the court ruled that the law enacte d by the General Assembly require d a tax to be collected, notwithstanding that a particular businesses had hoped to be excused from the legal obligations we all share . While it is well within the rights of a losing litigant to petition their elected representativ es, it is wholly disingenuous to call doing so here anything other than what it is\u2014seeking a special exemptio n from the law, as curre ntly written and as confirme d by the courts. 2 In additio n to impacting the general local sales tax imposed unde r Section 32.085, exemptio ns from local sales tax would reduce revenue collected through num erous voter-appr oved local sales taxes that are targeted to specific, community suppo rted needs.

Even during this legislative session, I worked directly with legislators to put forward a specific, concrete proposal that would have lowered taxes for Missourians and reined in costly and inefficie nt tax credits for special interests, broadened the overall tax base and reduce d tax rates, while protecting our ability to invest in educatio n and other vital public services. Unfortunately, the General Assembly refused to enact this broad tax relief in favor of narro w giveaways like those containe d in Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 662 and the other bills I am vetoing today. For the reasons stated herein, this is an e ndeavor I canno t suppo rt. Retroactive Immunity Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 662 would mandate governme ntal notificatio n before a business is unde r any legal obligation to collect and remit sales tax unde r an adminis trativ e or judicial decision that modifies the items subject to tax. As with the various other tax measures the General Assembly rushed through on the last day of session, the Fiscal Year 2015 budget they enacte d fails to account for the reductio n in revenue that would result from this provision.3 Mandato ry governme ntal notification before a law applie s would turn on its head the long-standing principle of our democracy that indiv iduals are presumed to know the law. It is one thing to require the governme nt to provide informati on about recent developments in the law so that those affected can adjust their prospective conduct according ly, but it is quite another to conditio n whether that law even applie s on whether someone has received a personal notificatio n of the law's existence. This kind of governme ntal paternalis m is unpre cedented. This legislative session alone the General Assembly passed nearly 200 bills modifying thousands of pages of Missouri law that apply to all manne r of conduct. The General Assembly should not have to send a letter to every Missourian before this legion of new laws takes effect. Similarly , every potential criminal should not have to receive a notice describing this year's revisions to the state's criminal co de before they can be prosecuted unde r it. This provision in Conference Committe e Substitute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 662 also misunde rstands the tax law. Altho ugh a decision of the director of revenue is listed as an example of a \"modification\" triggering notificatio n unde r the bill, the director has no power to finally determine whether an item is taxable or not; that autho rity lies solely with those who write the tax laws\u2014the General Assembly \u2014and those that finally interpret them\u2014the Missouri Supre me Court. See Mo. Const. Art. V, Se c. 3 (g iving the Missouri Supre me Court e xclusive appe llate jurisdictio n over the constructio n of the revenue laws of this state). Similarly , a decision of the adminis trativ e hearing commis sion is listed as something that can trigger notificatio n unde r the bill. However, while the adminis trativ e hearing commis sion has the power to hear indiv idual disputes, a decision of that bo dy is not binding beyond the partie s, and therefore it canno t finally \"modify\" what is or is not tax able for other affe cted sellers. Altho ugh a de cision of the Missouri Supre me Court mig ht \"chang e[ ] which ite ms of tang ible personal property or services are taxable\" within the meaning of the bill, the decisions that purpo rtedly prompte d this provision and many of the new exemptio ns passed on the final day of the legislativ e session did not. 3 Conference Commi ttee Substitute for Senate Commi ttee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 612, which I am also vetoing today, contains a similar provision, but it does not prohibit a business that was properly collecting tax from claiming a refund for taxes paid prior to receiving the notice confirming their obligation to continue doing so. By expressly prohibiting refunds in such situatio ns, Conference Commi ttee Substitute for House Commi ttee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 662 would have a significantly lower fiscal impact than the similar provision in Conference Commi ttee Substitute for Senate Commi ttee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 612.1891 Supplement In each of those cases, the Missouri Supreme Court found that the curre nt law, as enacte d by the General Assembly , require d a tax to be paid, notwithstanding that a particular business had tried to get out of this legal obligation.4 The decisions did not newly subject some item to tax; instead, they simply confirm ed that such items were and are taxable. However, there is nothing in the bill preventing a business from arguing that court decisions like these are \"modificatio ns\" triggering notificatio n to all affected sellers that the Missouri Supre me Court has confirme d that what was always taxable continue s to be taxable. The bill provides far-re aching consequences for such a notificatio n. Unde r the bill, a failure to notify an affected seller \"shall relieve such seller of liability for taxes that would be due unde r the modificatio n.\" See Section 144.021.2. Acco rding ly, receiving a no tificatio n gives any business that w as not collecting taxes prior to the notice retroactiv e immunity for taxes that the Missouri Supre me Court has confirme d should have been collected. Unde r this bill, even the specific business that sought to avoid paying taxes, hired a lawyer to litigate the issue, and lost in court, could argue that it has no tax liability for the taxes the court o rdered it to pay prio r to being notified abo ut the decision in its own cas e. The problems with this provision extend beyond retroactiv e immunity to the additio nal g overnme ntal intrus ion and burde n on taxpayers resulting from the require ment to provide a personal notificatio n to each and every affected seller. Such indiv idualize d notificatio n will require the departme nt of revenue to more closely and more frequently scrutinize sales data and other business informatio n it obtains and to potentially require additio nal informatio n in order to determine precisely which businesses might be affected by a given decision. In additio n, because addre sses, ownership and personal contact informatio n chang e over time , the departme nt would need to gather updated informatio n more frequently and perhaps maintai n a databas e of such informatio n to ensure cost-effective compliance with the personalize d notificatio n require ment of the bill. The need to continually maintain up-to-date informatio n would result in additio nal burde ns for taxpayers that could be avoided with a less onerous, and likely more effective, method of providing generalize d notice of update s in the law than the personal notificatio n mandate d by Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 662. If it were to become law, Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 662 would create no shortage of work for tax attorneys and consultants. It provides a clear incentive for businesses to engage in otherwise unne cessary litigation in the hopes of obtaining a \"decision\" arguably constituting a \"modificatio n\" in order to trigger indiv idual notificatio n and then retroactiv e immunity if they were violating the law. Moreover, it will require all taxpayers to bear the cost of staffing and postage to comply with the personal notificatio n mandate , while putting additio nal burdens on businesses through additional government intrusion into their affairs. While providing up-to-date information to taxpayers is a laudable policy, Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 662 fails to accomplish it and instead puts additional burden 4 This is true whether it was the court reaffirming this year that the tax a laundry first sought to avoid had been in place since at least 1989, see AAA Laundry & Linen Supply Co. v. Director of Revenue, 425 S.W.3d 126, 127 (Mo. banc 2014) (discussing Unitog Rental Services, Inc. v.

Director of Revenue, 362 S.W.3d 1, 2 (Mo. banc 2012); Brinker Missouri, Inc. v. Director of Revenue, 319 S.W.3d 433, 435 (Mo. banc 2010); Union Elec. Co. v.

Acco rding ly, this measure does not receive my suppo rt. Special Exemption for Pers onal Seat Licens es Conference Committe e Substitute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 662 would exempt from tax a right of first refusal for ticke ts sold at the Sprint Center in Kansas City. As with the other new exemptio ns enacte d in this and similar bills, the General Assembly failed to account for the fiscal impact of this exemption in the Fiscal Year 2015 budg et they enacte d. It is uncle ar why this activ ity should receive a new special tax exemptio n, and it is even more unclear why the General Assembly would pass a special law, potentially violating the Missouri Constitutio n, in order to effectuate it. Unfo rtunate ly, because this provision never received a public hearing , the answer remains as elusive as my suppo rt. Corporate Income Allocation Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 662 would enable additio nal businesses to reduce their corporate income taxes by utilizing an alternativ e method of calculating the amount of their income that is derived in Missouri. Legislation enacte d last year autho rized this alternativ e allocatio n me thod for manufacture rs and other businesses selling tang ible personal property. This provision would expand this alternativ e method to sellers of intang ible personal property and service providers such as law firms , accounting firms , stock brokers, bond traders, real estate holding companie s, and co nsultants . Like many of the tax measures enacte d during the final ho urs of the legislativ e session, this provision was never the subject of a public hearing and was not accounte d for in the Fiscal Year 2015 budg et passed by the General Assembly . A chang e to Missouri's tax policy that would reduce state revenues by up to $15 millio n annually according to the legislature 's own estimate should be the subject of open debate, and the foregone revenue must be acco unte d for in the budg et in order to receive my suppo rt. In accordance with the above-stated reasons, I am returning Conference Committe e Substitute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 662 w ithout my appro val.

My reasons for disappro val are as follows: Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 673 would reduce the benefits that an eligible claimant may receive unde r our state's unemplo yment benefits system. It would do so by replacing the maximum numbe r of weeks of unemplo yment benefits that an eligible claimant can receive, which is curre ntly 20 weeks, through a calculatio n indexed to the average statewide unemplo yment rate. Unde r this new calculatio n, claimants eligible for unemplo yment benefits would be limite d to no more than 13 w eeks of benefits if the average statewide unemplo yment rate were below 6%. Claimants could only receive the curre nt maximum of 20 weeks of benefits if the statewide average unemplo yment rate were 9% or higher. This reductio n in benefits would unfairly impact eligible claimants , have a disparate impact on regions of the state experiencing slower economic growth and impe de economic recovery. This legislation is particularly unne cessary given that the state retired its unemplo yment trust fund obligations to the federal g overnme nt las t month. The reductio n to 13 weeks mandate d unde r Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 673 would occur in a system that is hardly lucra tive when measured against the rest of the country . Missouri's average weekly unemplo yment benefit amount is curre ntly the 46th lowest in the natio n. Missouri, at 20 weeks, is one of only eight states that pay less than the natio nal norm of 26 weeks of benefits. If this legislation became law, Missouri, at 13 weeks, would have the third lowest benefit duratio n in the country , behind only Florida and North Caro lina. Missouri's curre nt unemplo yment benefits system is already among the most restrictiv e in the country. Measured against the status quo, therefore, the additio nal limitatio ns mandate d by Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 673 are clearly unne cessary. Suppo rters titute for Senate Bill No . 673 claim the legislation is an attempt to addre ss the solvency of the unemplo yment trust fund, and cite the state's debt to the federal government incurre d to provide benefits during the most recent recession. The need unde rpinning their purpo rted solutio n, ho wever, no longer exists. As noted abo ve, last month, the state repaid its obligations to the federal governme nt, and this legislation would do little to curtail the need to borrow during future economic do wnturns . Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 673 also fails to take into account regional disparitie s in unemplo yment rates with a one size fits all appro ach that would reduce the duratio n of benefits based on a statewide average rate, while ignoring unique local economic conditio ns. For example , in February 2014, the unemplo yment rate for the state was 6.4%, while at the same time ten Missouri countie s had an unemplo yment rate of 10% or higher. Inde xing the duratio n of unemplo yment benefits to a statewide rate would re sult in significant reductio ns in benefits for unemplo yed indiv iduals in are as of the state with much higher unemplo yment rates, and would dramatically slow the recovery in those regions. If a large local emplo yer had massive layoffs or ceased operatio ns, the impact to the county or region's unemplo yment rate could be profound without mate rially incre asing the statewide rate. In such a situatio n, the numbe r of unemplo yed in the affected county or region could far exceed the numbe r of jobs available in the area. Those unemplo yed individuals would be faced with less time for benefits to assist them while searching for gainful emplo yment in an extremely competitive marke t saturate d with more unemplo yed indiv iduals than av ailable jobs. Lastly, Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 673 would render Missouri's unemployment benefits system unable to respond to sudde n spikes in unemplo yment often accompany ing economic downturns . The bill1895 Supplement would bas e curre nt be nefits on pre vious economic conditio ns. The duratio n of benefits reduce d unde r Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 673 would apply to all unemplo yed indiv iduals in the state for an entire year based upon a snaps hot of the statewide average unemplo yment rate taken during the third quarte r of the previous calendar year. This would minimize the ability of the unemplo yment system to help stabilize the economy in instance s where dramatic increases in unemplo yment occur in the first or second quarte r of the calendar year. Unde r such circums tance s, the duratio n of benefits, pegged at the previous year's calculate d rate, would remain unchang ed and artificially low despite the incre ase in unemplo yment. In accordance with the above stated reasons for disappro val, I am returning Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 673 w ithout my appro val. Respectfully submitte d, /s / Jeremiah W . (Jay ) Nix on Governor July 10, 2014 TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE O F THE STATE O F MISSO URI Herewith I re turn to you Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 675 e ntitle d: AN ACT To amend chapte r 70, RSMo , by adding thereto one new section relating to the Missouri local g overnme nt emplo yees' retirement system. I disappro ve of Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 675. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: Senate Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 675 would allow a political subdiv ision to request that the Local Governme nt Emplo yees' Retirement System (LAG ERS) assume all dutie s and responsibilitie s related to the operatio n of the political subdiv ision's prior, closed retirement plan. While there may be benefits for a political subdiv ision to have this option, it should not be provided without regard to the rights of plan participants and to local laws governing the adminis tratio n of police and firefighter retirement plans . Because this is precisely what Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 675 would do , it do es not receive my appro val. Proponents of this legislation have stressed that the bill merely provides the option to trans fer the adminis tratio n of a prior, closed police or firefighter retirement plan to LAG ERS. However, the bill would place the autho rity to exercise this option solely in the hands of the political subdiv ision emplo yer, even if the trans fer was opposed by the plan trustees, who, unlike the political subdiv ision emplo yer, have a fiduciary obligation to plan participants . Moreover, Senate Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 675 would autho rize the political subdiv ision to trans fer plan adminis tratio n to LAG ERS even if the political subdiv ision's own charte r or ordinance s would prohibit it, by autho rizing the trans fer1896 Journal o f the Senate \"[n]o twithstanding any language to the contrary in any other statute , city ordinance or city charte r. . .\" Thus , in a charte r city with a charte r provision requiring a vote of the plan membership in order for there to be a chang e to the retirement plan for police officers and firefighters, this bill would nonetheless allow the political subdiv ision to transfer the retirement plan to LAG ERS without the vote calle d for by the city charte r. Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 675 would also enable political subdiv isions to ignore the wishes of local voters. Voters in a numbe r of Missouri communitie s have appro ved dedicate d sales taxes to fund public safety, including police and fire retirement plan oblig ations. Local voters did so with the understanding that such plan obligations would be manag ed by local trustees. By enabling a political subdiv ision to nonetheless trans fer plan adminis tratio n away from local trustees, Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 675 w ould unde rmine the will of local v oters and should not become the law of the state.

I disappro ve of Conference Committe e Subs titute No. 2 for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 693. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: Conference Committe e Substitute No. 2 for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 693 would continue a damag ing trend by the General Assembly to enact special tax exemptio ns and credits that pick winners and losers through the tax code and shift a greater proportion of the tax burde n to the majority of Mis sourians unable to utilize such lo opho les. No t a penny of the special breaks in this bill or in the others that I am vetoing today1 was taken into account in the Fiscal Year 2015 budg et passed by the General Assembly , leaving it significantly out of balance and requiring swift actio n to protect the State 's fiscal w ell-be ing. This is fiscally irresponsible and canno t receive my suppo rt. 1 Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 584 Conference Committee Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 612; Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 662; House Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 727; Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 829; Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Substitute for Senate Bill No. 860; Senate Committe e Substitute for House Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1296; House Bill No. 1455; and Senate Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1865.1899 Supplement In enacting Conference Committe e Subs titute No. 2 for House Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 693 and its brethren in the final hours of the legislativ e session, the General Assembly disregarded the normal legislativ e process, slipping in costly provisions without public hearings and without fiscal notes reflecting the impact on the state budg et. And just as legislators ignored the legislativ e process, so too did they disregard the budg et process by passing a budg et just a week earlie r that failed to account for this final day spending spree. Unlike the fiscal impact of Senate Subs titute No. 3 for Senate Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill Nos. 509 & 496, which today's lawmake rs have conveniently foisted off on future budgets for educatio n, public safety and other vital public services, the fiscal impact of the special breaks I am vetoing today would begin impacting budgets in the fiscal year starting in less than 30 days. There are no delays, triggers, or other gimmicks that could be touted as shielding educatio n, public safety, and other vital public services, at both the state and local level,2 from the projected $776 millio n in state and local revenue legislators voted to send to narro w special interests on the last day of session. While the General Assembly may have abdicate d its fiscal responsibilitie s in failing to account for this budg etary impact, the resulting imbalance canno t be ignored and will have to be corrected through dramatic s pending reductio ns. Conference Committe e Subs titute No. 2 for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 693 and the other measures I am vetoing today would add to the more than 260 sales tax exemptio ns and tax credits that litter Missouri's tax code without requiring the creation of a single new job. The continue d erosion of the tax base through such indiv idualize d exemptio ns and credits violates well-establis hed principle s of sound tax policy calling for a broad tax base so that tax rates can remain low. The General Assembly has ignored repeated calls to reduce these costly and inefficie nt carve-outs and has instead rushed through many more, leaving Missouri familie s to pick up the tab for educatio n and vital public services. The unabate d growth of such special carve-outs and the fiscal irresponsibility of failing to budg et for them are all the more troubling when the General Assembly is simultane ously seeking to raise taxes on all Missourians with what could be the largest tax hike in Missouri history. While the benefits of the more than o ne billio n dollars in annual tax breaks passed by the legislature over the past two months will go disproportionately to the wealthy , the burde n of this multi-billio n dollar tax incre ase for trans portatio n would fall dis proportionately on Mis souri's working familie s and s eniors. 2 In additio n to impacting the general local sales tax imposed unde r Section 32.085, exemptions from local sales tax would reduce revenue collected through num erous voter-appr oved local sales taxes that are targeted to specific, community suppo rted needs.

Ins tead, the y seek to overrule no fewer than tw enty Missouri Supre me Court cas es going back to 1977 that have been followed by the departme nt of revenue over the course of previous and curre nt adminis tratio ns. In nearly every one of the cases sought to be overturne d, the court ruled that the law enacte d by the General Assembly require d a tax to be collected, notwithstanding that a particular bus inesses had ho ped to be excused from the legal obligations we all share . While it is well within the rights of a losing litigant to petition their elected representativ es, it is wholly disingenuous to call doing so here anything other than what it is\u2014seeking a special exemptio n from the law, as curre ntly written and as confirme d by the courts. Thro ughout my time as Governor, I have worked with legislators on fiscally responsible ways to impro ve our tax code while protecting our state's fiscal health, including the four tax cuts that I have signed into law. Even during this legislative session, I worked directly with legislators to put forward a specific, concrete proposal that would have lowered taxes for Missourians and reined in costly and inefficie nt tax credits for special interests, broadening the overall tax base and reducing tax rates, while protecting our ability to invest in educatio n and other vital public services. Unfo rtunate ly, the General Assembly refused to enact this broad tax relief in favor of narro w giveaways like those containe d in Conference Committe e Subs titute No. 2 for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 693 and the other bills I am v etoing today. For the reasons stated herein, this is an e ndeavor I canno t suppo rt. Special Exemption for Us ed C ars Conference Committe e Substitute No. 2 for House Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 693 exempts used cars that are 10-years or older from sales tax when the sale price is less than $15,000. Acco rding to the legislature 's own estimate , this provision would reduce state and local revenues by as much as $60 millio n annually , with more than $30 millio n annually in reduce d revenue for highways and $26 millio n annually in reduce d revenue for local jurisdictio ns.3 Not only would this revenue reductio n impact the amount of state and local highway mainte nance and constructio n that can be unde rtake n, it could also jeopardize matching federal highway funds and make it more difficult to cover debt service on previously issued bonds to finance state and local road and bridg e projects. With the average age of vehicles on Ame rica's roads increasing to 11.4 years, the numbe r of vehicle s subject to this exemptio n and the corresponding impact to state and lo cal re venue is likely to incre ase over time .4 I canno t suppo rt a new sales tax exemptio n that would drain funding for trans portatio n at the very same time the General Assembly is asking Missourians to foot the bill on a $6 billio n sales tax incre ase to fund trans portatio n needs. By passing this legislation and voting to put a sales tax incre ase for trans portatio n on the ballo t, the General Assembly is with one hand doling out special breaks that would directly and permane ntly reduce funding for roads, while with the other hand reaching into the pockets of every Missourian for more road funding . This is poor fiscal policy and poor tax policy, and therefore does not receive my appro val. Conference Committe e Subs titute No. 2 for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 693 has a 3 The $26 million annual reduction in local revenue from this provisio n is not dissim ilar to the local revenue loss that was antic ipate d as a result of local jurisdic tions no longer being able to collect tax on out-of-state vehicle purchase s following the decision in Street v. Director of Revenue, 361 S.W.3d 355, 356 (Mo. banc 2012). It is puzzling that after passing legislatio n to prevent this antic ipate d loss of local tax revenue last year, the General Assembly would turn around the very next year and pass legislatio n to drain a similar amount of revenue from those same local jurisdictions. 4 https: //www. polk.com/company/ of additio nal problems that prevent it from receiving my signature . First, it fails to treat similarly -situate d tax payers similarly , instead picking as winners the purchas ers of certain used cars based on the age of the vehicle and its sale price , while leaving all remaining purchas ers in the dust. In additio n, the limitation to vehicle s 10-years or older and with a sale price of $15,000 or less is an arbitrary cut-o ff that will lead to absurd results. For example, there is no sound economic or policy reason for why a nine year-old vehicle that costs $14,999 or an 11-year old vehicle that costs $15,001 is any more or less deserving of a tax exemptio n than the vehicle s covered by this bill. These are precisely the kind of problems created with special carve-outs that pick winners and losers based on arbitrary distinctio ns rathe r than s ound tax or economic po licy. In additio n, as drafte d this exemptio n is ripe for abus e and can easily be manipulate d to avoid or reduce taxes on purchas es not intended for the exemptio n. For example , curre nt law allows the seller of a vehicle to use the vehicle 's sales price as a cre dit to ward the purchas e price of a subsequent vehicle in determining the tax due on the purchas e.5 With the new exemptio n in Conference Committe e Subs titute No. 2 for House Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 693, used car dealers could set up straw trans actio ns to sell used cars older than 10 y ears to their cus tomers and the n take those same cars as trade -ins toward newer cars, which would allow their customers to reduce or avoid paying altogether the tax on the newer car purchas e. That this may be an uninte nded consequence of the legislation does not make its impact o n state and lo cal budg ets any less real or imme diate . Special Exemption for Pers onal Seat Licens es Conference Committe e Substitute No. 2 for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 693 would exempt from tax a right of first refusal for ticke ts sold at the Sprint Center in Kansas City. As with the other new exemptio ns enacte d in this and similar bills, the General Assembly failed to account for the fiscal impact of this exemptio n in the Fiscal Year 2015 budg et they enacte d. It is unclear why this activ ity should receive a new special tax exemptio n, and it is even more unclear why the General Assembly would pass a special law, potentially violating the Missouri Constitutio n, in order to effectuate it. Unfo rtunate ly, because this provision never received a public hearing , the answer remains as elusive as my suppo rt. Expans ion of the W ine & Grape Tax C redit Conference Committe e Substitute No. 2 for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 693 would expand the Wine and Grape Productio n Tax Credit by making purchas es of used equipme nt eligible for the credit. The General Assembly failed to account for the estimate d $125,000 reductio n in state revenue from this expans ion in the Fiscal Y ear 2015 budg et the y passed. 5 Section 144.025, RSMo , provides: Notwithstanding any other provisio ns of law to the contrary, in any retail sale . . . where any article on whic h sales or use tax has been paid, credited, or otherwise satisfie d or whic h was exempted or excluded from sales or use tax is taken in trade as a credit or part paym ent on the purchase price of the article being sold, the tax imposed by sections 144.020 and 144.440 shall be compute d only on that portion of the purchase price whic h exceeds the actual allowanc e made for the article traded in or exchange d . . .

It is difficult to believe that the continue d success of this thriv ing indus try depends on the expans ion of this relativ ely modest governme nt subsidy. While the wine industry has a tremendous positive economic impact for the state, the Wine and Grape Productio n Tax Credit fails to generate a positive return, with the most recent cost benefit analy sis indicating that for every dollar in tax credits issued, the state could expect to receive just 3 cents in general revenue return. The lack o f a po sitive return on investment is what prompte d the bipartis an Tax Credit Re view Co mmis sion to call fo r the outrig ht eliminatio n of the credit. Unlike other tax credits enacte d or reautho rized this legislativ e session, this expans ion of the Wine and Grape Productio n Tax Credit would not make it subject to appro priatio n or restructure it in a way that would make it revenue-neutral. Instead, Conference Committe e Subs titute No. 2 for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 693 would simply broaden the activ ities eligible for the credit, thereby incre asing the credit's cost and diverting additio nal funding from educatio n and other vital public services, none of which was taken into account in the budg et passed by the General Assembly .

I disappro ve of House Committe e Substitute for Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 694. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 694 provides false hope of true payday lending reform while in reality falling far short of the mark. This bill canno t be calle d meaning ful re form and do es not receive my appro val. Suppo rters point to the lower cap on interest this bill would impo se, but allowing payday lenders to charg e 912.5% fo r a 14-day loan is not true reform. Suppo rters point to the require ment that pay day lenders offer extended payment plans , but in states where payday lenders are require d to offer such plans they are seldom used by borrowers. Suppo rters point to the legislation's require ment for payday lenders to comply with \"restrictio ns and prohibitio ns applicable to credito rs containe d in the federal Fair1903 Supplement Debt Collection Practice s Act,\" but the Fair Debt Collection Practice s Act does not apply to creditors, which renders this require ment hollow. Suppo rters point to the prohibitio n on loan rollovers, but missing from the legislation is anything to addre ss the unfortunate ly all-to o-commo n situatio n where someone living paycheck-to -paycheck is offered multiple loans by multiple lenders at the same time or is encourag ed to take out back-to -back lo ans from the same lender. Altho ugh some may contend that House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 694 is an impro vement over the status quo, it fails to protect consumers and fails to prevent the cycle of debt that payday lending perpetuate s.

I am today returning Conference Committe e Subs titute No. 2 for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 716 with my appro val. This bill has provisions that will advance public health in Missouri, and I suppo rt those provisions. However, it also contains provisions that are caus e for concern. The concerning provisions in Conference Committe e Subs titute No. 2 for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 716 would create a new medical license for \"assistant physicians .\" Unde r the bill, graduate s of medical school who have not comple ted a residency or received a license to practice medicine could nevertheless obtain a license as an \"assistant physician,\" which would allow them to engage in the limite d practice of medicine in underserved areas. The bill would require such indiv iduals to have a collabo rativ e arrang ement with a licensed physician, who is to supervise and perform chart review of the assistant physician's work. Additionally , the bill would limit the type of care that as sistant phy sicians can pro vide. Because this new licensure for \"assistant physicians \" would circumv ent well-establis hed and long- standing physician licensing procedure s, additio nal safeguards are necessary to ensure that indiv iduals who have failed to comple te residency or failed to obtain physician licensure for competency or other reasons are not allowed to practice as assistant physicians . Ensuring that all Missourians have access to adequate health care is a laudable goal, but it is equally impo rtant that such measures do not place citize ns' health in jeopardy . Considering that this new category of licensure would make Missouri unique among states and would embark upon uncharte red wate rs in providing health care for Missourians , it is imperativ e that there be compre hensive and rigorous oversight and regulatio n of such \"assistant phy sicians .\" In accordance with the above stated reasons for approval, I am returning Conference Committe e Subs titute No. 2 for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 716 w ith my appro val.

My reasons for disappro val are as follows: House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 727 would continue a damag ing trend by the General Assembly to enact special tax exemptio ns and credits that pick winne rs and losers through the tax code and shift a greater proportion of the tax burde n to the majority of Missourians unable to utilize such loopholes. Not a penny of the special breaks in this bill or in the others that I am vetoing today1 was taken into account in the Fiscal Year 2015 budg et passed by the General Assembly , leaving it significantly out of balance and requiring swift action to protect the State 's fiscal well-being. This is fiscally irresponsible and canno t receive my suppo rt. House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 727 contains a numbe r of provisions that could become law with my action on other legislation. However, I canno t suppo rt adding to the more than 200 sales tax exemptio ns in curre nt law that divert funding from educatio n, public safety, and other vital public services, particularly when the General Assembly has failed to account for it in the budg et they passed. House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 727 would provide a new exemptio n from state and local taxes for sales of farm products at a farme rs' marke t by entitie s who estimate that their annual farme rs' marke t sales will be less than $25,000. This means that entitie s who estimate that their annual fame rs' marke t sales will be $25,000 or more would be subject to state and local tax. The sale of agricultural products grown in Missouri as well as those grown in o ther states would be subject to the exemptio n. This provision, as drafte d, would create confusion among both sellers and customers at farme rs' marke ts and lead to significant governme ntal intrus ion into their affairs . First, the bill contains an arbitrary limitatio n as to who is eligible for the exemptio n and who would have to collect tax based solely on whether they estimate they will have more or less than $25,000 in farme rs' marke ts sales. Thus , an indiv idual who estimate s sales of $24,999 would not have to collect tax, but an individual estimating a dollar more in sales would. This could result in a consumer paying sales tax on the corn they purchas e at one booth, while buying the corn tax free at the booth rig ht ne xt door. In additio n, whether the tax applie s is based on estimated , rathe r than actual sales. This would mean that a seller with actual sales far in excess of the $25,000 limitatio n could continue to sell products tax-free, so long as they had previously \"estimate d\" that their sales would be below the $25,000 threshold. For example , unde r the bill a seller who estimate s $20,000 in sales but who actually has $30,000 would not have to collect taxes on any of their sales, while a seller who estimate s their sales at $30,000 but has actual sales of just $20,000 w ould hav e to collect tax es. The provision would als o incre ase governme ntal intrus ion in o rder to police the limitatio n for $25,000 in estimate d annual sales. There is nothing in the bill directing how the estimate d annual sales are to be derived, or to whom or how the required estimate is to be reported. Presumably , it will require all farmers' market sellers to complete paperwork and be subject to an audit of their sales information from at least the three previous years to determine the validity of the annual sales estimate. This would result in significant government access into otherwise private business information, which would appear inconsistent with the overall intent of this new exemption. 1 Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 584; Conference Committee Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 612; Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 662; Conference Committee Substitute No. 2 for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 693; Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 829; Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Substitute for Senate Bill No. 860; Senate Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1296; House Bill No. 1455; and Senate Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1865.1907 Supplement In accordance with the above-stated reasons for disappro val, I am returning House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 727 w ithout my appro val.

(Jay ) Nix on Governor July 7, 2014 TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE O F THE STATE O F MISSO URI Herewith I re turn to you Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 731 e ntitle d: AN ACT 82.1028, 82.1029, and 82.1030, RSMo , and to enact in lieu thereof six new sections relating to property regulatio ns in certain cities and countie s. I disappro ve of Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 731. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: Senate Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 731 began as a well-me aning measure to provide additio nal tools for neighborhood organizatio ns and property owners to hold negligent property owners accountable for diminis hed property values and unsafe conditio ns. However, an amendme nt adde d on the Senate floor would infring e upon private property rights by giving a broad new immunity for pollute rs creating environmental hazards and contaminatio n that reduce nearby property values. For this reason, Se nate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 731 do es not receive my appro val. 1908 Journal o f the Senate The Senate floor amendme nt to Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 731, adde d as section 1 to the bill, w ould pro vide: No actio n shall be brought unde r section 82.1025 or sections 82.1027 to 82.1030 if the owner of the property that is the subject of the actio n is in good faith co mpliance with any order issued by the departme nt of natural resource s, the Unite d State s Environmental Pro tection Ag ency, or the office of atto rney general. (emphas is adde d). This broad immunity would bar statuto ry nuisance actio ns by private property owners and neighborhood organizatio ns in the countie s of Jefferson, Platte , Franklin, Cass, Clay , Cole, and Cape Girarde au, and the cities of Spring field, St. Louis and Kansas City in the circums tance s outline d. This would diminis h the rights of property owners unde r curre nt law to hold someone accountable for actio ns that reduce property values and create hazards to health, safety and the environment. For example , assume private property owners in St. Louis County are attempting to bring a statuto ry nuisance actio n seeking damag es from the owner of a landfill that is contaminating nearby properties, creating noxious fume s, and decreasing area property values. Altho ugh such an actio n might proceed unde r curre nt law, this bill would prohibit it if the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Departme nt of Natural Resource s (DNR), or the Attorney General has ordered the landfill operator to clean up the contaminatio n and the company is atte mpting to comply with that o rder. Not only would this new immunity deprive private property owners of rights they enjoy unde r curre nt law, its ambig uous wording would confer immunity even w hen the referenced governme nt order does not apply to the property creating the nuisance . For example , assume DNR issues an order requiring a utility company to clean up contaminatio n at a former facility in Rando lph County . If the utility is complying with that clean-up order, this bill would also give the company immunity for operations creating a nuisance at its facilitie s in Franklin, St. Louis, Jefferson, Cape Girarde au, and Cole countie s. In additio n, the ambig uous language of this immunity provision does not even require the party creating the nuis ance to actually be in compliance with any of the referenced governme nt orders. Ins tead, the immunity would be triggered upon \"good faith,\" as opposed to actual , compliance . This could prevent private property owners from bring ing a statuto ry nuisance action even when the party creating the nuisance is curre ntly violating a governme nt order. For example , a quarry in Cape Girarde au could be violating a DNR order to control dust emissions contaminating nearby property, but unde r this bill adjoining property owners would be barre d from bringing a statuto ry nuisance action to protect their property so long as the quarry is attempting , even if unsuccessfully , to comply with the DNR order. Similarly , a chemical company in Cass County attempting to comply with a DNR order to clean up hazardo us waste on its property may be immune from suit even if contaminatio n from the burie d chemicals has migrated into the drinking water used by neighboring property owners. Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 731 began with a noble purpo se of strengthening the rights of property owners and neighbo rhood organizatio ns, but the chang es during the legislativ e process, particularly the Senate floor amendme nt providing a broad new immunity for those damag ing the property of others, would mo ve the state in the opposite dire ction. This I canno t suppo rt. In accordance with the above stated reasons for disappro val, I am returning Senate Committee Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 731 w ithout my appro val.

Respectfully submitte d, /s / Jeremiah W .

I am today returning Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute No. 2 for Senate Bill No. 754 with my approval. This bill has provisions that will advance public health in Missouri, and I suppo rt those provisions. However, it also contains provisions that are cause for concern. The concerning provisions in Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute No. 2 for Senate Bill No. 754 would create a new medical license for \"assistant physicians .\" Unde r the bill, graduate s of medical school who have not comple ted a residency or received a license to practice medicine could nevertheless obtain a license as an \"assistant physician,\" which would allow them to engage in the limite d practice of medicine in unde rserved areas. The bill would require such individuals to have a collabo rativ e arrang ement with licensed physician, who is to supervise and perform chart review of the assistant physician's work. Additio nally , the bill would limit the type of care that as sistant phy sicians can pro vide. Because this new licensure for \"assistant physicians \" would circumv ent well-establis hed and long- standing physician licensing procedure s, additio nal safeguards are necessary to ensure that indiv iduals who have failed to comple te residency or failed to obtain physician licensure for competency or other reasons are not allowed to practice as assistant physicians . Ensuring that all Missourians have access to adequate health care is a laudable goal, but it is equally impo rtant that such measures do not place citize ns' health in jeopardy . Considering that this new category of licensure would make Missouri unique among states and would embark upon uncharte red waters in providing health care for Missourians , it is imperativ e that there be compre hensive and rigorous oversight and regulatio n of such \"assistant phy sicians .\" In accordance with the above stated reasons for appro val, I am returning Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute No. 2 for Senate Bill No. 754 with my appro val.

I disappro ve of Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 829. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 829 would continue a damag ing trend by the General Assembly to enact special tax exemptio ns and credits that pick winners and losers through the tax code and shift a greater proportion of the tax burde n to the majority of Missourians unable to utilize such loopholes. Not a penny of the special breaks that I am vetoing today1 or the provisions of this bill making such s pecial bre aks far e asier to exploit was take n into acco unt in the Fiscal Y ear 2015 budg et pas sed by the General Assembly , leaving it significantly out of balance and requiring swift actio n to protect the State 's fiscal w ell-be ing. This is fiscally irresponsible and canno t receive my suppo rt. In enacting Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 829 and its brethren in the final hours of the legislativ e session, the General Assembly disregarded the normal legislativ e process, slipping in costly provisions witho ut public hearing s and without fiscal notes reflecting the impact on the state budg et. And just as legislators ignored the legislativ e process, so too did they disregard the budg et process by passing a budg et just a week earlie r that failed to account for this final day spending spree. Unlike the fiscal impact of Senate Subs titute No. 3 for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill Nos. 509 & 496, which today's lawmake rs have conveniently foisted off on future budgets for educatio n, public safety and v ital public s ervices, the fiscal impact o f the special bre aks I am v etoing today would begin impacting budg ets in the fiscal year starting in less than 30 days. There are no delays, triggers, or other gimmicks that co uld be touted as shielding educatio n, public s afety, and o ther vital public s ervices, at both the state and local level, from the projected $776 millio n in state and local revenue legislators voted to send to narro w special interests on the last day of session. While the General Assembly may have abdicate d its fiscal responsibilitie s in failing to account for this budg etary impact, the resulting imbalance canno t be ignored and w ill hav e to be corrected thro ugh dramatic s pending reductio ns. Thro ughout my time as Governor, I have worked with legislators on fiscally responsible ways to impro ve our tax code while protecting our state's fiscal health, including the four tax cuts that I have signed into law. Even during this legislativ e session, I worked directly with legislators to put forward a specific, concrete proposal that would have lowered taxes for Missourians and reined in costly and inefficie nt tax credits for special interests, broadened the overall tax base and reduce d tax rates, while protecting our ability to invest in educatio n and other vital public services. Unfortunately, the General Assembly refused to enact this broad tax relief in favor of narro w giveaways like those containe d in the bills that I am vetoing today and which would be facilitate d by Senate Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 829. Fo r the reasons stated herein, this is an e ndeavor I canno t suppo rt. 1 Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 584 Conference Committee Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 612; Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 662; Conference Committee Substitute No. 2 for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 693; House Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 727; Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Substitute for Senate Bill No. 860; Senate Committe e Substitute for House Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1296; House Bill No. 1455; and Senate Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1865. 1916 Journal o f the Senate Proving Eligibility for Tax Exemptions While the other bills that I am vetoing today create broad new tax exemptio ns, Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 829 would make these new exemptio ns, as well as the more than 200 sales tax exemptio ns in curre nt law, far easier to exploit by no longer requiring a business claiming a tax exemptio n to prove it is actually eligible for the claime d exemptio n. While I suppo rt eliminating the arbitrary limitatio n in curre nt law that puts the burde n of proof on some businesses but not others in determining tax liability , when it comes to someone trying to claim a tax exemptio n, they should at a minimum be require d to show that they are entitle d to it. Claiming a special carve-out or loophole without evidence to suppo rt it is unfair to the vast majority of Missouri taxpayers who lack the influe nce to get special tax exemptio ns crafte d for them by the General As sembly . With the help of the legislature and the best accounting and legal advice, those fortunate enough to take advantag e of special exemptio ns would now be given every incentive to push the outer boundarie s of any exemptio ns that could conceivably apply , furthe r eroding the tax base and shifting an even greater tax burde n to the majority of taxpayers. Not content with merely showering the fortunate with a cavalcade of new tax breaks, the General Assembly has gone furthe r to stack the deck in their favor and to provide an adde d incentive to try on an exemptio n just to see if it fits. This is not a tax policy that I can suppo rt. In accordance with the above-stated reasons for disappro val and for the reasons stated in the other veto messages issued this day, I am returning Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 829 without my appro val. Since rely, /s / Jeremiah W . (Jay ) Nix on Governor July 14, 2014 TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE O F THE STATE O F MISSO URI Herewith I return to you Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 841 entitle d: AN ACT To repeal 407.931, 407.933, and 407.934, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof seven new sections relating to alternative nicotine or vapor products, with penalty provisions. I disappro ve of Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 841. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Substitute for Senate Bill No. 841 would exclude \"alte rnativ e nicotine products \" and \"vapor products\" - \"electronic cigarettes\" - from the definitio n of \"tobacco products \" and prohibit them from being regulate d or taxed as \"tobacco products \" unde r Missouri law. This bill, which is supported by sellers of such products and at least one major tobacco manufacture r but is oppo sed by leading health organizations, creates a fa\u00e7ade of regulatio n and is actually harmf ul to Missourians because of the special exemptio ns it provides for these dang erous1917 Supplement products . As a result, it do es not meet with my appro val. \"Electronic cigarettes\" are nicotine delivery devices that resemble traditio nal tobacco cigarettes in appe arance , use and functio n, and share a signature ingredient - the highly addictiv e chemical nicotine, which is derived from tobacco. Electronic cigarettes typically consist of a cartridg e and batte ry that deliver nico tine to users by heating a liquid s olutio n containing propylene glycol (which can cause eye and respirato ry irritatio n), glycerine, flavoring agents, creates a nicotine- infus ed aerosol that, similar to tobacco smoke from traditio nal tobacco cigarettes, the smoker inhale s and exhales. Studie s have also noted the presence of formalde hyde (a known carcino gen) and acetalde hyde (a possible carcino gen) in the aerosol. Electronic cigarettes are frequently marke ted and brande d with name s reflecting flavors adde d to the nicotine aerosol. Though electronic cigarettes are relativ ely new, having been patented in 2003 by a Chine se pharmacis t and s old in the Unite d State s only since 2007, they are growing in popularity with sales projected to top $1.5 billio n in the Unite d State s this year. These electronic cig arettes are incre asingly manufacture d by big tobacco companie s.1 Because Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 841 would limit any additio nal state regulatio n of these products and would contrav ene pending federal regulatio ns, it does not receive my appro val. First, Missouri law should not limit the regulatio n of products derived from tobacco that contain a highly addictiv e chemical and carcino genic, noxious chemicals . Not unlike traditio nal tobacco cigarettes, these products may carry significant health risks to users and others through direct and secondhand inhalatio n in a manne r not unlike traditio nal to bacco cigarettes. Leading health organizatio ns oppose Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 841, including the Ame rican Cance r Society; the Ame rican Lung Associatio n; the Ame rican Heart Associatio n; the Missouri State Medical Association; the Missouri Associatio n of Osteopathic Physicians ; the Missouri Acade my of Fam ily Physicians; the Campaig n for Tobacco -Free Kids ; and Tobacco Free Missouri, and for good reasons. Through direct and secondhand exposure, e-cigarette smokers inhale an aerosol containing nicotine, which is addictive and derived from tobacco ; propylene glycol, which can cause eye and respirato ry irritatio n; and also likely formalde hyde, a known carcino gen, and acetalde hyde, a possible carcino gen. Studie s have also found the presence of heavy metal particle s such as tin, nicke l, copper, lead and chromium in the aerosol, which can deposit in smokers' lungs and cause respirato ry problems. A 2009 FDA study also detected the presence of diethylene glycol, a toxic chemical commo nly used in antifre eze, in e-cig arette sample s. These products are barely a decade old, and their sales are skyrocketing. We should not enact an outrig ht ban on regulating and taxing as \"tobacco products \" these tobacco -derived products that contain harmful substance s, including carcino gens, particularly when the short and lo ng-term he alth ris ks of these products are still be ing evaluate d. The special tre atment fo r these tobacco -derived products provided in Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 841 would validate the as yet unpro ven claim that they are safer than traditio nal tobacco products . Second, Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 841 would harm the health of Missourians because it would contrav ene and unde rmine more compre hensive proposed federal regulatio n. Unlike Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill 841, federal FDA regulatio ns proposed earlie r this year would classify electronic cigarettes and similar nicotine products as \"tobacco products .\" The proposed FDA rules would prohibit sales to mino rs (as would this bill), but, unlike Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 841, w ould als o require electronic cigarette manufacture rs to provide health warning s; register with the FDA and report product and ingredient listings; marke t new products only after FDA review; make claims of reduce d risk only if the FDA conclude s that the re is suppo rting scientific e vidence and that marke ting the product w ill 1 The bill also encompasse s other relative ly new \"alte rnative nicotine products\" such as flavo red disso lvable pellets or flat strips containing ground tobacco. 1918 Journal o f the Senate benefit public health; not distribute free sample s; and not sell in vending machine s, unless in locatio ns off limits to youths. Considering that these products contain the tobacco derivative and highly addictiv e chemical compound nicotine, mimic traditio nal tobacco cigarettes in use, appe arance , and functio n, pose significant health risks that are still being evaluate d, and are incre asingly manufacture d by big tobacco companie s, regulating them as traditio nal tobacco products , as the FDA is proposing, does not seem unre asonable . Proponents of Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 841 to ut its ban on sales to mino rs, but the proposed FDA regulatio ns also ban sales to mino rs. In light of this ban in the FDA regulations, the primary and more significant conseque nce of Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 841 is its limitatio n on additio nal regulatio ns. I would suppo rt legislation banning sales to mino rs and classifying these products as \"tobacco products \" as appro priate first steps in state n witho ut impe ding additio nal federal regulatio n, but I will not suppo rt the false pretense of reform and circumv entio n of more string ent federal regulatio n that would result from Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 841. As noted above, leading health organizatio ns unifo rmly oppo se this bill. By contras t, manufacture rs of alternativ e nicotine products , sellers of such products , and at least one major tobacco manufacture r are suppo rters of the bill. At a minimum, prohibiting the regulatio n and tax ation as \"tobacco products \" of products that are derived from tobacco is premature and would create unce rtainty around the proposed FDA regulatio ns. At worst, this prohibitio n may be part of a larger strate gy by the tobacco indus try to stop the imple mentatio n of the FDA regulatio ns or ensnare them in protracte d litigation. Whether Senate Subs titute for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 841 is merely premature or instead mo tivated by more insidious reasons, the bill is harmful to the health o f Mis sourians .

My reasons for disappro val are as follows: Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 860 would continue a damag ing trend by the General Assembly to enact special tax exemptio ns and credits that pick winners and losers through the tax code and shift a greater proportion of the tax burde n to the majority of Missourians unable to utilize such loopholes. Not a penny of the special breaks in this bill or in the others that I am vetoing today1 was taken into account in the Fiscal Year 2015 budg et passed by the General Assembly , leaving it significantly out of balance and requiring swift actio n to protect the State 's fiscal w ell-being. This is fiscally irresponsible and canno t receive my suppo rt. In enacting Conference Committe e Substitute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Substitute for Senate Bill No. 860 and its brethren in the final hours of the legislativ e session, the General Assembly disregarded the normal legislativ e process, slipping in costly provisions without public hearing s and without fiscal notes reflecting the impact on the state budg et. And just as legislators ignored the legislativ e process, so too did they disregard the budg et process by passing a budg et just a week earlier that failed to account for this final day spending spree. Unlike the fiscal impact of Senate Subs titute No. 3 for Senate Committe e Subs titute for Senate Bill Nos. 509 & 496, which today's lawmake rs have conveniently foisted off on future budg ets for educatio n, public safety and other vital public services, the fiscal impact of the special breaks I am vetoing today would begin impacting budg ets in the fiscal year starting in less than 30 days. There are no delays, triggers, or other gimmicks that co uld be touted as shielding educatio n, public safety, and other vital public services, at both the state and local level, from the projected $776 millio n in state and local revenue legislators voted to send to narro w special interests on the last day of session. While the General Assembly may have abdicate d its fiscal responsibilitie s in failing to account for this budg etary impact, the resulting imbalance canno t be ignored and will have to be corrected thro ugh dramatic s pending reductio ns. Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Substitute for Senate Bill No. 860 and the other measures I am vetoing today would add to the more than 260 sales tax exemptio ns and tax credits that litter Missouri's tax code without requiring the creation of a single new job. The continued erosion of the tax base through such indiv idualize d exemptio ns and credits violates well- establis hed principle s of sound tax policy calling for a broad tax base so that tax rates can remain low. The General Assembly has ignored repeated calls to reduce these costly and inefficie nt carve-outs and has instead rushed through many more, leaving Missouri familie s to pick up the tab for educatio n and other vital public s ervices. The unabate d growth of such special carve-outs and the fiscal irresponsibility of failing to budg et for them are all the more troubling when the General Assembly is simultane ously seeking to raise taxes on all Missourians with what could be the largest tax hike in Missouri history. While the benefits of the more than o ne billio n dollars in annual tax breaks passed by the legislature over the past two months will go disproportionately to the wealthy , the burde n of this multi-billio n dollar tax incre ase for trans portatio n would fall dis proportionately on Mis souri's working familie s and s eniors. Thro ughout my time as Governor, I have worked with legislators on fiscally responsible ways to impro ve 1 Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 584 Conference Committee Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 612; Conference Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 662; Conference Committee Substitute No. 2 for House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 693; House Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 727; Senate Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 829; Senate Committee Substitute for House Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1296; House Bill No. 1455; and Senate Substitute for Senate Committee Substitute for House Bill No. 1865.1921 Supplement our tax code while protecting our state's fiscal health, including the four tax cuts that I have signed into law. Even during this legislativ e session, I worked directly with legislators to put forward a specific, concrete proposal that would have lowered taxes for Missourians and reined in costly and inefficie nt tax credits for special interests, broadening the overall tax base and reducing tax rates, while protecting our ability to invest in educatio n and other vital public services. Unfo rtunate ly, the General Assembly refused to enact this broad tax relief in favor of narro w giveaways like those containe d in Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 860 and the other bills I am vetoing today. For the reasons stated herein, this is an endeavor I canno t suppo rt. Tax Refunds to Delinquent Taxpayers Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 860 would modify the establis hed process for obtaining a sales tax refund by allowing a refund even when a taxpayer curre ntly has overdue taxes. This provision is projected to reduce state and local revenue by up to $10 millio n annually , altho ugh the General Assembly failed to account for any of this fiscal impact in the Fiscal Year 2015 budg et they passed. As with many of the tax measures passed by the legislature on the last day of session, this provision was not the subject of a public hearing in any Senate committe e. This provision would enable a business with significant tax delinque ncies to get a tax refund for an unre lated overpay ment of tax, where unde r curre nt law the refund could be offset by the amount of tax delinque ncy. For example , unde r this provision even a business that owes $100,000 in back taxes would be able to get a refund check from the state for a $100,000 uninte ntional overpay ment, so long as the $100,000 tax delinque ncy is subject to appe al. Unde r curre nt law, the $100,000 refund would be offset by the entire $100,000 tax delinque ncy, thereby eliminating the need to later engage in costly and inefficie nt collection efforts to recover the $100,000 in overdue taxes. Such a chang e to the establis hed refund process would unfairly reward those who fail to pay their taxes and would result in costly inefficie ncies borne by all law-abiding taxpayers. Acco rding ly, this provision does not receive my suppo rt. Sales Tax Holiday Expans ion Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 860 expands the back-to -school sales tax holiday by adding graphing calculato rs to the list of items that can be purchas ed tax-free. This expans ion is projected to reduce state revenue by as much as $200,000 annually , which the General Assembly failed to account for in the Fiscal Year 2015 budget they passed. Like many of the tax provisions passed during the final day of session, this provision was not the subject of a public he aring in any Senate committe e. Because Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committ ee Substitute for Senate Substitute for Senate Bill No. 860 expands the curre nt sales tax holiday without the General Assembly accounting for the accompany ing revenue reductio n in the budg et they enacte d, this expans ion does not receive my appro val. In accordance with the above-stated reasons for disappro val, I am returning Conference Committe e Subs titute for House Committe e Subs titute for Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 860 without my appro val. Since rely, /s / Jeremiah W . (Jay ) Nix on Governor1922 Journal o f the Senate July 10, 2014 TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE O F THE STATE O F MISSO URI Herewith I re turn to you Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 866 e ntitle d: AN ACT To amend chapte r 408, RSMo , by adding thereto one new section relating to installme nt loan le nders. I disappro ve of Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 866. My reasons for disappro val are as follows: Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 866 would create a new term to describe a short-term lender not licensed as a bank or credit union\u2014a \"traditio nal installme nt lender\"\u2014and would restrict the autho rity of local governme nts with respect to such entitie s. Because this chang e would unduly interfere with local co ntrol, the bill do es not receive my appro val. The new classificatio n \"traditio nal installme nt lenders\" sought to be establis hed in Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 866 would cover two types of consumer lenders licensed by the state\u2014consumer installme nt lenders and small loan companie s. Small loan companie s can make loans of $500 and over, while consumer installme nt lenders can make loans of any amount, but the loans must be repaid in at least four installme nts over at least 120 days. There are no restrictio ns on the interest consumer installme nt lenders or small loan companie s can impo se and just last year the General Assembly incre ased the maximum amount of originatio n fees consumer installme nt lenders and small loan companie s can charg e. See Senate Committe e Subs titute for House Bill No . 329 (2013). A numbe r of Missouri municipalitie s have enacte d ordinance s that impo se zoning, permitting , and other restrictio ns on short-term, small loan lenders.1 For example , the City of Kans as City enacte d an ordinance in 2007 regulating \"short-term loan establis hments\" and broadened its ordinance in 2011 to specifically regulate consumer installme nt lenders. Kansas City was able to successfully defend this ordinance against court challe nge brought by one of the regulate d lenders. Perhaps recognizing this legislation as an assault on their autho rity to maintain this ordinance , the City of Kansas City was able to obtain a carv e-out fro m the restrictio ns of this bill. rtunate ly, the rest of Missouri's political subdiv isions were not so fortunate , since Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 866 would preempt any existing charter provision or ordinance that does not \"expressly apply \" to \"traditio nal installme nt lenders\" as of August 28, 2014. Because this bill would also be creating the new label of \"traditio nal installme nt lenders,\" it is highly unlike ly that any curre nt ordinance s or charte r provisions \"expressly apply \" to such newly-chris tened lenders. Moreover, Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 866 would also prevent communitie s from modifying curre nt ordinance s 1 Communitie s such as Arnold, Bellefontaine Neighbo rs, Berkeley, Blue Springs, Inde pendence, Kansas City, St. Ann, St. Louis, and Valle y Park have enacted such ordinanc es that could be preempted unde r this bill.1923 Supplement or charte r provisions to addre ss this type of lender in the future because such ordinance s or charte r provisions would no t hav e been in e ffect prio r to the effective date of the bill. Because it would erode local control in areas such as zoning that fall square ly fall within the traditio nal police powers of local communitie s, Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No. 866 does not receive my appro val. In accordance with the above stated reasons for disappro val, I am returning Senate Subs titute for Senate Bill No . 866 w ithout my appro val. Respectfully submitte d, /s / Jeremiah W .
