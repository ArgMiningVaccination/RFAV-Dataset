Move beyond the Western approach of focusing solely on the bio - medical concerns of the individual and enhance it by supporting patients in their entire well -being (physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual). Aim to reframe Western health care approaches by providing the opportunity to develop healthy attachments with culture in practice. Indigenous wellness approaches have proven to be successful in achieving individual, family and community wellness and need to be reclaimed and relearned and woven into Western approaches. Lu'ma Medical Centre Indigenizing Team -Based Care Cont'd: Honour the gifts, experience and wisdom of each staff member and community member and refrain from perpetuating the paternalistic, expert -focused approach in service delivery. Ensure that all staff have an understanding of the social determinants that create access barriers to healthcare and be flexible. Create opportunities for ongoing cultural learning & activities for staff. Trust in ones intuitiveness. Staff need to support each other and take time for self -healing.

Lu'ma Medical Centre 8 Strategies : That create the Conditions Indigenous patients need to Improve Health Outcomes. Lu'ma Medical Centre 8 Strategies: 2. AUTHENTIC ENGAGEMENT Patient experience is a Team effort that starts at Reception with staff who is welcoming & friendly, connecting patients to the right people to meet their needs. Healthy team working relationships create Healthy Patient Working Relationships. Practitioners take the time to listen to understand patient experience. Practitioners explain good health practices and teach patients using plain language. Adherence to a medical health plan is improved when the reasoning is explained. Our team engages patients to actively manage health on all levels; helping patients to practice physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health . Patients become confident in themselves and their ability to heal. Lu'ma Medical Centre 3. UPSTREAM SOLUTIONS Our focus is family health in order to support the next generation in being healthy.

Patients are supported to actively manage chronic conditions to reduce acute events. 8 Strategies: Lu'ma Medical Centre 8 Strategies: 4. OPENING DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY We address social determinants of health by connecting patients to opportunities on site in Housing Navigation, Youth Support, Justice, and Cultural Exploration as well as resources, programs and services in the community. Barriers are removed when patients are supported in completing applications, taxes, registrations, and forms so people can connect to resources, programs, and services they need to reach their goals. We have partners in MVAEC (Metro Vancouver Aboriginal Executive Council) with an array of services we connect our patients to: Skills Training, Employment, Education, and more. Lu'ma Medical Centre A Data System is developed with the First Nations & Aboriginal Primary Care Network. Robust data is collected with agreed upon conventions, longitudinal measurement framework for wellness and illness indicators, demographics, and social determinants of patients. The better we understand Indigenous patient health and track longitudinal progress with our model, the better we can demonstrate need for resources to build capacity to meet the needs of the urban Indigenous community. 8 Strategies: 5.

Lu'ma is a Centre of didactic learning and clinical teaching. Quality Improvements are made in clinic and broadly shared with the First Nations & Aboriginal Primary Care Network on knowledge and findings. Lu'ma Medical Centre 8 Strategies: 7. CULTURE IS TREATMENT Mental Health is improved through cultural practices, art, song, ceremony, social, and physical activities that increase social connectivity. Identity Building and Social Inclusion are integral social determinants of health; therefore cultural connections lead to physical and mental wellness. Addressing spiritual and emotional health with cultural ceremony and activities are keys to recovering from trauma and the disassociation of mind, body and spirit prevalent with people with PTSD . Traditional Elders/Healers & Helpers assist patients in re -connecting to cultural practices, activities and teachings. Spiritual approaches help patients connect to ancestors to heal the past and have strength to move forward in wellness. Social Cultural activities & practices increase happiness, wellness, likelihood of success with goals in housing, education, employment, income security, and positive changes in attitude and relationships. Social Cultural activities & practices lead to decrease in anxiety, depression, blood pressure, blood sugar and weight, reduction in ER visits and acute incidents. Lu'ma Medical Centre 8 Strategies: 8. PERMANENCY Patients build permanency in their healthcare relationships. Patients' physical, emotional, spiritual and mental health is supported by an entire team to ensure consistency and continuum of care.
