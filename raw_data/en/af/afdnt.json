P: [716-276-8866](tel:7162768866) F: [716-633-0600](tel:7166330600) Originally from Western New York, my interest in healthcare began at an early age when my mother would take me to her work at a local radiologist's office. Later while completing the exercise science program at UB, I embraced ideas that seemed organic to me: that there is more to health than the absence of pain or disease, the concept of wellness, and the multiple factors that affect total wellness. I felt called to pursue a career that not only involved medicine but emphasized a natural approach to enhance the ability to function overall. My postgraduate education was completed at New York Chiropractic College and the Finger Lakes School of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. Through a study abroad program after graduation I traveled to China to complete an 80 hour internship in Zhenjiang Province Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, where traditional Chinese medicine and biomedicine are practiced under one roof. This was the culmination of an intensive and well-rounded education which embraced values I share: an open-minded approach to individualized and truly integrative patient care. To say that this was the experience of a lifetime would be an understatement! From May 2014 to December 2015 I had the fortunate opportunity to be an associate with an incredible group of chiropractors, massage and rehabilitation therapists at the Sport, Spine and Injury Center of Fredericksburg, Virginia. Invaluable experience was gained here as I worked alongside such a great team treating a wide variety of patients and presentations. I recently relocated back to my hometown and am very excited to work here at Acupuncture Works. Your visits will include intake of subjective and objective information, biomedical and traditional Chinese medical assessment and diagnoses, a full explanation of your condition, the treatment session, and any lifestyle modifications that could help. \"Doctor\" means \"teacher\" and patient education to promote empowerment is of utmost importance to me. \"Chiro\" means \"hand\" and my treatment style is based on the healing power of touch. Should the situation arise, referral to another provider may be warranted as I strongly encourage co-management with other healthcare professionals. It is my goal to not only restore but continually improve wellness by harmonizing the body, mind, spirit with a unique blend of skills learned throughout my education and experience. It is my passion to use chiropractic, tui na: Chinese medical massage, and traditional Chinese medicine to rebalance what has gone astray either recently or over time. It is my pleasure to listen, view you as a whole, determine the root of an issue, and uncover what may be preventing you from living life to the fullest. It is an honor to take care of this community of family and friends. I deeply respect the art, science, and philosophy of traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture and chiropractic as both a practitioner as well as a patient. When I'm not in the office you can find me exploring the outdoors especially on the disc golf course or camping, having a good laugh with my husband and family and friends, enjoying live music, cheering on my beloved Buffalo sports teams, engaging in a daily qigong and yoga practice, and relishing this resurgence of our Queen City.
