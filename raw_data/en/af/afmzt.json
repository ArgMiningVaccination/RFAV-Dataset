It was practiced in ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome. Hippocrates, the father of medicine (460-357 B.C.) strongly advocated natural cures and that food should be our medicine. After training and working as a nurse for several years I decided to become a naturopathic practitioner. After studying alternative medicine I found out that the whole mass of knowledge about natural cures done over the years was later collected under one name, Naturopathy. The credit for the name Naturopathy goes to Dr. Benedict Lust (1872 "}
