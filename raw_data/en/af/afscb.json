[Immunotherapy](../immunotherapy) with [monoclonal antibodies](../monoclonal-antibody), such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. IL-6 is expressed by prostate cancer and within the tumor microenvironment and shown to enhance prostate cancer and disease progression. Treatment with an anti-IL-6 antibody such as tocilizumab may inhibit cancer progression. Giving atezolizumab in combination with etrumadenant or tocilizumab may work better in treating prostate cancer. Official Title An Open-Label Multi-Center Phase II Study of Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab-Based Combination Therapy in Men With Localized Prostate Cancer Prior to Radical Prostatectomy Details PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: - To determine the impact of atezolizumab-based combination therapy on the composition and function of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICS). SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: - To determine the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab-based combination therapy in [localized prostate cancer](../prostate-cancer)(PC). II. To determine the clinical efficacy of atezolizumab-based combination therapy in localized PC. EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES: - To characterize changes in the frequency and number of circulating immune cells following atezolizumab-based combination therapy in localized PC. II. To determine the impact of atezolizumab-based combination therapy on the composition and phenotype of the tumor microenvironment. III. To determine the impact of atezolizumab-based combination therapy on the circulating and intratumoral T cell repertoire. IV. To explore the role of novel imaging modalities to understand the immunologic and clinical impact to immunotherapeutic approaches in localized PC. - To characterize changes in the [gut microbiome](../gut-microbiome)associated with each therapeutic combination. OUTLINE: Patients are assigned sequentially to 1 of 2 groups. COHORT A: Patients receive one cycle of atezolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day 1 of a 14 day cycle prior to radical prostatectomy (RP). COHORT B: Patients will receive 1 cycle of neoadjuvant atezolizumab and etrumadenant (AB928) prior to RP; atezolizumab will be administered in an identical fashion as Cohort A. Etrumadenant will be administered at a dose of 150 mg once daily, until 48 hours prior to RP. COHORT C: Patients will receive 1 cycle of neoadjuvant atezolizumab and tocilizumab prior to RP; atezolizumab will be administered in an identical fashion as Cohort A. Etrumadenant will be administered at a dose of 6mg/kg. Two more groups consisting of treatment with atezolizumab in combination with other drugs may be added in the future. RP will occur 21 days (+/- 7 days) following treatments on Cycle 1 Day 1. No further study therapy will be administered following RP Following RP, subjects will be followed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months (from date of RP), or until disease progression, whichever occurs sooner Keywords Prostate Adenocarcinoma, Prostate Cancer, can join if...
