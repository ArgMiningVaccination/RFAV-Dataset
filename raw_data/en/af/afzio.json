One treatment session typically takes up to 1 hour. The first treatment may take up to 1.5 hours. Please wear comfortable clothing ie. no tight jeans, or similar seamed trousers, as treatments are carried out fully clothed. [ ](#) VHT Bodywork VHT is a safe holistic non-diagnostic body balancing energy discipline consisting of a series of non-invasive procedures performed over connective soft tissue, enabling healing and promoting well being. It is a trigger point release modality in that work is done over specific trigger points releasing the trauma in them. [ ](http://kinesiology) Kinesiology Kinesiology is a holistic approach to address imbalances and rebalance the body it works on every aspect of health, the physical, psychological, emotional, nutritional and spiritual levels, to identify and relieve the stress which may be preventing the individual from enjoying excellent health and to work towards optimal health and well-being. It uses muscle response testing to measure the motor response of the central nervous system to a sensory challenge. [ ](#) Sound Healing Sound has been utilised as a tool for healing in various cultures for thousands of years. The various techniques all have the same intention: to move us from a place of imbalance to equilibrium. With a background in Sound Engineering & as a musician, I have always known the healing capacity/ power of sound and music. During a sound healing session I use a combination of Tuning forks, a Gong, Crystal, Tibetan and Nepalese singing bowls. [ ](#) Balancing The Chakras are energy centres within the body, that affect the body on a physical level. Each Chakra represents organs and systems within the body such as the circulatory and endocrine systems and affect specific areas within the body. This is why addressing and rebalancing these energy centres on a physical level is so important. The body will not function correctly, even if only one Chakra is out of alignment, because all of the energy centres are related and therefore will be affected. [ ](#) Healing Healing can be beneficial to sufferers of any form of disease or illness. This form of healing is often used to complement other forms of treatment the patient may be receiving from a GP. It can help to eliminate pain, to reduce stress and anxiety. However, it goes beyond securing physical improvement. It's aim is to bring into harmony your spirit, mind and body, so that you may lead a full, healthy and happy life. I am a fully qualified Duchy Healer, upon completion of two years training, along with Reiki. [ ](#) Tai Chi & Qi Gong Tai Chi Qigong Shibashi is a gentle, beautiful and flowing Qigong exercise routine that is both a joy to practice and deeply relaxing. It is designed to improve the general health and wellbeing of the practitioner. The gentle rocking motions and stretching movements improve circulation and digestion. The chest exercises and controlled breathing are good for lung conditions and asthma. The overall effect of the exercise is to reduce mental stress and physical tension carried in the muscles of the body. This Qigong is very effective and easy to learn. The gentle movements are suitable for people of all ages as it does not put too much stress on muscles and joints and can be practiced sitting or standing. [ ](#) Homeobotanicals Homeobotanicals: are a powerful, synergistic blends of organic herbal combinations in liquid form, dynamised and selectively chosen to target specific organs and systems in our body. These wholistic remedies assist to clean out our body of all toxins ingested, inhaled and absorbed, leaving our body capable of functioning more efficiently. They are balancers, so rather than impose anything on the body, the lovely herbs in these blends, bring our body back into balance and support the organs and systems so we can regain health. Release your toxic burden now with Hb's. [ ](#) The Emotion Code The Emotion Code: is designed to help you alleviate physical discomfort, ease emotional wounds, and restore love to relationships. A very simple, yet powerful technique. Our premise is that the wisdom of the body is not held in the conscious, active mind, but in the subconscious mind, where the record of every experience, thought, feeling, or memory you've ever had is stored. We believe the subconscious mind exerts an unseen yet profound influence over how we behave and feel \u2014 and it's also keenly aware of exactly what your body needs to get well. It's our belief that to access these vast stores of knowledge, we need to bypass the conscious mind and speak directly to the subconscious.

Appointments Testimonials When I first came to see Liz I was unable to walk at all. I had 2 splints on my legs and a stick, I now just have an elasticated strap on my ankle and very occasionally use a stick. I had a huge list of prescription drugs including Oramorph, Steroids and Gabapentin, I'm no longer on any of these and down to a couple of tablets a day. Liz is one extremely talented lady....Totally amazing!!! She has not only helped me physically but mentally too!! Managing with Congenital Hip disorder in both hips, having multiple surgeries & rehabilitation... I not long after developed a Rare Neurological disease... Some days are good, some days not as good, each day presenting a challenge! I was lucky enough for a friend to introduce me to Liz, I cannot put into words how much she has helped me, not only does she make you feel at ease... Liz makes you smile too!! Plus I am back in the surf where I belong An absolute star!! You have helped me beyond measure Thank you for putting me together again Xx I've been mentally trying to write a review for ages but the I've really struggled to put it all into words. I have had a few 'treatments' with Liz for various reasons. From mental and emotional health and well being healing to releasing physical pain Liz just 'does it'! I'm not sure what she does but it just works. She takes away all of the negativity. I've had many holistic therapy treatments over the years but Liz's is different. It's non evasive, gentle and I feel relaxed and comforted at all times and never feel rushed. It's like counselling therapy and massage all in one and I'm left totally 'zoned out' and what I can only describe as a meditative state.........totally chilled out and relaxed......yet energised! Liz really listens and tailors the treatment to suit, dealing with the 'whole person'. She really understands what's going on and what you need to be balanced/grounded. For anyone that suffers from pain you'll know how exhausting it can be! I can't recommend Liz enough. I've had brilliant treatment for neck/shoulder and back pain. She'll work until the tension/pain goes away! Such a relief! Liz works wonders with stress! No idea how....but it just disappears! It's amazing! Liz knows when I need a treatment sometimes before I do! Liz not only has a natural gift/talent but she is well read, qualified and experienced to deliver various therapies to suit different needs She even travelled overseas to achieve her latest qualification! She really knows her stuff! It's impressive! I can't thank Liz enough for all that she does to make me feel better! I am 34, a full time electronics engineer, and I have grown up in the physical world, in computers, in logic and in what can be proven by the scientific method. Yep - you've got it, the stereotypical opposite to someone writing a five star review for a holistic therapist. Via certain personal experiences in my life and through curiosity and research, throughout the last decade or so I have grown to believe there is much more going on than I once thought was possible. However this is science - I believe, and traditional scientists are now beginning to catch up, through study into quantum theories and so-forth. It is however up to the individual how little or how much they want to believe themselves at whatever level, because Liz is highly qualified and experienced in working within traditional and alternative environments she bridges the gap between the two. In my case starting out with things that just made sense such as recommendations for improvements with diet, exercise, making time for relaxation and self-care, etc. Holistic balancing, for me was one of the 'kicks' that made me feel natural after the therapy - apart from the process itself improving my state of mind at the time and for days afterwards - it gave me the insight into what I could feel like all the time if I put into practice what Liz had recommended specifically for me, which could well be different for you depending on your individual circumstances. You have nothing to lose and potentially a lot to gain from a visit to Liz Liz has helped me many times, I can't thank her enough- and I cannot explain exactly what she does- except that its like magic and it works! When suffering from the most excruciating back pain recently, all that was required was for me to sit in a chair and close my eyes, I then laid down on a couch and with the lightness of touch Liz worked on my body. I can honestly say I couldn't believe how I felt afterwards, I continued my day pain free! Liz has a true healing gift and I am so grateful to know her! I have had several treatments from Liz, and I have always found these to be extremely effective, whether for physical or for emotional imbalances. I've been rendered speechless on more than one occasion by the amazing results of Liz's work; the immediate and dramatic relief of pain! Liz is a very gifted healer, very down to earth, and always puts you at ease, she works very hard to ensure that her clients receive the best healing possible, and will always tailor her treatments according to their current needs. The treatments are relaxing and held in comfortable surroundings. Liz has great skill and ability to heal, I would recommend her very highly indeed. I've had a few different treatments from Liz and all have felt wonderful. Liz sorted out a nagging shoulder injury for or me in two sessions and the pain has never returned. Having Liz balance my energies felt so relaxing, and left me walking on air. I would recommend her to anyone. Liz is everything you could want in a practitioner, professional, knowledgeable, down to earth and very intuitive. Whether you've never taken that step to have holistic healing or if you're a therapist yourself you'll find Liz has the skill and compassion to help. I have had many treatments by Liz , for many years I have sufferered crippling neck pain , after every session I feel so much better and more balanced . Amazing will be booking again. I am 55 & have had many different treatments over the years however during & after being treated by Liz I felt an overwhelming sense of wellbeing that no medication could possibly provide. Liz is so full of knowledge & is exceptionally professional furthermore you feel instantly relaxed when in her presence as she heals your body, mind & soul . I highly recommend you visit Liz for whatever reason she will change your outlook on life an enable you to live it to its full potential. Miraculous! I wasn't aware of holistic balancing before I met Liz and had no idea whether it would help me but went with it and I am so happy I did. I broke my arm quite badly and was in a full cast for 2 months and then was told I needed surgery. Surgery was the easy part, the problems were obvious once the surgery had healed. I had no movement in my wrist, a siezed elbow and shoulder and the pain was unbearable. Within the first hour of treatment I can honestly say I was able to flex my wrist downwards and there was some movement upwards. The pain subsided so much that I stopped taking painkillers and day by day my wrist improved. I asked for a second visit as my shoulder was still very painful and again there was a huge improvement in my range of movements. This had not been achieved at all through physio and a steroid injection was talked about which I was hoping to avoid at all costs. I now feel I am not destined for a year long recovery as advised but more a matter of weeks. You truly have a gift Liz and I hope anyone else suffering as I was will find you. Relieved and thankful. Karin x My 10 year old Jack Russel, Barney, suffered double cruciate ligament tears about three years ago which healed fairly well naturally however he never regained full mobility, especially in jumping and running and I'd assumed he never would...until we met Liz! Liz noticed immediately that Barney's back was out and got straight to work. Barney seemed very relaxed, sitting quietly and willingly during the treatment with no signs of discomfort. Afterwards Barney seemed much more flexible and bouncy and very much happier. The next morning Barney's overall mobility was so much better that he pretty much ran the whole way round our walk. I had a job to keep up! On arrival for the second treatment, Barney walked straight to Liz and sat down in front of her ready for his treatment to begin. He absolutely loved it and Liz got a little kiss from him afterwards to say thank you. Since then Barney has been glowing. He seems younger and almost back to his former self before the cruciate ligament tears. Today he jumped the fallen tree I usually lift him over and is still tanking along with the other dogs. His fitness (and my own) has increased with the extra movement he now has. I can't express how highly I recommend Liz for Canine healing and balancing. Liz creates a warm, calm and relaxing atmosphere that I'm certain would settle most dogs and has a natural intuitive sense and an amazing knowledge of physiology. My only wish is that we'd found her sooner! I wasn't sure 100% what kind of practice I was going to experience, but i was in quite a bit of pain and just very open minded to anything that might help! Liz made me feel very comfortable and I was right to be open minded because i finished the session feeling like a new woman but not completely sure how exactly liz had made such a difference without being so hands on like the usual massage i go to when i am in pain. There was no pain and feeling sluggish afterwards like I usually experience with a sports massage, but i really did feel so much looser and in a lot less pain.... I even went surfing later than afternoon! I can't recommend Liz and the practice of VHT enough and I am stoked that Liz is keen to start running some sessions from my SurfHouse! Watch this space Thank you Liz! X I don't know where to start..... Liz is one of a kind! She's friendly, warm, funny very kind and most importantly extremely clever in what she does! She's magic! Liz has worked many times on me for all sorts of problems and every time I'm astonished with how amazing I feel after! My son has quite bad asthma and along with his inhalers Liz has done numerous workings on him and I'm amazed at how much better he has been. A child who was in hospital every two weeks for a long time with bad attacks, hasn't been hospitalised for 9 months! I think everyone will agree that says everything you need to know about Liz! Please see my amazing talented friend, she will have "}
