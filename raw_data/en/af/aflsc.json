Whilst the medicine cabinet is often our first port of call to tackle the dreaded hangover, we urge you to follow these simple steps and opt for a natural remedy for your hangover. So, how do you feel? Is your head pounding, are you nauseous or is your battery empty? Delve into your Aromatherapy Kit to help you feel yourself again... Headache Buster: For this, you need look no further than [Lavender](https://www.tisserand.com/aromatherapy/lavender-ethically-harvested-pure-essential-oil-9ml/) and [Peppermint](https://www.tisserand.com/aromatherapy/peppermint-organic-pure-essential-oil-9ml/) essential oils, which can reduce symptoms, duration, or severity of headaches when inhaled. 5 drops of Lavender and 2 drops of peppermint into a diffuser will soon leave you feeling brighter and ready to tackle the day ahead.

Why not pop our [Mind Clear Pulse Point Roller Ball](https://www.tisserand.com/aromatherapy-roller-balls/mind-clear-pulse-point-roller-ball/) into your pocket, to soothe your sore head on the go.
