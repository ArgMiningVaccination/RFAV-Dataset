Treat imbalances naturally, using ancient wisdom for your modern needs.", "sitename": "Krystal Kinnunen", "date": "2006-01-01", "cleaned_text": "individual while respecting the body's innate wisdom. She understands that illness is merely an imbalance in the body, and utilizes the safe, natural, drug-free modality of acupuncture to help bring your body back to its natural state of wholeness. Krystal spent years studying over 365 acupuncture points and 5 different meridian systems to help each individual. She is the sacred space holder for your healing to occur, drawing on ancient knowledge and practices, but understanding that the healing really comes from within you. How Does Acupuncture Work? Krystal likes to explain how acupuncture works by reflecting on the natural world. When a creek or river is stopped up by fallen trees or the work of beavers, it causes a blockage in the flow of water. Often times, the water in this area will stagnate and begin to collect debris. Likewise, when our body's waterways have some sort of blockage, stagnation occurs which creates an imbalance. Acupuncture helps reset the body's natural energy flow by using thin needles in specific points that communicate with the body, so it can clear the blockage naturally and bring itself back to a free flowing healthy state of homeostasis. Studies with MRI scans have shown that Acupuncture stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system and releases endorphins during a session. It has been proven to turn off the pain arc response and turn on the natural opioid response in the brain. It can also balances the hormones in the body. What Can Acupuncture Treat? Anything and everything, from chronic pain, allergies and asthma to depression and grief, and even the common cold. Krystal has chosen to focus on women's health with a speciality in fertility and pregnancy. What to expect at your first visit In your initial session, you and Krystal will spend 1.5 to 2 hours together in order to conduct a thorough intake and a full treatment. Chinese Medicine treats the whole person using an individualized approach, so even though you may be coming in for a specific issue, you will be asked many questions regarding digestion, energy, emotional state and sleep. Krystal will then take your pulse and examine your tongue. The pulse reading is done with 3 fingers on the wrist giving clues to 6 different organ systems. This helps her to understand where there may be imbalances. The tongue also gives clues, as it can be \"read\" like a map of the internal body organ system. Krystal will then come up with an individualized treatment plan for you. In addition to acupuncture, the plan may also include Chinese herbs, moxibustion, cupping, gua sha, Chinese dietary therapy, essential oils, stone medicine, sound healing, or other modalities that may be appropriate for you. What is unique about receiving acupuncture from Krystal in Asheville, NC? Krystal's multidisciplinary background and wealth of holistic healing experience allows her to incorporate a unique variety of treatments in addition to regular acupuncture. In particular, she loves using stone medicine, sound healing, and energy healing. Stone Medicine: Stone medicine could easily be judged and dismissed as too \"woo woo\" or \"New Age-y.\" However, it's been a fundamental part of Chinese Medicine since the beginning of its rich ancient history. In a culture immersed in the observation of the natural world, the unique energies of stones and minerals were regarded with reverence. Stones work on the Juan level, which is the deepest part of who we are\u2014our DNA, or the level of the Bones. They work on the level of the unconscious. This is where our \"curriculum\" for life is contained. Sound Healing: Did you know that sound affects more than just your ears? Vibrations from sounds can affect the entire body at a cellular level, including your nervous system, deep tissue, and skeletal structure. The ancient art of sound healing uses beneficial sound frequencies to assist the body and mind in returning to a balanced, healthy and harmonious state. Krystal may play the gong, crystal bowl, chimes, or sing as part of your treatment. Energy healing: We are all more than just physical bodies on the Earth plane. Ancient medicine systems and modern science alike understand that there is more to physical matter than what we can detect with our five senses. Energy healing works from the perspective that a living being is multidimensional, and the flow of energy through the body can be balanced and restored through various techniques. Krystal is a Reiki Master and has also been trained in Soul Focused Healing, two modalities that work in tandem with acupuncture to facilitate your wellness.
