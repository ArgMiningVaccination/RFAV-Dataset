Health plans are required to have enough providers in their network to ensure that members have access to network providers. To ensure there are enough provider types in UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN network, UW Medicine ACN uses certain, but not all, providers contracted with Regence BlueShield . This is called the support network. Support network \u2014 the support network includes certain providers contracted with Regence to supplement the Core network and ensure network adequacy. Most of the providers in this network are specialty providers (see page 19 for examples of support providers). Naturopaths are considered PCPs. You pay 15 percent for most covered services. These providers cannot bill you for char ges above the allowed amount. If you select a naturopath as your PCP, you pay $0 for most covered services. The plan pays 100 percent of the allowed amount.

Network consent for out- of-network services An approve d network consent allows the plan to pay for services provided by an out -of-network provider at the network rate. If the network approves a network consent, the plan pays at the network rate (85 percent of the allowed amount) for services received from an out- of-network provider. An out -of-network consent must be submitted and approved prior to the service being performed. When and how to request a network consent ALERT! If the network approves a network consent, you must still pay your cost -share for most medical services. Services provided under an approved network consent apply to your medical deductible and out- of-pocket limit. Network consent for ongoing services may require periodic review. When your network provider affiliated with UMP Plus- UW Medicine ACN determines you need medically necessary services not available within your UMP Plus -UW Medicine AC N network, that provider submits a network consent request to the network for consideration by calling UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN Customer Service at 1-888-402-4238 (TRS: 711) or UMP Customer Service at 1- 800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) . If they approve the network consent, the network will fax it to the plan before the services are provided. The fact that a provider may prescribe or provide a service or supply does not, by itself, make it a medically necessary covered service or supply . The network consent must include the following: Information about the out -of-network provide r and/or facility, such as name, address, and Tax ID number (TIN). The dates of service for which your UMP Plus- UW Medicine ACN network provider is requesting network consent. When preauthorization is required with network consent The services you receive through network consent may also require UMP preauthorization. In that case, your network provider affiliated with UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN must include information relevant to both the network consent and the UMP preauthorization request: The information about the out -of-network provider and/or facility listed in the previous section; and Clinical documentation needed for the plan to review services for medical necessity.

For an out -of-network facility, when you receive emergency services you pay the network cost -sharing amount regardless of the network status of the provider or facility and cannot be balance billed. Out-of-area services Any area outside of Washington State is considered outside of Regence service area, as defined on page 160. Regence BlueShield has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensees referred to generally as \"BlueCard\u00ae Programs.\" Whenever you obtain health care services outside of Regence's service area, the claims for these services may be processed through one of these BlueCard\u00ae Programs, and may include negotiated National Account arrangements available between Regence and other Blue Cross and Blue Shield Licensees. Typically, when accessing care outside of Regence's service area, you will obtain care from health care providers that have a contractual agreement with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geographic area (as Host Blue). In some instances, you may obtain care from out -of-network providers. Regence's payment practices in both instances are described on page 25. BlueCard\u00ae Program Under the BlueCard\u00ae Program, when you acces s covered services within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, Regence will remain responsible for fulfilling contractual obligations. However, the Host Blue is responsible for contracting with and generally handling all interactions with its network providers. Whenever you access covered services outside Regence's service area and the claim is processed through the BlueCard\u00ae Program, the amount you pay for covered services is calculated based on the lower of: The billed covered charges for your covered services; or The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to Regence. 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 25 Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to your health care provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated p rice that considers special arrangements with your health care provider or provider group that may include types of settlements, incentive payments, and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of health care providers after considering the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. Laws in a small number of states may require the Host Blue to add a surcharge to your calculation. If any state laws mandate other liability calculation methods, including a surcharge, Regence would then calculate your liability for any covered services according to applicable law. Inter -Plan Programs: Federal or state taxes, surcharges, or fees Federal law or state law may require a surcharge, tax or other fee that applies to self -insured accounts. If applicable, any such surcharge, tax or other fee will be included as part of the claim fee passed on to the claimant. Negotiated National Account arrangements As an alternative to the BlueCard\u00ae Program, your claims for covered services may be processed through a negotiated National Account arrangement with a Host Blue. The amount you pay for covered services under this arrangement will be calculated based on the lower of either billed covered charges or a negotiated price (refer to the description of negotiated price above) made available to Regence by the Host Blue. Out-of-network providers outside Regence's service area Member Liability Calculation. When covered services are provided outside of Regence's service area by out-of-network providers, the amount you pay for such services will generally be based on either the Host Blue's out -of-network provider local payment or the pricing arrangements required by applica ble state law. In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the amount that the out -of-network provider bills and the payment Regence will make for the covered services as set forth in this paragraph. Exceptions. In certain situations, Regence may use other payment bases. such as billed covered charges, the payment Regence would make if the health care services had been obtained within Regence's service area, or a special negotiated payment, as permitted under Inter -Plan Programs Polici es, to determine the amount Regence will pay for services rendered by out -of-network providers. In these situations, you may be liable for the difference between the amount that the out -of-network provider bills and the payment Regence will make for the co vered services as set forth in this paragraph. Services received outside the United States ALERT! The plan does not cover prescription drugs ordered through mail -order pharmacies located outside the U.S. See \"Prescription drugs purchased outside the U.S.\" on page 85 to learn more. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core If you are outside the U.S., you may be able to take advantage of Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core when accessing covered health services. Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae Core is unlike the BlueCard\u00ae Program available in the U.S. in certain ways. For instance, although the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00ae 26 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Core assists you with accessing a network of inpatient, outpatient, and professional providers, the network is not served by a Host Blue.

However, if you paid in full at the time of services, you must submit a claim to receive reimbursement for covered health care services. Outpatient services Physicians, urgent care centers, and other outpatient providers located outside the U.S. will typically require you to pay in full at the time of services.

What you pay for medical services Deductible A deductible is a fixed do llar amount you pay each calendar year before the plan begins paying for covered services. The medical deductible amount is $125 per member, with a maximum of $375 per family. When you first get services, you pay the first $125 in charges. After you pay that first $125, the plan begins to pay for covered services. This applies to each covered member, up to the $375 maximum. The medical deductible applies to all services unless otherwise stated in this COC. See below for services that are exempt from the med ical deductible. Services apply to the UMP medical deductible in the order claims are received, not necessarily in the order the member receives the services. ALERT! If you receive services with a benefit limit (such as physical therapy) before meeting your medical deductible, those visits still apply to the benefit limit. For example, if you pay out of pocket for a physical therapy visit because you have not met your medical deductible, that visit will apply to the maximum of 60 visits per calendar year. See definition of \"Limited benefit\" for more information. If you earned the SmartHealth wellness incentive Eligible subscribers can qualify for a $125 reduction in their 2022 SEBB medical plan deductible. If you qualified in 2021, your medical deductible w ill be reduced by $125 in January 2022. More details on eligibility and program requirements are on HCA's SmartHealth webpage at hca.wa.gov/sebb-smarthealth. 28 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage What does not count toward your medical de ductible The following out -of-pocket expenses do not count toward your $125 medical deductible: Charges for service visits over benefit limits. For example, the annual benefit limit for physical therapy is 60 visits. Costs for more than 60 visits are not c overed by the plan, and do not count toward your medical deductible. Charges for services over benefit maximums. Charges over this amount do not apply to your medical deductible. Out- of-network provider charges above the allowed amount (see table on page 22). Prescription drug costs. Services that are exempt from the medical deductible, even if you had out -of-pocket costs. For example, covered preventive care received from an out -of-network provider. Services you pay for that are not covered by the plan (see the \"What the plan does not cover\" section ). Your emergency room copay. Your inpatient hospital copay. Your chiropractor copay. Your acupuncture copay. Your massage therapy copay. Services exempt from the medical deductible The plan pays the allowed amount for the services listed below , subject to cost -share, even if you have not met your medical deductible. When you see a network provider, you do not have to meet your medical deductible before the plan pays for these services: Covered contraceptive supplies and services (see the \"Family planning services\" ben efit). Covered preventive care, including covered immunizations. Diabetes Control Program. Diabetes Prevention Program. Prescription drugs. Routine hearing exams. Hearing aids (you pay $0 and the plan pays 100 percent). Second opinions required by the pla n. Tobacco cessation services. How the medical deductible works with dependents If your family has three or fewer members enrolled, the medical deductible amount is $125 per member, with a maximum of $375. Once a member pays their $125 deductible, the plan begins paying for covered services for that member. Because the plan is now paying for this member's covered services, they are no longer contributing toward the family deductible. Once the family deductible has been met, the plan begins paying for all co vered services. If your family has four or more members enrolled, each member has a medical deductible of $125 and the maximum the family pays toward medical deductibles is $375. Once a member pays their $125 deductible, the plan begins paying for covered services for that member. Because the plan is now paying 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 29 for this member's covered services, they are no longer contributing toward the family deductible. Once the family deductible has been met, the plan begins paying for all covered services for all enrolled family members, even if some have not met their own deductible. If the subscriber earned the SmartHealth wellness incentive for the 202 2 plan year, the subscriber's medical deductible is reduced. See the \"If you earned the SmartHealth wellness incent ive\" section above to learn more. Note: Only services that are covered and are subject to the medical deductible count toward the deductible. See page 28 for a list of services that do not count toward the medical deductible. Coinsurance TIP: Allowed amount is the most the plan pays for a specific covered service or supply. Out- of- network providers may charge more than this amount, and you are responsible for paying the difference between the billed amount and the allowed amount. This is called balance billing. Coinsurance is the percentage of the allowed amount you pay for most medical services and for prescription drugs when the plan pays less than 100 percent. Afte r you meet your medical deductible, you pay the percentages described below for most covered medical services. See pages 77- 81 for how much you pay for prescription drugs. For primary care providers in the core network: You pay nothing for office visits. You may pay 15 percent of the allowed amount for other services not consid ered preventive (see the \"Preventive care\" benefit ) that you may receive (like labs and x -rays) during a primary care office visit after you meet your medical deductible. For specialty providers in the core or support networks: You pay 15 percent of the allowed amount after you meet your medical deductible. For out -of-network providers: You pay 50 percent of the allowed amount after you meet your medical deductible and the provider may balance bill you, which means you will pay any amount an out-of-network provider bills that is above the allowed amount. Professional charges, such as for physician services while you are in the hospital or lab work, may be billed separately. Note: At a network facility, w hen you receive surgery, a nesthesia, pathology, radiology, laboratory, or hospitalist services from an out-of-network provider at a network hospital or network ambulatory surgical facility in Washington, you cannot be balance billed. At an out -of-network facility, w hen you receive emergency services you pay the network cost -sharing amount regardless of the network status of the provider or facility and cannot be balance billed. See page 18 fo r a description of the different provider types. Visit the UMP provider search at ump.regence.com/go/SEBB/UMP- Plus-UWMACN to search a complete list of UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN providers, includ ing out -of-network providers. You can also confirm a provider's network status by calling UMP Customer Service at 1- 800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) . Copay A copay is a set dollar amount you pay when you receive services, treatments, or supplies, including, but not limited to: Emergency room copay: $75 per visit. See the \"Emergency room\" benefit for details. 30 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Facility charges for services received while an inpatient at a hospital, or mental health, skilled nursing, or substance use disorder facility : $200 per day (see \"Inpatient copay\" below). Covered chiropractic, acupuncture, and massage services when you see a network provider will have a $15 copay per visit. The copay for these services will apply toward the annual out -of-pocket maximums. See th e \"Spinal and extremity manipulations\" benefit, and Inpatient copay The inpatient copay of $200 per day is what you pay for inpatient services at a network facility, such as a hospital, or mental health, skilled nursing, or substance use disorder facility. You and your enrolled dependents pay up to $600 maximum per enrolled member per calendar year. The inpatient copay does not apply to your medical deductible but does apply to your medical out -of- pocket limit. Note: Professional charges, such as lab work or provider services, while you are in the hospital may be billed separately and are not included in this copay. When you pay Most of the time, you pay after your claim is processed. You will receive an Explanation of Benefits (EOB) from the plan that explains how much the plan paid the provider. The Member Responsibility section of your EOB tells you how much you owe the provider. The provider sends you a bill. You pay the provider. Note: A provider may ask you to pay your deductible and copay, when applicable, at the time of service. When this happens, check your EOB to make sure the amount you paid is accurately reflected in the Member Responsibility section. Call UMP Customer Service at 1- 800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) with questions. Medical out- of-pocket limit ALERT! Prescription drug costs do not apply to your medical out- of-pocket limit (see below ). The medical out -of-pocket limit is the most you pay during a calendar year for covered services from network providers. After you meet your medical out -of-pocket limit for the year, the plan pays for covered services by network providers at 100 percent of the allowed amount. The plan will not pay more than the allowed amount. Expenses are c ounted from January 1, 2022 , or your first day of enrollment (whichever is later) through December 31, 202 2, or your last day of enrollment (whichever is earlier). Your medical out -of-pocket limit is $2,000 per member and $4,000 per family. Subscribers can change health plans mid -year during a special open enrollment (SOE) if they experience certain qualifying events. When a subscriber enrolled in a SEBB Program UMP plan changes their enrollment to another SEBB Program UMP plan during an SOE, the amounts already accrued toward insurance accumulators will transfer to the new UMP plan. This includes any copay, coinsurance, deductible, and other health care costs outside of the monthly premium payment as well as visit limits . Insurance accumulators do not tra nsfer when a subscriber switches from a SEBB Program UMP plan to a PEBB program UMP plan. If you have questions, call UMP Customer Service at 1 -800-628-3481 (TRS: 711). 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 31 What counts toward this limit Inpatient and emergency room copays Your coinsurance paid to core network, support network, and other providers approved for certain services Your medical deductible Chiropractic, acupuncture, and massage therapy visit copays What does not count toward this limit A.

If you have more than 24 acupuncture visits in one year, you will pay in full for those visits, and what you pay will not count toward this limit. What you pay after reaching this limit You are still responsible for paying C through H (above) after you meet your medical out- of-pocket limit. See page 80 for how the prescription drug out -of-pocket limit works. You still pay for out- of-network provider services Even after you meet your medical out- of-pocket limit, you still pay 50 per cent coinsurance for out- of- network provider services. Out -of-network providers may balance bill you. Note: The 50 percent coinsurance you pay to an out -of-network provider, and any balance billed amounts, do not count toward your medical out -of-pocket limit. Balance billed amounts never apply toward your medical deductible or out -of-pocket limit. Additional exception for approved network consent services In addition to the services listed in the \"What does not count toward this limit\" section above , your coinsurance for out- of-network provider services related to an approved network consent (see page 23) will apply to your medical out -of-pocket limit, and the plan will pay 100 percent of the allowed amount for these services after you meet your medical out -of-pocket limit.

The service or supply must: Be listed as covered; and Be medically necessary; and 36 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Be received by a member on a day between the date coverage begins (but no sooner than January 1, 202 2) and the date coverage ends (but no later tha n December 31, 2022 ); and Have been determined to be a covered benefit by the Health Technology Clinical Committee (HTCC), if reviewed by the HTCC, and, if determined to be covered with conditions, meet the conditions of coverage established by the HTCC (see page 37); and Meet the plan's coverage policies and preauthorization requirements. Limits and exclusions may apply to plan benefits. See both the benefit description and the \"What the plan does not c over\" section. Some services require preauthorization and/or notice before you receive treatment.

UMP Plus is a self -insured ACP. UMP is offered through the Washington State Health Care Authority's School Employees Benefits Board ( SEBB) Program . UMP is administered by Regence BlueShield, and Washington State Rx Services (WSRxS). All prescription drugs, services, or other benefit chan ges may require approval by the SEB Board. Approval takes place when benefits are procured for the next calendar year. For example, prescription drugs newly approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may require approval by the SEB Board before the plan will cover them. Health Technology Clinical Committee (HTCC) ALERT! HTCC determinations may be implemented by the plan at any time during the calendar year, but are often implemented the January following the HTCC's decision. HTCC decisions are posted on the HCA website at hca.wa.gov/hta . Contact UMP Customer Service if you have questions about specific services that the HTCC has reviewed. Created by Washington State law Chapter 70.14 RCW (Revised Code of Washington), the HTCC is a committee of 11 independent health care professionals that reviews selected health technologies (services) to determine appropriate coverage, if any, for the services. These may include medical or surgical devices and procedures, medical equipment, and diagnostic tests. In public meetings, the HTCC considers public comments and scientific evidence regarding the safety, medical effectiveness, and cost -effectiveness of the services when making its determination. How HTCC decisions affect UMP benefits Under state law, the plan must comply with HTCC decisions , Chapter 70.14.120(1)(a) RCW (Revised Code of Washington), unless such determination conflicts with federal or state law . Services reviewed by the HTCC are either covered, covered with conditions, or not covered. The HTCC determines the conditions, if any, under which the service will be included as a covered benefit and, if covered, the criteria the pla n must use to decide whether the service is medically necessary. Criteria established by the HTCC take precedence over Regence's medical policies. When the HTCC determines that a service is not covered, then the service is not covered by the plan. Some HTCC decisions include a requirement to follow FDA or 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 37 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines. You may review these guidelines on the FDA website at fda.gov or CMS web site at cms.gov . Where to find HTCC decisions This COC contains a list of HTCC decisions by topic and coverage level. You may view the list of services that the HTCC has reviewed or currently has under review on the HCA website at hca.wa.gov/hta .

Preferred drugs Preferred drugs, including preferred specialty drugs, have been reviewe d by the Washington State Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committee or by WSRxS for HCA, and found to be safe and clinically effective when compared to other drugs in the same therapeutic class or category. HCA or WSRxS has found these drugs to be among the most cost -effective drugs for their therapeutic class or category due to their favorable pricing. Noncovered prescription drugs Noncovered prescription drugs are not covered unless a Preferred Drug List exception is requested and approved. These prescrip tion drugs have been reviewed by WSRxS. They are not as cost -effective and do not have a clinically significant therapeutic advantage over the Preferred Drug List alternative(s).

When a generic equivalent for a brand -name prescription drug becomes available, the brand -name dr ug immediately becomes noncovered. Always ask your doctor to allow substitution on your prescriptions to save you money. How UMP decides which prescription drugs are preferred Washington State P&T Committee and WSRxS P&T Committee provide recommendations to HCA. WSRxS and HCA review the recommendations and determine which medications are included in the formulary, as well as the tier level. The UMP Preferred Drug List includes the committees' coverage recommendations. Not all prescription drug classes are reviewed by the Washington State P&T Committee. For these prescription drugs, the WSRxS P&T Committee makes coverage recommendations for HCA's review and final determination of a drug's tier level. For the plan to cover a prescription drug for you, it must be medically necessary for your health condition. Your provider may prescribe a drug or drug dosage that does not meet the plan's definition of medically necessary and therefore will not be covered . ALERT! A prescription drug may be noncovered even if no generic equivalent is available. See page 81 for how you may request an exception. What you pay for prescription drugs The amount you pay for your prescription depends on the prescription drug's tier and where you purchase your prescriptions. The UMP Preferred Drug List classifies prescription drugs into four tiers: Preventive Tier (P): Preventive drugs required under PPACA or recommended by the U.S. Preventive Servic es Task Force and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the CDC. Value Tier (V): Specific high -value prescription drugs used to treat certain chronic conditions. Tier 1 (1): Primarily low -cost generic prescription drugs. Tier 2 (2): Preferred brand -name drugs and high -cost generic prescription drugs. You pay $0 for P reventive Tier prescription drugs. The plan pays 100 percent of the allowed amount. In general, Value Tier and Tier 1 drugs cost you less money than Tier 2, which are more expensiv e. You may find a prescription drug's tier by searching the UMP Preferred Drug List on the UMP website at ump.regence.com/sebb/benefits/prescriptions or by calling WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361- 1611 (TRS: 711). You may purchase up to a 90-day supply for most prescription drugs. For the majority of specialty drugs, you may purchase up to a 30 -day supply. To check your cost, do either of the following: Use the Drug Price Check tool on the UMP website at ump.regence.com/sebb/benefits/prescriptions. Call WSRxS Customer Service at 1- 888-361-1611 (TRS: 711). See the table on page 78 for how much you pay for each of the prescription drug tiers. Using Value Tier and Tier 1 drugs reduces prescription costs for both you and the plan. Generic drugs, follow- on biologics, 78 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage and biosimilars have the same active ingredient as their brand -name counterparts and are usually less expensive.

If your exception request is denied, the plan's response letter will include the reason for the denial and the steps you can take next. Preferred drug list exceptions and coverage determinations are based on medical necessity. Because requesting a noncovered drug exception requires medical information, only your prescribing provider may submit the request. The prescribing provider will need to provide WSRxS with the following information: The prescribing provider's contact information; An explanation of why the plan should grant an exception; An explanation of how the requested medication therapy is evidence -based and generally accepted medical practice; Documentation of medical necessity for the requested prescription drug over all other preferred products (Value Tier, Tier 1, and Tier 2); and At least one of the following items must also be included with the exception request: Confirmatio n and documentation from your prescribing provider that all preferred therapeutic alternatives (Value Tier, Tier 1, and Tier 2) were tried for a clinically appropriate duration of treatment and failed to produce a therapeutic response. If the requested exc eption is for a brand -name prescription drug that has an FDA -approved generic equivalent, your prescribing provider must 82 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage document your inadequate response to at least two manufacturers of the generic drug, or to all manufacturers of the generic drug if the re are fewer than two manufacturers, in addition to all other preferred therapeutic alternatives, before an exception is granted; or Confirmation and documentation from your prescribing provider that all preferred therapeutic alternatives (Value Tier, Tier 1, and Tier 2), including the required number of manufacturers of the same generic prescription drug, caused an adverse drug reactio n that prevents you from taking the prescription drug as directed. If the requested exception is for a brand -name prescription drug that has an FDA -approved generic equivalent, your prescribing provider must document your adverse drug reaction to at least two manufacturers of the generic drug, or to all manufacturers of the generic drug if there are fewer than two manufacturers, in addition to all other preferred therapeutic alternatives, before an exception is granted. ALERT! The exception process for nonc overed drugs cannot be used for drugs that UMP excludes. For more information about drugs UMP does not cover, see the \"Prescription drugs and products UMP does not cover\" section. If you have other prescription drug coverage If you have primary medical cov erage through another plan that covers prescription drugs, some of the limits and restrictions to prescription drug coverage listed on page 112 will apply when UMP pays secondary to another plan. See the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section for how to submit your prescription drug claim. Using network pharmacies when UMP is secondary If you have primary coverage through another plan that covers prescription drugs, show both plan cards to the pharmacy and make sure they know which plan is primary. It is important that the pharmacy bills the plans in the correct order, or claims may be denied or paid incorrectly. Using mail -order pharmacies when UMP is se condary If your primary plan uses Postal Prescription Services (PPS), UMP's network mail- order pharmacy, PPS may process payments for both plans and charge you only what is left. Make sure that PPS has your information for both plans and knows which plan i s primary. However, if your primary plan uses a different mail -order pharmacy, you will have to use your primary plan's mail -order pharmacy, then submit a paper claim for payment by UMP. See the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section for how t o do this. Where to buy your prescription drugs ALERT! If you use a non -network retail pharmacy, you will pay the entire cost of the prescription drug at the time of purchase and must submit a claim for reimbursement. However, only the allowed amount for c overed drugs will apply to your prescription drug out- of-pocket limit. Pharmacies are contracted through a different network than medical providers. See pages 82- 85 for how to confirm a pharmacy is in the plan's network. 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 83 Retail pharmacies You may use any retail pharmacy, but you will save money if you use a network pharmacy. WSRxS has a large national network of retail pharmacies, which includes many independent and regional pharmacies in Washington State, as well as national chains. Search for a network pharmacy on the UMP website at ump.regence.com/sebb/benefits/prescriptions or call WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361-1611 (TRS: 711). When you get your prescriptions at a network pharmacy, the pharmacy sends the claim to the plan for you, and you pay only your cost -share (coinsurance) as described in the table on page 78. Note: You will pay the entire cost for any prescription drug not covered by the plan, which does not apply to your prescription drug out -of-pocket limit. TIP: If you take a prescription drug regularly, you may be able to save money by filling up to a 90-day supply at a network retail pharmacy or through Postal Prescription Services (PPS), UMP's netwo rk mail -order pharmacy. Search for a network pharmacy and compare prices on the UMP website at ump.regence .com/sebb/benefits/prescriptions . Network vaccination pharmacies Many network retail pharmacies have vaccination pharmacists who may give covered preventive immunizations at no cost to you. Call a network pharmacy ahead of time to make sure the pharmacy has the vaccine you need. Present your UMP member ID card at the pharmacy counter bef ore receiving a vaccine. Mail-order pharmacy: Postal Prescription Services (PPS) ALERT! PPS cannot ship outside of the U.S. See \"Travel overrides for prescription drugs\" on page 92 if you will be traveling. PPS is the plan's only network mail -order pharmacy. Prescriptions purchased through other mail -order pharmacies are not covered if UMP is your primary plan. You may call PPS at 1 -800-552-6694 or WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361-1611 (TRS: 711) for more information about mail- order. To get started: Set up an account with PPS by going to the PPS website at ppsrx.com or calling PPS at the phone number listed above. Mail your prescription to PPS. Your provider may also electronically send or fax it to PPS at 1-800-723-9023. Prescriptions faxed to PPS must: Be faxed from the provider's office fax machine; Be on the provider's letterhead; and Include the member's name, address, phone number, member ID number, and date of birth. Note: Only a provider may fax in a prescription. You must follow these instructions to avoid a delay in filling your prescription. 84 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage ALERT! The plan does not cover other mail -order pharmacies outsid e of PPS if UMP is your primary insurance. If UMP is your secondary insurance, you may use another mail -order pharmacy (see page 83). Refills may be ordered through your online PPS account at ppsrx.com , or by calling PPS directly. Prescriptions are usually delivered within 7 to 10 days after the pharmacy receives your prescription. When using PPS, the same prescription drug coinsurance, preauthorization requirements, and limits on coverage apply as for prescription drugs purchased at retail network pharmacies. ALERT! If there is a short age of a specific prescription drug that PPS cannot control, and it does not have the quantity you ordered, PPS will contact you to discuss your options for obtaining your prescription(s). Because of increased volume at the end of the year, prescriptions s ubmitted to PPS in December may not be processed during the current benefit year. ALERT! Some Durable Medical Equipment (DME) items are not available through PPS. You will need to get them through a network retail pharmacy or network DME provider. How to get the plan discount You pay for prescription drugs based on the allowed amount (WSRxS' standard reimbursement). If you use a non -network pharmacy or do not show your UMP member ID card at a network pharmacy, and the amount charged is more than the UMP discounted allowed amount, you will pay the difference in addition to your coinsurance. If UMP is your primary insurance coverage, always show your UMP member ID card at the pharmacy to make sure you pay the right amount for your prescription. If UMP is your secondary insurance coverage, show both plan member ID cards at the pharmacy and make sure they know which plan pays first so the pharmacy may bill the plans in the correct order. Non-network pharmacies: Retail You will always save money when you buy your prescriptions at network retail pharmacies. You may buy your prescriptions (except specialty drugs) at a non -network retail pharmacy, but you will pay more if you do. If you get your prescriptions filled at a non -network retail pharmacy, the following app lies: You need to submit your claim to WSRxS for reimbursement (see the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section ). You do not get the plan discount. You will pay the difference between the allowed amount and what the pharmacy charges, and it wil l not apply to your prescription drug out -of-pocket limit. The plan pays the allowed amount for prescription drugs covered by the plan, whether from a network or non -network retail pharmacy, under the coinsurance percentages as shown in the table on page 78. The prescription cost -limit (see table on page 78) does not apply. 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 85 Non-network pharmacies will not know if a prescription drug must be preauthorized, has a quantity limit, or has other coverage limits. If you purchase a drug from a non -network pharmacy and limits apply, the plan may not cover or reimburse it. Specialty dru gs must be purchased from Ardon Health, unless you receive an authorization from WSRxS. Call WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361-1611 (TRS: 711). If Ardon Health gains access to the specialty drug, you will receive notification to transfer your prescriptio n to Ardon Health. TIP: To submit claims for prescriptions purchased from non -network pharmacies (U.S. retail or international retail pharmacies), see the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section. Prescription drugs purchased outside the U.S. If you purchase prescription drugs outside the U.S. for any reason, the following rules apply: If the prescription drug is available only by prescription in the U.S. but does not require one outside the U.S., the drug is covered only if prescribed by a provi der practicing within their scope of practice. If you get a prescription drug that is approved for use in another country but not in the U.S., the plan will not cover it. If you get a prescription drug that is available over -the-counter in the U.S., the plan will not cover the drug, even if you have a prescription from a provider prescribing within their scope of practice. The plan does not cover most over-the-counter drugs . If you get a prescription drug that is not covered by UMP, the plan will not pay any amount of the cost of the drug. You will be responsible for the full cost of the drug. To submit a claim for a prescription drug purchased at retail pharmacies outside the U.S., see the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section . All necessary information must be included on the prescription drug claim form with drugs and dosage documented. Guidelines for prescription drugs UMP covers The plan is a self -insured ACP. UMP is offered through the Washington State Health Care Authority's SEBB Program. UMP is administered by Regence BlueShield and WSRxS. All prescription drugs, services, or other benefit changes may require approval by the SEB Board at the time benefits are procured for the next calendar year. For example, prescription drugs newly approved by the FDA may require approval by the SEB Board before the plan will cover them. To be covered, a prescription drug must meet all of the following: Does not have a nonprescription alternative, including an over -the-counter alternative with similar safety, effectiveness, and ingredients. Has been dispensed from a licensed pharmacy employing licensed, registered pharmacists. Has been prescribed by a provider with prescribing authority within their scope of license. Has been reviewed by either th e Washington State P&T Committee or WSRxS (see page 77). Is approved by the FDA. Is medically necessary. Is not classified as a vitamin (except as listed below), min eral, dietary supplement, homeopathic drug, or medical food. 86 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Is not a noncovered prescription drug or product, unless an exception is granted. Is not an excluded prescription drug or product. May be legally obtained in the U.S. only with a written prescription. Meets plan coverage criteria. Note: The plan may require that you try standard treatment(s) before it will cover a prescription drug for off-label use (prescribed for a use other than its FDA -approved label). The plan will not cover any prescription drug when the FDA has determined its use to be unsafe. ALERT! The plan does not cover prescription drugs purchased through mail -order pharmacies located outside the U.S. Exceptions covered ALERT! The plan does not cover prescriptions that contain DHA (doc osahexaenoic acid). DHA is a dietary supplement, and dietary supplements are not covered by the plan. If you are prescribed a noncovered prescription drug not listed on the UMP Preferred Drug List, you may request an exception. For the exception process, refer to \"Requesting an exception for noncovered prescription drugs\" on page 81. Your prescription drug benefit also includes the following nonprescription drugs and supplies: Certain nicotine replacement therapy products (see page 72). Covered contraceptive devices and drugs (see page 54). FDA-approved over -the-counter contraceptives. For the plan to cover FDA -approved over -the-counter contraceptives, you must present your UMP member ID card and make your purchase at the pharmacy counter. When possible, get a prescription, as not all pharmacies have prescribing authority. If you go to a pharmacy without a prescription and the pharmacy does not have prescribing authority, you will need to submit a claim to WSRxS. Covered in sulin and diabetes care supplies, such as test strips, lancets, insulin syringes, and continuous glucose monitors used in the treatment of diabetes. See the \"Diabetes care supplies\" benefit for more information. Other over -the- counter products that are spe cifically noted in the UMP Preferred Drug List as covered by the plan. The plan covers FDA -approved prescription drugs for off- label use (prescribed for a use other than its FDA-approved label) only if it is not considered experimental or investigational by WSRxS and is recognized as effective for treatment: In a standard reference compendium and supported by peer -reviewed clinical evidence; or In most relevant peer -reviewed medical literature, if not recognized in a standard reference compendium; or By th e federal Secretary of Health and Human Services. 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 87 Products covered under the preventive care benefit ALERT! For products covered as preventive \u2014 even if normally available over -the-counter without a prescription \u2014 you must have a prescription and buy it at the pharmacy counter in a network pharmacy to receive 100 percent reimbursement. You may not receive full reimbursement for claims from non- pharmacy register receipts and non- network pharmacies. Some products are covered under the preventive care benefit if they: Are recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (see the \"Preventive care\" benefit ); and Conform to coverage guidelines (see page 77). The brands and types of products covered are limited. Call WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361-1611 (TRS: 711) for mor e information on which ones are covered. You pay $0 if your provider writes you a prescription and you purchase these products from the pharmacy counter at a network pharmacy. If you purchase over -the-counter and send in a paper claim, you may pay part of the cost. Contraceptive drugs and supplies are covered as preventive (see the \"Family planning services\" benefit for details). See the \"Tobacco cessation services\" benefit for products covered as preventive for tobacco cessation. Some injectable drugs are covered only under the prescription drug benefit Certain prescription drug categories are covered only under the prescription drug benefit and not the medical benefit. Your pharmacy may submit a claim for these prescription drug classes to WSRxS. A prescri ption drug may be approved for use for another condition but is still available only through the prescription drug benefit. Call WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361-1611 (TRS: 711) if you have questions. Compounded prescription drugs Compounded prescriptio n drugs are the result of combining, mixing, or altering ingredients by a pharmacist in response to a physician's prescription to create a new drug tailored to the specialized medical needs of an individual member. Traditional compounding typically occurs when an FDA -approved prescription drug is unavailable, or a licensed health care provider decides that an FDA -approved drug is not appropriate for a member's medical needs. Compounded prescription drugs are covered under Tier 2. Some c ompounded drugs requ ire preauthorization. Call WSRxS Customer Service to check if a compounded drug requires preauthorization. Claims for compounded drugs require additional information submitted on the claim form. This information is available from the compounding pharmacy. Limits on your prescription drug coverage WSRxS may exclude, not cover, discontinue, or limit coverage for any prescription drug or manufacturer's version of a drug \u2014 or shift a drug to a different tier, or to noncovered or excluded status \u2014 for any of the following reasons: A more cost -effective alternative is available to treat the same condition. A nonprescription alternative, including an over -the-counter alternative, becomes available. 88 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage A prescription drug receives FDA approval for a new use. Generic, b iosimilar, interchangeable biosimilar, or follow -on biologic prescription drugs become available. New prescription drugs are developed. The FDA denies, withdraws, or limits the approval of a prescription drug. The FDA's Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI) classifications finds a prescription drug to be less than effective. The Washington State P&T Committee or WSRxS recommends a change (see page 77). There is a sound medical reason. There is lack of scientific evidence that a prescription drug is as safe and effective as existing drugs used to treat the same or similar conditions. There is new scientific evidence demonstrating a prescription dru g has been found to be less safe or effective than existing drugs to treat the same or similar conditions. Using free prescription drug samples does not guarantee coverage or waive requirements for preauthorization, step therapy, quantity limits, day supply limits, or other limitations. Prescription drugs will only be covered if they are not excluded by the plan, are a covered prescription drug on the UMP Preferred Drug List, and are medically necessary for your health condition. Your provider may prescribe a prescription drug or drug dose that is not medically necessary. The plan excludes experimental or investigational prescription drugs. You may be liable for all charges if you receive prescription drugs or products that are determined to be experimental or investigational (see the \"What the plan does not cover\" section). If you disagree with the plan's determination, you have the right to an appeal (see the \"Complaint and appeal procedures\" section for that process). The limits and restrictions described in \"Limits on your prescription drug coverage\" on page 87 through \"Refill too soon\" on page 92 help WSRxS monitor drug usage, safety, and costs. These limits and restrictions may be added or removed from prescription drugs at any time. You may find out if your prescription drug falls under any of these limits and restrictio ns by checking the UMP Preferred Drug List on the UMP website at ump.regence.com/sebb/benefits/prescriptions or calling WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361-1611 (TRS: 711). Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) is a drug safety program that the FDA can require for certain prescription drugs with serious safety concerns to help make sure the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. REM S are designed to reinforce prescription drug use behaviors and actions that support the safe use of that drug. While all drugs have labeling that describe possible risks, only a few prescription drugs require a REMS. REMS are not designed to mitigate all the adverse events of a prescription drug. These are communicated to health care providers in the drug's prescribing information. Rather, REMS focuses on preventing, monitoring, and/or managing a specific serious risk by informing, educating, and/or reinforcing actions to reduce the frequency and/or severity of the event. If the REMS program is not followed, the plan may not cover the restricted drug. Preauthorizing prescription drugs Preauthorization is a process that helps make sure that prescription dr ug benefits are administered as designed and that plan members receive a drug therapy that is safe and effective for their conditions, and provides the greatest value. Some prescription drugs require preauthorization to determine whether they are medically necessary and meet all applicable coverage criteria, or the plan will not cover them. You may 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 89 find out if your prescription drug requires preauthorization by calling WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888- 361-1611 (TRS: 711) or checking the UMP Preferred Drug Li st on the UMP website at ump.regence.com/sebb/benefits/prescriptions. You and your prescribing provider may also find the coverage criteria for your prescription drug by referring to the Washington State Rx Services (Moda) preauthorization (UMP [ SEBB ] Plans) preauthorization requirements on forms and publications at hca.wa.gov/ump-forms- pubs. If your prescription drug requires preauthori zation, your pharmacist or prescribing provider may initiate a request through CoverMyMeds, a free online platform that accepts requests from electronic health records, or directly through the CoverMyMeds Portal. To get started, your pharmacist or prescribing provider can go to the CoverMyMeds website at covermymeds.com. They may also call WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361-1611 (TRS: 711) to request it. If you have an existing authorization from UMP for a brand -name drug, and a generic drug becomes available, you may need to renew your authorization to continue filling the brand -name drug. However, if you switch to the generic drug, a new preauthorization is not required until the existing authorization expires. Note: Prescription drugs covered under the medical benefit rather than the prescription drug benefit have different rules for preauthorization. Call UMP Customer Service at 1- 800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) for details. Emergency fill Emergency fill lets you get a limited quantity of certain prescription drugs while the plan processes your preauthorization request. This option is only available when a delay could result in emergency care, hospital admission, or a serious threat to your health or others in contact with you. Call WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361-1611 (TRS: 711) for questions about which prescriptions drugs may qualify for emergency fills. You must bring your prescription to a network pharmacy and state that you need an emergency fill while the pla n processes your preauthorization request. You pay your coinsurance under the prescription drug's tier. The plan will cover an emergency fill of up to a seven -day prescription drug supply. Preauthorization requests are usually determined within three to f ive business days. If your preauthorization request is denied, you will pay the full cost of the prescription drug for any quantity you receive after the emergency fill. Emergency fill limits The following limits still apply to emergency fill prescription drugs: Quantity limits: You cannot get more than the stated quantity limit under an emergency fill. If you have a current filled prescription for a prescription drug (or its therapeutic equivalent) and it was filled to the quantity limit, you cannot get an emergency fill until you have used 84 percent or more of the filled prescription. Refill too soon: If you have a filled prescription for a prescription drug (or its therapeutic equivalent), you cannot get an emergency fill until you have used 84 percent or more of the filled prescription. Quantity limits Certain prescription drugs have a per prescription limit on how much you get for each fill. If you need more than this limit allows, your pharmacist or prescribing provider may initiate a request through CoverMyMeds on the CoverMyMeds website at covermymeds.com or call WSRxS Customer Service at 1 - 888-361-1611 (TRS: 711). 90 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage If WSRxS denies your request or your provider or pharmacist does not get preauthorization, the plan will cover the prescription drug only up to the quantity limit amount. You will pay for any extra amount. Specialty drugs ALERT! Ardon Health, the plan's network specialty pharmacy, cannot ship outside the U.S. See \"Travel overrides for prescription drugs\" on page 92 if you will be traveling. Specialty drugs are high -cost injectable, infused, oral, or inhaled prescription drugs or products that require special handling and storage and are subject to additional r ules. You may find out if a drug is a specialty drug by checking the UMP Preferred Drug List on the UMP website at ump.regence.com/sebb/benefits/prescriptions, or by calling WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361- 1611 (TRS: 711). Specialty drugs are covered under the cost -share tier listed on the UMP Preferred Drug List. Specialty drugs are covered only when purchased through the plan's network specialty drug pharmacy, Ardon Health. If Ardon Health does not have access to a specialty drug, you will be notified to fill your prescription at another specialty pharmacy. If Ardon Health gains access to the specialty drug, you w ill receive notification to transfer your prescription to Ardon Health. You may receive up to a 30 -day supply for most specialty prescription drugs per prescription or refill. However, some may be limited to a 15 -day supply due to high discontinuation rate , short duration of use, or to make sure that the prescription drug is not causing harmful side effects. Specialty drugs require preauthorization. See \"Preauthorizing prescription drugs\" on page 88 for how to request preauthorization. A patient care coordinator will work with you to schedule a delivery time for the prescription drug. The specialty pharmacy will deliver your prescription drugs anywhere in the U.S. tha t you choose, such as to your workplace or to a neighbor if you cannot be home for the delivery. Specialty prescription drugs often require special handling and storage. The plan is not responsible for replacement of lost, stolen, expired, or damaged presc ription drugs or products (see page 104). If your provider will be administering the prescription drug, you may have it shipped to the provider's office. However, once the provider's office receives the prescription drug, the provider takes responsibility for it. Prescription cost -limit for specialty drugs ALERT! The prescription cost -limit is the most you will pay for an individual prescription. However, you may pay less based on normal coinsurance (see page 78). See the \"How the prescription drug cost-limit works\" section for details about the prescription cost- limit. This limit applies to individual prescriptions only. See the \"Your prescription drug out -of-pocket limit\" section for the annual limit to your prescription drug costs. Specialty drugs are usually limited to no more than a 30 -day supply. The prescription cost- limit for a 30-day (or under) supply corresponds to the \"You pay\" column in the table on page 79. However, some specialty prescript ion drugs are available only in packages with more than a 30 -day supply. In such cases, the prescription cost- limit shown in the table on page 79 is calculated by multiplying the standard 30 -day prescription cost- limit amount as follows: 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 91 A 31- to 60 -day supply, multiply the standard prescription cost- limit by two. A 61- day and greater s upply, multiply the standard prescription cost -limit by three. Example: If your specialty drug is Tier 2 and you receive a 45 -day supply, the most you will pay (prescription cost- limit) is $150 (standard 30 -day limit $75 x 2=$150). Step therapy ALERT! If a Step 2 or Step 3 drug is approved for coverage by WSRxS, you will pay the applicable cost -share of that prescription drug according to its tier in the UMP Preferred Drug List. When a prescription drug is part of the step therapy program, you have to try c ertain drugs (Step 1) before the plan will cover the prescribed ( Step 2 ) drug. When a prescription for a step therapy drug is submitted \"out of order,\" meaning you have not first tried the Step 1 drug before submitting a prescription for a Step 2 drug, the plan will not cover your prescription. When this happens, your provider will need to prescribe the Step 1 drug for you. If you or your provider feels that you need the Step 2 prescription filled as originally written without first trying the Step 1 drug, your pharmacist or prescribing provider may call WSRxS Customer Service at 1 - 888-361-1611 (TRS: 711) and request coverage. You will have to pay the entire cost of the prescription drug if you have not tried the Step 1 drug and coverage has not been authori zed before you get the Step 2 drug. To find out if step therapy applies to your drug, check the UMP Preferred Drug List on the UMP website at ump.regence.com/sebb/benefits/prescriptions, or call WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361-1611 (TRS: 711). Note: Only network pharmacies will check to see if step therapy applies to your prescription drug. If you get a step therapy drug at a non -network pharmacy, the plan may not cover the drug. Substi tution under Washington State law ALERT! New generic prescription drugs are released throughout the year. If you want to save money by using generics, ask your provider to allow substitution on your prescriptions, even if a generic drug is not available no w. That way, when one becomes available, the pharmacist may automatically refill with the generic. When a brand -name or biologic prescription drug has a generic equivalent or interchangeable biosimilar, pharmacists in Washington State must substitute the generic equivalent or interchangeable biosimilar drug for the brand -name or biologic prescription dr ug. Your provider may write the prescription \"dispense as written\" if they want you to get only the prescribed brand -name or biologic prescription drug. Or you may tell the pharmacist you want the brand -name or biologic drug. Regardless of whether you or your prescribing provider ask the pharmacist to \"dispense as written,\" if you get the noncovered prescription drug, the plan may not cover it. Final determination of medical necessity for FDA -approved contraceptives is determined by the attending prescribi ng provider. To request an exception for a noncovered drug, see page 81. 92 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Therapeutic Interchange Program The Washington State Therapeutic Interchange Program allows a pharmacist to substitute a \"therapeutic alternative\" drug for a noncovered drug in certain cases. Therapeutic alternatives are drugs that are chemically different from your prescribed drug but provide the same therapeutic benefit. You may find out if your prescription drug is affected by the Therapeutic Interchange Program by checking the UMP Preferred Drug List on the UMP website at ump.regence.com/sebb/benefits/prescriptions or by calli ng WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361- 1611 (TRS: 711). The Therapeutic Interchange program does not affect all noncovered prescription drugs. The pharmacist will substitute the preferred drug when your prescribing provider has \"endorsed\" the Washington Preferred Drug List, and: You are filling your prescription in Washington State or through PPS. Your prescribing provider allows substitution on your prescription. If you do not want your prescription drug to be changed, the plan may not cover your drug if y ou ask the pharmacist to fill the prescription as written. Regardless of whether you or your prescribing provider ask the pharmacist to \"dispense as written,\" if you get the noncovered prescription drug, the plan may not cover it. The pharmacy will contact your provider to request authorization for the substitution. If approved by the provider, you will receive the alternative preferred drug along with a letter of explanation. If the pharmacy cannot get an authorization from your provider within 48 hours, t he prescription will be filled as written, and you will be charged the full price of the drug. Travel overrides for prescription drugs You may request a travel override to get an extra supply of prescription drugs for extended travel. All of the condition s listed below apply. You may request a travel override up to two weeks before your departure. You may request no more than two travel overrides per calendar year, including all travel within or outside the U.S. Within the U.S., you may request up to a 90 -day supply per prescription, or as allowed under that prescription. Outside the U.S., you may request up to a six- month supply per prescription, or as allowed under that prescription. Travel overrides will be granted only while you are covered by the plan.

To request a travel override, call WSRxS Customer Servi ce at 1 -888-361-1611 (TRS: 711). Refill too soon The plan will not cover a refill until 84 percent of the last prescription should be used up. Claims for therapeutic equivalents of the previously prescribed drug will also be denied. This also applies if yo ur prescription is damaged, destroyed, lost, or stolen. For example, if you get a 90 -day supply and you try to refill this prescription before 76 days have passed, coverage will be denied. However, in the event of an emergency or other urgent circumstance, you may request an exception to override the refill too soon policy. The plan may require documentation to support your request. Approval of your request is at the sole discretion of the plan. 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 93 Early refill for a natural disaster You may request an early refill for your prescription when you need to evacuate for a natural disaster. To request an early refill or to locate pharmacies that remain open near you, call WSRxS Customer Service at 1-888-361-1611 (TRS: 711). What to do if the plan denies coverage TIP: If your prescription claims are denied by the pharmacy due to plan eligibility issues or termination of coverage, contact: Employees: Your employer's payroll or benefits office. SEBB Continuation Coverage: SEBB Program at 1 -800-200-1004 (TRS: 711). If a network pharmacy (including the mail- order or specialty pharmacy) tells you that preauthorization is required, coverage is denied, or quantities are limited, you, your pharmacist, or your prescribing provider may call WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361-1611 (TRS: 711) to request a coverage review or preauthorization. If WSRxS denies the coverage request, you have the right to submit an appeal (see the \"Complaint and appeal procedures\" section ). If your provider thinks you need the prescription drug i mmediately, they may request an expedited review by submitting all clinically relevant information to the plan by phone or fax. An expedited appeal replaces the first and second level appeals. WSRxS will decide on coverage of the prescription drug within 7 2 hours of the request. In this case, you may choose to purchase a three -day supply at your own expense. Prescription drugs and products UMP does not cover Prescription drugs and products not covered under the prescription drug benefit include, but are no t limited to, noncovered prescription drugs and excluded drugs and products. Noncovered prescription drugs Noncovered prescription drugs without a UMP Preferred Drug List exception authorization For more information see the \"Noncovered prescription drugs \" section on page 76 . Excluded drugs and products Dental preparations, such as rinses and pastes Dietary/food supplements, vitamins, minerals, herbal supplements, and medical foods Experimental or investigational prescription drugs Homeopathic drugs, including FDA -approved prescription products Over -the-counter drugs, products containing an over -the- counter drug, or prescription drugs that have a nonprescription alter native, except for the drugs specified under \"Exceptions covered\" on page 86, or otherwise listed on the UMP Preferred Drug List . Note: Prescription drugs with a no nprescription alternative \u2014 including an over -the-counter alternative having similar safety, efficacy, and ingredients \u2014 are excluded. Over -the-counter products not approved by and registered with the FDA Prescription drug costs covered by other insurance (s ee page 112 for coordination with other plans ) 94 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Prescription drugs not approved by the FDA Prescription drugs provided to a member, in whole or in part, while the member is a patient in a mental health, substance use disorder, residential treatment or skilled nursing facility, hospital (emergency room or inpatient), or any other inpatient facility. Drugs provided in an inpatient setting are processed through the med ical benefit. Prescription drugs that are not medically necessary Prescription drugs that are repackaged Prescription drugs that the FDA's DESI classifications have found to be less than effective Prescription drugs under a REMS program required by the FDA when prescribed outside REMS guidelines (see page 88 for details) Products considered as a medical device by the FDA. Medical devices may be covered under your medical benefit The plan also excludes prescription drugs to treat conditions that are not covered under the medical benefit. These include, but are not limited to, prescription drugs for: Cosmetic purposes. Fertility or infertility. Obesity ( or weight loss). Promoting hair growth. Sexual dysfunction. ALERT! Prescription drugs classified as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have over -the-counter alternatives and are not covered for persons ages 18 and over. The plan does cover PPIs for persons under age 18 when prescribed, because the available over -the-counter alternatives are not approved for persons under age 18. Limits on plan coverage If you receive a service that is not medically necessary, is experimental or investigational, is listed as an exclusion in the \"What the plan does not cover\" section, or is listed as a noncovered or excluded prescription drug, you are responsible for paying all associated charges. Preauthorizing medical services ALERT! This section does not apply to prescription drugs. See page 88 for how to request preauthorization of drugs covered under the prescription drug benefit. The plan m ust preauthorize some medical services and supplies to determine whether the service or supply meets the plan's medical necessity criteria to be covered. The fact that a service or supply is prescribed or furnished by a provider does not, by itself, make i t a medically necessary covered service . Preauthorization is not a guarantee of coverage. A change after the plan has approved a preauthorization request \u2014 including, but not limited to, a change of provider or different/additional services \u2014 requires yo u to submit a new preauthorization request and for the plan to approve it. 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 95 Your preauthorization role ALERT! Excluded, experimental, and investigational services do not require a preauthorization because they are not covered by the plan. To confirm whether a service is covered, call UMP Customer Service at 1- 800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) . To be covered, some services, including, but not limited to, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) Therapy for members ages 18 and older (see page 42) and bariatric surgery (see page 43), must be preauthorized before services are received. A network provider may be required to request preauthorization before providing services. An out -of-network provider is not obligated to obtain prior authorization for services that require a preauthorization because they do not have a contract with Regence. If an out -of-network provider does not obtain a required preauthorization in advance of the service, you will be responsible for all charges billed to you. You are encouraged to request that an out -of-network provider preauthorize certain services on your behalf to de termine medical necessity before the services are provided. They have the clinical details and technical billing information needed to submit a request. Call UMP Customer Service at 1- 800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) to ask if a service requires preauthorization an d how to submit a request. You may be liable for all charges if you receive services that are determined to be not medically necessary, experimental or investigational, or not covered under this plan (see the \"What the plan does not cover\" section). ALERT! See the \"Complaint and appeal procedures\" section for how to appeal denial of a preauthorization request before receiving services. List of services and supplies requiring preauthorization or notice For a list of services and supplies requiring preauthori zation or notice: Visit the UMP website at ump.regence.com/sebb/benefits/policies. Call UMP Customer Service at 1- 800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) to request a printed list or ask questions. ALERT! The UMP preauthorization list is updated throughout the year. You may find a link to the current list of services that require preauthorization at the UMP website at ump.regence.com/sebb/benefits/policies or call UMP Customer Service at 1- 800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) to determine if services require preauthorization or notice. The fact that a service does not require preauthorization or notice does not guarantee coverage. Notice for facility admissions Your provider must notify the plan upon your admission to a facility for services requiring plan notice. You may find a list of services requiring plan notice by visiting the UMP website at 96 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage ump.regence.com/sebb/benefits/policies or calling UMP Customer Service at 1-800-628-3481 (TRS: 711). Facility admissions for which the plan is not notified may not be covered. Notice is usually done by the facility at the time you are admitted. Notice is not the same as preauthorization and many services require both. What i s the difference between preauthorization and notice? ALERT! Many services, including, but not limited to, inpatient services, require both preauthorization and notice. Call UMP Customer Service at 1- 800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) or talk to your provider if you have questions about services needing preauthorization or notice. \"Preauthorization\" is when your provider sends a request for coverage of a service on the UMP preauthorization list on the UMP w ebsite at ump.regence.com/sebb/benefits/policies. Preauthorization is usually requested by the provider performing the services. The plan sends either an approval or denial of coverage. If the plan does not approve services that require preauthorization b efore services are received, the plan may deny coverage. The plan does not approve or deny preauthorization for services that are not on the UMP preauthorization list. \"Notice\" means that your provider must contact the plan to let us know when you receive services. Notice is usually done by the facility when you are admitted. ALERT! If the plan denies preauthorization and you receive those services anyway, you are responsible for the provider's entire billed charge . How long the plan has to make a decision You will be notified in writing within 15 calendar days of the plan receiving the preauthorization request whether the request has been approved, denied, or if more information is needed to make a decision. If additional information is requested: You are allowed up to 45 calendar days from the date on the letter to submit the information requested. You will be notified in writing of the decision within 15 calendar days from either the plan receiving the additional requested information or the end of the 45 -day period if no additional information is received. If you or your provider believes that waiting for a decision under the standard time frame could place your life, health, or ability to regain maximum function in serious danger, your provider should no tify the plan by phone or fax as a shorter time limit may apply. This is also known as an expedited preauthorization request. Regence BlueShield will decide on your expedited preauthorization request within 72 hours of receipt. General information from UMP Customer Service For services not requiring preauthorization, you may call UMP Customer Service 1-800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) to ask if a particular service is generally covered by the plan, and for an estimate of how much you 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 97 will pay. The plan does not appr ove or deny preauthorization for services that are not on the UMP preauthorization list. Until a claim is submitted and reviewed, the plan cannot guarantee that your service will be covered or give you an exact amount you will pay out of pocket. This is be cause when a provider bills for a service, the plan pays for it based on procedure codes. Each code describes a service in some detail, and there are many codes for similar -sounding services. Your provider, not the plan, determines which of these codes is used on the submitted claim. Case management The plan offers case management to help members with serious or complex health care needs coordinate their care. Case management services are provided at no additional cost to the member. A case manager helps yo u find health care providers and services appropriate for your treatment. When preauthorization is requested for a condition that may benefit from case management services, or when the plan receives a claim for services indicating complex health needs, you will be contacted by case management staff. Case management services help you: Make sure you get the most out of your UMP plan benefits. Find network providers, facilities, and other resources to assist in the coordination of your medical care. Keep your health care costs down (e.g., negotiating rates when no network providers are available). You, your family, an authorized representative, or any provider or facility (such as a hospital) involved in your treatment may call Regence at 1- 866-543-5765 to request evaluation and consideration of case management services. Case management as a condition of coverage An HCA or plan medical director may review medical records and determine that your use of certain services is potentially harmful , excessive, or medically inappropriate. Based on this determination, the plan may require you to participate in and comply with a case management plan as a condition of continued benefit payment. Alternative benefits Alternative benefits mean benefits for services or supplies that are not otherwise covered as specified in this COC, but for which the plan may approve coverage after case management evaluation. The plan may cover alternative benefits through case management (see above) if the plan determines that alternative benefits are medically necessary and will result in overall reduced covered costs and improved quality of care. Before alternative benefits will be covered, the plan, you (or your legal representative), and, if required by the plan, your physician or other provider, must enter into a written agreement of the terms and conditions for payment. Alternative benefits are approved on a case -specific basis only. Approval of an alternative benefit applies to only the services and member listed in the written agreement. The rest of this COC remains in effect. 98 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage What the plan does not cover TIP: If you have any questions about services the plan does not cover, call UMP Customer Service at 1- 800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) or WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361-1611 (TRS: 711).

See page 110 for a description of how the plan coordinates benefits when it pays second. The plan processes claims differently depending on if it is the primary payer or the secondary payer. The differences are described in the next several pages. TIP: If you have other health coverage, it is important that you let your providers know, including the pharmacies where you get your prescription drugs. Contact UMP and WSRxS If you or your dependents have other insurance, you must let UMP and WSRxS know so claims are processed correctly. To do this, you must complete and submit a separate form for medical services and prescription drugs. See the table below for how to find the forms. Each person claiming payment for benefits under the plan is required to give Regence and WSRxS any facts needed to apply these COB rules. If your coverage under other plans changes, call the customer service phone numbers listed in the table. 108 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage method Medical services: UMP Prescr iption drug services: WSRxS Phone Call UMP Customer Service at 1-800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) to request a form.

Alert: Medicare will be the primary payer for covered benefits provided to Medicare-eligible members who are enrolled in UMP as a dependent of a currently employed state- registered domestic partner. Medicare will remain the secondary payer for benefits payable under UMP for (1) individuals age 65 or over who have UMP as a result of their own current employee status, or (2) individuals age 65 or over who have UMP as a result of the current employment status of a spouse of any age. When UMP coordinates benefits with other plans, the following rules determine which plan pays first. These rules apply in order, so the first rule below that applies to your situation will determine which plan is your primary coverage, and subsequent rules will not apply. The following plan pays first: Any group plan that does not coordinate benefits. The plan that covers the member as a subscriber, not a dependen t. Exception: When the subscriber is a Medicare beneficiary, the plan covering the person as the retiree is secondary to the plan covering the person as a dependent. 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 109 The plan that covers the member (or their spouse or state -registered domestic partner) as an active employee pays before a plan that covers the member as a retired employee. A plan covering the member as an employee, subscriber, retiree, or the dependent of such an employee, subscriber, or retiree will pay before a COBRA or a state right of continuation plan. If the other plan is Medicare, UMP pays first if the member is age 65 or over who have UMP as a result of their own active employee status or the ac tive employee status of a spouse of any age. Note: Medicare benefits are primary to UMP for members who are enrolled in UMP as a dependent of a currently employed state -registered domestic partner. The plan that has covered the member (or their spouse or state -registered domestic partner) as a subscriber the longest, if there are two plans and the first five bullets do not determine which plan pays first. If none of the preceding rules determines the order of benefits, the allowable expenses must be shared equally between the plans. For dependent children A group plan is usually primary over Medicaid programs that cover children. If a dependent child has group coverage through their employer, the ch ild's coverage pays first. Dependent children of married parents The group plan of the parent whose birthday is earlier in the year pays first. For example, the plan of a parent born April 14 is primary over the plan of a parent born August 21. This is cal led the \"birthday rule.\" This rule looks only at the month and day, not the year. If both parents have the same birthday, the plan that has covered either parent the longest is primary. Exception for newborn children: Under Washington State law, the plan must cover newborns under the mother's coverage for the first 21 days of life. Therefore, the mother's plan pays first for covered charges during the first 21 days of a newborn's life. Dependent children of legally separated or divorced parents When no cour t order specifies which parent is responsible for providing health insurance coverage, the following standard COB rules determine which plan pays first: 1. The plan of the custodial parent. 2. The plan of the custodial parent's spouse, if the custodial parent ha s remarried. 3. The plan of the non- custodial parent. 4. The plan of the non- custodial parent's spouse, if the non- custodial parent has remarried. The custodial parent is the parent awarded custody by a court decree or, in the absence of a court decree, is the p arent with whom the child resides more than one half of the calendar year, excluding any temporary visitation. The birthday rule is used to determine which parent's plan pays first if: The court order states that both parents are responsible for the child' s/children's health coverage and expenses. The court order awards joint custody without specifying that one parent is responsible for the child's/children's health coverage and expenses. If the court order states one parent is to assume primary financial responsibility for the child but does not specify that one parent is responsible for health coverage and health care expenses, the plan of the parent assuming financial responsibility is the primary payer. 110 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage In some cases, a court order determines payment for health care expenses. In those cases, standard COB rules may not apply. You must promptly provide the plan with copies of the court order for the plan to determine which plan pays first. If a dependent child is covered under more than one plan through persons who are not the child's parent or stepparent (e.g., a grandparent or other guardian), the plan will use the birthday rule to determine which plan pays first. If none of the preceding rules determine who pays first, then each plan covers half of the al lowed expenses. Federal and military plans UMP usually pays first over certain federal or military programs for veterans (retired military members). When UMP pays first When the plan is the primary payer (pays first), UMP pays its normal benefit as described in this COC. You may need to send UMP's Explanation of Benefits and a copy of your provider's bill to your secondary payer to receive payment. Check with that plan for more information. When UMP is supposed to pay first, but another plan did inst ead If another plan pays first on claims where UMP should have paid first: UMP may pay the other plan the amount UMP should have paid. Amounts UMP pays to the other plan are considered benefits paid by UMP. How UMP coordinates benefits when it pays second UMP uses a type of COB called nonduplication of benefits (see examples on page 155). When UMP pays second to another plan that covers the member, UMP will pay only an amount needed to bring the total benefit up to the amount UMP would have paid if the member did not have another plan. The intent of this type of COB is to maintain the level of benefits available through UMP. The nonduplication of benefits type of coor dination is not designed to pay your covered expenses in full. When UMP pays second, it coordinates with these types of plans: Governmental programs including, but not limited to, Medicare and Medicaid. Group, blanket, or franchise health or disability insurance policies; health care service contractor and health maintenance organization group agreements issued by insurers; health care service contractors; and health maintenance organizations. Labor management trusteed plans, labor organization plans, emplo yer plans, or employee benefit organization plans. ALERT! If you have other primary coverage that pays for services, those services will apply to the UMP benefit limit. How much you may pay when UMP pays second When you see network providers under UMP, you will owe only the balance of the UMP allowed amount after your primary plan and UMP pay benefits for covered services. Your cost will usually be higher if you see out -of-network providers. See the \"Sample payments to different provider types\" section for examples. 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 111 The examples in the table below assume that you have met your medical deductible. Situation Example Network provider charge UMP allowed amount UMP normal benefit Other plan pays UMP pays You pay your provider UMP is primary, other plan is secondary EXAMPLE 1: When UMP pays first (or is the only plan) $200 $100 $85 (85% of $100) N/A $85 $15 UMP is secondary, other plan is primary EXAMPLE 2: The other plan pays less than the normal UMP benefit $200 $100 $85 $80 $5 $15 UMP is secondary, other plan is primary EXAMPLE 3: The other plan pays as much as (or more than) the normal UMP benefit $200 $100 $85 $85 $0 $15 Contact UMP Customer Service at 1- 800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) for help with any questions if you are covered by more than one plan. Submit secondary claims promptly All health plans have a \"timely filing\" deadline. The timely filing deadline for UMP is 12 months from the date of service. If a claim is not submitted within the plan's timely filing deadline, UMP will deny it. If your primary plan delays payment on a claim, you must still submit to UMP within the filing deadline to prevent denial of the claim. UMP may try to contact your primary plan for their benefit payment information or may estimate it to provide timely processing of your secondary benefit. Adjustments may be made when the primary plan pays their portion of your claim. Notifying your providers of any change to your coverage will help avoid errors and delays in processing of claims (see pages 112- 116). How diabetes care su pplies are covered when UMP pays second UMP covers diabetes care supplies under the prescription drug benefit. If you get your supplies from a pharmacy, ask if the pharmacy can bill both your primary plan and UMP. If your pharmacy does, you do not need to do anything further. If not, you will need to send a claim to WSRxS for secondary payment (see page 114 for instructions). If you get your supplies from a diabetes care supplier, the primary plan may process the claim as medical. In this case, you need to send your Explanation of Benefits and a claim form to WSRxS for secondary payment (see pages 114- 115 for instructions). Note: Nonduplication of benefits applies to these claims, which means that UMP may pay nothing after your primary plan pays. See the \"Diabetes care supplies\" benefit for mor e information . 112 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage ALERT! You must submit secondary claims for diabetes care supplies to WSRxS. Regence BlueShield will deny these claims. How COB works with prescription drugs Some of the limits and restrictions to prescription drug coverage listed on pages 87 -93 will apply when UMP pays second to another plan. See the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section for how to submit your prescription drug claim. Nonduplication of benefits applies when UMP pays second to another plan. This means that UMP may pay nothing after your primary plan pays. Using network pharmacies whe n UMP is secondary If you have primary coverage through another plan that covers prescription drugs, show both plan member ID cards to the pharmacy and make sure they know which plan pays first and which plan pays second. It is important that the pharmacy bills the plans in the correct order, or claims may be denied or paid incorrectly. Using mail -order pharmacies when UMP is secondary If your primary plan also uses PPS as the plan's network mail -order pharmacy, PPS may process payments for both plans and charge you only the remainder. Make sure that PPS has the information for both plans and knows which plan is primary. However, if your primary plan uses a different mail -order pharmacy, you will have to use your primary plan's mail -order pharmacy, then submit a paper claim to UMP. See the \"Submitting a claim for prescription drugs\" section for how to do this. Billing and payment: filing a claim Submitting a claim for medical services When UMP is your primary insurance and your provider is a network provider, you do not need to submit claims. The provider will do it for you. If you have a question about whether your provider's office has submitted a claim, sign in to your Regence account at ump.regence.com/ump/signin or call UMP Customer Service at 1- 800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) . See the \"Submitting a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global\u00aeCore claim\" section on page 26 for instructions on submitting a claim for services received outside of the United States. TIP: In the following section, Uniform Medical Plan (UMP) refers to the administrative functions for submitting claims to UMP. Regence BlueShield handles medical claims, and WSRxS handles prescription drugs claims. When you need to submit a claim You may need to submit a claim to UMP for payment if: You receive services from an out -of-network provider. You have other insurance that pays first and UMP is secondary. 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 113 Out- of-network providers may submit a claim on your behalf. Ask your provider. How to submit a claim To submit a claim yourself, you may sign in to your Regence account at ump.regence.com/ump/signin and go to the Submit claim webpage at regence.com/member/submit- claim/ or you may complete a medical claim form and mail the following docume nts: UMP (Regence) Medical Claim Form \u2014 You may find the form online by visiting forms and publications at hca.wa.gov/ump-forms- pubs or you may request a form by calling UMP Customer Service at 1-800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) . An itemized bill from your provider that describes the services you received and the charges. The following information must appear on the provider's itemized bill for the plan to consider the claim for payment: Member's name and member ID number, including the alpha prefix (three letters and the 'W' before member ID number) Procedure and diagnosis code(s) or description of the injury or illness Date and type of service Provider's name, address, phone number , and National Provider Identifier (NPI) or Tax ID number For ambulance claims, also include the ZIP code of where the member was picked up and where they were taken If UMP is secondary, you must include a copy of your primary plan's Explanation of Benefits, which lists the services cov ered and how much the other plan paid. You should wait until the primary plan has paid to submit a secondary claim to UMP, unless the primary plan's processing of the claim is delayed. Claims not submitted to UMP within 12 months of the date of service wil l not be paid. If we must request additional information, the processing of your claim may be delayed. Note: Be sure to make copies of your documents for your records. Mail both the claim form and the provider's claim document (or bill) to: Regence BlueShield PO Box 1106 Lewiston, 83501- 1106 Or you can fax documents to Regence at 1 -877-357-3418. The plan may send reimbursement for services received from an out -of-network provider to the provider or to you in the form of a check li sting both you and the provider as payees. If you paid up front for services, proof of payment may be required. Call UMP Customer Service at 1- 800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) if you have a question about the processing of your claim or for information on what is a cceptable as proof of payment. 114 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Important information about submitting claims ALERT! You or your provider must submit claims within 12 months of the date you received health care services. This is called the \"timely filing\" deadline. The plan will not pay c laims submitted more than 12 months after the date of service. See \"Submit secondary claims promptly\" on page 111 for how this works when you have other coverage th at pays f irst. For information about submitting claims for services outside of the U.S., call UMP Customer Service at 1-800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) . You may have to pay services upfront and submit a claim for reimbursement. If you have other health care cover age, see the \"If you have other medical coverage\" section for information on how the plan coordinates benefits with other plans. Services apply to the UMP medical deductible in the order claims are received, not necessarily in the order the member receives services. Claims reimbursement Most of the time, the plan will pay network providers directly. For claims submitted by you or an out -of- network provider, the plan will determine whether to pay you, the provider, or both. For a child covered by a legal qualified medical child support order (see page 109) the plan may pay the child's custodial parent or legal guardian. Claims determinations The plan will notify you of action taken on a claim within 30 days of the plan receiving it. This 30 -day period may be extended by 15 days when action cannot be taken on the claim due to: Circumstances beyond the plan's control. Notice will include an explanation why an extension is needed and when the plan expects to act on the claim. Lack of information. The plan will notify you within the 30 -day period that an extension is necessary, with a description of the information needed and why it is needed. Submitting a claim for prescription drugs You may need to submit your own prescription drug claim to WSRxS for reimbursement if you: Buy prescription drugs at a non -network retail pharmacy. Fail to show your UMP member ID card at a network pharmacy. Have other prescription coverage that pays first, and UMP is secondary. TIP: If you get a vaccine from an out- of-network provider, make sure that you submit your claim to Regence BlueShield as a medical claim (see page 112). Prescription drug claim forms are available by visiting forms and publications at hca.wa.gov/ump-forms- pubs or by calling WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361-1611 (TRS: 711). Send t he completed claim form, along with your pharmacy receipt(s), to: 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 115 Pharmacy Manual Claims PO Box 999 Appleton, WI 54912- 0999 It is a good idea to keep copies of all your paperwork for your records. When you submit a prescription drug claim to WSRxS, the plan pays the claim based on the following rules, no matter where you purchased the drug: The plan pays based on the allowed amount. If the pharmacy charges you more than the allowed amount, you will pay your usual coinsurance, plus the difference between what the plan paid and the pharmacy's charge. The plan pays all prescription drug claims, including non -network retail pharmacies, based on the drug's tier coinsurance (see the table on page 78). If your claim exceeds the quantity limit or the maximum days' supply allowed by the plan, the plan will pay only for the amount of the prescription drug up to the quantity limit or maximum days' supply. If you receive a refill before 84 percent of the last supply you received should have been taken, the plan will not pay for it. This is called a \"refill too soon\" (see page 92). You must submit prescription drug claims within 12 months of purchase. The plan will not pay claims for prescription drugs submitted more than 12 months after purchase. ALERT! If you do not show your UMP member ID card when purchasing a prescription at a WSRxS' network pharmacy, you will have to pay the full cash price and submit a Prescription Drug Claim Form. You will not receive the plan discount. False claims or statements Neither you nor your provider (or any person acting for you or your provider) may submit a claim for services or supplies that were not received, were resold to another party, or for which you are not expected to pay. In addition, neither you nor any person acting for you may make any false or incomplete statements or any false claims on any document for your plan coverage. The plan may recover any payments or overpayments made because of a false claim or false statement by withholding future claim payments, by suing you, or by other means. False claims may also be crimes. If you represent yourself as being enrolled in this plan when you are not, the plan will deny all claims. If the plan asks you for more information, you will be allowed at least 45 days to provide it. If the plan does not receive the information requested within the time allowed, the plan will deny the claim. 116 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Complaint and appeal procedures ALERT! In the following section, UMP refers to the administrative functions for appeals for UMP Plus. Regence BlueShield handles medical appeals and WSRxS handles appeals involving prescription drugs .

Claims payment, processing, or reimbursement for health care services or supplies. 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 117 The appeals process ALERT! If your appeal is for an urgent or life -threatening condition, see the \"Expedited appeals process \" section below. You or someone you authorize to represent you (see \"How to designate an authorized representative\" on page 141) may submit an appeal. The re are three levels to the appeals process: 1. First-level appeal 2. Second -level appeal 3. External review (independent review) Each of those parts are described in further detail below. Coverage during each review If your request involves a decision to change, r educe, or terminate coverage for services, supplies, or prescription drugs already being covered, the plan must continue to cover the disputed service until the outcome of the review. If the plan upholds the decision to change, reduce, or terminate coverag e, you will be responsible for the cost of the services received during the review period. If you request payment for denied claims or approval of services, supplies, or prescription drugs not yet covered by the plan, the plan will not cover the services, supplies, or prescription drugs while the appeal is under consideration. First-level and second -level appeal reviewers Claim processing disputes will be reviewed by administrative staff. The plan will consult with a health care professional employed by R egence BlueShield on medical appeals, or with a health care professional employed by Washington State Rx Services on prescription drug appeals, when appeals involve issues requiring medical judgment about covering, authorizing, or providing health care. That includes decisions based on determinations that a treatment, prescription drug, or other item is experimental, investigational, or not medically necessary. Your appeal will be reviewed by Regence BlueShield or Washington State Rx Services employees who have not been involved in, or subordinate to anyone involved in, reviewing the previous decisions. How to submit an appeal You or your authorized representative (including a relative, friend, advocate, attorney, or provider) may submit an appeal by using the methods described below in the \"Where to send complaints or appeals\" section.

The plan's rights apply without regard to the source of payment for medical expenses, whether from the proceeds of any settlement, arbitration award, or judgment, or other characterization of the recovery by you or any third party or the recovery source. The plan is entitled to reimbursement from the first dollar received from any recovery to the extent that the settlement or recovery exceeds full compensation to you for the injury or illness that you sustained. This applies regardless of whether: The third party or third party's insurer admits liability; The health ca re expenses are itemized or expressly excluded in the recovery; or The recovery includes any amount (in whole or in part) for services, supplies, or accommodations covered under the plan. You may be required to sign and deliver all legal papers and take an y other actions requested to secure the plan's rights (including an assignment of rights to pursue your claim if you fail to pursue your claim of recovery from the third party or other source). If you are asked to sign a trust/reimbursement agreement or ot her document to reimburse the plan from the proceeds of any recovery, you will be required to do so as a condition to advancement of any benefits. If you or your agent or attorney fail to comply during the course of the case, we may request refunds from the providers or offset future benefits. You will not do anything to prejudice the plan's rights and that you will cooperate fully with the plan, including signing any documents within the required time and providing prompt notice of any settlement or other recovery. You must notify the plan of any facts that may impact the right to reimbursement or subrogation, including, but not necessarily limited to, the following: The filing of a lawsuit; The making of a claim against any third party; Scheduling of settlement negotiations with a minimum of 21 days advance notice of the date, time, location and participants to be involved in any settlement conferences or mediations); or Intent of a third party to make payment of any kind to your benefit or on your behalf and that in any manner relates to the injury or illness that gives rise to the plan's right of reimbursement or subrogation (notice is required a minimum of five business days before the settlement).

By paying such benefits, the plan is not waiving any right to reimbursement or subrogation. Fees and expenses You may incur attorney's fees and costs in connection with obtaining a recovery.

Motor vehicle coverage If you are involved in a motor vehicle accident, whether as a driver, passenger, pedestrian, or other capacity, you may have rights under multiple motor vehicle insurance no fault coverages and also a gainst a third party who may be responsible for the accident.

Future medical expenses Benefits for otherwise covered services may be excluded as follows: When you have received a recovery from another source relating to an illness or injury for services for which we normally would provide benefits. The amount of any exclusions under this provision, however, will not exceed the amount of your recovery.

A school employee makes the change online in SEBB My Account or submits the required forms to their SEBB organization. All other subscribers submit the required forms to the SEBB Program. 2. If the subscriber fails to request enrollment or health plan coverage changes as directed by the NMSN, the SEBB organization or the SEBB Program may make enrollment or health plan coverage changes according to subsection (3) of this section upon request of: a. The child's other parent; or b. Child support enforcement program. 3. Changes to health plan coverage or enrollment are allowed as directed by the NMSN: a.

Changes to health plan coverage or enrollment as described in subsection (3)(a) through (c) of this section will begin the first day of the month following receipt of the NMSN. If the NMSN is received on the first day of the month, the change to health plan coverage or enrollment begins on that day. A dependent will be removed from the subscriber's health plan coverage as described in subsection (3)(d) of this section the last day of the month the NMSN is received. If that day is the first of the month, the change in enrollment will be made the last day of the previous month. 5. When a NMSN requires a spouse, former spouse, or other individual to provide health plan coverage for a dependent who is already enrolled in SEBB coverage, and that health plan coverage is in fact provided, the dependent may be removed from the subscriber's SEBB health plan coverage prospectively. When Medical Coverage Ends Medical coverage ends on the following dates : 1. On the last day of the month any enrollee ceases to be eligible; 2. On the date a medical plan terminates. If that should occur, the subscriber will have the opportunity to enroll in another SEBB medical plan; 3. For a school employee and their dependents when the employment relationship is terminated, medical coverage ends when: The school employee resigns. If this is the case, medical coverage ends on the last day of the month in which a school employee's resignation is effective; or The SEBB o rganization terminates the employment relationship.

For a continuation coverage subscriber who submits a written request to te rminate medical coverage, enrollment in medical coverage will be terminated the last day of the month in which the SEBB Program receives the request or on the last day of the month specified in the termination request, whichever is later. If the request is received on the first day of the month, medical coverage will be terminated on the last day of the previous month. Premium payments and applicable premium surcharges become due the first of the month in which medical coverage is effective. Premium payment s and applicable premium surcharges are not prorated during any month, even if an enrollee dies or asks to terminate their medical plan before the end of the month. An enrollee who is receiving covered services in a hospital on the date medical coverage en ds will continue to be eligible for covered services while an inpatient for the condition which the enrollee was hospitalized, until one of the following events occur: According to this plan's clinical criteria, it is no longer medically necessary for the enrollee to be an inpatient at the facility; 134 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage The remaining benefits available for the hospitalization are exhausted, regardless of whether a new calendar year begins; The enrollee becomes covered under another agreement with a group health plan that prov ides benefits for the hospitalization; or The enrollee becomes enrolled under an agreement with another carrier that provides benefits for the hospitalization. This provision will not apply if the enrollee is covered under another agreement that provides b enefits for the hospitalization at the time medical coverage ends, except as set forth in this section, or if the enrollee is eligible for SEBB Continuation Coverage as described in the section titled \"Options For Continuing SEBB Medical Coverage.\" A subsc riber will be responsible for payment of any services received after the date medical coverage ends as described in this subsection. When medical coverage ends, the enrollee may be eligible for continuation coverage or conversion to other health plan cove rage described in the section titled \"Options For Continuing SEBB Medical Coverage\" or the section titled \"Conversion Of Coverage.\" If a subscriber enrolls in continuation coverage, the subscriber is responsible for timely payment of premiums and applicabl e premium surcharges. If the monthly premium or applicable premium surcharges remain unpaid for 30 days, it will be considered delinquent. A subscriber is allowed a grace period of 30 days from the date the monthly premiums or applicable premium surcharges become delinquent to pay the unpaid premium balance or applicable premium surcharges. If the subscriber's premium balance or applicable premium surcharges remain unpaid for 60 days from the original due date, the subscriber's medical coverage (including enrolled dependents) will be terminated retroactive to the last day of the month for which the monthly premiums and any applicable premium surcharges were paid. A school employee who needs the required forms for an enrollment or benefit change may contact their SEBB organization. All other subscribers may contact the SEBB Program at 1 -800-200-1004. Medicare Eligibility and Enrollment If a school employee or their dependent becomes eligible for Medicare, they should contact the nearest Social Security Admin istration office to ask about the advantages of immediate or deferred Medicare enrollment. A school employee or their dependent are deemed eligible for Medicare when they have the option to receive Part A Medicare benefits. If a school employee or their dependent chooses to enroll in Medicare Part A, Medicare secondary payer regulations and guidelines will determine primary or secondary payer status. A school employee or their dependent who is enrolled in Medicare may remain enrolled in medical coverage. However, a school employee may choose to waive their SEBB medical plan or remove their dependent from their SEBB medical plan and choose Medicare as their primary insurer. If a school employee does so, the school employee or their dependent cannot enroll in SEBB medical. The school employee or their dependent can enroll again in SEBB medical during a special open enrollment or annual open enrollment. In most situations, a school employee and their dependent can elect to defer Medicare Part B enrollment without a penalty when the school employee terminates employment and enroll during a Special Enrollment Period. If Medicare eligibility is due to disability, the school employee or their dependent must contact the Social Security Administration about deferral of enrollment. If a SEBB Continuation Coverage subscriber or their dependent enrolls in Medicare, their medical coverage will terminate at the end of the month when they become eligible for Medicare due to turning age 65 or 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 135 older, or when enrolled in Medicare due to a disability. Federal regulations allow enrollment in Medicare up to three months before turning age 65. If the subscriber or their dependent do not enroll within three months before they turn age 65, enrollment in Medicare may be delayed. If enrollment in Medicare does not occur when the subscriber or their dependent is first eligible, a late enrollment penalty may apply. Upon retirement, Medicare will become the primary insurance, and the Public Employees Benefits Board (PEBB) medical pla n becomes secondary. See the section titled \"Option For Coverage Under PEBB Retiree Insurance.\" Options For Continuing SEBB Medical Coverage A subscriber and their dependents covered by this medical plan may be eligible to continue enrollment during temporary or permanent loss of eligibility. There are two continuation coverage options for a SEBB medical plan enrollee: 1. SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA) 2. SEBB Continuation Coverage (Unpaid Leave) These two options temporarily extend group insurance coverage when the enrollee's SEBB medical plan coverage ends due to a qualifying event. SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA) includes eligibility and administrative requirements under federal law and regulation and also includes coverage for some enrollees w ho are not qualified beneficiaries under federal COBRA continuation coverage. SEBB Continuation Coverage (Unpaid Leave) is an alternative created by the SEBB Program with wider eligibility criteria and qualifying event types. An enrollee who qualifies for both types of SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA and Unpaid Leave) may choose to enroll in only one of the options. For enrollment information, see the section titled \"How to Enroll.\" The SEBB Program must be notified in writing within 30 days if, after electing SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA), a subscriber or their dependent becomes eligible for Medicare (Part A, Part B, or both) or becomes covered under other group health plan coverage. If a subscriber or their dependent enrolls in SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA) and then becomes eligible for Medicare, their enrollment in SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA) will be terminated at the end of the month in which they become eligible for Medicare due to turning age 65 or older, or when enrolled in Medicare due to a disability. This may cause the SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA) to be terminated early, before the subscriber has used all the months they would otherwise be entitled to. A subscriber or their dependents who are already enrolled in Medicare when they enroll in SEBB Continuation Coverage (COBRA) will not have their coverage terminated early. The SEBB Program administers both continuation coverage options. Refer to the SEBB Continuation Coverage Election Notice for details. A subscriber also has the right of conversion to individual medical insurance coverage when continuation of group medical insurance coverage is no longer possible. The subscriber's dependents also have options for continuing insurance coverage for themselves after losing eligib ility. For more information, see the section titled \"Conversion of Coverage.\" Option for Coverage Under Public Employees Benefits Board (PEBB) Retiree Insurance A retiring school employee or a dependent becoming eligible as a survivor is eligible to contin ue enrollment or defer enrollment in Public Employees Benefits Board (PEBB) insurance coverage if they meet procedural and substantive eligibility requirements. See the PEBB Retiree Enrollment Guide for details. 136 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Transitional Continuation Coverage School employees and their dependents may gain temporary eligibility for SEBB benefits, on a self -pay basis, if they meet the following criteria: 1. A school employee and their dependents who are enrolled in medical, dental, or vision under a group plan offered by a SEBB organization on December 31, 2019, who lose eligibility because the school employee is not eligible for SEBB benefits, may elect to enroll in one or more of the following SEBB benefits: medical, dental, or vision coverage. These benefits will be provid ed for a maximum of 18 months. 2. A dependent of a SEBB eligible school employee who is enrolled in medical, dental, or vision under a school employee's account on December 31, 2019, who loses eligibility because they are not an eligible dependent may enroll in medical, dental, and vision for a maximum of 36 months. 3. A dependent of a school employee who is continuing medical, dental, or vision coverage through a SEBB organization on December 31, 2019, may elect to finish out their remaining months, up to the maximum number of months authorized by Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) for a similar event, by enrolling in a medical, dental, or vision plan offered through the SEBB Program. Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 A school employee on a pproved leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) may continue to receive the employer contribution toward SEBB benefits in accordance with the federal FMLA. The SEBB organization determines if the school employee is eligible for leave an d the duration of the leave under FMLA. The school employee must continue to pay the school employee monthly premium contribution and applicable premium surcharges during this period to maintain eligibility. If a school employee exhausts the period of lea ve approved under FMLA, they may continue SEBB insurance coverage by self -paying the monthly premium and applicable premium surcharges set by HCA, with no contribution from the SEBB organization. For more information on continuation coverage, see the section titled \"Options For Continuing SEBB Medical Coverage.\" Paid Family and Medical Leave Act A school employee on approved leave under the Washington State Paid Family and Medical Leave Program may continue to receive the employer contribution toward SEBB benefits in accordance with the Paid Family and Medical Leave Program. The Employment Security Department determines if the school employee is eligible for the Paid Family and Medical Leave Program. The school employee must continue to pay the school employee monthly premium contribution and applicable premium surcharges during this period to maintain eligibility. If a school employee exhausts the period of leave approved under the Paid Family and Medical Leave Program, they may continue SEBB insurance cove rage by self -paying the monthly premium and applicable premium surcharges set by HCA, with no contribution from the SEBB organization. For more information on continuation coverage, see the section titled \"Options For Continuing SEBB Medical Coverage.\" General Provisions Payment of premium during a labor dispute Any school employee or dependent whose monthly premiums are paid in full or in part by the SEBB organization may pay premiums directly to HCA if the school employee's compensation is suspended or terminated directly or indirectly as a result of a strike, lockout, or any other labor dispute for a period not to exceed six months. 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 137 While the school employee's compensation is suspended or terminated, HCA shall notify the school employee immediately, by ma il to the last address of record, that the school employee may pay premiums as they become due. If coverage is no longer available to the school employee under this certificate of coverage, then the school employee may be eligible to purchase an individual medical plan from this plan at a premium rate consistent with premium rates filed with the Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner. Conversion of coverage An enrollee (including a spouse and dependent of a subscriber terminated for cause) has the right to switch from SEBB group medical to an individual conversion plan offered by this plan when they are no longer eligible to continue the SEBB group medical plan and are not eligible for Medicare or covered under another group insurance coverage that provides benefits for hospital or medical care. An enrollee must apply for conversion coverage no later than 31 days after their group medical plan ends or within 31 days from the date the notice of termination of coverage is received, whichever is l ater. Evidence of insurability (proof of good health) is not required to obtain the conversion coverage. Rates, coverage, and eligibility requirements of our conversion program differ from those of the enrollee's current group medical plan. To receive detailed information on conversion options under this medical plan, call us at 1 -800-628-3481. Appeal rights Any current or former school employee of a SEBB organization or their dependent may appeal a decision made by the SEBB organization regardi ng SEBB eligibility, enrollment, or premium surcharges to the SEBB organization. Any enrollee may appeal a decision made by the SEBB Program regarding SEBB eligibility, enrollment, premium payments, or premium surcharges to the SEBB Appeals Unit.

Members may self -refer to most specialists . Allowed amount, medical services Allowed amount for medical services is the most the plan pays for a specific covered service or supply. Allowed amount, prescription drugs The allowed amount for prescription drugs is based on WSRxS' contractually agreed reimbursement, unless other contractual arrangements or terms apply. All covered prescription drug claims are paid based on thi s allowed amount. Ambulatory surgery center (ASC) An ambulatory surgery center (ASC) is a health care facility that specializes in providing surgery, pain management, and certain diagnostic services in an outpatient setting. ASC -qualified procedures are typically more complex than those done in a doctor's office but not so complex as to require an overnight stay. Procedures commonly performed in these centers include colonoscopies, endoscopies, cataract surgery, orthopedic, and ENT (ear, nose, and throat) procedures. An ASC may also be known as an outpatient surgery center or same- day surgery center. Annual open enrollment Annual open enrollment is a period of time defined by HCA when a subscriber may change to another health plan offered by the SEBB Program and make certain other account changes for an effective date beginning January 1 of the following year. Appeal See the \"Complaint and appeal procedures\" section for an explanation of appeals and how the process works. Authorized representative An authorized representative is someone you have designated in writing to communicate with the plan on your behalf. See page 141 for how this works. Balance billing Balance billing is a provider billing you for the difference between the billed amount and the allowed amount. Core and support network providers cannot balance bill you for covered services above the allow ed amount. See an example of how this works on page 18. At a network facility, when you receive surgery, anesthesia, pathology, radiology, laboratory, or hospitalis t services from an out -of-network provider at a network hospital or network ambulatory surgical facility in Washington, you cannot be balance billed. At an out -of-network facility, when you receive emergency services you cannot be balance billed. 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 145 Birthda y rule In some instances, the birthday rule is used to determine which group health plan will pay first for the dependent children of married, living together and not married, legally separated, or divorced parents. This rule looks at only the month and day, not the year, of the parents' birthdays. For example, the plan of a parent born April 14 is primary over the plan of a parent born August 21. If both parents have the same birthday, the plan that has covered either parent the longest is primary. Brand -name drug A brand -name drug is a prescription drug sold under the proprietary name or trade name selected by the manufacturer. Business day Business days are Mondays through Fridays, except for legal holidays observed by Washington State. Calendar day A calendar day is any day of the week regardless of whether it is observed as a legal holiday by Washington State. Calendar year A calendar year is January 1 through December 31. Chronic migraine A chronic migraine is having a headache on 15 or more days per mo nth of which eight or more days are a migraine. Clinical review Clinical review is when the plan has a clinical professional review medical records related to inpatient treatment to determine if inpatient treatment is medically necessary. Coinsurance Coinsurance is the percentage of the allowed amount you must pay the provider on claims for which the plan pays less than 100 percent of the allowed amount. This includes most medical services and prescription drugs. Continuation Coverage Continuation Cove rage means the temporary continuation of SEBB benefits available to enrollees under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), or SEB Board policies. Coordination of benefits (COB) For members covered by more than one group health plan, coordination of benefits (COB) is the method the plan uses to determine which plan pays first, which pays second, and the amount paid by each plan. S ee description and e xamples in the \"If you have other medical coverage\" section . 146 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Copay Copay is a set dollar amount you pay when receiving specific services, treatments, or supplies, such as chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy, inpatient hospitalization , or emergency r oom visits. Core network providers Core network providers are primary care providers (PCP), specialty providers, and facilities (such as hospitals, surgery centers, and clinics) contracted with UMP Plus- UW Medicine ACN . Cost-share Cost -share means the amou nt you pay for a service, supply, or prescription drug. This may be a deductible, coinsurance, copay, or amounts not covered by the plan. Custodial care Custodial care is care primarily to assist in activities of daily living, including institutional care primarily to support self -care and provide room and board. Custodial care includes, but is not limited to, help in walking, getting into and out of bed, bathing, dressing, feeding and preparing special diets, and supervising prescription drugs that are ordinarily self -administered. Deductible, medical The medical deductible is a fixed dollar amount you must meet each calendar year for health care expenses before the plan starts paying for covered services. You pay the first $125 per member in medical expen ses to your providers ($375 maximum if you have a family of three or more on one account). Only expenses covered by the plan apply to your deductible. For example, if you receive LASIK surgery (see exclusion on 100), the plan does not apply this payment to your medical deductible. Some services are exempt from this deductible (see the \"Summary of benefits\" section ). See page 27 for details on how the medical deductible works. Dependent A dependent is an eligible spouse, state -registered domestic partner, child, or other eligible family member as described in the eligibility section (see \"Eligibility\" on page 124) that is either covered by or eligible to be covered by the plan under the subscriber's account. Developmental delay Developmental delay is a significant lag in reaching developmental milestones as expected during infancy and early childhood. The cause may be present at birth or acquired after birth from a disease or disorder of the body, an injury, a disorder of the mind or emotions, or harmful effects of the surrounding environment. Only a physician or other provider may diagnose a developmental delay. Durable medical equipment (DME) Durable medical equipment (DME) is: Designed for prolonged use. For a specific therapeutic or clinical purpose, or to assist in the treatment of an injury or illness. Medically necessary (meeting all plan medical necessity criteria). Primarily and customarily used only for a medical purpose. 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 147 See page 100 for examples of equipment that is not covered. Effectiveness Effectiveness means the extent to which a specific intervention, procedure, service, level of service, supply, prescription drug, or drug dose may reasonably be expected to produce the intended results and to have expected benefits that outweigh potential harmful effects under real -world circumstances. Efficacy Efficacy is the extent to which a specific intervention, procedure, service, supply, or prescription drug produces th e desired effect under ideal conditions (in a controlled environment under lab circumstances). Emergency See the \"Medical emergency\" definition. Emergency fill Emergency fill is a process where the plan covers a limited amount of a prescription drug on an emergency basis while the plan processes your drug preauthorization request. Enrollee Enrollee means a person who meets all eligibility requirements and is enrolled in SEBB benefits, and for whom applicable premium payments have bee n made. Experimental or investigational Experimental or investigational means any treatment that is not recognized by the plan as conforming to standard medical care for the condition, disease, illness, or injury being treated. \"Treatment\" in this setting may include any intervention, therapy, procedure, facility, equipment, drug usage, device, service, supply, intervention, biologic product or drug (prescription or non -prescription). Experimental and investigational treatments are not covered, even if the treatment is considered medically necessary. The plan will review scientific evidence from well- designed clinical studies found in peer -reviewed medical literature, if available, and information obtained from the treating provider regarding the treatment t o determine if it is experimental or investigational. A treatment meeting any of the following criteria is considered experimental or investigational: Approval of the treatment or one of its components by one or more government agencies (e.g., FDA) is required but has not been obtained at the time the treatment is requested or administered. The improvement has not been shown to be attainable outside the laboratory or clinical research setting. The scientific evidence does not permit conclusions concerning the effect of the treatment on health outcomes, which include the disease process, injury or illness, length of life, ability to function, and quality of life. The scientific evidence does not show that the treatment is as beneficial as any established al ternatives. The treatment has not been demonstrated to improve net health outcomes. The treatment has scientific evidence to support its use, but not for the specific indication for which it is being requested. 148 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage The treatment is a drug or device that is prescribed for other than its FDA -approved use(s) and is not recognized as \"effective\" for the use for which it is being prescribed. To be considered \"effective\" for other than its FDA -approved use, a prescription drug or device must be so recognized in one o f the standard reference compendia or, if not, then in a majority of relevant peer -reviewed medical literature; or by the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services. The treatment is considered to be experimental or investigational by U.S. standards. The treatment is drug combination therapy, when the scientific literature only supports the drug's use as monotherapy and not when utilized in combination with other drugs. The treatment is drug monotherapy, when the scientific literature only supports the d rug's use when utilized in combination with other drugs. The treatment is not provided by a provider that has demonstrated medical proficiency in the provision of the treatment. The treatment is only available in the U.S. as part of a clinical trial or re search program for the illness or condition being treated. Although the plan does not pay for items, drugs, devices, or services (including items, drugs, devices, or services provided in a clinical trial) for investigational use, the plan does not deny qua lified individuals from participating in approved clinical trials. The terms \"qualified individual\" and \"approved clinical trial\" are defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7300gg -8. If a qualified individual is participating in an approved clinical trial, the plan will not deny, limit, or impose additional conditions on the coverage for routine patient costs for items and services furnished in connection with participation in the trial and will not discriminate against the individual on the basis of the individual's partic ipation in such trial. The plan will apply its standard terms and conditions for routine patient costs for items and services furnished in connection with participation in the trial. The treatment is the subject of an on -going phase I or phase II clinical trial or is the research, experimental, study, or investigational arm of an on -going phase III clinical trial. Explanation of Benefits (EOB) An Explanation of Benefits (EOB) is a detailed account of each medical claim processed by the plan, which the plan sends to you to notify you of claim payment or denial. You may also sign in to your Regence account at ump.regence.com/ump/signin or call UMP Customer Service at 1- 800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) to request a copy of an EOB. You will need to provide identifying information over the phone. Family Family is defined as all eligible family members (subscriber and dependents) who are enrolled on a single account. Fee schedule A fee schedule is a list of the plan's maximum payment amounts for specific services or supplies. Network providers have agreed to accept these fees as payment in full for services to members. See the definition of \"Allowed amount, medical services\" for more details. Formulary A formulary is a list available online that specifies how prescription drugs are covered by the plan. By using this list, you may find out if a prescription drug is covered, if the drug must be ordered through the plan's specialty drug pharmacy, and whether the drug has any limitations (such as needing preauthorization or quantity limits; see pages 87- 93). 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 149 The UMP Preferred Drug List is sometimes called a formulary (see the \"UMP Preferred Drug List\" section for more information ). Generic drug A generic drug is a prescription drug with the same active ingredient(s), but not necessarily the same inactive ingredients, as a brand -name drug that is no longer protected by a commercial patent. A generic drug is therapeutically equivalent to the brand -name prescription drug, which means it works like the brand -name drug in dosag e, strength, performance, and use. All generic drugs sold in the U.S. must be reviewed and approved by the FDA, and meet the same quality and safety standards as brand -name drugs. Generic equivalent A generic equivalent is a generic prescription drug that has the same active ingredients as its brand - name counterpart. For a generic drug to be considered \"equivalent,\" it has to be approved by the FDA as being interchangeable with that brand -name drug. Under Washington State law, the pharmacist is required to dispense a generic equivalent in place of a brand -name drug, unless your provider objects. See \"Substitution under Washington State Law\" on page 91 for how this wor ks. Gestational Parent The individual who carries the pregnancy and gives birth. Grievance A grievance is also called a complaint. See page 116 for details on how t hese are handled. Habilitative (neurodevelopmental) services Habilitative (neurodevelopmental) services are health care services that help you keep, learn, or improve skills and functioning for daily living. Examples include therapy for a child who isn't walking or talking at the expected age. These services may include physical and occupational therapy, sp eech - language pathology, and other services for people with disabilities in a variety of inpatient and/or outpatient settings. Health Care Authority (HCA) The Health Care Authority (HCA) is the Washington State agency that administers the Uniform Medical Plan UMP Achieve 1, UMP Achieve 2, UMP High Deductible, and the UMP Plus plans: UMP Plus -Puget Sound High Value Network and UMP Plus -UW Medicine Accountable Care Network), in addition to the following health care programs: Washington Prescription Drug Progr am, PEBB Program, SEBB Program, Behavioral Health and Recovery, and Apple Health (also known as Medicaid). Health intervention Health intervention is a prescription drug, service, or supply provided to prevent, diagnose, detect, treat, or palliate the following: disease, illness, injury, genetic or congenital anomaly, pregnancy, or biological or psychological condition that lies outside the range of normal, age -appropriate human variation. A health intervention may also maintain or restore functional ability. A health intervention is defined not only by the intervention itself, but also by the medical condition and patient indications for which it is being applied. A health intervention is new if it is not yet in widespread use for the medical condition and the patient indications being considered. 150 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Health outcomes Health outcomes are results that affect health status as measured by the length or quality (primarily as perceived by the member) of a person's life. High- cost generic drug High -cost generic drug i s a generic prescription drug (see the definition of \"Generic drug\") that the plan covers under Tier 2 (see table on page 78). Home health agency A home health agenc y is an agency or organization that: Provides a program of home health care; Practices within the scope of its license as a provider of home health services; and Is Medicare -certified, accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, or a network provider. Hospice Hospice is services provided by a state -licensed hospice program in the member's home or in a hospice facility to terminally ill members. Hospice care includes services such as pain care relief for terminally ill members without the intent to cure, and support services for their families. Hospital A hospital is an institution accredited under the Hospital Accreditation Program of the Joint Commission and licensed by the state where it is located. The term hospital does not include a convalescent nursing home or institution (or a part of one) that: Furnishes primarily domiciliary or custodial care. Is operated as a school. Is used principally as a convalescent facility, rest facility, nursing facility, or facility for the aged. Inpatient copay The inpatient copay is what you pay for inpatient services at a network facility, such as a hospital, or skilled mental health, nursing, or substance use disorder facility. Non -Medicare members pay $200 per day up to $600 maximum per member per calendar year. The inpatient copay does not apply to your medical deductible but does apply to the medical out -of-pocket limit. Professional charges, such as for physicians or lab work, may be billed separately and are not included in this copay. Inpatient rate The inpatient rate means that you pay your deductible and copay at network facilities After you have met your deductible and paid your copay, the plan pays 100 percent of the allowed amount. The plan pays for professional services, such as provider visits or lab tests, based on the provider's network status during an inpatient stay: 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 151 Network providers: You pay 15 percent of the allowed amount after you meet your medical deductible. The plan pays 85 percent of the a llowed amount. Note: For behavioral health professional services, the plan pays 100 percent of the allowed amount. Out- of-network providers: You pay 50 percent of the allowed amount after you pay your medical deductible. You pay all charges billed to you above the allowed amount (known as balance billing ). The plan pays 50 percent of the allowed amount. Inpatient stay An inpatient stay begins when you are admitted to a hospital or other medical facility, and ends when you are discharged from that facility. Independent review organization (IRO) An independent review organization (IRO) conducts the independent (or external) review of an appeal. An IRO is a group of medical and benefit experts certified by the Washington State Department of Health and not related to the plan, Regence BlueShield, WSRxS, or the Health Care Authority. An IRO is intended to provide unbiased, independent clinical and benefit expertise, as well as evidence -based decision making while ensuring confidentiality. The IRO reviews your appeal to determine if the plan's decision is consistent with state law and the applicable COC. The plan pays the IRO's charges. See \"E xternal review (independent review)\" on page 120. Limited benefit TIP: This definition applies only to those benefits in which it is used in this COC. Other benefits have additional limits related to medical necessity or preauthorization of services (see page 94). A limited benefit is a benefit that is limited to a certain number of visits or a maximum dollar amount. The limit applies to these benefits even if the provider prescribes additional visits and even if the visits are medically necessary. For benefits limited to a certain number of visits, any visits that are applied to your medical deductible also count against your annual visit or dollar limit. In addition, visits that are paid by another health plan that is primary apply to the plan limit. For example, if your primary plan applies your first 12 chiropractor sessions to your medical deductible, you may receive coverage for 12 more sessions in that calendar year, for a total of 24 visits (the visit maximum for chiropractic services). These limits apply per member. Services are counted against a limited benefit according to the type of service, not the provider type. When a provider practicing within the scope of their license provides services coded under a limited benefit (e.g., spinal manipulation or physical therapy), those services will be counted against the benefit regardless of the provider type. In addition, if more than one type of limited benefit service is provided during a single visit, the services will count against all the limited benefits. For example, if both manipulation and physical therapy codes are billed for a visit, that visit will count against both the spinal and extremity manipulation and physical therapy benefit limits. 152 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Maintenance care Maintenance care is a health intervention after the member has reached maximum rehabilitation potential or functional level and has shown no significant improvement for one to two weeks, and instruction in the maintenance program has been completed. Maintenance care may apply to sever al different services, including, but not limited to, physical therapy, speech therapy, neurodevelopmental therapy, home health care, and skilled nursing care. Medical Medical generally refers to all plan benefits and services other than those covered und er preventive care and prescription drug benefits (except as the term is used in the eligibility sections of this COC). Medical benefit Medical benefit refers to services subject to the medical deductible, and copay or coinsurance. See pages 27-31 for a description of how this works. Medical emergency A medical emergency mean s a medical condition that manifests itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) so that a prudent layperson who has an average knowledge of medicine and health would reasonably expect that not seeking immediate medical treatment at a n emergency room would result in any one of the following: Places the member's health, or with respect to pregnancy , the health of an unborn child, in serious jeopardy; Causes serious impairment to bodily functions; or Causes serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. Medical food Medical food is food administered under the supervision of a provider, intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional requirements. Medically necessary or medical necessity ALERT! The provider or member must provide documentation demonstrating medical necessity when requested by the plan, or the plan may deny services as not medically necessary. The plan may not cover some medically necessary services. All benefits or services that are medically necessary are subject to the plan's coverage limitations, exclusions, and provisions of the plan. It is important to review this COC or verify coverage with UMP Customer Service at 1- 800-628-3481 (TRS: 711) before receiving services. Medically necessary or medical necessity means health care services, supplies, prescription drugs, or interventions that a licensed health care provider recommends and all the following conditions are met: The purpos e of the service, supply, intervention, or prescription drug is to prevent, evaluate, treat, or diagnose an illness, injury, disease, or its symptoms. 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 153 The level of service, supply, intervention, prescription drug, or prescription drug dose is appropriate considering the potential benefits and harm to the member. The level of service, supply, intervention, prescription drug, or prescription drug dose is known to be effective in improving health outcomes. The level of service, supply, intervention, prescription drug, or prescription drug dose recommended for this condition is cost -effective compared to alternative interventions, including no intervention. The service, supply, or intervention is not being recommended for reasons of convenience to the patient or health care provider. For services that the HTCC has reviewed, and that UMP has implemented, medical necessity is established only when HTCC's coverage conditions are met. The fact that a physician or other provider prescribes, orders, recommends, or approves a service or supply, prescription drug, or prescription drug dose does not make it medically necessary. The plan may require proof that services, interventions, supplies, or prescription drugs (including court - ordered care) are medically necessary . Depending on the circumstances, such proof may be documentation about the member's condition or scientific evidence about the effectiveness of the treatment. The plan will not provide benefits if the required proof is not received, or does not adequately justify the medical necessity of the service, supply, prescription drug, or prescription drug dose. Claims processing may be delayed if proof of medical necessity is required but not adequately provided by the health service provider. The plan uses scientific evidence from peer -reviewed medical literature to determine effectiveness for services and interventions not yet in widespread use for the medical condition and member indications being considered. For services that the HTCC has reviewed, a nd that UMP has implemented, state law requires that UMP use the HTCC's coverage criteria in determining whether the service is medically necessary. When the HTCC determines that a service is not covered, then the service is not covered by the plan. If the HTCC determines that a service is covered, then the HTCC's criteria (if any) determine medical necessity. The HTCC's decisions and related documentation are available on the HCA website at hca.wa.gov/hta . For services, interventions, supplies, prescription drugs, or prescription drug doses not related to an HTCC review, the plan first uses scientific evidence, then professional standards, then expert opinion to determine coverage. Scientific evidence consists primarily of controlled clinical trials that either directly or indirectly demonstrate the effect of the intervention on health outcomes. If controlled clinical trials are not available, observation al studies that demonstrate a causal relationship between the intervention and health outcomes may be used. Partially controlled observational studies and uncontrolled clinical series may be suggestive, but do not by themselves demonstrate a causal relationship unless the magnitude of the effect observed exceeds anything that could be explained either by the natural history of the medical condition or potential experimental biases. Interventions for which clinical trials have not been conducted because of e pidemiological reasons (that is, rare or new diseases or orphan populations) shall be evaluated based on professional standards of care or expert opinion. A level of service, supply, prescription drug, prescription drug dose, or intervention is considered cost effective if the benefits and harms relative to the costs represent an economically efficient use of resources for members with this condition. The plan applies this criterion based on the individual member's medical situation and characteristics. Cos t-effective does not always mean the lowest price. 154 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage Preventive services not covered by the plan's preventive care benefit will still be covered under the medical benefit or prescription drug benefit if the outlined criteria are met for medical necessity. Member A member is an eligible school employee, former school employee or former dependent in Continuation Coverage, or dependent enrolled in the plan (see also the \"Enrollee\" definition). Network Network is the facilities, providers, and suppliers your health plan contracts with to provide health care services.

You may find out which pharmacies are contracted on the UMP website at ump.regence.com/sebb/benefits/prescriptions or by calling WSRxS Customer Service at 1 -888-361-1611 (TRS: 711). Noncovered prescription drugs Noncovered prescription drugs refer to any drug that is only covered by the member receiving an exception from the plan. Some drugs may be medically necessary, yet still are not covered. See the \"Prescription drugs and products UMP does not cover\" section. 2022 UMP Plus -UW Medicine ACN (SEBB) Certificate of Coverage 155 Noncovered services Noncover ed services refers to any medical service that is not covered by the plan. Some services may be medically necessary, yet still are not covered. See the \"What the plan does not cover\" section. When the HTCC determines that a service is not covered, then the service is not covered by the plan . Nonduplication of benefits Nonduplication of benefits is how UMP coordinates benefits when UMP is your secondary coverage. When another plan is primary (pays first), that plan pays their normal benefit. UMP then pays up to the amount we would have paid if UMP had been the primary plan. If the primary plan pays as much or more than the normal UMP benefit, UMP pays nothing. UMP does not pay the rest of the allowed amount. See examples on page 110. Non- network pharmacy A non- network pharmacy does not contract with WSRxS. See page 84 for what hap pens if you use a non- network pharmacy to purchase covered prescription drugs. Nonprescription alternative A nonprescription alternative includes an over -the-counter drug, dietary supplement, herbal supplement, vitamin, mineral, medical food, or medical de vice that you may buy without a prescription that has similar safety, efficacy, and ingredients as a prescription drug.
