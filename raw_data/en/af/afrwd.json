The explanations on this page is from Will himself. Explanations[ ] Havok Be Thy Game[ ] Havok Be Thy Game is the first track on Goliath's Throne and is a continuation from [Heart of an Artist](/wiki/Heart_of_an_Artist) to keep the story going. For Heart of an Artist, we sort of brought the idea that there was this troubled soul that has been going through many, many different stories of his life and was finally able to come out to the other side and now we're starting to see his rise. This is his Havok. The spelling is not a mistake. It is intentional. \"Havok\" is the word that we're using to describe the colony of his up-rise. It's his colony. They are Havok. After all those years of turmoil and pain, it's time for him to rise up again. That's Havok Be Thy Game. Hibernation[ ] Hibernation is the second track. This describes Goliath's year of isolation away from life and how this person who used to be dealing with all these troubles has now gone to sleep in a slumber and now is willing to wake up again after that as a completely new beast. He's not a force to be reckoned with. He is not to be messed with. He is out there to kill any toxicity that is headed his way. This is the description of somebody stepping away for a long period of time and coming back as a totally different person. Maybe not totally different like not losing too much moral compass along the way but, healing, so to speak, from all the wounds that have been given over the lifetime he's had. I'm the Animal[ ] TBA Corporate Pain[ ] I think this album definitely demonstrates the idea of emotional torment as well as rising up against money. This is the idea that money... it's essential to live, but by using it as our fuel is a very greedy campaign and has, at least in my experiences and probably a lot of my friends experiences, ruined a lot of friendships and a lot of foundation in terms of chemistry. Money has been able to abuse people and put people under turmoil and, you know, Goliath has been out there in the open. People know him. People have seen his turmoil and will now capitalise on that. That is the corporate pain. Cold Man[ ] TBA Surveillance[ ] TBA Trojan[ ] Trojan! That's a very easy song to talk about because I've spoken about this so many times: the ideal of bias. The ideal of hearing one piece of information from one person and disregarding any other piece of information that anybody has mentioned to form your final opinion. It's a virus. It's ruined a lot of my friendships. There's a lot of people in my life who've believed in something so harshly only for it to be a different thing. Actually, cancel culture describes that completely and drama describes that completely and exposure on the internet describes that so discretely. It's a virus. Trojan is the very embodiment of that and if we don't end up- 'cause there is a cure. We can listen to the other side. We can be a bit more open, not judged by book of a cover, focus pure and hard on getting the truth and not just something you wanna hear. That's where I feel as though that's the vaccination. That's the cure. But nobody's doing that. So, forever in a day that's what we're seeing: it's Trojan. It's a virus... and it's spreading. Bloody Ether[ ] Bloody Ether touches on cyberbullying and suicide. This one had a large backstory. I've seen a lot of people fall under through cyberbullying. The blood signifies the death, the [ether](/wiki/Ether) describes the Internet and that's what made the idea for snakes to be in the album cover. Those are his [ether snakes](/wiki/Ether_Snakes) and, you know, we all have them. We all have been there and probably not intentionally done something crazy in the first place, but we have to normally be careful about what our words are on the line and who we speak to because we could damage someone. We could kill him and we don't want another piece of blood on our hands. We just don't don't want anymore. But, we also can't afford to care too much and that's what the world is at the moment. It's also the idea that there's always a helping hand. There's always someone out who's wanting to turn the lights on for you because we're all in a pretty bad place. So, we need to get out and what better way to do that than by your close friends and family? There was a music video idea for this, but I, you know, I'm procrastinating. This is probably the only bit of information you'll get out of that. You're Better Off[ ] You're Better Off is... It definitely comes from a place from my own experiences. I've always felt like I'm better off. I've always felt like people are better off without me. Especially those who deal with a lot of life circumstances, a lot of depression. A lot of anxiety can ruin a lot of foundations around everybody else. It brings down the mood. It makes people worry so much. It makes them stop eating and sleeping and it gives you that anxiety that you're always so much better with them having a peaceful life without you and you could just hide in the shadows and just disappear. That's an anxiety I've always suffered with. That song was written in a place where I legitimately felt like that. The song does segway into the understanding that these are all just anxieties, 'cause that's what anxieties are: just anxieties. They're your worst case scenario playing in your head constantly and if you don't fix that, it can really get you into some strange places. That's why I always recommend cognitive behavioral therapy or any therapist for that matter who can handle your emotions very well and also just trust in your friends. They don't want you gone. Nobody wants you gone. Nobody's better off without anybody. Except for murderers and pedophiles and terrorists, you know, that's self-explanatory, but decent hardworking people who are doing innocent things and stuff that isn't really too maliceful. I think everybody deserves a chance, so that song is in the aid of that. It's a representation of anxiety, but also allowing you to know that it is only that and we all love you.
