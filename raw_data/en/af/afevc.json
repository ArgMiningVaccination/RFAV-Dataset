About a week into it now and no idea what sparked it. I am I an area that has been dealing with the horrid cold front and low pressure system, and have had head pressure and mild headache lately, so that could be a possible cause. I don't have any covid symptoms that I can tell, and have not really interacted with anyone outside my immediate family for the last 10 days or so. It is certainly very frustrating that this keeps happening. It's definitely louder and much more noticeable lately, a definite spike. Anybody else having a spike in their tinnitus that they think is from this winter weather situation? my head pressure and headache and also increased sensitive hearing started 6 days before I tested positive. Also I found once the cold weather came on I noticed my head pressure did increase. But I didn't notice a increase in tinnitus. During my COVID infection I did notice increase in headaches and head pressure. Then I learned from more than 5 coworker and my In laws that their pressures lasted some time after their covid infection. have you thought of trying your ssri's? Are you sleeping well? Check out mountainmomma and Josephduncans posts on their profiles they both took an ssri and it helped with their symptoms. Just seems like hope. I know that doesn't really help, All the best. sorry I just realized that Amitriptyline is not an ssri it's under the class drug TCA which is a tricyclic antidepressant. It's used for migraine treatment. Something a nurse practitioner recommended I try. I'm thinking about it. Update: Over the past 2-3 weeks I've developed a chronic \"fullness\" feeling in my head/ears, accompanied by a dull headache and sore neck muscles that go up the back on my neck and into my head/skull. That seems to have produced another spike in my tinnitus; the same high pitch electronic-type sound you'd get from an old TV set. It is very much the same as my first on-set almost a year ago. This is really giving me a lot of anxiety, with the feeling that this is going to be a permanent condition that may continue to get worse if the vaccine and/or my immune system antibodies keep attacking cells in my auditory system. Does anybody have a similar experience and were you able to resolve the tinnitus to any degree? What, if anything, helped? I am taking several vitamins (C, D3, B12) as well as Zinc and a Magnesium Glycinate supplement. I was hoping that as time wore on that this would resolve itself (i.e. due to inflammation that takes time to heal), but now I'm resigned to this being a permanent result of the damn mRNA vaccines. Hey, 27 year old male with no prior health issues as well. I'm having the same HR problems with it jumping higher than normal with any kind of exercise or activity and it dropping in low 40s when relaxed or sleeping. Just seeing if you ever found any relief or the doctors came up with anything? Thanks, have you had an mri of your heart? Ask for one!!ask if contrast would be recommended Update: Over the past 2-3 weeks I've developed a chronic \"fullness\" feeling in my head/ears, accompanied by a dull headache and sore neck muscles that go up the back on my neck and into my head/skull.

I've been experiencing the same thing since i had covid it just comes and goes in waves I've taken a week off of work just to be far away from the uncontrolled noisy environment. I spoke with my np and she consulted with the neurologist I usually see he wrote me a script for prednisone for 5 days. And then once that's done I'm going to see how I feel and then hopefully try the Amitriptyline for a couple of weeks. Have you thought about going back to your GP to see what else they can do for your symptoms? this whole vaccine thing is frustrating. My tinnitus really bothers me as well. But right now it's the hearing sensitivity that's bothering me the most. I can't be in the same room at my family for long periods due to the noise they make and just really hurts my ears I do wear a cotton in my ear to block out some noise but it doesn't block sudden noise. So far what I read in this forum what helped : serc - I've seen a couple of posts that taking this for a couple of months helped with tinnitus and dizziness, it's a drug used for mineres disease. Serc works by improving the blood flow of the inner ear and restoring it to normal. Which makes me believe that our inner ear parts or part aren't getting enough blood flow because of the inflammation. I say that because of my experience with my hearing sensitivity when I'm moving and doing things hence blood flood is faster and higher in my body so does that mean my head and inner ear parts are getting more blood flow just from moving?? I did try serc in the beginning but I don't know if it helped as I was isolated in my bedroom in the beginning when all this took place, it kinda made me feel nauseous. I would like to try this one too if nothing else works. prednisone- an anti inflammatory med for inflammation. Can increase blood glucose if diabetic. Also long term use can cause thinning of bones. But if you're going to be on it for a short period it shouldn't experience those affects. This medication really did show some improvement not 100% but some. However covid caused me to have a relapse that was like January 2022 again when this all started. So I'm hoping the prednisone helps reduce some inflammation. Nac- natural supplement used for mucus, and inflammation. I haven't tried this supplement personally. have you tried a strict low carb high anti oxidants diet? Another thing I read was fasting. There was a lady and a gentlemen tried the fasting and they felt like the inflammation was just melting away. One noticed a reduction in their tinnitus. Maybe if your type in fasting in the search you might find their posts. Anyway just thought I'd share that with you. I know how frustrated you are. I still get brain fog and have a bad eye that doesn't seem to work with my other eye when looking at a distance or up close. But keep trying things you're doing a good thing by taking supplements. I wish ppl would come back to this forum with recovery stories and share what they did. Some did but when I messaged them for more information they don't respond I just feel like the left out details can be pretty important in terms of what they did or how they did it. Also I developed chest pain or palpitations, from covid I believe either that or from the increase sensitivity is causing stress on my body? Not sure. I just hope that passes so I can go back to work cuz I'm not ready to be at home again for a long period. Hopefully someone can share some info that may help. [Thisistoomuch](https://vestibular.org/participant/margaret2022/) I had J&J last July, and it was terrible. But, things have improved. Here's what happened and what I've done. Within days of the shot, I had severe tinnitus and extremely sensitive ears. Felt like I was driving 90 miles an hour with my head out the window. There was a lot of pressure in my head. I had difficulty focusing my eyes on anything, and it was really difficult to think clearly for any prolonged period of time. I certainly couldn't read well and retain anything. And, for a few weeks, I had shooting nerve pain in my face and neck. I was initially prescribed prednisone, and it helped some. But the symptoms crept back in (although not as severe) by late September. More steroids knocked it back, but by the end of December, I wasn't feeling great again. My vision got really bad, and I've always been 20/20. I began working out steadily primarily to burn off the stress that came from wondering if I permanently screwed myself up with the shot. That helped with the anxiety. But my symptoms largely vanished after doing a 7 day water fast. Within 2 days, the tinnitus was gone, and my vision was perfect somewhere between 3-4 days. I felt better than I had in years by the end of the week. I also take 750 mg of Curamed curcumin daily, as well as a blend of lions mane and reishi mushrooms. Occasionally I'll still get a little ringing in my ears, but by and large, I feel much better. I'm not a medical professional, so take this all as just my personal experience. Fasting was not easy, but I could certainly tell my body was healing itself. Inflammation seemed to melt away. I plan to fast 3-4 times per year going forward just for general well being. Hope this helps someone. I will say, anxiety can be incredibly toxic for your body, so please don't overlook this aspect of our collective experience. how are you now? [@margaret2022]i can understand what you are going through. We will overcome this one day. Please be positive. I did do the antibodies test once again after my 42 day course of vedicinals. N the current range is 3350 Au/ml. I am really confused if all our symptoms are something to do with antibody or no. I have never got a proper response from the doctors. My hubby too did his antibodies test, just to figure out where it stands & his range is 31000Au/ml. Touchwood, he has no such issues. But this antibodies stuff is oh so confusing. Can someone throw light on this pls hello any updates ? How did the vedicinials go? Are you feeling better? [@stars182]Yes it went from a horrendous screech to a bearable high pitched hiss and stayed that way . hi how are things? Any improvements with the tinnitus? Hope you are well? I had no improvement. But also on the other hand I didn't have any worsening. Same thing and I'm having to deal with it as best I can. And you any improvement? Have you tried any new medicine? Thanks for asking, I hope you're well too. [@stars182]Yes it went from a horrendous screech to a bearable high pitched hiss and stayed that way . hi how are things?

And you any improvement? Have you tried any new medicine? Thanks for asking, I hope you're well too. @star182: Sorry to hear that you have not had any more improvement in your tinnitus. It sounds like you and I have the same issue. Mine it like a high-pitch electrical hiss that is constant and primarily in my right ear. Over the past year I've had a few periods where it seemed like it was resolving but then I would get another spike. My recent spike seems to be the worse and I'm hoping that doesn't mean that the vaccine or my immune system is continuing to cause damage. I don't want to over-dramatize it as it's not a life-threatening disease, but it is a very unpleasant thing to live with and is certainly impacting my quality of life. What things (vitamins, supplements, treatments, etc.) did you try? Are you pretty much resigned to the fact that the damage from the vaccine is permanent? What have any doctors that you've seen had to say? I'm sure there are success stories out there but people don't seem to bother to come back on here and let the rest of us know. Thanks and take care.

Hopefully someone can share some info that may help. @margaret2022: Thanks so much for your reply and input. Yes, this is very frustrating and as time goes on it's more difficult to be positive about any real end to this. I have read a couple of the posts of people who fasted. I may someday try that but not sure I have the will power for that. Never tried or was prescribed prednisone. Most of what I have read about it is that many people got temporary relief from it but the tinnitus came right back after they stopped taking it. I'll keep taking the supplements, even if they don't help with the tinnitus they are still good for you (I guess). What's interesting to me is that my tinnitus seems to be connected to when I get really sore neck muscles, that go up the back of my head, and cause a chronic dull headache and a full feeling in my head. I'm wondering if those are flair-ups when my immune system is disrupting/impacting the Vagus nerve and up into my auditory system. Who knows, certainly the medical community doesn't. And to just add insult to injury, I know I need to get back on my SSRI for anxiety but I'm too afraid of making the tinnitus worse since SSRIs are ototoxic and are known to cause/exacerbate tinnitus. I can't risk that. So this vaccine crap has impacted my life in more ways than one. Thanks again for your reply. Keep me posted on your situation and let us know what meds or treatments you try and if they work or not. Let's hope that 2023 is a better year for all of us on this forum. Question for everyone: We all know \"what\" happened to us and our bodies from the Covid vaccines. Has anyone received ant information for a medical professional as to \"how\" the vaccines did this to us? It's been a good 2 years and it's frustrating and, honestly unacceptable, that the medical community continues to be silent and/or ignorant about all of the horrid unintended adverse effects that people are suffering from. And I get incensed every time I see them hocking a new booster with the generic statement that they are \"safe and effective\" Having to get a new booster every 6 months is certainly not effective, and can't be good for our body and immune system. These vaccines and our immune system response are obviously reaching areas of the body far from the site of injection and having damaging effects, including cardio-pulmonary, neurological, audio-vestibular, ocular, etc. I just want this to be acknowledged with some answers, which I'm sure we'll never get because they fear litigation. We need to keep letting people know that this has and continues to be happening and needs to be addressed. Sorry for the rant, I just feel like we're all being ignored and treated like acceptable collateral "}
