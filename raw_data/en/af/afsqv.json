Neanidis Economics, University of Manchester, United Kingdom and Centre for Growth and Business Cycle Research First complete draft: April 27, 2009 This version: January 4, 2009 Abstract This paper examines the e\u00a4ect of humanitarian aid on the rates of fertility and economic growth in recipient countries. We develop a two-period overlapping generations model where reproductive agents face a non-zero probability of death in childhood. As adults, agents allocate their time to work, leisure, and child rearing activities of surviving children. Health status in adulthood exhibits \u0093state dependence\u0094as it depends on health in childhood. Humanitarian aid in\u0087 uences the probability of survival to adulthood, health in childhood, and the time adults allocate to child rearing, giving rise to an ambiguous e\u00a4ect on both the rates of fertility and growth. An empirical examination for the period 1973-2007 suggests that humanitarian aid has on average a zero e\u00a4ect on both the fertility rate and the rate of per capita output growth. The ndings are robust to a wide number of sensitivity considerations. Keywords : Aid; I12;O41 11 Introduction Recent years have witnessed a substantial increase in the number of studies explor- ing the relationship between foreign aid and economic growth. These studies, in their majority, assume that the way in which aid manifests and impacts on the economy is through the accumulation of physical or human capital (or a combination of the two). From these, the studies that highlight the human capital creation channel largely ne- glect the potential link between aid and demographic transitions in recipient nations. In light of the importance of a demographic transition for a transition in growth regimes within the uni ed growth theory, however, the likely e\u00a4ect of aid on fertility requires to be investigated. To this extent, this paper develops a theoretical framework comple- mented with an empirical analysis that jointly examines the impact of humanitarian aid on the levels of fertility and economic growth, thus o\u00a4ering a connection between aid and growth that relates to demographic considerations. The aid-growth literature can be largely divided into two strands, the unconditional and the conditional.1The rst, advocates that aggregate aid has on average a positive growth e\u00a4ect either with or without diminishing returns (Hansen and Tarp (2001), Daalgard et al. (2004), and Economides et al. (2008)), while the second supports that aggregate aid impacts upon growth - either positively or negatively - only when particular conditions are in place. These conditions have been originally thought to re\u0087 ect a good macroeconomic policy environment as captured by the recipient coun- try\u0092 s monetary, scal, and trade policies (Burnside and Dollar (2000)). A number of subsequent studies, however, have shown this nding to be fragile (see, for instance, Easterly et al. (2004) and Roodman (2004)) and suggested alternative recipient coun- try characteristics as being important for the success (or failure) of foreign aid. Of these, the most in\u0087 uential are the timing of distributing aid during a negative terms of trade shock (Collier and Dehn (2001)) and after an armed civil con\u0087 ict (Collier and Hoe\u00ad er (2002)), the geographic/tropical location of the recipient nation (Daalgard et al. (2004)), and, more recently, the power of the recipient\u0092 s economic elites (Angeles and Neanidis (2009)). In addition, some other studies have examined the growth e\u00a4ect of di\u00a4erent categories of aid, as these are represented by the short-impact, long-impact, and humanitarian aid (Clemens et al. (2003)), geostrategic and non-geostrategic aid (Headey (2007)), tied and untied aid (Miquel-Florensa (2007)), and productive and pure aid (Chatterjee et al. (2003), Minoiu and Reddy (2009), and Neanidis and Var- varigos (2009)). At the same time, development theorists view fertility considerations as an inte- gral part of the transition process from a near-zero steady state growth regime to one with positive rates of growth. This mechanism dates back to Becker (1960) where fertility decisions are based on a quantity-quality tradeo\u00a4 for children. This tradeo\u00a4 arises because the utility of parents depends both on the number of children and on 1Clemens et al. (2004) o\u00a4er an excellent review of the two groups, while Doucouliagos and Paldam (2008) o\u00a4er a meta-analysis of the literature. 2their quality, as captured by their level of human capital. Given that human capi- tal accumulation arises through investments in education, and that both child rearing activities and education are costly, a tradeo\u00a4 emerges. In this context, the idea that changes in mortality largely determine fertility outcomes nds a natural framework to make educational investment more attractive, and, therefore, lead parents to choose child quality over child quantity. This, in turn, causes a simultaneous decline in fer- tility and an increase in human capital accumulation and growth, thus providing a link between transitions in demography and growth. Recent contributions along these lines include Galor and Weil (2000), Blackburn and Cipriani (2002), Kalemli-Ozcan (2003), Moav (2005), Cervellati and Sunde (2005), and Azarnert (2006). More re- cently, however, some studies have considered human capital accumulation not as a function of educational attainment but as a function of investments in health. In this way, life expectancy depends on health expenditures made from either the government (Chakraborty (2004)) or the individuals themselves (Bhattacharya and Qiao (2007)). This paper jointly studies the impact of humanitarian aid on the rates of fertility and economic growth of recipient nations, and in this way o\u00a4ers a combination of the two abovementioned literatures. Our theoretical analysis builds upon the contribution of Ag\u00e9nor (2009) but is most closely related in nature to Azarnert (2008). Ag\u00e9nor (2009) develops a three-period OLG model, which although allows fertility choices to be endogenous as in the previous literature, it abstracts from human capital accumulation. In this case, the quantity-quality tradeo\u00a4 of children that arises does not depend on the fertility and educational choices of parents but on the choice between fertility and the time parents allocate to child rearing activities. Thus, the endogeneity of life expectancy is directly related to health status, rather than human capital arising from educational choices. Given that the health status of children depends on parents child rearing time, the latter is indirectly productive since not only it improves childrens\u0092 health but also their health later in life. As a result, time allocated to child care is treated endogenously. In addition, the paper accounts for the fact that health outcomes in childhood may a\u00a4ect health outcomes in adulthood. It also assumes that it is \u0093e\u00a4ective\u0094labor that is used in production; and individuals can provide e\u00a4ective labor services only if they are healthy. In this way, by enhancing productivity, health status in\u0087 uences growth indirectly. Therefore, persistence in health gives rise to a sustainable equilibrium of on going growth. Azarnert (2008), on the other hand, represents the rst study to simultaneously tackle the in\u0087 uence of foreign aid on population growth and human capital accumula- tion. By distinguishing two types of aid, per adult and per child, he shows that both categories increase fertility by reducing the quantity cost of children. As an outcome, parents invest less in the education of their o\u00a4springs leading to a slowdown in human capital accumulation, which may even lock the recipient economy in a poverty trap. Azarnert (2008), therefore, draws a relatively gloom picture of the e\u00a4ects of human- itarian aid. At the same time, however, he neglects the potentially bene cial impact of this type of aid on the rate of survival from childhood to adulthood as documented by a number of studies (Hu\u00a4 and Jimenez (2003), De Waal etal. (2006), and Plumber 3and Neumayer (2009)). In addition, his analysis abstracts from the promoting e\u00a4ect of aid on children\u0092 s health status through the greater intake of (nutritious) food and of vaccination campaigns (see, for instance, Kraak et al. (1999) and the Center for Global Development Brief (2007)). Accounting for these considerations in our model allows us to provide a more complex e\u00a4ect of humanitarian aid that gives rise to con\u0087 icting in\u0087 uences on both fertility and economic growth. Such an impact is also consistent with the empirical evidence provided in this paper.2 In particular, our theoretical analysis is a simpli ed version of Ag\u00e9nor (2009) that also incorporates humanitarian aid. It is a two-period OLG model that accounts for the endogeneity of parent\u0092 s time allocation to child rearing activities, and in this way allows them to internalize the impact of their decisions.3As in Azarnert (2008), aid is allocated to every adult and child in the economy. Unlike him, however, only per adult aid comes in monetary form. Per child aid is in kind to re\u0087 ect the \u0087 ows of food, medication, and vaccinations o\u00a4ered by donors. It is this type of aid that raises the probability of a child\u0092 s survival to the next period of life (adulthood), thereby reducing fertility, while at the same time contributes directly to children\u0092 s health status. This in turn, has a positive e\u00a4ect on growth. Monetary per-adult aid, on the other hand, and consistent with Azarnert (2008), increases fertility by reducing the quantity cost of children, thereby shifting resources from quality of children to quantity. At the same time it reduces the child-rearing time of adults, which in turn lowers the health status of both children and adults, and subsequently the rate of economic growth. Therefore, the e\u00a4ect of humanitarian aid on both the rates of fertility and growth of per worker output in our model, and in contrast to Azarnert (2008), is found to be ambiguous. Given the ambiguity of the theoretical analysis, we resort to an empirical evalu- ation of these e\u00a4ects. The empirical analysis considers 66 aid-recipient nations and undertakes static and dynamic panel data estimations over the period 1973-2007 (in four-year period averages). We estimate the e\u00a4ects of humanitarian aid, as this is proxied by the classi cation methodology of Clemens etal. (2004) and Neanidis and Varvarigos (2009), on both the fertility rate and rate of per capita output growth. The empirical methodology considers both reduced form estimations and joint estimations of the fertility and growth equations. Our results suggest that humanitarian aid has on average a zero impact on both the rate of fertility and the rate of output growth, implying that the two con\u0087 icting e\u00a4ects of humanitarian aid outlined by our theoret- ical illustration fully o\u00a4set each other. An exception to this general nding, pointing to a positive fertility e\u00a4ect, is documented for the countries that have not yet experi- enced the demographic transition characterized by high fertility rates. These ndings are robust to the inclusion of a wide number of sensitivity considerations including 2Azarnert (2008) also provides some preliminary empirical evidence, which however is not system- atically conducted with regression techniques. 3This is quite important because the time allocated to child care is quite signi cant in developing countries\u0097 around one hour a day in most cases, but between one and two hours in countries like Bangladesh, Botswana, Kenya, and the Philippines (see Brown and Haddad (1995)) and up to three hours in a country like Nicaragua (see Ilahi (2000)). 4di\u00a4erent estimation and instrumentation techniques, exclusion of outliers, alternative measures of aid, regression speci cations, aid-interaction e\u00a4ects, and alternative period averaging. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical analysis, setting out and solving our model economy to establish the key implications. It also o\u00a4ers a robustness test to our main results by adding a third type of aid, monetary assistance for each child, as also done by Azarnert (2008). Section 3 contains the empirical analysis, describing our methodology and data, presenting our basic ndings and reporting on the results of extensive robustness tests. Section 4 contains a few concluding remarks. 2 Theory Consider a small OLG economy in which activity extends over an in nite discrete time period. In every period one homogeneous good is produced, which can be only consumed in that period, with labor as the single input. In each generation individuals live (at most) for two periods: childhood and adulthood. Each individual is endowed with one unit of time in childhood and two units in adulthood. Children depend on their parents for consumption and health care. Adults supply inelastically one unit of labor at a determined wage rate, which serves to nance consumption in adulthood and raise children. Adult agents also receive a permanent \u0087 ow of monetary aid from external donors. In adulthood, each individual becomes a parent and bears nchildren. All children are born with the same innate abilities and the same initial health status. However, keeping children healthy involves a cost, both in terms of the parent\u0092 s time and spending on marketed goods (food, medicines, etc.). Adults must decide on the allocation of their non-work unit of time between child rearing and leisure. At the beginning of the rst period of life there is a non-zero probability of dying, which is decreasing in the amount of in kind (food and medical) aid consumed. The health status of children and adults are taken to depend on di\u00a4erent determinants, in line with the evidence of Cutler et al. (2006). For children, health status depends on the time parents allocate to rearing their o\u00a4spring, on in kind aid, and on the par- ent\u0092 s health. The latter e\u00a4ect is consistent with the evidence provided by Powdthavee and Vingoles (2008) for Britain, suggesting that parents\u0092physical and mental health (beyond short-term stress and strain) a\u00a4ects their children\u0092 s well-being.4For adults, health status is taken to depend on health status in childhood indicating \u0093state depen- dence\u0094in health outcomes. This speci cation is consistent with the evidence of Case et al. (2005), according to which children who experience poor health have on average 4Alternatively, it could be assumed that cognitive and physical impairments of children may begin in utero , due to inadequate nutrition and poor health of the mother. The importance of the prenatal environment is supported by Bloom and Canning (2005) who estimate that 30 million infants are born each year in developing countries with impaired growth due to poor nutrition during fetal life. 5signi cantly poorer health as adults. Finally, all markets clear and there are no debts or bequests between generations. 2.1 Population LetNtbe the number of adults in period t. Given that at the beginning of their adult life in t, each individual bears ntchildren, the total number of children born at the beginning of that period is ntNt.5The probability of survival from childhood to adulthood (at the beginning of period t) is denoted by pt2(0;1). For tractability, we do not account explicitly for the random nature of the number of surviving children; the number of surviving children is simply given by the expected number of survivors. To avoid convergence of population size toward zero, we assume that ptnt\u00151. All these imply that the number of surviving children is ptntNt. Thus, total population at the beginning of period tis(1 +ptnt)Nt. Moreover, the number of adults alive in periodtis equal to the number of children born in the previous period, Nt\u00001nt\u00001, who survived to period t, that is, Nt=pt\u00001Nt\u00001nt\u00001: (1) Aggregate population at the beginning of period t,Lt, is thus Lt= (1 +ptnt)pt\u00001nt\u00001Nt\u00001: (2) 2.2 Humanitarian Aid We assume that each period foreign donors with altruistic motives provide human- itarian aid to the economy in the form of pure transfers of real resources.6These transfers come in two forms: monetary aid per adult individual, Aa, and in kind aid per child,Af.7Monetary aid is measured in units of e\u00a4ective labor income, a necessary assumption to sustain an equilibrium of on-going growth.8Therefore Aa=a t+1wt+1; a2(0;1); (3) 5For tractability, the number of children is assumed to be continuous. Integer restrictions are thus neglected. 6Humanitarian considerations do play a role for the allocation of aid by foreign donors as evi- dent in Ball and Johnson (1996) and Svensson (2000). The determination of humanitarian aid by donors, exogenous to the recipient, is also consistent with the operation of aid provision within the OECD\u0092 s Creditor Reporting System (CRS) and Donor Assistance Committee (DAC), which report commitments and distributions of aid of donors by purpose. 7In kind per child aid could also be monetized, as the majority of U.S. Title II PL 480 food aid is for Kenya and Uganda (Kraak et al. (1999)). As long as part of this assistance is used for the subsistence needs of children, even in the presence of aid fungibility, the implications of our model are not distorted. In a later section, following Azarnert (2008), we also examine the explicit addition of monetary per child aid, Ac. 8We could instead assume as in Chatterjee et al. (2003) that monetary aid is measured in units of domestic output, that is, tied to the scale of the economy. As it will become clear later on, however, in equilibrium it makes no di\u00a4erence which of the two assumptions is used. 6where t+1is individual labor productivity and wt+1the real wage rate. In kind aid, on the other hand, represents food and medical aid targeted to the most vulnerable of the population groups, children, given that a stated goal of food aid is \u0091 to combat malnutrition, especially in children\u0092(PL 480, as quoted in Ball and Johnson 1996, p. 517). Kraak et al. (1999) in a study of the role of food aid in countries with an AIDS epidemic have found that food aid directly bene ts the poor through supplementary feeding programs while it improves the quality of diet of people living with HIV/AIDS. At the same time, it allows the availability and access of more nutritious food to children.9In addition, a study by De Waal et al. (2006) examining the e\u00a4ects of the 2002-2003 drought in Ethiopia has unveiled that \u0091 household receipt of food aid had a small but signi cantly positive association with child survival\u0092 . This outcome also nds support by Hu\u00a4 and Jimenez (2003) who state that \u0091 emergency food aid has been shown to play a role in saving lives and limiting nutritional distress\u0092and by Plumber and Neumayer (2009) who nd international food aid to negatively a\u00a4ect famine mortality. At the same time, as reported in the Center for Global Development Brief (2007), medical aid in the form of vaccines and increased awareness has almost eliminated measles as a cause of childhood death in seven African countries in southern Africa, freed 18 million children from the risk of river blindness in 11 West African countries since 1974, and reduced infant deaths in Egypt due to diarhea by 82% between 1982 and 1989. The above clearly illustrate the role of in kind aid in increasing children\u0092 s likelihood of survival, especially in regions where food is scarce and health conditions in a freefall. Thereby, and in line with the above evidence, we assume that the probability of survival from childhood to adulthood is enhanced by in kind aid, pt(Af)withp0 t(Af)>0.10 2.3 Households As already noted, at the beginning of their adult life in t+1, each individual bears nt+1 children. Raising a child involves two types of costs. First, parents spend \"t+12(0;1) units of time on each of them to take care of their health (breast feeding, taking children to medical facilities for vaccines, etc.). Each adult allocates \"t+1nt+1units of time to that activity. Second, raising children involves costs in terms of marketed goods. These costs relate to feeding children, taking them to medical facilities, buying medicines, etc. Speci cally, each individual spends a fraction \u00122(0;1)of his adult income on each child\u0092 s health. Thus, although access to \u0093out of home\u0094health services per se is free, families face a cost in terms of foregone wage income and consumption. 9Such food is necessary, especially for children that su\u00a4er from HIV/AIDS as they need to take their antiretroviral medication on a full stomach. 10Alternatively, it could be assumed that the probability of survival exhibits threshold e\u00a4ects with regard to children health status. This would imply that as health status improves above a threshold, the probability of survival increases. Such a consideration, however, would unnecessarily complicate the analysis and lead to multiple equilibria, an issue beyond the main point of this paper. For a formal illustration see Ag\u00e9nor (2009). 7Letyt+1denote the individual\u0092 s income in t+ 1; the total cost of raising nt+1 children\u0097 should all of them survive\u0097 is thus given by the sum of the opportunity cost in terms of foregone wage earnings and the opportunity cost in terms of foregone consumption, that is, (\"t+1+\u0012)nt+1yt+1. Thus, as is standard in the literature (see, for instance, Barro and Becker (1989), Galor and Weil (2000), and Azarnert (2008)), the existence of these costs creates a trade-o\u00a4 between the quality and quantity of children. This cost, however, is not with respect to education but with respect to health. Assuming that consumption of children in the rst period of life is subsumed in their parents\u0092consumption, lifetime utility at the beginning of period t+ 1of a (surviving) agent born at at date term 1\u0000pt+1(Af)nt+1\"t+1measures leisure in adulthood, whereas coe\u00a2 cients \u0011Land\u0011N measure the individual\u0092 s relative preference for leisure and surviving healthy children. The termpt+1(Af)nt+1hC t+1is equal to actual family size pt+1(Af)nt+1\u0097 which di\u00a4ers from fertility (the number of children per individual), nt+1, because the child survival rate is less than unity\u0097 multiplied by the health status of a child, hC t. In the standard literature, parents derive utility from the \u0093raw\u0094production of o\u00a4spring. Here, however, it is the expected number of healthy children that matters. Suppose that child mortality occurs only at the beginning of the period, so parents incur no rearing costs for children who die before adulthood.11Because there is no consumption in childhood, the period-speci c budget constraint is ct t+1= [1\u0000\u0012pt+1(Af)nt+1] t+1wt+1+Aa: (5) Note that although \u0012itself is not a decision variable, it could be made a function of either (or both) in kind or monetary aid. Both types of aid receipts would normally lead parents to spend a smaller fraction of their labor income on children\u0092 s rearing, so that\u0012=\u0012(Af;Aa), with\u00120 Af<0and\u00120 Aa<0. This would o\u00a4er yet another channel through which humanitarian aid may a\u00a4ect fertility and growth. However, as it will be shown later, this consideration will not in\u0087 uence our ndings. For simplicity, therefore, \u0012will be kept constant throughout. 2.4 Firms We assume a simple technology where aggregate output is given by Yt=BtNt; (6) 11Alternatively, it could be assumed that rearing costs are incurred for all children, regardless of whether they survive or not. The assumption in the text is more natural, given that in many poor countries mortality in childhood tends to occur early in the life of children. 8whereBtdenotes average, economy-wide labor productivity (which is the same for all rms) and Ntthe number of adult workers employed. Thus, production exhibits constant returns to scale in e\u00a4ective labor BtNt, which in the steady state gives rise to endogenous growth. 2.5 Health Status and Productivity In line with the evidence of Cutler et al. (2006), the health status of children and adults are not determined by the same factors. The health status of a child, hC t, depends on the income spent on goods for each child, in kind aid, the parent\u0092 s health status, hA t, and the time allocated by their parent to rearing them: hC t=\u0012(Af)(hA a child\u0092 s health status is linear in the share of resources spent by the parent, \u0012;and in the amount of in kind aid consumed, Af, because both help to improve his health and nutrition, thereby reducing their vulnerability to disease (see for instance Pelletier et al. (2003), Caul eld et al. (2004) and the references in section 2.2). Second, a child\u0092 s health depends on the parent\u0092 s health. This may be related to the impact of parents\u0092mental distress and anxiety on children\u0092 s life satisfaction (see Larson and Gillman (1999) and Downey et al. (1999)) and their physical ability to take care of their children (which may require walking long distances, on di\u00a2 cult terrain, to take them to medical facilities). It could also re\u0087 ect Barker\u0092 s (1998) \u0093fetal origins hypothesis\u0094which suggests that conditions in utero have long lasting e\u00a4ects on an individual\u0092 s health. Almond (2006) nds that cohorts in utero during the in\u0087 uenza epidemic of 1918, which a\u00a4ected a third of women of child-bearing age, were more likely to be too disabled to work compared to cohorts immediately before or after the epidemic. The a\u00a4ected cohorts were also experiencing lower educational attainment and lower wages.12Third, the health status of a child depends on the time allocated to him by his parent.13 The health status of adults depends (linearly) on their health status in childhood. This is in line with growing evidence suggesting that late life health is the outcome of a cumulative process of exposure to health risks in childhood, especially infectious diseases in the rst years of life. By determining health outcomes later in life, health in childhood may therefore play a critical role in the determination of socioeconomic status in adulthood (Strauss and Thomas (1998)). Fogel (1994) has shown that better nutrition in childhood, in the rst half of the twentieth century, a\u00a4ected the health and life-span during the adult years of life. Similarly, using data from the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics in the United States covering 30 years, Smith (2008) found that 12Note that the impact of the in utero linkage would be to include hA t\u00001instead of hA tin equation (7). If so, however, one would need to assume that adult health in t+ 1generates direct utility. 13Health status at birth, which could be accounted for by adding a linear term \u0016hC>0in (7), is ignored for tractability. 9poor childhood health has a quantitatively large e\u00a4ect on individual earnings and labor supply, as well as family income and household wealth.14Given this evidence, we specify: hA t+1=hC t; (8) Substituting (7) in (8) yields hA t+1=\u0012(Af)(hA t)(\"t)\u0017: (9) Thus, because a parent\u0092 s health a\u00a4ects his children\u0092 s health, or equivalently because adult well being depends on own health in childhood, there is serial dependence in hA t. In the spirit of Grossman\u0092 s (1972) approach, health is therefore viewed as a durable stock\u0097 which can be increased here not only by spending more on goods but also by allocating more time to taking care of one\u0092 s brood.15 As in Ag\u00e9nor (2009), adult productivity is taken to be linear in health status: t=hA t: (10) 2.6 Long-Run Equilibrium In this simple model, the market-clearing condition for the goods market is Yt=Ct=Nt[ct t+\u0012pt(Af)nt twt]; (11) representing total consumption spending at t. The following de nition may therefore be proposed: De nition 1. A competitive equilibrium for this economy is a sequence of prices fwtg1 t=0, allocations fct t+1;\"t+1g1 t=0, and and adults fhC t;hA tg1 t=0 such that individuals maximize utility, rms maximize pro ts, and markets clear . In equilibrium, individual productivity must also be equal to the economy-wide av- erage productivity, so that t=Bt.16In addition, to keep things as simple as possible, we assume that children of all generations face an identical probability of survival to adulthood being constant at pt(Af) =pt+1(Af) =p(Af):With this assumption, the following de nition characterizes the balanced growth path: De nition 2. A balanced growth equilibrium is a competitive equilibrium in which ct t,ct t+1,hC t,hA t,andYt=Nt, all grow at the constant endogenous rate 1 + . 14Health in childhood may also a\u00a4ect health and income in adulthood through education. For a discussion, see Ag\u00e9nor (2009). 15See Becker (2007) for a recent overview of Grossman\u0092 s approach and the subsequent literature. The analysis could be extended to account for the possibility that the stock of health depreciates with age. 16This in turn implies, that, given the rm\u0092 s pro t maximization condition wt= 1, in equilibrium it makes no di\u00a4erence whether monetary aid per adult is tied to total output per capita ( Bt) or e\u00a4ective labor income ( t). 102.7 Fertility, Time Allocation, and Growth Each adult maximizes (4) subject to (3), (5), (7), and (8), with respect to ct t+1,\"t+1, andnt+1, takingaandp(Af)as given, but also taking into account the impact of their decisions regarding \"t+1on the health status of their children and of their own.

Thus, the fraction of income spent on caring for each child cannot be too large. From the solutions (12) and (13), the following proposition can be established: Proposition 1. An increase in humanitarian aid has an ambiguous e\u00a4ect on fertility rate and reduces the time parents allocate to surviving children. In particular, in kind aid reduces fertility and has no impact on parent\u0092 s child rearing time, while monetary aid increases fertility and reduces parent\u0092 s child rearing time. In kind aid has a negative e\u00a4ect on fertility by increasing the probability of survival from childhood to adulthood. The fact that the fertility rate is inversely related to the survival probability is consistent with the result established by Ag\u00e9nor (2009), where an increase in the survival probability reduces the precautionary demand for children. This nding is also consistent with Kalemli-Ozcan (2003) in a stochastic setting that accounts explicitly for educational choices and ex ante uncertainty about the number of surviving children.18Monetary per-adult aid, on the other hand, increases fertility by reducing the \u0093quantity cost\u0094of children, thereby shifting resources from quality of children to quantity of children. Therefore, and in line with Azarnert (2008), per adult aid increases the return on child quantity. 17It is easily shown that p(Af)~n~\"= \u0003 <1, which implies that the time allocation is feasible and that leisure is positive in equilibrium. 18Note that, as in Ag\u00e9nor (2009), there exists a proportional relationship between children\u0092 s survival probability and the number of births. Even though this result contrasts the empirical evidence, which supports a less-than-proportional relationship (as in fact our empirical analysis con rms below), there are ways to break the linearity in our model. One way, would be to assume that the children who die prematurely generate a cost for their parents. Another, is to assume either that the probability of survival exhibits threshold e\u00a4ects with respect to total parental spending on rearing each child (Azarnert (2006)), or with regard to children health status (see footnote 10). Although such consid- erations would improve the quantitative size of the e\u00a4ects, the qualitative implications of our model would not change. For this reason, we prefer the analytical tractability. 11The e\u00a4ect of humanitarian aid on parent\u0092 s child rearing time, is captured only through the negative e\u00a4ect of per adult aid. This is consistent with the results of Azarnert (2008), although in his model aid does not reduce child rearing time but decreases the investment of parents to their children education, and the subsequent accumulation of human capital. The implication, however, is fundamentally the same. In kind aid is found not to have an e\u00a4ect on the time allocated to child rearing because, as in Ag\u00e9nor (2009), the increase in the survival probability is exactly o\u00a4set by the reduction in the number of children. In addition, ~\"does not depend on p(Af)because it is the actual number of children that matters for the allocation of time. This is a consequence of the log-linear utility function chosen here. As will be shown later, the inclusion of per child monetary aid will give rise to a relationship between survival probability and parent\u0092 s child rearing time.19 We next derive the balanced growth rate of the economy in Appendix A. The balanced growth rate of output per worker is 1 + =\u0012(1+\u0017)(Af)\u001a \u0003[1 +\u0011N(1\u0000\u0017)] \u0011N(1\u0000\u0017)(1 +a)\u001b\u0017 : (14) Equation (A15) implies that the model has no transitional dynamics. Following a shock, the time adults allocate to child rearing must jump immediately to its new equilibrium value. It then follows from (14) that the economy is always on its balanced growth path. From (A13) it is also clear that the health status of both adults and children,hA tandhC t, grow at the same constant rate. Equation (14) can be used to examine the impact of humanitarian aid on long-run growth. In particular, the following result holds: Proposition 2. An increase in humanitarian aid has an ambiguous e\u00a4ect on the growth rate of output per worker. In particular, in kind aid increases while monetary aid reduces the rate of per worker output growth. The reason why an increase in humanitarian aid has an unclear e\u00a4ect on the growth rate has to do with the opposing e\u00a4ects of in kind and per adult aid. In kind aid has a positive impact on growth by directly enhancing the health status of surviving children and their productivity during adulthood. Aid per adult, on the other hand, reduces the child-rearing time adults allocate to their children, which lowers children health status. This, in turn, reduces health status in adulthood, and subsequently the rate of economic growth. The positive growth e\u00a4ect of in kind aid is in line with the evidence provided by Bezuneh et al. (2003) who nd a sustained 1 percent increase in food aid to promote per capita income growth by about 2 US dollars in Tunisia. The e\u00a4ect of per adult aid, on the other hand, nds support in Azarnert (2008), which, as described before, reduces human capital accumulation and growth. 19It is worth mentioning that even if \u0012is considered to be a negative function of humanitarian aid, to re\u0087 ect the substitution in the fraction of parental expenditures on children\u0092 s health, the ambiguity of aid\u0092 s impact on ~nand~\"is futher reinforced. 12In the next subsection, we explore the sensitivity of our ndings to the consideration of an additional type of aid along the lines of Azarnert (2008): per child monetary aid. 2.8 Sensitivity Test Assume now that on top of aid per adult individual, Aa, and in kind aid per child, Af, each household receives an amount of aid proportional to the number of children, Ac.20 Therefore total monetary aid is represented by Aa+Acnt+1, which as indicated earlier is measured in units of labor income. This means that in accordance to equation (3), monetary aid per child is Ac=c t+1wt+1; c2(0;1): (15) This consideration, and following the steps outlined in Appendix A, yields the following solutions for fertility, child rearing time, and per capita growth +a)\u001b\u0017 : (18) The following assumption must be imposed to ensure positive values for these vari- ables: Assumption 2 :p(Af)>c=\u0012 . This implies that the fraction of income received as monetary per child assistance be small compared to health spending on caring for each child. In line with Azarnert (2008), equations (16)-(18) show that monetary per child aid cincreases fertility, decreases parent\u0092 s investment on the health of their o\u00a4spring by reducing child rearing time, and decreases output growth. At the same time, however, these equations demonstrate the validity of our main ndings as to the ambiguity of the impact of total humanitarian aid. Now also note that total aid has an ambiguous e\u00a4ect on adult\u0092 s child rearing time as well. The introduction of monetary aid proportional to the number of born children induces parents to increase their child rearing time as their expected (monetary) gain for every born child that survives rises.21 The analytical results, therefore, leave open the question as to the e\u00a4ects of hu- manitarian aid on fertility and growth. It is possible that one of the opposing e\u00a4ects 20Note that this type of aid is not given for every surviving child but for each born child to enhance their probability of survival. 21If instead, monetary aid cwas given for every surviving child, then the results would be similar to our benchmark ndings except for the need of the assumption c < \u0012 . 13dominates the other so that aid has a non-zero (fertility and/or growth) e\u00a4ect. But it is equally plausible that the two e\u00a4ects exactly o\u00a4set each other so that humanitarian aid does not have any impact at all. These are the issues that we try to shed some light on in the next section with the empirical evaluation of these e\u00a4ects. 3 Evidence Our aim is to examine the e\u00a4ects of humanitarian aid transfers on the rates of fertility and economic growth. Although an investigation of the growth e\u00a4ects of aid is by no means novel, there has only been limited work on the e\u00a4ects of humanitarian aid.22 Furthermore, there has not been to our knowledge a systematic examination of the impact of humanitarian aid on fertility nor a joint consideration of its e\u00a4ects on both fertility and growth. In this section we o\u00a4er an empirical investigation that combines these two issues. 3.1 Estimation Strategy and Data The examination of the e\u00a4ects of humanitarian aid, rst requires the classi cation of aid \u0087 ows into humanitarian and non-humanitarian transfers.23This classi cation follows Clemens et al. (2004), who disaggregate aid \u0087 ows into three types \u0096 short-impact aid, long-impact aid, and humanitarian aid, and Neanidis and Varvarigos (2009), who divide aid into productive and humanitarian (pure) transfers. Given our focus on humanitarian aid, these two studies o\u00a4er a natural benchmark for the construction of this type of \u0087 ows. We will, however, also consider di\u00a4erent proxies of humanitarian aid transfers below. Using the OECD\u0092 s Creditor Reporting System (CRS), which reports aid commit- ments by purpose, Table B1 in Appendix B describes the classi cation of aid \u0087 ows into the categories under consideration. Naturally, humanitarian aid \u0087 ows represent developmental and emergency food aid, and distress and reconstruction relief. An im- portant issue is that all these categories of aid have elements of both in kind transfers and cash payments. Given that the data do not distinguish between in kind and cash transfers, we cannot control separately for their e\u00a4ects as represented by AfandAa in the theoretical model. The idea is, as they are by de nition merged in the data, to examine whether they jointly have a non-zero e\u00a4ect on fertility or growth. If so, then this would be an indication that the e\u00a4ect of one type of aid (in kind or cash) dominates the other as described in our theory model. 22For the most in\u0087 uential studies in the literature see the introductory section. 23Although we cannot think of a type of aid not being humanitarian in nature, for the purpose of distinguishing humanitarian aid from the rest of aid transfers, we label remaining aid as \u0093non- humanitarian\u0094 . In the literature it is most commonly referred to as \u0093productive\u0094aid. See Clemens et al. (2004) for a detailed discussion on the latter category of aid. 14Table B2 presents the methodology that has been followed in order to obtain prox- ies for the two types of aid \u0087 ows. This requires the use of the OECD\u0092 s Development Assistance Committee (DAC) database, which includes data on total ODA (O\u00a2 cial De- velopment Assistance) gross disbursements. As made clear in Clemens et al. (2004), the reason we construct our humanitarian and non-humanitarian aid proxies by us- ing the CRS disaggregated aid commitments instead of the DAC disaggregated aid disbursements is the lack of data of the latter database prior to 1990. As such, our measures imply that the fraction of disbursements in the two aid categories in a given period is equal to the fraction of commitments in each category in that period.24 Consistent with our theoretical analysis which unveils the e\u00a4ects of humanitarian aid on both fertility and growth, we employ an empirical speci cation that corresponds to these considerations. For this reason, we estimate two equations corresponding to the fertility equation (12) and the growth equation (14), respectively. These two represent the reduced form equations of our model and are estimated independently of each other. However, we also consider their structural relationship as this is identi ed by equations (12) and (A15) and estimate them jointly as a system of equations where the rate of fertility appears as a determinant in the growth equation. Given the above, our benchmark fertility and growth regression model for equation (19) is as follows: nitdenotes the rate of fertility in countryiat timet,AidH itrepresents gross disbursements of humanitarian aid (% of GDP),Aidr itis gross repayments on aid (% of GDP), and fXl;itgm l=1represents a set of variables that are considered to be in\u0087 uential on fertility.25These are the level of economic development, as measured by the country\u0092 s initial per capita GDP (in logs), the infant mortality rate, the level of education, and the level of urbanization.26 In addition, we control for dummies that capture regional di\u00a4erences with the set fDj;itgn j=1(East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa). Finally, all regressions account for 24Despite the popularity this technique has gained in the literature (Clemens et al. (2004), Neanidis and Varvarigos (2009)), we should make clear at the outset that our ndings should be treated with caution as this method only o\u00a4ers an estimate of sector level aid disbursements that may entail errors the size of which we cannot assess. 25As shown in Table B2, the identity that determines gross repayments on aid is AidGross it =AidNet it+ Aidr it. The decision to use in our speci cation gross aid disbursements and gross aid repayments instead of net aid disbursements, is based on the consideration that aid repayments possibly have a di\u00a4erent association with fertility and growth than aid disbursements. That is, we prefer to test for it rather than impose it. We do examine, however, the robustness of our ndings with the use of net aid disbursements as well. 26See Angeles (2010) for a detailed discussion on the choice of these variables. 15common deterministic trends by incorporating dummies for the di\u00a4erent time periods, \u0017t, and control for unobserved country-speci c e\u00a4ects with country dummies, \u0016i, while \"itis the error term. In equation (20) except for gitwhich denotes the growth rate of per capita real GDP and fZk;itgq k=1which represents a vector of variables that have been identi ed in previous growth studies to explain a substantial variation in the data, the rest of the variables are common to equation (19). The explanatory set fZk;itgq k=1includes the logarithm of initial per capita GDP, an indicator of institutional quality from the International Country Risk Guide, indicators of scal (budget balance), monetary (in\u0087 ation), and trade (Sachs-Warner openness) policies, M2-to-GDP as a proxy for the development of the nancial system, the fraction of land in the tropics indicating the idiosyncrasy of these locations, and dummies that control for the occurence of civil wars. The fertility rate is also included in the set when we simultaneously estimate equations (19) and (20).27 The coe\u00a2 cient estimates of 1and\u00151will illustrate whether humanitarian aid has a signi cant e\u00a4ect on fertility and growth, and if so, the sign of the e\u00a4ect. Of course, it is possible that either or even both of these estimates do not statistically impact upon the dependent variables. In this case, we will take the nding as evidence of the o\u00a4seting e\u00a4ects of humanitarian aid as these have been illustrated in the theory section. We use ve alternative econometric procedures to estimate equations (19) and (20). The rst two are standard panel regressions, with the rst controlling for time dummies and the second for both time and country-speci c e\u00a4ects. The latter technique is superior to the inclusion of regional dummies as it allows every country in the sample to be treated di\u00a4erently. At the same time, however, it should be noted that it is not free of problems given that it may exacerbate a measurement error by removing a signi cant portion of the variation in the explanatory variables. The other three estimation procedures are based on techniques that address poten- tial endogeneity of the right-hand-side variables. Of these, the rst two are dynamic GMM estimations that control for the endogeneity of all the regressors, and the third is a joint estimation of equations (19) and (20) in a system that considers only the endogeneity of the fertility rate in the growth equation (3SLS). The two dynamic pro- cedures are the di\u00a4erence-GMM estimator developed by Arellano and Bond (1991) and the system-GMM estimator of Blundell and Bond (1998). The endogenous variables in the di\u00a4erence-GMM estimator are instrumented with lags of their levels, while system- GMM employs a richer set of endogenous instruments, treating the model as a system of equations in rst-di\u00a4erences and in levels. In the latter, the endogenous variables in the rst-di\u00a4erence equation are instrumented with lags of their levels as in di\u00a4erence- GMM, whilst the endogenous variables in the level equations are instrumented with lags of their rst di\u00a4erences. Although these techniques have been popularized in 27All these variables are commonly used as controls of growth in the aid-growth literature. Their de nition and sources can be found in Table B2. 16the aid-growth literature by Dalgaard et al. (2004) and Roodman (2004), they do have their limitations. Di\u00a4erence-GMM is susceptible to a weak-instruments problem because lagged levels may not be highly correlated with their rst-di\u00a4erences, while system-GMM requires the instruments of the level equation to be orthogonal to the country-speci c e\u00a4ects. Given their limitations, we choose to utilize both even though system-GMM has been found to produce less biased estimates than its di\u00a4erence coun- terpart (Hayakawa (2007)). Another di\u00a2 culty associated with the two dynamic GMM estimators relates to the choice of the number of lags of the endogenous variables used as instruments. This is an important issue raised by Roodman (2004, 2009) who shows a number of ndings to be fragile to that choice. To enhance the robustness of our results, we estimate our model with various sets of lags. We initially use an unrestricted number of lags, starting at a lag length of two, and thereafter reduce the length of the maximum lags to four and three. This allows us to restrict the number of instruments to be smaller than the number of countries in the regression.28For additional robustness, we do this either by directly reducing the number of lags or by collapsing the instrument set to create one instrument for each variable and lag distance (see Angeles and Neanidis (2009)). Both the GMM approaches we use are checked for the validity of the instruments by applying two speci cation tests. The rst test is the Hansen (1982) J-test of over- identifying restrictions which we use to examine the exogeneity of the instruments. This test is consistent in the presence of both heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation of any pattern.29To avoid dynamic panel bias we instrument for regressors that are not strictly exogenous. These include all the right-hand-side variables in equations (19) and (20) except for the three location dummy variables. The second test is the Arellano and Bond (1991) test for serial correlation, the existence of which can cause a bias to both the estimated coe\u00a2 cients and standard errors. Given that rst-di\u00a4erencing induces rst-order serial correlation in the transformed errors, the appropriate check relates only to the absence of second-order serial correlation. To deal with any remaining serial correlation, we use clustered standard errors at the country level where appropriate. Turning on to the data, we use a panel of 66 countries (a list of which is given in Appendix B) for the period 1973-2007, where the beginning of the period is restricted by the availability of the OECD reports on aid commitments (CRS). We follow the standard approach of constructing 4-year period averages (1973-75, 1976-79, 1980- 1983,..., 2004-2007) so as to minimise business cycle e\u00a4ects. This implies a maximum sample size of 594 observations, though we end up working with an unbalanced panel of 316 and 268 observations for equations (19) and (20) respectively because of missing data. The data on aid come from the OECD\u0092 s DAC and CRS databases, while most of the rest of the data are from the World Bank\u0092 s World Development Indicators. Details 28As pointed out by Roodman (2004), an excessive number of instruments can result in over tting of the instrumented variables, thereby biasing the results towards those of the OLS. 29Failure of the null hypothesis suggests that the set of instruments is incomplete implying omitted variables bias. 17on the description and the sources of the variables can be found in Appendix B, Table B2. Table 1presents some summary statistics of the data from where it is interesting to note that humanitarian aid represents slightly more than 10 percent of total aid \u0087 ows.30 3.2 Main Findings We begin our investigation by estimating equations (19) and (20) independently of each other with the two versions of xed-e\u00a4ects and the two dynamic GMM procedures. Then, we allow for a simultaneous estimation of both equations with 3SLS using the sets of control variables described above. Recall that according to the theoretical mechanisms of the preceding section, the e\u00a4ect of humanitarian aid on fertility and growth could go in any direction. Our benchmark ndings are presented in Table 2. Starting with the fertility equation, the xed time-e\u00a4ects regression in column (1) shows that fertility is positively in\u0087 uenced by infant mortality and location in Sub- Saharan Africa and negatively by education. At the same time, the level of a country\u0092 s development, the degree of urbanization, and being situated in East Asia do not seem to matter. These ndings are in line with Angeles (2010) and the contributions of the uni ed growth literature with regard to the process of demographic transitions, which stresses the importance of mortality rates (Kalemli-Ozcan (2003) and Azarnert (2006)) and education (Becker (1960), Barro and Becker (1989), Galor and Weil (2000)). Turn- ing to the variable of our immediate concern, humanitarian aid appears not to have a signi cant e\u00a4ect on fertility. This is consistent with our theoretical illustration as far as the two opposing e\u00a4ects of in kind and monetary aid (either per adult or per born child) on fertility cancel out. This nding, however, contrasts Azarnert (2008) who proposes a positive e\u00a4ect. Moving to the growth regression, the variables included in sets ZkandDjare supportive of the general ndings in the literature. Speci cally, having a higher in- stitutional quality indicator, a more open oriented trade policy, and being situated in East Asia are conducive to faster economic growth. A higher in\u0087 ation rate and being located in the tropics and in Sub-Saharan Africa, on the other hand, are associated with slower growth. In addition, there is no evidence of the importance of the nancial sector, of scal discipline, of a recent internal con\u0087 ict, and of conditional convergence. Finally, humanitarian aid appears to exert a positive e\u00a4ect on growth, albeit only sig- ni cant at the 10 percent level. This result provides mild support to the dominance of 30Even though the average size of humanitarian aid in our sample represents 0.439 percent of the recipient country\u0092 s GDP, this gure has not remained stable over each of the four decades that span our coverage period (1973-1980, 1981-1989, 1990-1998, 1999-2007). Humanitarian aid has been above average in the rst decade (0.596), then dropped for the following two decades (0.439 and 0.257 respectively), and then picked up in the last decade (0.480). The most generous providers of humanitarian aid among the donors, in absolute amounts transfered, include the United States (0.36), the European Commission (0.21), the United Kingdom (0.06), the Netherlands (0.04), and Japan (0.04) \u0096 the share of each country\u0092 s humanitarian aid transfers in total humanitarian aid \u0087 ows in parentheses. 18in kind aid on the health status of surviving children compared to per adult aid that reduces the child-rearing time adults allocate to their children. This, in turn, translates into higher productivity during adulthood and higher growth. In column (2), the inclusion of country xed-e\u00a4ects in addition to the time-e\u00a4ects, changes a few of the ndings. Now the only signi cant contributor to higher fertility are higher rates of mortality. Similarly, in the growth regression we observe the signi cance of conditional convergence e\u00a4ects and of scal discipline e\u00a4ects in addition to the e\u00a4ects of in\u0087 ation. All remaining regressors are now statistically insigni cant, including humanitarian aid in both of the equations. One possible drawback of the results presented thus far is that they may be biased by the endogeneity of some of the regressors. To overcome such a problem, the following three columns present results that control for reverse causality. Columns (3) and (4) depict the dynamic GMM regressions while column (5) the 3SLS regression with the instrumented variables appearing in bold type. In all of them, a consistent nding is the positive impact of mortality on fertility and the zero e\u00a4ect of humanitarian aid on economic growth. Moreover, the two GMM regressions indicate a negative e\u00a4ect of humanitarian aid on fertility signi cant at the 10 percent level, while the 3SLS estimation also unveils a diminishing e\u00a4ect of fertility on growth at the same level of signi cance. The rest of the explanatory variables in both regressions are less robust as they become statistically insigni cant as we move between the three estimations. The speci cation tests in Table 2 as expressed by Hansen\u0092 s (1982) J-statistic, which examines the validity of the instruments in columns (3) and (4), cannot reject the hypothesis that the instruments are uncorrelated with the error term at a normal con dence level.31Additionally, the Arellano-Bond (1991) test rejects the hypothesis of no second-order serial correlation in the error term in both regressions (4) at least at the 5 percent level. The nal point to note from our benchmark ndings in Table 2 is that our variable of interest seems to have a statistically zero e\u00a4ect on both fertility and growth highlighting the o\u00a4seting e\u00a4ects of humanitarian aid described in the theory section. If there is any indication of a non-zero e\u00a4ect, this appears to be mildly negative with regard to fertility, implying that humanitarian aid may work toward reducing population growth. The aim of the following section is to investigate the robustness of our ndings in a more detailed manner. 3.3 Robustness of Main Findings A few recent studies in the aid-growth literature (see Easterly (2003), Roodman (2004, 2009)) have demonstrated that most of the empirical results are sensitive and suggest the examination of their broader applicability. In this regard, we investigate in this section the robustness of our ndings by re-running the regressions under various mod- 31Note that in these estimations we have used all the available lagged values as instruments starting from the second lag and reduced the number of instruments with the \u0093collapse\u0094command in Stata. 19i cations. These include alternative proxies for humanitarian aid, di\u00a4erent measures of fertility, di\u00a4erent instrument lag structures in the two dynamic GMM procedures, changes in regression speci cations, and the modelling of non-linear aid-interaction ef- fects. As will be shown, our basic ndings survive all of these tests pointing to the zero e\u00a4ect of humanitarian aid. 3.3.1 Alternative Humanitarian Aid Proxy As explained before, in line with the literature, our measure of humanitarian aid in- cludes developmental food aid, emergency food aid, other emergency and distress relief, and reconstruction relief. This proxy may not be the best, however, since it ignores aid o\u00a4ered for medical or health reasons and aid o\u00a4ered to support the agricultural sector. In our theoretical model, health aid along with food aid have been in\u0087 uential to the probability of children survival to adulthood, whereas agriculture-related aid can be expected to augment food security and accessibility to food. At the same time, this de- nition includes reconstruction relief aid which may not be directly related to fertility as it is mainly used to support short-term construction work after an emergency. We take up this issue and o\u00a4er alternative proxies for humanitarian aid that account for the above considerations. First, we augment the original measure of humanitarian aid with health aid and then with both health and agriculture aid to consider a broader de nition of aid. Then, we treat the original proxy of humanitarian aid separately from health and agriculture aid as we add each of them in the same regression to test for potentially di\u00a4erent e\u00a4ects. Finally, we exclude the category of reconstruction relief from the original proxy of humanitarian aid and then control separately for health and agriculture-related aid transfers. Note that, as in the case of the original measure of humanitarian aid, health and agriculture-related aid represent a mix of both in kind and cash transfers. As such, it is not clear from the outset in which way these aid categories will in\u0087 uence fertility and growth. Table 3 presents the estimates of these speci cations.32Columns (1) and (2) aug- ment humanitarian aid with health aid and both health and agriculture aid, respec- tively. The results of both columns point to a zero e\u00a4ect of humanitarian aid on both fertility and growth, o\u00a4ering support to our main ndings. The outcomes do not change when we include separately in the regression humanitarian aid, health aid, and agriculture aid as columns (3) and (4) indicate. In a similar way, columns (5) and (6) show that our ndings survive the exclusion of reconstruction relief from the measure of humanitarian aid and the simultaneous inclusion of health and agriculture aid trans- fers as regressors. Given these, we conclude that our ndings are not conditional on the proxy for humanitarian aid. 32Even though regression results are based on the xed e\u00a4ects technique that controls for both country and time e\u00a4ects, the estimated coe\u00a2 cient of humanitarian aid is qualitatively the same when we use the rest of the techniques outlined in Table 2. 203.3.2 Alternative Fertility Measure In all preceding analysis we have used total fertility rate as our preferred measure of fertility. There are, however, a few alternative measures related to fertility used in the literature. These are the net fertility rate which is adjusted by the rate of mortality, the crude birth rate, the population growth rate, and the total fertility rate from a di\u00a4erent source (United Nations) compared to the original variable (World Bank).33 To re\u0087 ect on the choice of the fertility variable, and as a basis of comparison, we repeat our benchmark regression analysis by using each of the above variables instead. The results of these regressions are shown in Table 4. The use of the alternative fertility measures does not change our conclusions in any meaningful way as humanitarian aid continues to have a statistically insigni cant impact on both fertility and growth. As before, we nd the fertility-related variable to decrease growth in a statistically signi cant degree. 3.3.3 Alternative Instrument Lag Structure Our dynamic GMM estimations have so far been based on the maximum number of lagged values used as instruments for the potentially endogenous explanatory variables. At the same time, we have used the \u0093collapse\u0094option in order to keep the number of instruments to a low level. We now take a di\u00a4erent avenue and limit the number of instruments in an alternative way. As before, we start from the second lag and while originally allow for all possible lags of the endogenous variables as instruments, we then limit the maximum number of lags to four, and then to three. In this way, we can address the concerns raised by Roodman (2004, 2009) as to lag structure considerations. The rst three sets of columns in Table 5 refer to the di\u00a4erence-GMM estimations, while the following three sets present the system-GMM results. The e\u00a4ects of humani- tarian aid are in line with our earlier ndings. The only exception is that the negative e\u00a4ect of aid on fertility now appears to be robust only in the di\u00a4erence-GMM regression and signi cantly so at the 5 percent level for two of the regressions. We also observe that the speci cation tests con rm the validity of the instruments and the absence of second-order serial correlation at the 5 percent level. Therefore, we can conclude from this exercise that the choice of the instrument lag structure has no signi cant bearing on the coe\u00a2 cient estimates of humanitarian aid.34 33To ensure an appropriate speci cation in the regression of the crude birth rate, we include the crude death rate as a determinant. Also, we calculate the net fertility rate by adjusting for the infant mortality rate (which we then exclude from the regression), while the result is also robust to the consideration of the under-5 child mortality rate. 34The estimated coe\u00a2 cient of humanitarian aid is qualitatively the same even when we use the \u0093collapse\u0094option to further reduce the number of instruments. 213.3.4 Alternative Speci cations and Aid Interaction E\u00a4ects Although the variables included in vectors XlandZkidentify regressors that have been found relevant in the fertility and growth literatures, the sets are by no means exhaustive. To this extent, we examine the sensitivity of our ndings by either replac- ing some variables with alternative measures or by expanding the two vectors with a number of additional control variables. The former include the use of trade openness measured by the size of trade (as fraction of GDP) in the growth regression instead of the Sachs-Warner trade policy indicator, and the replacement of infant mortality rates with life expectancy at birth in the fertility equation (Angeles (2010)). The extra con- trol variables in the growth equation include life expectancy (Clemens et al. (2004)), black market premium and initial secondary school enrolment (Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995)), while new variables common to both regressions include a dummy that prox- ies for the period immediately following a civil con\u0087 ict (Collier and Hoe\u00ad er (2002)) and non-humanitarian (productive) aid (Clemens et al. (2004), Minoiu and Reddy (2009), Neanidis and Varvarigos (2009)). The results, presented in Table 6, are based on the joint estimation of the two equations with 3SLS. The estimated coe\u00a2 cient on humanitarian aid, however, remains unchanged when we use the rest of the techniques outlined in Table 2. As can be seen, the replacement or inclusion of other variables in our model speci- cations do not alter our conclusions in any way. The coe\u00a2 cient on humanitarian aid is still found to be insigni cant with regard to both growth and fertility. The addi- tional controls have the expected sign, with life expectancy having a negative e\u00a4ect on fertility and the black market premium a negative e\u00a4ect on growth. Furthermore, the time period following a civil war leads to higher fertility (signi cant at the 10 per- cent level) re\u0087 ecting the compensation process of parents to the loss of children during the war. This mechanism, known as the \u0093replacement e\u00a4ect\u0094 , has been traditionally explained by the demographic literature (see, for instance, Palloni and Rafalimanana (1999)). Finally, non-humanitarian aid is found to positively impact upon both fer- tility and growth. The latter of the e\u00a4ects complements the ndings of Clemens et al. (2004), Minoiu and Reddy (2009), and Neanidis and Varvarigos (2009), while the former indicates the willingness of parents to have more children in the presence of aid \u0087 ows directed to the support of the educational, social and capital infrastructure, and development needs of the general population. Although our theoretical model does not make any provision for the e\u00a4ects of this type of aid, the empirical ndings imply an additional human \u0096 and a new physical \u0096 capital accumulation channel through which \u0093productive\u0094aid although increases the quantity of children also o\u00a4ers a quality extension of their livelihood. Another set of checks we undertake is motivated by the observations that the impact of aid on growth exhibits diminishing returns or that it appears to be context-speci c. For example, Hansen and Tarp (2001) and Clemens et al. (2004) nd aid squared to have a negative e\u00a4ect on growth, while there is also evidence to suggest that the positive growth e\u00a4ect is limited in countries with a good macroeconomic policy envi- 22ronment (Burnside and Dollar (2000)), in countries outside the tropical climate zone (Daalgard et al. (2004)), and in time periods following a con\u0087 ict but not immediately after (Collier and Hoe\u00ad er (2002)). At the same time, Azarnert (2008) supports that humanitarian aid in sub-Saharan Africa has a positive e\u00a4ect on fertility and a negative e\u00a4ect on growth as these countries have not yet experienced the demographic transi- tion. Although most of the growth-related ndings have been overturned by Angeles and Neanidis (2009) in the case of total aid \u0087 ows, we wish to test the validity of our results when such considerations are taken into account with regard to humanitarian aid. Our ndings are summarised in Table 7. Column (1) modi es our regression speci - cations to allow for the squared e\u00a4ects of humanitarian aid, non-humanitarian aid, and aid repayments. As before, humanitarian aid has a zero e\u00a4ect while non-humanitarian aid has a positive e\u00a4ect in both equations, without any indication of diminishing re- turns. In columns (2), (3) and (4), the impact of humanitarian aid does not appear to be in\u0087 uenced by the policy environment, the consideration of climatic di\u00a4erences, and the timing of its distribution, respectively.35Humanitarian aid directed to sub- Saharan Africa and high-fertility pre-demographic transition countries, however, does have an impact on fertility and growth as shown in columns (5) and (6). In particular, humanitarian aid provided to sub-Saharan African nations even though it does not in\u0087 uence fertility, it reduces economic growth (and increases economic growth to the rest of the recipients). At the same time, high-fertility countries that receive this type of aid experience an increase in their fertility rates with no e\u00a4ect on economic growth. These ndings suggest that parents in sub-Saharan Africa respond to higher human- itarian aid by lowering the child-rearing time they allocate to their o\u00a4springs, which reduces their health status and productivity as adults. In addition, in high-fertility countries humanitarian aid reduces the cost of having children pointing to a di\u00a4erent fertility e\u00a4ect compared to countries that underwent the demographic transition, as documented by Azarnert (2008). Overall, therefore, we conclude that except for the pre-demographic transition countries our ndings are not in\u0087 uenced by non-linear and aid interaction e\u00a4ects. Finally, we further explore the validity of our ndings to the exclusion of outlier ob- servations, a di\u00a4erent measure of aid, and an alternative period averaging. Even though we do not report the results to save space, when we exclude the outliers identi ed by the Hadi (1992) procedure we observe that the results remain unchanged. Similarly, our ndings are in place when we use net aid disbursements \u0096as most of the studies in the related literature use \u0096instead of gross aid disbursements in the calculation of humanitarian aid transfers. Lastly, our results remain una\u00a4ected when we consider an alternative time period averaging of nine-year intervals that correspond to each decade (1973-1980, 1981-1989, 1999-2007) even though Easterly (2003) and Roodman (2004) 35The policy environment is proxied by the Sachs-Warner policy indicator. Results do not change even when we use an interaction term between humanitarian aid and a post-con\u0087 ict dummy variable that accounts for two periods after the elapse from war. 23have shown that di\u00a4erent periodizations can signi cantly alter the results of the most prominent empirical studies. The results of all these extra sensitivity tests are available upon request. 4 Concluding Remarks Our aim in this paper has been to study how humanitarian aid may impact on de- mographic transition and economic growth. It has been motivated by a recent article by Azarnert (2008) who supports that humanitarian aid may work against its goals of diminishing population growth and fostering economic development. Our theoretical results, however, indicate that the e\u00a4ects of humanitarian aid are not that straight- forward as they unveil signi cant ambiguity. The empirical investigation illustrates that aid does not have a signi cant impact on fertility and growth (except for the pre-demographic transition countries), providing support to the two con\u0087 icting e\u00a4ects of humanitarian aid outlined in our theory model. The theoretical model presents a two-period OLG economy where reproductive agents live (at most) for two periods: childhood and adulthood. Agents face a non- zero probability of death in childhood, which is decreasing in the amount of food aid consumed. On top of this non-monetary type of aid, each adult individual receives a permanent \u0087 ow of monetary aid which along with the labour income is used to nance individual consumption and spending on each child\u0092 s health. In addition to working, adults allocate their time to leisure and child rearing activities of surviving children. Following the literature, the health status of a child depends on the income spent on goods for each child, the amount of in kind aid, the parent\u0092 s health status, and the time allocated by their parent to rearing them, while the health status of adults exhibits \u0093state dependence\u0094in the sense that it depends linearly on their health status in childhood. Therefore, although fertility choices are endogenous, the model abstracts from human capital accumulation so that life expectancy is directly related to health status rather than human capital arising from educational choices. The foregoing discussion suggests that, when assessing the impact of humanitarian aid on health outcomes and growth, it is important to account both for the direct e\u00a4ects (in kind aid) and for the indirect e\u00a4ects that may operate through time allocation (monetary aid). If indeed aid allows for a more e\u00a2 cient use of time, understanding what households do with these time savings becomes critical to health and growth. This is because individuals may consider not only allocating more \u0093raw time\u0094to market work as an alternative, but also increasing time spent in home production and caring for children\u0092 s health. This latter activity would a\u00a4ect health status in adulthood, and therefore productivity, wages, and growth. The e\u00a4ect of humanitarian aid on both the rates of fertility and growth of per worker output is found to be ambiguous. On the one hand, in kind aid, by increasing the probability of survival from childhood to adulthood, has a negative e\u00a4ect on fertility, while on the other, monetary per-adult aid increases fertility by reducing the \u0093quantity 24cost\u0094of children. In a similar way, in kind aid, by directly enhancing the health status of surviving children, has a positive e\u00a4ect on growth while at the same time monetary aid reduces the child-rearing time of adults. This in turn, lowers the health status of both children and adults, and subsequently the rate of economic growth. Given the ambiguity of the theoretical analysis as to the e\u00a4ects of humanitarian aid, we resort to an empirical investigation. The empirical evidence is obtained by applying standard regression techniques to trace the impact of humanitarian aid on fertility and growth. The empirical method- ology considers both reduced form estimations and joint estimations of the system of the two equations. Our results suggest that humanitarian aid has on average a zero impact on both the rate of fertility and the rate of output growth, implying that the two con\u0087 icting e\u00a4ects of humanitarian aid outlined by our theoretical illustration fully o\u00a4set each other. The sole exception applies to countries characterized by high fertility rates where humanitarian aid is shown to raise fertility. Our results are robust to a wide range of sensitivity tests and e\u00a4orts to control for simultaneity bias. A natural extension of the theoretical analysis would be to model the e\u00a4ects of non- humanitarian or productive aid. As the empirical section suggests, the positive e\u00a4ects of this type of aid on fertility and growth contrast the e\u00a4ects of humanitarian aid. The positive impact on fertility could be an outcome of improvements in living conditions as these emerge from the investment of aid on health, education, and infrastructure services provided by the government. This could induce parents to spent a smaller fraction of their income on their children\u0092 s health as now the government contributes to this expense. This, in turn, would lead parents to optimally choose a higher number of children. This increase in fertility, however, will not cause a decline in growth. On the contrary, the improved quality of provided public services would directly a\u00a4ect the population health status, which, if marginally signi cant, would increase productivity and growth. 25References Ag\u00e9nor, P-R. 2006. \u0093Public Capital, Health Persistence, and Poverty Traps,\u0094Working Pa- per No. 115, Centre for Growth and Business Cycle Research, University of Manchester.

The reason is that in the model adult health is not valued per se , but only to the extent that it bene ts children. Also note that from (A11) and (A12), it can be shown that p(Af)~n~\"<1, given that \u0003<1:Thus, leisure is positive in equilibrium. In addition, a necessary condition for (A3) can be derived from (A10), 1\u0000\u0012p(Af)~n > 0, as long as monetary aid is not too large: a< 1=\u0011N(1\u0000\u0017): Equations d(Af)= 0,d~\" da<0. Thus, an increase in in kind aid per child lowers the fertility rate ~n, while it has no e\u00a4ect on total time allocated to child rearing ~\". Monetary per adult aid, on the other hand, increases fertility and reduces child rearing time. The production function equation (6) implies that aggregate output per worker in t+ 1is Yt+1 Nt+1=Bt+1; (A13) or equivalently, using in equilibrium t+1=Bt+1, Yt+1 Nt+1=hA t+1=\u0012(Af)(hA t)(\"t)\u0017: Finally, using the balanced-growth rate of output per worker is 1 + =\u0012(Af)(~\")\u0017=\u0012(Af)(\u00031 p(Af)~n)\u0017; (A15) (A16) (A15) implies that the model has no transitional dynamics; following a shock, the time adults allocate to child rearing must jump immediately to its new equilibrium value. It then follows from (A16) that the economy is always on its balanced growth path. From (A13) it is also clear that the health status of both adults and children,hA tandhC t, grow at the same constant rate. Equation (A16) has the following implications d(1 + ) d(Af)>0,d(1 + ) da<0: Thus, an increase in in kind per child aid increases the growth rate of per worker output, while monetary per adult aid has exactly the opposite e\u00a4ect. 32 33Appendix B Country and Data Appendix Country Sample (66) Argentina, Belarus, Belize, Bhutan, Bolivia , Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Chile, Colombia, Congo Dem.

World Bank, WDI Humanitarian and non- humanitarian aid \"Humanitarian\" aid is the product across all donors, for each recipient, of \"Total ODA (OA) Gross Disbursements\" from the online DAC database, Table 2a, with the elements of the CRS field \"usd_amount\" classified as \"H\" in Table A1, divided by the sum of all aid in CRS field \"Total ODA (OA) Commitments\", multiplied by 100. \"Non-humanitarian\" aid is calculated in a similar way, according to the \"N\" classification in Table B1 (% of GDP in current USD from WDI). OECD, DAC (online) and CRS (online) based on Clemens et al. (2004) and Neanidis and Varvarigos (2009) Aid repayments \"Total ODA (OA) Gross\" minus \"Total ODA (OA) Net\" (% of GDP in current USD). OECD, DAC (online) and WDI Initial p.c. GDP GDP per capita in constant 2000 USD for the first year of the period. World Bank, WDI Institutional quality ICRGE indicator: av erage of corruption, bureaucratic quality and rule of law indicators that takes values between 0 and 10. Roodman (2004) and Political Risk Group Inflation Natural logarithm of 1+consumer price inflation rate. World Bank, WDI Trade policy (Sachs-Warner) Dummy variable that meas ures the degree of openness. Wacziarg and Welch (2003) and Roodman (2004) M2/GDP Money and quasi money (% of GDP in current USD). World Bank, WDI Budget balance Overall budget balance, including grants (% of GDP in current USD). World Bank, WDI Tropical Dummy indicating tropical location. World Bank, Global Development Network Civil war Dummy that takes the value of 1 during a period of civil war. Collier, Hoeffler, and Sambanis (2006) East Asia Dummy indicating region. World Bank Sub-Saharan Africa Dummy indicating region. World Bank Fertility rate Fertility rate (births per woman), total. World Bank, WDI Infant mortality Mortality rate, infant (per 1,000 live births). World Bank, WDI Initial school Gross ratio of total enrollment, regardless of age, to the population of the secondary school age group, for the first year of the period. World Bank, WDI Urban Urban population (% of total) . World Bank, WDI Sensitivity Set Crude birth rate Birth rate, crude (per 1,000 people). World Bank, WDI Crude death rate Death rate, crude (per 1,000 people). World Bank, WDI Net fertility rate As the total fertility rate is expressed in births per woman while the mortality rate is expressed in terms of 1,000 live births, an adjustment needs to be made to the rate of mortality in order to be expressed in terms of live births per woman: net fertility rate = total fertility rate - (total fertility rate)*(mortality rate)/1000. World Bank, WDI based on own calculations. Population growth rate Population growth (annual %). World Bank, WDI Total fertility rate Fertility rate (births per woman). United Nations, Population Division Trade Sum of exports and imports (% of GDP in current USD). World Bank, WDI Initial life expectancy Life expectancy at birth, total. World Bank, WDI Black market premium [(Parallel exchange rate/official exchange rate)-1]*100. World Bank, Global Development Network Post-conflict1 (Post-conflict2) Dummy that takes the value of 1 one (two) period(s) after civil war has ended. Collier, Hoeffler, and Sambanis (2006) High-fertility countries Dummy that takes the value of 1 for countries with a rate of fertility above the sample average of 4.22.
