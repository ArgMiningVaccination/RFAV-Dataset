Natural health is the philosophy and practice of using natural, non-invasive techniques to promote total well-being. These techniques support the body and an individual's multifaceted needs. The most common methods used in the natural health field are nutrition, herbology, iridology, aromatherapy, flower essences, homeopathy, and supplementation. Natural health does not seek to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, disorder, or syndrome. These actions and terminology are reserved for medical professionals like physicians, nurses, and dietitians. Although these healthcare fields can work together, natural health should only be practiced in non-emergency situations and always within its scope of practice. For more information, read our blog [Natural Health and Conventional Medicine: Working Together](https://www.trinityschool.org/blog/index.php?pid=34&p=&cat_id=6). At Trinity, we offer many diverse programs. Our core programs focus on natural health principles and techniques to support holistic wellness. These include Health Coach, Certified Natural Health Professional, Certified Holistic Health Practitioner, and Certified Traditional Naturopath. CNHP is the prerequisite for the CHHP program, and CHHP is the prerequisite for the CTN program. Placement exam opportunities are available for those with healthcare experience. Call 800-428-0408 for details. Our specialized programs accentuate our core offerings and provide extensive education about supportive techniques for your practice or personal use. These include Aromatherapy Specialist, Biblical Coach, Endocannabinoid Professional, Flower Essence Specialist, Holistic Fitness Specialist, Lyme Specialist, Master Herbalist, Master Iridologist, Mind-Body Integration Specialist, Nutritional Consultant, and ZYTO Specialist. While there are many excellent health coaching programs available, few emphasize the modalities and techniques used in natural health practice. Instead, these programs often focus solely on general diet, exercise, and mental or emotional support. Trinity's Health Coach program provides a broad spectrum of natural health knowledge and skills to use in your practice, including anatomy and physiology, foundations of health, muscle testing, Bach flowers, iridology, and pH testing. Our programs give you actionable tools and techniques to promote holistic wellness. With over one-third of adults using complementary or alternative care, the natural health field is continually expanding, and practitioners are needed to meet the demand. Natural health education provides the knowledge and skills to support clients on their journey to wellness. Certification demonstrates proficiency to prospective clients or employers, so you can start your own practice or work with others in a group setting. Advanced natural health certifications, like the Certified Holistic Health Practitioner or Certified Traditional Naturopath programs, provide you with more extensive knowledge, tools, experience, and credibility. By earning an advanced certification, you can stand out from the crowd and attract attention from potential clients. These high-level programs also allow you to obtain board certification or international registration. While many students seek natural health education to learn to help themselves or their families, others decide to put their knowledge into practice and work directly with clients. Careers in the natural health field include, but are not limited to, owning a natural health practice, performing virtual consultations with clients, working in a group practice as a supportive counterpart or health and wellness coach, overseeing a supplement, herbal, or health food retail store, becoming an educational speaker, teaching in group settings, writing a book or educational materials, or starting a blog about your natural health experience.
