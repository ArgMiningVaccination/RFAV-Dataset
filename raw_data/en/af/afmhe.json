His methods have successfully reversed Alzheimer's in numerous patients. In his book called The End of Alzheimer's, Dr. Bredesen states that everybody over the age of 45 should have a \"Cognoscopy\". What's a \"Cognoscopy\"? For starters, a cognoscopy is in no way uncomfortable like a colonoscopy, but it could save a brain. It is a deep look into the many factors that are known to lead to brain degeneration. Dr. Bredesen has identified 6 main factors to consider. Using comprehensive blood tests, assessments and questionnaires, along with few non-invasive in-office tests, we are able to determine which of the 6 factors may be affecting a person and to what extent. At this point, more Functional Medicine tests may be ordered to determine the causes. What happens after a \"Cognoscopy\"? Whether you currently have symptoms of cognitive decline or not, when we find any of the factors that cause neuro-degeneration we will recommend a treatment plan. Treatment most often includes diet, supplements and lifestyle changes. Your program will be tailored to achieve maximum and lasting results for you personally. How Long will it Take to get Improvements? Some people will experience improvements within a month, others it may be longer. Even if you do not currently have symptoms, you should notice improvements in energy, productivity and moods What Is Your Training? Dr. Maria is a Doctor of Chiropractic.
