There is, however, another part of th^ equadon that hasn't re\u00ad ceived as much attention. I am reficTring to thc physician assistants, nurse pracrinoners, nurses, etc. who have strugg^ day after day, year after year\u2014 under virtually wairime conditions \u2014 to give dignity, health and strength to their paoents. Rochester is lucky to have a wide vanety of extraordinarily dedicated, caring professionab wlio are giving diemselves to a field with a tremendously high bumout rate which most health care professionals wouldn't touch under any conditions. However, diis field was dimin\u00ad ished on June 30 when Mary Angerame saw her last patient at Community Health Netwoik. Mary, a Nurse Pracriuoner, iias been with Community Health Network since soon after it was estab\u00ad lished in the late 1980s ro idenofy and treat AIDS patients in our community'. It is almost impossible to describe die intensity of thc relationship between an AIDS patient and the medical pracritioner^ That joumey\u2014through diagnosis, emodonal upheaval, numerous seri\u00ad ous and debilitating illnesses and, until recently, a slow but inevitable approach toward death \u2014 is on a level rarely experienced by patients with terminal Illnesses without the AIDS sterna at\u00ad tached. Mary Angerame has been fighting in the front lines since the day she first walked duou^ the doors of Community Health Netwofk. Wes di\u00ad rectness, kindness, compassion and sinceritywcrc immediately apparent to her collc!^;ucs and pa\u00ad tients, as was her encydopedic kno\\fc'ledge of AIDS illnesses and their treatment Since that time, her commitment, dedicanon and sense of humor have become iegcndary, as have the sto ries of her running out in thc middle of the night to be with patients in distress. Most ofall, she has shown countless frightened patients of all ages and classes the path to living with acceptance, hope and trust in their own inner resources, regardless of the final outcome of thdr disease; indeed, she has stood tiezt co many of them as dtey hsve dmwnihetr last breadi. As a petson tiving with AIDS, I hsve found that Maty has become deeply embedded in my heart as a parmer in the scrug^ with daikness scarchir^ for the light. She has cotisistendy given me strength, courage and a belief in thc future \u2014 whether that be one day, one week or 20 years \u2014 as well as thc best medical care avaik^^le anywhere. Many of us have been inspiied by her eocsmple to leam how to use this dreadful illness to become wiser and better human beings. Her warmth and love will be carried forth by thc many patients whose lives she touched snd charged. As a certifiable introvert, I can think of only a few people on this planet whom I would want to be with me at thc closing moments of my life. Mary is definitely one of them; what greater tnbute could be paid to any human being than to want that person with you at rhe extraordinary moment of transition?

Jeff will be succeeded at ARI by Bill Pritchard. The two stopped by the Etrtpty Chset office last month to share some feelings about ARI and the ongoing work to serve people living with HIV/AIDS, which v^ill now include training for HIV positive peopie returning to the work\u00ad place, due to the beneficial effects of protease inhibitors. jeff said that he and Michael (also a longtime, dedicated volunteer for HIV causes) decided on the D.C. move because \"WeVe been talking about living in D.C. for a few years. It's one of the few cities that weVe happened across in our travels that we both felt we could live and work in.\" The couple plan to settie in Alexandria, Va. Jeff said. \"Michael is transferring with the company he works with, so for him it*s a smooth transition. Tve started a job search but have not yet secured a position.** Friends \"roasted\" Jeff on July 23 at Harry's Bar and Grill. Jeff started at ARI in February 1990. He had be*n active in H\u00bbV/AiDS causes for some time before that, however. In 1986 he served as a founding board member fbr Helping People with AIDS. Inc.. and in 1989 chaired the annual HPA fundraiser Dining for Dollars. He also was on the host committee which brought the NAMES Project AIDS Quik to Rochestcr for the first time in 1989, In addition, hc has b<ten active on the Gay Alliance Board, and as a ftost fbr the Empire State Pride Agenda's Ni^t of 100 Parties fundraisers; Jeff and Mkhael hosted tite first ESPA party here in 1992. \"In 1990 1 decided it was time for a job change,\" Jeff sakl, \"and it was a time of admin\u00ad istrative transition at ARI. I was hired as volunteer coordinator and five months later the director of development, Jerry Algoxer. was leavktg, and I was asked to step into his place.'* JefF said that his job has involved several different roles, such as development, fundraising, communtty relations and political advocacy. When asked v4tat ntajor changes he has seen at ARI ki the last seven years, he responded, \"Growth.

Jeff has also seet% changes in the numbers of people served by thc agency, and in \"the fcices ofthe people we serve. When I started in 1990 most of our clients were gay men, individuals in need of supporc Now we see many more families with children being affected. We see many more people be\u00ad coming HIV positive because of longtime substance abuse \" Even though the rate of deaths among gay men has been sharpiy reduced, too many youn^r rr%en are stii* taking risks t^^a^ can lead to infection. Jeff noted. \"We have to remember that with every generation come new challenges. The messages we were giving in 1990 were very different from the messages we ffve now. In *90 it was 'wear a condom;' in *97 it's more taking responsibil\u00ad ity for one's behavior and making positive changes in that behavior, whether in sexuai practices or alcohol and drug use.\" Jeff sees an ongoing connection with AIDS work in his future, either professk>nally or as a volunteer. He said, \"I think I will probably always be active for tv\u00bb\u00ab> reasons: one, I've tost so many friends to HIV over the years, so that it's near to my heart, and second, I have met so many wonderful people kt this field that 111 always suy connected.\" Bill Pritchard takes over for Jeff at ARI as of Aug. 4.

U5. Judge Eugene Nickerson struck down the taw because he says it imposes special rules for gay and iesbian military personnel, violates their right to free speech and ille\u00ad gitimately discriminates against them by catering to the prejudices of heterosexuals. The ruling will probably be appealed and may go to the Supreme Court for a final decision. The Clinton administration has consistently defended the policy as a satis- fectory \"compromise\" between his cam\u00ad paign promise to end the military ban on gays, and the anti-gay Congressional effbrt to retain a complete ban. The judge stated, \"For thc United States govemment to require those self-identify\u00ad ing as homosexuals to hide their orienta\u00ad tion and to pretend to be heterosexuals is to ask them to accept a judgement that their orientation is in itself disgraceful and they are unfit to serve.\" He cited the long history of oppression suffered by gays, firom the Middle Ages to the Nazi Holocaust to the polke harassment ofthe Stonewall Inn, to show that sexual orientation is a \"suspect classification\" which requires the highest level of scrutiny for discrimination. Nickerson said that the \"don*t ask don't tell\" policy violates Constitutional guarantees of free speech and equal protection. He re\u00ad jected both the \"speech\" and \"conduct\" as\u00ad pects ofthe law. Nickerson had ruled in March 1995 that the speech regulation restricted gay service members' speech unconstitutionally. Hov^rever. thc Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the vaKdity of the entire policy rested In the conduct section, and ordered that Nickerson re-examine the law on those grounds. The conduct specification mandates that gay and lesbian service members remain celi\u00ad bate and refrain fi-om any affectionate behav\u00ad ior off or on base, even in private. There are no such rules for heterosexuals. The speech segment of the rule prohibits gay service members from saying anything that might reveal a homosexual orientation. For thek* part, commanders are barred from asking personnel about their sexual orientation un\u00ad less they have \"credible information\" that homosexual activity has occured. Nonetheless, under this law gay and lesbian military personnel have continued to experi\u00adence '*witch hunts,\" and co be discharged lor engaging in homosexual acts. The Servkemembers Legal Defense Network says that the Oktton policy has in feet resulted In a drantatk 43 percent kKreasc In discharges of gay men and lesbians (after a year under the new polky whkh went Into effect in 1994) and an 18 percent increase in discharges in the last two years. Judge Nkkerson has now ruled that both conduct and speech portions of tfte law vio\u00ad late the Constitution's equal protection guar\u00ad antee. Nickerson has written. \"It is hard to imagine why the tr\\^r^ holding of hands off base and in private is dangerous to thc mission of the Armed Forces if done by homosexuals but not if done by a heterosexual.\" Further, Nickerson stat'^d that, through its argument that the law is needed to maintain military readiness, the government has made \"an outright confession that *unit cohesion* is a euphemism for catering to the prejudices of the heterosexuals*\" He said that the taw sub\u00ad jects only gay and lesbian troops to a separate, discriminatory set of regulations, thus violat\u00ad ing equal treatment under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. **A court should ask itself what it might be like to be a homosexual,\" Nickerson wrote in his ruling. **.,. The plaintiffs are American citizens... This country includes people of many different kinds and beliefs. But as Chief Justice Marshall said in a different context, *we are one people.* Americans are one people both in war and peace. It is not within our constitutional tradition for our govemment to designate members of one societal groupas pariahs.\" \"We are now one step closer to having this archaic taw overturned once and for all.\" sajd Matt Coles, director of the ACLU's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project. \"This case is aboutthe most basic American value: equal treatment. one set of rules for everybody.

The Nebraska, Delaware and Louisiana tegisiaturcs all recendy passed hate crime measures whkh would increase penalties for those found guilty of committing crimes against people due to their actual or per- ceWed sexual orientation. Democratk Gov. Ben Nelson of Ne* braska signed his state's bill into law on June 12. The legislation was adopted by a vote of 35 to 9 on June 5. In Delaware, Democratic Gov. Thomas R Carper signed thc Delaware hate crimes bHI on July 12 at Rehoboth Beach, whkh has a large gay and lesbian population. The law passed the state House by a vote of 38 to 0 and the state Senate by a vote of 16 to 3 on June 25. Louisiana's Republican Gov. M.J. \"Mike** Foster has not yet decided whether to sign the Louisiana hate crimes bill. It has been on his desk since June 23, and he had 20 days to take action on the bill before it automatically bc-^ came law. It was passed by the state Senate on May 21 by 32 to 13, and passed in thc state House on June 17 by a vote of 62 to 36, after heated debate, during which an attempt was made to remove sexual orientation from the list of protected categories. That attempt lost by a vote of 49 to 46. If all three bills become law, 20 states plus thc District of Columbia will have enhanced penalty hate crimes legislation. -M.

Accordmg to GLAAD, some media stories have discussed the importance of gay and lesbian anti-violence projects around the country alerting their communities, or have identified Versace's parmer by name. Others refer to Cunanan as a \"bloodthirsty gay serial killer,\" or a \"high dass gay prostitute,\" and speculate about Versace's sexual habits, im\u00ad plying that he put himself in harm's way. GLAAD has issued a guide for media pro\u00ad fessionals entitied \"The Dos and Don'ts of Reporting 'Murder by Design,'\" which has been distributed to over 5,000 media out\u00ad lets. GLAAD also has issued a media roundup of sonte of the coverage of the Versace case, mentionutg both the worst (such as the New York Post and \"Hard Copy\") and best cover\u00ad age (i.e. The New York Titties and the Miatni Herald). GLAAD Associate Communications Director Liz Tracy says, \"Many ofthe artides and reports GLAAD is seeing around the Cunanan case are based on tired, archak stereotypes ofthe communtty, and only serve to further confuse the public about wtto gay and lesbian people are.- Of course these stories should refer to Cunanan's sexual orientation, but only so far as it serves to tell tite story, not to sensationalize it.\" For more information, or a copy of the \"Dos and Don'ts,\" call Liz Traceyat (212)807- 1700, or via pager at (800)946-4646.

And Sa^ level of smugness (The Worid's Image Centre?), die city knows it's no Seatde. It was fitting, therefore, diat Price and Murdoch were diis year's grand marshals of Rochester's gay pride parade. And a fitting job the>' did \u2014 smiling and waving from a shiny silver convertible that blared **We Are Famil>'.\" It was real waving, too, not the Queen Mum's handcut^>ed, bardy-mov- ingldnd. Tliat's because Price and Murdoch appreciate both the visceral and symbolic aspects of waving. \"It's very playful,\" said Price, who noted thatshe and Murdoch live in a suburb of Washington, D.C, a very unplayfiil place. Waving in a parade, though not a guest spot on \"Oprah,\" also means you Ve amved- For Price and Murdoch, the honor of being grand marshals was personal, professional and political, and the three are as intertwined as the couple itself. Price and Murdoch, however, weren't always the doyennes of thc paiade scene. 'Tlie first parade I wentto was on Halloween in San Francisco when I was in college,\"- Price re\u00ad called. \"I was so closeted. I vcty much wanted to be around openly-gay pcopJe, but I was so afiraid of beingseen. \"The small steps are thc scariest,\" she added. That small step, however, was necessaiy fc\u00bb: Pnce to take befbre she could take the giant step of becofxung thc first openly gay columnist in the mainstream press. She made her debut in Tbe Detroit Nett^s'm 1S>92, and her syndicated cokimn is was one ofthe first psqjeis to run Price's column every week.) It's no wonder Price believes that modest, sclf- heaUng accomplishments are the way to create change. \"The only thing holding us back is our own fears,\" she said. Price, however, believes in handling the phobic with care. That's one reason she likes pride parades anddteirilk. 'They can be one way for closeted gays and lesbians to put a toe in the water,\" she said. And she loves holding out her hand\u2014waving and wimess\u00ad ing the tentadve replies. But, in appearance at least, pride parades aren't as \"scary\" as thcy used to be, Price admits. *The composition of parades has changed. It's no longer just dykes on bikes and guys in drag,\" she said. \"(The Rochester) parade induded a bowling league, and, a whole spectrum of people of faith: Baptists, Episcopalians, Presbyterians....\" Price said one reason for the new look is the fiict that thc American public has become more toler\u00ad ant ofgays and lesbians. Not just tolerant, down\u00ad right emuiarive. Wasn't this year's hot trend \"les\u00ad bian chic?\" It's no wonder that more gay and lesbian groups are feeling comfortable enough\u2014 so much so that they dress up as bon\u00bb4ing pins \u2014 to march in pride parades. Some wonder if all this mutual ease is a good thing.

It doesn't bodier them that pride parades have more \"mainstream\" elements or that they're often less polirical than in the past. Price questions thc traditional nouon of what's polirical, much as the women's movement did 30 years ago. She likewise beiicves that the polirical is personal \u2014 thc most polirical act being to accept yoursdf as a gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender person. Once you do, Price reasons, you can become visible and start to make things change. 'Rochester is the best example of this happen\u00ading,\" said Murdoch, pointing to gay employees' groups at Kodak and Xerox that he^^cd diange those corporarions' cultures and policies. Polices isnot synonymous with anger,Murdoch added. \"There's a time for shaking fists, and a time for embracing.\" One person who embraced Price and Murdoch, literaUy and figurariveiy, was Rochester Mayor Bill Johnson, who gave each woman a medal. Murdoch found this an excellent example of progress. \"Here's thc mayor ofa dty, hugging and kissing a lesbian couple, and thanking them for telling the worid that Rochester is gay-friendly.

But it has to be channeled p\u00bbosirively,\" she said. \"Get in thc marriage fight,\" Price exhorted, \"Send money to Hawaii, and you'll make an invest\u00ad ment in every gay person in this country. Once the barrier to gay maniage falls, all the other barriers will fall\" (Hie Hawaii Equal Rights Marriage-Project is a volunteer organizarion that informs die pubHc, media and legislature about die issues surrounding same-sex marriage.

Price also urged gays and lesbians to address the sdf-dcstrucrive behaviors that come out of fear and self-loathing. **We need to reach out to our OUTI community and deal with alcc^ol and drug abuse, unsafe ser , depression and suidde,\" she said. \"There's no quesrion that there are bad things happening out thetc. But Jesse Helms is not our biggest threat.

On Day 0 (orientation day), i arrived at the N.C State Fiirsrounds with my ex-iover David, and a mutual friend of ours, Lenora. We handed in our pledges (you had to raise $ 1,700 In pledges in order to be able to ride), regis\u00ad tered for our tents (we would be camping in tents every night), had our safety orientation (\"Stay Alert. Stay Alive\"), got our ID bracelets and pariced our bikes for the next day. Day I began at 4 a.m. in order to be at the Fairgrounds ready to leave by 6:30 a.m. Prior to the ride out, there was an opening cer\u00ad emony. A part of this is the Riderless Bicycle. Four people guide a riderless bike down through the center aisle to remind us ofall the lost souls who would not be participating on the Ride. It was a sobering reminder of why we were participating. For me, the floodgate of tears opened when I saw the bike. I kept picturing my dad being gone one day soon. I v/as also struck by the huge diversity of people who were volunteering: old and young; gay. straight and bi; African American, white. Latino/a and Asian; men, women and transgendered people; couples, groups and individuals. As we rode out* we were greeted by hun\u00ad dreds of peopie, including the media, wishing us well. It was a great start. However, I immediately had mechanical problems with the bicycle \u2014 not a good omen. It tumed out (after five of us spent 15 minutes looking at the brakes, the chain, etc.) that the problem was simply that the rear tire was not screwed in securely. Nevertheless, it was reassuring that almost eyery rider who passed by asked if we needed help. On Day I our route was 112 miles long \u2014 the longest route for any day in the history of any AIDS Ride ever. The first half of the joumey wet\\t fairiy smoothly; I was tired, but a surpnsing number o< v/eU-v/\u00bbh\u00abrs a,\\ong the v^ay. In one tov*n\u00bb Warrcnton, N.C. the whole Main Street was decorated with red ribbons and even the mayor had come out to greet the Riders. It was mspiring. Some children in the town had set up a makeshift refreshment stand for the AIDS Riders with free water, lemonade and Gatorade. The path was challenging to be sure. Unfor\u00ad tunately, after 83 miles my knees gave out. (I have a history of knee problems.) I had to be SAG*d (taken by a support-and-gear, SAG. van) to the night's camp ac Southside Virginia Community College. Sitting on the bus I neariy cried. I had trained and tried so hard, yet had not been able to finish the day's ride. Also, gtven my history of knee injury. I knew that I Rtig^ not finish any of the days* rides. When I consulted the doctor that night he recommended that I discontinue the remain\u00ad der of the ride, confirming my worst n^ht- mare. I couldn't \u2014 I had come too hr to abandon It so earty on. So he gave me Motrin and toM me the usual (use my knee braces, take drugs, ice my knees at each pit stop, watch my cyding style...). While 1 vt^satthe medical tent at camp that night. I saw people with IVs in their arms, getting pumped full of saline to fight their dehydration. I found out later that on the first day. 390 riders were SAG*d. Ten of those were hospicalized, two in critical condition. One ended up being IHe flighted to the hospi\u00ad tal. I fek pretty lucky and healthy lt\\ compari^ son. Later that night t met up with Lenora. and she ttrfd me that she had had some problems wfth dehydration as v^. On Day 2 w^ were up at S a.m. and on the road by 7 a>m. Afar onty the first fTrile both my knees felt like they were MKng apart. But the rolling hills and early dew in the air made me less ntindful ofthe pain. All along the path each day there were inspirational messages spray painted on the roadway for the Riders by the volunteer Sign Crew. Messages like \"We love you,\" \"Remember why you're here.\" \"2 miles to lunch.\" \"You*re our heroes,\" and the like encouraged even the most exhausted of Rid\u00ad ers. I made it to mile 35 before the pain made me quic The remaining 30 miles that day I had to be SAG'd to camp at Petersburg, Va. The day's high was about 95 degrees. I had to make a decision that rUght\u2014whether to continue or not. It was not an easy decision, given the long hours of training, mental preparation and pledge-requesting that I had done. I decided to \"crew\" (work on the crew which supported the Riders and the Ride) the next day instead of cycling, with the hope of resting my knees so that I could finish the Ride on Day 4. Duringthe final 20 miles ofthe Ride. David's gearshift gave out. leaving him with only three gears for the ever-changing terrain of the Ride. Lenora was starting to feel the Ride too. On the moming of Day 31 wished David and Lenora well. David's bike was still not fixed, so he had to ride the entire 88 miles with only three gears. I was paired with a fellow injured Rider, Darcy Schwartz, for crewing. We helped take down our camp, got bussed to our new campsite, helped lug people's bags (some people did not know the meaning of a 35- pound weight limit), helped set up tents, and for six hours solid greeted people at the finish line that day to tell ihem where to park their bikes and where to go from there. I also found out later that Lenora was starting to really get sick, but she wouldn't give in. She was just as determined as \\ was. Day 4 (the last day) \\ v^as determined tQ go as far as I could. Day 3. when I cheered on the cyclists as they finished, had left me feeling hollow. I had yet to taste that sweet flavor of completing a day's ride. I saw Darcy that moming. and we wished each other well. The day*s high was about 97 degrees. Dur\u00ad ing the Ride. Lenora was having real difficul\u00ad ties, so David stayed with her. to pace her and to encourage her. 1 told them that the only way I was going to make it was to go at my own pace, so we broke up and rode separately. I controlled my speed, watched myself go\u00ad ing up hills, iced my knee at each pit stop, got my pain killers In there too. and routinely participated in an activity highly common at the ph: stops. I jokingly call it \"^-easing the groin.\" You see. in order to avoid rashes in the groin area caused by the friction of legs brush\u00ad ing against the seat, you grease down the p-oin area with Vaseline. Of course, by Day 3, modesty had gone out the window, to the point where Riders were plainly sticking their fiends down their biking shorts and lubing their soft spots rii^t there at the pit stops. As one Rider expressed it, \"I am doing things with VasdIne that I once onty fantasized about.\" Day4 wasgoodto me. It was 85 miles.some of which had the worst hills of the Ride. Toward the end. we were going up this end\u00ad less hill. The residents of the neighboriiood were along the top of the hill shouting \"This is the last hitl> we promise!\" As 1 passed them by I laughingly shouted, \"Like we haven't heard that e^ Cen^^Uientkti 11 ,..\u00a5fhmn we could see the Washington Monument up ahead, I couldn't believe it; I thought^ this might be my day. Sure enough, I nriade it! I made it to ^e finish line and burst Into cheers when i did. i was elated! A few miles later, v^en we could see the Washington Monument up ahead, I couldn't believe it; I thought, this might be my day. Sure enough, / tnade id I made it to the finish line and burst into cheers when I did. I was elated! Lenora and Pavid finished about 20 minutes later. I ran Into Darcy at the holding area prior to the Victory Ride (the last part of the Ride where all of the cyclists ride in unison). She asked me If I had finished, and I elatedly said yes.\" When I asked her. she said \"no.'* that she had to quit at Pit Stop 4. It was a bitter\u00ad sweet moment for me. I did not want to be happy for myself when I couldn't be happy for her At 5:54 p.m. we lined up for the last two miles or so in D.C. in what was called the Victory Ride. The National Park Service closed off part of the Memoria! Bridge. Then the 1.44S cyclisu biked from the Pentagon park\u00ad ing lot onto the MaU area near the NA/ashington Monument, eight riders abreast, in k>ng-sleeved shirts of either red\u00ab orange, yellow, green, blue or purple. My two friends and I agreed, arriving to the welcome there for us, that we now knew how Olympic champions felt. I reminisced about che past four days duringthe Victory Ride. Ail along the four days' routes, there were townspeople carrying posters, displaying red ribbons, offering drinks, encouraging us up hills, holding out their hands to \"slap us five.\" honking their car homs, spraying us with garden hoses and just being helpful. All of the Riders helped each other with mechanical bike problems or with problems like dehydra\u00ad tion, low spirits or fatigue. I topk home many memories and images from the whole adventure, but I think that the scene which I'll remember most (besides the welcome in the Mall, of course) was of a certain man and woman along the roadside in Virginia on Day 4. As I was biking up a shaded hill I noticed this couple along the shoulder of the route. The woman was seated In a plastic molded lawn chair with her knees up to her chin. The man was standing behind the chair, with one hand on the woman's shoulder. The woman was folding up a sign with a large red ribbon along wtth some people's names (whkrh 1 assume were fHends of thtirs whom they had k>st to AIDS). Below the names were words of en\u00ad couragement to the Riders. The couple said not a word, expressing themselves only with a look which said \"thanks for doing this and good luck.\" It was a very solemn scene; it touched me profoundly somehow for its simplicity and raw feeling. During the whole ride the weather, com\u00ad bined with the Riders' not drinking enough, took a toll on them. On Days I and 2, many Riders were SAG'd. Days 3 and 4 were better, as people had adjusted their activities to re\u00ad flect the harsher conditions (dehydration, high temperatures and ^tigue). The mantra for the Ride was literally \"drink and pee\" (or. hydrate and urinate for the medical people there). At the end, there was a Closing Ceremony, thanking all the volunteers and stafF and in\u00ad forming us that the Ride has collected over $3.4 million for the Whitman Walker Clinic (a clinic administering to HIV-infected Individu\u00ad als) and Food and Friends (a meals-on-wheels program for HIV-infected individuals). Again at the Closing Ceremony there ap\u00ad peared the fUderless Bicycle, and again I cried. Both times that I had cried Lenora and David had embraced me, expressing their support for me without uttering a word. And then the Ride was over, and the real world was back. Overall, I biked abouc 60 percent ofthe 350 miles, i feel good about that. I've also decided that if I can't ride next year, that I will volun\u00ad teer for the crew. Because of che great experiences I had. I am going to volunteer fbr the Closing Ceremony for the Boston to New York City AIDS Ride this year. The Rkle takes place Sept 12-14, ending on Bth St in NYC. The Ride organizers still need volunteers in New York for the dosing ceremony There are several Riders coming from the Upstate New York area (Rochester, Olean and other cities), se It would be great to have a home-town cheering section for their flnish.

It's simple, e Cyberhair gives you a completely natural look and feel, e It's easier to care for than real hair. You can wear Cyberhair around the clock, seven days a week. You can even wear it for swimming, biking, or anything else. The bottom line? No one will be able to tell where your real hair ends and your Cyberhair begins... unless you tell them. Now you know why I wear this remarkable new hair alterna\u00ad tive myself. (Of course, I may not k)ok like the guy in my ad. but I REALLY feel good about my appearance.)

Cyberqueers Censorship onUnc The recent Si:^reme Court ixding on Internet irec speech is reassuring. The Communications Decency Act would have pushed all gay-related Internet material into \"a cyberspace doset,\" to quote Denny Lec, an openly gay spokesperson for thc ACLU. The Court has now established that First Amendment rights of free speech apply online. The vaguely worded \"dccencj^* act would have made it a crime to send \"Indecent\" or \"patendy offensive\" material that couid bc accessed by minors. Thc Court made it dear that adults' online discourse should not bc reduced to the level of elementary school children in order to \"protect\" minors. Disturbingly, however, prognuns that block access may still be used to censor gay and lesbian materials, whether sexual or not. The Cybersitter, made by Solid Oak Software, is meant to bc used to block children's access to pornographic materi\u00ad als online. However, according to the Natkmai NOJFTttteee, published by die Nadonal Organiza- tkm for Women, tts site has been blocked by Solid Oak because of content suppoctif^ fesbian and gay rights. Solid Oak states on ita website that it bkKks 'iiomoscxuaSiy/cransgeoder sites/' In addkion to fafloddng knows ,what else.\" Noc only is dus censorship, it is done without most users' knowki^. Aside fiom Cybersitter, diere are ocher similar di^ being installed in fiK:CDry, and customers who don't ask will never know that they are viewir^pre-censoced material.

St^teme don was Bowers was the Aoxxney of Georgia. He proudly de\u00ad fended Gcotgia's anti-homosexuality crimindbws before the Supreme Court, and pointed m his victory during every reelection camfKiign. Ten years later, Midiad Bower? is back in the news, still flaunting his homophobia. On May 30, 1997, at Bowers' request, thc Eleventh Circuit federd s^ipeals court embraced homophobia. ^SMarv.Bmerj, the Court uf^idd his 1991 dedsioa to rescind a job offer xo a new attomey, Robin Shahar, sokly because sfae had a religious commitment with Gtecsifieid, her kK^;time woman partner. Hofain Beovm, the Bowccs* in heard Bowers talk a k>t abour valuing peopk fbr the work they did, about hon\u00ad esty, and about mtcgrity. And since Robin's work was so good, and stnoe Bowers obviousl)' cared moce about her work tfaan her persond kfi:, Robin believed diat Bowers wouldn't care about her sexud orientation. Yeah, ti^u. In June 1991, after she accepted the job offer and befbre the time she was to begin, Robin told an aide to Bowers that she was getting mamed and that she would be chang^^ her last name to **Shahar.\" Shahar is Hebrew for '*sccKing God/' and as devout Jews, both Robin and Fran, Robin's partner, had decided to change their last names to **Shahar\" at their commitment ceremony. Though Robin told Bowers' aide about her in^xnding \"marriage,\" somethingin her prevented her fix>m telling \"marriage\" was with awoman. ers' staff soon knew Robin's dearly Five of Bower's top deputy attomeys generd hdd severd meetings in the next few days discuss the situation\" (Query: How many dqputy attorneys generd does it take...?) Two designated deputies thenwentmthdr boss and recommended that he resdnd the job oEScr he made to Robin. Bower agreed. He couldn't use thc excuse that Robin had lied on her job s^iplication because, as it turned out, she hadn't. Robin had specifically indicated that her tnaritd status was \"engaged,\" and had indicated that \"Frandnc M. Greoifidd\" was her \"future spouse's name.\" Answering a tfaat asked whether any rebtives worked fisr the Scate of Georgia, Robin wrote, \"Frandne Greenfield, fimire spouse.*\" Instead, cwo deputies summoned her haod-dekveted a fiom thAt sfae didn't mtend to use die job to make pc^ricai statcmenes, bur tfac deputies refused.

(In case you're wondering the same kw firm that had <^krcd Robin a job hdped with the case, akxigwith the American Gvil Liberties Union atid Titfnhda Legd Defense Fund). In addition, Robin asserted chat Bowecs had violated hec oon- stituciond ri^ to Fian are cecp^iized (the Shahars had their comntitmentceremony,as scheduled, in July 1991), In his sworn deposition, Midiad Bowers ac\u00ad knowledged that Shahar'smarriageceremonydidn't violate any laws.
