Cystic acne is a particularly painful form of acne to deal with, both emotionally and physically, because of its severity and duration. Taking the form of throbbing, blood-filled bumps that start deep below the skin's surface and usually do not come to a head, cystic acne can take weeks to subside and often leaves lasting scarring or hyperpigmentation. Cystic acne is certainly no fun to experience, and it can issue a major hit to our confidence, especially if we feel like we don't know how to resolve it. Furthermore, it can feel daunting to try out different topical treatments without knowing how their ingredients will interact with our skin. Ayurvedic remedies may offer a potent, accessible solution for those struggling with cystic acne. Rather than treating the symptoms of ailments, Ayurvedic medicine approaches the root cause. This approach not only treats acne as it arises, but also targets the underlying conditions that lead to acne in the first place. In the long run, natural Ayurvedic remedies can both boost your health and overall balance and help keep your skin looking youthful, radiant and acne-free. The Ayurvedic Perspective on Cystic Acne According to Ayurveda, cystic acne is caused by a Kapha imbalance. Kapha, which consists of water and earth, can induce excess sebum production when elevated, which can in turn lead to clogged pores. When these pores accumulate bacteria, we can develop an infection in the area that becomes trapped under layers of dead skin\u2014which is why cystic acne rarely comes to a head. An elevated sebum production can be caused by hormonal fluctuations. While when we think of acne, we typically think of teenagers and adolescents, hormonal changes during menstruation, pregnancy and menopause can all contribute to cystic acne. In addition, conditions like [PCOS](https://www.umaoils.com/blogs/uma-oils/what-is-pcos-and-how-can-ayurveda-help-treat-it?_pos=1&_sid=aa325a016&_ss=r) can cause cystic acne to regularly appear. One's diet also plays a role in one's skin; as [Dr. Zeel Gandhi notes](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/how-to-treat-cystic-acne), \"a diet rich in kapha foods like milk, curds, and oily foods can trigger cystic acne.\" The Ayurvedic approach to cystic acne focuses on anti-inflammatory, detoxifying lifestyle and beauty practices. Whether you experience regular breakouts or are dealing with a painful, pesky pimple for the first time, here are 5 all-natural cystic remedies to try out. Ayurvedic Remedies for Cystic Acne Eat a healthy, Kapha-pacifying diet As noted before, eating foods that increase Kapha, like milk, sugar, oily foods and processed foods, can induce inflammation in the skin. Try to avoid these foods and to instead eat a diet full of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, like berries, green vegetables, garlic and nuts. By doing so, you'll combat the imbalances at the root cause of acne while also boosting your overall health. What we eat is extremely personal, and there is no one diet that suits all, so it's important to also keep in mind seasonality and your own constitution. [During summer](https://www.umaoils.com/blogs/uma-oils/the-ayurvedic-summer-diet?_pos=1&_sid=9338f6b26&_ss=r), for example, try to eat sweet, bitter and astringent foods that are also Pitta-pacifying. Also take into consideration [your own doshic constitution](https://www.umaoils.com/blogs/uma-oils/how-to-eat-for-your-dosha-for-optimal-health-mood-weight-more?_pos=7&_sid=96dbf3bc1&_ss=r), curating a diet that reduces Kapha foods and caters to your specific needs.

Many of these herbs can be sprinkled into dishes for a kick of flavor, consumed as tea or taken in the form of supplements. - [Turmeric](https://www.umaoils.com/blogs/uma-oils/anti-aging-essentials-how-turmeric-extract-can-make-your-skin-glow?_pos=2&_sid=dc0b876b4&_ss=r): Thanks to the extremely powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin, turmeric's main active ingredient, turmeric is revered in Ayurveda as an anti-aging and acne-fighting salve.

It can thus combat some of the hormonal fluctuations and excess sebum production that cause cystic acne in the first place. Apply soothing, anti-inflammatory essential oils Since excess oiliness leads to acne and inflammation, applying more moisture in the form essential oils might seem contradictory. However, the reality is that our skin often produces excess oil as a result of a dry, weakened skin barrier. When we over-exfoliate or fail to adequately hydrate the skin, it overcompensates by producing more oil, thus making breakouts more likely. We need to keep the skin hydrated to nourish and protect it. As dermatologist Dendy Engelman tells [Byrdie](https://www.byrdie.com/cystic-acne-4782793#:~:text=Treatments%20For%20Cystic%20Acne,-Gentle%20cleanser%3A%20Oftentimes&text=%E2%80%9CWe%20don't%20need%20to,salicylic%20acid%20or%20benzoyl%20peroxide.%E2%80%9D), \"We need to strengthen this barrier in order to keep bacteria out and prevent more breakouts.\" There are a number of essential oils that deeply hydrate the skin while also providing anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial benefits that combat acne. These include tea tree, lavender, rosemary and [clove](https://www.umaoils.com/blogs/news/ayurvedic-spice-cabinet-how-clove-soothes-colds-clears-skin-protects-the-liver-more?_pos=1&_sid=3473b6e51&_ss=r).
