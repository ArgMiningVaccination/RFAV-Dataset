Beyond the physical space, the notion of home speaks to the space where we may nd respite and solace by turning inwards and dropping into our heart to nd belonging and inner strength. The heart is also where we nd our passion, express love and compassion; linked to the re element and the season of summer, in the Chinese ve element theory. As we approach the middle of July, we also enter the astrological time period of the re sign of Leo (from July 22 - August 22, 2021). The sign of Leo is ruled by the Sun, the brightest star in our solar system and the center of our life force. Just as the sun provides us sustenance for life, we are reliant on a healthy functioning heart for our human existence. Interestingly to note, the sign of Leo governs the heart, the spine and the upper back part of the body. The physical function of the heart, a small muscular organ about the size of our st, is responsible for pumping and circulating blood throughout the body, supplying oxygen and nutrients to our tissue, removing waste and carbon dioxide, while regulating body temperature. Similar to our dependence on the sun, the heart is the driving life force that has a tremendous impact on our emotional, mental, and spiritual state. In my recent musing about the approaching Leo season and its connection to the heart I reflect upon the wise words of Nicholas Culpeper (1616-1654 AD), a renowned English botanist, herbalist, physician and astrologer, who recognized the connection of herbal plants, essential oils and astrology. In his quoted statement, \"Calendula is an herb of the sun, and under Leo. The flowers strengthen the heart exceedingly.\" To dive into a deeper understanding of the healing powers of calendula as a glorious Leo sun flower refer to the PDF download created by Aromatic Studies, which you can download [here.](https://aromaticdownloads.s3.amazonaws.com/About+Calendula+2020.pdf) The heart connects to love and compassion, sadness and loss, joy and happiness. A \"broken\" heart from grief may have a crippling impact to the physical body, and when in a state of bliss, may trigger the rush of endorphins or hormones released throughout the brain and nervous system. According to Ayurveda, the traditional hindu system of medicine, the heart is associated with the heart chakra, an energetic eld that resides in and around the body, also known as anahata- a sanskrit word that translates to \"unhurt\" and is recognized as the center of compassion, love, empathy and forgiveness. Recent modern research has identied the heart eld to generate an electromagnetic rhythmic force measurable up to 10 feet beyond the physical body in all directions, according to a non-prot research organization known as HeartMath. When we bring love and attention to the heart, we are affecting all levels of awareness. The use of herbs and essential oils offers that potential to create a positive impact mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually. Some (of my) recommended essential oils to support a harmonious heart include but are not limited to are yarrow, neroli, helichrysum, clary sage, rose, lavender, frankincense. With the upcoming full moon on July 23rd, it is an opportune time for release and letting go, so embrace your inner Leo energy, shine from your heart to release what no longer serves you in your life. Practice a daily meditation ritual along with a recipe, highlighted below. By instituting the conscious practice of cultivating love and compassion into a daily routine, there may be great rewards of inner peace found in the heart that one can return home to often.
