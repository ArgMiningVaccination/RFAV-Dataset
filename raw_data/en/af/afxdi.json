The main differences between conventional (allopathic) medical doctors and naturopathic medical doctors lie in the philosophies and paradigm of thought. The 6 main philosophies and therefore oaths taken by Naturopathic Physicians are: 1) First, do no harm. 2) Prevention is the key to health quality. 3) Treat each patient as a unique individual. 4) Consider the whole patient, body, mind, and spirit. 5) Nature has the ability to heal and the body can heal itself. 6) Doctor as teacher. (Dr. Pilcher's favorite one!) Dr. Pilcher is available for a free 15 minute phone consult to meet her and find out how she can help you with your individual needs and life-long wellness plan.
