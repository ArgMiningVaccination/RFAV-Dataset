WHAT INFLUENCED HER TO STUDY NATURAL MEDICINE? \"When I was 18 years old, I lived on a tall ship and visited many remote communities who still practiced traditional healing systems and cultural rituals where plants played a central role. While visiting one such community in Samoa, my crewmates and I were invited to attend a traditional 'Ava Ceremony, where part of the custom involved preparing kava roots (Piper methysticum) and then sharing it as a drink in a hierarchical order, and ultimately honouring us as guests. Although I didn't understand the spoken words or all of the symbolism of the ceremony at that time, the experience influenced my reverence for the importance of plants in culture and sparked an interest in how humans use plants in ceremony and as medicine.\" HEALTH PHILOSOPHY AND APPROACH TO CARE Dr. Jacquie's core approach emphasizes whole body medicine with individualized treatment plans, tailored lab work, and Naturopathic modalities that best suit the patient's needs. During each visit, she takes time to teach patients about physiology and how their symptoms relate to their health. In this way, she hopes to empower people to take care of their own body in an informed way. She uses a mind-body approach and provides a therapeutic space where patients can discuss mental-emotional symptoms, in addition to physical concerns. Dr. Jacquie, ND has a diversified family practice and welcomes patients of all ages. She has treated many people over the years, with a variety of health conditions and diagnoses. She has a special interest in digestive health, women's health, pregnancy and chronic pain. Stress reduction and energy support are a common pillar in her practice, to ensure that patients have vitality to pursue their interests and ultimately lead a meaningful life. \"I love practicing mind-body medicine because patients not only see their physical health improve, but they actually feel better on all levels. I am continually inspired by witnessing others reflect and make lasting positive change in "}
