Telephone triage is an essential element of patient care delivery, and is designed primarily to facilitate access to care and to provide consultation and assistance to patients and their families. The primary purpose of telephone triage is to assure patient safety and improve quality of care. Telephone triage is an interdependent nursing activity that is performed by a Registered Nurse in collaboration with a licensed physician or nurse practitioner. Telephone Triage Nursing at the Jicarilla Service Unit The Jicarilla Service Unit in northern New Mexico has had a telephone triage nurse (TTN) since mid\u00ad2003. It is a full time position, handling approximately 40 \u00ad60 calls each day. If the triage nurse is already on the line and cannot answer the call, a very detailed and informed recording directs the caller to leave a message, or to hang up and dial 911 if it is a life threatening emergency. Messages are returned as quickly as possible, usually in less than 15 minutes. On occasion, it may take up to 60 minutes, depending on the call volume that day. Calls after clinic hours are returned the following day.

The TTN is also a resource for patients to provide direction and immediate follow\u00adup for issues such as depression/suicide, domestic violence, or any other behavioral health concerns Provide home care information/advice. An acute care physician always reviews and initials a home advice encounter Transfer callers to other departments (e.g., a referral question can be better answered by the Contract Health Clerk) Consult with acute care physician or patient's primary care provider for assistance in determining patient disposition Special situations: pregnancy tests/UTIs/frequent routine labs \u00ad\u00adwhen a patient requires only one of the standing orders procedures, the TTN can enter a note in EHR, order laboratory tests, and instruct the patient to come to the clinic. The patient registers upon arrival and goes directly to the lab for the ordered procedure. The patient will then have a face\u00adto\u00adface encounter with the TTN for vital signs and be requested to wait in the waiting room for results or call back for results. The TTN will provide the patient with laboratory results once reviewed by a provider. If medication is needed, the provider will at that time place the order in EHR and the TTN will notify the patient of the need to go to pharmacy. Outcomes The program was started in mid 2003. It took time to gain acceptance of the community, but once all the nursing staff obtained the proper training and had all legal aspects of telephone triage in place, the telephone consultations increased quickly, and have averaged well over 2,000 per year among an Figure 1.

In 2010, telephone consultations increased to over 3,000, mainly due to community concerns about H1N1 (see Figure 1). Over the last five years, most patients (66%) were female. By age, 33% were under 19 years of age, 48% 19 \u00ad49 years, and 19% were 50+ years old. The percentage of calls/visits that did not require an in\u00ad person appointment averaged over 25%. The nursing staff feel confident that telephone triage has reduced the number of unnecessary appointments and walk\u00adin visits, due to the home care advice given and also the lab appointments that are handled by the TTN that do not require a provider visit. Although a TTN phone consultation in and of itself is not a chargeable visit, the decrease in unnecessary provider visits has left more open appointment slots for those patients really needing to be seen. It has also helped educate the community on health care issues that can be treated at home and that do not require a visit to the clinic. The TTN can provide a very private encounter that has helped some patients be more acceptable to STD screening and treatment for self and partner, since they do not have to call for an appointment or give information as to why they need to be seen. If the TTN has triaged the patient and determined that the patient does not need to see a provider, then this is an opportunity for the TTN to inform the patient of needed upcoming/overdue screenings, immunizations, or routine appointments. Many of Dulce's GPRA scores are excellent, attributable in part to the TTN. Nine 2010 GPRA measures were 80% or higher at Dulce (see Figure 2). The TTN Position is Highly Regarded by Community and Providers The TTN is a well\u00adrespected position in Dulce. For the community, it provides a well\u00adknown and trusted point of contact. For persons who are unsure whether to come to the clinic, the TTN provides guidance, education, and assurance. For patients with a sensitive purpose of visit such as an issue around reproductive health, the TTN provides a confidential route to lab testing and follow up. Patient concerns pertaining to sexually transmitted disease symptoms, testing, and follow up are well suited to the TTN model. Figure 2. 2010 GPRA 2011 THE IHS PROVIDER 115 Dulce is a small, rural community. Having TTNs who know the people of the community helps the service gain acceptance and trust. TTNs are rare in the Indian Health Service, but may be of great value to many service units. Special trainings, reference books, and protocols are available for TTNs.

A third party call will be accepted only in emergencies or for patients under 18 years of age If a caller will not disclose their name, the TTN is under no obligation to triage or give home care information Patients who received home care instructions are called back to assure improvement or offered an appointment in 48 \u00ad72 hours TTN responsibilities supersede clinical care responsibilities except in emergencies June 2011 THE IHS PROVIDER 116 Implementation of a Mandatory Employee Influenza Vaccination Program in a Rural Tribal Health Care Facility Deborah Farrell, MSN, Infection Prevention/Employee Health Manager, Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation, Tuba City, Arizona; Margaret Kraft, PhD, RN, Assistant Professor, Niehoff School of Nursing, Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois; and Jane Oski, MD, Department of Pediatrics, Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation Abstract During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, 426 H1N1 deaths were reported in 12 states that represent more than 50% of the American Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) population. In Arizona, where AIs comprise only 4.9% of the total population, they accounted for 18% of all confirmed H1N1 hospitalizations and 20% of all confirmed H1N1 deaths. The AI hospitalization rate for confirmed H1N1 in Arizona is 14.4 per 100,000; the rate for non\u00adAI persons in Arizona is 3.9 per 100,000, making the AI hospitalization rate 3.7 times higher than the non\u00adAI rate. Despite documentation in the literature that health care personnel (HCP) are responsible for nosocomial transmission of influenza and the recommendations for universal immunization of HCP from national advisory committees, HCP continue to have unacceptably low vaccination rates. Despite an aggressive employee influenza vaccination program, the Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation (TCRHCC), has never exceeded 89% for vaccinated employees. In 2010, TCRHCC adopted a mandatory influenza vaccination policy for all employees. Lewin's 3\u00adstage model of change was selected as the framework for the process change. A force field analysis showed that the positive driving forces of patient safety, improved outcomes, decreased staff illness, decreased absenteeism, and community health benefits outweighed the resisting factors of fear, misunderstanding, and misconception. Resistance to change was managed by restructuring policy to direct behavior change. As the patient advocate, the Infection Prevention/Employee Health (IP/EH) Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) was in a unique position to influence health policy and implement evidence\u00adbased practice changes. Understanding the issues, the challenges, and the stakeholders, the IP/EH APN utilized Lewin's framework to implement institution\u00adwide changes that increased the influenza vaccination rate from 89% to 97% within one month of policy implementation. Introduction Influenza is a viral infection that primarily infects the nose, throat, bronchi, and occasionally the lungs. The virus is efficiently transmitted person\u00adto\u00adperson by droplets and secretions from coughing, sneezing, and by self\u00adinnoculation of mucosal surfaces from hand contamination. Influenza illness is often characterized by the sudden onset of a high fever, coughing, sneezing, sore throat, and body aches. Seasonal influenza occurs annually, while pandemics occur when there is a global influenza outbreak as the result of a new strain of influenza.1 Vaccine is available for seasonal influenza but no vaccine readily exists at the start of a pandemic. Influenza and pneumonia were the eighth leading cause of death in the US in 2006, with an estimated 56,326 deaths attributed.2 The mortality rate for influenza alone is estimated to be approximately 36,000 annually with mortality highest among the very young, very old, and chronically ill. Using data from four different studies, King, et al,3 estimated that there are 200 million days of restricted activity, 75 million days of absenteeism, 22 million health care visits, and 110,000 hospitalizations annually as the result of infection with influenza. In 2009, pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus spread rapidly across the US, eventually infecting an estimated 43 to 89 million people between April 2009 and April 2010. Related hospitalizations were estimated to be 195,000 to 403,000, with an death toll of 8,870 to 18,300.4 The burden of disease among American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) was estimated to be four times higher than in non\u00adnatives. During the period April 15 to November 15, 2009, data showed a disproportionate number of H1N1 influenza deaths among AI/AN populations in a 12\u00adstate cohort representing 50% of the AI/AN population. A total of 426 deaths from influenza A (H1N1) was reported by the 12\u00adstate cohort (AL, AK, AZ, MI, NM, ND, OK, OR, WA, WY) with forty\u00adtwo deaths (9.9%) occurring among AI/AN's leading to a population mortality rate of 3.7/100,000. This rate is more than four times higher than the 0.9/100,000 mortality rate for all other racial/ethnic populations. The majority of the AI/AN deaths occurred in Arizona (16) and New Mexico (8).5 Historically AI/AN have suffered disproportionately from influenza. During the 1918 pandemic, the mortality rate for AI in Arizona was 11.3%, New Mexico 11.3% and Utah 15.9%.6 June 2011 THE IHS PROVIDER 117 During the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, between April and November 2009, disparity continued to exist between AI/AN and all other racial ethnic groups. In Arizona, where AI comprise 4.9% of the population, 18% of all confirmed H1N1 hospitalizations and 20% of all confirmed H1N1 deaths occurred in AI. The AI hospitalization rate for confirmed 2009 H1N1 in Arizona is 14.4 per 100,000; the rate for non\u00adAI persons in Arizona is 3.9 per 100,000, making the AI hospitalization rate 3.7 times higher than the non\u00adAI rate.5 AI/AN experienced the highest mortality at a rate four times greater than other racial/ethnic groups. The number of deaths among AI/AN in Arizona and New Mexico were 16 and 8 respectively.8 Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation (TCRHCC), the largest employer in the area, is a licensed 72\u00adbed tribal facility serving more than 35,000 AI/ANs located on the Navajo Nation in northeastern Arizona. The facility employs an average of 1076 health care personnel (HCP). HCP is defined as all workers: facility\u00adpaid, volunteer, student, resident, or Navajo Nation employees. The outpatient department, consisting of more than 20 specialty clinics, averages approximately 180,000 outpatient visits per year. The majority of HCPs are AIs with close ties to the community and extensive clan relationships. While a small percentage of employees commute long distances, the majority of professionals, including non\u00adNatives, live in government provided housing. Due to the closeness of the community, both groups have increased opportunities for exposure and transmission. Background As previously mentioned, AIs in Arizona suffered disproportionally from infection with H1N1. The first case of H1N1 in Tuba City was diagnosed in May 2009. The staff of TCRHCC experienced a high incidence of employee absenteeism between May 2009 and February 2010. Four employees were hospitalized with H1N1, including one who required admission to an intensive care unit. Lost work time for the four employees averaged 10 days with a range of 5 to 20 days. Numerous HCPs were infected with influenza A and presumably influenza A (H1N1) (Farrell, unpublished data). Nosocomial transmission. Nosocomial transmission of respiratory disease in hospitals and long\u00adterm care facilities has been well documented in the literature. During the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Canada, more than 70% of the affected HCWs did not use personal protective equipment (PPE) while providing direct patient care.8 A survey of 133 on\u00adduty nurses at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong found that 23% developed an influenza\u00adlike illness (ILI) during peak influenza season. Independent risk factors included suboptimal adherence to droplet precautions (masking) and failure to receive influenza vaccination.9 Unvaccinated HCWs and children hospitalized with community\u00adacquired influenza were identified as the major source of nosocomial influenza among pediatric patients.10 A study of 1,520 patients in 75 United Kingdom National Health Service Hospitals identified 30 patients with noscomial H1N1 infection. Although they were unable to determine where and from whom the patients acquired influenza (e.g., visitor vs. HCP), the death rate was 27%.11 Berg, et al25 reported on an outbreak of nosocomial influenza in 13 out of 22 hospitalized patients suffering from emphysema and concluded that HCW staff was the probable source of infection. A HCW was also suspected as the source of an outbreak of influenza in a neonatal intensive care unit in 2000 where one death occurred among 19 infected infants.13 A randomized trial of influenza vaccination in nursing home staff found a strong correlation between staff vaccination uptake and the all\u00adcause mortality rates of residents. The results showed that vaccination of staff reduced the incidence of ILI in the residents and led to a decrease in staff absenteeism.14 HCP Influenza Vaccination. Studies focusing on the rates of HCP influenza vaccination have found that despite recommendations, the rate of vaccination remains low. Estimates from the CDC place HCP influenza vaccination rates at 40 to 50%.15 Other studies estimate a seasonal vaccination rate of 61.9% and an H1N1 vaccination rate of 34.7% during the 2009 - 2010 influenza season.16 It is also a known fact that HCP go to work ill where they can unknowingly shed virus and transmit infection. A study conducted in Glasgow following the 1993 \u00ad4 influenza epidemic found that 23% of 120 unvaccinated HCP had serological evidence of influenza infection. Of the 120 HCP, 59% could not recall having influenza and 28% could not recall having any type of respiratory infection.17 Considering that they were asymptomatic, it is likely they engaged in direct patient care. Another study found that 50% of HCP who reported an influenza\u00adlike illness (ILI) during the 2004 \u00ad 2005 flu season continued to work and have patient contact while ill.18 In a random sampling of 1,000 inpatient nurses at the Mayo Clinic, a study found that the majority of the registered nurses (RNs) reported going to work when ill with ILI.19 A more recent anonymous survey conducted in an urban academic setting to assess resident physicians' attitudes and behavior during the 2009 H1N1 influenza season found that 62% of residents and 9% of medical students who reported having an ILI continued to work or go to school despite being ill.20 Several studies have attempted to identify characteristics among HCWs who refuse influenza vaccination. A nationwide survey of HCPs in Northern Greece identified two main reasons for refusing vaccination: 43.2% felt they were not at risk and 33.4% feared adverse side effects.21 A cross\u00adsectional study done at the Bronx\u00adLebanon Hospital Center (Bronx, NY) found that the decision to be vaccinated is influenced by both personal and systemic factors. Nurses who were not vaccinated (45.4%) had ill\u00adfounded beliefs about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. They believed they were not at risk of becoming ill and were afraid of getting sick from the June 2011 THE IHS PROVIDER 118 vaccine.22 After implementation of a mandatory influenza vaccination program at the National Institute of Health (NIH) in 2008, a survey was conducted to identify reasons for declination of vaccination. Of the 2,754 employees, 294 (10.6%) formally declined vaccination. The most frequent reasons cited were concerns about side effects (39.1%); a belief they were not at risk (20.7%); vaccine was not effective (17.7%); and a belief that it was harmful (11.6%). Additionally, 11.6% of the staff declining indicated they thought they could get influenza from the vaccine.23 Regional Vaccination Rates. Despite the documented benefits for both patients and workers, the HCP vaccination rate falls below the Health and Human Service (HHS) Healthy People goal of 60% for 2010. Future goals are 70% for 2015 and 90% for 2020.24 Navajo Area Indian Health Service (NAIHS), which includes eight Indian Health and tribal facilities, reported that 80% of HCP received seasonal influenza vaccination and 66% received H1N1 vaccination during the 2009 \u00ad2010 influenza season.25 TCRHCC, also included in the NAIHS numbers, fared better than most regional and Navajo Nation facilities with vaccination rates of 78%, 83% and 89% respectively for the years 2007 \u00ad 2009. Rates for H1N1 vaccination, however, were lower with 50%. Reasons cited for declination ranged from vaccine shortage to fear of side effects. The Need for Change. TCRHCC employs an aggressive HCP influenza vaccination program utilizing mobile vaccination carts, convenient hours, incentives, and declination forms. Despite the 89% vaccination rate for seasonal influenza, the Epidemiological Response Team (ERT) felt that 89% was not sufficient when it came to protecting patients and that the goal must be 100%. In February 2010, the ERT members reviewed an article highlighting the success of Virginia Mason Medical Center, Hospital Corporation of America, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in mandating vaccination for HCP.26 Historical vaccination data, disease burden, and facts about the benefits of influenza vaccination were given to the ERT members to review. The members were asked to entertain the idea of mandatory vaccination and be prepared to discuss and make a decision at the May 2010 meeting. At that meeting, the ERT members voted unanimously to propose a mandatory influenza vaccination program for all employees. Those employees who chose to decline vaccination on the grounds of a medical contraindication or religious reasons would be required to wear a mask covering their nose and mouth during influenza season November 1 through March 31. Methods The ERT appointed the IC/EH nurse to act as project manager and established a target date of full compliance for November 1. As part of the strategic plan, Lewin's 3\u00adstep change theory was selected as the framework to implement the change management process. Lewin, a social scientist, viewed behavior as the dynamic balance of driving and restraining forces. The driving forces push employees into the desired direction while restraining forces oppose change.27 The first step was to identify forces that would facilitate or impede the proposed change. Driving forces included supporting literature, improved patient outcomes, decreased staff illness and absenteeism, patient and community safety, and decreased health care costs. Restraining forces included fear of side effects, false belief of not being at risk for illness, lack of confidence in the vaccine, inconvenient administrations times, and the belief that vaccination policies are coercive and violate the right to choose. The masking mandate was anticipated to be the most controversial and most difficult to enforce. To support this, the IC/EH nurse conducted a literature review to gather supporting evidence before proceeding on to the next phase. Poalillo31 reported that the H1N1 virus may have an asymptomatic carrier rate as high as 9%, while Carlson32 found that asymptomatic influenza infection may account for up to 66% of all influenza cases. With the consensus of the ERT, that mandatory influenza vaccination should become a part of the culture of the facility and thus a condition of employment, the ERT needed to secure the buy\u00adin of senior leaders. Supporting literature, including the position statements of national committees; the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)30 was presented to the Nurse Executive Council (NEC). The NEC, a committee of approximately 22 supervisory clinical nurses including the IP/EH nurse, the Assistant Chief Nurse and the Director of Nursing, has oversight over the largest group of hospital employees. The NEC unanimously supported both the vaccination and masking requirements. The policy was then presented to the Medical Executive Committee (MEC) where some resistance was expressed by those who were opposed to any influenza vaccination and those who argued that masking would not be enforceable. Despite objections, the policy passed with a majority vote. The policy was then presented to the Senior Leadership Committee (SLC) where opposition to masking was voiced but the policy was approved. On September 1, 2010, the Mandatory Influenza Vaccination for Employees policy was signed by the President of the Hospital Board of Directors. Immediately, the IP/EH nurse began to communicate the policy changes to the staff via e\u00admail, flyers, and departmental meetings. Excerpts from literature demonstrating that AIs have a four times higher death rate from H1N1 and articles about HCP vaccination rates were distributed. The target date for 100% compliance was set for November 1, 2010, the date on which all employees who declined vaccination would be required to mask while on duty. An employee mass vaccination was conducted on October 7, 2010 in the hospital cafeteria. Subway $5 gift cards were given to employees receiving vaccination. Between the hours of 7:30 am and 11:30 am, over 400 employees, including SLC members, presented for June 2011 THE IHS PROVIDER 119 vaccination. The team returned that evening from 6 pm to 8 pm to vaccinate an additional 122 employees. Following the mass vaccination day, the IP/EH nurse utilized the mobile cart system and one\u00adon\u00adone appointments to reach the majority of the remaining employees. Some employees elected to receive their flu shot in the immunization clinic or through a private provider and were required to provide proof of vaccination. Any employee who declined vaccination was required to sign a declination form and acknowledge that they would be required to wear a mask while on duty. By the target date, 97% (1048) of employees had been vaccinated, 2% (26) had declined vaccination, and 1% (2) had been listed as unaccounted for due to extended medical leave status. Sustaining the change. Change is not always comfortable and acceptance may not come quickly for everyone. Change brings about a new equilibrium that requires stabilization through the development and reinforcement of institutional policies and procedures. The mandatory influenza policy has been embraced as part of the culture and mission of TCRHCC. Feedback on vaccination rates was communicated regularly to the staff through e\u00admails and flyers. To avoid any unexpected surprises, all potential and new hires are informed of the policy prior to the offer of a position. Departmental managers are responsible for enforcement of the mask requirement and have done an excellent job in monitoring compliance. With only 26 refusals, non\u00adcompliance was relatively easy to observe and corrected on the spot. Any refusal to comply with the hospital policy placed the employee into a progressive disciplinary process. Discussion One of the major obstacles was the opposition of the key medical providers. As leaders, medical officers are expected to support the mission and values of the organization. Ottenberg, et al31 cited the American Medical Association's (AMA) recently published statement, \"physicians have the obligation to accept immunization absent a recognized medical, religious, or philosophical reason to not be immunized and accept a decision of the medical staff leadership of health care institutions, or other appropriate authority to adjust practice activities if not immunized. It reasonable to require a physician who declined vaccination, to wear a mask or refrain from direct patient contact\" in their commentary discussing the legal and ethical issues of mandatory vaccination. The AMA's position on mandatory vaccination and practice changes is another driving force that supports the program's objectives.32 Also encountered were several employees who had histories of allergies and/or adverse reactions who insisted on receiving influenza vaccination instead of masking. Successful vaccine uptake was obtained in the immunization clinic under the supervision of a medical provider for all but one employee. In addition to the Subway card incentive, pizza parties were provided for six departments reaching 100% compliance on the first day of the campaign. Feedback to employees is a crucial component of any successful program, and thus vaccination rates were made available to all staff. Department supervisors in turn provided additional recognition to their department, further supporting and recognizing the success of the program. Conclusion Identifying the need for change and creating an atmosphere where change will be accepted is a tall order in any work environment as many staff exhibit reluctance to leave their comfort zone. With a wide range of skill and knowledge, the APN is the ideal agent to influence change. Using Lewins's framework, the IP/EH APN was successful in identifying the need for change, implementing an action plan, and establishing a state of equilibrium that will assist in sustaining the change. Through a summary of the literature, the IP/EH APN was able to overcome resistance by providing evidence\u00adbased research supporting the claim that influenza vaccination is the simplest, safest and most effective tool in protecting patients from noscomial transmission of influenza. As with any other successful program, the tendency to become complacent is a part of human nature. To continue to have a successful program, there must be a continuing staff education program, monitoring of vaccination rates, feedback, and re\u00adevaluation. References 1.

This paper discusses relevant information for health care providers concerning the FDA risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS). Background1\u00ad2 The FDA is an agency under the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Over the years, many different amendments and laws were enacted that led to the present FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) of 1938 contained several key provisions, including safety requirements for new medications. The Durham\u00adHumphrey Amendment of 1951 defined types of medication that required medical supervision and thus, limited the sale of these products by prescription only from a licensed practitioner. The Kefauver\u00adHarris Drug Amendments of 1962 provided requirements for manufacturers to prove effectiveness of products and strengthened safety requirements. In 1970, the FDA required a package insert to be included with oral contraceptives that discussed risks and benefits of use. In September 2007, the FDCA was amended by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA). These amendments granted new authority to the FDA. One such authority was the ability to require manufacturers of new or existing drug or biologic products to develop and comply with REMS. What are REMS? As the name implies, REMS are safeguard actions, developed by a drug sponsor, approved by FDA, whose goal is to ensure safe use of a product by patients. Prior to FDAAA, Risk Minimization Action Plans (RiskMAPs) were used to minimize risks for new drug products and many were \"grandfathered\" to become REMS at the time FDAAA was enacted.3\u00ad5 After FDAAA, the FDA was granted expanded ability to regulate post market drug safety.1 One avenue to improve drug safety was via the REMS requirements. REMS are specific to a drug product and individually tailored to help mitigate a potential safety issue. This risk management plan uses minimization strategies that go beyond what the product label contains. The FDA may require a drug sponsor to develop REMS: Before drug approval, if the FDA determines a REMS is necessary to ensure the benefit of a drug coming to market outweighs the risk associated with its use After approval, if the FDA identifies new safety information and determines a REMS is necessary to ensure the benefit of a drug remaining on the market outweighs the risk associated with its use REMS requirements vary depending on drug product and the safety risk associated with the use of the product. There are different types of requirements that the FDA may impose for a particular drug product, and may include multiple requirements. These include: A Medication Guide or patient package insert (PPI) A Communication Plan for health care providers Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU) An Implementation System Each of these will be discussed individually. Medication Guide5\u00ad7 Prior to the draft guidance for Medication Guides, this was the most frequently employed requirement associated with REMS. This type of REMS is geared toward education of patients through the dispensation of FDA approved patient\u00ad friendly labeling. With this requirement, the FDA requires that a Medication Guide be issued at the dispensation of the prescribed medication or biologic. The FDA may require a Medication Guide if: patient labeling could help prevent serious adverse events a serious side effect is known that could affect the patient's decision to use or continue use of the drug patient adherence to directions is crucial for product effectiveness The manufacturer is responsible for ensuring Medication Guides are available to be dispensed to the patient by health care providers. There is a draft guidance that is under public review that modifies the requirements for Medication Guide dispensation in certain settings and should further clarify dispensing requirements (Table 1). Additionally, this draft guidance modifies the requirement of Medication Guides as a part of REMS and \"in most cases, FDA expects to include a Medication Guide in a REMS only when the REMS includes elements to assure safe use.\"5 June 2011 THE IHS PROVIDER 122 Table 1. Draft Medication Guide Enforcement Discretion Policy5 Setting Patient or Patient's Agent Requests Medication Guide Medication Guide Distributed Each Time Drug Dispensed Medication Guide Distributed At Time of First Dispensing Medication Guide Distributed When Medication Guide Materially Changed Inpatient Must dispense Medication Guide FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion; Medication Guide need not be dispensed FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion; Medication Guide need not be dispensed FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion; Medication Guide need not be dispensed Outpatient when dispensed to health care professional for administration to patient (e.g., clinic, infusion center) Must dispense Medication Guide FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion; Medication Guide need not be dispensed Must dispense Medication Guide Must dispense Medication Guide Outpatient when dispensed directly to patient or caregiver (e.g., retail pharmacy, hospital ambulatory pharmacy) Must dispense Medication Guide Must dispense Medication Guide Must dispense Medication Guide Must dispense Medication Guide Note: When a drug is subject to a REMS that includes specific requirements for the review of a Medication Guide (possibly in conjunction with distribution), FDA does not intend to exercise enforcement discretion regarding those specific requirements set forth in the REMS (e.g., when health care providers are required to review the Medication Guide with patients before patients are enrolled in a REMS program as an element to assure safe use). Communication Plan The FDA may require a manufacturer of a drug or biologic to submit a communication plan as part of REMS requirements. These are approved materials, targeted at health care providers, to provide information about serious risk(s) associated with a drug or biologic, and may include information on implementing the REMS. The communication plan may include sending letters to health care providers, disseminating information to health care providers through professional societies, and specific information about REMS elements, such as monitoring parameters, protocols, or laboratory testing requirements.7 Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU)/Implementation System A less frequently employed option under REMS is the use of ETASU. These are specifically required items, intended to provide safe access to certain drugs with known serious safety concerns listed in the approved labeling of a drug or biologic. These requirements may include:7 Requiring specific training, experience, or certification for health care providers who prescribe the drug Requiring pharmacies, practitioners, or health care settings that dispense the drug to be specially certified Requiring the drug to dispensed only in certain health care settings, such as hospitals Requiring the drug to be dispensed only to patients with evidence or other documentation of certain safe\u00ad use conditions such as laboratory tests Requiring specific monitoring for patients using the drug Requiring enrollment of patients using the drug into a specific registry For example, Oxycontin\u00ae (oxycodone HCL controlled\u00ad release) tablets, an opioid agonist, has REMS requirements associated with its use. The goals are to inform patients and health care professionals about the potential for abuse, misuse, overdose, and addiction, as well as the safe use of this product. The REMS requirements include the dispensation of a Medication Guide with each prescription. Each bottle will have one copy of the full prescribing information, two copies of the approved Medication Guide, and will include a prominent statement on the container packaging instructing, \"authorized dispensers to provide a Medication Guide.\"8\u00ad9 June 2011 THE IHS PROVIDER 123 ETASU elements are also required for this product and include a training requirement, a \"Dear Healthcare Professional\" letter to be mailed to prescribers and a requirement for the manufacturer to maintain a list of all prescribers who completed the training. Additionally, prescribers will be re\u00adtrained every two years as part of this REMS.9 It should be noted that the FDA and members of the pharmaceutical industry are working to implement a single shared system REMS for long\u00adacting and extended release opioids; therefore, please continue to watch for more information regarding opioid REMS.10 An implementation system may also be required when ETASU that require certification of pharmacies and hospitals, that limit the use to certain health care settings, or that require documentation of safe use conditions are part of the REMS. With this type of requirement, the drug sponsor must take reasonable steps to monitor and evaluate the implementation by health care providers, pharmacists and other parties in the health care system responsible for implementing the elements. The applicant must work to improve the implementation of these elements. Drug distribution may be affected by REMS; therefore the certification of the wholesaler and/or distributor may be required under the implementation system. The erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA; Epogen\u00ae, Procrit\u00ae: epoetin alfa; Aranesp\u00ae: darbepoetin alfa) provide a good example of a class that has each of the REMS elements when they are used for the treatment of cancer related anemia. A Medication Guide must be given with each dispensation of the product. This must be provided as long as treatment continues and should follow the requirements set forth in the REMS for distribution of Medication Guides.5 A health care professional communication was sent to nephrology professional societies, large dialysis organizations, nephrology group purchasing organizations, oncologists, hematologists, Directors of Pharmacy for hospitals, and other health care providers who may prescribe these products for patients with cancer. These agents have ETASU requirements for use in cancer related illness, via the ESA APPRISE Oncology Program. For providers who prescribe and dispense ESAs in private practice and in hospital\u00adbased settings, this includes certification, training (initial, then every three years) and attestation to their review of the APPRISE program requirements (not inclusive). Hospitals that dispense ESAs for treating patients with cancer must be certified as part of the APPRISE program. The manufacturer will assure that these products will be dispensed with documentation of safe\u00aduse conditions. Finally, an implementation system has been approved for these products. The manufacturer will monitor compliance with the ESA APPRISE Oncology Program via audits of private clinics and random sampling of hospitals. The manufacturer will ensure that these products are not distributed to facilities (hospital, private clinic, etc.) unless they are certified. Enforcement of REMS Elements associated with REMS are enforceable. FDAAA gave the FDA the authority to enforce drug sponsor compliance with REMS requirements and can deem a drug misbranded and potentially impose civil penalties for non\u00ad compliance. These enforcement actions can range from warning letters, injunctions, or monetary civil penalties of up to $10 million.11 If a dispute arises between a drug sponsor and the FDA regarding a post approval REMS requirement, the FDA Drug Safety and Oversight Board (DSB) may review the dispute.12 The IHS is a voting member of this board.12\u00ad13 The FDA enforcement of REMS speaks only to the drug sponsor; however, failure of providers and/or facilities to comply with REMS requirements could contribute to civil liability being assessed on the sponsor or cause the drug to be misbranded.14 FDA responsibilities with REMS After the manufacturer has submitted the REMS, it is the responsibility of the FDA to review the submission, provide comments to the sponsor, and approve the REMS. Additionally, through a Drug Safety and Risk Management (DSaRM) Advisory Committee meeting, the FDA must at least annually assess whether one or more ETASU REMS is meeting its intent of assuring safe use of a drug and is not unduly burdensome to patient access and the health care system. The FDA also assesses whether the manufacturer has appropriately assessed whether the REMS is meeting its goals and must provide the feedback in prescribed fashion.1 Current REMS The FDA periodically updates the list of medications with FDA\u00adapproved REMS. Since January 4, 2010, the list has 183.14\u00ad16 grown from 100 listings to The majority of the approved REMS only require a Medication Guide as the required element of the REMS (123). A communication plan is required of 49 of the approved REMS, while ETASU are required of 22.15 (See Figure 1.) Implications for IHS The IHS National Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee (NPTC) is responsible for increasing access to highly effective medications through formulary management, providing educational pieces for clinicians, and for maintaining the IHS National Core Formulary (NCF). At the time of this writing, the IHS NCF includes eight products that have REMS. Each of these eight included a Medication Guide as part of the REMS, two agents required a communication plan and none have a discussion, during the clinical presentation, of REMS when considering products for potential inclusion to the NCF. June 2011 THE IHS PROVIDER 124 Figure 1. Current FDA REMS (March 25, 2011)16 183 approved REMS 49 include a communication plan 180 include a Medication Guide 22 include ETASU 123 include only a Medication Guide 18 include implementation systems Relevant Acronyms FDA Food and Drug Administration REMS Risk evaluation and mitigation strategies DHHS Department of Health and Human Services FDCA Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 FDAAA Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 RiskMAPS Risk minimization action plans PPI Patient Package Insert ETASU Elements to assure safe use ESA Eythropoiesis stimulating agents NPTC IHS National Pharmacy Formulary PSG IHS Pharmacy Specialty Group APPRISE Assisting Providers and cancer Patients with Risk information for the Safe use of ESAs Additionally, the NPTC includes a REMS section in each clinical drug monographs. The IHS Pharmacy Specialty Group (PSG) discussed REMS in a recent meeting. This group is responsible for information resource management and technology, and serves as a central system to coordinate issues related to the pharmacy computer software.18 They are working to develop methods to improve the identification of REMS drugs, dispensation of Medication Guides and documentation of REMS elements. Additionally, they are looking to develop \"best practices\" that may include the use of automation prompts, EHR reminders, electronic signature pads and focused patient education codes. More information should be forthcoming. Facilities should begin looking at their system and identifying opportunities for REMS implementation. Considerations should be put in place for flagging of REMS agents, dispensation of Medication Guides, and documentation of REMS compliance. Implementing local policies and procedures for REMS should be considered. Area and local Pharmacy and Therapeutics committees should include discussions about REMS when considering new additions to formularies. Additionally, if medications with ETASU are used, facilities should assure compliance with the specific criteria. Closing The FDA REMS are currently in a period of change with the recent Draft Medication Guide Guidance.5 The requirements and application of this information is an important piece for IHS health care providers to understand. Health care professionals provide critical roles in assuring safe and appropriate use of medications. REMS elements and requirements should be implemented into the IHS medication use process. Implementation should be carefully thought out to assure the appropriate use of these medications in a fashion that does not serve as a burden for the provider. References 1. 110th Congress.

IHS Child Health Notes Quote of the month \"Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it for religious conviction.\" \u00ad\u00adPascal Articles of Interest Association between sexually transmitted diseases and young adults' self\u00adreported abstinence. Pediatrics. 2011 Feb;127(2):208\u00ad13. Epub 2011 Jan 3. Investigators examined the accuracy of self reported sexual behavior in a national sample of over 14,000 young adults (mean age 22 years) who underwent urine testing for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neiserria gonorrhea, and Trichomonas vaginalis. Interviews on sexual behavior were done via an audio computer self interview completed at home. Six percent of the subjects tested positive for at least one sexually transmitted infection; surprisingly nearly 11% of infected participants reported having abstained from sexual intercourse in the previous 12 months. Editorial Comment Obtaining a complete and accurate history is felt to be crucial in the practice of good clinical medicine. It is equally clear that many adolescents and adults may not feel comfortable disclosing sensitive information about sexual practices. There are potential explanations that could account for the 10% discrepant results between sexually transmitted infections and sexual behavior such as latent chlamydial infection in some women. However, given these results, some might argue that routine screening for sexually transmitted infections should be done regardless of clinical history. Infectious Disease Updates. Rosalyn Singleton, MD, MPH Meningococcal vaccine: Two vaccines, two doses, now for under two years The myriad of new recommendations and vaccines for meningococcal disease can make one dizzy. First, some quick disease facts: meningococcal disease is a rare, devastating infection presenting primarily as meningococcemia or meningitis. The incidence in the US is about 0.2 - 4 per 100,000, with peaks in infancy and age 16 \u00ad 21 years, and a case fatality rate of 10 \u00ad 25%. Meningococcal conjugate quadrivalent vaccines (Menactra\u00ae and Menveo\u00ae) routine recommendations were recently changed from one dose in adolescents to \"routine vaccination of adolescents (preferably at 11 \u00ad 12 years) with a booster dose at 16 years.\" The recommendations for high risk persons (e.g., asplenia, terminal complement disorder, etc.) aged 2 \u00ad 54 years have also been changed to a two\u00addose primary series. Why the change? The goal of the adolescent meningococcal dose was to protect persons 16 \u00ad 21 at the peak of disease; however, recent immunogenicity studies have shown that the vaccine may not provide protection for five years. Since meningococcal disease is rare and the vaccine is expensive, the extra dose was a contentious issue, with an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) vote of 5 to 4. There's more to come on meningococcal vaccines. Menactra\u00ae was just licensed down to nine months of age and Menveo\u00ae may be looking for licensure in infants. Also, a MenC/Hib vaccine is close to licensure for infants. With an already busy childhood vaccine schedule and high cost for a small number of cases, the routine use of meningococcal vaccine in infants will be a subject of intense debate. Recent literature on American Indian/Alaskan Native Health Jeff Powell, MD, MPH First Steps for Mommy and Me: A pilot intervention to improve nutrition and physical activity behaviors of postpartum mothers and their infants. Taveras E, Blackburn K, Gillman M, et al. Maternal and Child Health Journal, October 19, 2010 This month's focus is a small pilot intervention, \"Mommy and Me,\" a primary prevention approach to healthy behavior change among new mothers and their young infants. This review is a change of approach from past reviews, in that the study subjects are neither American Indian nor Alaska Native. I chose this small pilot, however, because it seems useful in the context of the focus on health promotion and disease prevention in Indian Country. What I find striking about this pilot is the simplicity and focus of the intervention, targeting the wellness of the mother/infant unit, not just mother or just the infant. In addition, the use of health educator implemented June 2011 THE IHS PROVIDER 127 motivational interviewing and primary pediatrician brief negotiation offers intriguing use of resources that may be adaptable to American Indian communities. The article summarizes the intervention and findings implemented by Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute. In summary, the study team developed and implemented a coordinated behavior change curriculum, enrolling 84 mothers/infant pairs (60 intervention pairs, 24 control \"usual care\" pairs). The study was prospective, non\u00ad randomized, controlled, and non\u00adblinded. The intervention pairs of mothers and infants were enrolled from two primary care practices, and the control pairs were enrolled from a separate individual pediatric practice. These pairs were followed from just after birth through six months of age. The study focused on \"healthful diet/infant feeding,\" television viewing, sleep measures, and mothers' physical activity. The intervention designed to impact these targets is elegant in design and in use of professional resources. The study team engaged primary care pediatric practices and utilized primary care pediatric providers and health educators. To support these personnel, education materials were provided to the intervention practices. The education was carried out using pediatric provider brief negotiation (a truncated version of motivational interviewing that is well\u00adsuited to clinic time constraints), and health educator motivational interviewing. The brief negotiation was carried out during already scheduled infant well child visits. The motivational interviewing was implemented using a series of between visit health educator telephone calls lasting 15 to 20 minutes. In addition to the phone calls, supportive group teaching sessions were conducted by the pediatric providers of the intervention practices. In addition to the modest numbers enrolled, the main limitations of this pilot are the short, six\u00admonth, intervention time, and the demographics of the enrolled mother/infant pairs. The pilot was carried out in a high socioeconomic status, well educated, and older mother demographic. This obviously limits the generalizability of this pilot program. Even so, I feel that this study holds promise for the \"real world\" because the intervention seems feasible in a non\u00adresearch environment. So while the patient population for this particular pilot limits the study usefulness, the nature of the intervention itself increases the study usefulness. Of course, the big question is, What about study effectiveness? In broad terms, the study looked at three types of results: mother and infant behavioral measures (based on evidence\u00adbased measurement tools); anthropometric outcomes (measurement of BMI, height for weight Z scores, etc.); and process outcomes (program acceptability and feasibility measures). Statistically significant outcomes included improved timing of introduction of solid foods, and improved sleep measures in the intervention infants. In addition, there was an important trend towards fewer very overweight (highest quartile of weight for length Z score) infants in the intervention group, though this finding was not statistically significant (22% of intervention infants versus 42% of control group infants were in the heaviest quartile, P = 0.06). Maternal behavior itself did not change with participation. In terms of program acceptance, the bottom line appears to be that mothers liked the program, would recommend it to a friend, and that primary care pediatric providers felt that the training and educational materials were very useful to their practice. While the \"Mommy and Me\" intervention lacks generalizability based upon intervention population, it is exciting research in pediatric prevention. First, it appears to be a relatively non\u00adresource intensive, realistic program amenable to broad implementation. Second, the intervention period in this pilot is very short - to have any positive outcomes in such a brief, six\u00admonth intervention is impressive. Finally, this program strikes me as compatible with the practice environments of AI/AN\u00adserving clinics. In our local system, for example, we have robust teams of health educators, providers already familiar with brief negotiation and motivational interviewing, and access to motivational interviewing training. In addition, a holistic approach to community and to health care over the lifespan offers opportunities to expand these approaches to include multiple children within a family, and to integrate with prenatal and even pre\u00adconception care. June 2011 THE IHS PROVIDER 128 April's issue of The IHS Provider recognized Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Awareness Month and, to raise awareness of the impact of STDs on the health of Native communities, the IHS National STD Program and its partners brought together a number of articles related to that topic. This month we publish three additional articles that did not make it into that issue, but which are equally important. Again, we are grateful to Scott Tulloch, BS, Program Manager, IHS National STD Program (CDC assignee), Albuquerque, New Mexico; Lori de Ravello, MPH, Public Health Advisor, IHS National STD Program (CDC assignee), Albuquerque; and Melanie Taylor, MD, IHS National STD Program (CDC assignee), Phoenix, Arizona for their devotion to this important problem and their work to get the word out in The Provider. National Chlamydia Coalition Mini\u00adGrant: Increasing Chlamydia Screening and Follow\u00adUp in IHS, Tribal and Urban Indian Health Programs Wendy Nakatsukasa\u00adOno, MPH, Program Director, Center for Health Training, Seattle, Washington In 2010, the National Chlamydia Coalition (NCC) awarded a \"mini\u00adgrant\" to the Center for Health Training to develop a model protocol and decision tool/flowchart to guide standard delivery of STD care to AI/AN at risk for chlamydia and other STDs. This effort was undertaken in partnership with the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, IHS National STD Program, JSI Research & Training Institute, Region VIII Infertility Prevention Project, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board, and the Phoenix Indian Medical Center. Consistent with the NCC grants program, the goal of the project is to increase chlamydia screening and follow\u00adup care among AI/AN.

June 2011 THE IHS PROVIDER 129 Native STAND (Students Together Against Negative Decisions): Evaluating a School\u00adbased Sexual Risk Reduction Intervention Carol Grimes, MPH, Program Evaluator, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board, Portland, Oregon Compared to other US teens, American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth experience significant sexual health disparities, including high teen birth rates and sexually transmitted illnesses (STIs). After experiencing more than a decade of decline, the teen birth rate increased 12% among AI/AN between 2005 and 2007 \u00ad\u00admore than that of any other racial or ethnic population.1 In 2009, young people (age 15 \u00ad 24) accounted for 67% of all chlamydia cases and 56% of all gonorrhea cases among AI/AN of all ages.2 Many factors contribute to these disparities, including poverty, stigma, insufficient and inaccessible health services, and persistent social norms that support substance abuse and sexual violence.3 Native STAND Curriculum Native STAND is a 29\u00adsession peer educator curriculum that covers a range of sexual and reproductive health topics, including communication and peer education skills. It is based on an intervention that was designed and evaluated among rural youth in the southern US and found to effectively increase condom self efficacy, HIV risk behavior knowledge, frequency of conversations with peers about birth control and STDs, and consistent condom use among participating students. In 2008, the curriculum was adapted for use among AI/AN youth by a multi\u00addisciplinary workgroup of partners working with AI/AN and topical experts; activities were pilot tested with small groups of youth from the target audience. Native STAND Evaluation A mixed\u00admethods study was conducted to evaluate the Native STAND curriculum in 2010. To more fully evaluate the adapted curriculum in Indian Country, 80 students attending four Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) boarding schools were selected by fellow students to be trained as peer educators using the Native STAND curriculum. The curriculum was delivered in 1\u00bd hour classes by two or three adult staff at each school, each of whom had been trained to facilitate the Native STAND curriculum. A comprehensive pre\u00ad and post\u00ad computer\u00adassisted self interview (CASI) survey was administered to participating students to assess changes in knowledge, attitudes, intentions, behaviors, and skills over time. At the end of the program, a series of focus groups and key informant interviews were also carried out with separate groups of students, facilitators, and school staff not directly involved in the program to identify programmatic strengths and weaknesses and to inform final program revisions. Quantitative Evaluation Methods\u2014Pre\u00adand Post\u00adSurvey To assess changes in student knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, intentions, behaviors, and skills, Native STAND students completed a CASI survey at the beginning of the program and again at its completion. The survey was administered using a web\u00adbased form, and was made up of 20 multi\u00aditem measures. Topics included Native self\u00adidentity, perceived life chances, sexual behavior history, STD/HIV prevention knowledge, condom use self\u00adefficacy, and partner communication. The survey questions were drawn and adapted from several existing questionnaires that have been implemented and validated in other settings. To verify comprehension, the tool was first pilot tested with 15 intertribal AI/AN youth attending an adolescent reproductive health training. Statistical analyses included response frequencies by gender, mean scores with standard deviations by item and composite measure index, and t\u00adtests to examine differences pre\u00adand post\u00adintervention. Qualitative Methods\u2014Focus Groups and Interviews Focus groups and interviews were conducted at each participating school approximately one to two weeks after completing the curriculum. In order to capture the full scope of possible responses, four different moderator guides were developed: a youth participant focus group guide, a staff and faculty focus group guide, a school administrator interview guide, and a Native STAND facilitator interview guide. With permission, discussions were taped using an audio recording device and/or detailed notes were taken by a designated notetaker. For analysis, a coding scheme with unique codes was developed by project evaluators and all transcripts and notes were read twice and coded. Qualitative data were then separated and reassembled by site (School #1, School #2, etc) and focus group/interview type (student, facilitator, administrator, etc) to examine outcomes by subset. June 2011 THE IHS PROVIDER 130 Evaluation Results The Native STAND program effectively educated and empowered AI/AN high school students at four BIE boarding schools to help their peers address sensitive adolescent health issues and concerns, including healthy relationships, sexual health, violence, and drug and alcohol use. After participating in the 29\u00adsession curriculum, students demonstrated significant improvements in knowledge of STD/HIV prevention, reproductive health, and healthy relationships. Youth at all four sites reported providing one\u00adon\u00adone counseling and referrals to their peers post intervention. Adult facilitators learned how to better communicate and teach about sensitive topics, and the program was well received by school staff and administrators, who recognized that the program addressed critical gaps in sexual health education on campus. The impacts of Native STAND are just beginning to take root and should continue to grow as new students are trained and past graduates take on their new roles as student peer educators. The energy and enthusiasm of the first group of students sparked interest among other students to participate the following year. More systematic changes in social norms and behavior can be expected after the \"diffusion of innovation\" moves throughout the school community. Ideally, future studies will continue to evaluate the program to see how peer educators take what they learned and apply it at their individual schools.

June 2011 THE IHS PROVIDER 131 HIV/STD Tribal Advocacy Kit and Policy Guide for AI/AN Tribal Leaders Colbie Caughlan, MPH, Project Coordinator, Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board, Portland, Oregon Tribal leaders and decision makers play a significant role in the health and wellbeing of tribal members. Their opinions are heard and respected. Their actions can influence others, and the tribal policies they create shape the lives of future generations. Because the decisions tribal leaders make can have such a long\u00adlasting impact, health professionals and policy advocates must strive to communicate with tribal decision makers about the important health challenges within their communities. The Indian Health Service (IHS) HIV/AIDS Program, with assistance from the Office of Minority Health and Resource Center (OMHRC) and Project Red Talon (PRT) of the Northwest Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB), designed the AI/AN Tribal HIV/STD Advocacy Kit and Policy Guide to specifically help tribal health advocates inform decision makers about the impact of STDs, HIV/AIDS, and unintended pregnancy on tribal health and the importance of implementing comprehensive prevention activities within their communities. The kit was also developed to aid health professionals and policy advocates in advancing sexual health program and policy initiatives within tribal communities. To effectively address teen pregnancy and STDs, including HIV, it is imperative that community members overcome their discomfort and begin to take the steps necessary to protect future generations. Many tribal communities and health clinics do not have policies in place that address prevention, testing, and the treatment of HIV and other STDs. This is where tribal health leaders can step in and advocate to address gaps in sexual health programs and policies. Tribal leaders are an important resource for encouraging healthy community discussion and outreach on sexual health topics, in addition to shaping the programs and policies that protect their community's health. The AI/AN Tribal HIV/STD Advocacy Kit will be available in April 2011 to all tribal communities that would like to gain support for policy implementation and other programmatic changes that can help prevent the spread of HIV and other STDs, reduce rates of unintended pregnancies, and address other issues important to sexual health. Health advocates can use \"talking points\" from the kit, provide kits for each Tribal Council member, and present the information included in the kit to their Tribal Council. The kit includes information for tribal health advocates and decision\u00admakers regarding: Facts and figures on the importance of addressing sexual health in our communities Tools for assessing community readiness to implement a sexual health program Information on the policy change process and sample policy and resolution templates Case studies of effective models for change in tribal communities Resources to strengthen community sexual health activities and policies Additional information and resources on a USB drive that accompanies each printed kit IHS, OMHRC, and PRT \u00ad\u00adall partners in the creation of the kit \u00ad\u00adwill promote this resource to tribal communities within their networks; however, printed kits can be requested by contacting the IHS HIV/AIDS Program at (301) 443\u00ad4644 or by e\u00admail at lisa.neel@ihs.gov.
