The study, which was published this month in the journal [Vaccine](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13015909), found that breastfed infants had greater responses to OPV compared to those given formula milk. The findings suggests that a simple intervention such as promoting exclusive breastfeeding would help reduce diarrhoea incidences and decrease malnutrition and thus make the oral polio vaccination more effective, and give direction to policy makers to help increase the success rates of such vaccination programmes. Trivalent OPV is known to have low \"per- dose\" efficacy rates in developing countries, with a 21% efficacy in India compared to the estimated 50% in the United States. Similarly, oral rotavirus vaccine was only half as effective in providing infants protection from severe infection. The study's researchers hypothesised that chronic or recurrent inflammation of the gut due to exposure to pathogens (also known as environmental enteropathy), malnutrition and associated immunodeficiency and premature weaning of breast milk affected the ability of some infants' immune systems to respond to oral vaccines, thus suggesting a link between enteric disorders and vaccine failure. This led the researchers to test their hypothesis in a slum in Mirpur, a suburb of Dhaka. The study tested response of OPV in breast-fed infants who were also malnourished and experiencing diarrhoea at the time of vaccination. The infants were enrolled in the study within one week of birth and were followed up until they were a year old. Four hundred thirty five children in the cohort received OPV (any number of doses) with 314 children receiving at least three doses of OPV by 12 months, of whom 258 received 3 doses by 6 months of age. These same infants were tested for serum neutralising antibodies to measure their response to OPV. Duration of breastfeeding was measured as a variable in the level of response to OPV as breastmillk is essential to the development of the infant's immune system and also prevents enteric infections. The researchers also took into account the episodes of diarrhoea within the first 6 months of life and their nutritional status. Scientists from icddr,b's Centre for Vaccine Sciences collaborated with institutions including the University of Virginia, Northwestern University, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, and University of Vermont College of Medicine. The study was funded by National institutes of Health (USA) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. "}
