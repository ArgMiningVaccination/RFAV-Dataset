An Ayurvedic approach treats each individual, taking into account unique psychological, emotional and physical conditions. Because our world and bodies are constantly adjusting to new environments, when these environments become imbalanced we feel it in some way. Ayurvedic healing concentrates on prevention and understanding one's own makeup and focuses on how the outer world and environment affect one's daily life. The goal of Ayurveda is to teach people how to attain optimal health through a deeper understanding of themselves and their own particular nature in relationship to the world around them. It is a system based on natural healing through strengthening the body, mind and spirit and allowing the body's own natural healing mechanisms to work to their fullest potential. In Ayurveda, any condition in which the body is out of balance is considered dis-ease or disease. Therefore, Ayurveda treats a wide range of conditions and looks to do so by determining and affecting the cause, rather that treating the presenting symptoms. Jennifer is a certified Ayurvedic Consultant, having received her Ayurvedic certification from the Kripalu School of Ayurveda in Lenox, Ma. Additionally, Jennifer attended an Advanced Training for Ayurvedic Practitioners at the Jiva Institute in Faridabad, India and has studied with Dr. Vasant Lad at the Ayurvedic Institute in Albuquerque, NM.
