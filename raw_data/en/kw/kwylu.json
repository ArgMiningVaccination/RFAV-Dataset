Remedy K!CK is an all-natural, fruity flavoured energy drink containing no sugar and 80mg of caffeine per can, it packs the same punch as a cup of coffee. Remedy says that with K!CK, it is following a global trend towards cleaner energy options made without sugar or artificial ingredients. Remedy managing director Chris Gillard said as part of R&D, the business looked into the needs of its consumers. \"People are seeking a mental boost without the crash and are looking for something to help them focus at work or while out and about. They don't, however, want the sugar or artificial ingredients that are found in some other energy drinks,\" said Gillard. Remedy K!CK is made using green coffee bean extract for its caffeine hit, and is made with a base of their kombucha. The benefits of their kombucha brew includes live cultures, antioxidants and organic acids.
