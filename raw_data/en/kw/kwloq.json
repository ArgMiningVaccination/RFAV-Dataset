Purpose and Background [[1]](#footnote-1) Congress created the special immigrant juvenile (SIJ) classification when it enacted the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT 90). [[2]](#footnote-2) Certain juveniles in the United States may be eligible for SIJ classification. Once classified as an SIJ, juveniles may be eligible to adjust status, if they meet all eligibility requirements. B.

Eligibility Requirements To adjust to lawful permanent resident (LPR) status as an SIJ, an applicant must meet the eligibility requirements shown in the table below. [[7]](#footnote-7) | | Eligibility Requirement | | Where can I find more information? | | The applicant must have been: | | See Subsection 1, Inspected and Admitted or Inspected and Paroled [ | | The applicant is physically present in the United States at the time of filing and adjudication of an adjustment application. | | See Part A, Adjustment of Status Policies and Procedures [ | | The applicant is eligible to receive an immigrant visa. | | See Subsection 2, Eligibility to Receive an Immigrant Visa [ | | The applicant has an immigrant visa immediately available when he or she files the adjustment of status application and at the time of final adjudication. | | See Part A, Adjustment of Status Policies and Procedures, Chapter 3, Filing Instructions, Section B, Definition of Properly Filed [ | | The applicant is not subject to any applicable bars to adjustment of status. | | See Subsection 3, Bars to Adjustment [ | | The applicant is admissible to the United States or eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility or other form of relief. | | See Subsection 4, Admissibility and Waiver Requirements [ | | The applicant merits the favorable exercise of discretion. | | See Part A, Adjustment of Status Policies and Procedures, Chapter 10, Legal Analysis and Use of Discretion [ 1. Inspected and Admitted or Inspected and Paroled SIJs are not exempt from the general adjustment requirement that applicants be inspected and admitted or inspected and paroled. [[8]](#footnote-8) However, the INA expressly states that SIJs are considered paroled into the United States for purposes of adjustment under [INA 245(a)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title8-section1255&num=0&edition=prelim). Accordingly, the beneficiary of an approved SIJ petition is treated for purposes of the adjustment application as if the beneficiary has been paroled, regardless of the beneficiary's manner of arrival in the United States. [[9]](#footnote-9) 2. Eligibility to Receive an Immigrant Visa [[10]](#footnote-10) An applicant must be eligible to receive an immigrant visa to adjust status. [[11]](#footnote-11) An adjustment applicant typically establishes eligibility for an immigrant visa through an approved immigrant petition. An SIJ can establish eligibility for an immigrant visa by obtaining classification from USCIS by filing an SIJ-based Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant ( [Form I-360](/i-360)) (SIJ petition). [[12]](#footnote-12) Therefore, in order for an SIJ-based adjustment applicant to be eligible to receive an immigrant visa, he or she must be one of the following: - The applicant is the beneficiary of an approved Petition for Amerasian, Widow(er), or Special Immigrant ( [Form I-360](/i-360)) classifying him or her as an SIJ; - The applicant has a pending [Form I-360](/i-360)(that is ultimately approved); or - The applicant is filing the adjustment application concurrently with the Form I-360 (and the [Form I-360](/i-360)is ultimately approved). Verifying the Underlying Basis to Adjust Status and Determining Ongoing Eligibility [[13]](#footnote-13) The SIJ petition should already be adjudicated and approved when the officer adjudicates the adjustment application. USCIS does not re-adjudicate the SIJ petition at the time of the adjudication of the adjustment application. However, the officer should ensure that the applicant remains classified as an SIJ and thus is eligible to adjust as an SIJ. As a result, there may be instances when USCIS may require the applicant to provide additional evidence to show he or she continues to be classified as an SIJ. In other words, the officer must verify the status of any underlying immigrant petition that forms the basis for adjustment. Revocation of Approved Petition USCIS may revoke an approved SIJ petition upon notice as necessary [[14]](#footnote-14) for what it deems to be good and sufficient cause, [[15]](#footnote-15) such as, if the record contains evidence or information that materially conflicts with the evidence or information that was the basis for petitioner's eligibility for SIJ classification. USCIS issues a Notice of Intent to Revoke (NOIR) and provides the petitioner an opportunity to offer evidence in support of the petition and in opposition to the grounds alleged for revocation of the approved petition. [[16]](#footnote-16) Furthermore, USCIS automatically revokes an approved SIJ petition, [[17]](#footnote-17) as of the date of approval, if any one of the circumstances below occurs before a decision on the adjustment application is issued: - Reunification of the petitioner with one or both parents by virtue of a juvenile court order, [[18]](#footnote-18)where a juvenile court previously deemed reunification with that parent, or both parents, not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis under state law; [[19]](#footnote-19)or - Reversal by the juvenile court of the determination that it would not be in the petitioner's best interest to be returned (to a placement) to the petitioner's or the petitioner's parent's country of nationality or last habitual residence. [[20]](#footnote-20) If one of the above grounds for automatic revocation occurs, USCIS issues a notice to the petitioner of such revocation of the SIJ petition, which means the applicant is no longer classified as a SIJ. [[21]](#footnote-21) If the petition is revoked, either upon notice or as an automatic revocation, [[22]](#footnote-22) then the officer should deny the adjustment application because the applicant no longer has an underlying basis to adjust status. 3. Bars to Adjustment [[23]](#footnote-23) An applicant classified as an SIJ is barred from adjustment if deportable due to engagement in terrorist activity or association with terrorist organizations. [[24]](#footnote-24) There is no waiver of or exemption to this adjustment bar if it applies. Therefore, if the terrorist-related bar to adjustment applies, an SIJ is ineligible for adjustment of status. 4. Admissibility and Waiver Requirements [[25]](#footnote-25) In general, an applicant who is inadmissible to the United States may only obtain LPR status if he or she obtains a waiver or other form of relief, if available. [[26]](#footnote-26) In general, if a ground of inadmissibility applies, an applicant must apply for a waiver or other form of relief to overcome an inadmissibility ground that applies. [[27]](#footnote-27) USCIS may approve the application to adjust status if a waiver or other form of relief is granted and the applicant is otherwise eligible. The following table specifies which grounds of inadmissibility do not apply to applicants seeking LPR status based on the SIJ classification. [[28]](#footnote-28) | | Inadmissibility Grounds that Do Not Apply to Special Immigrant Juveniles | | Public Charge | | Labor Certification | | Present without admission or parole | | Misrepresentation | | Stowaways | | Documentation Requirements for Immigrants | | Unlawful Presence The following table specifies which grounds of inadmissibility do apply to applicants seeking LPR status based on the SIJ classification and for which a waiver or other form of relief may be available. | | Inadmissibility Grounds that Apply to Special Immigrant Juveniles | | Health-Related | | Crime-Related | | Security-Related | | Failure to Attend Removal Proceedings | | Smugglers | | Subject of Civil Penalty | | Student Visa Abusers | | Ineligibility for Citizenship | | Certain Aliens Previously Removed | | Aliens Unlawfully Present After Previous Immigration Violations | | Practicing Polygamists, Guardians Required to Accompany Helpless Persons, International Child Abductors, Unlawful Voters, and Former Citizens who Renounced Citizenship to Avoid Taxation An applicant found inadmissible based on any of the above applicable grounds may be eligible for an SIJ-specific waiver of these inadmissibility grounds for: - Humanitarian purposes; - Family unity; or - When it is otherwise in the public interest. [[29]](#footnote-29) The following table specifies which grounds of inadmissibility cannot be waived under the SIJ-specific waiver for such purposes. [[30]](#footnote-30) | | Inadmissibility Grounds that Cannot Be Waived | | Conviction of Certain Crimes | | Multiple Criminal Convictions | | Controlled Substance Traffickers | | Security and Related Grounds | | Terrorist Activities | | Foreign Policy Related | | Participants in Nazi Persecution, Genocide, or the Commission of Any Act of Torture or Extrajudicial Killing Juvenile Delinquency Findings of juvenile delinquency are not considered criminal convictions for purposes of immigration law. However, certain grounds of inadmissibility do not require a conviction. In some cases, certain conduct alone may be sufficient to trigger an inadmissibility ground. [[32]](#footnote-32) Furthermore, findings of juvenile delinquency may also be part of a discretionary analysis. [[33]](#footnote-33) USCIS will consider findings of juvenile delinquency on a case-by-case basis based on the totality of the evidence to determine whether a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted. Therefore, an adjustment applicant must disclose all arrests and charges. If any arrest or charge was disposed of as a matter of juvenile delinquency, the applicant must include the court or other public record that establishes this disposition. In the event that an applicant is unable to provide such records because the applicant's case was expunged or sealed, the applicant must provide information about the arrest and evidence demonstrating that such records are unavailable under the law of the particular jurisdiction. USCIS evaluates sealed and expunged records according to the nature and severity of the criminal offense. 5. Treatment of Family Members Dependents of SIJs cannot file as derivative applicants. SIJ beneficiaries may petition for certain qualifying family members through family-based immigration after they have adjusted status to LPR. [[34]](#footnote-34) However, a juvenile who adjusts status based on an SIJ classification may not confer an immigration benefit to their natural or prior adoptive parents after naturalization. [[35]](#footnote-35) This prohibition also applies to a non-abusive, custodial parent, if one exists. D. Documentation and Evidence An applicant should submit the following documentation to adjust status as an SIJ: [[36]](#footnote-36) - Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status ( [Form I-485](/i-485)), with the correct fee or with a Request for Fee Waiver ( [Form I-912](/i-912)); - Copy of the receipt or approval notice (Form I-797) for the applicant's SIJ petition (unless the applicant is filing the petition together with [Form I-485](/i-485)); [[37]](#footnote-37) - Two passport-style photographs; - Copy of government-issued identity document with photograph (if available); - Copy of birth certificate or other evidence of birth; - Copy of passport page with nonimmigrant visa (if applicable); - Copy of passport page with admission or parole stamp (if applicable); - Copy of Arrival/Departure Record (Form I-94) or copy of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) admission or parole stamp on the travel document (if applicable); [[38]](#footnote-38) - Report of Immigration Medical Examination and Vaccination Record ( [Form I-693](/i-693)); [[39]](#footnote-39) - Certified police and court records of juvenile delinquency findings, criminal charges, arrests, or convictions (if applicable); - Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility ( [Form I-601](/i-601)) or other form of relief (if applicable); and - Documentation of past or present J-1 or J-2 nonimmigrant status, including proof of compliance with or waiver of the 2-year foreign residence requirement under [INA 212(e)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title8-section1182&num=0&edition=prelim)(if applicable). [[40]](#footnote-40) E. Adjudication [[41]](#footnote-41) 1. Filing An applicant seeking adjustment of status as a special immigrant juvenile may file his or her adjustment application with USCIS concurrently with the SIJ petition, while the SIJ petition is pending, or after USCIS approves the SIJ petition (as long as the petition is still valid), provided: - USCIS has jurisdiction over the adjustment application; [[42]](#footnote-42)and - The visa availability requirements are met. [[43]](#footnote-43) 2. Interview Determining Necessity of Interview USCIS recognizes the vulnerable nature of SIJ based applicants for adjustment of status and generally conducts interviews of SIJ based applicants for adjustment of status when an interview is deemed necessary. USCIS conducts a full review of the record and supporting evidence to determine whether an interview may be warranted. USCIS will generally not require an interview if the record contains sufficient information and evidence to approve the adjustment application without an in-person assessment. However, USCIS retains the discretion to interview SIJ based adjustment applicants for the purposes of adjudicating the adjustment of status application, as applicable. [[44]](#footnote-44) Conducting the Interview Given the vulnerable nature of SIJ based adjustment applicants and the hardships they may face because of the loss of parental support, USCIS takes special care to establish a child-friendly interview environment. During an interview, USCIS avoids questioning the applicant about the details of the abuse, neglect, or abandonment suffered because these issues are handled by the juvenile court. USCIS generally focuses the interview on resolving issues related to eligibility for adjustment of status. The applicant may bring a trusted adult to the interview in addition to an attorney or representative. The trusted adult may serve as a familiar source of comfort to the applicant, but should not interfere with the interview process or coach the applicant during the interview. Given potential human trafficking and other concerns, USCIS assesses the appropriateness of the adult to attend the interview and is observant of the adult's interaction with the child. If USCIS has any concerns related to appropriateness of the adult's presence, USCIS may continue the interview without that adult present. Although USCIS may limit the number of persons present at the interview, such limitations do not extend to the petitioner's attorney or accredited representative of record. [[45]](#footnote-45) 3. Age-Out Protections There is no age limit for SIJ-based applicants for adjustment of status. In cases where an SIJ petitioner is under 21 years of age on the date of proper filing of the SIJ petition, USCIS does not deny an SIJ-based adjustment application solely because the applicant is older than 21 years of age at the time of filing or adjudication of [Form I-485](/i-485). [[46]](#footnote-46) 4. Decision Approval The officer must determine that the applicant meets all the eligibility requirements and merits the favorable exercise of discretion [[47]](#footnote-47) before approving the application to adjust status as an SIJ. If the application for adjustment of status is approvable, the officer must determine if a visa is available at the time of final adjudication. [[48]](#footnote-48) If approved, USCIS assigns the following code of admission to applicants adjusting under this category: | | Applicant | | Code of Admission | | Special Immigrant Juvenile | | SL6 The applicant becomes an LPR as of the date of approval of the adjustment application. [[49]](#footnote-49) Denial If the officer determines that the applicant is ineligible for adjustment, the officer must deny the adjustment application. The officer must provide the applicant a written reason for the denial. [[50]](#footnote-50) Although there are no appeal rights for the denial of an adjustment application, the applicant may file a motion to reopen or reconsider, or renew the application in Immigration Court. The denial notice should include instructions for filing a Notice of Appeal or Motion ( [Form I-290B](/i-290b)).
