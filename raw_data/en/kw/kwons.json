To learn more about crystals and what they do check out our Healing Crystals Guide What is Crystals Healing? The spiritual world is filled with crystal talk. Much of what we find is derived from ancient findings from native peoples who worshipped their gods and ancestors alongside these magical spirit helpers. Healing stones and crystals really do pertain to all crystals and all healing crystal jewelry, however, there are really some crystals that are far more powerful healers than others. Each crystal has a set of attributes and energies that we can work with. Even though scientists have called this crystal work a pseudoscience, the proof is in the millions of energy healers who swear by their crystal energies in therapies. The best healing crystals for sale in our [ metaphysical supply store ](https://crystal-shop.co/metaphysical-supply-store/) are listed below: - Rose Quartz - Citrine - Moldavite - Clear Quartz - Black Onyx - Amethyst - Moonstone - Turquoise - Selenite - Lapis Lazuli - Black Tourmaline Each one of the crystal healing stones listed above provides a different approach in the vast landscape of energetic healing. It is essential that you consult a trusted [healing crystal list](https://www.crystal-shop.co/rose-quartz-meaning-3/) and decide for yourself which of the crystals best suits your needs. And once you have found the best healing crystals for you, then it would be wise to find a suitable [healing crystal shop](https://www.crystal-shop.co/shop/) where you can purchase them Crystal Shop at an affordable price with excellent quality. Gemstones and Their Uses Regardless of the ailment befalling you, there is a healing crystals helper that can assist you on your path to [transformative healing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxPEj4aU1rUDnPbfX8SaMog). There are a thousand ways to look at pseudosciences, and many of the new age practitioners, as well as the scientists claiming falsehoods, have not yet experienced the inner sanctum of magic contained in the very earth around us. The mind is an enigma to the very top scientists of today. The mind, not located only in the brain as many people have thought, allows us to draw on the magic of whatever we perceive to be magical. With things such as crystal healing stones, we already have innate energetic frequencies that are present and therefore make spiritual, physical, and mental healing so much easier. The magical arts were never taught to those who could not conceive of something beyond the physical world. Until the student understood these finite truths of the spiritual realms, they would be left in their own delusions of a solid reality. Science has caught up, and since the discovery of the atom, we have begun opening scientists' minds to the fact that something more significant than this solid-seeming life is possible. Quantum physics is allowing the foundation for newer theories to have a grounding. In all these new areas of exploration, we believe that they will sooner than later admit to the energy vibration effect on human beings. Until that time, we need to work with the crystals, the plants, and other pseudosciences such as global healing modalities from Mikao Usui's [Reiki](https://www.crystal-shop.co/product/reiki-stones/). When choosing your crystals, the types of healing crystals that you want is really up to you and your desires right now. Remember that \"the only constant in life is change - Heraclitus.\" This means that your crystal uses will change, the way that you incorporate healing crystals and their meanings into your life now will change and evolve over time. The best healing crystals for sale for you now will change as you begin to heal and work with the energies of the healing crystals more and more. Authentic Crystals and Real Gemstone Shop Throughout the ages, we have learned from our ancestors and forbears to worship the land, and all that mother earth provides us with. Through the ages, we have also built our skyscrapers over her soil, tarring the pathways through the mountains and blasting the caverns in search of gold and diamonds. There are spaces left where we can return to hear the song of the earth mother, but sometimes we cannot venture into these places, and instead, many of the spiritual folk who have the understanding and the calling of the earth mother have chosen to turn their homes into sacred places. Healing crystals provide us with the ability to bring mother nature's teachings and energy into our homes and into our hearts. Remember, the journey of the crystal is as far as your own inward journey for healing will be. The crystal that you choose when searching where to buy healing crystals has traveled from is nesting place deep within the earth, it has been transported across thousands of miles sometimes, and then it has been polished and created into art to give you the most beautiful part of it. Every crystal in our crystal shop originated somewhere, and with this crystal, you are bringing the energy and the vibration of that part of the earth with healing crystals into your home and into your life. Mother earth is a powerful healer. Every one of the healing crystal stones contains her essence, and regardless of how big or small the crystal that you are holding, it has the essence of mother earth. It is this essence, this piece of healing magic that you are tapping into and connecting with when you choose to step onto the spiritual journey of healing stones and crystals. Even your healing crystal jewelry has been lovingly crafted into a piece of magic for you to adorn yourself with and for you to call on when you need the attributes of the crystal that you have charged it with no matter its Ear cuff or any other piece of Jewelry. The question of 'real healing crystals' falls upon the logical mind and the ego. We only find that the rational mind is asking these questions about whether or not a pseudoscience truly works or not. The heart understands, and so does intuition. The logical mind cannot understand something that it feels and does not see as a solid part of the matter in front of it. The crystals for emotional healing do not work by appeasing the logical mind; they work through the heart chakra and the energetic frequencies of love and healing filter through the spiritual bodies and the physical body [chakra stones](https://crystal-shop.co/product/chakra-stones/) to infuse you with a vibrational lift and a necessary change for crystal healing to occur. How to Choose Your Healing Crystals For Sale It is said that the crystal will come to you. Whether you are gifted the crystal or whether you make the decision to buy healing crystals for yourself, the results will not differ. The myth that a crystal must be given to you is nonsense. Yes, gifting someone a crystal is one of the best gifts that money can buy and will have a life-changing effect on them, and receiving a present of healing crystals is genuinely a magical occurrence, but this is not a necessity. The healing power and the energetic assistance from the crystal kingdom are there for you to make use of. You do not need anyone to make this decision for you, only you. This is your life that you are choosing to heal, and it is your life that you are choosing to place on a spiritual path of transformation and healing. The crystal kingdom does not require human influence for its effects to work. It basically boils down to assessing your life as it stands now. What is lacking in your life? What do you want to change? Are there parts of your life that you would like to enhance? Do you need more courage? Which healing crystals are the best? Do you long for that special someone in your life? Are you suffering from night terrors and need some assistance in getting a good night's sleep? Do you suffer from specific ailments and require a helping hand to find yourself on the road to healing? All these are introspective questions that you need to ask before you choose your healing crystals. Once you have completed asking all the necessary questions and can safely put together a healing crystals list that you require for certain areas of your life, it is time to make the purchase. What Happens Once You Have Received Your Healing Crystals? Once you have received your crystal healing stones, it is essential to run them under cold water. Try not to run selenite under cold water for too long. If you have sage or cedar incense on hand, light some and pass your newly acquired energetic assistance through the cleansing and awakening smoke. When you pass them through this incense smoke, repeat the following, \"Element of Air, I ask thee to purify my ____(name your crystal)___ and awaken in it the ____(name the attribute of the crystal that you wish to connect with.) Once you have passed it through the water, through the incense, it is time to spend time with your healing crystals. Many practitioners choose to include a dream diary during this process. Keep a book and pencil or pen next to your bed and sleep with your crystals under your pillow for five or nine nights at least, or until you feel that you are ready to wear your healing crystal jewelry or carry your healing crystals with you. The importance of recording your dreams allows for insights from your soul to filter through and speak to you. We do not always have access to this information in our waking state because of the hustle and bustle, the various roles and responsibilities that normal life clouds our soul's voice, and our dreamwork thus become exceptionally important to connect with our higher self and our innate wisdom.

How many of these human experiences we have we do not know yet, however, this vessel, this body, this temple that you inhabit benefits immensely from the energies that it is surrounded by. It is also greatly affected by the people that you choose to surround yourself with and the music that you want to listen to. Everything, including the healing crystals and [jade roller](https://crystal-shop.co/jade-roller/) that you bring into your life, will change you; make sure that you ask for exactly what it is that you want, and you will receive it.
