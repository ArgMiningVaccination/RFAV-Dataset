The Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2013 (VMR) , as they apply in Great Britain (GB) , set out the controls on the marketing, manufacture, supply, possession and administration of veterinary medicines and medicated feed in GB. These controls are required to protect the safety of animals, people handling the medicines, consumers of produce from treated animals and the environment. 2. The last major update to the VMR was in 2013 . We want to modernise the VMR in order to make them more effective and for the regulatory regime to reflect advances and developments in the veterinary medicines sector , to continue to allow for safe, fair and competitive markets. Engagement with industry has identified that certain provisions in the VMR are not clear, which can result in non-compliance. This also causes cos ts for stakeholders trying to understand the requirements under the VMR and achieve compliance . In addition, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) is facing increased costs for providing its regulatory services . Those costs can no longer be fully reco vered under the fees set by the current VMR. 3. The proposed changes are intended to remove outdated and unnecessary regulatory burden ; reflect developments and technical advances in the veterinary medicines sector ; encourage the submission and marketing of new and innovative products to support the aim of increasing availability of medicines ; reduce development and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR); improve prescription and supply of veterinary medicines; increase transparency to reduce unnecessary cost for industry and increase compliance; and enable full cost recovery for the regulatory services the VMD provides. Describe the policy options considered 4. The options considered are to do nothing (Option 0), implement proposed changes to fees only (Option 1), or implement all proposed changes to the VMR (Option 2). 5. Implementing all proposed changes (Option 2) is the preferred option. Th is would allow for the VMD to achieve full cost recovery, as well as modernise the VMR, make them more effective and maintain the UK as an attractive place to develop and market veterinary medicines . The changes would remove unnecessary regulatory burden where possible and introduce further measures to help tackle antimicrobial resistance . 6. Veterinary medicines , like human medicines, are highly regulated goods and the proposed changes are necessary to continue to protect animal health, public health and the environment, including in regard to the food chain and AMR where stringent requirements are necessary. We are not proposing to add disproportionate or unnecessary burden where voluntary or industry-led initiatives have successfully improved standards. Rationale for DMA rating 7. The total expected annual net direct cost to business is \u00a393,000, based on a cost of \u00a3998,000 and savings of \u00a3905,000. 8. The estimates in this pre -consultation assessment are based on our initial assessments. Where we have been unable to provide quantifiable costs, we have provided a qualitative analysis. We will use the public consultation on the proposed changes to the VMR to address evidence gaps and provide an updated assessment. Will the policy be reviewed?

The Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2013 ( VMR) set out the controls on the authorisation, manufacture, supply, possession and administration of veterinary medicines and medicated feed.1 These controls are required to protect the safety of animals, people handling the medicines, consumers of produce from treated animals and the environment. 10. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) is the regulatory and policy lead body responsible for issues concerning the use and manufacture of veterinary med icines and medicated feed in the United Kingdom ( UK). Veterinary medicines are a reserved matter in England, Scotland and Wales but certain aspects are devolved to Northern Ireland (NI) under the UK's devolution settlements. 11. The proposed changes to the VM R covered in this pre-consultation De Minimis Assessment (DMA) are strictly concerned with the veterinary medicines sector in Great Britain (GB). As a result of the effect of the Northern Ireland Protocol ('the Protocol'), the legislation relating to veter inary medicines in Northern Ireland ( NI) is separate to that for GB. 12. The government is clear that the Protocol, in its current form, is not delivering on its core objectives and is seeking a new, consensual approach to implementing the Protocol, that ensures it operates in an enduring way. 13. The rules on veterinary medicines in N I are currently subject to a UK -EU agreed 'grace period', which expires on 31 December 2025. The UK government is seeking a long -term solution that safeguards the availability of veterinary medicines in N I. We would prefer to agree a negotiated outcome with the EU but if that is not possible then the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, introduced to Parliament in June 2022, will be used to provide long - term certainty for industry. Onc e there is a long-term solution on the availability of veterinary medicines in NI, we will look to update the VMR as they have effect in NI accordingly. 14. The last major update to the VMR was in 2013 (apart from minor amendments in 2014 and after EU Exit).2 Since then, the VMD has considered a number of changes to the VMR, to modernise them, make them more effective, reduce regulatory burden on industry where possible, and maintain the UK as an attractive place to develop and market veterinary medicines. 15. The VMD has discussed the upcoming revision to the VMR with industry bodies and veterinary professionals; many of their proposals are included in the proposed changes to the VMR. The VMD has also considered changes that have been or will be int roduced to regulatory regimes in countries with equivalent regulatory standards for veterinary medicines. 16. The market for authorised veterinary medicines is worth an estimated \u00a37 38m in annual UK sales.3 Problem under consideration 17. We want to modernise the VMR in order to make them more effective and for the regulatory regime to reflect advances and developments in the veterinary medicines sector, to continue to allow for safe, fair and competitive markets. An up-to-date regime would, for example, enable pharmaceutical companies to save costs on labelling , 4 incentivise innovative products being brought to the market, and allow prescribers to make efficient use of their time through remote prescribing , where appropriate. 18. The veterinary pharmaceutical industry is largely set up to service the region of Europe, including the UK. New legislation for veterinary medicines and medicated feed appl ies in the EU since January 2022. This means that these companies now have to comply with different regulatory frameworks. Whilst still a member of the EU, t he UK negotiated and supported many of the changes in EU legislation, with the aim to reduce regulatory burden. Therefore, we propose to make corresponding provisions in the VMR where we agree from a UK policy perspective but to deviate where it is beneficial to the UK. 19. Businesses regulated by the VMR have indicated that certain provisions are not clear, which could result in non-compliance. This also may cause costs for stakeholders trying to understand the requirements under the VMR and achieve compliance. The lack of clarity comes from terms used within the VMR that have no legal definition , inconsistent wording for areas that expect the same (or similar) requirements , and from specific requirements, such as for prescriptions, not being clearly stated. This c ould also lead to unfair advantages being given to businesses who interpret the VMR in ways that result in the inappropriate or irresponsible supply or use of veterinary medicines. 20. The VMR contain some requirements that are no longer needed or justified and cause unnecessary regulatory burden for our stakeholders. This includes for example the need for renewals of marketing authorisations , or adverse event reporting by retailers, usually smaller businesses , for veterinary medicines marketed under the small pet animal exemption. 21. In addition, the VMD faces increased costs for providing its regulatory services due to increased charging rates and overheads. Our costs have also increased as we are no longer part of the EU regulatory network. This means , for example, that we cannot share assessment workloads with other regulators. Our costs have risen despite the VMD putting in place cost saving measures, such as carrying out remote inspections w here appropriate. The costs can no longer be fully recovered under the fees set in the current VMR. Rationale for intervention 22. The proposed changes will modernise the VMR and make them more effective. They will help ensure that high quality, safe and effec tive veterinary medicines continue to be available. 23. Veterinary medicines , like human medicines, are highly regulated goods because of their effect on animals, as well as potential negative impacts on humans (including via the food chain) and the environme nt. The VMR help protect the food chain by ensuring veterinary medicines are not present at unsafe levels in the food we eat. Poor-quality or unsafe medicines can pose a risk to animal health , and inappropriate and irresponsible use of medicines can reduce their effectiveness, for example through the development of resistance to the active substance . This means non -regulatory options are not always a viable option. 24. The VMD has worked with industry to establish non -regulatory alternatives where possible. For example, we have collaborated with other government bodies, farmers and the veterinary profession to half antibiotic use in livestock over recent years, and the UK is now one of the lowest users of veterinary antibiotics in Europe. This achievement has been based on improving best practice and reducing unnecessary use and has been driven by the livestock sectors themselves. The measures we will implement in legislation will further support these principles and the sustainability of responsible use of ve terinary antibiotics in this country. We have also established earned recognition schemes with industry auditors for manufacturers of medicated feedingstuffs to encourage high standards and increase inspection intervals for compliant companies. 5 25. The VMD is required to recover fees and charges its costs for the regulatory services it provides, according to the principles laid down in HM Treasury's 'Managing Public Money'.4 As the VMD is facing increased costs, the current fees no longer allow the VMD to fully recover its costs for those services. Policy objective 26. The proposed changes are intended to modernise the VMR and make them more effective. They will remove outdated or unnecessary regulatory burden ; reflect developments and technical advances in the vet erinary medicines sector; encourage the submission and marketing of new and innovative products to support the aim of increasing availability of medicines; reduce development and spread of AMR; and improve prescription and supply of veterinary medicines . They will ensure that appropriate regulation is in place to protect animal health, public health and the environment. They will also increase transparency to reduce unnecessary cost for industry and increase compliance . 27. Schedule 7 to the VMR, which sets th e fees for the regulatory services provided by the VMD, will be amended to allow the VMD to achieve full cost recovery for those services. The changes proposed to fee structures will improve transparency and consistency. Options considered Non-regulatory options 28. Veterinary medicines, like human medicines, are highly regulated goods because of their effect on animals, as well as potential negative impacts on humans (including via the food chain) and the environment. The VMR help assure authorised v eterinary medicin es are of high quality, safe and efficacious to avoid risk to animal health, public health and the environment. The VMD has sought non -regulatory options, such as supporting industry bodies in creating voluntary schemes to use anti biotics responsibly, or to maintain high standards for feedingstuffs manufacturers. 5 Non-regulatory approaches are not always an option where risks can result in severe consequences. Option 0 - Do Nothing 29. Continue with the VMR as they currently apply in GB. This is the baseline against which the other options are measured. Option 1 - Implement proposed changes to fees only 30. Make changes to the existing fees and fee structure in the VMR. The changes include amending fee structures to make them more transparent, removing redundant f ees and amending or adding appropriate fees to ensure the costs of all regulatory services provided by the VMD are recovered. 31. Fee changes are not covered by this assessment under the statutory exemptions for the Better Regulations Framework.6 We have included this option in the assessment as a comparison for the impact on other costs. Option 2 - Implement all proposed changes to the VMR (preferred option) 32. Implement all proposed changes to the VMR . The VMD proposes to make around 200 changes to the VMR (see Annex A for a list of changes). 33. This includes clarification of existing provisions, adjusting or introducing new requirements, removing unnecessary requirements and making changes to the fees. 4 HM Treasury, Managing Public Money, publishing.service.gov.uk , 2022. 5 Veterinary Medicines Directorate, Multi-sectoral Collaboration Contributed to Halving the Sale of Antib iotics in the UK Livestock Industry, gov.uk, 2022. 6 Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy , The Better Regulation Framework, publishing.service.gov.uk , 2020. 6 2.0 Rationale for De Minimis Rating 34. The total expected annual net direct cost to business is \u00a3 93,000, based on a cost of \u00a3998,000 and savings of \u00a3905,000. 35. The changes are not expected to result in significant impacts between sectors or result in significant gross impacts. The majority of businesses in th e veterinary medicines sector are small or micro businesses ; the changes have been proposed with consideration given to smaller businesses and there should be no disproportionate burdens for smaller businesses. 36. These changes are not expected to have signif icant wider impacts, although they will provide some unquantifiable benefits to society and help protect the environment. 37. There are no changes with novel or contentious elements that have been proposed. 3.0 Costs and Benefits Option 0 - Do nothing 38. This is the baseline for all other options. 39. Continue with the VMR as they currently apply in GB. This means maintaining the existing regulations which are no longer fully reflecting the (international) advances and developments in the veterinary medicines sector and do not address the government's intention to strengthen national legislation to support the government's commitment to reducing unnecessary use of antibiotics in animals. This would also mean the VMD can no longer fully recover its costs for the regu latory services it provides. 40. This would result in tw o significantly different regulatory frameworks in place in GB and Northern Ireland (EU), where closer mirroring is preferred by the pharmaceutical industry , who are set up to service the region of Europe , including the UK . If we continue with the current VMR, the pharmaceutical industry faces additional burdens in meeting different legislative requirements. Option 1 - Implement proposed changes to fees only 41. Make changes to the existing fees and fee structure in the VMR. This would allow full cost recovery for the VMD's regulatory services by making changes to reflect the cost of the services provided by the VMD. The changes include amending fee structures to make them more transparent, removing redundant fees and amending or adding appropriate fees to ensure the costs of all regulatory services are recovered. 42. This option does not address the is sues identified with the current regulations and it would not address the government's intention to strengthen national legislation to support the government's commitment to reducing unnecessary use of antibiotics in animals . 43. This would again result in tw o significantly different regulatory frameworks in place in GB and NI (EU), where closer mirroring is preferred by the pharmaceutical industry , who are set up to service the region of Europe , including the UK . If we continue with the current VMR, the pharmaceutical industry faces additional burdens in meeting different legislative requirements. 44. Fee changes are not covered by this assessment under the statutory exemptions for the Better Regulations Framework.7 We have included this option in the assess ment as a comparison for the impact on other costs. Option 2 - Implement all proposed changes to the VMR (preferred) 45. Implement all proposed changes to modernise the VMR and ensure the VMR continue to be fit-for-purpose, allowing the effective regulation of the veterinary medicines sector. 7 Ibid. 7 46. The changes proposed under option 2 will ensure the VMR continue to protect animal health, human health and the environment, enabling the continued supply of medicines to GB and contributing to achieving the UK 20 -year vision for antimicrobial resistance.8 47. This option would allow full cost recovery for the VMD's regulatory services by making changes to reflect the cost of the regulatory services provided by the VMD. 48. It would also reduce regulatory burden to the industry, where possible. 4.0 Summary of Costs and Benefits 49. The estimates in this pre -consultation assessment are based on our initial assessments. Where we have been unable to provide quantifiable costs, we have provided a qualitative analysis. We will us e the public consultation on the proposed changes to the VMR to address the evidence gaps and provide an updated assessment. All changes discussed in this document are the subject of public consultation and are therefore subject to change . 50. For regulatory changes, we have considered the expected additional costs and likely savings to the different parts of the veterinary medicines sector (including the supply chain) which will be affected in different ways. Included in these estimates are the familiarisation costs and the costs for compliance with the VMR, which for example can include collating information and dealing with queries from the VMD. An overview of our estimated figures is included in Table 1 (below). Table 1 - The expected annual net direct cost to business of regulatory changes on different sectors (includes familiarisation costs) Type of Business/Area Sector size Costs (\u00a3) Savings Overall (\u00a3) 0 +2,966 Veterinary practices 2,245 402,228 +83,982 675 17,141 365,700 -348,559 Feed business operators 16,787 0 +16,787 Total 96,236 998,031 904,958 +93,073 51. For the quantified cost estimates, t he sector sizes have been calculated based on the number of premises authorised under the VMR, number of veterinary practices registered with the RCVS and the number of farmers according to Statista.9 Wage estimates are based on the Office for National St atistics Annual Survey for Hours and Earnings 2021, 8 HM Government, Contained and controlled: the UK's 20 -year vision for antimicrobial resistance, publishing.service.gov.uk , 2019. 9 D. Clarke, Farmers in the UK 2022, Statista.com, 2022. 8 calculated with an uplift of 22% for non -wage costs as recommended by the Regulatory Policy Committee.10 52. It has not been possible to quantify all expected impacts of the proposed changes to the VMR due to a lack of data and information, for example where there are no published studies or reasonable equivalents to calculate the impacts , or where it is not possible to put a monetary value on the impact . Where we have not been able to quantify impacts, we have carried out a qualitative analysis to outline the expected areas that will be directly and indirectly impacted, as well as any wider impacts, such as protection of the environment or increased acces s to veterinary medicines . This is discussed in further detail in the specific costs and benefits sections below. 53. We will hold a formal public consultation on the proposed changes to the VMR to gain the views of interested parties on the proposals. As part of this consultation, we will test our assumptions and gather more evidence of the impacts of the changes we are proposing. General changes and familiarisation costs 54. General changes will increase clarity and transparency of the VMR by pr oviding specific definitions and explicitly stating the intention of requirements, which will increase compliance, maintain high standards and ensure the requirements for the veterinary pharmaceutical industry and veterinary professionals are consistent an d fair. The majority of the proposed changes fall under this category. 55. This will include: confirming the requirements for veterinary medicines in GB clarifying or reiterating the requirements under the VMR clarifying the Secretary of State's powers where n on-compliance is identified providing definitions for words and terms used within the VMR 56. All sectors will have familiarisation costs from interpreting the changes and understanding the impacts on their sector; we estimate the total cost for familiarisatio n will be \u00a3528,512. 57. These costs are based on the average earnings for the responsible officer in each sector and the time taken to familiarise with the relevant changes for that sector based on the Business Impact Target for Appraisal of Guidance multiplie d by the number of premises. This guidance indicates that 50 -100 technical words can be read per minute, and that only 50% of industry will read the guidance.11 For industry and veterinary professionals, we have increased this to expect 65% to familiarise themselves with the changes. We have also added a 22% uplift to include non -wage costs as recommended by the Regulatory Policy Committee.12 58. Table 2 shows a summary of these costs across industry sectors, a more detailed breakdown of these costs is availabl e in Annex B. 10 Office for National Statistics, Employee earnings in the UK, ons.gov.uk , 2021, and Regulatory Policy Committee, Short guidance note_- _Implementation costs, publishing.service.gov.uk , 2019. 11 Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy , Business Impact Target: app raisal of guidance - assessments for regulator -issued guidance, publishing.service.gov.uk , 2017. 12 Regulatory Policy Committee, Short guidance note_-_Implementation costs, publishing.service.gov.uk , 2019. 9 Table 2 - The expected familiarisation costs for the different sectors Sector Sector size Familiarisation cost for the sector (\u00a3) Marketing authorisation holders 187 18,402 Manufacturers 123 6,643 Wholesale dealers 135 2,966 Veterinary practices 2,245 55,887 Veterinary pharmacists 10 117 SQP retailers 675 8,694 Feed business operators 761 16,787 Professional keepers of animals 92,100 371,070 Total 96,236 480,566 Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) 59. We propose tighter requirements for anti biotic veterinary medicines throughout the VMR, which we expect to result in further safeguards to tackle AMR, protecting public health and animal health. Every year, 1.27 million global deaths are attributed to AMR, wi th a further 4.95 million associated deaths.13 There is also a cumulative global cost of $100 trillion by 2050 if no action is taken.14 In the UK, an estimated 12,000 people die each year from infections caused by resistant bacteria.15 AMR requires a One Health approach, requiring a combined effort from human, animal and environmental sectors to tackle it. 60. When applying for a marketing authorisation (M A), the applicant will be required to submit data on the AMR risks associated with the medicine to animal health, public health and the environment, and the mitigations put in place to limit AMR development, which will help ensure the effica cy and safety of these products in future. We will ask for evidence of any costs in relation to these changes to the pharmaceutical industry in the public consultation. 61. We propose new provisions to allow the VMD to refuse M A applications if they include a n antibiotic that is critical for human use, that is intended to be used as a performance enhancer or growth promotor, or if there is an unmitigated or unjustified risk of AMR development. The familiarisation costs for these changes are covered under the marketing authorisation holders' familiarisation costs. 62. The proposed changes will also prevent the routine prescribing of antibiotics for group prophylactic use and set a 5 -day maximum validity for prescriptions for antibiotics. 63. A proposed provision would make it possible for the Secretary of State to require provision of usage data of antibiotics. The VMD has worked in partnership with food - producing animal sectors to develop, facilitate and coordinate antibiotic usage data collection systems on a voluntary basis. This provision w ould only be used where necessary and where data is not already available through the voluntary approach. We expect this will not incur any additional costs to those sectors already providing usage 13 Antimicrobial Resistance Collaborative, Global burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance in 2019: a systematic analysi s, The Lancet, 2022. 14 HM Government, Tackling antimicrobial resistance 2019 to 2024, publishing.service.gov.uk , 2019. 15 Antibiotic Research UK, Save Our Antibiotics Appeal, antibioticresearch.org.uk , 2017. 10 data, although we will be seeking evidence of the costs to other sectors not yet providing such data at consultation. 64. These proposed changes will increase the burden on applicants to supply information as part of an M A application for a new antibiotic veterinary medicine. Familiarisation costs are covered in Table 2, however we would be looking to find out more about the expected impacts at consultation. We do not expect that new staff, equipment or systems will be needed to conduct these assessments. 65. They will also cause a greater burden on prescribers, increasing the time and information required to prescribe antibiotics for prophylactic use. Table 3 shows the estimated cost for veterinary practices based on the impact of an additional hour a week needing to be spent on evaluating and jus tifying prescription of antibiotic veterinary medicines. Table 3 - Expected cost for vets of prescription requirements for antibiotic medicines Number of vets in Overall cost large/farm animal Cost per hour (\u00a3)Overall cost (\u00a3) (\u00a3), +22% non -Time required per costs 16week 247 1 hours 25.67 329,705 402,240 66. However, these changes will prevent unnecessary prescription of antibiotics, for example where alternative medicines are available , and prevent the use of antibiotics as an alternative to good animal husbandry.17 This will help to protect the efficacy of these products. 67. These changes will ensure the safe supply of antibiotics, as well as ensu ring they are supplied and administered responsibly and effectively. This will reduce the risk of development and spread of AMR. Marketing authorisations 68. The requirements for M A applications will be updated to remove regulatory burden where appropriate and allow for innovation, such as allowing pictograms and QR codes on product labelling, and to better reflect the requirements for novel therapies. The proposed changes will incen tivise M A holders to continue to invest in new and innovative veterinary medicines and increase the availability of veterinary medicines in GB. 69. Applications will need to be submitted electronically, unless there is an emergency situation, and the data to be submitted will be outlined within the VMR; this will mean that applications are no longer submitted in paper format. This change should not incur any additional costs for industry as it does not change the data requirements, only the format in which they must be supplied. All M A applications are currently submitted electronically, so this change will have no impact on M A holders, however provides additional certainty that applications from new M A holders will be accessible for assessment and that the re are no delays in the authorisation process . 70. The criteria for refusal of M A applications will be updated, including refusal of antibiotics reserved for human use, indicated for performance enhancement or growth promotion, or where a risk related to AMR has not been addressed. The familiarisation costs for these changes are covered under the M A holders' familiarisation costs. The requirement for the VMD to publish decisions will now include decisions to refuse, suspend, revoke and amend M A s. 71. The provision setting out distribution categories will be amended to clarify the categories of veterinary medicines that should only be available on veterinary prescription. This will ensure the necessary checks are in place for medicines that require veterinary 16 Dilys Robinson, Megan Edwards, Bethany Mason, James Cockett, Kate Arnill . Graham and Alex Martin, The 2019 Survey of the Veterinary Profession, Institute for Employment Studies, 2019. 17 Responsible Use of Medicines in Agriculture Alliance, Responsible Use of Vaccines and Vaccination in Farm Animal Production - General Guidance, ruma.org.uk. 11 assessment of the animal before prescription, and that medicines which do not need to be as strictly controlled are more readily available. 72. Data protection periods will be extended to encourage development of new veterinary medicines, particularly for antibio tics, medicines with a new active substance, medicines for bees and medicines which demonstrate a reduction in AMR. The protection period will be amended so certain new products are decoupled from the global M A so that they can also benefit from data prot ection periods, provided they come in separate packaging. Data protection periods are used to encourage innovation by rewarding marketing authorisation holders with a period of exclusivity during which time a generic version of their product cannot be plac ed on the market. The data protection period starts from when a product first receives authorisation, and currently lasts for 10 years (13 years for fish and bees). Extending data protection periods may incentivise continued investment in new and novel pro ducts for minor species (such as bees), therefore enhancing the attractiveness of the market to develop and supply veterinary medicines, thus increasing the availability of medicines and having significant indirect impacts.18 73. We will remove the requirement for renewal of M A s and registrations for homeopathic remedies, but we continue to monitor the safety of the product through improved pharmacovigilance requirements for information submitted by M A holders. The pharmaceutical industry has identified that compliance with renewal re quirements constitutes 13% of their total administrative burden.19 We estimate that the average renewal application for an M A will take approximately 15 hours for an individual M A holder. We have assumed that the person preparing the application and associated data requirements would be a research and development manager. We estimate an annual cost saving to industry of \u00a3137,030. M A holders will also save the cost of the renewal application fee of \u00a31,360 per application. Table 4 shows the total savings across the sector. Table 4 - Expected savings from Marketing Authorisation ( M A) renewals Average number of renewals per year M A holder time for each renewal Cost per hour Overall savings (\u00a3) Overall savings (\u00a3), +22% non- wage costs 240 15 hours 31.20 112,320 137,030 74. Labelling requirements will be updated to ensure that the necessary information is captured, whilst minimising the burden for industry and providing opportunities for dual labelling and other cost saving benefits. These changes will facilitate joint labelling and reduce the costs for companies because they will be able to combine labels for products marketed in multipl e countries, although there will be initial direct costs for designing new labels. Variations between countries on the required content of packaging and labelling are a major burden for industry. They have identified that compliance with labelling rules constitutes the largest part of their total administrative burden (34% of the total administrative burden).20 75. Any risks associated with the reduction of information provided on the packaging and labelling would be offset by placing the information on the product leaflet and by making the information available through other sources (for example, through QR codes). This would result in initial costs for companies who cho ose to redesign their labels but could lead to reduced annual costs for labelling and pri nting. If the costs of packaging are reduced, this may encourage companies to apply for authorisations for medicines for minor species or conditions, therefore increasing the availability of such medicines. 18 RCVS Research Subcommittee, Veterinary Research in the UK: A Snapshot , Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, 2013. 19 European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document Impact Assessment on the Proposal for a Regulation of The European Parliament and of the Council on Veterinary Medicinal Products, eur-lex.europa.eu, 2014, pp. 86-87. 20 European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document Impact Assessment on the Proposal for a Regulation of The European Parliament and of the Council on Veterinary Medicinal Products, eur -lex.europa.eu, 2014, pp. 86-87. 12 76. The average cost for updating the packaging and l abelling for products is \u00a3 9,000 for each pack size authorised.21 This includes the costs of redesigning the artwork, print runs and disposal of out-of-date packaging material. We will aim to gather more information on the total costs and savings of these c hanges at consultation. 77. Electronic Package Information Leaflets (EPILs) will be accepted as an alternative to physical package leaflets, where appropriate, and labelling will be able to use QR codes to link to this, although it will not replace the require ment to provide a physical package leaflet where necessary. This may have initial costs for redesigned labels but will allow industry to save significant printing costs overall and allow for easier dual labelling of products. 78. There will be changes to facil itate simultaneous submission for M A applications in collaboration with other global regulators. This will encourage applications in GB and expand markets for GB M A holders. This may also reduce costs for the pharmaceutical industry, as this change could result in reduced labelling costs across these countries , and single company project teams working simultaneously across multiple regulatory jurisdictions. 79. M A holders will be required to report supply shortages to the VMD. This will allow early consideration of the issue and implementation of possible mitigations within reasonable timeframes, reducing the impact to supply and risk to animal welfare. Some companies already provide this information to the VMD. Table 5 shows the estimated cost to industry for reporting supply shortages. Table 5 - Cost of reporting supply shortages Additional number of reports M A holder time for each report Cost per hour Overall cost (\u00a3) Overall cost (\u00a3), +22% non-wage costs 20 0.5 hours 31.20 312 381 80. M A holders will no longer be permitted to wholesale supply veterinary medicines unless they hold a wholesale dealer's authorisation ( or hold a manufacturing authorisation). This change will ensure we have appropriate oversight of wholesale dealing activities in GB. M A holders will already have the appropriate staff and systems in place for wholesale dealing, therefore we estimate that the only additional costs will be the application and inspection costs for obtaining a wholesale dealer's authorisation , shown in Table 6 and Table 7. Table 6 - Expected preparation cost for M A holders to apply for wholesale dealer's authorisation s Number of companies affected M A holder inspection preparation time Cost per hour Overall cost (\u00a3) Overall cost (\u00a3), +22% non-wage costs 20 10 hours 31.20 6,240 7,613 Table 7 - Expected application cost for M A holders to apply for wholesale dealer's authorisation s Number of companies affected Application fee cost (\u00a3) Inspection fee cost (\u00a3) Overall cost (\u00a3) 20 344 1,177 30,420 21 Data from a survey of MA holders on the contingency plans for EU Exit . 13 81. Homeopathic remedies will be restricted to oral or topical routes of administration and may not be biological homeopathic remedies. The holders of a homeopathic registration will also be able to use a local represent ative, we will not require the holder to be based in GB. These changes will result in reduced burden for registration holders and will contribute to the safety of homeopathic remedies and protect animal welfare. Manufacturers 82. The proposed changes for manufacturers give the option for VMD inspectors to grant conditional manufacturing authorisations where appropriate. This change will have no cost impact on new or established manufacturers as it is already a regulatory requirement. 83. Importers of veterinary medicines from other countries will need to ensure, where applicable, that the manufacturer holds a certificate of good manufacturing practice (GMP), or an equivalent confirmation recognised by the Secretary of State. This will ensure that the overseas manufacturer has the competent staff and facilities to manufacture high -quality, safe and effective veterinary medicines for placing on the GB market. This does not change the current expectations on manufacturers, however should increase transparency for the veterinary medicines sector. 84. The key personnel required for a manufacturing authorisation ( ManA) will be listed in the VMR. ManA holders must name a Qualified Person (QP), a person responsible for Quality Control (QC) and a Product ion Manager (PM) with either the qualifications or experience to fulfil the role. This will not incur any additional costs to industry as these roles are a current requirement of GMP. Holders of other manufacturing authorisations must be under the supervis ion of a person who has the required qualifications or experience to be approved by the Secretary of State, removing the requirement for this person to be a vet. This will make the requirements clearer and provide a greater pool of qualified personnel for the positions. This will also not incur any additional costs to industry as this role is a current requirement in the VMR. 85. A new provision is being introduced that will require registration of manufacturers, importers and distributors of active substances for veterinary use. Active substances are the raw ingredients used to make finished medicines and give the medicine its therapeutic effect. The registration will allow the VMD to ensure that active substances manufactured and used for veterinary medicines in GB are safe and of high -quality. Active substance manufacturers are already required to comply with the principles of GMP, therefore there will be no additional costs for new personnel, equipment or processes. The only cost is expected to be the cost of registering, which would be a basic administrative process . We will be looking to gain more evidence on the number of businesses impacted by this change and the costs associated with registration , provided in Table 8. Table 8 - Expected cost of active ing redients manufacturer registration Number of companies Company time for registration Cost per hour Overall cost (\u00a3) Overall cost (\u00a3), +22% non-wage costs 55 1 hour 30.94 1,702 2,076 86. New requirements will be introduced that ensure the prescribing cascade (a decision tree for vets to be used when a suitable authorised veterinary medicine is not available) is used appropriately and responsibly. For example, we propose to make it an offence to manufacture an (unauthorised) extemporaneous product that is pharmaceutically equivalent to an authorised product. The changes will also require manufacturers of extemporaneous products to provide the VMD with a list of the formulations which they have manufactured. This will result in a greater burden for these manufacturers, but the 14 information should be readily available. The information will ensure that the VMD has the details of manufacturers of active ingredients in the event of a safety concern or a veterinary medicine incident and who we can approach in the event of a supply issue with a critically required authorised medicine. The changes will contribute to the protection of animal health, public health and the environment . They will also ensu re fair competition, where M A holders who applied for, and have been granted, M A s are not inappropriately competing against unauthorised products. The cost of the provision of this information is outlined in Table 9. Table 9 - Expected cost for submissi on of extemporaneous products manufactured Number of companies Company time for provision of information Cost per hour Overall cost (\u00a3) Overall cost (\u00a3), +22% non-wage costs 22 5 hours 30.94 3,403 4,152 87. Stem cell centre authorisations will be required for all non -food producing species, in addition to horses. This will lead to more burden on stem cell centres providing treatments for non -equine species as they will have to apply for an authorisation and have an inspection of their site, but it will provide necessary safeguards for the manufacture and use of stem cell treatments. The expected costs for these applications are shown in Table 10 and Table 11. Table 10 - Expected preparation costs for Stem Cell Centre Authorisations Number of companies affected Authorisation holder inspection preparation time Cost per hour Overall cost (\u00a3) Overall cost (\u00a3), +22% non-wage costs 10 10 hours 31.20 3,120 3,806 Table 11 - Expected application costs for Stem Cell Centre Authorisations Number of companies affected Application fee cost (\u00a3) Inspection fee cost (\u00a3) Overall cost (\u00a3) 10 762 2,142 29,040 Pharmacovigilance 88. The total number of adverse event reports received by the VMD during the 2021 -22 financial year covered 9,133 cases. The number of animal adverse event reports during that period was 9,010. These include animal adverse reactions, suspected lack of efficacy cases, environmental cases and residue incidents. The number of human adverse event reports was 123. 89. There are currently no legal requirements to report an adverse event in the environment. Pharmacovigilance requirements under the VMR will be extended from the reporting of adverse reactions (lack of efficacy or side -effects caused to humans or animals) to include all adverse events (such as adverse impacts on the environment). 90. There will be new requirements for MA holders to establish more robust pharmacovigilance systems and take more action in response to adverse events where necessary. The Secretary of State will be given the power to carry out inspections to ensure pharmacovigilance activity is being carried out correctly. This will result in familiarisation costs, covered in Table 2, as well as direct costs for setting up new systems. However, we believe streamlining pharmacovigilance reporting will save significant costs for industry, by reducing the need to submit multiple different data sets to different regulators and reduce the administrative burden of the process by making the requirements simpler. We are proposing to move from the provision of a Detailed Description of the Pharmacovigilance System (DDPS) to a Pharmacovigilance Masterfile 15 System (PSMF) which means a reduction in burdens to industry. Currently any change to the DDPS needs to be applied to every product held by the M A holder, whereas the PSMF covers all products held by the M A holder, so only one change is required. The current system also requires a Periodic Safety Upda te Report (PSUR) every 6 months for the first year of a product's life, then every year for the next 2 years, and then every 3 years thereafter. Companies will have a range of product authorisations, from as small a number as 5 to up to 1,000. The pharmace utical industry estimated that the average number of PSURs is 50 per year, indicative of as many as 500 workdays per PSUR.22 It has not been possible to quantify the impacts on the changes to the pharmacovigilance systems; we will ask the pharmaceutical in dustry to provide data on the costs and savings as part of the consultation. 91. The changes will also help ensure medicines continue to be safe and effective and improve the VMD's capacity to respond to adverse events which will also help protect public health, the food chain and the environment. Prescribing and s upply 92. We will clarify that veterinary medicines that contain antibiotics or beta -agonists, or that are used for euthanasia, or that are immunological or hormonal are subject to veterinary prescription. This will not result in any additional costs. 93. We have reviewed the information required to prescribe a veterinary medicine. The proposed changes will standardise the requirements for all prescribers (vets, pharmacists and Suitably Qualified Persons (S QPs)) and discourage prescription misuse. This will increase responsible prescribing and availability of veterinary medicines across GB and improve animal welfare. 94. The changes, such as to state if the medicine is for prophylactic or metaphylactic use, will provide more assurance that the veterinary medicine is being appropriately prescribed and will be used responsibly. Prophylaxis is the administration of a medicine to an animal or group of animals before clinical signs of a disease in order to prevent the occurrence of disease or infection. Metaphylaxis is the administration of a medicin e to a group of animals after a diagnosis of clinical disease in part of that group, with the aim of treating the clinically sick animals and controlling the spread of the disease to animals in close contact and at risk of contracting the disease . 95. SQPs will be given the ability to prescribe remotely, in line with the requirements for vets, which will reduce the regulatory burden on SQPs. We estimate this will allow an SQP to delegate certain tasks to non -qualified colleagues, which will benefit industry and present savings as demonstrated in Table 12. Table 12 - Estimated prescriptions and supply savings for SQPs Number of companies Time delegated from SQP to assistant per week Cost per hour (\u00a3) Overall annual savings (\u00a3) Overall savings (\u00a3), +22% non- 20.52 (SQP) 11.98 (Assistant) 299,754 365,700 96. As the ownership of pets increases in GB, these changes will ensure that a wide range of veterinary medicines continues to be available to protect the pets' welfare.23 The changes to prescribing veterinary medicines, such as extending the ability to prescribe 22 European Commission, Commission Staff Working Document Impact Assessment on the Proposal for a Regulation of The European Parliament and of the Council on Veterinary Medicin al Products, eur-lex.europa.eu, 2014, p. 91. 23 Statista Research Department , Pet ownership in the UK 2021/22, stat ista.com, 2022. 16 remotely to SQPs, will help ensure access to veterinary medicines across GB, includin g in rural areas where there generally are fewer prescribers available. 97. Vets and pharmacists will only be able to order veterinary medicines for supply to authorised premises, as is the current situation with SQPs. This will help encourage fair competition amongst prescribers. We do not expect there to be cost implications for this change. 98. We are proposing to amend the requirements for prescription by a vet. This will clarify that a product requiring a vet's prescription can be prescribed after a clinical e xamination or any other proper assessment of an animal under the vet's care - in other words, a physical examination may not be needed in all cases. Th ese savings are shown in Table 13. Table 13 - Estimated savings for vets from remote prescribing Number of vets in large/farm animal practice24 Time saved per week (year) Cost per hour (\u00a3) Overall annual savings (\u00a3) Overall savings (\u00a3), +22% non- wage costs 247 1 hour (52 hours) 25.67 329,705 402,240 99. Annual audit requirements will be strengthened for suppliers of veterinary medicines, including wholesale dealers, with a requirement to record any discrepancies in the stock of veterinary medicines. This may result in increased annual costs; however, it w ill help improve the security of the veterinary medicine supply chain and will only incur costs where discrepancies are found. 100. Wholesale dealers of veterinary medicines will be required to report veterinary medicines that are suspected to be counterfeit o r falsified. This will help to provide a secure supply chain for veterinary medicines in GB. We will be seeking evidence on the costs to industry at consultation. 101. Online retailers will be required to register with the VMD and display a registration logo on their website. This will result in increased burden for retailers of veterinary medicines; however it will provide assurance for animal owners and help direct customers to legitimate businesses. The implementation of this option would ring-fence legitimate businesses in GB, as end users would be able to recognise legal internet retailers (those with a logo) from unregistered ones and so be able to make an informed choice when deciding to purchase veterinary medicines on the internet. The cost of registering websites is shown in table 14. Table 14 - Estimated registration costs for online retailers Number of companies Company time for registration Cost per hour (\u00a3) Overall cost (\u00a3) Overall 15,031 18,338 102. We will introduce an offence for submitting one non -repeat prescription to multiple retailers. This will provide the Secretary of State with greater ability to tackle and deter prescription misuse and ensure the security and integrity of the supply chain to protect animal welfare. 24 Dilys Robinson, Megan Edwards, Bethany Mason, James Cockett, Kate Arnill . Graham and Alex Martin, The 2019 Survey of the Veterinary Profession, Institute for Employment Studies, 2019. 17 Marketing under e xemption for small pet animals 103. A register will be established by the Secretary of State for veterinary medicines marketed under the ex emption for small pet animals. This may result in increased regulatory burden for those who market these medicines but will provide access for the Secretary of State to this information in the event of a safety concern or veterinary medicine incident. It will also enable small pet animal owners to recognise legitimate businesses, preventing unfair competition and ensuring the safety of medicines for small pet animals. The cost of this registration is outlined in Table 15. Table 15 - Estimate cost of registration of products marketed under the small pet animal exemption Number of companies Company time for registration Cost per hour (\u00a3) Overall cost (\u00a3) Overall cost (\u00a3), 5 hours 30.94 2,011 2,454 Feedingstuffs 104. The proposed changes related to medicated feed and specified feed additives will provide definitions for specific terms and further clarify certain requirements under the VMR, such as stating that advertising regulations also apply to feedingstuffs. This will ensure the requirements for feed business operators are easy to find and transparent. These costs have been quantified with the overall familiarisation costs in Table 2. 105. The requirements for medicated feedingstuff prescriptions (MFSp) will be amended to ensure that an MFSp contains the necessary information for medicated feedingstuffs to be manufactured, supplied and used, and that supply of medicated feedingstuffs is only in accordance with a valid MSFp. 106. Labelling requirements will be extended to ensure th at the use of a feedingstuff is in accordance with its authorisation. Medicated feedingstuffs which also contain specified feed additives will need to include the required labelling for those specified feed additives. 107. The consultation will seek to gain evi dence of the costs these changes will add for industry and veterinary professionals. 108. We will amend the allowed analytical tolerance levels in the VMR to ensure they are achievable and still ensure the final medicated feed contains appropriate levels of active ingredient to ensure effective and safe treatment. We will be looking to gather more evidence at consultation to show the cost this change will have on industry. 109. We will also introduce carryover limits to ensure that the level of active ingredients present in non-target food (cross -contamination) is 'as low as reasonably achievable'. This will help to ensure feedingstuffs do not contain unintended ingredients, including antibiotics, and that veterinary medicines are only administered to t he target animals at the responsible and appropriate dosage. This principle is already followed by feed businesses as good practice and so should not result in increased costs. 110. These changes will result in increased compliance, fewer deficiencies for manufacturers and ensure high standards for feedingstuffs going into the food chain which contributes to more efficient and environmentally sustainable food production. This will also help to reduce the risk of a food incident caused as a result of deficiencies and reduce the severity of any incidents that do occur. Advertising 111. Changes proposed to provisions on advertising will include defining what we mean by 'advertising', clarifying and updating which veterinary medicines may be promoted to 18 targeted professio nal groups, and explicitly stating that it is an offence to advertise an unauthorised veterinary medicine, such as those prescribed under the cascade or with suspended M A. 112. The changes will ensure that only authorised veterinary medicines are advertised. This will prevent unfair competition and prevent advertising of illegal veterinary medicines. This will also help industry to reduce the amount of resource wasted creating non-compliant advertising. 113. A compliant industry will incur no additional costs from the changes, other than familiarisation costs, but will benefit from not competing against non -compliant businesses or individuals. Clearer requirements will save M A holders, manufacturers and suppliers costs of seeking advice on promotional material and amending non -compliant advertising. We will seek further evidence of the cost savings at consultation. Fees 114. Fee changes are not covered by this assessment under the statutory exemptions for the Better Regulations Framework.25 Table 16 shows the impact costs and benefits associated with implementing fee changes only under 'Option 1' , such as familiarisation costs and industry savings for M A renewals. Table 16 - 'Option 1', fee changes only, total costs and savings (includes familiarisation costs) Sector Costs (\u00a3) Savings (\u00a3) Overall (\u00a3) holders 3,233 137,030 Manufacturers 1,685 0 +1,685 Wholesale dealers 410 0 +410 Veterinary practices 10,053 0 +10,053 Veterinary pharmacists 11 0 +11 SQP retailers 1,098 0 +1,098 Feed business operators 2,486 0 +2,486 Professional keepers of animals 0 0 +0 Total 18,976 137,030 -118,054 Risks and unintended consequences 115. We do not expect there to be risks to bringing any of the proposed changes into force. The VMD has already engaged with industry sectors to gain early insight into expected impacts and implementation considerations. This has included workshops to discuss proposed changes with key indu stry stakeholders. Wider impacts 116. The proposed changes may lead to increased costs in certain areas, but they will also lead to increased benefits. 117. They will provide increased ability to tackle AMR, which w ould ultimately result in less cost for healthcar e and fewer lives lost and help work towards realising the UK's 20 25 Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, The Better Regulation Framework, publishing.service .gov.uk, 2020. 19 Year Vision for AMR. Bacterial infections unsuccessfully treated due to antibiotic resistance currently claim at least 700,000 lives per year worldwide and are projected to be associated with the deaths of 10 million people per year by 2050.26 118. The proposed changes will also help reduce development and spread of anthelmintic resistance by ensuring vets, pharmacists and SQPs record their prescribing decisions, thus encouraging proper assessmen t of the information obtained, including that provided by the animal owner, and therefore effective prescribing and treatment decisions. The overall annual cost of helminth infections in UK ruminants is estimated to be \u00a3266m, comprising approximately \u00a3198m in lost production and \u00a368m in treatment costs.27 These economic cost estimates do not reflect the potential longer -term financial and social impacts of anthelmintic resistance, where, if left unchecked, livestock production could become unprofitable, or even unsustainable on many properties. This could lead to significant damage to the UK livestock, meat and dairy sectors. The Gross Value Added of the livestock and meat processing and manufacturing sectors is estimated at around \u00a310.9bn per year.28 119. The changes to data protection periods for M A s will encourage innovation and research and development of new veterinary medicines , whilst achieving an optimal balance between innovator and generic veterinary medicines coming to the market, so that both sectors can thrive . 120. There will be additional safeguards for veterinary medicines and medicated feedingstuffs for food -producing animals which will hel p ensure a secure and safe food chain. Updated pharmacovigilance requirements will give M A holders greater capacity to monitor the veterinary medicines they market and take action to provide the greatest benefit to animal welfare, whilst protecting human health and the environment. 121. As the ownership of pets increases in GB, the proposed changes will ensure that a wide range of veterinary medicines continues to be available to protect the pets' welfare.29 The changes to prescribing veterinary medicines, such as extending the ability to prescribe remotely to SQPs, will help ensure access to veterinary medicines across GB, including in rural areas where there generally are fewer prescribers available. 122. Fee amendments will ensure the VMD is able to recover its costs for its regulatory services according to the principles laid down in HM Treasury's 'Managing Public Money'. 123. The proposed changes will also help secure the supply chain by ensuring veterinary medicines are stored, supplied and used safely and responsibl y. 5.0 Post implementation review 124. We will monitor and evaluate the changes if they are brought into force. We will publish updated guidance on GOV.UK to help the veterinary industry understand and implement these changes. 125. The Medicines and Medical Devices Act 202130 requires any amendments to the VMR to be reported on within 24 months of those changes coming into force, with subsequent reports within a further 24 -month period. We will start collecting the data for the first report at the point of the chang es coming into force. 26 The Review On Antimicrobial Resistance Chaired By Jim O'Neill, 160525_Final paper with cover.pdf (amr -review.org) 27 J.
