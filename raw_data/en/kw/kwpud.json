Sure, it can be nice to catch up on emails in front of some trashy daytime TV, but after a while, the muscle pain from being hunched over a [desk](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/gallery/best-computer-desks-home-office) all day is going to catch up with you. While you could upgrade your [chair](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/gallery/best-office-chairs-ergonomic) or invest in the [standing desk](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/gallery/best-standing-deskhttps://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/gallery/best-standing-desk) alternative, or even take to a percussive therapy [massage gun](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/fitness/gallery/best-massage-guns) to relieve a bit of tension, for a slightly more hardcore take of relaxation, how does lying on 8,000-plus spikes sound? If the acupressure mat isn't yet on your radar, this might sound a little strange. Billed as an effective and (surprisingly) pain-free way to de-stress, improve your circulation and relax your muscles (rather than penetrate the skin, as in acupuncture) acupressure stems from a 1,000-year-old practice, where similar constructions were used in meditation and healing. In the more modern take of the fast-growing obsession, the aptly named Bed Of Nails leads the market with mats and pillows in a variety of colours, each fitted with in-excess of 8,800 non-toxic plastic spikes. [Bed Of Nails](https://bedofnails.org/)' founder Carina Tannenberg explains that through lying on these mats for around 10 minutes a day, one could expect to experience such benefits as improved circulation, increased energy levels, reduced anxiety and stress, alleviated headache pain, relieved tension and improved sleep, to name a few. Sounds like just the thing for another long day of lockdown life, but then, so do most wellness fads. And this certainly has all the makings of the next big one: a dramatic name, a long list of too-good-to-be-true upshots and celebrity endorsements (we hear J-Lo's a big fan). Though the science and theory behind acupressure and similar forms of physical therapy is complex, according to physiotherapist/acupuncturist [Renata Nunes](https://www.rkntherapist.com/) and acupuncturist Edgar Cantelli, the principles check out, drawing on traditional Chinese medicine that analyses different energy flows to look at imbalances within the body. While Nunes does say that the mats aren't necessarily a \"homemade acupressure treatment\" as \"acupressure is more reactive and performed by working with specific points to tone and disperse energy\", she did say she would \"recommend it for a patient to increase the peripheral circulation of the back, especially if they are stressed, nervous or tired.\" She added that \"it is also recommended after an intense day of work, especially at home when you might not have the proper ergonomics and might be experiencing muscle fatigue.\" Sure enough, when we got our hands on one to try for ourselves, the results did not disappoint. The Bed Of Nails Acupressure Mat takes a bit of getting used to, and it's an unfamiliar feeling to start with, but with regular use, we noticed some significant improvements to neck and back pain. Lying on the mat for 10 minutes at the end of the day also feels surprisingly relaxing, helping to relinquish the stress of a hard day's work. Even if it was simply facilitating a moment away from our phones and any form of distraction in order to completely check-in with ourselves, honestly, it's a game-changer. With these kind of effects, it's no huge surprise that the Bed Of Nails has seen a major spike in demand over the pandemic. Just as we've seen other mindful practices such as [yoga](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/fitness/gallery/best-yoga-mat) and meditation apps grow in popularity, the mat's ability to help with work-from-home-related ailments and to foster a sense of self-care in a stressful time, makes it a worthwhile companion for homebound life. And, if you're going to invest in the mat, we'd also recommend adding the pillow, which you can use on your head, neck, back or feet while working at your [desk](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/lifestyle/gallery/best-computer-desks-home-office), or simply while lounging around in the evening. As with most wellness investments, don't expect an acupressure mat to cure you of any longstanding issues overnight - this is no replacement for proper treatment or physical therapy by a healthcare professional. Nor should you see it as an excuse to throw caution to a carefully set-up home-working environment in place of your bed. That said, for a bit of relief and relaxation, it definitely does the trick, and for only \u00a370, we're deeming it a work-from-home must-have. Bed Of Nails mat, \u00a370.
