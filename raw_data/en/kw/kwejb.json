Her sentiment resonated with me, and I have heard it repeated in countless variations since. Throughout my career, I have always been happiest when I felt I was part of a family. Professionally, I feel at home at BMC, where I am privileged to represent and serve the brilliant, dynamic, committed people who have made BMC Surgery their working home. In contrast, for many of our patients, a lack of stable housing and potentially unsafe home environments are among the social determinants of health that deeply impact their lives. As a result, their healthcare outcomes can suffer. At BMC and in the Department of Surgery, we are pioneering holistic approaches to care that can help our patients combat these underlying issues, while educating and advocating more broadly to address inequities in surgical care (see page 16). We continue to foster and grow diversity within our family of trainees, faculty, and staff, and are also pleased to lead initiatives that promote a diverse bench and new connections within academic surgery. As I write this, our department, led by local arrangements chair and BMC trauma surgeon Tejal Brahmbhatt, MD, is preparing to host the annual meeting of the Society of Asian Academic Surgeons (SAAS) on our vibrant campus at the end of September. Of note, SAAS denes \"Asian\" in the broadest sense, and all who welcome diversity in academic surgery are invited. We look forward to welcoming surgeons from around the world to learn from our family at BUSM and BMC. The annual report also highlights by way of example how BMC surgeons are changing the national landscape of chronic disease. In this report, we focus on vascular surgery research. The international, multi-specialty BEST-CLI trial is poised to answer pressing questions about how to treat patients with life-threatening chronic limb ischemia (CLI). BEST-CLI is one of 45 research projects currently underway in the Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, which continues to make its mark as a powerhouse in scholarly activity (see page 17). Our family extends well beyond our doors and continues to evolve through collaborations old and new (see page 19). Our friends and supporters, as well as our patients and trainees, continue to inspire all of us in our daily work. Providing compassionate, high-quality patient care, training the next generation of surgeons, and conducting impactful research is a team sport. This report reflects some of the noteworthy individual and collaborative efforts of our team\u2014our collective family\u2014over the last year.

Located in Boston's historic South End, BMC is the primary teaching hospital of the Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) and was created by the 1996 merger of Boston City Hospital (founded in 1855) and Boston University Medical Center Hospital (founded in 1864). BMC is the largest and busiest provider of trauma and emergency services, and the largest safety-net hospital, in New England. BMC provides a full spectrum of pediatric and adult care services, from primary care and family medicine to advanced surgical and medical specialty care. he Department of Surgery has a long, proud history, with roots that extend back more than 150 years. In 1873, Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) opened its doors, combining the New England Female Medical College with the medical staff of the Massachusetts Homeopathic Hospital. The modern history of the Department of Surgery at Boston University dates to 1946, when Dr. Reginald H. Smithwick was recruited from Massachusetts General Hospital to serve as Surgeon-in-Chief and Chair of Surgery at BUSM. Dr. Smithwick served in those positions for nearly 20 years. Among the surgeons who have led and contributed to the international stature of the Department of Surgery throughout the ensuing decades are Drs. Richard Egdahl, John Mannick, Lester Williams, Peter Mozden, Robert Hobson, Edward Spatz, James Becker, and Gerard Doherty. In July 2017, Jennifer F. Tseng, MD, MPH, was recruited as Chair and Utley Professor of Surgery at BUSM and Surgeon-in-Chief at Boston Medical Center (BMC). The Department of Surgery comprises 14 divisions, or sections, and includes 58 faculty members. A well-established relationship with Boston Children's Hospital provides shared faculty in pediatric critical care and pediatric general surgery, as well as pediatric training for residents. The department also has afliated faculty members from Roger Williams Medical Center, the Veterans Administration (VA) Boston Healthcare System, and Cape Cod Hospital (Cape Cod Healthcare). The Departments of Surgery at the VA Boston Healthcare System and Roger Williams are valued partners in teaching and training medical students and residents (see page 19). This annual report provides an overview of some of the clinical programs, research, and educational initiatives of the previous academic year (July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019) and highlights a few of the many accomplishments and activities of our faculty, trainees, and alumni. We invite you to visit our website (bumc.bu.edu/surgery) and follow us on social media (@BMCSurgery) to keep abreast of our activities throughout the year.

From simply reading about a procedure to actually holding the scalpel, making the cut, and improving a patient's life\u2014right there on the operating table. For Jen Jen Yeh, MD, that point came during her general surgery residency at Boston Medical Center (BMC) from 1997 to 2003. \"Residency is always a seminal part of training to become a surgeon,\" says Dr. Yeh, now a professor in the Departments of Surgery and Pharmacology at the University of North Carolina (UNC) School of Medicine, Vice Chair of Research in the Department of Surgery, and Co-Director of Clinical Research at the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. \"When you're a medical student, you have these aspirations, this very idealistic perspective of what you think surgery is about. But it's not until training that you really understand the complexities of how to be a surgeon.\" Technical know-how from a compassionate place Of course, would-be surgeons have choices when it comes to training programs. But at BMC and the Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM), there is something particularly enriching and immersive about the experience, which is what made Dr. Yeh excited to match with the program after medical school at Johns Hopkins. \"The technical training was really phenomenal at BMC, and it prepared me to tackle complex surgeries,\" she says. \"I felt like I had a lot of autonomy to think about medicine, but most importantly, BMC taught me the philosophy of taking really good care of patients, and of being a really good doctor overall.\" Not only did she learn the fundamentals of good doctoring, she did so within the context of care equity. That is, treating and working with people from all walks of life, regardless of their circumstances. \"One of the things I really valued from my experience was the fact that BMC took care of patients from all social and economic statuses,\" she says. \"And that trickled back to the way we all worked together. The staff truly acted as a team, and that really resonated with me.\" Launchpad for success Those lessons served as a lifelong launchpad for Dr. Yeh's future successes, which have been ample on both the scientic bench and at the bedside. In addition to running a medical practice that specializes in endocrine diseases and pancreatic cancers, she has devoted her career to nding new genomic-based approaches for one of oncology's deadliest and toughest-to-treat diseases: pancreatic cancer.\"I chose to focus on pancreatic cancer because I felt like it was an area in which we, as surgeons, were plateauing\u2014not moving the needle far enough for our patients,\" she says. \"I wanted to contribute to research by understanding the biology of pancreatic cancer and nding new ways to treat it, and I wanted to make a difference in the clinic by helping patients choose the best therapy for them.\" Indeed, she's well on her way. Dr. Yeh's achievements include identifying new molecular subtypes of pancreatic cancer and helping develop a device to shrink pancreatic tumors via direct-to-tissue chemo infusion. You can nd her work in the pages of Nature Genetics and Science Translational Medicine, among other journals. Just recently, she was named an Oliver Smithies Investigator (established in honor of the late Nobel Prize winner at UNC).T Jen Jen Yeh, MD, completed her surgical residency at Boston Medical Center in 2003. She is now a professor in the Departments of Surgery and Pharmacology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, and Vice Chair of Research in the Department of Surgery. BMC-003 Surgery Annual Report 2019_F.indd 11 9/13/19 2:19 PMBUSM/BMC Department of Surgery Annual Report 2019 12 Phenomenal mentorship Dr. Yeh's work amounts to quite an impressive CV, one made possible by a roster of esteemed physicians and mentors who encouraged, challenged, and defended her along the way. Chief among them\u2014 pun intended\u2014was BMC's very own Bob Beazley, MD, FACS, now Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and an Emeritus Professor of Surgery. During Dr. Yeh's time at BMC, he was Chief of Surgical Oncology. \"He continues to be a phenomenal mentor for me, and he's a great clinician, a great surgeon,\" she says. \"He taught us the history behind surgery. I take everything I learned from him.\" Others shaped Dr. Yeh's experience at BMC in equally unique ways\u2014 like David McAneny, MD (now BMC's Vice Chair of Surgery and Professor of Surgery at BUSM). \"He was only a junior attending when I was there, so he probably started just a few years before I came, but seeing his relationship with Dr. Beazley was a great experience for me on how to mentor others. Now, looking back, it taught me how to encourage and promote young faculty.\" In fact, it was Dr. McAneny, together with Chair of Surgery Jennifer Tseng, MD, MPH, who invited Dr. Yeh back to BMC as a visiting professor in November 2018, an invitation she enthusiastically accepted. \"It was fabulous to be able to participate in the students' day and their education,\" she says. \"There were even a couple of attendings who were interns when I was a chief resident. It was great to go back and share memories with a lot of people who are still there, and to meet new people, too.\" Multidisciplinary problem solving The ability to return to her residency alma mater some two decades later as a visiting professor really signies the full-circle path of Dr. Yeh's work. Not only is she an esteemed clinician and scientist, she's also a teacher\u2014one who is particularly committed to helping the next generation nd their own way at the crossroads of science and medicine.\"Physician-scientists are really important, but fewer people are pursuing it because of the hurdles of balancing two careers,\" says Dr. Yeh, who organized a series of surgery-engineering speed dates at UNC to foster collaboration between researchers and physicians. \"But we, as clinicians, aren't the only people who can solve clinical problems,\" she adds. \"There are a lot of people who have different experiences, so I think multidisciplinary approaches from out-of-the-box areas can be really exciting.\" A guiding force As a teacher, one focus for Dr. Yeh is helping trainees home in on and then achieve their goals. \"For me, it's most important to gure out what people's interests are,\" Dr. Yeh says. \"And then it's about providing a roadmap on how to get there. I'd like to think I have a lot to teach based on my own hurdles and experiences\u2014and that I can make things a little easier on future researchers and physicians by being there to help them.\" And of course, that perspective is thanks in no small part to Dr. Yeh's time at BMC. \"I don't think that I could have gotten the quality of training that I got at any other program, or had the supportive faculty and role models that I found at BMC,\" she adds. \"I feel very fortunate to have trained there.\"\" The technical training was really phenomenal at BMC, and it prepared me to tackle complex surgeries. ... but most importantly, BMC taught me the philosophy of taking really good care of patients, and of being a really good doctor overall.\" \u2014 Jen Jen Yeh, MD Dr. Yeh confers with Al Baldwin, PhD, Associate Director for Basic Research at the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. BMC-003 Surgery Annual Report 2019_F.indd 12 9/13/19 2:19 PM13 bumc.bu.edu/surgery hen Bostonians hear about a gunshot victim who was rushed to an unnamed hospital, chances are it was Boston Medical Center (BMC). Known for the skill of its clinicians in treating gunshot and stab wounds, BMC sees the highest percentage of penetrating trauma cases in the city, double that of any other Level 1 Trauma Center. BMC's reputation for providing excellent trauma care stretches well beyond these types of injuries and across generations. Many of those lucky enough to survive the 1942 Cocoanut Grove nightclub re, the deadliest nightclub re in U.S. history, were treated at BMC, then called Boston City Hospital. More recently, BMC mobilized in April 2013 to treat dozens of victims of the Boston Marathon bombings. Consistent with national trends, falls are the primary source of traumatic injury at BMC, but interpersonal violence comes in at a close second. \"There's been an evolution in trauma care over the last seven or eight years to frame care in the context of social determinants,\" says Peter Burke, MD, Chief of Acute Care and Trauma Surgery at BMC and Professor of Surgery at Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM). \"In the past, we did nothing to deal with the psychological damage that violence does to the patient and the whole family\u2014the secondary ripples.\" Through research and formal programs such as the Community Violence Response Team (CVRT), which provides counseling to survivors of violence and family members impacted by violence free of charge, Burke and his team have made it their mission to better understand why violence occurs, to look for ways to prevent it, and to support victims when it does.

Fighting the Disease of TraumaHighlight: Patient Care WChief of Acute Care and Trauma Surgery Peter Burke, MD, and Chief of Surgical Critical Care Tracey Dechert, MD BMC-003 Surgery Annual Report 2019_F.indd 13 9/13/19 2:19 PMBUSM/BMC Department of Surgery Annual Report 2019 14Treating the whole patient \"As trauma surgeons, we can all x a gunshot wound to the aorta, but the thing that really makes BMC different from other trauma surgery services is our holistic approach to care,\" says Aaron Richman, MD, Assistant Professor of Surgery at BUSM. Dr. Richman did his residency at BMC and joined the staff in 2018 after completing a fellowship in Colorado. BMC's commitment to treating the whole patient\u2014even stronger today than when Dr. Richman rst started his residency\u2014drew him back. \"We view trauma as a chronic disease,\" says Tracey Dechert, MD, Chief of Surgical Critical Care at BMC and Director of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit, a state-of-the-art facility that has been reinvented and expanded over the last two years. \"Treating the injury and performing surgery is just one little piece. Through CVRT, we have a formal program to address everything else and provide patients with supportive care. There's so much amazing work being done here in underserved populations.\" BMC's Socially Responsible Surgery (SRS) group, established in 2014, is the brainchild of Dr. Dechert, an Associate Professor of Surgery at BUSM. Recognizing surgery as an essential component of health, this group is focused on identifying opportunities for leadership, research, and collaboration in the training of surgeons committed to surgical equity (see page 16). All hands on deck Dr. Dechert was at home on April 15, 2013, following a long night at BMC, when calls and texts started coming in shortly before 3 pm. By the time she reached the hospital 30 minutes later, Boston EMS had already arrived with patients gravely injured by two bombs that rocked the nish line of the Boston Marathon. With Trauma Surgery Chief Peter Burke attending a conference out of state, Dr. Dechert took charge of organizing the trauma surgery team, which worked with countless others, including Andrew Ulrich, MD, former Executive Vice Chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine. Dr. Ulrich directed and coordinated the immediate care of 28 patients, ranging in age from 5 to 78. The effort was intense but orderly, with 16 patients receiving emergency surgery within the rst 18 hours. Dr. Dechert recalls, \"We were running 11 operating rooms in three different buildings on the campus at the same time. But because we see mangled extremities on a regular basis, it really wasn't that different from what we do every day.\" Intangible benets Every day\u2014and night\u2014is different. Trauma surgeon Tejal Brahmbhatt, MD, describes his work as a trauma surgeon this way: \"Moments of calm interspersed with moments of pure terror.\" When multiple gunshot victims come in at once, \"we work like a NASCAR pit crew,\" says Dr. Brahmbhatt, an Assistant Professor of Surgery at BUSM. \"Who knows what trajectory a bullet might take? It's never the same operation, but our experience with penetrating trauma means the deck is stacked in favor of these patients.\" He adds, \"Caring for the underserved population BMC serves is very enriching in ways that are not tangible.\" It also provides a robust and invaluable experience for training in trauma surgery. \"The pathology that trainees see is second to none,\" says Dr. Brahmbhatt. \"Working at BMC is the best kept secret in Boston,\" according to Dr. Burke. \"The karma is great. We provide excellent care to patients who really need us, which adds great value to our lives.\" Trauma surgeon Tejal Brahmbhatt, MD Building Community Resilience Boston Medical Center's (BMC's) faculty and staff are experts in trauma treatment, renowned for their culturally responsive and innovative approaches to care delivery. The newly launched Boston Trauma Institute (BTI) will formalize BMC's leadership in the eld, with a goal of innovating, evaluating, and disseminating new models of care and support services for trauma survivors in Boston and beyond. Under the direction of Peter Burke, MD, Chief of Trauma Surgery, a major focus of the BTI will be on translational research, examining how social determinants of trauma impact victims of violence and the development and implementation of initiatives to reduce recidivism and enhance care delivery for these patients and their families. The institute's rst grant is funding a pilot study looking at the efcacy of BMC's psychosocial services for female victims of violent trauma.

Crisis Intervention eveloped with an understanding of the complex reality that often goes hand in hand with interpersonal violence, the Community Violence Response Team (CVRT) is integral to Boston Medical Center's trauma service and one of the few programs of its kind in the U.S. Now almost 10 years old, CVRT addresses the immense need victims of violence and their families have for services. Free of charge, CVRT provides mental health services to all patients who present to the hospital with life-threatening interpersonal violence injuries, including high-level assaults, stab wounds, and gunshot wounds. Every patient with these injuries is assigned a mental health clinician who provides crisis intervention, counseling, and ongoing therapeutic support at the bedside and upon discharge, to the patient as well as any family members or friends impacted by these acts of violence. CVRT also provides services to families affected by homicide. Led by Director Lisa Allee, MSW, LICSW, an Instructor in Surgery at Boston University School of Medicine, CVRT served nearly 700 individuals in scal 2018 and added two new clinicians. \"We are dedicated to providing consistent, trauma-informed and culturally sensitive therapeutic care to our community, says Allee. \"We aim to lessen the burden of chronic violence exposure by providing a safe and nurturing space to begin the healing process and by helping victims develop skills to carry them through both their physical and emotional recovery.\" CVRT services are primarily funded through a Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grant. D Exploring the Hidden Burden of Firearm Injuries MC receives 80% of the bullet and knife injuries in Boston. Even though many lives are saved, researchers are now suggesting that rearm violence survivors have not dodged the metaphorical bullet. \"From a healthcare economics standpoint, if someone is a survivor of rearm injury, you have ongoing care, long-term rehab, disability, and maybe signicant mental health issues,\" says Miriam Neufeld, MD, a surgery and research resident at Boston Medical Center. Neufeld and Sabrina Sanchez, MD, MPH, a BMC trauma surgeon, are working with colleagues at the Boston University School of Public Health to explore gaps in our knowledge of rearm injuries and uncover the true public health impact of gun violence. Firearm injuries could affect three times as many people each year as rearm deaths, but available data are not comprehensive. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers its own data unreliable. Even at the hospital level, gathering data is difcult. While hospital regulations are clear about how to code and report a traumatic death, they can be less clear about how to report traumatic injuries. Knowledge gap \"We pat ourselves on the back because we save a life after a horrible gunshot wound, but what happens after they go home?\" says Dr. Sanchez, an Assistant Professor of Surgery at Boston University School of Medicine. \"We know a lot about 30-day outcomes for trauma, but that's where most of the research ends.\" While Dr. Sanchez notes that this gap in knowledge is typical of traumatic injuries, it's particularly acute for rearm injuries. Drs. Neufeld and Sanchez' study builds on previous research done by Boston University colleagues at the school of public health, BPatients who receive excellent care in the OR at Boston Medical Center (BMC) also have the support of programs\u2014and people\u2014who are committed to serving them in times of crisis, advocating on their behalf, and conducting research aimed at increasing the odds that more people will live healthy, productive lives. Faculty, residents, students, and staff are playing a larger role in addressing issues at the heart of public health and in championing equitable care. Three examples of their work are highlighted here. BMC-003 Surgery Annual Report 2019_F.indd 15 9/13/19 2:19 PMBUSM/BMC Department of Surgery Annual Report 2019 16 he Socially Responsible SurgeryTM (SRS) group established at Boston Medical Center (BMC) ve years ago now has a trademarked name and its rst chapter. Afliated with UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, California, this new chapter was founded by Kara Kleber, MD, a surgery resident at the medical center and a graduate of Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM). BUSM students were the driving force behind the creation of SRS in 2014. Under the mentorship of trauma surgeon Tracey Dechert, MD, Associate Professor of Surgery at BUSM, SRS has grown into a multifaceted platform for students, residents, and faculty to combine their interest in surgery with their passion for serving the underserved. Because of SRS, curriculum on social determinants of health is now part of the curriculum for third-year medical students and residents. Upping utilization By establishing relationships with BMC service lines, SRS has made headway in ensuring faculty and staff are aware of key, often underutilized services. \"Many of our physicians were not well informed about how to write a prescription for a patient to visit BMC's food pantry,\" says Megan Janeway, MD, a surgery resident and founding member of SRS who just completed a two-year research fellowship studying the social determinants of health in surgical patients. \"Prior to our campaign, just one doctor wrote a prescription. After, 100 did.\" Through another recent project, SRS worked with the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology to ensure pregnant patients thinking about or planning to undergo tubal ligation are consistently and clearly informed of a Medicaid requirement that paperwork be completed 30 days prior to delivery. At present, more than two dozen SRS-related projects are ongoing, including several prospective and retrospective studies. Over the last year, the group has also actively advocated at the Massachusetts State House and elsewhere for migrants and other patient populations served by BMC every day. Dr. Kleber believes UC Davis Medical Center, the only Level 1 Trauma Center and quaternary referral center north of San Francisco, is an ideal place for an SRS chapter. \"We have a signicant opportunity to play a role in positively influencing current discussions on surgical inequity in northern California and beyond.\" Socially Responsible Surgery Expands Its Reach T which analyzed a database of gun-related legislation from every state going back to the early 1990s. Three types of legislation were found to be particularly effective in reducing rearm deaths: universal background checks, ID laws, and ammunition checks. The new research drills down into data from states that have seen dramatic changes in gun-related legislation. The goal is to determine specic laws that impact rearm injuries in order to identify effective, as opposed to \"performative,\" gun legislation, which enables states to say they are addressing gun violence but with little net effect. \"We're just starting to talk about gun violence as a public health problem, and how you balance individual rights with the public good is fundamental to public health,\" says Dr. Neufeld. \"Our research will help nd what works, so we have a logical place to start the debate about how to nd that balance.\"After presenting grand rounds at UC Davis School of Medicine, BMC trauma surgeon Tracey Dechert, MD, (in mauve jacket) shakes hands with Chair of Surgery Diana Farmer, MD. Also pictured are BMC resident Megan Janeway, MD, (second from left) and UC Davis SRS founder Kara Kleber, MD, (to right of Dr. Dechert). \" We're just starting to talk about gun violence as a public health problem, and how you balance individual rights with the public good is fundamental to public health.\" \u2014 Miriam Neufeld, MD bumc.bu.edu/surgeryGiving It Our BESThen peripheral arterial disease (PAD) progresses to chronic limb threatening ischemia\u2014also known as critical limb ischemia (CLI)\u2014patients are at high risk for leg amputation and death. To address the atherosclerosis underlying CLI and achieve revascularization, patients typically face a choice between open bypass surgery or endovascular therapy using balloons or stents. But with little data to guide clinical decision-making, an evidence-based standard of care for CLI patients does not exist. The BEST-CLI trial, now nearly 85% enrolled, is designed to provide answers that can ll this signicant void. Funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), the BEST-CLI (Best Endovascular vs. Best Surgical Therapy in Patients with Critical Limb Ischemia) trial is an international, multispecialty, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing clinical efcacy, functional outcomes, and cost effectiveness of surgical leg bypass and endovascular therapy. \"BEST-CLI is a pragmatic, real-world trial, and one of only a few NIH-sponsored trials spearheaded by vascular surgeons,\" says Alik Farber, MD, MBA, Chief of the Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery at Boston Medical Center and a national BEST-CLI trial principal investigator (PI). Co-PIs are Matthew Menard, MD, Co-director of Endovascular Surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Kenneth Roseneld, MD, Section Head for Vascular Medicine and Intervention at Massachusetts General Hospital. BEST-CLI is just one of 45 research projects currently underway in BMC's Division of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery. Since joining BMC in 2005, Dr. Farber, a Professor of Surgery and Radiology at Boston University School of Medicine, has led development of a multispecialty research collaborative based within the division. Over the course of the past year, multiple medical students, residents, and fellows were mentored on research projects that led to 33 manuscript publications and numerous podium and poster presentations. \"Our academic productivity and mentorship are a testament to the leadership of our surgeons, Jeff Siracuse, Doug Jones, and Jeff Kalish, who work tirelessly to engage in academic pursuits while taking excellent care of our patients with vascular disease,\" says Dr. Farber. Hamstrung by bias Over the past decade, the prevalence of PAD has increased by 25% worldwide, largely driven by the epidemic of obesity and diabetes, as well as an aging population. PAD and CLI are the most common vascular conditions treated at BMC, according to Dr. Farber, and there is great variability across the U.S. and around the world in how patients with CLI are treated. \"One of the most difcult barriers we've encountered in getting patients enrolled in this trial is treatment bias,\" says Dr. Farber. \"Because good trials to support treatment strategy in PAD are sparse, each physician has a strong personal bias as to whether bypass or endovascular therapy is Highlight: Research W \" Clinical outcomes, quality of life, and cost will help our healthcare-delivery system decide which strategy has the best value for patients with CLI.\" \u2014 Alik Farber, MD, MBA BMC-003 Surgery Annual Report 2019_F.indd 17 9/13/19 2:19 PMBUSM/BMC Department of Surgery Annual Report 2019 18 Chief of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Alik Farber, MD, MBA best for any given patient with CLI. Investigators need to suspend their personal biases to randomize patients into the trial.\" Often challenging, this has required Drs. Farber, Menard, and Roseneld to reach out to BEST-CLI site investigators through webinars, investigators meetings, and site visits to make the case for enrolling patients into the trial. The rst patient was enrolled at BMC in August of 2014. Currently, 930 investigators at 134 study sites in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and New Zealand are actively enrolling patients, with more than 1,760 patients randomized on the way to a goal of 2,100. Seventy-four percent of investigators are vascular surgeons, while 12% are interventional cardiologists and another 12% are interventional radiologists, with other specialties making up the remainder. Comprehensive report card When completed, BEST-CLI will answer many questions about how to treat patients with CLI. Physicians will have, for the rst time ever, evidence-based guidance regarding which revascularization strategy should be offered rst. The trial will provide longitudinally collected cost data for each treatment strategy, answering broader questions about value\u2014the same questions that are increasingly important for healthcare management in the U.S. This broad analysis will assess the cost of the initial intervention as well as down-the-line complications, outpatient rehabilitation, and subsequent hospitalizations. \"Clinical outcomes, quality of life, and cost will help our healthcare-delivery system decide which strategy has the best value for patients with CLI,\" says Dr. Farber. \"The fact that more than $7 billion is spent annually by Medicare on CLI is undoubtedly one of the primary reasons NHLBI chose to invest $27 million into BEST-CLI. These are big questions that badly need evidence-based answers.\" her rst surgery\u2014a laparotomy\u2014at Roger Williams Medical Center in nearby Providence, Rhode Island, was awe inspiring for one third-year Boston University medical student. Her reaction: \"Wow! This is amazing.\" Roger Williams is one of several surgery clerkship sites available to Boston University medical students. Options range from Boston Medical Center in the heart of the city to Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara Medical Center, in California's Silicon Valley. Through afliations with these and other institutions, Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) and the Department of Surgery at Boston Medical Center (BMC) offer medical students and residents options that expand and enrich their experience. For more than 15 years, BUSM students have been rotating through the Surgery service at Roger Williams Medical Center, a 220-bed general hospital and the largest academic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Rhode Island. \"At Roger Williams, the traditional general surgery clerkship is possible,\" says N.

A ve-decade partnership Another longtime collaboration spans more than 50 years and incorporates both medical students and residents. The VA Boston Healthcare System Surgery service, comprising 12 divisions, welcomes as many as 48 students and more than 30 residents from BUSM/BMC each year. \"As a referral center for all VAs in New England, the VA Boston has one of the most complex patient populations in the VA system and a very high patient volume,\" says Kamal Itani, MD, Chief of Surgery for the VA Boston Healthcare System and Professor of Surgery at BUSM. Dr. Itani points out that students and residents have exposure to procedures not typically offered at VA hospitals, including transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVAR), fenestrated endovascular aortic aneurysm several types of minimally invasive robotic surgery. \"The VA Boston is an integral part of surgical education at BMC, and we thrive on educating medical students and residents,\" says Vivian Sanchez, MD, Assistant Professor of Surgery at BUSM and site director for surgical residents at the VA Boston. The VA also welcomes anesthesia residents, who do their preliminary training there. While building their skillset before beginning the anesthesia residency program at BMC, \"they learn what it's like to be surgeons for a year and to work with their colleagues at the opposite end of the table,\" says Dr. Sanchez.From the Cape to California Another afliated teaching hospital and clinical site for residents for many years, Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Massachusetts, performs more than 12,500 surgical procedures each year. For medical students, two other Massachusetts hospitals actively participate in the third-year surgery clerkship, MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham and more recently, Berkshire Medical Center in Pittseld. The addition of Berkshire Medical Center and California's Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara Medical Center as clerkship sites has further strengthened the program, which has implemented a number of changes based on student feedback. \"Medical students aren't learning in a box because Boston University does a good job of incorporating outside faculty in teaching students,\" says Patrick O'Neal, MD, Assistant Professor of Surgery at BUSM and assistant director of the surgery clerkship at the VA Boston. He adds, \"The students really enjoy working with the veterans, and the experience provides perspective that is eye-opening for many.\" \"The level of commitment from the faculty at all of the afliated hospitals is fantastic,\" says Cullen Carter, MD, BUSM/BMC Surgery Clerkship Director. In addition to instructing and guiding students while onsite at Roger Williams and the VA Boston, faculty from both institutions teach medical students on the university's campus on Fridays. Research mentorship is also possible and encouraged at the VA Boston, home to several clinical trials and a very active medical research program, for residents as well as students (who can spend a summer doing research). Thanks to its size, at Roger Williams, there's an opportunity for more personalized education. And thanks to its size, BMC offers students the opportunity to see the unusual cases typical at a major urban medical center. Through collaboration across sites, both students and residents gain exposure to diverse healthcare needs and teams. \" The VA Boston is an integral part of surgical education at BMC, and we thrive on educating medical students and residents.\" \u2014 Vivian Sanchez, MD N.

This fun event celebrates cancer survivorship. Fifteen cancer patients were the stars of the show, and four staff\u2014including Chair of Surgery Jennifer Tseng, MD\u2014played supporting roles on the runway. A lively crowd cheered on the models as they showcased beautiful ensembles by eight local designers and stylists. Nourishing Our Community oston Medical Center (BMC) has transformed the roof of its power plant into a farm that grows more than 25 different crops and makes honey from two beehives. Since its creation in 2017, the farm has supplied fresh produce for the hospital's therapeutic food pantry, inpatient meal services, and cafeterias. Approximately 16% of BMC patients are food insecure. Physicians can write prescriptions for patients to visit the pantry twice a month. During the 2018 growing season, 5,688 pounds of tomatoes, peppers, greens, and many other vegetables were produced between April and November. A similar yield is expected when the 2019 season wraps up. The farm relies on farm manager\u2014aka farmer\u2014Lindsay Allen, a part-time assistant, a beekeeper, and hospital volunteers. Allen describes the bees, which provide pollination benets to the farm and to plants in the neighborhood as \"the unsung heroes of the food system.\" \"This initiative supports our mission to address social determinants of health by improving access to healthy fruits and vegetables, and is a perfect example of BMC's dedication to sustainability and green efforts,\" says David Maffeo, BMC's Senior Director of Support Services. It was Maffeo and Robert Biggio, Senior Vice President of Facilities and Support Services, who had the vision to transform the 7,000-square-foot space into a farm. Maffeo worked with Boston-based Higher Ground Farm to nd the right growing system, and another local business, Recover Green Roofs, designed and installed it. Some of the harvest makes its way to BMC's Teaching Kitchen, where Culinary Nutrition Manager Tracey Burg hosts free public classes using these fresh, seasonal ingredients. The sessions range from diagnosis-specic classes for people with diabetes and other common conditions to basics like making healthy dinners on a budget. A 2019 article about the farm in the American Journal of Public Health concluded, \"This novel model can be replicated by other organizations aiming to alleviate food insecurity, encourage healthy eating, and promote environmental sustainability.\" BLindsay Allen supervised production of more than 5,600 pounds of produce in 2018.Of Note BMC-003 Surgery Annual Report 2019_F.indd 21 9/13/19 2:20 PMBUSM/BMC Department of Surgery Annual Report 2019 22 SURGERY RESIDENCY PROGRAM Donald Hess, MD Associate Chair for Education, Program Director Luise Pernar, MD Associate Program DirectorTeviah Sachs, MD, MPH Associate Program DirectorLana Ketlere, Residency Program Coordinator SURGERY FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMS Surgical Critical Care Fellowship Tracey Dechert, MD, Program Director Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Fellowship Jeffrey Siracuse, MD, Program Director SURGICAL EDUCATION Douglas Jones, MD, Director PODIATRY RESIDENCY PROGRAM Hau Pham, DPM, Program Director David Negron, DPM, MBA, Associate Program Director SURGERY CLERKSHIP DirectorTejal Brahmbhatt, MD, Associate DirectorAbdul Saied Calvino, MD, Assistant Director, Roger Williams Medical Center Patrick B.

Led by Donald Hess, MD, the program provides residents with the range and depth of experience and academic exposure to develop superior surgical skills and to make mature, informed, independent judgments. Graduates of the program are well-prepared to become outstanding general surgeons or surgical specialists. The majority of residents pursue additional fellowship training after graduation, and many have gone on to assume leadership positions in academic surgery. The Surgery Residency Program is based at Boston University Medical Center, a modern, vibrant medical complex located in the heart of Boston's South End. The medical center includes Boston University School of Medicine, the Boston University School of Public Health, and the Boston University Goldman School of Dental Medicine, as well as Boston Medical Center. Our program leads to American Board of Surgery Certication within an environment designed to encourage clinical and basic scientic research experience. Residents interested in careers in academic surgery are encouraged to develop the necessary skills in research, education, and/or administration through a broad range of research fellowship opportunities. Clinical research is also encouraged among residents during their clinical years of training. In fact, most residents have contributed to at least one paper being published in a peer-reviewed journal by graduation, and many have given award-winning presentations (see Resident News, page 25). The principal goal of our program is clinical excellence. We believe that exposure to a large, diverse patient population and broad experience in complex open and minimally invasive surgery are essential elements in the training of outstanding surgeons. The department also has a unique program that links Boston University School of Medicine students who are interested in surgical research with resident mentors, who connect the students with faculty members conducting research in the students' areas of interest. This program provides residents with mentoring experience and has led to numerous award-winning presentations by medical students. 2019 Surgery Residency Graduates Olga Beresneva, MD Colorectal Surgery Fellowship,Lahey Hospital and Medical Center Christopher Graham, MD Surgical Critical Care Fellowship,Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Elica Inagaki, MD Vascular Surgery Fellowship,University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Andrew McChesney, MD Vascular Surgery Fellowship, Eastern Virginia Medical College Rumbidzayi Nzara, MD Minimally Invasive and Bariatric Surgery Fellowship, University of Maryland SURGERY RESIDENCY PROGRAM VIDEO Learn about the unique opportunities offered by the Boston University School of Medicine Surgery Residency Program by watching our informative online video.
