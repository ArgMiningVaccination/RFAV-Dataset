A: A vaccine allows your body's immune system to respond to an inactivated version of a virus or bacteria, creating antibodies and other protection specific to that invader before it ever has a chance to make you sick. With vaccines, you can protect your family from polio, tetanus, rotavirus, hepatitis A and B, whooping cough, chicken pox, measles, and bacteria that cause pneumonia and meningitis. There is even a vaccine now for a virus that causes cancer. Q: How are the COVID-19 vaccines different? A: The COVID-19 vaccines are recommended to prevent disease just like the rest of the vaccinations we recommend. It is important for as many people as possible to be vaccinated as it helps stop the fast spread of what can be a dangerous illness to some who contract the virus. There is a new technology that was used to produce some of the vaccines - mRNA vaccination - that we hope will also help us quickly and effectively produce future vaccines. Everyone who is eligible for the COVID-19 vaccination and boosters should be vaccinated to help our community. Q: How do I know which vaccines my child and/or I should receive? A: Your doctor is the best resource to help you decide what's right for you and your child. I encourage you to make an appointment with your primary care provider today to discuss any questions or concerns you might have, or to check and make sure your or your child's immunizations are up to date.
