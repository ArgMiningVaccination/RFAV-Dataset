Humanbeings will make important discoveries in the future in this respect. Theywill actually unite their moral-spiritual nature with the results of senseperception. An infinite deepening of the human soul can be foreseen inthis domain. 1 \u0097Rudolf Steiner Between the physical, sense-perceptible world and the world of spirit a chasm yawns. It is no physical chasm, yet aswe draw near to it, our inner experience is much like that wehave when standing at the very edge of a cliff. Dark emotionsthreaten to overwhelm all thinking, all other feelings, and wefeel paralyzed. In Rudolf Steiner\u0092s words: \u0093The soul may feelas though it were looking into an infinite, blank, desolateabyss. The feeling is something like fear and dread, and thesoul lives in it without being aware of the fact.\u0094 2 At first the spiritual world is so foreign, so \u0093other\u0094 that we do not sense its presence in any way, rather we only sensethe loss of the familiar, the emptiness everywhere, and feelthe fear that accompanies them. So we turn aside from thethreshold, often unconsciously. Cultivation of an active inner life through meditation places us regularly near the threshold. We begin to know andfeel the faithfulness of thinking, even in the void ofconsciousness that first embraces us. As the sense worldvanishes, the spiritual activity within thinking lives on andsustains us. As the objects of consciousness pass away, andsleep threatens to overtake us, the life of thinking radiatesits own vivifying, awakening force. We gradually learn to livewithin the shifting waters of a living, immaterial world,even if at first it remains dark and enigmatic. We are buoyedby the birth of our higher self in meditation, and itbecomes the firm spiritual center of our spiritual awakening.But parallel with the cultivation of an inner life, Rudolf Steiner also consistently emphasized another aspect tomeditation, one directed not inward but outward into thesense world. On various occasions, he contrasted the pathinward, into the soul, with the path outward into the senseworld, terming them the \u0093mystical\u0094 and \u0093alchemical\u0094 pathsrespectively. 3 Concerning the mystic path into one\u0092s soul, he indicated how difficult it can be to know if one is free of thedeceptions caused by Lucifer and Ahriman. 4 Try as we might to draw something from ourselves, it constantly suffers thedanger of being permeated with instincts. Steiner states itdramatically in his January 1924 lecture after the ChristmasFoundation Stone meeting: \u0093All that arises from within becomes impure. The time for such creation from within is over and gone.\u0094 5 By contrast, the outer path is more secure, even if the Imaginative experiences to which it leads are moredelicate and short-lived. Natural phenomena are a safe startingpoint for spiritual practice. In this lecture as elsewhere, Steinerspeaks of a practice that transforms outer sense experienceinto inner soul experience. We first fully engage the senseobject - the blue sky, the growing plant, or the human form,Breathing Light:A Yoga for the Senses Arthur Zajonc, Amherst, Massachusetts, USA Rudolf Steiner\u0092s Red Window of the Goetheanum. Illustration byVan James.2for example, but then we must go beyond these outer impressions. \u0093The movement caused by the external impression has finished, and for mostpersons that is the end of the matter. Thisis, however, where the pupil must take hisstart...\u0094 6 Having taken it in deeply, we then turn away from the external impression inorder to feel the moral echo or afterimagethat rises up within our souls. Precisely hereis the starting point for a new relationshipto the world, one that leads us beyond senseexperience towards the supersensible. Thenwill the sense processes have becomeensouled again, as Goethe and Steiner bothsought to accomplish, and a crossing pointto the spirit established. 7 Against this background, we understand why in How to Know Higher Worlds,Rudolf Steiner urges us again and again toturn our careful attention to the buddingand blooming of plants, or their dying anddecaying, to crystal, plant and animal.Likewise, we gain a new understanding ofhis Calendar of the Soul, which allows us toaccompany the passing seasons of the yearinwardly. In all these ways Rudolf Steinerdirects us to a health-giving dimension inmeditative life granted by the hand ofnature. Outer phenomena can thus provideus with a fine starting point for spiritualpractice, becoming a \u0093yoga of the senses.\u0094 I use this phrase quite consciously, because Steiner himself saw his book Howto Know Higher Worlds as a transformationof the traditional Eastern breathing practiceinto a cognitive breathing process. In 1917he said, \u0093All the exercises in the book Howto Know Higher Worlds are the spiritualcorrelate suited to the West, of that forwhich the Orient longs: to bring the rhythmof the process of breathing into the processof cognition.\u0094 8 Before the Mystery of Golgotha, potent beneficial forces lived within the air, or as theGreeks called it, pneuma, which meant bothair and spirit. We need only recall that it wasthe breath of God which awakened Adam.But since the Mystery of Golgotha the soulnature of air has changed, and so should ourmeditative practice. Christ lives now withinthe world of light, the etheric, and thus ourbreathing should take place within thatelement. We need to learn to \u0093breathe light,\u0094that is, to work at the level of cognition asdescribed above. If we do so, then we willbecome aware that beings of the rank ofangel dwell in every color and tone, in every sense impression. As Steiner says, \u0093When weopen our eyes and look around at every thingthat surrounds us affecting our senses, we arenot aware that our Angel dwells in the sun\u0092srays which penetrate our eyes, making objectsvisible. The beings of the Angeloi live inwaves of sound, in the rays of light and colorand in other sense perceptions.\u0094 9 Throughout his written and spoken work, Rudolf Steiner draws us toward the senseworld, to nature and the arts in order toestablish a new inner relationship to them.Particularly in the arts we work intimately withcolor, tone, movement and form. We graduallyunderstand in just what sense the arts are, asVirginia Sease has written, \u0093a bridge over theabyss, over the threshold into the spiritualworld.\u0092\u0092 10 Here especially we can find a fruitful basis for spiritual practice that leads to a higherconsciousness, one that can open for us theproximate world of the elemental beings andangels. 11 Many in the West have worked with breathing exercises, and have felt the benefitthese provide for their peace of mind andhealth. It is important to know that in theBuddhist canon, breathing was only one offorty standard subjects for meditation. Eightof them were sense subjects: earth, water,air, fire, and the colors blue, yellow, red andwhite. These kasinas, or \u0093devices,\u0094 were tobe meditated on by the Buddhist monk inmuch the same way that Rudolf Steinerdescribes the meditation on sense objects.By taking up only the breathing practice inthe West, we have selected only a fragmentof a much richer meditative tradition. In past meditative traditions, one often shut out the sense world, spending longperiods, even years, in isolation, withdrawninto oneself in order to reconnect with thelost world of spirit. Today, for mostWestern souls, a safer path can be foundthrough a practice that works with the lightof nature in which the Christ works andweaves. Here the arts, especially in theiranthroposophical forms, can be an enor-mous help. Few of us can or shouldwithdraw into a remote hermitage, but weall can benefit from a prolonged engagementwith the arts. Even today, Eastern practiceinvolves many long hours of sitting inmindfulness of the breath. I think that theproper metamorphosis of this sittingpractice is a Goethean-artistic mindfulnessof color, movement, tone, shape.... EveryBefore the Mystery of Golgotha, potentbeneficial forces livedwithin the air, or as theGreeks called it, pneuma , which meant both air and spirit. 3art offers us wonderful possibilities for practicing a yoga of the senses throughwhich we can learn to find themoral-spiritual in the sensory. After long practice, we will have learned how to unite our moral-spiritual nature withsense perception, and so have set out uponthe \u0093infinite deepening of the soul\u0094 thatSteiner foresaw. What appeared at first as asubjective and ephemeral impression of thesoul will then slowly become a new groundon which we can walk, one of living water.As He did to the apostle Peter, Christbeckons, and gives us the means to walk onthe lake of spiritual waters no matter howstormy the sea or tumultuous the air. Hebecomes the bridge over the abyss. Notes 1. Rudolf Steiner, \u0093Moral Experience of the Worlds of Color and Tone\u0094 in Art as Seen in the Light of Mystery Wisdom , January 1, 1915. 2.

Rudolf Steiner, The Spiritual Beings in the Heavenly Bodies and in the Kingdom ofNature , Lecture of April 3, 1912.(Based on talks by Reverend Robert Patterson, given in Lima, Peru, July 26, 1999 and ManfredSchmidt-Brabant, given in Honolulu, Hawai\u0092i,on June 15, 1996, as well as on conversationswith Rev. Erk Ludwig and Wolfgang Rommelconcerning the work of Rev. Dr. FriedrichBenesch). The human head can be compared to a microcosmic picture of the world. In a similarway the earth may be imaginatively viewed as amacrocosmic head. Rudolf Steiner says as muchin his spiritual scientific approach to geography.Following his lead one researcher has consideredtwelve major rivers throughout the world andlikened them to the twelve nerve streams of thehuman head. Another investigator hassuggested that the twelve earth nerves aretwelve mountain ranges that descend from theArctic Circle region in the north. It has also beenput forward that the Mediterranean Sea is like ahuge watery eye while the Himalayan mountainrange is a second, mountainous eye. The JordanRift, the deepest, open incision in the planetcreates a kind of facial axis or line of symmetrywith an indented nose between the liquid andsolid eyes. Living into such imaginations, unusual as they may be, can provide insights into theuniverse, the earth and the human being thatmight otherwise be difficult to approach. Rudolf Steiner suggested that after the departure of the sun from the earth (one couldalso say the expulsion of the earth from thesun), all the slowly solidifying continents of theearth were clustered together around Africa andpositioned near the North Pole. Known inearth science as Gondwana, this group-continent offset the larger southern part of anoblong planet. The earth was not yet solid andit rotated only slowly. As it began to cool onlytwo souls were able to incarnate into theinhospitable environment. Designated inJudeo-Christian tradition as Adam and Eve,these two souls were able to survive the earlyearth atmosphere but only in a subtle, ethericnature\u0097 in a special paradisal setting. When thesouthern, denser portion of the earth separatedoff to become the moon, the wound leftbehind by its departure\u0097the Pacific Basin\u0097washealed by the continents separating from eachother into independent organs, i.e. geographicbeings. The continents and by extension theSpiritual Geography Van James, Honolulu, Hawai\u0091i The human head can be compared to amicrocosmic picture ofthe world. 4 tectonic plates that support them express the earth\u0092s particular structure and form. The edgesor seams of the plates are warmer and moreactive than their centers. However, \u0093hot spots\u0094like Hawai\u0092i demonstrate shifting plates and adynamic living earth. Earth movements may be just as prevalent now as they were when the earth was soft. Afterthe 1964 earthquake in Alaska, Montague Islandwas raised twenty feet higher above sea level andoffshore depths were thirty feet lower. In 1812,an earthquake in mid-western North Americacaused church bells to ring in Boston. A lakeseven miles wide and twenty miles longappeared in Tennessee as a result of these earth movements. Krakatoa, Mount St. Helens, and numerous other examples of earth changeshave occurred in historic times. If one gazes at the face of the earth an interesting three-folding or division into threescan be seen. (Fig. 1) The Jordan Rift, thedeepest open trench in the world, geographicallydivides East from West, running through theDead Sea, the Red Sea, and continuing towardAntarctica as the East African Rift System. TheMarianas and Philippine Trenches are othervertical features in the earth descending to asmuch as 36,000 feet below sea level off the coastof eastern Asia. Running through the westernPacific Ocean along Japan and the Philippinesthey are part of what is called the Ring of Fire, ahot and active tectonic plate edge that encirclesthe Pacific basin. The third great geographicfeature of the earth\u0092s surface is the Rocky andAndes Mountain Ranges that run north/southalong the western side of the Americancontinents. Rather than descending to thedepths of the ocean or creating a vessel-likeopen trench they project skyward as some ofthe youngest major mountain ranges in theworld. An inverted tetrahedron of forces isformed by these three geographic lines of force.They direct magnetic energy to a point at the South Pole (fig.2). The Alps and the Himalayan ranges run east/west as if to intersect the three verticalstreams of force. If one imagines the westernRocky and Andes mountains as seen through atransparent earth, they form a great cross withthe Alps of the center and the Himalayas of theEast. A giant, geographic Cross of the World isformed. If one looks at the \u0093language\u0094 of land formations from West to center and East, thereis yet another three-folding that becomesapparent. The southern coastal areas of NorthAmerica, Europe and Asia, as they respectivelygesture toward South America, Africa andAustralia, have three prominent east/west landfeatures. In North America there are thepeninsulas of Baja California and Florida withMexico as a solid, large landmass in betweenthem. Europe has three peninsulas: theblockish Iberian Peninsula with Spain andPortugal, boot-shaped Italy, and the dispersedmainland and isles of Greece. Asia demon-strates a similar arrangement of transformingland areas with the solid, blockish ArabianPeninsula, then the pointed Indian subconti-nent, and further to the east the IndochinaPeninsula dropping down and dispersing into the islands of Indonesian (fig. 1). It is indeed striking how repeated three-fold gestures appearin these landforms with a general breaking up inan easterly direction. The Pacific region has its own tripartide character in the Polynesian Triangle, formed bythe extreme dispersal of the \u0093many islands\u0094 ofthe Pacific Ocean (fig. 3). Hawai\u0092i in the north,Aotearoa (New Zealand) in the southwest, andRapa Nui (Easter Island) in the east form thisgreat triangle of the Pacific. There are no largelandforms here, only the connecting elementsof water, air and light. Asia and the Americasflank the Pacific like two half moons creatingthe Ring of Fire and land boundaries aroundthis vast watery world. It has been suggestedthat China and Japan express the will characterFigure 1 Figure 25of this western Pacific region, while the Philippines and Southeast Asia are linked to thefeeling, and Australia and New Zealand tocognition. On the other side of the Pacific, Peruwould be connected to will, while CentralAmerica expresses the feeling element, andCalifornia cognition. There are five locations throughout the world where very old rock formations, theorigins of the continents, may be found (fig. 1,shading). There are also five etheric or formativeforce centers located in the various oceans. Theseetheric centers, which are directly linked to thesource of weather patterns (winds, currents,storms), are mobile and changeable but looselypositioned in the north Atlantic, the IndianOcean, and three centers in the Pacific (fig. 1,spirals). The North Pole, apart from its ice cap, is open to the cosmos. It is a water realm with nolandforms and acts as a fontanel\u0097open at thetop of the head. Antarctica, on the other hand,is closed, solid ground, a firm footing for theworld. It is the last of the continents to bediscovered, and it is the only continent to haveno indigenous peoples inhabiting it. In itssnowy and icy covering it is veiled in secrecy andmystery. Returning to the picture of the earth as a head, Europe and Africa may be seen as thecenter of the face with the Americas and Asiaand Australia on both sides like ears. Althoughthe British established Greenwich, England asthe Mean Time for their own convenience, thereis one researcher who feels the meridian linewould have been better set along the longitudeof Jerusalem, beside the Jordan Rift, at theplanet\u0092s esoteric middle. Although superficiallyseen as Euro-centric, this imagination of theearth with Europe in the center has a truesignificance. It also means that the dateline, at which one day becomes another, is where thecenter of the back of the earth-head would be,in the middle of the Pacific region. This area ofleast land on the planet contains two thirds ofthe earth\u0092s oceans. As the back of the head it isthe place of least awareness, least self-conscious-ness. It is also referred to as the Womb of theWorld, this place where the moon was born (fig3). Looking at North America, the New World, we see a land under great geological stress. It is aland out of balance, ill in a sense. Its people dieout and need to be continually replenished bypeople from elsewhere. North America willalways need new people for it is connected withdeath forces (Saturn). People of the west arepulled into the will by these forces and have thepotential for \u0093the highest spirituality.\u0094 At thesame time, this high spirituality may be in theform of the Ahrimanic, directed toward amechanistic and materialistic manifestation. Over the course of geological time sea levels in North America have risen no less than 150 times,driving the Gulf of Mexico up into the Missis-sippi River Valley and glaciers have come downfrom the north carving out the Great Lakes. Thischain of lakes and bays separating Canada from the US is the most complex fresh water system in the world. One spiritual geographer relatesplanetary influences to the Great Lakes. Accordingto him Lake Superior is linked to the planetaryforces of Jupiter, Lake Michigan to the Moon,Lake Huron to Mars and the Georgian Bay toSaturn, Lake St. Claire to the sun, Lake Erie toMercury, and Lake Ontario to Venus (fig.4) Thesewaterways and the mid-western region as a wholecan be seen as the rhythmic system, respiration and Figure 3 Figure 46circulation, the feeling realm of the continent. The Canadian Great Plains and the northern lakesregion might be a kind of sensory system, whilethe south\u0097Texas, Louisiana, Mexico, etc.\u0097couldbe the metabolic region of North America. Thisthree-folding of the continent from north to south can be extended east to west creating a cross current of forces (fig. 5). The east carries the nerveactivity and thinking pole of the continent whilethe west acts as the limbs and will. The east coastthat looks towards Europe is sinking while thewest coast that turns its back on the Pacific is rising.(Note how observations and designations fromdifferent points of view overlay one another withseeming contradiction. These observations ofNorth America should be seen alongside theearlier considerations of the earth as a whole,where America is more generally a land of will.) Humanity needs to experience itself once more as a spiritual organism within the contextof a whole. We must expand our consciousnessto embrace all regions of the earth as interdepen-dent and related to one another. The decisiveconception of East and West as polarities withan abyss between them must be re-enlivened,that a bridge may be built with heart forces forthe Soul of the World to span the gap in ourconsciousness. More than an economic globaliza-tion or a political New World Order is needed. Aspiritual revolution of human dimensions isrequired. To transform the earth we must startwith our own head, with our own thinking.As a practicing nutritionist, chiropractor, and student of Spiritual Science I have madea number of observations over the lastthirty years of private practice. The main health problems we are suffering from today are due to a lack ofproper food in our diets. The majority ofpeople I evaluate with health problems eatfrom a repertoire of twenty foods, theirwhole life. Many of these twenty foods weingest are refined, packaged, processed,denatured and are, basically, non-foodstuffs.Without the proper nutrients we are unableto regenerate new cells and the catabolic(breakdown) process increases, resulting in\u0093dis-ease\u0094 and dysfunction. There are more than 3000 fruits and vegetables on the planet to choose from. Asa rule, I recommend four fruits and fourvegetables a day, one to two servings ofanimal or vegetable protein, some healthyfats such as olive oil, cod liver oil or flaxseedoil, nuts, grains, seeds, sprouts and lots ofwater. Following this diet is not easy in ourfast-paced, hectic, tightly scheduled lives, butit is essential if we want to slow the agingprocess and stay healthy and productive.Diseases that once were related to old ormiddle age are occurring more frequently inyounger populations due to the increasingconsumption of refined, fast foods. OurWestern lifestyle is out of control andunfortunately has been exported all over theglobe thanks to McDonalds, Pizza Hut,Burger King and similar businesses. Many of the chronic lifestyle and degenerative diseases we experience on aphysical level, such as back pain, osteoarthri-tis, hypertension, diabetes or blood sugarproblems, cancer, strokes, myocardialinfarctions, Alzheimer\u0092s disease, poorposture, and obesity, not to mention thedepression, moodiness, hormone imbal-ances, lack of self esteem, lack of spiritualconnectedness, can be linked to a lack ofproper nutrition on many levels (physical,mental, emotional and spiritual). All ofthese conditions seem to be related to ourlifestyle choices and levels of stress, bothconscious and unconscious. Balancing Body Chemistry Preventing and Reversing ChronicDegenerative Disease by Means of Diet Dr. Michael R. Joseph, Honolulu, Hawai\u0091i Figure 57When I interview my clients about diet, their responses are strikingly similar. Inover 15,000 independent medical evalua-tions I have performed over the last 20years, I have seen a pattern in those clientswho did not heal. The pattern is rooted ina poor diet with limited food choices andan unhealthy lifestyle. Most people do notdrink enough water, which renders themdehydrated and constipated, with \u0093sludgy\u0094blood. The blood transports toxins alongwith the needed oxygen, nutrients, andhormones. If it is not at the right pH levelor consistency, dysfunction results. Heartdisease is one of the leading killers on theplanet, but it is not the heart that is theproblem. It is what is running through theheart, i.e., the blood that is out of balanceand which deposits, throughout thecardiovascular system, the residual toxins itis transporting. An article by Otto Warburg, who won the 1931 Nobel Prize for discovering thatcancer cells do not grow in an alkalineenvironment, came across my desk years ago.Warburg\u0092s view of environmental wellness isprimarily concerned with the internal milieuor the biological terrain. We are talking aboutthe internal garden that we grow our cells in,the fluid matrix within our veins, arteries,organs, glands, cells, nervous system, bones,brain, etc. Rudolf Steiner would call thismilieu the etheric formative forces. It matters what we put in our mouths to nourish and sustain our physical bodies. Inour culture of fast food and eating on therun, or not eating at all, we deprive ourbodies of proper fuel to sustain theadenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) cycle in themitochondria of our cells. (This is only one of many processes where we depriveourselves of proper fuel, but the ATP cycleis considered especially important because itmakes the energy to loco mote ). We are eating ourselves into chronic degenerative diseases,by taking in denatured, processed food-stuffs. We are compromising our well-beingby living in environmentally challengedspaces and not knowing how to live inaccordance with our own natural rhythms onthe physical, soul and spiritual levels. We aremuch more than this physical body, whereinwe feel pain, fatigue, depression, anddysfunction. Upon further clinical research it became apparent to me that people with chronicdegenerative diseases all have one thing incommon: their bodily tissues are too acidic. I knew that my swimming pool had to havethe right pH but it took me several years toassociate this with the human body. I beganto check the pH of my patients, and sureenough, those with chronic degenerativediseases also had acidosis. Those withprostate cancer, colon cancer, breast anduterine cancer, arthritis, gout, Alzheimer\u0092sdisease, diabetes, liver disease, hypertensionand heart disease, kidney disease resulting indialysis, multiple sclerosis, depression,hormone imbalances and the majority of theother chronic debilitating conditions Itreated, all had urine and saliva that was tooacidic. What would cause this kind of univer- sal problem in an advanced society such asours? The answer had to be the diet thesepeople were eating and the on-goingenvironmental, psychological, social,chemical and structural stressors. Inlooking at the responses of my clients overthe last 30 years of my holistic chiropracticand nutrition practice, it appeared to methat most people did not eat enough fruitsand vegetables, nor did they drink enoughwater. When they ate carbohydrates ordrank them, they ate refined ones. Theprimary offenders were white and wheatbread, pasta, white or brown rice, crackers,cookies, cakes, pies, alcoholic beverages,donuts, sodas, fried meats and chicken.These are all acid forming substances in thehuman body. As I looked into nutritionmore, I realized that it was the refinedfoods, the ones that were processedextensively, that fail to provide us with thenourishment of vitamins, minerals, andamino acids, the building blocks for ourhuman bodies! To change this acid condi-tion, we must eat more fruits and veg-etables, which will make our internal milieumore alkaline, drink alkalized water, andfind constructive ways to deal with ourstress-filled lives. One thing that became apparent to me early on is that there is only one personresponsible for my disease, me. We couldeach blame our parents up to the age of 15;unfortunately by then our habit body hastaken hold of our food choices and needs tobe altered. I came down with hepatitis at age28 and realized I had to take care of myself,especially my diet. It is not the easiest thingto do but it is very rewarding to be respon-sible for ones self.We are much more than this physical body,wherein we feel pain,fatigue, depression, anddysfunction. 8There are a few keys to staying healthy and preventing disease: 1. Drink 1/2 of your body weight in ounces of water a day, i.e. if you weigh 150 lbs. you need 75 ounces of water a day. If you sweat a lot or work outside, your need could increase to a gallon of water a day or more based on your body type and ability or desire toperspire. 2. Eat whole natural foods the way they grow in nature; organic is good,biodynamic is best. Make at least 4 fruits and 4 vegetables a day part of your basic diet. 3. Avoid any food that is not in its natural state, e.g., all refined and processed foods, frozen dinners, sodas, etc. I amnot saying to avoid them forever, but too many people make these their regular foods. We have an 80/20 rule atmy house to keep peace with our three children: 80% of the time we eat whole natural foods, 20% of the time we eatwhat our emotions dictate. The ratio becomes more like 90/10 as your taste buds adapt. 4. Food/herb based vitamins and minerals are a necessity today due to factory farming and depletion of vitalnutrients in the soils. We need supple- ments to help our bodies produce healthy cells and tissues. 5. Antioxidants, such as Vitamin C, are essential today. Take 3000 to 7000 Mg. daily; Vitamin E 400 to 800 IU daily;flaxseed, cod liver, or shark oil \u0096 2 tablespoons daily. 6. Remember that specific conditions require specific nutrients and natural remedies. Too many of us take NSAIDS, non-specific anti-inflamma-tory pills. They have side effects such as gastric irritation and ulcers; kidney and liver damage; allergic reactions, tinnitus,easy bleeding, and bruising; inhibition of cartilage repair and promotion of osteoarthritis. (I am referring to over thecounter drugs such as aspirin, ibupropen, and Tylenol etc.)Dr. Steiner did not offer a specific course in nutrition, yet many of his lectures offer a wealth of suggestions for maintaining homeostasis. His insights have stimulatedmany people to expand on the concepts of nutrition. Susan Johnson, M.D., an anthroposophical medical practitioner inpediatrics, offers a list of seven essential nutrients for healthy children. They include: 1) Warmth,2) Breathing, 3) Good Nutrition, 4) Sleep,5) Rhythms or daily rituals, 6) Harmonious movement, art and music and 7) Love, a feeling of connectedness. If these are good for children they are also beneficial for adults. Nutrition is so much more than taking in substances from the mineral (physical realm), the plant (etheric realm) and animal(astral realm) kingdoms. Most of our food comes from the plant realm. The majority of the world\u0092s population subsists by eatingonly food from the plant realm. \u0093Living plants are filled with forces that take the plant substance into spheres that are cosmicrather than earthly. Plant life is not possible without sunlight. In the plants, the minerals taken up depart from the earth. They aretaken in by forces radiating from all sides, from the extraterrestrial to the earth, and in the interaction of terrestrial and cosmicforces the plant originates. Man is involved with these etheric formative forces of the plants when he eats plant foods.\u0094 (RudolfSteiner, as quoted in Dynamics of Nutrition by Gerhard Schmidt, M.D.) The above is offered as food for thought, since there is so much more to nutrition than the food we eat.Man is involved with these etheric formativeforces of the plantswhen he eats plantfoods. 9Ten years ago, in the summer, two Australian travelers had an afternoon tea in an open-air tea house in Chengdu. They hadan unusual conversation with a young Chinese couple. The conversation inspired the Chinese couple to take teacher training atEmerson College in the UK and then to go to Sunbridge College in New York. The conversation has been written about in thebook Panda and Wandering Geese , published in Australia. The Australian travelers were Ben and Thanh Cherry, and the Chinese couplewas Li Zhang (Lily) and Huang Xiaoxing (Harry Wong). It was a seed of Anthroposophy and Waldorf education that Ben and Thanh planted in China ten years ago. The seed sprouted, grew and now starts to blossom,as a half dozen Chinese people have received training both in England and the United States. There are many more Chinese wholearned about Waldorf Education through the work of Ben and Thanh Cherry. After a long period of preparation, an initiative group is preparing to establish an Anthroposophical community including a Waldorf Kindergarten and a school (fromfirst to fifth grade) and a Bio-dynamic farm in Chengdu, Southwest China in the fall of 2004. Li Zhang (Lily), Huang Xiaoxing (Harry) and Zewu Li are the initiators of this project. There are a dozen people includingscholars, students and an educator who also are very active studying and working together in China. They will join the work to estab-lish a Waldorf school and Bio-dynamic farm in Chengdu this summer. Recently, a site was found for the school and kindergarten. Formerly a holiday resort with some farming land, it is located in the country about seven miles from the city ofChengdu. The property belongs to Zewu\u0092s aunt, a retired senior officer in a bank. She will rent it to the group at a very low cost sothat they can establish the school and kindergarten there. The resort consists of 35 small rooms and two large rooms and atypical country courtyard with a small gardenin the middle. It will be an ideal place to set up a kindergarten and a small school. The land that is attached to the property can potentially be used for Bio-dynamic garden-ing and farming. There will be at least six children enrolled in the Kindergarten and six children in thegrade school in the fall. The majority of children are from the families participating in our initiative work or from friends who arevery much interested in Waldorf Education. There will be two children in the first grade, two children in third grade, and two childrenin fourth/ fifth grade combined. There are potentially a dozen more children who may enroll in the kindergarten or the gradeschool. This will depend on how well the school is received by people in the surround- ing area. Li and Huang are the first people from China trained as Waldorf kindergarten and Waldorf elementary school teachers. Theyhave kept a close contact with China al- though they have been living in the west for nine years now . Many Chinese peoplelearned about Waldorf education through Huang\u0092s book, articles, and web site. His book is the first book in Chinese onWaldorf education, and was published by Guangdong Educational Press in mainland China and by Hong Kong Chinese Univer-sity Press in Hong Kong. Li and Huang currently are working at the Rudolf Steiner Fellowship Community in Spring Valley,New York. They have three children aged 8, 6, and 2, two of whom are attending Green Meadow Waldorf School. They are planningto move back to China and work with the group in China this summer. Meanwhile Li and Huang are busy writing fund-raisingproposals, forming a not-for profit corpora- tion in New York, and gathering books, teaching materials, and supplies in SpringValley. Zewu was a primary school teacher and completed Waldorf teacher training inEngland. He has a 9-year-old daughter. His wife is a music teacher in the primary school in Chengdu. They returned to China fromthe west last year. Zewu is introducing Waldorf education and Anthroposophy to those who are interested in Steiner\u0092s workDevelopments in China Harry Wong, Spring Valley, New York, USA Harry Wong\u0092s book on Waldorf Education is publishedby Guangdong EducationalPress and by Hong KongChinese University Press.10contributions from companies in the form of bribes. The government encouragesdeveloping private schools and colleges, but private schools have to adopt the state\u0092s curriculum and standardized examinations.The education department continually invents many strange evaluation methods, so schools have to force both teachers andchildren to put in extra hours working on endless exams. Children in both public schools and private schools are sufferingfrom the pressure of rigid, academic achievement. The school children are over burdened with the long school hours and frequent testing. The children have a lot of home- work every day and many children have extralessons on the weekends. Many parents and teachers are very unhappy with the current educational system in China, but they cannotdo very much about it because the system and the social setting are very powerful. Some people are, of course, looking foralternative education. There are many private schools in China now, but there are only very few alternative schools due to the politicalcontrols. This can be a fertile soil forWaldorf education, but it can be a hard ground to break through as well. There are parents who eagerly want to see a school of the kind Huang has de- scribed in his book. Such a school and kindergarten are expected to become real inChengdu this fall. Li, Huang and their group will manage with help to quietly start the work they have in mind. They will have towork very hard for integration of Waldorf education and Chinese culture and have to meet many obstacles in order to cope withthe educational authority. They will need a great deal of help and much support will be crucial to the future ofChina. Human resources and financial support are both greatly needed. Anyone who is interested in this development orwho wants to be a part of it, can contact Li and Huang (Harry) by email at: Harry@waldorfchina.org orlizhang@waldorfchina.org. See the website at: www.waldorfchina.org.through informal meetings. He translates books and writes articles about Waldorf Education. Meanwhile he is busy doing research in curriculum, legal questions andpotential development for the kindergarten and school. Eckart Loewe is a German Waldorf graduate who has been living in a small village in China for more than five years. He volunteers as a teacher in a very poor village.Chinese media have been interested in him for some years. Many people learned about Waldorf education through interviews withhim. He wrote a book in Chinese about his teaching experience, titled Working With the Nature of the Child , which was permeated with Waldorf educational ideas. Eckart plans to join the group to form the school this summer. Jiang Tao Zhao and Lei Li are parents who really wish to have a Waldorf Educa- tion for their children. They will bring theirchildren with them to join the group this summer. Zhu Ming, Xu Tian, Luo Jing and Wei He Hu are environmental educatorswho will work in the group practicing Bio- dynamic farming once the school is estab- lished. In general, the spiritual life is suffering in China while the economic life becomes better. The materialism has become verystrong after the weakening of economic socialism. Ahrimanic forces have taken hold of everything in China\u0097money is muchsought-after. It seems that this is the only thing that makes a person worthwhile, and its power fills the air. But, many people arestarved for spiritual life while the others pursue prosperity. All kinds of spiritual and religious life are hidden due to suppressionby the government. The government is suspicious of any kind of organization that carries an ideal other than materialism. Thereare seventy million Christians in China according to government figures, but possibly many more. The educational situation is very critical. There are some corrupt officials in the government who have been selling publicschools to private companies so that they don\u0092t have to continually support schools and teachers, and they can even collectThis can be a fertile soil for Waldorf education,but it can be a hardground to break throughas well. 11Nature Murals for Waldorf-Inspired ChildcareCentre Betty Khoo, Christmas Island, Australia In a city where nature is in short supply, one of the ways to bring \u0093Nature\u0094 to aChildcare center is to paint nature scenes onits walls. That\u0092s what Joyce Low, founder ofWhole Child Nurture Centre in Singapore,got a group of creative volunteers to do overa couple of weekends. The nature sceneswere inspired by vanishing wildlife in thetiny island-nation. Artistic license wasstretched a little but the children attendingthe Waldorf-inspired center should be ableto recognize snakes, snails and frogs, birdsand fish coiled, perched or swimming in themangrove swamp forest painted on pillarsand external walls. Joyce has attended quite a number of Waldorf education workshops and confer-ences\u0097in Darwin, New York, Hawaii andmost recently Kathmandu and Bangkok\u0097and is by now thoroughly familiar with thephilosophy and activities of Waldorf-Steinerinspired programs. In fact, the most recentworkshop she attended with two teachersworking now at the Whole Child nurturecenter was the 3-day Waldorf teacher trainingcourse conducted by Dr. Renata and otherWaldorf teachers in Bangkok in October2003. With such enthusiastic and experienced nurturers, Whole Child Nurture Centre iswell equipped to give its children outdoorplay time and gardening to experience natureand exercise limbs, have free play to encour-age imagination, and nurture the child\u0092ssenses through use of natural materials suchas cotton, wood and silks. There is also story telling and puppet shows, and the colorful festivals of multi-cultural Singapore (Chinese, Indian, Malayand Eurasian-Anglo-Europeans) are allcelebrated, as the year unfolds. This center in Kovan suburb is the second that Joyce has founded. The parentcenter Kampung Senang (meaning Villageof Ease in Malay), not only has had aWaldorf inspired child care program runningfor the past few years, but its main activity isa day care for the elderly and an after-schoolcare program for latchkey children. What is unique to both centers (whichare run as non profit organizations) are the organic food gardens. The fresh vegetablesand herbs from the gardens supplement theorganic-biodynamic imported foods andfruits that are prepared and served daily tothe elderly, students and staff of the centers. Volunteers plant out and maintain the organic food gardens, under the capable eye of chief volunteer James Low, Joyce\u0092s husband. The couple, who have two grownchildren, took early retirement from corpo-rate careers to start Kampung Senang, theonly care center in Singapore to meals(free of charge).

The year seems to havepassed in a whirlwind with so much growthand activity. Please note we have a new postaladdress: GPO Box 8975, EPC No. 4218,Kathmandu, Nepal. Our biggest news it that we completed our BMZ/ISIS/Freunde derErziehungskunst construction project in earlyNovember 2003. We now have three wonder-ful new classrooms, a new kitchen and ourvalley has protection from landslides. Webegan our first Class 3 on April 14, 2004. Theclassroom has been built, furnished andequipped, and the new teacher, NirmalaGurung has been training with us since thispast August. There is now a teacher training room and library with many books on Waldorf educa-tion and Himalayan culture and art. In December the children attended an eye and dental camp. The eye camp was conductedby the Seva Sight Program jointly supportedby the Seva Foundation of Berkeley, Califor-nia, and the Seva Service Society of Vancouver,Canada. The dental camp was conducted andsupported by the Himalayan Dental ReliefProject. We are so very thankful for thismedical support! We would like to thank all of our child sponsors for their invaluable and ongoingcommitment to the children in 2003. We stillhave a challenge to find child sponsors for 15children who currently attend the school andanother 15 children who will join us in thecoming year. Thanks to the many communities who provided warm winter clothing: The ISISFoundation in Bermuda, the Wolfrum Familyin Germany; Macandrew Bay Primary Schooland Kathmandu in New Zealand, and Class 2of the Minnesota Waldorf School in America.Our thanks to Healtheries of New Zealandfor the much needed donation of vitaminsand to Crown Removals and Mondaile forshipping the vitamins to Kathmandu. Wethank Pine Hill Waldorf School for thebeautiful toys and puppets. We would also like to deeply thank Catriona Matheson from New Zealand whohas spent the last three months with us inKathmandu teaching music and helpingchildren with special needs. Catriona alsofundraised for the donations of clothes and vitamins from New Zealand and has been oneof our child sponsors since we first started theschool. We are so grateful for her ongoingsupport and concern on every level for thechildren at the school. We have so very much to be grateful for and send our best wishes and heartfelt thanksto each of you and your families. We justcouldn\u0092t keep going without your Australia, 3rd - 8th July 2004 The children of today have wrapped as seed within them the world of tomorrow.How that world will manifest depends on theextent to which the potential within eachindividual can be released to allow destiny\u0092sfulfillment. Today\u0092s children are often veryawake and very sensitive. We see how hard it isfor them to properly take hold of their bodies\u0096 and this has consequences throughout theirlives. Children are being born with strongindividualities and sometimes strong one-sidedness. How do we understand this child of today? How do we manage the child in theclassroom? To celebrate the individuality ofeach child we have to extend our ways ofunderstanding the child. Different childrenlearn in different ways and have different socialneeds. How all these are woven together in aclassroom is a challenge for the teacher; how towork as a parent, a therapist or a counsellor insupporting these children \u0096 these are allchallenges that lie behind this regional Koliskoconference. Rudolf Steiner appeals to the teacher to recognise that \u0093the task of education conceived in a spiritual sense, is to bring the soul-spirit into harmonywith the life-body.\u0094 How can we observe whether the individuality of the child is taking hold ofthe life-body? When does a child need to see atherapist? What resources does the teacher needto help each child achieve this awakening of thespirit in the body?There is now a teacher training room and librarywith many books onWaldorf education andHimalayan culture andart. 13World Social Forum January 16- 21, 2004 Nesco Grounds, Goregaon, Mumbai, India Aban Bana, Mumbai, India It takes Dilnawaz and me an hour and a half to travel by local train and public bus fromwhere we live in south Mumbai to the venue ofthe World Social Forum in Goregaon, a suburbin north Mumbai. As we enter the NescoGrounds, a sea of banners with slogans greetsus: \u0093Let us join hands to make a communistworld \u0093Why zone peace\u0094, \u0093SupportDemocracy in Burma\u0094, \u0093Africa is not for sale!\u0094\u0093When Bush comes to shove, resist!\u0094 \u0093Qualitymen support equality for women.\u0094 We makeour way to our stall, where our banner has beenput up: \u0093Anthroposophical Initiatives in Indiaand the School of Spiritual Science,Goetheanum, Switzerland\u0094. Soon we meet ourfriends from Germany and Dornach. We havearrived at the World Social Forum. The WSF is the response of a growing global movement against neo-liberalisation andprivatisation, repression, violence and war. Themovement is supported by members of thecivil society and NGO\u0092s that care for theunderprivileged minorities, the downtroddenand the displaced. On the WSF grounds thereare no neon signs advertising Coca Cola and nomachines vending Nescafe. At this megainternational event, India is unbranded. Thetheme of this year\u0092s World Social Forum is\u0093Another World is Possible\u0094. Another world inwhich there is justice, where there is peace;another world in which human beings of allraces and all genders have their basic rights andcan live in dignity. Ulrich Roesch in Dornach and myself in Mumbai have been busy for the past fewmonths preparing our group\u0092s representation atthis very special event, where over 100,000people from 114 countries are participating. Theopening ceremony, with song and dance, hadspeeches by some well known social activists likethe author Arundhati Roy, Jeremy Corbin, andthe Nobel peace prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, allof whom encouraged the listeners to tackle theirproblems with courage and conviction. Onsubsequent days there were hundreds ofseminars and workshops on a variety of topicslike gender discrimination, bonded labour,The healing potential of Waldorf education and the world of wisdom that itencompasses is the wellspring that will sustainteachers in the deepening of their work andunderstanding of the child. The medical/therapeutic pictures can give insight into whatindividual children bring as questions forparents, teachers, and those who work withthese children as practitioners.

Inthe numerous halls people sat in groups all daylong discussing the many problems that plagueour society and trying to find long-termsolutions. There is a great deal of idealism, goodwill and compassion, and we feel ourselvesprivileged to be a part of this group of strivinghuman beings who really care for others and areinvolved in such selfless work, born out of agenuine feeling of brotherly/sisterly love. Outside the halls there was a great deal of song and dance and music, and cheerfulsloganeering in the streets and on stage. Therewere folk dances, parades and street playsaddressing many different social issues. Thesheer variety of people was mind-boggling. Notonly were various countries of the worldrepresented, but also all the states and languagesof India. The people dancing in the streets ormarching in the parades were monks fromTibet, refugees from Bhutan, trade unionmembers from Bangladesh, pacifists fromPakistan eager for friendly ties with India, as wellas tribals and Dalits (low-caste or outcastes),landless labourers, homosexuals and lesbians,prostitutes and Hijras (transvestites or eunuchs)from India. All were there with a sense of pride,determined not to let the system get the betterof them, hopeful of a better future, if not forthemselves then at least for their children. Formany foreigners, this was their first encounterwith the Indian caste-system. Many had neverheard the word Dalit before. They were indeedshocked to discover that in our day and age aperson can still be discriminated against onaccount of his or her birth. All around the huge grounds were over a thousand stalls of NGO\u0092s, advertising theiractivities through pictures and leaflets, sellingeco-friendly products and engaging the visitorsin lively conversation. At our Anthroposophi-cal stall, we had various books, leaflets, postersillustrating the initiatives in India and tee-shirtswith a very original design. TheAnthroposophists from India and fromabroad jointly led the daily events. On the firstday the opening and the key-note lectures weredelivered by Ulrich Roesch and Aban Bana,followed by the launch of the book \u0093Visionand Action for Another World\u0094 edited byUlrich and published by Earthcare Books,India. On the following day, Nirmala Diaz gave a talk on new pedagogical projects as representedby the Sloka Waldorf School in Hyderabad,followed by an account of the Tridha Rudolf Steiner School in Mumbai by Patrick Brillant.Medha Tengshe from Sadhana CamphillVillage near Pune spoke about CurativeEducation and Social Therapy in India. Theevening ended with a puppet show by thetrainees of the Tridha Steiner EducationSeminar and a classical by Manasi,teacher Dilnawaz ofSloka, in silent evening endedwith the whole audience doing EVOE inEurythmy. The third day saw the launch of a booklet on \u0093Eurythmy Exercises for Jet Lag\u0094 and abook \u0093Meetings with Anthroposophy,\u0094 by had Dr.Christoph Strawe and Ulrich Morgenthaler,both from Stuttgart, speaking on very impor-tant social issues. Unfortunately, three of ourspeakers were unable to come to WSFMumbai: BD Cotton project spoke onBioDynamic Agriculture. The events came to anend with a discussion \u0093The New World isUnfolding\u0094. And indeed it is, considering thespiritual and universal message of Dr. RudolfSteiner\u0092s Anthroposophy. The World SocialForum is of great importance because thevoiceless can be heard and maybe some day thepower of Love will overcome all the hatred anddespair and misery and make this world ofours truly happy and beautiful.There is a great deal of idealism, good will andcompassion... Book Reviews Shaping Globalization Civil Society, Cultural Power and Threefolding by Nicanor Perlas New Society Publishers, 2003. $17.95, 274 pages. This book is original in the same way that Small Is Beautiful was original, but without the catchy title. The author has the nerve to notonly attack the world-dominating corporategiants but also to propose an entirely fresh wayof thinking about how to contain them. Perlas jumps off from the Battle of Seattle, in which the forces of \u0093elite globalization\u0094 andthe WTO were thwarted by to be silent and impotent. It will not cede the worldto the economic sector, with its market valuesthat enshrine competition as if it were areligious dogma, nor to the political sector,democratic in theory but in fact dominated bypowerful corporations. The events in Seattle demonstrated how \u0093cultural jamming\u0094 can draw attention to aproblem. But new social forms and viablealternatives must be generated to replace what isnow dysfunctional. To address the totalitariantendencies of elite globalization, Perlas proposesthreefolding, a conscious balancing of theinterests of the three great spheres of society\u0097economy, polity, and culture. This process beginswith the realization that all three sectors arelegitimate, and they all need to be mobilized. Wedare not neglect the cultural sphere, the source ofvalues, purpose, and meaning for society. Itincludes the realms of ideas, religion, art,education, and the conscience and consciousnessof a people. Perlas insists that representatives ofthis sphere be at the table as equal partners. For the resurgence of this third sphere, which he refers to as \u0093civil society,\u0094 Perlas looksto the groups that his friend Paul Ray dubbedCultural Creatives. These include innumerableNGOs, alternative lifestyle people, theZapahstas in Mexico, socially responsibleinvestors (with assets of over a trillion dollars),and countless others who challenge the statusquo. Perlas shows how Cultural Creatives havecome together as a unified force in his country,the Philippines, and how the resulting picturecan be transferred to a world canvas. The book also examines how threefolding has begun to manifest in certain globalorganizations and UN agencies, by givingexamples of local and national trisectorpartnerships that are already working, andillustrating how to distinguish authentic fromcosmetic threefolding. While not as readable as Schumacher or Ray, Perlas\u0092s book, like theirs,helps to launch a new paradigm that couldmake a world of difference. \u0097Christopher Nye, Orion Magazine , November/December 2003 Spirit and Art: Pictures of the Transformation of Consciousness by Van James Anthroposophic Press, 2002. $30, softcover, 267 pages and over 300illustrations in b/w and color. ISBN 0-88010-497-X According to Van James, art is something like a midwife, helping to bring into the worldof sense perception \u0093our experience of theinvisible.\u0094 Spirit and Art is a detailed, richlyillustrated examination of art\u0092s power tosymbolize unseen spiritual processes and toreveal the evolution of human consciousness. Ranging from the cave art and megalithic structures of prehistory to the post-modernworld of Joseph Beuys\u0092s shamanic conceptualart, James explores the art and architecture ofEurope, ancient Greece and Rome, Egypt, theNear and Far East, Africa, Australia, and theAmericas. He includes chapters on sacredbuildings, art and the initiatory practices ofancient mystery cults, and spiritual designs andsymbols. Writing that artistic symbolism is an\u0093initiatory revelation that opens a doorway intothe secret realm of creation,\u0094 James offersnumerous crosscultural examples of images andstructures designed to draw human beingsdeeper into the mystery of catacombs,mandalas, labyrinths, Native American James also discusses \u0093Cosmic Script,\u0094 simple linear and geometric images, such as dots, circles,crosses, zigzags, and triangles, occurring as spiritualforms across numerous cultures, especially in thepetroglyphs of early humans.

International Postgraduate MedicalTraining for Doctors Gl\u00f6ckler, MD. Medical Section GoetheanumDornach, Switzerland Biodynamic Agriculture Training Program Anand, Gujarat, India December 1 to 6, 2003 Aban Bana, Mumbai, India Ten years ago Peter Proctor came for the very first time to India from his native NewZealand. Mr. T.G.K. Menon of Indore hadinvited Peter to share his knowledge and know-how of Bio Dynamic Agriculture with farmersin India. In those days the only B. D. Agricul-ture initiatives in India were the Maikaal CottonProject near MHOW and the Makaibari TeaEstates near Darjeeling. Peter began in realearnest with the task of spreading the messageof B.D. Agriculture throughout India.Together with his life-partner Rachel Pomeroy,he spends a few months each year travellingthousands of miles in India, from Assam toGujarat, from Tamil Nadu to Uttaranchal,giving courses, advising farmers, transforminghundreds of acres of poisoned land intohealthy, B.D. farms, increasing the bio-diversityof the flora and fauna.Peter\u0092s enthusiasm is catching, his commit- ment is complete. He helps Indian farmers torealise that Dr. Rudolf Steiner\u0092s AgricultureCourse held in Koberwitz, Germany, in 1924,contains the wisdom which was still alive inancient India, and is now experiencing a revival. Bhaikaka Krishi Kendra is a B.D. Farm outside Anand city in the state of Gujarat. Itis owned by Mr. Sarvdaman Patel, one of themost successful B.D. farmers in the country,and his wife Meena, a landscape artist of greattalent. Their farm is situated in the mostverdant landscape, with a great variety ofexotic birds and small animals everywhere.The farm has 40 milk cows. The great varietyof fruit, vegetables, flowers, timber trees andbamboo speak for the good work that is donehere. On this farm, Peter and Rachel gave aone week biodynamic training programme.The coordinator of this training is theBiodynamic Association of India co-workerMrs. Kamini Sheth, a lovely American ladymarried to an Indian and speaking fluentGujarati. They own a B.D. Farm near Diu. The participants at the training course were not only farmers, but also people fromall walks of life. Some had never touched cow-dung before! The day began before sunrise with a nature walk. Peter started the lessons with the day\u0092sverse by Dr. Steiner. This was followed byEurythmy with Dilnawaz Bana. Peter gave themain lectures, introducing B.D. Agriculture,assisted by Mr. Patel. Rachel spoke aboutCosmic Rhythms and led the star-watchingsessions every night before dinner. Oneimportant feature about this training coursewas that after each introductory talk, theparticipants did practical work like making acompost heap, creating new Cow Pat Pit,preparing liquid manure, tree-trunk pasting aswell as burying cow horns to make thepreparations. Everyone worked hard, even theelegant ladies in their flowing dresses anddelicate footwear and the gentlemen in their citytogs! The food served at the course was excellent B.D. quality, pure vegetarian anddelicious, a great variety and a new surpriseeach day! It is really amazing how much one can learn in less than a week. We are most gratefulto Peter and Rachel for their untiring efforts inspreading the message of Bio DynamicAgriculture in India.

Their dedication wasrewarded earlier this year, when Kona PacificSchool\u0092s brand-new campus opened itsclassroom doors. Connie Young, one of thefounding parents, who currently serves as aboard member and violin teacher, says,\u0093One of the basic philosophies of Waldorfeducation is learning how to work incommunity. One of the things we\u0092ve learnedis how much a small community canaccomplish when we celebrate that commu-nity spirit as we go about our work.\u0094 \u0093Kona Pacific School is one of several \u0091initiatives\u0092 of Kona Pacific Institute, whichis developing an educational center on 40acres of fertile farm land mauka of KonaCommunity Hospital in Kealakekua. Theschool shares the land with Kona PacificFarm, a biodynamic farm with plans todevelop a member supported vegetableprogram and a teaching center for biody-namic agriculture. At Kona Pacific School,the curriculum includes aspects of gardeningand farming and the children make frequentvisits to the farm to help tend the neat rowsof vegetables and four dairy cows. \u0093While Kona Pacific School has just graduated its first 8 th grade class this year, Malamalama Waldorf School, located inHawaiian Paradise Park, can point to theachievements of its graduates who go on toexcel in high school and college as confirma-tion of the Waldorf educational philosophy.This year, the three of Kea\u0092au\u0092s sixsuma cum laude graduates. AnotherMalamalama graduate won top honors inscience at Kea\u0092au High and won the regionalscience fair this year.\u0093\u0092All of our graduates have returned to the school at some point to do volunteerwork,\u0092 says Paulette L. Smith, the school\u0092soffice manager. \u0091Waldorf education producesnot only excellent students, but also caringcitizens.\u0092 \u0093Malamalama Waldorf School is, this year, celebrating their 25 th anniversary. Besides providing a well-rounded education,the school\u0092s facilities, including a spaciousfestival hall, are also used by a number ofcommunity groups for meetings andevents.\u0094 See more informa-tion. The La'a Kea Foundation:Mayor of Maui Pledges Land An exciting partnership has developed between the La\u0092a Kea Foundation andMayor Arakawa of Maui. Working with thecounty council, Mayor Arakawa has sug-gested a piece of property ideal for aresidential community with adults in needof special care. This beautiful property (seephoto) overlooks the site of the worldwindsurfing championships and is acrossthe street from a public gymnasium, so it iswell situated for participation in the flowof life. A proposal is now being developedfor the 12 acres of undeveloped formersugar cane land, to create a life-sharingcommunity with the possibility of futureexpansion on adjacent farm acreage.
