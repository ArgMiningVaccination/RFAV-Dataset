Summaries Of The News: [ CDC Loosens Mask Guidance For Most People In Dramatic Shift ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/cdc-to-loosen-mask-guidance-to-adjust-to-new-phase-of-pandemic/) Under new guidance released by the Biden administration Friday, about 70% of the American population could consider skipping masks in indoor public settings. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky emphasized that the covid situation could shift again but that \"we want to give people a break from things like mask wearing when our levels are low, and then have the ability to reach for them again should things get worse in the future.\" [ AP: CDC: Many Healthy Americans Can Take A Break From Masks ](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-science-health-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-87d7bdc811ba6521e32017072d5ea180) Most Americans live in places where healthy people, including students in schools, can safely take a break from wearing masks under new U.S. guidelines released Friday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outlined the new set of measures for communities where COVID-19 is easing its grip, with less of a focus on positive test results and more on what's happening at hospitals. The new system greatly changes the look of the CDC's risk map and puts more than 70% of the U.S. population in counties where the coronavirus is posing a low or medium threat to hospitals. Those are the people who can stop wearing masks, the agency said. (Johnson and Stobbe, 2/25) [ Stat: CDC Issues Long-Awaited New Guidance On When To Wear Masks ](https://www.statnews.com/2022/02/25/cdc-issues-long-awaited-new-guidance-on-when-to-wear-masks/) The new system moves beyond sheer numbers of new cases to look at how well the health care system in each county is holding up. The idea, the CDC said, is to focus on minimizing severe disease and ensuring that hospitals are able to cope with Covid cases while still delivering standard care. The designations will be based on key metrics at a county level, using data counties provide to the CDC on an ongoing basis. Those include the rate of Covid cases that require hospitalization and the percentage of beds in hospitals that are occupied by people who have Covid. If immunity from vaccination or prior infection holds and fewer people who contract Covid develop severe disease, more counties would move into the low-risk designation. But if a new variant emerges that causes more severe illness, rising hospitalizations would trigger a return to a recommendation to wear masks. (Branswell, 2/25) [ NBC News: CDC: Indoor Masking No Longer Necessary Across Most Of The U.S ](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-indoor-masking-no-longer-necessary-us-rcna17686) It's a dramatic shift from the previous guidance, which recommended masks in counties with substantial or high transmission, a category that covered the vast majority of the country. The recommendations apply to everyone, not just those who are vaccinated or have received a booster shot. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a briefing Friday that the change reflects that the overall risk of severe disease from Covid is lower because of widespread immunity provided by vaccines or prior infection, improvements in testing, and accessibility to new treatments. \"We're in a stronger place today as a nation with more tools to protect ourselves,\" she said. (Lovelace Jr. and Edwards, 2/25) [ Politico: CDC Relaunching Covid Tracker With An Eye On Eased Mandates ](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/02/24/cdc-relaunching-covid-tracker-eased-mandates-00011680) Under the agency's current case-centric formula, just 3 percent of the country is not experiencing the \"moderate,\" \"substantial,\" or \"high\" Covid-19 transmission that requires strict health measures. But that approach was developed before vaccines and treatments were widely available that have sharply diminished the risk of severe disease for most Americans. The new metrics, by contrast, will place more weight on whether a Covid-19 outbreak risks overwhelming local hospitals \u2014 and less on the number of individual infections. That shift will mean roughly 20 percent of the country can now pull back on mask mandates and social-distancing limits, one senior administration official said. (Cancryn and Owermohle, 2/24) But has behavior changed and will many people still wear masks to protect themselves and others?

About two-thirds of the roughly 9,000 respondents said they wanted the precautions to contain the virus, according to the poll, which was co-sponsored and published by the Los Angeles Times on Thursday. The views diverged according to political affiliation: While about 85% of Democrats backed vaccine mandates for schools about 70% of Republicans opposed them.

In New Hampshire, schools will no longer be allowed to mandate masks. \"I don't think this should be viewed as a drastic change or measure, it's just kind of another step forward as we continue to return to the old normal,\" Gov. Chris Sununu said. \"We know that masking can be a very powerful tool in times of surging transmissibility, but it obviously has drawbacks, especially for kids in schools and those with disabilities.\" (Musto, 2/24) Also \u2014 [ KHN: The Stress Of Restaurant Work Is Reaching A Boiling Point.

The state's Department of Health, which Ladapo leads, is now recommending that businesses should stop requiring employees to wear masks. The department is giving doctors a way to complain to state regulators if healthcare facilities don't approve of their treatment plans for COVID-19 patients. And the state says Floridians can stop isolating and reappear maskless in public five days after testing positive for the virus \u2014 as long as they have no fever and their symptoms are improving.

The lawsuit, which names Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall as a defendant, alleges that the service employs a double standard when approving exemption requests that favors medical and administrative exemptions. The plaintiffs are asking the court to declare the mandate unconstitutional, and bar the Air Force from taking \"enforcement/punitive action\" against them while the case is underway. (Williams, 2/24) [ The Texas Tribune: Texas Foster Children Have Been Allowed To Refuse COVID-19 Vaccines ](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/02/24/texas-foster-care-children-covid-vaccinations/) Over a thousand Texas foster children \u2014 some as young as 5 years old \u2014 have been allowed to refuse a COVID-19 vaccine, despite not typically being allowed to make their own medical decisions, according to a new report from protective services watchdogs. Around 40% of the foster children in the state's care who are 5 and older have not received a COVID-19 vaccine despite being eligible. This is due, in part, to guidance from the Department of Family and Protective Services that \"may be confusing,\" leading to caseworkers unnecessarily \"querying even very young children as to whether they would agree to vaccination,\" court-appointed monitors say. Nearly half of those children have been identified as having medical needs, meaning they could more easily contract COVID-19.

The two-dose vaccine, which uses an adjuvant from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) to boost immune response, is the sixth COVID-19 shot to receive regulatory clearance in the country. The Quebec-based privately held company has an agreement to supply up to 76 million doses of the vaccine to the Canadian government. Medicago said on Thursday it was committed to fulfilling the order as soon as possible. (Khandekar, 2/24) [ AP: Canada Authorizes First Plant-Based COVID-19 Vaccine ](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-science-business-health-canada-c2d5bcd7a69b14d5d037aca4b76430b4) Canada has become the first country to authorize use of a plant-based COVID-19 vaccine. Canadian regulators said Thursday Medicago's two-dose vaccine can be given to adults ages 18 to 64, but said there's too little data on the shots in people 65 and older. The decision was based on a study of 24,000 adults that found the vaccine was 71% effective at preventing COVID-19 \u2014 although that was before the omicron variant emerged. Side effects were mild, including fever and fatigue. (2/24) [ 54% Of US Abortions Happen By Pill, Not Surgery ](https://kffhealthnews.org/morning-breakout/54-of-us-abortions-happen-by-pill-not-surgery/) The AP and the New York Times report on new data showing the figure has risen from 44% in 2019, and note pill-based abortions are less expensive and obviously less invasive. In Arizona, a Republican helped to defeat an abortion pill ban. And Texas' strict anti-abortion law is again in the news. [ AP: Over Half Of U.S. Abortions Now Done With Pills, Not Surgery ](https://apnews.com/article/abortion-science-health-medication-56972af9e9b0fc2fc97e06041f6e96ce) More than half of U.S. abortions are now done with pills rather than surgery, an upward trend that spiked during the pandemic with the increase in telemedicine, a report released Thursday shows. In 2020, pills accounted for 54% of all U.S. abortions, up from roughly 44% in 2019. The preliminary numbers come from the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights. The group, by contacting providers, collects more comprehensive abortion data than the U.S. government. (Tanner, 2/24) [ The New York Times: Abortion Pills Now Account For More Than Half Of U.S. Abortions ](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/health/abortion-pills-us.html) The increase in medication abortion is most likely the result of several factors. The method \u2014 which is less expensive and less invasive than surgical abortions \u2014 had already become increasingly common before the coronavirus pandemic, driven partly by restrictions from conservative states that imposed hurdles to surgical methods, especially later in pregnancy. As of 2017, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which collects data by contacting every known abortion provider in the country, nearly a third of clinics offered only medication abortion. In 2019, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which did not include California, Maryland and New Hampshire, pills accounted for 42 percent of all abortions \u2014 and 54 percent of abortions that were early enough to qualify for medication because they occurred before 10 weeks' gestation.

This hearing before the nine-justice high court is an interim step in the ongoing federal lawsuit brought by abortion providers trying to challenge the law. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals asked the Texas Supreme Court to weigh in on a question of state law before the appeals court proceeds with its own ruling in the case.

The clinics are suing over a law, known as SB8, that went into effect Sept. 1 and bans abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. It allows private citizens to sue anyone who performs and assists a woman in obtaining an abortion after embryo cardiac activity is detected.

Colorado and Oklahoma clinics saw some of the biggest surges in Texas abortion seekers, the organization said. Between September 1 and December 31, 2021, abortion patients with Texas zip codes made up more than half the total number of patients at Oklahoma Planned Parenthood clinics, in what was a 2500% increase in Texas traffic to those facilities. Texas patients amounted to less than 10% in Oklahoma clinics the same time the year before.

The bill that unexpectedly failed would have eliminated the choice used by half of the people who have abortions in the state, leaving a surgical procedure as the only option. \"Members, I am about as pro-life as they come,\" Rep. Michelle Udall of Mesa said as she joined all Democrats in voting against the measure. \"However, in my research of some of these medications, they are used for other purposes as well.

Wade, which established the right to the procedure, activists are arguing about how best to proceed. The Biden administration has thus far avoided much mention of the divisive issue, while anti-abortion forces disagree on whether to try to ban abortion at the state level in a single step, or more gradually. Meanwhile, millions of Americans who have been covered by the Medicaid program since the pandemic struck are at risk of losing that coverage when the federal government ends the declared covid-19 \"public health emergency,\" likely later this year.

Republicans approved the measure in a 16-12 party-line vote on Thursday. It's a scaled back version of an earlier proposal that failed in a Senate committee, which would have banned a broader array of gender-affirming health care, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy. Advocates for transgender youth say decisions about health care should be left to children, their parents and their doctors.

Both pieces of legislation \u2014 commonly referred to as the \"individual freedoms\" (HB 7) and \"don't say gay\" (HB 1557) bills \u2014 have been widely lauded by conservatives across the state as a way to give parents more control over what their children are taught in school and what services they receive.

It also concluded that the largest percentage of tenants receiving pandemic aid were Black followed by households. In the fourth quarter of 2021, Treasury found that more than 40% of tenants getting help were Black and two-thirds of recipients were female-headed households.

Standing outside of the Maine State House on Wednesday, Brendan Holmes said Misty Brook Farm in Albion pulled its dairy products from store shelves two weeks ago after high levels of the \"forever chemicals\" known as PFAS were found in the farm's milk. Holmes said the contamination was traced to hay purchased from a neighboring farm that was fertilized with sludge in the past. So he joined several speakers urging the Legislature to pass a bill banning the once-common practice of spreading treated municipal sludge on fields as well as the sale of compost made from sludge.

Officials say that those who tested positive will still be advised to stay at home for at least five days. But from Thursday they are not legally obliged to do so, and those on lower incomes will no longer get extra financial support to make up for a loss of income due to isolation.

It was the second time this week that Elizabeth, 95, had canceled virtual sessions. However, she spoke by telephone with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday in what was seen as an encouraging sign of her recovery. The monarch's age, COVID-19 diagnosis and a health scare last year have caused worry among officials and the public.

The Biden administration has thus far avoided much mention of the divisive issue, while anti-abortion forces disagree on whether to try to ban abortion at the state level in a single step, or more gradually. Meanwhile, millions of Americans who have been covered by the Medicaid program since the pandemic struck are at risk of losing that coverage when the federal government ends the declared covid-19 \"public health emergency,\" likely later this year.

The tech industry has raced to fill consumer demand. A flood of new health-tracking wearables, monitors, tests and apps\u2014more than 350,000 apps, according to health research firm IQVIA\u2014promise to help people screen, monitor or flag all sorts of maladies and conditions, with or without a doctor's orders. Some of these healthcare tools have proved helpful, but consumers also report experiences with at-home lab tests that have been disappointing, confusing or misleading. Tools like sleep-tracking apps and blood testing kits aren't always regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the regulations are so complicated that often it is unclear to consumers which ones should be.

As the first reports of infected animals appeared in 2020, she began working on an artificial intelligence model that would predict which creatures might be next. \"We had a pretty lofty goal of being able to predict exactly which species we should be keeping an eye on, given that we think it's going to spill back,\" Dr. Han said. As her team worked, the trickle of cases in new species became a flood: cats and dogs in homes and mink on farms. The virus infiltrated zoos, infecting the usual suspects (tigers and lions) as well as more surprising species (the coatimundi, which is native to the Americas and resembles a raccoon crossed with a lemur, and the binturong, which is native to Southeast Asia and resembles a raccoon crossed with an elderly man).

Scooping up their two young daughters and squeezing them tight. \"I just imagine when we're back together,\" the Olympic Games worker says, \"and I just can't control myself.\" So athletes from countries where the coronavirus has raged can compete in the Olympic host nation with few infections, China's workforce at the Winter Games is making a giant sacrifice.

But there was an underside, the dirty work of soldiering.

When it rained, poisons percolated into aquifers from which they drew drinking water.

Evidence links it to lupus, and a recent study reported that people with long Covid were more likely than others to have an active Epstein-Barr infection (though it is unclear whether that infection causes symptoms, because the virus can proliferate when the immune system is under stress without creating any health problems). There are documented associations between mono and multiple sclerosis, a disease in which the immune system destroys a protective sheath called myelin that coats nerve fibers, often disabling communication between the nervous system and the rest of the body. \"People have been trying for many, many decades to prove that a virus causes M.S. or rheumatoid arthritis,\" says William H. Robinson, the chief of the immunology and rheumatology division at Stanford. \"And they have not been able to convincingly demonstrate that it does.\" (Tingley, 2/23) [ The Washington Post: Mountain Glaciers May Have Less Ice Than Estimated, Straining Freshwater Supply ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/07/mount-everest-glacier-ice-melt/) As global temperatures rise, mountain glaciers around the world are sweating.

The first year the class was offered, nearly a quarter of the undergraduate student body enrolled. You could see that as a positive: all these young high-achievers looking to learn scientifically corroborated techniques for living a happier life. But you could also see something melancholy in the course's popularity: all these young high-achievers looking for something they've lost, or never found. Either way, the desire to lead a more fulfilled life is hardly limited to young Ivy Leaguers, and Santos turned her course into a popular podcast series \"The Happiness Lab,\" which quickly rose above the crowded happiness-advice field. (It has been downloaded more than 64 million times.) \"Why are there so many happiness books and other happiness stuff and people are still not happy?\" asks Santos, who is 46. \"Because it takes work!

COVID Supercharged It ](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-02-25/covid-anti-vax-childhood-vaccination-measles-mumps) Conspiracy theorists' disinformation has led to the deaths of thousands of Americans every week by discouraging COVID-19 vaccinations. That toll will end up being a tiny fraction of the anti-vax movement's body count. Even when this pandemic is over, an energized base of anti-vaxxers will lead to more deaths for years to come. The uptake of standard childhood vaccines was already declining before COVID-19 hit, leaving more and more children vulnerable to diseases like diphtheria, measles, rubella, smallpox, mumps, tetanus and whooping cough. Since the pandemic began, we're also seeing more politics-driven attacks on state mandates for pre-school vaccination. Long-vanquished child-killing diseases will rise again, just because parents have been fooled into rejecting safe, long-proven vaccines. (John P.

My throat felt parched. I became fatigued and so irritable that I snapped at my daughter, who had accompanied me to the store. I knew what was happening: These were the effects of insulin rationing. I had only taken half my prescribed dose of insulin and my blood sugar was spiking. I hadn't been able to pay for a prescription refill, and had taken less than a full dose of insulin, so that the supply I had could tide me over until payday. I knew I could be risking my kidneys, my eyesight, or possibly death. However, I had to pay the mortgage, keep food on the table and the electricity on.

I was stunned! I started thinking how GoodRx makes a profit, and why would a pharmacy discount their price so much just because you show them a plastic card sent to you? I wanted to know how much the drug price varied at different pharmacies, so I did a small survey. All the pharmacies I visited couldn't give me a price because they needed a prescription. But the fact that the same drug can cost up to five times more in one pharmacy than another - and with the use of a discount card you can get up to an 85% reduction in costs shows how distorted and dysfunctional drug pricing is.

Low-income and minoritized populations, such as Black and Hispanic Americans, are not only at greater risk of infection, hospitalization, and death from the disease, but they are also up to twice as likely to develop chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The roots of these disparities are deep and complex.

As the organization's leadership works to dig itself out from this blow to its reputation, it must rectify another issue that's been threatening its legitimacy for almost two years: CDC orders that have justified the baseless expulsions of asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Hospitals operate under certain accrediting agencies, most commonly The Joint Commission, which, along with state laws, require them to adopt medical staff bylaws that provide for a fair hearing process consistent with \"due process\" if they intend to take a negative action such as trying to limit or revoke a physician's medical staff privileges. Due process requires that legal matters be resolved according to established rules and principles which, in the context of curtailing a physician's privileges, includes a fair hearing. "}
