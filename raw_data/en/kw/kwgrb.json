Breakfast: A green smoothie with either 40 herbal detox capsules or 2 sachets/scoops of BodiTune powder Lunch: Another green smoothie or green salad Snacks: Apples, avocados, cucumber or olives. Dinner: Very simple hot food or salad, Green Juice or smoothie with 2 sachets/scoops of BodiTune powder. Bedtime: 40 herbal detox capsules if you're on the Detox capsules (if you are on the Detox capsule version)Hunger should decrease as the first couple of days on live green food should dramatically increase energy levels.
