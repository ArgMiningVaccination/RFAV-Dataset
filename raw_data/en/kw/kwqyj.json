Yes. There are prescription medications called \"influenza antiviral drugs\" that can be used to treat flu illness. Antiviral drugs work best when started early, such as one to two days after your flu symptoms begin. - What are flu antiviral drugs? Flu antiviral drugs are prescription medicines (pills, liquid, an inhaled powder, or an intravenous solution) that fight against flu in your respiratory tract. Antiviral drugs are not sold over the counter. You can only get them if you have a prescription from your doctor or health care provider. Antiviral drugs are different from antibiotics, which fight against bacterial infections. Antiviral Drugs Most people with flu have mild illness and do not need medical care or antiviral drugs.

Flu antivirals are prescription medicines (pills, liquid, intravenous solution, or an inhaled powder) and are not available over the counter. - Antiviral drugs can make illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They might also prevent serious [flu complications](/flu/symptoms/symptoms.htm), like pneumonia, when treatment is started early. - It's very important that antiviral drugs be started early after symptoms begin to treat people who are very sick with flu (for example, people who are in the hospital) and people who are sick with flu and have a greater chance of getting serious flu complications, either because of their age or because they have a higher risk medical condition. Other people also might be treated with antiviral drugs by their doctor. Most otherwise-healthy people who get flu, however, do not need to be treated with antiviral drugs.
