She has an abundant passion for the mind, body and spirit connection and is devoted to a holistic healing approach. Her approach stems from healing her own body and transformation over 10 years ago. Using nutritious food as medicine, and incorporating breath-work, yoga, meditation and energy healing into her life, she healed her body of Lyme Disease, autoimmune disorders, staph infection and emotional trauma without the use of conventional medicine. Dena discovered energy healing as a means of relieving stress and balancing energy, as she worked through her own past traumas and physical pain. She has a BA in Psychology, is a certified Energy Healer, Reiki Master, Intuitive Soul Coach and Yoga-Meditation instructor. During healing sessions, Dena is guided by her intuition, while using various modalities in order to get to the root cause of physical and emotional dis-ease. She combines her intuitive gifts with breath work, visualization, and essential oils to release blocks, balance out energy centers, and offers life tools and positive habits for clients to continue on a path to achieve their life purpose. Dena also teaches yoga and meditation, and hosts healthy eating workshops around town. Her goal is to bring more awareness to the public concerning the benefits of energy healing and holistic care. "}
