But it's routinely used in tiny quantities as a preservative for food and to treat various medical conditions. Learn more about it here.", "sitename": "Healthline Media", "date": "2018-10-19", "cleaned_text": "Overview Phenol is a type of organic compound. While toxic to consume on its own, it's available in tiny doses in many household products like mouthwash and spray cleaners. In its pure form, it may be colorless or white. It has a mildly sugary scent that might remind you of somewhere that's sterile, such as a hospital room. In limited quantities, it's available for several medical and health-related uses. Pure phenol is used in certain medical procedures and as an ingredient in numerous treatments and laboratory applications. Phenol Injection Phenol can be injected into your muscles to treat a condition known as [muscle spasticity](/symptom/muscle-spasticity). This happens when your brain doesn't communicate properly with your spinal cord and nerves. It causes your muscles to become tight. Muscle spasticity can even interrupt your ability to walk or talk. It can be caused by conditions like [Parkinson's disease](/health/parkinsons-warning-signs), [cerebral palsy](/health/cerebral-palsy), or [brain trauma](/health/head-injury). A phenol injection helps limit the signals sent from your nerves to your muscles that cause contractions. This allows you to move more easily and feel less discomfort. This treatment is similar to getting a [botulinum toxin A (Botox) shot](/health/botox-poison). But phenol tends to be more useful for large muscles. Chemical matrixectomy Phenol is commonly used in surgeries for [ingrown toenails](/health/ingrown-toenail-surgery%0a#what-is-it). It's used on more severe ingrown toenails that don't respond to other treatments. The phenol, in the form of trichloroacetic acid, is used to stop the nail from growing back. A small [2001 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11558873) However, phenol matrixectomy may be falling out A [2014 paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25514278) Vaccine preservative Phenol is [used as 23 like [meningitis](/health/meningitis-pneumococcal) Vi [typhoid fever](/health/typhoid) [smallpox](/health/smallpox) - a phenol compound called 2-Phenoxyethanol is used in the vaccine Ipol, for [polio](/health/poliomyelitis) Sore throat spray Phenol is used in some throat sprays that can help numb your throat and relieve symptoms caused by a [sore throat](/health/cold-flu/help-sore-throats), or irritation in the mouth caused by [canker sores](/health/canker-sores). You can buy [over-the-counter phenol spray](https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/phenol-oromucosal-route/description/drg-20072736) almost anywhere. The most common brand is [Chloraseptic](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=d5d62f7a-8f92-4d42-a2fb-691f896f72fc). It contains about [1.4 percent phenol](https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=d5d62f7a-8f92-4d42-a2fb-691f896f72fc). Phenol spray is safe to use at the recommend dose for a short time. But using too much or giving it to children younger than 3-years old can be unsafe. Read the ingredients label carefully to make sure you're not allergic to any other components of the spray. And if your sore throat is accompanied by a fever, nausea, and vomiting, see a doctor as soon as possible before using phenol for throat soreness. Oral analgesics Many phenol-based products that help relieve pain or irritation in or around your mouth can also be bought over-the-counter to numb tissues in the mouth and lips. These products are used as a short-term treatment for the symptoms of [pharyngitis](/health/pharyngitis). This happens when your throat gets inflamed from a bacterial or viral infection. Phenol-based products for mouth and throat pain are widely available and safe to use in small doses. But throat sprays and antiseptic liquids shouldn't be used for more than a couple days at a time. And if you're having symptoms like fever and vomiting, see a doctor. Phenol derivatives Phenol-derived compounds have a variety of uses, including: [Chemical peels](/health/chemical-peels). Phenol in trichloroacetic acid is used to penetrate through layers of skin to get rid of old or damaged skin. - Food and cosmetic preservatives. Phenol derivative butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) is a common FDA-approved preservative used in , and to keep food from going bad. It's safe to consume in small amounts. But some companies have [cosmetics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12396675) [removed BHT](https://cen.acs.org/articles/93/i8/General-Mills-Remove-Antioxidant-BHT.html)from their foods in response to public pressure. Phenol liquid Phenol liquid is often used in molecular biology with trichloromethane and chloroform to separate RNA, DNA, or proteins, and isolate them in the pure form. This process is known as liquid-liquid extraction. It's done by adding an equal amount of phenol and chloroform to a solution of cells or tissues. The phenol-chloroform mixture separates molecules based on how soluble the tissue sample is in that solution. The [pH level of phenol](http://physiology.med.cornell.edu/faculty/mason/lab/zumbo/files/PHENOL-CHLOROFORM.pdf) helps separate the DNA and RNA. Soap and antiseptic Soap containing phenol-based compounds is often called carbolic soap. It's been used as an antiseptic during surgery [since at least 1867](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673602518274). It was also a common fixture in state schools in England and Scotland [until the 1980s](https://web.archive.org/web/20170223064928/http:/balsallheathhistory.co.uk/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDgvMDgvMTFfNDNfNTJfMTk2X0NhcmJvbGljX1NvYXAucGRmIl1d/Carbolic%20Soap.pdf). It's remembered by millions in the United Kingdom for its distinct smell and red streaks it left on bathroom sinks. Carbolic soap is still widely used throughout the world. It's also a common tool used to assist countries who receive [foreign aid](https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/west-africa-appeal-no-01022001-programme-update-no-2) from organizations like the Red Cross or Doctors Without Borders. It provides effective, low-cost hygiene to poverty-stricken communities. Over time, pure phenol has been replaced by some of its derivatives as an antiseptic. One derivative is n-hexylresorcinol, which can be found in cough drops. The compound, [butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)](/health/food-nutrition/potential-tbhq-dangers), replaced phenol as a food antioxidant. Despite its toxicity in its pure form, phenol has been shown to have numerous health benefits. Antioxidants Plant-based compounds containing phenol are known to be [antioxidants](/nutrition/foods-high-in-antioxidants). This means that they can stop the reaction of [free radicals](/nutrition/antioxidants-explained#section1) with other molecules in your body, preventing damage to your DNA as well as long-term health effects. Free radicals are molecules that have lost an electron and become unstable. This makes them prone to react with and damage molecules like DNA. Free radicals sometimes cause the molecules they react with to create even more free radicals. Antioxidant molecules are like a barrier between free radicals and healthy molecules: antioxidants replace the missing electron and render it harmless. Some notable phenolic antioxidants with proven health effects include: [bioflavonoids](/health/bioflavonoids), found in [wines, teas, fruits, and vegetables](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2013/162750/) [tocopherols](/nutrition/foods-high-in-vitamin-e), including , found in many fruits, nuts, and vegetables [vitamin E](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminE-HealthProfessional/) [resveratrol](/nutrition/resveratrol), found in [fruits, nuts, thymol Cancer prevention Phenol-based compounds have been found to have some cancer prevention properties. A [2010 animal review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21520702) Most of this research comes from animal models, but human studies are also promising. According to a [2014 paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25312621) Phenol may have its share of uses and health benefits, but it can also be toxic or cause long-term health effects if you're exposed to it in high amounts. Here a few tips to avoid exposure: - Be careful at work. Being exposed to phenol may increase your risk of [in industrial facilities](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/phenol/default.html) [heart disease](/health/heart-disease). This may be partly due to exposure to many other industrial chemicals in addition to phenol. - Don't eat anything that might contain phenol. [Consuming phenol](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=146&tid=27)in its pure form can damage your esophagus, stomach, intestines, and other digestive organs. It can be fatal if you have enough of it at one time. - Don't put it on your skin. Pure phenol can damage your skinif it makes direct contact. This can include [burns and blisters](https://sp.ehs.cornell.edu/lab-research-safety/Documents/Phenol_First_Aid_and_PPE.pdf). - Don't inhale it. Laboratory animals experienced breathing difficulties and twitching of muscles when they for even a short period of time. Phenol has also been shown to cause systemic organ damage in laboratory animals. [breathed in a lot of phenol](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK214904/) - Don't drink it. [Consuming water containing a lot of phenol](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/39958/9241510889-eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y)can make muscles spasm and affect your ability to walk. Too much can be fatal. Phenol has numerous health benefits and can be helpful to treat a few different conditions. But it can be dangerous and even deadly in high amounts. Be careful in places that may contain high levels of phenol, such as industrial facilities. Don't eat or drink anything that may have been exposed to phenol or have uncontrolled amounts of phenol in it. "}
