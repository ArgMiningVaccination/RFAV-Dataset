F inally , at 4:00 a.m., Madison slept, and, at 6:00 a.m., she w as sleeping and af ebrile a fter she had re ceive d Tylenol and Advil. Id. Dr. Tor natore agreed that Madison did not have a T able e ncepha lopathy because she did not have 24 hours of sig nificantly decr eased level of c onsciousness. Tr. a t 21, 25. On Marc h 30, 2002, at 7:10 a.m., Madison was ve ry irritable a nd cry ing. Id. She was administered Ty lenol rec tally. At 8:50 a.m., she wa s febr ile and irritable . Tr. at 22. Motrin wa s given. At 11:00 a.m., Madison was slee py. She was g iven a spong e bath. At 8:00 p.m., she wa s irritable. Id. Howeve r, DPTH included w hole-c ell DPT, not ace llular DPT, and whole- cell DPT has11 more reactivity than acellular DPT. R. E x. J, p. 1, of the text. 28Madison went on to have a chr onic seizure disorder and now ha s 20 to 30 seizures per day (epilepsy ) despite medic ation and is deve lopmentally delay ed. a t 25-26. Dr. Tor natore connec ted Madison's first seizure a fter the acellular DPT with her subseque nt seizures. Tr. at 26. Madison had an a cute r eaction to the vaccine with seizures, feve r, and irr itability . There are signific ant numbers of children w ho rec eive a cellular DPT and have seizures. Id. Respondent's Exhibit J discusses infant a cellular DPT immuni zation over two y ears as re ported to VAERS. Tr. at 27. The re were 63 serious re actions re ported a nd 367 deaths. Id. Ninety -six convulsions were reported, whic h was 10 pe pe rcent of vac cinee s had fe ver, while 25.7 per cent ha d agitation. Tr. at 28-29. Even though the amount of endotoxin in acellular DPT is less than it was in whole-cell DPT, there is still endotox in in the ace llular vac cine a nd most people rec ognize that the endotoxi n component proba bly led to the neur ologic issues with whole-ce ll DPT. Tr. at 31. There is much lot-to-lot variability in the amount of endotoxin. Id. Here, Madison had some prior immune deficiency. After the vaccination, she had associated fever and irritability, suggesting something diff use occ urred in her ne rvous sy stem. Tr. at 32. Madison also rec eived HiB vacc ine when she received a cellular DPT vacc ine and, according to E x. J, Ta ble 3, those who received HiB with DPT h ad mo re reactions. Id. 11 Madison's first seizure wa s cause d by the tox icity of endotoxin on her nervous sy stem, but she subsequently develope d Kawa saki vasculitis, which ca n affect blood vesse ls. Her subseque nt MRI showed very diffuse hypomyelination. Tr. at 34. Her brain M RI showed diffuse changes in29her w hite matter so Madison now ha s centra l nervous sy stem involvement which could be the result of the K awasaki vascula r proc ess. Tr. a t 34-35. Even if Ma dison had not develope d Kawa saki disease , her initial seizure fr om the vaccination would have led to a chronic seizure disorder. Tr. at 35. After the initial toxic e vent, there was a seizure foc us in her bra in where the ner ves have been injure d, causing recurrent seizures. Id. All someone nee ds is one insult t o the bra in to cause c hronic injury . Tr. at 35- 36. After Madison was discha rged from Ba ptist Hospit al, she re turned with a se cond seizure and was transferred to Children's Hospital because of her repetitive seizures. At Miami Children's Hospital, she deve loped a r ash ar ound April 11, 2002. The f irst indication she had develope d Kawa saki would date f rom that time. Tr. at 36. Dr . Tornator e's opinion is that Madison's re action to ac ellular DPT ca used her Kawa saki disease . Id. After she re ceive d the endotoxi n, she deve loped fe ver a nd an immune problem. Perha ps her se izures were due to an early vasculitis since vasculitis can cause seizures. That may be how the Kawasaki initially prese nted. Id. But in cla ssical Kaw asaki, the r ash occ urs first. I n petitioners' Ex. 7, p. 21, the Dutch article discussing Kawasaki disease, the authors state they could identify problems w ith these children's humoral immune system, i.e., their CD4 cells were not as active as they should have be en. Id. Kawa saki is an autoimmune disease . Id. When confronte d with an antig en, an immune sy stem that is deficient ha s difficulty clearing it properly , leading to vasculitis. Tr. at 37-38. An infection might precipitate Kawasaki disease. Tr. at 39. Madison was expos ed to bacte rial antig ens in ac ellular DPT, which he r immune sy stem could not clea r prope rly and, 10 days later, she develope d an immune re sponse demonstrate d as a r ash. The timing betwee n the vaccination and her subsequent deve lopment of Kaw asaki make s immunol ogic sense. T r. at 40. Howeve r, just two weeks a fter he r vac cinations, Madison tested positive for12 enter ovirus on April 13, 2002. 30Dr. Tor natore stated that the a cellular DPT cause d Madison's initial convulsion and chronic seizure disorder as we ll as Kawa saki disease . Tr. at 40- 41. Be cause Madison's immune system is deficient, she ha d an abnor mal response to the antig ens in the ac ellular DPT and ha d a more prolonged fever. Tr. at 42. Dr. Tornatore denied that Madison had enterovirus in a rapid PCR test until a y ear after her vacc ination. Tr. at 43. Ma dison's abnormal br ain MRI a year12 after vac cination could be f rom a c ombination of the Kaw asaki a nd the seizure disorder . Tr. at 46. Her nervous sy stem was injured, ma nifesting in seizure disorder a nd developmenta l delay . Tr. at 50. In answer to the undersigned's question whether the vaccine was a substantial factor in causing Madison's first seizure even if Kawasaki disease were coincidentally about to become clinical, Dr. Tornatore answered yes because the acellular DPT added something very volatile into the immunol ogic mix at that point. Tr. at 55. Dr . Tornator e thoug ht that Kawa saki was the more likely cause of the chronic seizure disorder although the vaccine itself by causing a toxic effect to Madison's ne rvous sy stem could ca use the c hronic seizure disorde r as we ll. Tr. at 56. In the under signe d's hy pothetical that the va ccine did not cause the Kawa saki disease which arose coincidenta lly to the vacc ination, Dr. Torna tore stated tha t Kawa saki was a predominant factor in causing Madison's seizure disorder but the vacc ination was a substantial fa ctor. Tr . at 57. Status epilepticus is aty pical for Kawa saki. Id. Howeve r, the NCES dea lt with whole-ce ll DPT, not acellular DPT, a nd the authors13 attempted to weed out anyone with a prior medical abnormality. 31Dr. Tor natore agreed with Dr. B ellanti, that beca use of the dura tion of Madison's first seizure, she w ould have be en included in the N ational Childhood Ence phalopathy Study (NCES). Tr. at 66. 13 On cross-exami nation, Dr. Tornatore admitted that Kawasaki disease can present with febrile seizures. Tr. a t 69. He ag reed that Madison's cur rent c ondition was relate d to her Kawa saki disease and to the vac cination. Tr. a t 70. Not all of Madison's seizures we re associate d with feve r. Tr. a t 73. Madison's pre -existi ng dy sfunction 73-74. The g amma g lobulins are not the issue. The T-ce ll dysfunction is the issue bec ause of its im pact on the humoral a rm of the immune sy stem, making it more difficult for antig en cle arance whether by antibodies or the c ell-mediate d component. Tr. a t 74. An infec tion can trig ger Kawa saki disease . Tr. at 75. Ka wasa ki is an inflammatory , autoimmune condition. Id. Madison's April 2003 MRI could be c onsistent with vasculitis. Tr. at 76. The MRI chang es were due to e ither the Ka wasa ki or the ong oing se izure disorder. Id. Respondent's counse l directe d Dr. Tor natore to the PCR test of Madison's plasma on April 13, 2002 which de tected e nterovirus two we eks af ter he r vac cination. Tr. a t 78. Enterovirus c an ca use fe ver. Id. Enterovirus c an ca use upper respira tory infec tion. Id. Enterovirus c an ca use nasa l cong estion. Id. Around the e nd of Mar ch 2002, Madison's br other and mother w ere sick with feve r and c ough. Tr. at 83- 84. But e nterovirus would not ca use status epilepticus. Tr. a t 84. Dr. Torna tore stated tha t the sy nergy of the e nterovirus a nd four a ntige ns32(diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus toxoid, and haemophilus B influenza) was a probable scenario in an immunologica lly-challeng ed child that would lea d to subsequent per sistent fever s and seizures. Tr. a t 91. Madison stil l had some nasa l cong estion on April 5, 2002. Tr. at 92. Dr. Tornatore agreed that if Madison had been expos ed to enterovirus antigen, it would be har d for he r to clea r it from her body . Tr. at 95. I f Madison had ha d an ente roviral infe ction when she received a cellular DPT and HiB vacc ines, Dr. Tor natore would think both the infection and the va ccine s were substantial fac tors in causing her f ever and seizure. Id. If Dr. T ornatore added in the K awasaki disease , and assumed tha t the enter ovirus cause d the Kaw asaki disea se, he would say that all four f actor s (the two vac cinations, the ente rovirus, and the Kawa saki disease ) were substantial fa ctors in ca using Ma dison's feve r and initial seizure. Tr. a t 96. He lea ned more towa rd the va ccina tion as the ca use of the se izures beca use the e nterovirus wa s subclinical and it would be hard for him to see how the enterovirus would suddenly blossom into an acute febrile illness leading to status epilepticus. Id. The va ccina tion was the tipping point pushing Madison over and causing the seizure disorder and, if we accept the enterovirus was there, in conjunction with enter ovirus that led to the subsequent va sculitis. Id. Dr. Tor natore said that enter ovirus alone wa s not enoug h to cause the Kaw asaki disea se. Tr. at 97. Ma dison's immune response c ould not mount antibodi es to the inciting antig en because the humora l arm of he r immune sy stem was not working well, but the ce llular arm of her immune sy stem was. So she had a cell-me diated re sponse, but not an antibody response . Tr. at 97-98. The cellular dysimmunity causes chemokine and cytokine release which can cause vasculitis. The T-c ells can infiltra te into the blood vessels and c ause infla mmation there. Tr . at 98-99. He r fever a nd prolong ed convulsion ar e evide nce of a cytokine storm. Tr. at 99. 33Respondent's counse l and Dr. Tor natore then eng aged in a discussion about whe ther Madison had an a febrile seizure as he r first seizure be cause in petitioners' Exhibi t 2, p. 45, Dr. Chacon records there was no fever before her first seizure. Tr. at 100. Since Dr. Chacon wrote what Madison's mother told him, t he under signe d called K imberly Burshiem, Madison's mother, to testify . Tr. at 111. Kimberly Burshiem testified that Madison rec eived the va ccina tion about 3:00 p.m. and was fussy that night a nd the next day . She reme mbere d having to hold her a lot. She believe d Madison's seizures beg an ar ound 7:00 p.m. the following da y. Tr. at 111- 12. Her seizure lasted about an hour and the a mbulance he lper thoug ht she had a little fever. Tr . at 112. B etwee n the time of vac cination and the time of Madison's first seizure, Ms. B urshiem fe lt Madison had a fever but she did not take he r temper ature . Id. Madison felt hot to the touch. However, Ms. Burshiem did not have a the rmometer. Id. When Ms. Burshiem spoke to Dr . Chacon on Mar ch 29 , she told him that she had notth taken Ma dison's tempera ture. She be lieves she told him that Madison felt hot. Tr. at 113. She did not tell anyone that Madison did not have a fever. She told them that she did not know if Madison had a f ever beca use she did not have a ther mometer. Tr . at 114. Ms. Burshie m felt that Madison was f ussy and wa rm. She was wa rm that day but got really fussy right before the seizure. Tr. a t 119. Ms. Burshiem thoug ht to herself she had better go get a thermometer to see if Madison had a fever. Tr. at 119-20. She laid M adison down to walk out the door. Tr . at 120. Madison had star ted to fee l warm in the middle of the da y. Id. Ms. Burshie m was also g oing to buy Tylenol with the thermometer . Tr. at 121.34Dr. Tor natore resumed te stifying a nd said that, consider ing Ma dison was immune defic ient, when she got fussy and had a feve r, she wa s having an immune-media ted re sponse. Tr. at 122-23. Dr. Tornatore stated that HiB vaccine could also cause temperature rise and it would be impossible to choose betwe en the a cellular DPT and the HiB as the c ause of Madison's fe ver. Tr. at 124. Ma dison was exposed to six antig ens, including the polio vacc ine and the enter ovirus, and she w as not immunologica lly capa ble of produc ing a ntibodies. Tr. at 125. Dr. Tor natore testified that, in both ty pical and a typical Ka wasa ki disease, f ebrile se izures are extremely rare. Tr. a t 126. The sca rce medical litera ture on Ka wasa ki disease se izures discusses childre n with rea lly profound ne urolog ic symptoms, such as anore xia and pr ogressive deter ioration of consc iousness. Tr. at 127. The case repor ts discuss more than a f ebrile se izure. Id. Madison had the se izure and wa s repor ted as fine a couple of day s later, smiling, ha ppy, and looking good. That is not consistent with Kawasaki significantly involving the nervous system in the case reports. Tr. at 128. The literature shows that 1 out of 200 children with Kawasaki will have c entra l nervous sy stem involvement or 0.4%. Id. Vasculitis of the nervous system be cause of Kawasaki disease in the two case reports is bad and progressive. The child in the case reports has a se izure beca use he or she has infla mmation of the blood vessels in the bra in. Id. Dr. Tor natore admitted that Kawa saki disease can r arely prese nt with febrile se izures. Tr. at 129. I t is also rare for a cellular DPT to cause a n acute neurolog ic injury . Id. Madison's treating immunologist Dr. Schif f recommended tha t Madison's pediatric ian submit a vacc ine adverse event report (VAERS) about M adison. Tr. at 130. He thought M adison had a possible adver se reaction to her vacc inations. Id. We do not usually see this in medical r ecords. Tr. at 131. 35Dr. Joseph A. Be llanti, an immunologist, testified next for pe titioners. Tr. at 136. He direc ts the I tional Center for Interdisciplinary Studies of I mmunology . Id. His main research interests ar e antimicrobia l immuni ty and antibody , humoral, and c ell-mediate d response s to vacc ines. Tr. a t 137. He is also study ing a new r ecombinant a nthrax vaccine , immune responses to it, and possible reactogenicity. Tr. at 138. He is w orking on the fourth edition of his tex tbook on immunol ogy and has published ove r 400 pee r-reviewe d article s. Id. He ha s been pr esident of the Socie ty for Pediatr ic Resea rch, the Americ an Colleg e Immunology , abora tory Immunology . Tr. at 138- 39. He ha s been e ditor in chief of the journals \"Pedia tric ls and Asthma Proce eding s.\" Tr. a t 139. Dr. B ellanti thinks thi s is a very complex case with multiple factor s conver ging on Madison at eig ht months of ag e whe n she re ceive d the vac cine. Id. He thinks the vac cine wa s the triggering point that tipped Madison over the balance toward a cascading set of events, leading to her initial convulsion and subsequent c hronic set of convulsions or epilepsy from which she now suffe rs. Tr. a t 140. Kawa saki disease has an unknow n etiology but many suspected tr iggers. Id. It is a response of inflammation or a va sculitis that causes ra sh and obliteration of the c oronar y vessel, but primarily affects the muc ous membrane s, the ey es, and the mouth. I t can a lso involve the centra l nervous sy stem. Id. Kawa saki is an immune-mediate d disease. Id. Severa l bacter ial and vira l agents, such as me asles, par vovirus, herpe s, and Epstein- Barr, ha ve bee n implicated as trig gers and so have some va ccine s. Tr. at 141. Any thing that stimul ates the immune sy stem in all its di mensions can be a trig ger for Ka wasa ki. Id. Madison actua hy pogammag lobulinemia, ag ammag lobulinemia.14 36Madison had an immune de ficienc y at the time she wa s vacc inated. Id. During her first six months of life, Madison's mother' s antibodies (I bacte rial infec tions. Tr. at 142. Be cause Madison was bre astfed, she also had a ntibody protec tion (I gA). Id. When Madison's g amma g lobulin from her mother de clined, she ne ver ma de bac k the level and it continued to dec line so that, at eig ht months, i t was ver y low. Tr. at 142- 43. She was below 150 for all the g amma g lobulins. Tr. at 143. Madison had primar ily a B-cell problem (humoral immunity ) with some evidenc e of T- cell abnor malities. She had a tional hy pogammag lobulinemia. Id. At eig ht months, she was at her most vulnerable a nd, if she we re exposed to enter ovirus or bacteria, she would be susceptible. Tr. at 144. It was not until she received the vaccines that, within 24 hours, catastrophe occur red. Id. She had the c onvulsion due to the endotox in in the acellular DPT. The e ndotox in could have se nsitiz ed her to the subsequent deve lopment of Kawasaki. Tr. at 145. Endotoxin is a very potent Th1 stimulant. Lipopolysacharide is the main component of e ndotox in and is a ver y strong stimul ant of TH1 r esponses. Tha t could have initiated the vasculitis, and whate ver c aused the Kawa saki disease on its own would be enha nced by that added bur st of endotoxi n from the a cellular DPT. Id. Dr. Bellanti said that Madison's prolonged excretion of enterovirus was consistent with her a gammag lobulinemia. Id. People with immu ne deficiency cannot balance cytokines,14 making them more susce ptible to infections or disease s. Tr. at 147. Dr . Bellanti thinks the theory behind the injury is the innocent by stander. When Ma dison developed K awasaki disease , ceive d vac vac stimulated sy sing pr o-37inflamma tory cytokines, which is vasculitis affecting the blood vessels. Tr. at 147-48. Vasculitis in the brain causes the white matter to be demyelinated and destroyed. Tr. at 148. The initial insult t o Madison's bra in was due to the a cellular DPT vacc ine endotoxin. Id. Dr. B ellanti has had some c hild patients with epilepsy and most have a n epileptog enic f ocus. Tr. a t 149. That means they have a bit of destruction in the brain that becomes active when there is a stimulus, which could be too much salt, or fe ver, or any number of insults that cause the foc us to fire, causing repe ated c onvulsions. Id. Dr. B ellanti believes Ma dison had a ser ies subsequent infec tion, ger tha t tipped the balanc e was the ac ellular DPT vac cine. Id. Tr. at 151. Dr. B ellanti stated that the va ccine s were substantial contributing f actor s in causing Madison's seizure disorder . Tr. at 150. The enter not affe ct Madison's ce ntral ner vous system, but was just present in her blood stream for a prolong ed per iod of time. Id. The manifestations of Ma dison's Kawa saki disease occur red a fter he r vac cinations. Tr. a t 152. The rash wa s not detecte d until April 11 . Madison was g iven g amma trea tment for herth Kawa saki disease and she improve d. Id. Dr. B ellanti said that Madison's Ka wasa ki disease wa s atypical in that she did not have conjunctivitis, oral lesions, or corona ry involvement. She did have r ash, fe ver, a nd good response to intravenous g amma g lobulin. Tr. 153. unknow Id. Madison had dela yed my elination of her brain. Tr . at 155. On cr oss-examination, when asked if Kawa saki disease would explain every thing that happened to Madison, Dr. Bellanti responded that Madison's prolonged convulsions were a bit unusual for K awasaki. Tr. a t 156. Convulsi ons can be included in aty pical Ka wasa ki disease. 38Tr. at 157. Ma dison was protec ted by materna l IgG and did not have infec tions before her vaccinations. Tr. at 158. Six months before the vac cinations at issue in this case, Ma dison went to the emer gency room on Octobe r 8, 2001 with 100.4\u00ba feve r. Tr. a t 159. She had thrown up four times and had an incr eased tempera ture a s well as cong estion that day . Tr. at 160. Dr . Bellanti doubted that this was the beg inning of her K awasaki disease beca use upper respira tory infec tions are ve ry common in this age group par ticularly with a two-y ear-old brother in day care. Id. This was not a serious infection. Tr. a t 161. A child with hy pogammag the throat, a nd the skin, as in pneumonia, and mor e serious ones involving joints, as in septic ar thritis. Id. Madison was 11 days short of two mo nths or six weeks of ag e at the time of her O ctober 2001 emer gency room visit. Tr. at 162. Vasc occur s following va ccina tions and Kawa saki disease is a vasculitis. Tr. at 165. Dr. Bellanti thinks that vaccinations caused Madison's convulsions and may have contributed to the Kaw asaki disea se, but we do not know w hat ca uses Kaw asaki disea se. Id. We k now it is a vasculitis and DPT can cause a vasculitis. Vasculitis is m ore comm on in children with hypogammag lobulinemia. Id. He does not know if Kawasaki disease was simme ring in Madison befor e she r eceived her vacc inations. Tr. at 166. Clinically , Madison did not have any manifestations of Ka wasa ki disease whe n she re ceive d the vac cinations on Marc h 28, 2002. Id. Dr. B ellanti does not know if Ka wasa ki disease would ha ve occ urred even if Madison had not received DPT, but he f elt that the vac cine pr obably contributed to her feve r, her convulsions, and her pr olonge d convulsive disorder , and possibly enhanc ed the pr ogression of he r Kawasa ki disease. T r. at 168.39Dr. Bellanti said he did not know when Madison's Kawasaki disease began but it became clinical 14 day s after vacc ination. Tr. at 168, 169. The initial abrupt onset of fe ver a fter Madison's vac cinations was due to the vacc inations. Tr. at 169, 170. The initial fe ver w as due to the endotoxin in the acellular DPT v accine. Tr. at 171. The endotoxin pr omoted a vasculitis which starte d a cy tokine-mediate d injury that sustained the fe ver a fterw ards. Id. The vasculitis started within a f ew da ys of vac cination. Id. Madison's subsequent f evers, but not the init ial fever, was due to her vasculitis. Tr. at 172. Madison did not spike fevers during her first hospitaliz ation which ende d April 8 , but did spike fever s during her se cond hospitalization. Tr.th at 174, 176. Ther e were two pha ses: the first convulsive e pisode was due to the endotoxi n in the acellular DPT vacc ine; the sec ond phase w as whe n Madison went home a nd had more feve rs which could ha ve bee n due to the inflammatory response of the va sculitis. Tr. at 177. The vaccine caused the initial convulsion, convulsive disorder, and the brain injury, was involved in vasculitis, and proba bly contributed to the ong oing pr ocess of Kawa saki which involves vasculitis. Tr. at 177-78. Madison was probably having vasculitis before the clinical symptoms related to Kawa saki disease and the va ccine contributed to it. Tr. at 178. Kawasaki is a vasculitis and DPT can cause vasculitis. Tr. at 179. Chi ldren with hypogammag lobulinemia are more prone to vasculitis because they cannot c lear antig ens. Id. Madison was eight months of age w hen the maternal antibodies were gone and all these things happene d to her: ente rovirus, DPT, vasc ulitis aty wasa ki. Tr. at 179-80. D r. Bellanti did not think that Madison's emergency room v isit with congestion and fever at six to eight weeks of age was the onset of he r Kawasa ki disease. Tr . at 180. I f Dr. B ellanti acc epted that Madison's onset of Kawasaki preceded her DPT v accination, he thought DPT p ossibly40significantly aggravated it. Tr. at 181. He thought that Madison's mother's antibodies would still have pr otected he r at the a ge of e ight we eks. Id. Dr. Russell D. Sny der, a pediatric neurolog ist, testified first for re spondent. Tr. a t 182. His opinion is t hat Kaw asaki disea se ca used Madison's c ondition. Tr. at 184. Her first seizure the day after she r eceived ac ellular DPT wa s variously descr ibed as lasting 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and one hour. T r. at 185. She wa s seizing on ar rival to the ER on Marc h 29, 2002. Id. Madison was e ncepha lopathic but not for a dur ation of 24 hours. Tr . at 186. Ther e was no indication at the time that her seizure on Marc h 29, 2002 cause d her a ny perma nent neur ologic al injury . Tr. at 187. I f it had, Dr. Sny der w ould have e xpecte d that Madison would not have returne d to her pre -seizure state. Id. Her CT scan, bra in MRI , and EEG w ere normal. Id. Dr. Snyder regards the evidence as slim that acellular DPT causes Kawasaki disease because immuniz ation is ubiquit ous and Ka wasa ki is rare . Tr. at 188. He did not think t hat Madison's abnor mal immune sy stem prior to her immunizations had any particula r impact because, if it had, she w ould have mounted less of a response to the immuniz ation rathe r than more. Id. Dr. Sny der de scribed Ma dison's first seizure as prolong ed and f ebrile. Tr . at 189. She had a numbe r of f actor s that could produce feve r: enter ovirus, immuniz ation, and Ka wasa ki. Id. We d o not know for sure when her Kawasaki began and it may well have been before the first seizure. Tr. a t 190. Madison could easily have be en incuba ting Ka wasa ki disease a t the time she received he r immuniz ations on Marc h 28, 2002. Id. Enterovirus ha s been thoug ht to be associate d with Kawa saki disease . Id. Enterovirus has also been thought to be associated with febrile seizures. Id. It is rare for Ka wasa ki disease to pre sent with a fe brile seizure. Tr . at 191. 41Because of her positive PC R in April 2002, Madison had enter ovirus at that time. Id. We do not know when the onset of Madison's e nterovirus wa s. Tr. at 192. Madison ha d nasal c ongestion and a f ever, and other family members ha d respira tory illness. Tr. at 192-93. Kawasaki disease was becoming manifest during the course of her hospitalization in April 2002. Tr. a t 193. Aside from he r immune problem, Ka wasa ki disease e xplains ever ything that happene d to Madison, including he r intrac table seizure disorde r and de velopmental dela y. Tr. at 193- 94. Madison's bra in MRI in April 2003 showing hy pomy elination is ex plained by sts as cer ebral vasculitis. Tr. at 194. Ther e is no evidenc e in the medical litera ture that a cellular DPT cause s vasculitis. Id. Dr. Sny der's experience with local confe rences and the national meeting s in his specialty prompt him to di sagree with the opinion that ace llular DPT cause s vasculitis. Tr. at 195. Madison's va sculitis was due to Kaw asaki disease. Id. Vasc ulitis is a known fe ature of Ka wasa ki disease, but not a known f eatur e of acellular DPT. Tr. at 196. Dr. Sny der state d that ace llular DPT did not trigg er Kawasaki disease in Madison. Id. Acellular DPT is so ubiquitous that he would see an association between it and Kawasaki if it occur red. Id. Madison's initial white blood cell count was e levated. T r. at 196-97. E nterovirus can c ause a rash a nd ence phalopathy if there is a direc t viral invasion. Tr. at 197. Ente rovirus was never detected in Madison's cerebrospinal fluid and, therefore, she never had encephalitis from the virus or a dire ct infec tion within her nervous sy stem from the virus. Tr . at 198. Dr. Sny der sa id that Kawa saki disease is an immune response to c ertain inciting ty pes of agents but not a direc t infectious disease . Id. The I nstitut e of Me dicine would not conc lude that acellular DPT cause d Madison's seizure bec ause the re were other c auses that c ould be found. Tr .42at 201-02. Dr. Snyder did not agree that acellular DPT can cause chronic seizure disorders in children. Tr . at 203. He a greed that ace llular DPT can c ause f ebrile se izures. Id. He said that if a child has an acellular DPT followed by a febrile seizure, if the child has subsequent seizures, some underlying condition causes those subsequent seizures. Tr. at 203-04. There is a genetic predisposition to develop febr ile seizure. Tr. a t 204. Dr. Sny der a greed that whateve r causes the initial fever triggers the manifestation of that condition. Tr. at 204-05. Dr. Snyder calls this condition \"g eneralized epilepsy with febrile se izures plus\" meaning plus other ty pes of se izures. Tr. at 205. SCN1A and othe r genes a re involved. Tr . at 206. Dr. Sny der a greed that people ha ve a g enetic pr edisposition to develop Kawa saki syndrome. Tr . at 208. Ther e are thing s associate d with the onset of Ka wasa ki, such as enter ovirus. Id. Many infec tious ag ents ca n trig ger Kawasaki. Tr. a t 209. No medical litera ture convince s Dr. Sny der tha t vacc ines ca n trig ger Kawasaki. Id. Dr. Sny der state d that the vac cine may have c ontributed to the feve r that ca used Madison's first seizure. Tr . at 210. He a greed that some children c an deve lop chronic se izure disorders f rom a sing le injury or insult. Tr. at 213. This assumes some foc us of injury . Tr. at 213-14. I n general, what c aused the first seizure ca uses the subseque nt seizures. Tr. at 214. Kawasaki disease's symptoms include fever and rash, both of which were present in Madison. Tr. at 214- 15. The ra sh occur red dur ing the fourth hospitalization (counting the October 1991 ER visit, the first visit to B aptist Hospital on March 29, 2002, the second visit to Baptist Hospit al on April 9, 2002 with a tra nsfer on April 10, 2002 to Miami Chi ldren's Hospital) from A pril 10-20, 2002. Tr. at 215. But M adison did not have muc osal changes, cervical lymphadenopathy, or cardiac problems. Tr. at 216. However, she did have a response to43IVIG thera py. Id. She did not have conjunc tiviti s. Tr. at 217. The re are two c ases pe r 1,000 of Kawa saki disease involving fe brile seizures. Id. Most of the time, no specific cause is found for vasculitis. Tr. at 219. The authors of the medical a rticle de scribing two febr ile case s among 1,000 case s of Kaw asaki disea se state that they expected ther e to be a lot of febr ile seizures because of the ve ry high f evers in Kawa saki, but they found only two case s. Tr. at 222. Dr. Sny der c annot say when Ma dison first had enter ovirus. Tr. at 225. The only way enter ovirus could ca use a se izure would be by causing a fever. Tr . at 226. Ther e is no evidenc e of foc al bra in injury in this case. Tr. a t 227. Acellular DPT could have been a contributory factor in trigg ering Madison's first seizure. Tr . at 229. Madison may have be en har boring enter ovirus befor e she r eceived her Marc h 28, 2002 vacc inations and g iven enter ovirus to her family or the other way around. Tr. at 230. Dr. Snyder agreed that when a child has a febrile seizure and then subse quent seizures, a br ain MRI may not show foca l brain injury . Tr. at 231. He agreed that whateve r caused the fir st seizure cause d the ong oing c hronic seizure disorde r eve n without evidence of foc al bra in injury . Id. If in this case, the re were no enter ovirus, no Kawa saki disease , and , der w ould ag ree that the vac cination triggered the first seizure. Tr . at 231-32. I f he a dded bac k into the equation the hypogammag lobulinemia, his opini on would not chang e. Tr. a t 232. I f he a dded bac k into the equation the subc linical enter ovirus, it would have contr ibuted as a f ever trigger. Tr . at 232-33. Dr. B rian Ward, a n infec tious disease spec ialist, testified nex t for re spondent. Tr. a t 238, 240. He has spent a lot of time studying vaccines and vaccine imm une responses, but is not a formally trained immunologist. Tr. at 240. His opinion is that fever caused Madison's first seizure which e volved due to a c ombination of her e nterovirus a nd Kawa saki disease persisting44for 12 mo nths. Tr. at 241. He thinks the vaccine is known to elicit low-grade fever in some children a nd Madison was infe cted by enter ovirus, which is one of the most common causes of febrile seizures. Tr. a t 241-42. At least one me mber of Ma dison's family was ill and she ha d an upper r espirator y tract infection. Tr. a t 242. Feve r is a cla ssic sy mptom of enterovirus. Ma dison also had a runny nose and w as fussy . Id. If Madison had not ha d the vac cination at the time and everything e lse wer e the sa me, people w ould think thi s was a c lassic pre sentation of ente rovirus. Tr. at 243. Dr . Ward was surpr ised that none of Ma dison's treating physicians picked up on the PCR test results of ente rovirus infec tion in the blood. Id. Madison's runny nose shows that she was incuba ting something just when she re ceive d the vac cine. Tr . at 243-44. Dr. Wa rd stated that Madison's case was enormously complicated because of her possible immunocompromise. Tr. at 244. When a c hild has an immune sy stem deficie ncy, whether T- cell or a ntibody , he ag reed with Dr. B ellanti that she is much more likely to have tra nsient difficulty in making a ntibodies. Id. Under those circ umstances, he r manife stations of common infec tions are not nec essar ily typical. Id. It would be useless to decipher which of her symptoms were typical or not of a n enter ovirus infec tion. Tr. at 244-45. Te n or 12 day s after her initial hospitaliz ation, Madison had a PCR positi ve for enter ovirus infec tion. Tr. at 245. We do not know the date of her exposure to enterovirus. Id. Dr. Ward sa id that we all ag ree that Madison was re latively well until the time she received he r Mar ch 28, 2002 vac cinations. Id. His best g uess is that her e nterovirus manife sted around the time she rec eived a cellular DPT and HiB vacc ine and wha t we have here is a very unfortunate coincidenc e of timing . Id. Ace llular DPT is known to be associa ted with mild fever. 45Tr. at 246. The re is no question in Dr. Ward' s mind that the ace llular DPT and HiB vacc inations may have c ontributed to her f ever even if in fac t she was incuba ting e nterovirus a t this t ime. Id. Dr. Ward state d that feve r is the ca rdinal diag K could not have c aused K awasaki in a day . Tr. at 246- 47. He thinks it imposs ible to say whether Madison had Ka wasa ki disease a t the time of her immunization. Tr. at 247. There is a known association betwe en ente rovirus infec tion and Kawa saki disease . Id. He a dmitted he did not have a clue whe n Madison's Kaw asaki disea se beg an. Tr. a t 249-50. Dr. Ward be lieved that Madison had a n underly ing vir al infec tion that was on the ver ge of becoming manifest whe n she re ceive d a vac cination that boosted her feve r a little bit. He did not think we would eve r know how muc h eac h of these two initiating factors contributed to her feve r. Tr. at 250. He includes the HiB vaccine as a contributing factor because any vaccine can cause mild fever. In studies of haemophilus B influenza vaccine, you see mild fevers, as you do with acellular DPT. Id. Any immuniz ing pr oduct might be expected to re sult in a mil d feve r in a small number of c hildren. Tr. a t 250-51. That is rly true with inac tivated vac cines. Tr . at 251. His opinion is that at least two of the thre e vac cinations plus her unde rlying e nterovirus combined in a way he cannot separate to cause Madison's mild fever which led to her first seizure. Id. Madison did not have any high spiking feve rs during her f irst hospitaliz ation from Mar ch 29 to April 8, 2002, but she rec eived hug e doses of Tylenol. Tr. at 252. She ha d persistent low- grade feve r. Tr. a t 253. He ag rees that live vacc ines are associate d with Kawa saki, but not inactivated va ccine s, acc ording to the literature . Tr. at 254. The endotoxi n in DPT and ac ellular DPT probably does contribute both to the mild feve r and the efficacy of the va ccine . Id. 46Dr. Wa rd said that if Madison had never received her third acellular DPT, all the events that occur red c ould be completely explained by her unde rlying immunolog ic difficulties a nd the enter oviral infec tion. Tr. at 258. Howe ver, if the enter ovirus wer e not there and only the vaccinations, Dr. War d said he could not get beyond the acellular DPT v accine's and HiB vaccine's ca using the first febr ile seizure. Tr. a t 259. When Madison rec eived he r Mar ch 28, 2002 vac cinations, she wa s exposed to five antig ens (pe rtussis, tetanus, diphtheria, hae mophilus B influenza, and polio). Tr. a t 260. Madison was a little bit more fr agile beca use she ha d difficulty eradicating an ente rovirus over a period of a year. Tr. at 262. Af ter the va ccina tions, she beca me sy eas be fore the vac cinations, she wa s not. Id. Madison was late r found not to have dece nt humoral re sponses to the vac cine a ntige ns so she did not respond as e xpecte d to the vacc ines. Tr. at 264. She made very low titers of antibodies to diphtheria a nd tetanus tox oids. Id. Neither acellular DPT nor HiB is known to have a ny direc t immunos uppressive e ffect on any body . Tr. at 264.65. There is no evidence of a c ytokine storm in Madison's case . Tr. at 266. Dr. Ward thoug ht that Madison's persistent fe ver w as the re sult of a per sistent enterovirus infec tion. Tr. at 267. Madison was w ell until a day or two of he r Mar ch 28, 2002 immuniz ations. Tr. at 268. Seve ral of he r family members we re ill at the time. Id. If she ha d some deg ree of hy pogammag lobulinemia, one would expect that was the time she ac quired enter ovirus (in the we ek pre ceding her va ccina tions). Id. This was ea rly spring when enter oviruses ar e known to prolife rate. Id. The vast majority of fevers associated with inactivated va ccine s are gone within 24 hours. Tr. a t 268-69. Her persisting feve rs wer e not related to her immunizations, but to her e nterovirus. Tr . at 269. 97-518V, 2000 WL Spec. Mstr. J an. 19, 2000).15 47Dr. Ward ha d some doubts that Madison had Kaw asaki disea se or e ven vasc ulitis . Tr. at 270. He did not know the cause of Madison's abnormal brain MRI in April 2003 although persistent ente rovirus wa s a possible ca use as we ll as Kawa saki. Id. At the time Madison was vaccinated on Mar ch 28, 2002, she did not have feve r, fussiness, or r unny nose. Tr. a t 271. Even with a child with hy pogammag lobulinemia, the vacc ines ca n cause a febrile re action. Tr. a t 272. We have no idea when Ma dison developed e nterovirus. Tr . at 272-73. Dr. Ward agreed that Kawasaki disease is an autoimmune disease. Tr. at 277. Ten days would be an appropriate timeframe for causation of an autoimmune disease after an antigenic stimul us. Tr. at 277-78. D r. Ward does not know if Ma dison had Kaw asaki disea se. Tr. a t 278. If she ha d it, it was aty pical. Id. The most common cause of fe ver in the spr ing w hich is culture- negative as in Madison's case is enterovirus. Tr. at 279. Inactivated vaccines can cause febrile seizures within one to three da ys. Id. Dr. Ward state d there are many differ ent enter oviruses but all are known to be neurotropic . Tr. a 281. H e recognized that Madison's test of her c erebrospinal fluid was negative for enterovirus, meaning the virus had not entered her brain, but he said that the test achie ves only about a 50 to 60 per cent positivity . Tr. at 282. At that point, the undersig ned discussed H erkert v. Secre tary of HHS in which an 18-15 month-old child received acellular DPT and was cranky the night of vaccination which both sides' experts attributed to the vac cination. Tr. a t 284. The next morning, he w as limp like a rag doll. He had a cervical sec tion transverse myelitis, making him quadripleg ic, and his palms wer e red. I t turned out the whole f amily had cy tomeg alovirus, which the c hild had ha rboring Id. No. 00-149V, 2002 WL 1906501 Mstr. J 27, 2002).16 48Testimony from petitioners' s expert in Herke rt was that the a cellular DPT vacc ination cause d immunomodulation in the child which enabled the cytomegalovirus he was harboring to cause the transve rse my elitis. The undersig ned held f or petitioners a nd the dec ision was not appea led. Tr. at 285. The unde rsigned also discussed N ash v. Secr etary of HHS in which a c hild came to the16 pediatrician with a fever due to an undiagnosed pneumococcal infection, and received whole-cell DPT. He ha d a hig her fever after the DPT vac cination and wa s hospitaliz ed with pneumococ cal mening itis. Id. Testimony from petitioner' s expert in Nash was that the D PT modulated the child's immune sy stem so that he could no long er fight of f the late nt pneumococc al infec tion which bec ame c linical and much wor se, ca using me ningitis. The unde rsigned held f or petitioner and the de cision was not appe aled. Id. The unde rsigned said that a reasonable unde rstanding of this case is that Madison was harbor ing a n enter ovirus without any clinical sy mptoms before he r vac cinations on Marc h 28, 2002. Id. As a c onsequenc e of the vacc inations, she beca me mildly feve rish. The other effect of the vac cinations was to make patent the subc linical enter ovirus so that Madison develope d symptoms of an upper r espirator y infec (runny nose). ac HiB inations were substantial fac tors with the enter ovirus, another substantial factor, in causing Madison's first fe ver tha t led to her seizure. Tr . at 286. Subsequently , the enter ovirus either c aused a typical Ka wasa ki disease or did not cause K awasaki disease , depending on whether or not she had it. Dr . Ward did not think she had it because the enter ovirus itself could explain Madison's feve r spikes which ultimately beca me worse and49worse. Id. Her subsequent bra in MRI a year later w as abnor mal and wa s a conse quence of her repetitive seiz ures. Without the modulating her already poorly -func tioning immune sy stem, this would not have occur red. Id. The unde rsigned rule d on the re cord f or petitioners. Id. If the undersigned left out the Kawasaki disease, we have three factors-the enterovirus, the ac ellular DPT, and the HiB-a ll of which ca n cause feve r. None of the e xperts denie d this. Two to three weeks after the first fe brile seizure, Madison's f evers started to spike. Tha t is not explainable from the va ccina tions so som ething else wa s going on. T r. at 287. The vacc ines worsene d Madison immunologically beca use she c ould not fight off the enter ovirus althoug h she was doing a good job of it before the vac cinations bec ause she was a symptomatic before she received them. Tr . at 288. As a r esult of the sy nergy betwee n all three (the nterovirus a acellular DPT and HiB vacc ines), nterovirus ained stea m. Id. The undersigned held that Madison's chronic seizure disorder was related to her first seizure. Tr. a t 289. Whether the ente rovirus ac ted with or without Kawa saki, which it may or may not have c aused, se ems irre levant. The undersig ned held that a ll three: the e nterovirus, the acellular DPT vacc ine, and the ha emophilus B influenza va ccine -wer e substantial fa ctors causing Madison's fe ver w ithin 24 hours of her va ccina tions, causing her se izure. Tr. at 289-90. The unde rsigned held that ther e was a biolog ically plausible medica l theory , a log ical seque nce of ca use and e ffect, and a medically appropr iate time seque nce be tween the vacc inations, the harbor ing of the subclinical e nterovirus, the w orsening or sig which made the sy mptomatic, combining with the va ccina tions to cause the f ever causing the seizure50which was long, leading to subsequent seizures and the repetitive, high fevers, causing brain damag e and a wr itten opinion. Tr. at 291. DISCU SSIO N To satisfy their burde n of proving causa tion in fact, petitioners must prove by preponderant evidence \"(1) a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury; (2) a logic al seque nce of cause and ef fect showing tha t the vacc ination was the re ason for the injury ; and (3) a showing of a pr oximate tempora l relationship betwee n vacc ination and injury Althen v. of HHS, 418 F . 3d 1274, 1278 (F ed. Cir. 2005). I n Althen, the F ederal Circuit quoted its opini on in Grant v. Sec retary of HHS, 956 F .2d 1144, 1148 (F ed. Cir. 1992): A per suasive medica l theory is demonstrated by \"proof of a log ical sequenc e of c ause a nd eff ect showing that the vac cination was the reason for the injury [,]\" the log ical seque nce be ing suppor ted by \"reputable medica l or scientific e xplanation[,] \" i.e., \"evidence in the form of scientific studies or expert medical testimony[.]\" In Capizz ano v. Secr etary of HHS, 440 F .3d 1317, 1325 (F ed. Cir. 2006), the F ederal Circuit said \"we conclude that requiring either e pidemiologic studies, r echalleng e, the pr esenc e of patholog ical mar kers or genetic disposition, or g eneral in the sc ientific or medic al comm unities to establish a logical sequence of cause and effect is contrary to w hat we said in Althen....\" Close calls are to be re solved in favor of petitioners. Capizzano, 1440 F.3d at 1327; Althen, 418 1280. See generally, Knudsen v. Sec retary of HHS, 35 F .3d 543, 551 (F ed. Cir. 1994). 51With out more, \"evidence showing an absence of other causes does not meet petitioners' affirmative duty to show actua l or leg al causation.\" G rant, 956 F .2d at 1149. Mere temporal association is not sufficient to prove causa tion in fact. Ha sler v. US, 718 F.2d 202, 205 ( 6 Cir.th 1983), ce rt. denied, 469 U .S. 817 (1984). Petitioners must show not onl y that but for the va ccine or vac cines, Madison would not have ha d her f irst seizure and a se izure disorder, but also that the va ccine or vac cines wa s/were a substantial fac tor in bring ing a bout her fir st seizure and seizure disorde r. Shy face v. Secr etary of HHS, 165 F.3d 1344, 1352 1999). In essenc e, the spe cial master is looking for a medica l expl anation of a logic al seque nce of cause and effect (Althen, 418 F.3d at 1278; Grant, 956 F.2d at 1148), and medical probability rather than certainty (Knudsen, 35 F.3d at 548-49). To the undersigned, medical probability means biolog ic credibility or plausibility rathe r than e xact biolog ic mecha nism. As the Fede ral Circuit stated in Knudsen: Furthermore, to requ ire identification and proof of specific biological mechanisms would b e inconsistent with the purpose and na ture of the vacc ine compensa tion program. The Vac cine Act does not contemplate full blown tort liti gation in the Court of Fe deral Claims. The Act esta blished a fe deral \"compensa tion which awards are to be \"made to vaccine-injured persons quickly, easily , and with c ertainty and generosity .\" House Report 99-908, supra, at 3, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6344. The Court of F ederal Claims is there fore not to be seen as a ve hicle for asce rtaining precisely how and why DTP and other va ccine s sometimes destroy the hea lth and lives of ce rtain childre n while safe ly immuniz ing most others. 35 F.3d a t 549.52The F ederal Circuit stated in Althen, 418 F .3d at 1280, that \"the pur pose of the V accine Act's preponderance standard is to allow the finding of causation in a field bereft of complete and dire ct proof of how vac cines a ffect the human body .\" The F ederal Circuit in Capiz zano emphasized the opinions of petitioner's four treating doctors in that ca se. 440 F .3d at 1326. This case conce rns fe ver a fter a cellular DPT and HiB vacc inations, followed by a 45- minute and r uled befor e that ac ellular DPT may cause a fever pr ompting a se izure followed by a seizure disorde r. See Noe l v. Secre tary of HHS, 99-538V ed. See g 402407 (F ed. Cl. S pec. Mstr. June 27, 1997) (whole cell DPT ca used fe ver c ausing seizure and se izure disorder) . Of the f our expert witnesses, only Dr. Ward, r espondent's infe ctious disease e xpert, wa s doubtful that Madison had Ka wsaki disease , mindful that she was diag nosed with aty pical Kawa saki disease beca use she did not have all the sy mptoms of the classic Ka wasa ki disease. Dr. Ward thoug ht that all that happene d to Madison was explainable by her ha ving e nterovirus nt's neurolog ic expert Dr. Sny der ba sed his entire opinion on Madison's having Kawa saki disease beca use he a ttributed her f irst seizure, her se izure disorder, and her brain injury to K awasaki. As eve ryone ac cepte d, this is a very complex case be cause of the c onverg ence of four factors upon Madison at almost the same time. She proba bly was e xposed to enter ovirus since subsequent to her initial febrile seizure a nd conseque nt hospitaliz ations, she tested positive by53PCR for e nterovirus. She did not clea r this infection for a year. No one knows w hen she contracted enterovirus, but evidence shows that her older brother and mother had some respiratory difficulty just before Madison received her March 28, 2002 HiB and acellular DPT vaccinations (the under signe d Madison's inac tivated polio vacc ination because no one a t the hear ing a ttributed any thing to it althoug h Dr. Ward testified tha t any vaccination can c ause f ever). All the witnesses ac cept that Ma dison was sy mptom-free when she received he r Mar ch 28, 2002 vacc inations. W ithin 24 hours, she was irritable and wa rm. All the witnesses ac cept that the HiB and ac ellular DPT vac cinations contributed to her feve r. Madison deve loped a runny nose subseque ntly, but not fever spikes until her second hospitalization, a couple of weeks after her vacc inations. This confirms to the undersig ned that, althoug h responde nt's expert Dr. Snyder testified that Madison's Kawasaki disease caused her first seizure, the Kawasaki disease was not clinica lly manifest until after her initial seizure. The undersigned accepts that it is reasonable for Madison to have been expos ed to enterovirus (which has been associated with Kawasaki disease) but did not clinically manifest enterovirus at the time she was vaccinated with HiB and acellular DPT v accines. In addition to these fa ctors, Madison wa s immunodeficient. She could not g et rid of a ntige ns, hence her harbor ing e nterovirus in her blood for a y ear, according to the positive PC R tests. But the enter ovirus did not invade her cerebrospinal f luid, which means that the e nterovirus did not invade he r brain and ca use her brain injury . Dr. Ward disag reed on the lack of effect of enter ovirus on Madison's ce ntral ner vous sy stem (her brain) be cause he said that 40 to 50 per cent of the time, the PCR o f the cerebrospinal fluid will yield a false negative, but the undersigned is54in no position (and Dr. Wa rd is in no position) to say that this is the time that the negative PCR of Madison's c erebrospinal fluid was a false ne gative and she actua lly had ente rovirus infec tion of her brain. The c ourse that se ems most reasona ble to the under signe d is this: in late Marc h 2002, Madison was e xposed to enter ovirus (the a lternative is that she ha d been c arrying the virus even before then and actually gave it to her brother and mother) but did not develop clinical symptoms of enterovirus. She could not get rid of the enterovirus because of her hypogamma globulinemia (too littl e gamma g lobulin). HiB and ac ellular DPT vac cinations on Marc h 28, 2002 which, tog ether with the enter ovirus she wa s harbor ing, put more of a bur den on her immune sy stem and she de veloped irr itability and a f ever, resulting in her fir st febrile se izure lasting f rom 20 minutes to an hour, depe nding on the record notation. Madison spent a week and a half in the hospital, was released home, and within a day, was ba ck with fe ver a nd more seizures. B aptist Hospital could not deal with her c ontinuing fevers and tra nsfer red he r to Miami Chil dren' s Hospital on April 10, 2002, where her f ever reached 107.5\u00ba. T he spiking feve rs wer e the be ginning of her a typical Ka wasa ki disease. Although not all of Madison's many subsequent seizures were related to her many fevers, most were. A c ombination of the eff ect of the many seizures and he r Kawasa ki disease, c aused he r brain injury which appe ared on her br ain MRI a year later. Respondent's theor y, at least throug h Dr. Sny der, w as that Ka wasa ki disease initiated Madison's initial seizure, but the medical literature that both parties filed does not support this proposition. The literature discussing the rare occurrence of seizures and encephalopathy in Kawa saki disease patients also discusses the r eason f or this rare centr al ner vous ulitis , it can ca use subdura l effusion, that is, leakag e of c erebrospinal fluid into the brain, or it ca n cause vasculitis of dural ve ssels in the brain. Madison did not have either subdur al effusion or vasc ulitis of the dura l vessels in her brain a s we c an see from her initial MR I, which wa s normal. Her seizures, there fore, wer e not due to K awasaki disease not only because the Kawasaki arose after her seizures began but also because there is no biologica lly plausible explanation for how Ka wasa ki disease c aused he r seizures if we look solely at the vasc ular c omponent of the disea se. I ntere stingly , the ra te of febrile seizures among patients in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease is extremely low. This means that c erebral va sculitis and/or subdural ef fusion occur s rarely Kawa saki disease , which is a sy ndrome known more for c oronar y vasculitis. Madison had neither cerebral vasculitis nor subdural effusion. Kawasaki had nothing to do with her seizures. It is inst ructive to c ompare Madison's initial brain MRI , which wa s normal, with the brain CT sca n and bra in MRI of the little boy discussed in responde nt's Ex hibit H who had subdural vasculitis in his brain with seizures due to K awasaki disease. He had an abnormal brain CT scan two da ys after onset of his seizures and a n abnorma l brain MRI eight day s after onset of his seizures. It also instructive to compare Madison's 2003 bra in MRI , which wa s abnormal, with the brain M RI of the little girl discussed in respondent's Exhibi t C (also Ex. JJ), w hose brain M RI showed she ha d subdural ef fusion. Her brain MRI 12 months after the onset of her seizures showed diff use and se vere cerebral atrophy with Madison's CT scan nd brain MRI two wee ks after vacc ination which we re nor mal and with her brain MRI 12 months after the onset of her seizures which56showed no a bnormality except for a delay in my elination. A subsequent MRI showed ne uron death a nd an incr ease in my elination. A CT scan more than two y ears after the onset of Madison's seizures showed no e xtra-axial fluid collection and he r ventric les wer e at the uppe r limit s of normal. A br ain MRI done two and one -half y ears after the onset of he r seizures showed no e xtra-axial fluid collection and nor mal ventricle s. Madison never had subdura l effusion and enlar gement of he r sulci as the little g irl in the case repor t did. Clearly , from the litera ture de scribing the ra re oc currence of enc ephalopa thy and seizures in individuals with Kawasaki disease due to subdural vasculitis or effusion, their brain MRIs show the deva station of the inflammation of their br ain blood vessels and the prese nce of the leakage of fluid into their brains. Early and late MRI s and CT s cans show that Madison's brain vessels we re not inflame d and ther e was no ext ra fluid in her brain. Thus, ba sed on the litera ture that respondent filed pertaining to the rare instances when Kawasaki disease can cause convulsions and encephalopathy, Madison's experience with Kawasaki disease would not fit within those case analyses. Her Kawasaki experience spared the inflammation and fluid leakage that can rarely occur. Wh at did occur was fevers, but it was her vaccinations, specifically acellular DPT and HiB , that cause d her initial seizure and se izure disorder. Respondent submitted an article discussing hy potheses about the c ause of Kawa saki disease (immu ne impairment) and its clinical features, including extreme irritability, aseptic mening itis, and sensorineura l hear ing loss (Ex. C, second ar ticle). Madison wa s indeed immune- impaired a nd extremely irritable whe n she wa s broug ht to Baptist Hospital with seizures and fever, but she neve r had a septic mening itis or hearing loss. Of note, the a uthors of this major discussion on Kawasaki disease never mention Kawasaki causing seizures.57Respondent submitted an article on enterovirus-caused me ningoencephalitis with white matter a bnormalities on MRI (Ex. KK). CT scan r evealed fluid collec tion in the frontal extracerebral space of the five children with Kawasaki disease (which was 3.7% of the authors' 138 patients). But M adison did not have meningoencephalitis and she did not have fluid collection in the frontal extracerebral space. Moreover, the RT-PCR te st for enterovirus RNA in Madison's cerebrospinal fluid one year after her onset of seizures was negative even though it was positive in her w hole blood four months later in Aug ust 2003, showing that e nterovirus ha d never enter ed Madison's br ain and c ould not be responsible for her a bnormal bra in MRI one y ear after onset of her seizures. Acellular DPT and HiB vacc ines ca n cause feve r. Althoug h ace llular DPT's ra te of reaction is lower than whole -cell DPT vaccine , the literature shows that feve r does oc cur in 25% of vac cinee s. As the under signe d discussed at the e nd of the he aring in this case, the e ffect of DPT vacc ine, whethe r acellular (H erkert) or w hole-c ell (Na sh), ca n cause or incre ase fever and lead to wor sening of an unde rlying vir al (He rkert) or bac terial (N ash) infe ction. Shyface is a c ase quite similar to Madison's c ase, c oncer ning two- month-old who wa s vacc inated with whole- cell DPT at the time he was ha rboring the beg inning of E. coli infec tion, each of which could a nd did cause feve r that rose to 110\u00ba, causing his death four days later. 165 F .3d at 1345. Respondent def ended tha t the E. coli infec tion was the ca use of the baby 's fever a nd death. Te stimony from the pe titioners' doctor wa s that both the vacc ine and the infec tion were equally responsible for the fe ver a nd death. The Federal Circuit held that eac h of the two fa ctors (the vacc ine and the inf ection) w as a substantial fa ctor in ca using Chey enne Shyface's ve ry high f ever and dea th, and but for the pr esenc e of e ach of these two fa ctors, the58baby would not have had the high fever and would not have died. The Federal Circuit ruled in favor of petitioners e ven thoug h petitioners did not prove that DPT vac cine wa s the only or predominant c ause of his death. Id. at 1353. In the instant action, all the e xperts ag reed that HiB a nd ace llular DPT vacc ines contributed to the fe ver tha t cause d Madison's first seizure. Petitioners' e xperts testified that the vaccines wer e substantial fa ctors ca using the feve r that ca used her first seizure and se izure disorder a nd, but for the va ccina tions, she would not have had the feve r and the first seizure and seizure disorder . Respondent's experts disag reed with the \"but for\" testimony and, depe nding on the expert, opined that the e nterovirus wa s all that Madison neede d to have the c ourse she followed (D r. Ward's testimony ) or the K awasaki disease was a ll that Madison needed to ha ve the course she followed (Dr. Snyder's testimony). The undersigned finds that petitioners' experts are more c redible on this point. First, it does not help the per suasiveness of responde nt's argument ag ainst the vac cinations' being substantial fac tors in causing Madison's first fe ver, initial seiz ure, a nd seizure disorder that responde nt's experts do not ag ree with eac h other ove r what the known f actor unrela ted to the vac cinations is (enter ovirus? Kawa saki disease ? both) that is itself a substantial fac tor. Secondly , since re spondent's experts ag reed that whateve r the non- vaccine factor was (Kawasaki or enterovirus or both), they both agreed that the acellular DPT vaccination and HiB vacc ination contributed to Madison's first fe brile seizure. Dr. Car ro, a tre ating immunologist at Miami Chi ldren's H ospital, wrote on De cembe r 27, 2003 that Madison had delayed receiving further vaccination because of her seizures due to vaccine-induce d feve r. Many of Madison's doc tors diag nosed her with aty pical Ka wasa ki disease. T he Federal Circuit in Capiz zano emphasized taking the opinions of trea ting doc tors59seriously . There fore, the under signe d must give w eight to both the treating doctor's opinion that Madison's fe ver w as ca used by her va ccina tions and led to her se izures, and to Madison's treating doc tors' opinions that she had a typical Ka wasa ki disease. Dr. B ellanti had a pla usible expl anation for how ac ellular DPT may have xacerbate d Madison's Kaw asaki disea se bec ause in is composed of lipopoly sacha ride strong esponses whic h would enhanc e va sculitis that is the hallmark of Kawa saki disease . But it makes no the unde rsigned whe ther Ka wasa ki disease wa s cause d by the enter ovirus or by the vac cine, or was c aused by the enter ovirus and wor sened by the vac cine. There is an old principle in tort law that y ou take y our victim as y ou find him. The under signe d holds that the vacc inations were substantial fac tors in causing Madison's seizure disorder based on the ra rity of seizures appe aring in Kawa saki disease and Madison's not having any sign of cerebral vasculitis or cer ebral effusion on CT sca n or initial brain MRI . Moreove r, althoug h a great many of her subsequent seizures oc curred during feve r, she a lso had seizures without feve r, refuting the r ole re spondent's expert Dr. Sny der ha s attributed to Kawa saki disease . Since Madison's experienc e se and inc essant and hig h feve rs came two wee ks after vac cination, the under signe d acc explanation that ace llular DPT's endotoxi n enhanc ed Ka wasa ki disease, incr easing its effe ct on Madison. The unde rsigned also ac cepts that the e ffect of the va ccina tions was to make the late nt enterovirus pa tent so that Madison had a r unny nose af ter he r first fe brile seizure. Respondent is liable for da mages to petitioners bec ause the vacc inations were substantial factors in causing Madison's seizure disorder which Ka wasa ki disease, throug h incessant f ever60spikes, worsene d when she had seizures a ssociated with fe ver (and obviously was irr eleva nt when she had af ebrile se izures). Respondent take s his victim as he finds her. Congress' aim in passing the Vaccine Act was \"to establish a Federal 'no-fault' compensation program under which awards can be made to vaccine-injured persons quickly, easily, and with certainty and generosity.\" H.R. Rep. No. 908, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1986). If accepted tort law is that defenda nt takes his victim as he finds him, it would be strang e indee d for Congress to intend in passing the Vaccine Act to make it harder for petitioners to prevail than if they were in the customar y forum for resolution of tort claims. A look at tort law w ill be instructive for the parties. In Jimenez Nieves v. United States, 618 F . Supp. 66 (D.P.R. 1985), plaintiff, who had diabetes me llitus , sued the United States unde r the F ederal Tort Claims Act bec ause of the negligence of the Social Security Administration in stopping payment on his mother's benefit checks (Social Secur ity wrote the wrong date of her de ath in its recor ds). Nieve s was humiliated and suff ered the stress of se vere financ ial problems which ha d phy sical, mental, a nd emotional conseque nces. A Security c hecks, pla intiff' s diabetes wor sened. H e became depressed, impotent, and withdrawn, and deteriorated physically. Nieves became critica lly ill, almost blind, and totally disabled. B y the time of trial, Nieve s had had pa rtial amputations of both feet and his renal functions had ceased. The court found that the stress, anxiety, and depression resulting from the negligence of Social Security led to his diabetic condition becoming uncontrolled. The court found f or plaintiff. Looking a t statutory compensa tion schemes af fords a n even mor e dire ct view of how the undersigned should consider conditions unrelated to the vaccinations at issue. In Bludworth The doctors testified that they would never have prescribed narcotics to Lira for pain17 relief if they had known of his prior addiction. 61Shipy ard, I nc. v. L ira, 700 F .2d 1046 (5th Cir. 1983), the cour t reve rsed a decision of the Benefits Review B oard unde r the L ongshoremen' s and Ha rbor Worker 's Compensation Act, 300 U.S.C. \u00a7900 et seq. The B oard ha d grante d compensa tion to L ira who ha d hurt his back on the job. Lira was a former heroin addict who became re-addicted when the doctor, and subsequently the hospital which per formed a back ope ration on him, presc ribed na rcotics to dea den his pain. Lira had not informed either the doctor or the hospital of his prior addiction. Although his employ er Bludworth paid for all medical bills relating to Lira's back injury , it refuse d to pay for Lira's drug detoxi fication prog ram to trea t his heroin re- addiction. The U nited States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that Lira's deliberate omission of the information about his prior her oin addiction was a n intervening cause of his re- addiction and, ther efore, unlike norma l17 compensation law, his employer would not have to pay for the detoxif ication. In reaching this conclusion, the Seve nth Circuit discussed the doctrine of defe ndant' s (her e, employ er's) taking his victim (here, employee) as he finds him. We have r epeatedly held that an e mploy er takes an e mploy ee as he finds him. Aggravation of a pre existing c ondition can be a n \"injury \" unde r the Ac t. Id. at 1049. The c ourt cited numer ous case s for this proposition including He nsley v. Washington Metro A rea Transit Authority , 655 F.2d 264, 268 ( D.C. Cir. 1981), cer t. denied, 456 U.S. 904 (1982) (\" [T]he fa ct that the injury would not have r esulted but for the pre-existing disease, or might just have well been caused by a similar strain at home or at recreation, are both immaterial\" ); and J.V. Vozz olo, I nc. v. B ritton, 377 F.2d 144, 148 (D.C. Cir. 1967) ( employ ers accept with their employ ees the frailties that predispose them to bodily hurt). Id. at 1050, n.2. Compare the la nguage of the House Committee on Energ y and Commerce perta ining to the18 Vaccine Act: \"But for the relatively few who are injured by vaccines--through no fault of their own--the opportunities for re dress a nd restitution are limited, time-consuming , expensive, and often una nswere d.\" H .R. 908, diff erence in leg al standar ds under the L HWCA compared to the typical tort case (instructive for interpreting the Vaccine Act): the court's sole function was to deter mine whether the injury complained of arose out of the employ ment. This is unli ke the typical tort standard of whether a party in the conduct of his everyday affairs should be held legally responsible for remote consequences of his acts: \"Once the causation in fact is established, with only a few exceptions, the court' s function is at an e nd.\" Id. at 1050. The c ourt cited Atlantic Marine, Inc. v. Bruce, 661 F.2d 898, 901 (5th Cir. 1981) (claimant's arterioscler osis was not a super vening cause that would preve nt an awa rd of c ompensation). In citing c ongressional intent in passing the L HWCA, thi s court notices how simil ar tha t intent was to the one underlying the Vaccine Act: The dominant intent of Congress in enacting the LHWCA was to help longshor emen. The Act is intended to ... provide injure d employ ees w ith more immediate and less e xpensive re lief than that a vailable in a c ommon law tort action. Id. at 1051. The Seventh Circuit concluded that if Lira had not known of a particular weakness18 or susce ptibili ty, and conse quently did not know he should advise those doc tors trea ting him of what he himself did not know, ther e would have been no inter vening cause and L ira would ha ve preva iled. Id. at 1052. Clearly , under both c ommon tort law (def endant take s his victim as he finds him) and statutory compensa tion schemes (to provide more immediate, le ss expensive, certa in, and63generous relief ), petitioners he rein a re entitled to damag es for the ef fect of Madison's vaccinations ccina tions also caused K awasaki disease . The unde rsigned ca n fore see tha t in determining damag es, re spondent might take the view that it is petitioners' burde n to prove wha t proportion of Madison's da mage is due to her vaccine injury (the seizure disorder) and what proportion is due to her Kawasaki disease (assuming the vac cines did not ca use or sig nificantly aggravate that as we ll). Respondent might also take the view that the e nterovirus infe ction that Madison harbor ed subclinica lly until she had a runny nose and c ould not ge t rid of for a year also is a par t of the phy sical diffic ulties she had and petitioners ha ve the bur den to prove what dama ge propor tion to ascribe to the e nterovirus. This is not t he law. In D'Ambra v. U nited States, F.2d 275 Cir. 1975), the mother of a four -year-old boy killed by a postal truck sue d the United States for her conseque nt psy choneur osis. The court r eflected that she would not be able to r ecove r for the psycholog ical portion of the da mage, but def endant ha d never prese nted proof a s to what portion of her damag e was psy cholog ical ver sus phy sical. Ther efore, def endant wa s liable for the entire amount of her damages. In discussing the shifting of the burden of proving apportionment to defendant, the cour t stated: [W]here the ne gligent infliction of injury aggravates a pre -existi ng condition or disease, and no apportionment is possible, it has been held that the defendant is liable for the entire da mage, i.e., Ne wbury v. Vog el, 151 Colo. 520, 379 P.2d 811 (1963) ( pre-existing a rthritic condition); Kaw Yasutake , 49 Hawa ii 410 P.2d 976 (1966) (possible prior ba ck proble ms and an a rthritic condition); Blaine v. B yers, 429 P.2d v. Kaku, 484 P.2d 147 (Hawaii 1971) (pre-existin g back pain), Wis e v. Carter, 119 So.2d 40 (Fla. App. 1960) (prior injury). The justifications for this principle are, however, different from that used in the multi-collision cases. It is64sometimes said that a tortfe asor take s his victim as he finds him. S ee Blaine v. Byers, supra. Another rationale is that when a prior condition does not cause pain or disability, the injury caused by the tortfeasor is the proxima te cause of the pain or disability . Comment. Apportionment of Damag es, 49 De nver L .J. 115, 116 (1972) a nd case s cited there in. See also Ne wbury v. Vog el, supra. Id. at 1180. The instant ca se satisfies the r easoning descr ibed in D' Ambra in that Madison did not have a ny seizures or seizure disorde r prior to va ccina tion, and then deve loped a se izure disorder post-vacc ination, and if the e vidence does not permit appor tionment of the damag e betwe en the prior condition (e xposure to ente rovirus), the subse quent condition (Ka wasa ki disease) and the acellular DPT and HiB vacc inations, respondent is liable for the entire damag e. If evide nce doe s permit apportionment, it is respondent' s burden to provide it. The D' Ambra c ourt continued: Where a n injury which is indivisibl e is ca used by the neg ligence of the def endant concurring with an innocent cause, as a force of nature, the defendant is held responsible for the entire injury . Have rly v. State L ine & S.R. C o., 19 A. 1013 (Pa. 1890) ( fire c aused by negligence a nd wind); J ackson v. Wisconsin Tel. Co., 60 N.W. 430 (Wi s 1894) (ne gligently left wire plus lightning ); Long v. Cry stal Refrig erator Co., 277 N.W. 830 (Neb. 1938) ( defective building plus wind), a nd wher e an injury is theoretica lly divisibl e and one cause is innocent, the circumstance most ana logous to the instant ca se, the a ggravation of pre- existing injury case s constitute authority for holding the tortfea sor totally liable. Id. In Duty v. United States Dep' t of I nterior, 735 F .2d 1012 (6th Cir. 1984), one of the two plaintiffs in a ca r accident had ha d a pre -existi ng abnorma l curva ture of the tailbone (known a s spondy lolist hesis). Howe ver, she had not experienc ed pain f rom this condition prior to the acc ident. After the ac cident, she e xperie nced substantial pa in and suffe ring. The c ourt held that def endant wa s liable for a ll damag es proximately resulting from his neg ligence e ven65though pla intiff' s injuries may have r esulted fr om the ag gravation of a pre -existi ng physical impairment. I d. at 1014. See also F igueroa-Torre s v. Toledo-D\u00e1 vila, 232 F.3d 270, 275- 76 (1 Cir. 2000)st (\"eggshell skull\" doctrine whe re you take y our victim as y ou find him is st ill valid; beaten prisoner w ho died also had e nlarg ed splee n due to disease ); Stevens v. B angor and A roostook Railroad Co., 97 F.3d 594, 603 ( 1 Cir. 1996) (F ederal Employ ers' Liability Act or F ELA hasst broad r emedial pur poses; railwa y worke r injured in a f all had post-ac cident ca rdiac event; if the factfinder rate injuries cause d or exace rbate d by the ac cident fr om those resulting from a pr e-existing condition, defe ndant is liable for a ll such injuries). This analy sis of signific ant ag gravation and apportionment of da mages should g uide petitioners and r espondent a s to what the re quisite burdens ar e and w ho has them. From the evidenc e in this case, the undersig ned holds that but for the a cellular DPT and HiB va ccina tions, Madison would not have had seizures a nd a seizure disorde r. That she subsequently had Kawasaki disease (which the vaccines may have been substantial factors in causing toge ther with her enter for c ompensating petitioners for a ll the damag e to Madison which, from h er subsequent M RIs, appears to come from g liosis or neuron death. Her Kawasaki disease gave he r repetitive feve rs, which pr ompted more (but not all) of Madison's seizures af ter he r initial seiz ures. Responde nt takes his victim as he finds her . Dr. Tor natore 's and Dr . Bellanti's testimony and re spondent's ar ticles confir m that the vaccines were substantial factors in causing her seizures and that Kawasaki disease was a substantial fac tor not in causing her se izures but in crea ting a n environment that made them66occur more fr equently (repetitive feve rs, when she had seizures a ssociated with fe ver). Her pre- existing e nterovirus infe ction added to the sor ry immune state of this unfortunate little girl, but there is no way to tease out in terms of da mage the e ffect of the e nterovirus fr om the eff ects of the vaccines or the effect of the Kawasaki disease from the effects of the vaccines. Petitioners have made a prima f acie case that ace llular DPT and HiB vacc ines wer e substantial fac tors in causing Madison's fe ver, initial seizure, seizure disorde r, and subse quent developmenta l delay and, but for the se vac cinations, she would not have the condition she has today. CONCLUSION Petitioners have pr evailed on the issue of entitlement. The unde rsigned enc ourag es the parties to settle damages in this case. A telephonic status conference shall be set soon to discuss how to proceed with damages. IT IS SO ORDERED. December 17, 2007 s/L aura D. Millman DATE Laura D. Millman Special Master "}
