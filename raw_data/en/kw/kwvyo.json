The committee was mandated to study the existing system of Housekeeping in Government Hospitals and draft the National Guidelines for the same keeping in view the ground realities. This committee initially visited three central g overnment hospitals in Delhi to understand the existing system of housekeeping services. During these exploratory v isits, it was observed that the housekeeping services in these hospitals are currently being carried out in a combined manner by both in -house employees as well as outsourced staff, though the method of awarding the same to an external agency varied betwee n the hospitals. Wide disparity was observed in the management st ructure and staffing levels of h ousekeeping services between these hospitals and officials therein expressed difficulties in developing suitable tender documents for outsourcing of such servi ces due to lack of expertise and knowledge of housekeeping chemicals, equipment, etc in this field. Merits and de -merits of service contract vs manpower contract for outsourcing of these services was a major dilemma for officials and was further compounded due to conflicting opinions in this regard amongst different stakeholders . The ability of the se hospitals to handle such issues was found to be genuinely limited vis -a-vis autonomous institutions like AIIMS -New Delhi, PGIMER -Chandigarh, etc. where doctor s with professional training (postgraduate degrees in hospital a dministration ) manage these services on a fulltime basis. Further, unlike at autonomous institutions , these hospitals despite being of almost the same or larger size, do not have an in -house e ngine ering department and the maintenance works are carried out by the contractors appointed by the public works department. The hospital authorities are not 2015 empowered to expend on even minor / urgent repair works and are totally dependent on the public wo rks department officials - on whom they have no direct administrative control. The committee members then analyzed the tenders & contracts of these and other public & private sector hospitals to get a national pers pective of the existing system and the challenge s being faced therein. To find solutions to the identified problem, a detailed literature review of the existing best practices in the field of hospital sanitation & housekeeping in India & globally was done and relevant extracts from the same were adapted with suitable changes in the final guidelines. These guidelines focus on strengthening and streamlining of proper selection and mainte nance of infrastructure, development of suitable policies for housekeeping services, selection & training of ma npower, development and implementation of suitable cleaning methods in the form of protocols / SOP's, effective supervision and monitoring by adequate staff and in -built mechanisms in the contracts coupled with an organizational structure which puts a prem ium on good housekeeping and sanitation. They also describe the structure of the housekeeping department / service , roles & responsib ilities of workers & supervisors, quali fication, experience & training needs of sanitation staff, equipment details for mec hanized cleaning, chemicals & cleaning agents to be used, etc. The guidelines encourage that every health care setting should ideally perform their own time management studies to determine appropriate staffing levels for cleaning and supervisory staff . How ever, based on the experience of various stakeholders, the following broad thumb rules for housekeeping manpower have been prescribed in the guidelines so as to ensure appropriate 24-hour coverage in all hospital areas : 1 Sanitary Attendant for 2 Hospit al Beds 1 Sanitary Supervisor for 12 -15 Sanitary Workers 1 Sanitary Inspector for 5 -7 Sanitary Supervisors 1 Sanitary Officer for 5 - 7 Sanitary Inspectors 2015 Taking a cue from the Spaulding's classification for disinfection and in line with the best practices, it has been recommended that f or the purpose of housekeeping, various areas in the hospital should be broadly classified as high risk, medium risk and low risk. Accordingly, t he frequency & type of cleaning required, standard operating procedure s, key performance indicators, etc. have been detailed for each broad area. These guidelines also lay emphasis on the availability of basic sanitation infrastructure in the form of sluice rooms, janitor cupboards , etc. in all areas, use of appropriate hous ekeeping tools & equipment, laundering of re -used mops & dusters, cleaning standards, quality assurance and health & safety of sanitation staff. Due diligence has been recommended regarding pest control while tendering for housekeeping services by ensuring that either this service is included as one of the scopes of the housekeeping tender or a separate tender for the same is floated concurrently. At the end , a draft tender template for housekeeping services that can be adopted with minor customization t o a particular healthcare setting has been given to aid the hospitals in designing their tenders . Use of weighted average score method for tender evaluation has been prescribed to ensure that the technical competence, service deliverability & past performa nce of the bidders is also given due weightage along with their financial strength. *** 2015 Table of contents 1.

ABHRs contain emollients to reduce skin irritation and are less time -consuming to use than washing with soap and water. (1) Antiseptic: An agent that can kill microorganisms and is applied to living tissue and skin. Audit: A systematic and independent examination to determine whether quality activities and related results comply with planned arrangements, are imp lemented effectively and are suitable to achieve objectives. Biomedical Waste: means any waste, which is generated during the diagnosis, treatment or immunisation of human beings or animals or in research activities pertaining thereto or in the production or testing of Biologicals, and including categories mentioned in Schedule I of Biomedical Waste Management Handling Rules 1998. Cleaning: The physical removal of foreign (e.g., dust, soil) and organic material (e.g., blood, secretions, excretions, microorg anisms). Cleaning physically removes rather than kills microorganisms. It is accomplished with water, detergents and mechanical action. Contamination: The presence of an infectious agent on hands or on a surface such as clothes, gowns, gloves, bedding, to ys, surgical instruments, patient care equipment, dressings or other inanimate objects. Detergent: A synthetic cleansing agent that can emulsify oil and suspend soil. A detergent contains surfactants that do not precipitate in hard water and may also cont ain protease enzymes (see Enzymatic Cleaner) and whitening agents. Discharge/ Transfer Cleaning: The thorough cleaning of a client/patient/resident room or bed space following discharge, death or transfer of the client/patient/resident, in order to remove contaminating microorganisms that might be acquired by subsequent occupants and/or staff. In some instances, discharge/ transfer cleaning might be used when some types of Additional Precautions have been discontinued. 2015 Disinfectant: A product that is used on surfaces or medical equipment/devices which results in disinfection of the equipment/device. Disinfectants are applied only to inanimate objects. Some products combine a cleaner with a disinfectant. Disinfection: The inactivation of disease -producing microorganisms. Disinfection does not destroy bacterial spores. Medical equipment/devices must be cleaned thoroughly before effective disinfection can take place. Environment of the Patient: The immediate space around a patient that may be touched by the patient and may also be touched by the health care provider when providing care. The patient environment includes equipment, medical devices, furniture (e.g., bed, chair, bedside table), telephone, privacy curtains, personal belongings (e.g., clothes, book s) and the bathroom that the patient uses. In a multi -bed room, the patient environment is the area inside the individual's curtain. In an ambulatory setting, the patient environment is the area that may come into contact with the patient within their cubi cle. In a nursery/neonatal setting, the patient environment is the incubator or bassinet and equipment outside the incubator /bassinet that is used for the infant. Enzymatic Cleaner: A pre -cleaning agent that contains protease enzymes that break down prote ins such as blood, body fluids, secretions and excretions from surfaces and equipment. Most enzymatic cleaners also contain a detergent. Enzymatic cleaners are used to loosen and dissolve organic substances prior to cleaning. Fomites: Objects in the inani mate environment that may become contaminated with microorganisms and ser ve as vehicles of transmission. Healthcare Organisation : Generic term used to describe the various types of organisations that provide healthcare services. This includes hospitals, am bulatory care centres etc. (2) High -Touch Surfaces: High -touch surfaces are those that have frequent contact with hands. Examples include doorknobs, call bells, bedrails, light switches, wall areas around the toilet and edges of privacy curtains. Hospital Clean: The measure of cleanliness routinely maintained in client/patient/resident care areas of the health care setting. (3) Hospital Clean is 'Hotel Clean' with the addition of disinfection, increased frequency of cleaning, auditing and other infection control measures in client/patient/resident care areas. Low -Level Disinfectant: A chemical agent that achieves low -level disinfection when applied to surfaces or items in the environm ent. 2015 Low -Level Disinfection (LLD): Level of disinfection required when processing non -invasive medical equipment (i.e., non -critical equipment) and some environmental surfaces. Equipment and surfaces must be thoroughly cleaned prior to low -level disinfect ion. Low -Touch Surfaces: Surfaces that have minimal contact with hands. Examples include walls, ceilings, mirrors and window sills. Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS): A document that contains information on the potential hazards (health, fire, reactivity and environmental) and how to work safely with a chemical product. It also contains information on the use, storage, handling and emergency procedures all related to the hazards of the material. MSDSs are prepared by the supplier or manufacturer of the ma terial. Occupational Health and Safety (OHS): Preventive and therapeutic health services in the workplace provided by trained occupational health professionals, e.g., nurses, hygienists, physicians. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Clothing or equipm ent worn by staff for protection against hazards. Precautions: Interventions to reduce the risk of transmission of microorganisms (e.g., patient -to-patient, patient -to-staff, staff -to-patient, contact with the environment, contact with contaminated equipm ent). Sanitation - Promotion of hygiene and prevention of disease by maintenance of sanitary condition .(4) Above given definitions have been adapted from: Provincial Infectious Diseases Advisory Committee (PIDAC). Best practices for environmental cleaning for prevention and control of infections in all hea lth care settings - 2nd Edition. Ontario; 2012. 2015 1 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 1. Housekeeping - an Introduction It may be simply be defined as \"Provision of clean, comfortable, safe & aesthetically pleasing environment\". \"Housekeeping is a support service department in a hospital , which is responsible for cleanliness, mai ntenance & aesthetic upkeep of patient care areas, public areas and staff areas \". It is also known as sanitation department/ sanitation section/ sanitation services etc. Housekeeping services in a hospital is entrusted wi th maintaining a hygienic and clean hospital environment conducive to patient care. The hospital housekeeping services comprises of the activities related to cleanliness, maintenance of hospital environment and good sanitation services for keeping premises free from pollution. Housekeeper literally means \"keeper of the house\". Hospital housekeeping management may be defined as that branch of general management which deals with cleanliness of the hospital, general environmental hygiene, sanitation and dispos al of waste using appropriate methods, equipment and manpower. The housekeeping s ervices can be summarised as \"Al l the activities directed towards a clean, safe and comfortable environment'. (5) 1.1 Objectives of Housekeeping Department (5) To attain and maintain high standards of cleanliness and general upkeep . To train, control and supervis e staff under its establishment . To attain good relations with othe r departments. To ensure safety and security of all staff under its dep artment and to keep superior authorities inform ed about day to day activities. Control and issue of clean ing materials and equipment . To maintain official records on staffing, cleaning materials and equipment . 2015 2 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 2. Principles of Cleaning in a Health Care Envi ronment Health care organisations are complex environments that contain a large diversity of microbial flora, many of which may constitute a risk to the patients, staff and visitors in the environment. Transmission of microorgani sms within a health care or ganisation is complicated and very different from transmission outside health care settings ; and hence the consequences of transmission may be more severe. High -touch environmental surfaces of the health care organisation hold a gr eater risk due to the nat ure of activity performed in the health care organisation and the transient behaviour of employees, patients and v isitors within the health care organisation , which increases the likelihood of direct and indirect contact with contaminated surfaces. Transmi ssion involves: Presence of an infectious agent (e.g. bacterium, virus, fungus) on equipment, objects and surfaces in the health care environment . A means for the infectious agent to transfer from patient -to-patient, patient -to-staff, staff -to-patient or s taff-to-staff . Presence of susceptible patients, staff and visitors. In the health care organisation , the role of environmental cleaning is important because it reduces the number and amount of infectious agents that may be present and may also eliminate r outes of transfer of microorganisms from one person/object to another, thereby reducing the risk of infection. (1) Health care organisation s may be broadly categorized in to two components for the purposes of environmental cleaning: a) Hotel component is the area of the facility that is not involved in direct patient care; this includes public areas such as lobbies and waiting rooms; offices; corridors; elevators and stairw ells; and service areas. Areas designated in the hotel component are cleaned with a \"Hotel Clean \" regimen. 2015 3 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals b) Hospital component is the area of the facility that is involved in direct patient care; this includes patient bed space/room (including nursing st ations); procedure rooms; bathrooms; clinic rooms; and diagnostic and treatment areas. Areas designated in the hospital component are cleaned with a \"Hospital Clean \" regimen. 2.1 Evidence for Cleaning The enviro nment of the health care organisation has be en shown to be a reservoir for infectious agents such as bacteria (e.g., methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus al vi rus - RSV, rotavirus etc. ) and fungi (e.g., Aspergillus spp.). However, the presence of microorganisms alone on objects and items in the health care environment is not sufficient to demonstrate that they contribute to infection. (1) Various studies worldwide have shown that microorganisms can survive after inoculation onto items/ surfaces; and/ or can be cultured from the environment in health care organisations ; and/ or can proliferate in or on items/surfaces in the environment. T here is a direct means for microorganisms from contaminated items/surfaces in the environment to be transferred to hands of healthcare providers. E xposure to contaminated items/surfaces in the environment is associated with acquisition of colonization or infection ; and this proves that decontamination of items/surfaces results in reduction of infection transmission, i.e., lower rates of colonization or infection .(1) Therefore environmental cleanliness is intrinsically linked to infection prevention and control. A clean, well ordered environment provides the foundation for excellent infection control practice to flourish. The primary objectives of hospital cleanliness are two folds: (6)(7) To disinf ect so that the threat of nosocom ial infection is reduced To create a clean and safe, attractive environment for patient, staff and visitors. 2.2 The Hospital Environment and Sanitation Patients shed microorganisms into the health care environment, particu larly if they are coughing, sneezing or having diarrhoea. Bacteria and viruses may survive for weeks or months on dry surfaces (8)(9)(10) in the environment of the patient (the space around a patient that may be touched by the patient and may also be touc hed by the health care 2015 4 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals provider ). The d esignation of a patient's environment varies depending upon the nature of the health care organisation and the ambulation of the patient. (1) For example: In acute care, the patient environment is the area inside the curtain, including all items and equipment used in his/her care, as well as the bathroom that the patient uses . In intensive care units (ICUs), the patient environment is the room or bed space and items and e quipment inside the room or bed space. In the nursery/neonatal setting, the patient environment is the incubator or bassinet and equipment outside the incubator /bassinet that is used for the infant. In ambulatory care, the patient environment is the immedi ate vicinity of the examination or treatment table or chair, and waiting areas. In some care environments, e.g., mental health, long -term care, paediatrics, the patient environment may be shared space, such as group rooms, dining areas, playrooms , central showers and washrooms etc. Cleaning disrupts transmission of these microorganisms from the contaminated environment to patients and health care providers. Improving cleaning practices in hospitals and other health care organisations will contribute towards controlling health care -associated infection and associated costs. (1) Table 1Items found to harbour microorganisms in the healthcare environment (11)-(12) Bed Bed frames Bed linen Bedside table Bedside locker Bed rail Call bell Curtains Blood pressure machine Dustbin Key board Fauc et handle Couch Door handle Thermometer Patients bathroom Floor around bed Light switch Overbed table Patient lift Pen Pillow Mattress Sink Stethoscope Tables Telephones Television Toilet commode TV remotes Stationery items Window frames Following figure shows the most common high touch surfaces in the healthcare environment, therefore due attention must be paid while cleaning them. 2015 5 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Figure 1 High touch surfaces in environment (1) 2015 6 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Health care organisations should have policies that include the criteria to be used when choosing furnishings and equipment for patient care areas. Prior to purchase, compatibility of materials and finishes with hospital -grade cleaners, detergents and disinfectants should be assured. When there is doubt about product compatibility, the manufacturer of the item should be consulted. A process must be in place regarding cleaning of the health care environment th at includes (1): Choosing finishes, furnishings and equipment that are cleanable . Ensuring compatibility of the health care organisation 's cleaning and disinfecting agen ts with the items and surfaces to be cleaned . Identifying when items can no longer be cleaned due to damage. The ease of cleaning is an important consideration in the choice of materials for health care organisations . This applies to medical equipment and all finishes and surfaces including materials for floors, ceilings, walls, and furnishings. Although new products are being developed that are coated with materials that retard bacterial growth, there is no evidence that antimicrobial impregnation of items in the environment is associated with a reduced risk of infection or cross -transmission of microorganisms in health care. Product 'antibacterial' claims should be carefully eva luated before replacing items. (13) All finishes (e.g., wall treatments, floor finishes) in clinical areas should be chosen with cleaning in mind, especial ly where contamination with blood o r body fluid is a possibility. (14) the p referred surface characteristics, including but not limited to (15): Ease of maintenance/repair and cleanability Inability to support microbial Good sound absorption/ac oustics inflammability (C lass I fire rating) Durability Sustainability Presence of low levels of volatile organic compounds (voc) to reduce off -gassing Low smoke toxicity 2015 7 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Initial and life cycle cost -effectiveness slip -resistance Ease of installation, demolition and replacement Seamlessness Resilience and impact resistance . Non-toxic and non -allergenic. Hospital surfaces require regular cleaning and removal of dust. Dry conditions favour the persistence of gram positive cocci in dust and on surfaces, whereas moist soiled environment favour the growth and persistence of gram negative bacilli. Fungi are also present in dust and prolifer ate in moist, fibrous material. (17) Cloth furnishings have been shown to harbour higher concentrations of f ungi th an non -porous furnishings. (13) In general, pathogenic bacteria canno t be effectively removed from the surfaces of upholstered furniture. Contaminated stuffing and foam cannot be decontaminated if breaks in fabric or leaks of body fluids or spills have occurred. Wherever feasible, an alternative to cloth surfaces should be used. (1) Safe practices for plastic coverings, including mattress covers and pillow covers, include: Clean plastic coverings on a regular basis. Inspect for damage. Repl ace mattress and pillow covers when torn, cracked or when there is evidence of liquid penetration. The mattress or pillow should be repl aced if it is visibly stained. (13) There must be a process to enable reporting, removal and replacement of torn, cracked or otherwise damaged coverings. Clean plastic coverings (e.g., mattress c overs, keyboard covers) with hospital -grade disinfectants that are compatible with the covering. Electronic equipment poses a challenge to environmental cleaning and disinfection. When purchasing new equipment, only keypads, mouse and monitoring screens t hat may be easily cleaned and disinfected should be considered and should be compatible with the health care organisations cleaning and disinfecting products. Plastic skins may be effective to cover computer keyboards, allowing ease of cleaning. Electronic equipment that cannot be 2015 8 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals adequately cleaned, disinfected or covered to allow appropriate cleaning, should not enter the immediate patient care environment. (1) 3. Organisat ion of Sanitation Department 3.1 Guiding Principles All health care organisations must devote adequate resources to sanitation services which include: An individual with assigned overall responsibility for the sanitation services of the hospital (18) Written procedures for cleaning and disinfection of patient care areas and other areas : o Defined responsibility for specific items and areas . o Clearly defined lines of accountabilit y. o Procedures for daily and discharge/ transfer cleaning and disinfection . o Procedures for cleaning in construction/renovation areas . o Cleaning and disinfection standards and frequency . Adequate human resources to allow thorough and timely cleaning and disin fection . Priority for cleaning given to patient care areas rather than to administrative and public areas . Provision for additional environmental cleaning capacity during any exigency that does not compromise other routine patient care cleani ng. (19) Education and conti nuing education of sanitation staff . Monitoring of environmental cleanliness and results reported back appropriately to become a part of the employee's performance review . (19) Supervision of cleaning staff by those who are trained and knowledgeable in cleaning standard s and practices . Ongoing review of procedures. These cleaning practices are applicable to all healthcare organisations whet her cleaning is conducted by in house s taff, or contractual staff . They are designed to be used as a standard 2015 9 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals against which in -house services can be benchmarked, as the basis for specifications if sanitation services are being outsourced and as the framework for evaluation of sanitation services by sanitation supervisors and Officer i n charge .(1) When sanitation services are being outsourced , the contract must clearly define the infection control -related responsibilities. These should include not only the sanitation procedures, but also the outsourced agency's responsibility for employee h ealth and mandatory training. (18) Outsourced agency must work collaboratively with Nursing Department and Infection Control Committee to ensure the safety of patients , staff and visitors; contractual barriers that prevent this from happening should be removed. 3.2 Organogram Following is the proposed Organogram of the sanitation services / department: Figure 2 Recommended Organogram of Sanitation Section / Department Preferably in house employees Outsourced agency's manpower or in -house 2015 10 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Depending upon the size of the organisation , requirement of Senior Facility Manager and Facility manger may also be built into the manpower requirement for sanitation services from the outsourced agency.

Provide a b udget to the management, and undertake budget control and forecasting. Roles and Responsibilities of Sanitary Inspector (23) He/she is sanitation in charge of the assigned area . To supervise and guide sanitary supervisors in their work. To report to Sanitation Officer, regarding administrative constraints faced by Sanitary Attendants of the area. To take surprise round of ward/OT etc. for cleanliness of toilet etc. Any other responsibility assigned by Sanitation Officer or Hospital Administration Roles and Responsibilities of Sanitary Supervisor (23) To supervise the work of Sanitary Attendants To provide replacement of Sanitary Attendants if regular Sanitary Attend ant is on leave. 2015 15 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals To ensure the cleanliness and proper sanitation of the area under his/her supervision. Roles and Responsibilities of Sanitary Attendant (23) He/she is responsible for keep ing the area neat and cle an, assigned to him/her . He/she will promptly give spotlessly clean urinals and bed pan as and when required by patients. He/she will assist nursing staff in collect ion of urine and stools specimens . He/she will assist in cleaning and disinfect ion of soiled linen, mattresses, articles etc. Any other task assigned by nursing staff, sanitary inspector and other higher officials. Roles and responsibilities of plumber He will be on the rolls of the agency to which sanitation services are outsourced . He will do routine minor repairs of sanitary fittings for ensuring effective sanitation and hygiene level in healthcare organisation. He will promptly attend to calls received form patient care areas, administrative and other areas. He will not carry out any major repair work and report such issues to engineering department through his/her supervisor . Any other task assigned by Sanitation Department . 3.4 Staffing Adequately staffed sanitation department is one of the most important factors that govern the success of environmental cleaning in a health care organisation . Staffing levels must be appropriate to each department of the health c are organisation , with the ability to increase staffing in the event of any exigency . General staffing levels may be calculated by adding the average time taken for a worker to complete individual tasks . Average cleaning time is the normal time required fo r a qualified worker, working at a comfortable pace, to complete an operation when following a prescribed method. (24) Education and training are important factors in determining average cleaning time; a new worker will not work at the same pace and as efficiently as an experienced worker. Written procedures and checklists for cleaning will assist in 2015 16 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals standardizing cleaning and disinfection times and will ensure that items are not missed during the cleaning. Each health care organisation should be encouraged to perform their own time management studies to determine appropriate st affing levels for cleaning and supervisory staff, taking into consideration the following factors: (1) Building factors o Age of the facility - older buildings are harder t o clean o Design of the facility - e.g., amount of walking required to complete a task o Size of the facility o Climate o Season o Exposure of facility to outside dust and soil, e.g., construction site o Type of floors and walls Occupancy factors o Occupancy rate and vo lume of cases o Patient mix and type of care in the area (e.g., acute care, long -term care, clinic) vs. No care in the area (e.g. public area) o Frequency of clea ning required in an area (e.g. once daily vs. a fter each case) o Square meters to be cleaned in pat ient care areas o Square meters to be cleaned in non -patient care areas o Admissions/discharges/transfers by unit/area - more rapid turnover requires a shorter turnaround time for rooms and equipment and more frequent discharge/ transfer cleaning. Equipment fa ctors Training factors Infection control factors Presence of outbreaks 2015 17 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals As general rules of thumb it is proposed that for calculating human resource requirement for sanitation services for a hospital , district level and above , following parameters can be used: 1. Total requirement of sanitary attendants for a hospital - One Sanitary Attendant for two hospital beds (It takes into account the total manpower requirement of entire hospital premises for all three shifts including personnel for reliever duty and leave reserve). 2. One Sanitary Supervisor for 12 -15 Sanitary Attendants 3. One Sanitary Inspector for 5 - 7 Sanitary Supervisors 4. One Sanitary Officer for 5 - 7 Sanitary Inspectors 5. One Senior Sanitation Officer and Officer Incharge for a Healthcare Organisation 6. One plumber should be physically available at all times depending upon the size of the healthcare organisation. However , the following manpower requirement is recommended according to the type of patient care area: 1 Wards : Minimum 1 sanitary attendant per ward in e ach shift for a ward size of up to 30 beds, if more than 30 beds then one additional sanitary attendant may be provided in the morning shift . 2 Operation Theatre: One sanitary atten dant for two operation theaters for each shift. 3 Intensive Care Unit : One sanitary attendant for up to six ICU beds in each shift and thereafter additional for each six beds in the morning shift. However , in the evening and night shift allocation can be halved . 4 OPD: In OPD s one dedicated sanitary attendant should be posted for each public toilet considering the number of footfalls and for other areas separate allocation should be made. 5 Wherever two sanitary attendants are posted effort should be made to post a female sanitary attendant when other being male . 6 There should b e a dedicated cleaning gang of 4 to 8 sanitary attendants depending upon the size of the healthcare organisation which will be utilized for intensive cleaning and washing of patient care areas and other areas. 2015 18 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 7 Dedicated sanitary attendants may be posted for cleaning of toilets in patient care areas so as to ensure highest level of hygiene and cleanliness. 3.5 Training Staff training and development is a core activity in any department involved in the sanitation service and a structured approach to traini ng should be developed and controlled by Sr. Sanitation Officer , with direct input s from Hospital Administrator, Infection Control Nurses and other relevant healthcare professionals, as required. Organisations should ensure that training is readily accessi ble to all staff involved in the provision of the service , and that training levels and technical competency are standardized throughout shift patterns. (25) As a minimum, training must be given in the performance of cleaning tasks, the use of cleaning equipment, control of infection, manu al handling, fire, health and safety and site orientation. Where there is a change in cleaning products, materials or equipment, retraining of staff will need to be brought forward and completed before the new products are deployed for the first time. (20) All aspects of environmental cleaning must be supervised and p erformed by knowledgeable, trained staff. Regular education and support must be provided by health care organizations and contract agencies to help staff consistently implement appropriate practices. Education should be provided at the initiation of employ ment as part of the orientation process and as ongoing continuing education. (1) Sanitation department must provide a training program that includes: A written curriculum . A mechanism for assessing proficiency. Documentation of training and proficiency verification. Orientation and continuing education. Education provided should include: (1) Handling of mops, cloths, cleaning equipment cleaning and disinfection of blood and body fluids . Handling and application of cle aning agents and disinfectants 2015 19 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Handling of biomedical waste Techniques for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces and item s in the health care environment . The following table gives the frequency of training to be provided as per the risk categorization of functional areas: Table 3 Duration and Frequency of Training of Sanitary Attendants as per risk categorization of patient care areas Functional Risk category Induction Training Refresher Training/ on the job training frequency High risk area 24 hours of intensive training on general cleaning and infection control followed by 7 days of supervised dut ies Training of four hours every month Moderate risk area 16 hours of training on general cleaning and infection control followed by 5 days of supervised duties Once in every months for 2 hours Low risk area 8 hours of training on cleaning practices followed by three days of supervised duties Every six months for 2 hours Induction Training Topics for Sanitary Attendant 1.

Penalties for mis conduct/ not working Training programmes should be systematically applied and may well include a variety of training techniques including 'classroom' and 'on the job' training sessions. Training programmes should be evaluated regularly to ensure that they meet the needs of the service and that staff are able to readily assimilate the information provided to them. On -going training should take cognizance of the outcomes of monitoring reports, skills audits or competency reviews by appropriate responsible per sons or managers. (25) 3.6 Work Pl anning All duties relating to sanitation services must be clearly defined and should be clearly and accurately reflected in job descriptions and in contract document . Work schedules should be as detailed and complete as possible. They should describe each cleaning task to be performed by cleaning staff in a particular area and indicate approximately when it will be done and how long it will take. Work schedules should be agreed between key stakeholders and should be prominently displayed within the work are a they relate to. (20) The optimal resourcing of sanitation ser vices is a priority for all healthcare providers. However, sanitation staff, and sanitation managers and supervisors, must be allowed adequate time to perform their duties. Resource planning should take account of what is realistically achievable. (20) It should be clearly recognised, as part of the work planning proc ess, that events may alter the resource requirement of the cleaning service. For example, the management of infection outbreaks will require additional resource. Such events cannot be forecasted with complete accuracy, but an informed budgetary estimate sh ould always be made and in -year variance assessed during each financial period. (20) 2015 22 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 1 4. Cleaning in Healthcare Organisation Good cleaning practices are essential for reducing the risk of transmitting infectious diseases. This will contribute to a culture of safety by providing an atmosphere of general cleanliness and good order. Cleaning best practices are designed to meet the following needs: (1) The primary focus must remain the safety of the patient , staff and visitors . The practi ces must help reduce the spread of infections. The practices are easily understood and achievable. The practices incorporate workflow measurement to guide human resource issues . The practices must be reviewed as often as required to keep abreast of change s in the health care. Cleaning in the health care organisation should be performed on a routine and consistent basis to provide for a safe and sanitary environment. Maintaining a clean and safe health care environment is an important component of infection prevention and control. (1) 4.1 Environmental Cleaning Sanitation staff must adhere to routine p ractices while cleaning. Routine cleaning practices are practices that a re used wherever cleaning is being carried out . The principles of routine practices are based on the premise that all patient s, their secretions, excretions and body fluids and their environment might potentially be contaminated with harmful microorganisms. By following simple preventive practices at all times regardless of whether or not an illness is 'known', staff will be protecting patients and themselves from an unknown, undiagnosed infectious risk. Routine Practices related to environmental cleaning include: (1) Hand hygiene. Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) when indicated. Standardized cleaning protocols. Hand hygiene is the most important and effective mea sure to prevent the spread of health care -associated infections. Therefore, h and hygiene must be practiced: 2015 23 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Before initial patient/p atient environment contact (e.g. before coming into the patient room or bed space) . After potential body fluid exposure (e. g. after cleaning bathroom, handling soiled linen, equipment or waste etc.). After patient/patient environment contact (e.g., after cleaning patient room; after cleaning equipment such as stretchers; after changing mop heads etc.). Dedicated hand washing s inks are required for hand washing with soap and water, to avoid splash back of microorganisms onto clean hands during rinsing. Hand washing sinks must not be used for other purposes, such as disposal of fluids or cleaning of equipment. (1) Personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers and other staff refers to a variety of barriers used alone or in combination to protect mucous membranes, airways, skin and clothing from contact with infectious agents and from chemical agents. Cleaning staff should wear PPE: (1) For protection from microorganisms. For protection from chemic als used in cleaning. To prevent transmission of microorganisms fro m one patient environment to another. Figure 3 Personal Protective Equipment 2015 24 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Hospital Administrators must ensure that PPE are available adequately and accessible to all sanitary /cleaning staff in their work area . Adequate induction and in -service training should be provided in infection control and use of PPE. PPE includes the following: Heavy duty gloves Impermeable pla stic apron Gum boots Disposable mask and ca ps Eye protection wherever required 4.2 Cleaning Frequency (1) The frequency of cleaning and disinfecting individual items or surfaces in a particular area or department depends on: (1) Whether surfaces are high -touch or low -touch. The type of activity taking place in the area and the risk of infection associated with it (e.g., critical care areas vs. m eeting room) The vulnerability of patien ts in the area . The probability of contamination based on the amount of body fluid contamination surfaces in the area mi ght have or be expected to have. 4.2.1 Frequency of contact with surfaces All s urfaces in a health care organisation have the potential to harbour pathogenic microorganisms. The potential for exposure to pathogens is based on the frequency of contact with a contaminated surface and the type of activity involved. For example, a confer ence room table would have less potential for exposure to pathogens than the doorknob in a patient care area. High -touch surfaces will require more frequent cleaning regimen. (1) Most, if not all, environmental surfaces will be adequately cleaned with soap and water or a detergent/disinfectant, depending on the nature of the surface and the type and degree of contamination. (13) 2015 25 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals High -touch surfaces are those that have frequent contact with hands. Examples include doorknobs, elevator buttons, telep hones, call bells, bedrails, light switches, computer keyboards, monitoring equipment, hemodialysis machines, wall areas around the toilet and edges of privacy curtains. (1) High -touch surfaces in patient care areas require more frequent cleaning and disinfection than minimal contact surfaces. (13) Cleaning and disinfection is usually done at least daily and more frequently if the risk of environmental contamination is higher (e.g., intensive care units). Low-touch surfaces are those that have min imal contact with hands. Examples include walls, ceilings, mirrors and window sills. (1) Low-touch surfaces require cleaning on a regular (but not necessarily daily) basi s, when soiling or spills occur, and when a patient is discharged from the health care setting. (13) Many low -touch surfaces may be cleaned on a periodic basis rather than a daily basis if they are also cleaned when visibly soiled. 4.2.2 Vulnerability of the Patient/Resident Population Different populations of patients have differ ing vulnerabilities based on their susceptibility to infection due to their medical condition or lack of immunity . In some populations, such as bone marrow transplant or burn patients, and those undergoing i nvasive or operative procedures, susceptibility t o infection is very high and may be impacted by their environment. The frequency of cleaning may be higher in areas with vulnerable patient s. For the purpose of risk stratification for cleaning, all other individuals are classified as less susceptible. 4.2.3 Probability of Contamination of Items and Surfaces The probability that a surface, piece of equipment or patient care area will be contaminated is based on the activity in the area, the type of pathogens involved and the microbial load. Areas that are h eavily soiled with blood or other body fluids will require more frequent cleaning and disinfection than areas that are minimally soiled or not soiled. Heavy Contamination An area is considered to be heavily contaminated if surfaces are exposed to copious a mounts of blood or other body fluids (e.g., birthing suite, autopsy suite, cardiac catheterization 2015 26 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals laboratory, burn unit, h aemodialysis unit, Emergency Department, bathroom if the patient has diarrhea or is incontinent). Moderate Contamination An area is c onsidered to be moderately contaminated if surfaces are contaminated with blood or other body fluids as part of routine activity (e.g., patient/resident room, bathroom if patient is continent) and the contaminated substances are contained or removed. All patients' bed space/ rooms and bathrooms should be considered to be, as a minimum, moderately contaminated. Light Contamination An area is considered to be lightly contaminated or not contaminated if surfaces are not exposed to blood, other body fluids . 4.3 Cleaning Practices Each health care setting must have policies and procedures to ensure that: (1) Cleaning is a continuous event in the health care organization . Clean ing procedures incorporate the principles of infection prevention and control . Cleaning standards, frequency and accountability for cleaning are clearly defined (i.e., who cleans, what and how do they clean and when do they clean it). Cleaning schedules en sure that no area is missed from routine cleaning. Statutory requirements are met in relation to: o Biomedical waste management o Environment Protection Act o Food hygiene standards o Pest control Routine cleaning is necessary to maintain a specific level of clea nliness i.e. Hotel Clean, Hospital Clean. Routine cleaning practices must be effective and consistent to reduce the transmission of microorganisms. The frequency of cleaning is dependent upon the risk classification of the surface or item to be cleaned. (1) 2015 27 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Hotel Clean is a measure of cleanliness based on visual appearance that includes dust and dirt removal, waste disposal and cleaning of windows and surfaces. Hotel Clea n is the basic cleaning that takes place in all areas of a health care setting. Hospital Clean is a measure of cleanliness routinely maintained in care ar eas of the health care organisation .(3) Hospital Clean is h otel Cle an with the addition of disinfection, increased frequency of cleaning, evaluation and other infection control measures in patient care areas. Following are the components of hotel clean: (1) Floors and skirtings are free of stains, visible dust, spills and streaks . Walls, ceilings and doors are free of visible dust, gross soil, streaks, spider webs and handprints . All surfaces are free of visible dust or streaks (includes furniture, window ledges, overhead lights, phones etc.) . Bathroom fi xtures including toilets, sinks and showers are free of streaks, soil, stains and soap scum . Mirrors and windows are free of dust and streaks . Dispensers are free of dust, soiling and resi due and replaced/replenished when empty . Appliances are free of dust, soiling and stains . Was te is disposed of appropriately. Items that are broken, torn, cracked or malfunctioning are replaced . The area in general should have an aesthetic appearance. While components of hospital clean are as: HOTEL CLEAN + High -touch surfaces in patient care areas are cleaned and disinfected with a hospital - grade disinfectant + Non-critical medical equipment is cleaned and disinfected between patients + CLEANING PRACTIC ES ARE PERIODICALLY MONITORED AND AUDITED WITH FEEDBACK AND EDUCATION 2015 28 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 4.4 Equipment Cleaning The health care organisation should have written policies and procedures for the appropriate cleaning and disinfection of equipment that clearly define the frequ ency and level of cleaning and assign responsibility for cleaning. Non-critical medical equipment that is within the patient's environment and used between patients (e.g., imaging equipment, electronic monitoring equipment etc. ) requires cleaning and disin fection after each use. Selection of new equipment must include considerations related to effective cleaning and disinfection. A system should be in place to clearly identify equipment which has been cleaned and disinfected. (1) 2015 29 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 5. Risk categorization of hospital areas All healthcare environments should pose minimal risk to patients, staff and visitors. However, different functional areas represent different degrees of risk and, therefore, require different cleaning frequencies , and levels of monitoring and evaluation. (26) A functional area refers to any area in a healthcare facility that requires cleaning. (27) Consequently, all functional areas should be assigned in one of the following three categories: High risk areas Moderate risk areas Low risk areas. Regular monitoring should take pla ce in areas where standards are considered poor or where routine monitoring reveals consistent weaknesses. These functional area risk categories are explained below. (28) 5.1 High Risk Areas Consistently high cleaning standards must be maintained in these areas . Required outcomes will only be achieved through intensive and frequent cleaning. Both informal monitoring and formal evaluation of cleanliness should take pl ace continuously. Patient care areas and other facilities designated as high - risk category should be evaluated at least once a week until the Officer I/C Sanitation and Infection Control Team are satisfied that consistently high standards are being maint ained , after which the frequency of evaluation may be reduced to once monthly. This will be in addition to the routine monitoring done by the Hospital Administrator and Sanitation D epartment i.e., Sanitation Officer, Sanitary Inspector, nursing staff etc. High risk functional areas typically include operating theatres (OTs) , ICUs, HDUs, Emergency department, post operative units, surgical ward, labour room, haemodialysis unit, Central sterile supply department(CSSD)/Theatre sterile supply unit (TSSU) and ot her facilities where invasive procedures are performed or where immuno -compromised patients are receiving 2015 30 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals care. Bathrooms, toilets, staff lounges, offices and other areas adjoining high -risk functional areas should be treated as having the same risk catego ry, and receive the same intensive levels of cleaning. 5.2 Moderate risk areas Outcomes in these areas should be maintained by regular and frequent cleaning with 'spot cleaning' in -between. Both informal monitoring and formal evaluation should take place continuously. Pat ient care areas in this category should be evaluated at least on ce a month until the Officer in charge , Sanitation and Infection Control Team are satisfied that consistently high standards are being maintained , after which the evaluation fr equency may be reduced to once in two months. This will be in addition to the daily monitoring done by the Hospital administrator and Sanitation Department i.e., Sanitation Officer, Sanitary Inspector, nursing staff etc. Moderate -risk areas may include Medical wards, Laboratory areas, Blood bank, Pharmacies, Dietary services, Laundry services, Mortuary, Nurses/ Doctors rest rooms, Rehabilita tion Areas and Psychiatric wards . Bathrooms, toilets, staff lounges, offices and other areas adjoining high -risk func tional areas should be treated as having the same risk category and receive the same regular levels of cleaning. (28) 5.3 Low -risk areas In these areas, high standar ds are required for aesthetic and to a lesser extent, hygiene reasons. Outcomes should be maintained by regular and frequent cleaning with 'spot cleaning' in -between. Both informal monitoring and formal evaluation of standards should take place continuousl y. Patient care and other areas within a low -risk area should be evaluated at every three months. This will be in addition to the daily monitoring done by the sanitation department i.e. Hospital administrator, Sanitation Officer, Sanitary Inspector, nursin g staff etc. Low-risk functional areas may include administrative areas, faculty and doctors offices, seminar rooms, stores, staff rooms, non- sterile supply areas, record storage and archives etc. Additional internal areas bathrooms, staff lounges, office s and other areas adjoining 2015 31 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals low-risk functional areas should be treated as having the same risk category and receive the same level of cleaning. The following given table describes the various hospital areas stratified according to risk categories: Table 4 Classification of Hospital areas into risk categories High Risk areas Moderate risk areas Low risk areas Operation theatre units including recovery area - Major & minor Medical and allied wards Departmental areas/office areas Intensive care units/ Cardiac care units/Neonatal ICU etc. Laboratory areas Outpatient department High dependency units Blood bank Non sterile supply areas Emergency department/casualty Pharmacies Libraries Labour room Dietary services Meeting Rooms Post operative units Laundry services Medical records section Surgical wards Mortuary Stores section Central sterile supply department/Theatre sterile supply unit Nurses/ Doctors rest rooms Manifold services/room Radiation Treatment Areas Rehabilitation Ar eas Telephone rooms, electrical, mechanical, External surroundings Chemotherapy ward/room Psychiatric wards Staff areas Renal Dialysis facility Burn Units Isolation wards/ rooms & attached internal areas like bathrooms / toilets 2015 32 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Taking cue an d extending the logic of Spaulding's classification to environmental cleaning , the following level of disinfection is recommended for different risk categories : Table 5 Cleaning frequency, level of cleaning/disinfection and evaluati on/auditing frequency according to the type of functional area risk category Functional Area Risk Category Frequency of cleaning Level of cleaning/disinfection Method of cleaning/Disinfection (29) Evaluation/auditing frequency High risk areas Once in two hours and spot cleaning as required Cleaning and Intermediate level disinfection Cleaning with soap & detergent plus disi nfection with alcohol compound, aldehyde compounds (Formaldehyde, glutardehyde) hydrogen peroxide and phenolics (not feasible in the nurseries) Weekly or monthly if cleanliness of high standards is maintained as certified by Officer I/C Sanitation and Infection Control Team Moderate risk areas Once in four hours and spot cleaning as required Cleaning and low level disinfection Cleaning with soap & detergent plus disinfection with aldehyde compounds (Formaldehyde, glutardehyde) hydrogen peroxide phenolics Once in a month or once in two months if cleanliness of high standards is maintained as certified by Officer I/C Sanitation and Infection Control Team Low risk areas For areas working round the clock at least once in a shift or in areas having general shift at least twice in the shift & Spot cleaning as required Only cleaning Physical removal of soil, dust or foreign material followed by cleaning with water and detergent Once in three months 2015 33 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 6. Standard Operating procedures for cleaning 6.1 General Clean ing Practices for All Health Care Settings (1) Before cleaning: Check for additional precautions signs. Follow precautions as indicated. Remove clutter before cleanin g. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper dilution and contact time for cleaning and disinfecting solutions. Gather materials required for cleaning before entering the room. Clean hands before entering the room. During cleaning: Progress from the least soiled areas (low -touch) to the most soiled areas (high -touch) and from high surfaces to low surfaces. Remove gross soil (visible to naked eye) prior to cleaning and disinfection. Minimize turbulence to prevent the dispersion of dust tha t may con tain microorganisms. Never shake mops. Use dust control mop prior to wet/ damp mop. Wash the mop under the running water before doing wet mopping. Do not 'double -dip' cloths (dip the mop only once in the cleaning solution, as dipping it multiple times ma y recontaminate it) . An area of 120 square feet to be mopped before re-dipping the mop in the solution. (30) Cleaning solution to be chan ged after cleaning an area of 24 0square feet. (30) Where facility of laundering mops is not available, mops should be changed at following defined intervals: o High risk areas - In each shift o Moderate risk areas - Each day o Low risk areas - Every week 2015 34 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Change cleaning solutions as per manufacturer's instructi ons. Change more frequently in heavily contaminated areas, when visibly soiled and immediately after cleaning blood and body fluid spills. Be alert for needles and other sharp objects. Safely handle and dispose sharps into puncture proof container. Report incident to supervisor. Collect waste, handle plastic bags from the top (do not compress bags with hands). Clean hands on leaving the room. After cleaning: Do not overstock rooms. Tools used for cleaning and disinfecting must be cleaned and dried between uses. Launder mop heads daily. All washed mop heads must be dried thoroughly before re -use. Clean sanitation cart and carts used to transport biomedical waste daily. All attachments of machines should be removed, emptied, cleaned and dried before storin g. 6.2 Cleaning of Patient Care Area/Room 6.2.1 Daily Routine Patient Bed Space / Room Cleaning Hospital Clean ing of patient care area s/rooms should follow a methodical, planned format that in cludes the following elements: (1) 1. Assessment: a. Check for a dditional precautions signs and follow the precautions indicated . b.

Provision for timely response . A method for the containment and isolation of the spill . Training of staff who will clean the spill . Access to PPE, equipment, supplies, waste and linen disposal for staff who will c lean the spill. Proper disposal of waste . Procedure to be followed if there is a staff exposure to biological material . Documentation of the spill incident. 6.10.1 Cleaning a Biological Spill * Assemble materials required for dealing with the spill prior to putting on PPE. Inspect the area around the spill thoroughly for splatters or splashes. 2015 46 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Restrict the activity around the spill until the area has been cleaned and disinfected and is completely dry. Put on gloves; if there is a possibility of splashing, wear a gown and facial protection (mask and eye protection or face shield). Confine and contain the spill; wipe up any blood or body fluid spills immediately using either disposable towels or a product designed for this purpose. Dispose off materials by p lacing them into regular waste receptacle, unless the soiled materials are so wet that blood can be squeezed out of them, in which case they must be segregated into the biomedical waste container (i.e., yellow bag). Disinfect the entire spill area with a h ospital -grade disinfectant and allow it to stand for the amount of contact time recommended by the manufacturer. Wipe up the area again using disposable towels and discard into regular waste. Care must be taken to avoid splashing or generating aerosols d uring the clean up. Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene. * Adapted from Health Canada's Hand Washing, Cleaning, Disinfection and Sterilization in Health Care, 1998 (p. 32) and Fallis, P. Infection prevention and control in office -based health care and allied systems, 2004. 6.11 Stain R emoval Principle s of stain removal : 1. All stains should as far as possible, be removed while still fresh. 2. Before using any reagent, it should be tested on a hidden or small portion of the surface. 3. If the nature of the stain unknown, it should be treated first by the least harmful method, passing on from one process to next more active until an effective reagent is reached. 4. The nature and texture of the surface should be borne in mind while selecting the reagent for stain rem oval. 5. The reagent bottle should be tightly capped after each use. 6. The room should have good ventilation. 2015 47 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 7. After stain removal, the reagent should be neutralized. An acidic solution is neutralized with an alkaline one and vice -versa. A thorough rinsing with clean water is essential after each treatment. Table 7 Stain removal from floors Type of stain Methodology Rust Apply a poultice of sodium citrate, glycerine, precipitate of calcium carbonate and water. Let it dry and scrape off. Ink From marble and terrazzo - apply a poultice of sodium perborate and turpentine oil. Let it dry and scrape off. Chewing Gum Harden with ice, scrape off. If stain is left, rub with steel wool dipped in cleanser, rinse dry and polish. Acid Clean with d ilute general purpose cleaner. Neutralize with ammonia. If stain persists , use steel wool dipped with cleanser. Rinse dry & polish. Blood Rub with concentrated cleanser and in case of stubborn stains use zero degree steel wool dipped in cleanser. Rinse d ry and polish Table 8 Stain removal from polished wood Type of stain Methodology Ink Mop it as quickly as possible. Rub with fine steel wool or use hot solution of a weak acid and then rinse. In both cases, the stain, colour and polish will be removed.

Cleani ng Agents and Disinfectants Cleaning is the removal of foreign material (e.g., dust, soil, organic material such as blood, secretions, excretions and microorganisms) from a surface or object. Cleaning physically removes rather than kills microorganisms, r educing the organism load on a surface. It is accomplished with water, detergents and mechanical action. The key to cleaning is the use of friction to remove microorganisms and debris. Thorough cleaning is required for any equipment/device to be disinfecte d, as organic material may inactivate a disinfectant. This may be accomplished through a two -step process involving a cleaner followed by a disinfectant, but is more commonly accompl ished in the health care organisation through a one-step process using a c ombined cleaner/disinfector product. (1) Disinfection is a process used on inanimate objects and surfaces to kill microorganisms. Disinfection will kill most disease -caus ing microorganisms but may not kill all bacterial spores. Only sterilization will kill all forms of microbial life. (1) Detergents remove organic material and suspend gr ease or oil. Equipment and surfaces in the health care setting must be cleaned with approved hospital -grade cleaners and disinfectants. Equipment cleaning/disinfection should be done as soon as possible after items have been used. A variety of products fro m a number of suppliers can be used to achieve effective cleaning. It is important to follow the manufacturer's instructions when using cleaning agents. (1) Hospital -grad e disinfectants for use in all health care settings include: Alcohols o 60-90% ethyl or isopropyl Quaternary Ammonium Compounds ('QUATs') Iodophors Hydrogen Peroxides (1) 2015 50 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Table 10 Advantages and Disadvantages of Hospital -grade Disinfectants and Sporicides Used for Environmental Cleaning (1) Process Option Uses/Comments Advantages/Comments Disadvantages /Comments Alcohols (70 -95%) External surfaces of some equipment (e.g., stethoscopes) Noncritical equipment used for home health ca re Disinfection is achieved after 10 minutes of contact.

Rapid action Safe for the environment Non-toxic Contraindicated for use on copper, zinc, brass, aluminum Store in cool place, protect from light 2015 54 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals General principles while using a hospital disinfectant: (1) It is most important that an item or surface be free from visible soil and other items that might interfere with the action of the disinfectant, such as adhesive products, before a dis infectant is applied, or the disinfectant will not work. A hospital -grade disinfectant may be used for equipment that only touches intact skin. It is important that the disinfectant be used according to the manufacturer's instructions for dilution and co ntact time. Minimize the contamination levels of the disinfectant solution and equipment used for cleaning. This can be achieved by ensuring proper dilution of the disinfectant, frequently changing the disinfectant solution and by not dipping a soiled clot h into the disinfectant solution (i.e., no 'double -dipping'). Personal protective equipment must be worn appropriate to the product(s) used. There should be a quality monitoring system in place to ensure the efficacy of the disinfectant over time (e.g., fr equent testing of product). 2015 55 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 8. Equipment used for cleaning The following is the list of a dvised equipment which can be used for sanitation purposes. The list is not exhaustive and different hospitals can identify the number and types as per their organiza tional characteristics and workload . a) Heavy d uty scrubber dryer b) Ride o n scrubbers c) Walk behind scrubbers d) Vacuum Cleaner wet & dry e) High Pressure Jet Cleaners/Washer f) Road Sweeper (Manual and ride on Machine/vehicle ) g) Scrubbing & Vacuuming (Combined) h) Small b attery operated scrubber Machine i) Polishing & Cleaning Machine j) Double bucket wringer trolleys/Multi use trolleys/ Bucket carrying trolleys k) Spray pump for pest control as per (Indian Pest Control Association) IPCA recommendations l) Rubber squeezers m) Ladder (24ft and 12ft) n) Scissor Ladders o) Dust Control mop p) Caddy Baskets q) Any other Cleaning Equipment as per the need / requirement of the hospital 2015 56 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 9. Biomedical Waste Management Biomedical waste may be defined as \"Any waste , generated during the diagnosis, treatment o r immunization of human beings or animals or in research activities pertaining thereto or in the production or testing of biological. \" It is very important to have proper biomedical waste management and handling system as prescribed in the Biomedical Waste (Management and Handling Rules ) 1998, otherwise it exposes the patients, visitors and staff to following hazards: Transmission of infections for e.g. hepatitis B, HIV, other microbes etc. Mechanical injury Re-circulation of waste Air pollution Water pollu tion Land pollution Fire Breeding of flies and insects Proliferation of rodents Loss of aesthetics Nuclear waste hazards & carcinogenic effects With regards to biomedical waste management, following are some of the key functions of hospital administration: To get authorization of State Pollution Control Committee/ State Pollution Control Board To ensure the effective implementation of all the provisions of the Biomedical Waste Management and Handling Rules 1998. 2015 57 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Constitute BMW management committee Identify and designate a nodal officer as Officer I/c Survey and evaluation of waste generated in the hospital Identification of locations for placement of bins/ equipment Procurement of equipment, materials and supplies (colour coded bins, bags, needle destroyer, puncture proof containers , colour coded covered waste collection trolleys etc.) Source reduction by encouraging reusable Strategy implementation by o Proper segregation as per policy o Proper collection and transportation o Adequate treatment and disposal Contr act finalization with outside agency Safety measures for all categories of staff Awareness and training - all categories Segregation of biomedical waste is the most important step in the management of Biomedical Waste. The biomedical waste from different pa tient care areas should be collected and transported to the central biomedical waste collection facility by the hospital attendant or by the staff of the agency to whom biomedical waste disposal services are being outsourced. The various collection points may be identified within the healthcare organisation for handing over the biomedical waste to the outsourced agency under the supervision of sister i/c or staff of that patient care area. For further details, Biomedical Waste (Management and Handling ) Rules 1998 and its subsequent amendments may be referred. 2015 58 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 10. Pest control Pest control is an integral component of sanitation services . For hospitals of 200 bedded or more, separate tender can be floated for work by specializing agencies, in smaller hospitals , the same housekeeping tender shall include pest control services. The following points should be taken into consideration while drawing the terms and conditions of the contract for pest control agency: Functional details Manpower details Details of chemi cals to be used Quality control. 11.1 Functional details It should contain the scope of work for pest control services and the t otal floor area provided 11.2 Chemicals details This is the most important component for outsourcing of pest control services a nd due care should be taken while drafting the terms and conditions. Only those chemicals should be used i n hospital setting, which are fit for usage in healthcare setting. Details of chemicals should contain - Name of chemical , Name of company, Concentra tion, Chemical composition, Quantity consumed , Size of packing , Batch no , Manufacturing & expiry date Chemical Procurement Quality Certification - by using chemicals certified by only following bodies WHOPES (World Health Organisation Pesticide Evaluation Scheme) CIB (Central Insecticide board) BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) Details of chemicals and alternate chemicals Small stock of antidote 2015 59 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals No open baiting Periodicity of spraying chemicals 11.3 Manpower details Supervisor Workers Vendor license - Plan t protection officer, Ministry of Agriculture , Govt. of Delhi 11.4 Quality control Records of application Emergency calls Monthly feedback Application of chemicals Attending emergency calls Pest Evaluation Rat, cockroaches, mosquito, flies, bed bugs, term ite Good, average, poor Penalty clauses Rs. 1000/ - per adverse event (unsatisfactory report from the user area) 2015 60 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 11. Storage of Cleaning Supplies and Utility Rooms All chemical cleaning agents and disinfectants should be appropriately labeled and stored in a manner that eliminates risk of contamination, inhalation, skin contact or personal injury. Chemical s must be clearly labeled and a Material Safety Data Sheet ( MSDS ) must be readily available for each item in case of accidents. If a refillable bottle is fi lled with a disinfectant solution, it should never be topped up with fresh disinfectant. Always use a clean, dry, appropriately -sized bottle, label the product and date it. The product should be discarded when past the expiry date for stability. (1) Equipment used to clean toilets (e.g., toilet brushes, toilet swabs) should not be carried from room -to-room. If feasible, the toilet brush may remain in the room; if not, cons ideration should be given to using disposable toilet swabs. Toilet cleaning and disinfecting equipment should be discarded when the patient leaves or as required. In patient care cubicles having multiple beds , a system should be developed for replacement o f toilet brushes on a regular basis or as required. When choosing a tool for cleaning toilets, consideration should be given to equipment that will minimize splashing. (1) The following areas are deemed to be essentially provided for efficient and effective functioning of sanitation services: 1. Sitting room/staff room: To be utilised by both for sanitary attendants, hospital attendants and other group D staff of that area. 2. Sluice room: For storing dirty supplies (linen, biomedical waste etc.) . A dedicated area shall be provided within the sluice room for washing and cleaning of mops as well as other sanitary equipments. 3. Storage space for cleaning supplies/ Janitors closet: Janitors closet shall be provided in each area for storage of supplies by the sanitary attendant meant for sanitation for e.g. dust control, swivel brush, mops etc. 2015 61 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 12. Assessment of Cleanliness and Quality Control (1) The Sanitation department is responsible to ensure that the quality of cleaning maintained in the health care organisation meets appropriate best practices. The responsibility for ensuring that the standardized cleaning practices are adhered to lies not just with the person performing the task but also with the direct supervisor and management of the department or agency providing the sanitation service s. To that end, it is important to incorporate elements of q uality improvement into the program, including monitoring, audits and feedback to staff and management. (1) Monitoring should be an ongoing activity built into the routin e cleaning regimen. Regularly scheduled monitoring should take place immediately after cleaning, to ensure that the cleaning has been carried out correctly and to an appropriate standard. Data from monitoring should be retained and used in trend analysis a nd compared with benchmark values that have been obtained during the validation of the sanitation program. (33) Evaluating the cleanliness of the health care organisation periodically and whenever changes to methodologies are made is essential to ensure that achievable cleanliness standards are maintained and to ensure consistency of standards throughout time in changing circumstances. Audits should: (1) Be measurable Highlight areas of good performance , facilitate positive feedback and identify areas for improvement Provide a measurement that may be used as a quality indicator. Round the year, Hospital Administration should monitor all areas . It should cover monitoring of a proportion of the facilities/areas within Hospital or may be entire hospital in a phase wise manner. It is recommended that compliance is assessed using a standardized monit oring template. The purpose of the peer review audit is to provide a degree of independent scrutiny within the monitoring system. The peer review process may include 2015 62 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals representation from the following, accompanied by a representative from Sanitation Service s.(1) Officer I/C Sanitation. A member of the public . An Infection Control team member . Sanitary Inspector/Sanitation Officer . A member of the Quality Team . Civil Engi neer. It is important to identify and use both cost and quality information to assess performance. Comparing processes across organisations (e.g. how the job is done, how the service is provided) should also be part of benchmarking activity, as context oft en enables comprehension of numerical and qualitative data. (25) The outsourced agency should submit the following reports to the Hospital Administration or Officer I/C Sanitation or sanitation officer: i. A daily report of staff on duty in all the shifts ii. A daily report of the status of the e quipment and its utilization iii. A daily report of the washing undertaken iv. A daily report of the chemicals and the consumables used v. A daily report of the general sanitation from the Sanitation Officer or any other officer deputed for the purpose based on the de signated Performa vi. A monthly feedback report from the user areas as based on Turnaround time (TAT) and Key Performance Indicators (KPI). vii. A centralized complaint reporting and redressal mechanism to be manned by the bidder. The redressal has to be certified by the complainant. viii. Any other reporting mechanism as desired by the Institute. The feedback mechanism for the reporting of performance should be three tiers as given below: i. Feedback received from the sanitation department itself 2015 63 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals ii. Feedback received from the end user iii. Feedback received from the hospital administration There are several methods of evaluation available to determine if effective cleaning has taken place, including traditional observation of the environment following cleaning as well as newer tech nologies that show promise in assessing routine cleaning practices in health care settings: (1) Direct and indirect observation (e.g., visual assessment, observation of p erformance, patient/resident satisfaction surveys) Residual bioburden (e.g., environmental culture, adenosine triphosphate - ATP - bioluminescence) . Environmental marking tools (e.g., fluorescent marking). Fast, reproducible, and reliable methods are neede d for environmental cleaning evaluation in order to predict timely clinical risk. (34) The followin g table provides the various advantages and disadvantages of different kind of methodologies adapted for evaluation of cleaning practices. The institution as per their competency and financial capability can choose any of the below given methods for evalua tion of cleanliness. Table 11 Summary of methodologies (34) Advantages Disadvantages Assessing Performance Visual inspection Can be used for large areas (wards, rooms) Can be done with minimal training Benchmarking possible, simple and inexpensive Subjective Does not assess bioburden Does not correlate with bioburden Can be confounded by clutter, fabric deficits and odours Fluorescent gel Quick 2015 64 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Provides immediate feedback on performance Minimal training required Objective Benchmarking possible Relatively inexpensive Does not assess bioburden Could be labour intensiv e as surfaces must be marked before cleaning and checked post cleaning Assessing Outcome ATP bioluminescence Quick Provides immediate feedback Minimal training required Objective Expensive Low sensitivity and specificity No current standardisation o f tests Variable benchmarks Technology constantly changing Microbial cultures High sensitivity and specificity Objective Provides direct indication of the presence of whatever pathogen is isolated May suggest environmental guidelines reservoir(s) and/or source of outbreak Expensive Prolonged time for results Requires accessible laboratory resources and trained personnel for interpreting results Not supported for routine use by local and international guidelines Few laboratories NATA accredited to perform these Outbreak tests Requires standardised benchmark to assess infection risk 2015 65 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 13.

Occupa tional Health and Safety (1) Sanitation staffs are exposed to chemical agents and may be exposed to the same infectious agents in the workplace as are healt h care providers. Many tasks may require the use of personal protective equipment for protection from chemicals or microorganisms. There are also many ergonomic issues related to housekeeping activities, such as pushing, pulling, lifting and twisting. (1) Occupational Health and Safety Issues include staff immunization, appropriate use of PPE, staff exposures to blood and body fluids and other infection hazards, work restr ictions and staff safety issues. There must be written policies and procedures for the evaluation of staff (employees or contract workers) who are, or may be, exposed to blood or body fluids and other infectious hazards that include: A sharps injury p reven tion program (19) Timely post -exposure follow -up and prophylaxis when indicated (19) A respiratory protection program if staffs are entering an airborne infection isolation room and a mechanism for following staff that have been exposed to tuberculo sis review. Reporting of exposures to appropriate authorities . Personal Protective Equipment, or PPE, may be defined as all equipment, including clothing affording protection against the weather, which is intended to be worn or held by a person at work and which protects him/her against one or more risks to his/her health and safety. PPE is to be supplied and used at work whenever there are risks to health and safety that cannot be adequately controlled in any other way. PPE must be: (20) Properly assessed before use to ensure that it is suitable; Maintained an d stored properly; Provided with instruc tions on how to use it safely; Used correctly by employees. 2015 71 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Selection of housekeeping cleaning equipment must follow ergonomic principles. Care should be taken in the choice of buckets, mops and other materials. Due to the repetitive nature of many of the tasks, products that are lighter in weight, easily emptied and having proper handle length help reduce the risk of injury. 2015 72 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 15. Evaluation of Bids for Outsourcing of Sanitation Services The bidder should fulfill all the eligible criteria for qualification as prescribed by respective healthcare organisation . The tendering evaluation shall be done on weightage with 70% to Technical Evaluation and 30% to financial evaluation . 16.1 Technical Bid Evaluation Criteria The technical bid evaluation committee should b e constituted by the hospital to evaluate the Technical Proposals on the basis of their responsiveness to the tender terms, applying the evaluation criteria, sub -criteria and point system specified. During the technical evaluation stage, each bidder shall be assigned different marks out of a total of 100 marks, as p er the criteria specified below. The following table gives the evaluation criteria illustrative for a 1000 bedded hospital. The values can be determined by respective hospitals depending on their requirements. 60 marks shall be minimum score for qualification in the technical bid. Illustration 1 (for Technical Weightage) If a Bidder has secured 80 marks out of the total 100 marks in technical evaluation, the technical evaluation score shall be: 56 i.e. {80 x 70%) 16.2 Financial/ Price Bid evaluation Criteria: The financial evaluation shall be carried out and financial bids of all the bidders shall be given 30% of weightage. The Bidder with the lowest bid Prices (L1) shall be assigned full 30 marks (i.e. 30% x 100) . Illustration 2 If, the b idder at Illustration 1 is L1 and quoted Rs.100/ -, then his total score shall be 86 i.e. (56 Technical Score + 30 Financial Score ). The financial scores of the other bidders (i.e. L2, L3... and so on) shall be comput ed as under and as explained at illustration 3 below: 30 x Lowest Price (L1 Price) / Quoted Price (L2 OR L3 ....) 2015 73 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Table 12 Technical criteria and weightage matrix for evaluation (Total: 100 marks ) S.No. Criteria 1.

Visit to healthcare organisation where the bidder is providing sanitation services 10 marks 15 marks 2015 74 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Illustration 3 If the Bidder at Illustration 1 is L2 Bidder an d he quoted Rs.125, therefore 30% being the weighted value, the financial scores for L2 shall be computed as under 30 x 100 (lowest pricesL1) / 125 (quoted prices - L2) = 24 (financial score) Therefore L2 Bidder shall have total value of 80 (56 Technical Value + 24 Financial Value) 16.3 Financial Bid Evaluation and Determination of the Successful Bidder The Bidder meeting the minimum eligibility criteria and with the highest marks/ rank (i.e. the total of technical evaluation marks and financial evaluation marks) shall be deemed as the successful Bidder and shall be considered eligible L1 Bidder for further process. 2015 75 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 16. Additional Considerations (1) 17.1 Cleaning Food Prepa ration Areas These guidelines does not address sanitation practices required for facility kitchens, cafeterias, commercial food premises or any area where food is prepared or stored (e.g., unit kitchens). Healthcare organisations should have policies and p rocedures that address the cleaning of these areas that follow the requirements of food safety regulations . 17.2 Construction and Containment Construction activities generate dust and contaminants that may pose a risk to patients, staff or visitors in all health care organisations . Where ver required, work must be performed under appr opriately controlled conditions .(19) Cleaning is of particular importance both during construction and after completion of the construction project. What is considered to be 'clean' may be in terpreted differently by contractors and hospital/ health care staff: 'Construction Clean' is the level of cleaning performed by construction workers to remove gross soil, dust and dirt, construction materials and workplace hazards within the construction zone. (3) This is done at the end of the day, or more frequently if needed, to avoid accumulation of dust. o Floors are swept to remove debris o Large pieces of dry wall, wiring etc. are removed o Work surfaces may be wiped clean Hotel Clean and Hospital Clean begin where the construction site ends, i.e., outside the hoarding, and are generally done by the staff of the health care setting. It is important that there is good liaison between the contractor, and housekeeping. The level of cleaning that is expected during construction and at commissioning must be stated in the contract and the responsibility for cleaning both the job site and adjacent areas must be clearly defined. Where ver there is transport of construction materials (both clean and used materials) through the health care organisation , a clear plan for traffic flow that bypasses care areas as much as possible must be established and adhered to. 2015 76 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals 17.3 Environmental Cleaning f ollowing Flooding In the event of a flood (e.g ., overflow from system , toilet, and sewer ), the area must be immediately assessed by Infection Control team to determine the risk of contamination. Until confirmed as a clean water source, all staff should assume that the water is contaminated. Immediate contamination may occur if the source of the flood water harbours pathogenic bacteria (e.g., sewer or toilet overflow) and the area will need to be cordoned off until cleaning and disinfection are completed. If the flooding involves a food preparation area , all food products that have come into contact with flood water must be discarded and Public Health notified. Public Health must also be notified if vaccine refrigerators are involved in a flood or if flooding leads to a prolonged power outage that compro mises food or vaccine refrigeration. 17.4 New and Evolving Technologies New methods for cleaning and disinfection are continually evolving. Some, such as the use of microfiber technology for surface cleaning and mopping, have been quite successful and are now widely used. Before considering a change from current methods for cleaning and disinfection in a health care setting, the newer product must be weighed against current products in terms of efficacy, ease of implementation, toxicity, effects on patient care, ergonomic considerations and cost implications. Hospital administration, Infection Control Department and Sanitation Department must be involved in all decision -making relating to changes in cleaning and disinfection methodologies and products in the health care setting. Microfib er Microfibers (MF) are densely constructed polyester and polyamide (nylon) fibers that are approximately 1/16 t he thickness of a human hair. (35) The positively charged microfibers attract dust and bacteria (which have a negative charge), using a combination of static attraction and capillary action, from the su rface pores of most surface and flooring materials and hold it tightly so that it is not redistributed around the room during cleaning. MF materials are more absorbent than conventional cloths or cotton -loop mops, enabling them to hold six times their weig ht in water. (35) MF materials can be wet wi th disinfectants. 2015 77 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals Figure 5 Microfiber Mops Ultra -microfibers (UMF) are thinner than regular MF and are woven from a continuous strand. They are designed to be used with low volumes of water containing neither detergent nor biocidal additives. Ultra -microfiber is used fo r cloths used in cleaning. Microfiber Mops A microfiber mop consists of a synthetic pad fit on a plastic handle. MF mop pads provide a cleaning surface 40 times greater than conventional string mops and increased absorbency. In a 2007 study, (36) an MF mop and bucket were compar ed with traditional mop and bucket system; the MF system demonstrated superior microbial removal compared to cotton string mops used with a detergent cleaner. The use of a disinfectant did not improve the microbial elimination demonstrated by the MF system , suggesting that a disinfectant is not required when using an MF mop for cleaning floors. Microfib er and Ultra -microfiber Cloths MF cloths may be used either dry for dusting or wet for general -purpose cleaning. When used dry on a dry surface, MF cloths do not perform better than other types of materials at 2015 78 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals reducing bioburden or or ganicmaterial, (37) but may be better for dusting due to its electrostatic properties. When wet, however, MF cloths remove significantly more soil than general -purpose cloths or paper towel and transfer significantly less organic debris than general -purpose cloths. (37) UMF cloths conform bet ter to surfaces containing small abrasions invisible to the naked eye, in which bacteria might lodge and remain after passage of convention al cotton or wet loop cloths. UMF cloths are particularly effective on older surfac es containing micro -fissures. (38) Some UMF cloths are designed to be used without disinfectants. Product claims should be validated before use. 2015 79 National Guidelines for Clean Hospitals References: 1. Provincial Infectious Diseases Advisory Committee (PIDAC).
