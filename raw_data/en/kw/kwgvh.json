Knowledge transfer Cognitive systems - natural and artificial - sense, act, think, feel, communicate, learn andevolve. These capabilities exist in many forms in living organisms. For example, 'systems'as diverse as colonies of ants and human brains achieve sophisticated adaptivebehaviours. As computing power grows, and pervades more and more devices, there isgrowing interest in transferring our understanding of natural cognitive systems to thechallenges of building 'smart things'. Medicine and health, education, transport and how we wage wars will all change as information technology becomes more 'cognitive'. At the extreme end, would youwelcome the idea of connecting your brain to the Internet? Artificial cognitive systems are taking computing in many directions - each involving huge areas of commercial and societal activity. While it is unwise to rely on predictions of theshape of things to come, considering potential applications does at least show us some ofthe areas where we need to anticipate the outcomes, desirable and undesirable, from thearrival of artificial cognitive systems. A networked world The core components of computing and communications are becoming cheap enough for 'anything' to connect to the web. In the short term that means smart phones, TVs, cameras,hi-fi, car navigation. In the near future, look for the Internet presence of any artefact for whichthere is a reason to connect - if it makes sense for a coffee cup to be online, it will be. The move to put everything on line is changing the model for computing. A web designedfor people to seek information is changing to become an 'Ambient Web' that canaccommodate objects that need to interact. One development here is of 'agents',autonomous software entities that can act and react with each other in a distributedenvironment. How will we regulate and police systems in which bits of software do our bidding, booking holidays for us, participating in on-line auctions or taking the steering wheel of ourcars, for example? While we may be able to predict how an individual agent or piece of technology will behave, we cannot forecast the outcomes of all the possible interactions of many millionsof semi-autonomous devices. How are we to devise systems that can cope with suchunpredictable emergent behaviour? We have already seen early examples of this, inprogrammed trading on stock exchanges, creating cascades of unintended transactions. A personal digital environment Much of the change we will see will come from our ability to carry a growing number ofsimple and capable devices, a move toward a personal digital environment (PDE), withfully connected technology at the scale of credit cards, jewellery, glasses, spectacles,wristwatches and so on. There will be intelligence in anything that is most convenient inour personal environment.Foresight Cognitive Systems Project Applications and impact One likely development of the PDE is the mobile medical monitor. It starts with a PDA reminding you to take your pills but quickly moves on to devices that can tell asthmaticsabout air conditions or monitor the cardiac status of heart patients. Bionic beings The use of imaging techniques to map brain activity while people undertake controlledtasks is increasing our knowledge of which parts of the brain do what. One consequenceof this knowledge could be feedback devices to monitor, and let us control, the brain'sstate when learning new tasks. Other possibilities include implanted chips to treat a widerange of cognitive dysfunctions, such as autism or Parkinson's disease. Other implants could control prosthetic devices, raising the prospects of devices in which individuals engage with sophisticated real-time feedback to influence the performance notjust of their brains but of their bodies. Robotics is set to become a key driver of prosthetictechnology because there is intrinsic scientific, technological and commercial interest ingiving autonomous machines the sensory, movement and control capabilities of humansand animals. Like many other potential technologies involving artificial cognitive systems, these medical applications - a tiny glimpse of what could be possible - raise numerous ethical, social andlegal issues. They could also change our relationships with the technologies we use. The cost and availability of advanced new medical technologies is bound to emerge as a major concern for public policy. Transport skids into dilemmas Expect to see equally challenging issues in transport and other key areas of life. Today weare accustomed to the idea that an anti-lock braking system (ABS) can help us to operateour car more safely. Car manufacturers are already researching advanced forms of vehiclecontrol and driver assistance that will radically change how we drive. Artificial systems can learn and tune control algorithms over millions of hours of simulated and real driving. It can surely only be a matter of time before we start to prefer automatedcontrol to the human variety. But what happens if the best way for 'intelligent' vehicles tosave lives in a crash is to make matters worse for one driver? Even without having to tackle such dilemmas, we will face many issues of investment and risk management. Testing, responsibility and accountability will all need to be radicallyre-thought. What will it mean to take a driving test on a vehicle that is more competentthan you are under many circumstances? Will cars limit your ability to control them to theexpertise level you have built up through actual driving? We will face similar challenges as artificial cognitive systems make inroads into entertainment, education and military activities. An artificial new world At some point in our evolutionary past, humans entered the 'cognitive niche',fundamentally changing their relationship to the world around them and the rate at whichthey could develop their culture. The artificial world is about to do the same, with humansas partners in the process. The effects will be equally far reaching.
