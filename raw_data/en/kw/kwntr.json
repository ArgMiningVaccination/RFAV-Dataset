( [source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170330115246.htm)) However, guzzling orange juice or taking a mega dose of vitamin C in one sitting isn't going to help much. That's because vitamin C is water soluble, which means your body will just eliminate the excess. Most mamas find that dividing your daily dose throughout the day helps to avoid losing this vitamin through your urine.

Get plenty of zinc While [zinc](https://mamanatural.com/zinc-deficiency/) is likely to be included in most multivitamins or [prenatal vitamins](https://mamanatural.com/best-prenatal-vitamins/), you can still boost your immune system by choosing zinc-rich foods. Oysters are the number one source of zinc. One 3-ounce servings contains a whopping 493 percent of your daily recommended value! ( [source](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/)) Other sources include: - 3 ounces of [ beef chuck](https://mamanatural.com/iron-rich-foods/) (47 percent DV) - 1 ounce of cashews (11 percent DV) - 1 serving of oatmeal (7 percent DV) You can also find zinc in a [supplement form](https://www.amazon.com/MegaFood-Mineral-Recovery-Broccoli-Gluten-Free/dp/B00GZ9GVHG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1538140670&sr=1-6&keywords=organic+zinc+supplement&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=e7b3dcd225778d17e05558ab0aaa8d28&language=en_US). 10. Eat mushrooms Perhaps you've seen the explosion in mushroom-related products? There's even [mushroom coffee](https://www.amazon.com/Four-Sigmatic-Mushroom-Organic-mushrooms/dp/B0756D1D39/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B0756D1D39&pd_rd_r=7c3adeee-c0fa-11e8-811e-95119e74d328&pd_rd_w=9XkNY&pd_rd_wg=0YlFe&pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=18bb0b78-4200-49b9-ac91-f141d61a1780&pf_rd_r=5HZSTVTWSNSBFTG42YY0&pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_t=40701&refRID=5HZSTVTWSNSBFTG42YY0&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=1cf3886831812457fc56cb461505148a&language=en_US)! There's a good reason for this. Mushrooms are really quite good for you, and they can even support a healthy immune system.

Pretty cool! Time to add reishi and shiitake mushrooms to your shopping list. 11. Get your beta-glucans So you want the benefits of beta-glucans, but you're not into mushrooms? No problem! You can find beta-glucans in plenty of foods besides mushrooms. Not sure how to boost you immune system with beta glucans?

Get exercise Exercise is another wonderful way to support your immune system. A 2017 [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159116305645) revealed that the body needs only 20 minutes of exercise before the immune system starts to reap the rewards. And the even better news? There are dozens of ways to incorporate more exercise into your life. Not sure how to boost you immune system with exercise? Try: 13. Get plenty of rest Because lack of sleep can compromise your immune system, it's important to prioritize your sleep. Between the [sleep struggles of pregnancy](https://mamanatural.com/sleep-safely-when-pregnant/) and the chaos of raising a family, getting enough sleep isn't always easy. Try: - Resisting the temptation to binge-watch shows late at night - Putting down your cell phone after dark to decrease [blue light exposure](https://mamanatural.com/blue-light-blocking-glasses/) - Setting a \"bedtime\" reminder on your phone - Creating your own relaxing bedtime routine with herbal tea or a lavender-essence bedtime bath But how much sleep do you really need? According to the American Sleep Foundation, adults need at least seven to nine hours. ( [source](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sites/default/files/STREPchanges_1.png)) Supercharge Your Immune System While the above are great daily habits to boost your immune system, the following remedies aren't intended to be used daily, because the are immune stimulants. They're better suited for when you feel a cold coming on, or are entering cold and flu season. What's an immune stimulant? Immune stimulants are substances (both chemical and natural) that stimulate, or encourage, the immune system to react. Instead of strengthening the immune system over time, immune stimulants signal the immune system to act. So when immune stimulants\u2014like elderberry or astragalus root\u2014are taken regularly, they can actually overstimulate your immune system. Though they are effective remedies, save the below for when you feel like your immune system needs an immediate boost. 1. Try elderberry Elderberry syrup is extremely popular in naturally-minded community. Many mamas find that elderberry helps to support the immune system during times when extra support is needed, like when one member of your family is already sick. The studies support the anecdotal stories, too. In fact, even when up against the flu, elderberry syrup shortens the duration of the illness. ( [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15080016)) While you can make your own syrup, you can also find elderberry in pre-made formulas, which is perfect if you don't have a lot of extra time. Try: Tip: Many elderberry recipes contain honey, so avoid giving those to babies under one year. 2. Take astragalus root Astragalus root is the dried root of the astragalus plant. Being native to China, this root has been used in Chinese medicine for hundreds of years. And studies support this: One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3484152/) found that astragalus root enhances the body's immune response, may even help prevent viral infections. Not sure how to boost you immune system with astragalus root? Make a tincture with the dried root or take it in [capsule form](https://www.amazon.com/Gaia-Herbs-Astragalus-Supreme-Capsules/dp/B00F1J733W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1538140745&sr=1-7&keywords=astralagus+root&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=40cf4d1db9d705483efef4d243ad624e&language=en_US). 3. Take echinacea You've probably seen echinacea in garden stores. It grows as a beautiful purple flower. But this little flower packs a powerful punch, and is great if you need to kick your immune system into gear. In fact, a 2017 [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28627238) showed that Echinacea purpurea was effective in helping the body fight against the flu virus. While you could dry some echinacea flowers and make your own tea, you can save yourself the trouble and purchase a [tea blend](https://www.amazon.com/Yogi-Herbal-Echinacea-Immune-Support/dp/B000M7NH8I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1537907717&sr=1-5&keywords=tea+blend+with+echinacea&linkCode=ll1&tag=mamanatural-20&linkId=0e0a1382e20ac81075f651c8e3c9ad73&language=en_US) that already contains echinacea. 4. Try homeopathic remedies If you're starting to feel the onset of a cold, or trying to prevent yourself from catching whatever everyone else in the family already has, there are some homeopathic remedies that can help stimulate your immune system. Though the following may help, it's important to talk to your healthcare provider about what's best for you\u2014specific remedies depend on your symptoms. - [Oscillococcinum](https://www.amazon.com/Boiron-Oscillococcinum-Flu-like-Symptoms-Pellets/dp/B0078W0QOI): Though studies are limited, there is [evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10796675) that this homeopathic remedy reduces the duration of influenza, as well as symptoms like fatigue, headache, body aches, chills, and [fever](https://mamanatural.com/baby-fever/). - [Cold calm](https://www.amazon.com/Boiron-Coldcalm-Relief-Dissolving-Tablets-60/dp/B00014D1K6): This homeopathic remedy is said to relieve symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, nasal congestion, and minor sore throat. - Other homeopathic remedies include: Aconite (influenza/cold and congestion), Arsenicum (digestive issues), Baptisia (influenza, common cold, and sore throat), Belladonna (cough, cold, and fever), Bryonia (stomach and intestinal discomfort), Eupatorium-perfoliatum (influenza, fever, cough, diarrhea), Gelsemium (influenza, colds, fever, diarrhea), Nux-vomica (digestive issues, headache), Rhus-toxicodendron (influenza, digestive issues, fever).
