This exhaustive list names many different adaptogens, including Ashwagandha, Ginseng, & Reishi", "sitename": "The Botanical Institute", "date": "2021-12-15", "cleaned_text": "An adaptogen is a natural herb that helps the body fight stress, supports normal metabolic function, and restores systemic equilibrium. In this article, we've compiled an exhaustive list of adaptogens based on the scientific definition of adaptogens. Not all adaptogens are created equal, in fact, there are many different categories of adaptogens. Some are [good for sleep](https://botanicalinstitute.org/adaptogens-for-sleep/) and relaxation, others are [energizing](https://botanicalinstitute.org/adaptogens-for-energy-and-focus/) and mentally stimulating. Table of Contents How Adaptogens Work: There are many adaptogens and each adaptogen has a specific physiological function in which they work. In general, adaptogens work by helping the body to adapt to external stress and normalize bodily function. [Extensive research](https://doi.org/10.1111/nyas.13399) has been done on adaptogens showing adaptogens' capability in supportive (hepatic, adrenal, renal, and cardiovascular) functions as well as general health-supporting effects. You can learn more about the specifics of [how adaptogens work](https://botanicalinstitute.org/adaptogens/) here. Primary vs. Secondary Adaptogens: Primary adaptogens are the main herbs that you think of when you think of the word \"adaptogen\". This includes popular herbs like [Ashwagandha](https://botanicalinstitute.org/ashwagandha/), [Ginseng](https://botanicalinstitute.org/asian-ginseng/), [Rhodiola](https://botanicalinstitute.org/rhodiola/), etc... In general, primary adaptogens have been proven through a long history of traditional use as well as rigorous scientific study. Primary adaptogens also meet the primary criteria of being an adaptogen, which include: - They Produce a Nonspecific Defense Response to Stress - They Have a Normalizing Influence on the Body - They are Non-Toxic - They Help Re-Regulate Endocrine, Nervous System, Immune, Digestive, and Cardiovascular Function Secondary adaptogens are herbs that either fulfill only 2-3 of these guidelines or are herbs that have not been studied enough to be moved into the \"primary adaptogen\" camp. Read on to see our full adaptogen Among adaptogens, there is much variety. Some grow in extreme heat while some grow in extreme cold. Some adaptogenic plants grow at sea level, others only grow on mountain tops. This diversity is part of the reason why adaptogens are adaptable to many different people. The plants themselves tend to be very resilient, and it's said that they pass on that resilience to the people that consume them. Conclusion: Adaptogens show great potential in reducing adaptational damage by functioning as protective agents for human cells and are generally nontoxic when consumed at recommended doses. We hope this list of adaptogens has been helpful. Do you have any plants that you'd consider adding to our adaptogen list? Gerontakos, S. E., Casteleijn, D., Shikov, A. N., & Wardle, J. (2020).
