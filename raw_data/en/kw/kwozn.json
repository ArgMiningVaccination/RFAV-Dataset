Jk... that's the flu shot.\" Some flu vaccines used both in the US and UK do contain trace amounts of formaldehyde but not enough to do any harm. Some also contain small amounts of polysorbate 80, which is safe unless someone has an allergy to the chemical. Misleading information about these chemicals, and others, being present in vaccines is a common occurence online and we have written about such claims [multiple](/online/vaccine-ingredients/) [times](/health/flu-shot-ingredients/) [before](/online/vaccines-cancer-studies/).

It's [found naturally](https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-ingredients#Formaldehyde) in lots of living things, including [humans and fruit](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/formaldehyde-properties-incident-management-and-toxicology/formaldehyde-general-information). The amount of natural formaldehyde found in a two-month-old infant's blood is ten times the amount found in any vaccine. Also, it breaks down quickly in water, and most of a vaccine is water. Formaldehyde is a naturally-occurring chemical commonly used as a [raw material](https://www.bwf.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/factsheet-on-formaldehyde.pdf) to make other chemicals for industry, especially in creating glues for engineered wood products like MDF and plywood, as well as household cleaners, paints, pesticides and medicinal and personal care products. Formaldehyde [can be dangerous](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/formaldehyde-properties-incident-management-and-toxicology/formaldehyde-general-information#:~:text=Formaldehyde%20has%20been%20classified%20as,periods%20of%20time%20(years).) in much larger amounts than are found in vaccines, which usually only happens to those working in industries where they are exposed to large amounts of it over a period of years. In the US, there are [several different](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/flushot.htm) flu vaccines available for the [2022/23 season](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/acip/2022-2023/acip-table.htm). Formaldehyde is also used in the production of some of [these flu vaccines](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients/formaldehyde#:~:text=Boostrix%3A%20%E2%89%A4%200.1%20mg-,Influenza,-Not%20all%20influenza). [Certain flu vaccines](https://www.wmic.wales.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/PGD_influenza_-v1.1_nohyperlinks_August2022.pdf#page=17) used in the UK may also contain [traces of formaldehyde](https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/inactivated-flu-vaccine). [Other vaccines](https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-ingredients#Formaldehyde), like and the [6-in-1 vaccine](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/6-in-1-infant-vaccine/) may also contain trace amounts. Formaldehyde is used in the [manufacturing process](https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-ingredients#Formaldehyde) of these vaccines to kill the virus or [inactivate toxins](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/additives.htm). Polysorbate 80 Polysorbate 80 is a chemical [used in food](https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/vaccine-ingredients#Emulsifiers), [cosmetics](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5118432/) and medicines as an emulsifier, which holds different ingredients together. It is an ingredient in [some flu vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/b/excipient-table-2.pdf#page=3) used in the US [and the UK](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1105068/Flu-information-for-HCPs-2022-to-2023-20Sept22.pdf#page=19), as well as several other vaccines, including the [AstraZeneca Covid-19](https://www.sefton.gov.uk/media/4523/vaccination-faq-v03-web-version.pdf#page=18) vaccine and [HPV](https://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/19033#gref) vaccine. People can be [allergic to polysorbate 80](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16400901/), and have allergic reactions to it or [similar chemicals](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1102459/Greenbook-chapter-14a-4September22.pdf#page=42). However, this is [very rare](https://www.sefton.gov.uk/media/4523/vaccination-faq-v03-web-version.pdf#page=16). Polysorbate used [for decades](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1169&context=foodmicrostructure&httpsredir=1&referer=) to [make ice cream](https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-ingredients) melt slower and give a smooth texture. Ice cream contains far more polysorbate 80 than vaccines do. Image "}
