Here are a few reasons to dump your current products and see an ND about the right supplements for you. 1. Absorption Vitamins and minerals come in many different forms, some of which are more readily absorbed in the digestive tract than others. High quality supplements will use the most bioavailable, active form of the vitamin to ensure that your body can absorb and use it appropriately. \"High quality supplements go through rigorous quality control...\" (Dr. Godby Note: for example, go check your vitamins..if it says \"folic acid,\" this is the non-activated folate that more than 30% of the American population can't use and could actually be harming you). 2. Label Matching Contents A recent [study] looked at claimed doses on the label of [vitamin supplements], compared with the actual dose in each pill, and found an overwhelming discrepancy with potency varying from 9% - 140%. High quality supplements go through rigorous quality control to ensure that each and every [tablet], capsule, or spoonful delivers exactly what the label says. \"Buying a good supplement will save you money...\" 3. Correct Dose Buying a good supplement with a high dose will mean you only need to take 1 or 2, and SAVE you money. 4. Fillers and Toxins Average supplements often have many fillers which people may be allergic or sensitive to. These fillers may also hinder the absorption of other ingredients in the formula.Many supplements may also contain toxins like mercury and lead. [Professional supplements] will ensure no contamination, and no toxins. 5. Backed by Research High quality supplements have research to support their benefit in two different ways. A good company will critically analyze a wide variety of research and include appropriate doses and forms of well-researched ingredients in their formulas. A great company will conduct their own research on their formulas to ensure that the product yields the expected benefit. "}
