Introduction The Internal Revenue Bulletin is the authoritative instrument ofthe Commissioner of Internal Revenue for announcing ofcialrulings and procedures of the Internal Revenue Service and forpublishing Treasury Decisions, Executive Orders, Tax Conven-tions, legislation, court decisions, and other items of generalinterest. It is published weekly. It is the policy of the Service to publish in the Bulletin all substantive rulings necessary to promote a uniform applicationof the tax laws, including all rulings that supersede, revoke,modify, or amend any of those previously published in theBulletin. All published rulings apply retroactively unless other-wise indicated. Procedures relating solely to matters of internalmanagement are not published; however, statements of inter-nal practices and procedures that affect the rights and dutiesof taxpayers are published. Revenue rulings represent the conclusions of the Service on the application of the law to the pivotal facts stated in therevenue ruling. In those based on positions taken in rulings totaxpayers or technical advice to Service eld ofces, identify-ing details and information of a condential nature are deletedto prevent unwarranted invasions of privacy and to comply withstatutory requirements. Rulings and procedures reported in the Bulletin do not have the force and effect of Treasury Department Regulations, but theymay be used as precedents. Unpublished rulings will not berelied on, used, or cited as precedents by Service personnel inthe disposition of other cases. In applying published rulings andprocedures, the effect of subsequent legislation, regulations,court decisions, rulings, and procedures must be considered,and Service personnel and others concerned are cautionedagainst reaching the same conclusions in other cases unless the facts and circumstances are substantially the same. The Bulletin is divided into four parts as follows:Part I.\u20141986 Code. This part includes rulings and decisions based on provisions ofthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Part II.\u2014Treaties and Tax Legislation. This part is divided into two subparts as follows: Subpart A, TaxConventions and Other Related Items, and Subpart B, Legisla-tion and Related Committee Reports. Part III.\u2014Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous. To the extent practicable, pertinent cross references to thesesubjects are contained in the other Parts and Subparts. Alsoincluded in this part are Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rul-ings. Bank Secrecy Act Administrative Rulings are issued bythe Department of the Treasury's Ofce of the Assistant Sec-retary (Enforcement). Part IV.\u2014Items of General Interest. This part includes notices of proposed rulemakings, disbar-ment and suspension lists, and announcements. The last Bulletin for each month includes a cumulative index for the matters published during the preceding months. Thesemonthly indexes are cumulated on a semiannual basis, and arepublished in the last Bulletin of each semiannual period.

Rulings and Decisions Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \u00a7 1.432(e)(9)-1T: Benet suspensions for multiemployer plans in critical and declining status (temporary). T.D. 9723 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURYInternal Revenue Service26 CFR Parts 1 and 602 Suspension of Benets under the Multiemployer Pension ReformAct of 2014 AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Temporary regulations.SUMMARY: This document contains temporary regulations relating to mul-tiemployer pension plans that are pro-jected to have insufcient funds, at somepoint in the future, to pay the full benetsto which individuals will be entitled underthe plans (referred to as plans in \"criticaland declining status\"). The Multiem-ployer Pension Reform Act of 2014(\"MPRA\") amended the Internal RevenueCode to incorporate suspension of benetsprovisions that permit these multiem-ployer plans to reduce pension benetspayable to participants and beneciaries ifcertain conditions are satised. MPRA re-quires the Secretary of the Treasury, inconsultation with the Pension BenetGuaranty Corporation and the Secretaryof Labor, to approve or deny applicationsby these plans to reduce benets. As re-quired by MPRA, these temporary regu-lations, together with proposed regula-tions being published at the same time,provide guidance implementing these stat-utory provisions. These temporary regula-tions affect active, retired, and deferredvested participants and beneciaries ofmultiemployer plans that are in criticaland declining status as well as employerscontributing to, and sponsors and admin-istrators of, those plans. The text of thesetemporary regulations also serves, in part,as the text of the proposed regulations (REG-102648-15) set forth in the noticeof proposed rulemaking on this subject inthe Proposed Rules section of this issue oftheFederal Register . DATES: Effective Date : These regula- tions are effective on June 19, 2015. Applicability Date : For date of appli- cability, see \u00a7 1.432(e)(9)-1T(j). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: The the Trea- sury MPRA guidance at(202) 622-1559 (not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act These temporary regulations are being issued without prior notice and public pro-cedure pursuant to the AdministrativeProcedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553). For thisreason, the collection of information con-tained in these regulations has been re-viewed and, pending receipt and evalua-tion of public comments, approved by theOfce of Management and Budget undercontrol number 1545-2260. An agency may not conduct or spon- sor, and a person is not required to re-spond to, a collection of information un-less the collection of information displaysa valid control number. For further information concerning this collection of information, and where tosubmit comments on the collection of in-formation and the accuracy of the esti-mated burden, and suggestions for reduc-ing this burden, please refer to thepreamble to the cross-referenced notice ofproposed rulemaking on this subject in theProposed Rules section in this issue of theFederal Register . Books or records relating to a collec- tion of information must be retained aslong as their contents may become mate-rial in the administration of any internalrevenue law. Generally, tax returns andtax return information are condential, asrequired by 26 Section 432(e)(9) 1of Internal Rev- enue Code (Code) permits the plan spon-sor of a multiemployer plan that is pro-jected to have insufcient funds, at somepoint in the future, to pay the full benetsto which individuals will be entitled underthe plan (referred to as a plan in \"criticaland declining status\") to reduce the pen-sion benets payable to participants andbeneciaries under the plan if certain con-ditions are satised (referred to as a \"sus-pension of benets\"). MPRA requires theSecretary of the Treasury, in consultationwith the Pension Benet Guaranty Corpo-ration and the Secretary of Labor (gener-ally referred to in this preamble as theTreasury Department, PBGC, and LaborDepartment, respectively), to issue appro-priate guidance to implement the provi-sions of section 432(e)(9). This documentcontains temporary regulations under sec-tion 432(e)(9) that, together with proposedregulations that are being published else-where in this issue of the Federal Regis- terand a revenue procedure being pub- lished in the Internal Revenue Bulletin,Rev. Proc. 2015-34, implement section432(e)(9) as required by the statute. TheTreasury Department consulted with thePBGC and the Labor Department on thesetemporary regulations. The temporary regulations in this doc- ument, which are applicable immediately,provide sufcient guidance to enable aplan sponsor that wishes to apply for ap-proval of a suspension of benets to pre-pare and submit such an application, andto enable the Department of the Treasuryto begin the processing of such an appli-cation. The temporary regulations providegeneral guidance regarding section432(e)(9), including guidance regardingthe meaning of the term \"suspension ofbenets,\" the general conditions for a sus-pension of benets, and the implementa-tion of a suspension after a participant 1Section 432(e)(9) was added to the Internal Revenue Code by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-280 (120 Stat. 780 (2006)) (PPA '06) and a mended by the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, Division O of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, Public Law No. 113-235 (128 Stat. 2130 (20 14)) (MPRA). August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 84vote. The notice of proposed rulemaking, published elsewhere in this issue of theFederal Register , includes the proposed regulations and requests comments on theprovisions of the proposed regulations aswell as these temporary regulations. Theprovisions of the temporary regulationsand proposed regulations are expected tobe integrated and issued as a single set ofnal regulations with any changes that aremade following consideration of the com-ments. The proposed regulations, which are not applicable immediately, contain addi-tional provisions with respect to which theDepartment of the Treasury intends toconsider public comments before naliz-ing a decision to approve an applicationfor suspension of benets. The proposedregulations also provide additional guid-ance regarding section 432(e)(9), includ-ing guidance relating to the standards thatwill be applied in reviewing an applica-tion for suspension of benets and thestatutory limitations on a suspension of benets. The regulations implementing the stat- utory suspension of benets provisionshave been divided, as described, into tem-porary regulations and proposed regula-tions in order to balance the interest inconsidering public comments on rules be-fore they apply with the evident statutoryintent, reflected in MPRA, to implementthe statutory provisions without undue de-lay. Although the Department of the Trea-sury is issuing proposed and temporaryregulations under section 432(e)(9), it isexpected that no application proposing abenet suspension will be approved priorto the issuance of nal regulations. If aplan sponsor chooses to submit an appli-cation for approval of a proposed benetsuspension in accordance with the pro-posed and temporary regulations beforethe issuance of nal regulations, then theplan sponsor may need to revise the pro-posed suspension (and potentially the re-lated notices to plan participants) or sup-plement the application to take intoaccount any differences in the require-ments relating to suspensions of benetsthat might be included in the nal regula-tions.Rev. Proc. 2015-34 prescribes the spe- cics of the application process for ap-proval of a proposed benet suspension.The revenue procedure also provides amodel notice that a plan sponsor propos-ing a benet suspension may use to satisfythe statutory notice requirement. Statutory Background Code section 412 contains minimum funding rules that generally apply to pen-sion plans. Code section 431, added bysection 211 of PPA '06, sets that apply specically tomultiemployer dened plans.Code section 432, added by section 212 ofPPA '06, sets forth additional rules thatapply to certain multiemployer plans inendangered or critical status, and permitsplans in critical status to be amended toreduce certain otherwise protected benets(referred to as adjustable benets). Section202 of PPA '06 amended section 305 of theEmployee Retirement Income Security Actof 1974, Public Law 93-406 (88 Stat. 829(1974)), as amended (ERISA), to prescribeparallel rules. PPA '06 provided that Codesection 432 and ERISA section 305 wouldsunset for plan years beginning after De-cember 31, 2014. However, section 101 ofMPRA made them permanent, with certainmodications. Section 201 of MPRA amended Code section 432 to add a new status, calledcritical and declining status, for multiem-ployer dened benet plans. Section432(b)(6) provides that a plan in criticalstatus is treated as being in critical anddeclining status if the plan satises thecriteria for critical status and in addition isprojected to become insolvent within themeaning of section 418E during the cur- rent plan year or any of the 14 succeed- ing plan years (or 19 succeeding planyears if the plan has a ratio of inactiveparticipants to active participants thatexceeds two to one or if the fundedpercentage of the plan is less than 80percent). Section 201 of MPRA alsoamended Code section 432(e)(9) to pre-scribe benet suspension rules for plansin critical and declining status. 2MPRA was enacted on December 16, 2014. Section 201(b)(7) of MPRA pro-vides that, not later than 180 days after thedate of enactment, the Treasury Depart-ment, in consultation with the PBGC andthe Labor Department, is required to pub-lish appropriate guidance to implementsection 432(e)(9). Section 201(c) ofMPRA provides that the amendmentsmade by section 201 will take effect onthe date of enactment. On February 18, 2015, the Department of the Treasury issued a Request for In-formation on Suspensions of Benets un-der the Multiemployer Pension ReformAct of 2014 in the Federal Register (80 FR 8578). The Request for Informationincluded questions focusing on certainmatters to be addressed in guidance im-plementing section 432(e)(9) and indi-cated that multiemployer plans should notsubmit applications for suspensions ofbenets prior to a date specied in suchfuture guidance. These temporary regula-tions, and the proposed regulations pub-lished elsewhere in this issue of the Fed- eral Register , reflect consideration of comments received in response to the Re-quest for Information. Denition of suspension of benets and general rules under section 432(e)(9)(A)and 432(e)(9)(B)(i) through (iv) Section 201 of MPRA prescribes ben- et suspension rules for multiemployerdened benet plans in critical and declin-ing status. Section 432(e)(9)(A) providesthat notwithstanding section 411(d)(6)and subject to section 432(e)(9)(B)through (I), the plan sponsor of a plan incritical and declining status may, by planamendment, suspend benets that thesponsor deems appropriate. The statute denes suspension of ben- ets as the temporary or permanent reduc-tion of any current or future payment ob-ligation of the plan to any participant orbeneciary under the plan, whether or notin pay status at the time of the suspensionof benets. Any suspension will remain in effect until the earlier of when the plansponsor provides benet improvements inaccordance with section 432(e)(9)(E) or 2Section 201 of MPRA makes parallel amendments to section 305 of ERISA and the Department of the Treasury has interpretive jurisdiction over the subjec t matter of these provisions under ERISA as well as the Code. See also section 101 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713). Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 85when the suspension expires by its own terms. Thus, if a suspension does notexpire by its own terms, it continuesindenitely. Under the statute, a plan will not be liable for any benet payments not madeas a result of a suspension of benets.All references to suspensions of bene-ts, increases in benets, or resumptionsof suspended benets with respect toparticipants will with respectto benets of beneciaries or alternativepayees 3of participants. See section 432(e)(9)(B)(iv). Retiree representative In the case of a plan with 10,000 or more participants, section 432(e)(9)(B)(v)requires the plan sponsor to select a planparticipant in pay status to act as a retireerepresentative. The retiree representativeis required to advocate for the interests ofthe retired and deferred vested partici-pants and beneciaries of the planthroughout the suspension approval pro-cess. The plan must provide for the retireerepresentative's reasonable expenses, in-cluding reasonable legal and actuarialsupport, commensurate with the plan'ssize and funded status. Conditions for suspensions Section 432(e)(9)(C) sets forth condi- tions that must be satised before a plansponsor of a plan in critical and decliningstatus for a plan year may suspend bene-ts. Under one of the conditions, the planactuary must certify, taking into accountthe proposed suspension of benets (and,if applicable, a proposed partition of theplan under section 4233 of ERISA (parti-tion)), that the plan is projected to avoidinsolvency within the meaning of section418E, assuming the suspension of benetscontinues until it expires by its own termsor if no such expiration date is set, indef- initely. Another condition requires a plan sponsor to determine, in a written recordto be maintained throughout the period ofthe benet suspension, that although allreasonable measures to avoid insolvencyhave been taken (and continue to be takenduring the period of the benet suspen-sion), the plan is still projected to becomeinsolvent unless benets are suspended. Inmaking this determination, the plan spon-sor may take into account factors includ-ing a specied list of 10 statutory factors. 4 See section 432(e)(9)(C)(ii). Limitations on suspensions Section 432(e)(9)(D) contains limita- tions on the benets that may be sus-pended, some of which apply to plan par-ticipants and beneciaries on anindividual basis and some of which applyon an aggregate basis. Under the statute,an individual's monthly benet may notbe reduced below 110 percent of themonthly benet that is guaranteed by thePBGC under section 4022A of ERISA onthe date of the suspension. In addition, nobenets based on disability (as denedunder the plan) may be suspended. In the case of a participant or bene- ciary who has attained age 75 as of theeffective date of a suspension, section432(e)(9)(D)(ii) provides that the suspen-sion may not exceed the applicable percent-age of the suspend-able of individual's benet thatwould be suspended without regard to theage-based limitation. The applicable per-centage is a percentage that is calculated bydividing (i) the number of months duringthe period that begins with the month afterthe month in which the suspension is effec-tive and ends with the month in which thatparticipant or beneciary attains the age of 80 by (ii) 60 months. Section 432(e)(9)(D) also requires the aggregate benet suspensions (consid-ered, if applicable, in connection with apartition) to be reasonably estimated toachieve, but not materially exceed, thelevel that is needed to avoid insolvency. Under the statute, any suspension of benets must be equitably distributedacross the participant and beneciary pop-ulation, taking into account factors thatmay include one or more of a list of 11statutory factors. 5Finally, with regard to a suspension of benets that is made incombination with a partition, section432(e)(9)(D)(v) provides that the suspen-sion may not occur before the effectivedate of the partition. Benet improvements Section 432(e)(9)(E) sets forth rules relating to benet improvements madewhile a suspension of benets is in effect.Under this provision, a benet improve-ment is dened as a resumption of sus-pended benets, an increase in benets, anincrease in the rate at which benets ac-crue, or an increase in the rate at whichbenets become nonforfeitable under theplan. The statute also provides that, while a suspension of benets is in effect, a plansponsor generally has discretion to pro-vide benet improvements. However, asponsor may not increase plan liabilitiesby reason of any benet improvement forany participant or beneciary who is notin pay status (in other words, those whoare not yet receiving benets, such as ac-tive employees or deferred vested em-ployees) unless (1) this benet improve-ment is accompanied by an equitabledistribution of benet improvements forthose who have begun to receive benets(typically, retirees), and (2) the plan actu-ary certies that, after taking those benet 3The Department of the Treasury and the IRS understand this provision to refer to alternate payees. 4These 10 factors are current and past contribution levels; levels of benet accruals (including prior reductions in the rate of benet accruals); pri or adjustable benet reductions and suspensions of benets; the impact on plan solvency of the subsidies and ancillary benets available to active participants; compensation levels of active participants relative to employees in the participants' industry generally; competitive and other economic factors facing contributing employers; the impact of benet and contribut ion levels on retaining active participants and bargaining groups under the plan; the impact of past and anticipated contribution increases under the plan on employer attrition and retention le vels; and measures undertaken by the plan sponsor to retain or attract contributing employers. 5These 11 factors are age and life expectancy; length of time in pay status; amount of benet; type of benet; extent of a subsidized benet; extent of pos t-retirement benet increases; history of benet increases and reductions; years to retirement for active employees; any discrepancies between active and retiree benets; extent to which participants are reasonably likely to withdraw support for the plan, resulting in accelerated employer withdrawal; and the extent to which the benets are attributed to service with an emp loyer that failed to pay its withdrawal liability. August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 86improvements into account, the plan is projected to avoid insolvency inde-nitely. 6Whether an individual is in pay status for this purpose is generally basedon whether the individual's benets be-gan before the rst day of the plan yearfor which the benet improvement tookeffect. Notice of proposed suspension A plan sponsor may not suspend ben- ets unless notice is provided in accor-dance with section 432(e)(9)(F). Underthis section, concurrently with an applica-tion to suspend benets under section432(e)(9)(G), the plan sponsor must givenotice to plan participants and benecia-ries who may be contacted by reasonableefforts, each employer that has an obliga-tion to contribute (within the meaning ofsection 4212(a) of ERISA) under the plan,and each employee organization that rep-resents plan participants employed bythose employers for purposes of collectivebargaining. The notice must contain suf-cient information to enable individualsto understand the effect of any suspensionof benets, including an individualized es-timate, on an annual or monthly basis, ofthe effect on each participant or bene-ciary. The notice must also contain certainother specied information. 7Notice must be provided in a form and manner pre-scribed in agency guidance, written in amanner so as to be understood by theaverage plan participant, and provided inwritten, electronic, or other appropriateform to the extent it is reasonably acces-sible to those to whom notice must befurnished. Any notice provided under section 432(e)(9)(F)(i) will satisfy the require-ment for notice of a signicant reductionin benets described in section 4980F. Seesection 432(e)(9)(F)(iv).Suspension applications Section 432(e)(9)(G) describes the pro- cess for approval or rejection of a plansponsor's application for a suspension ofbenets. Under the statute, the TreasuryDepartment, in consultation with thePBGC and the Labor Department, mustapprove an application upon nding thatthe plan is eligible for the suspensions andhas satised the criteria of sections432(e)(9)(C), (D), (E), and (F) (each de-scribed earlier). In evaluating whether aplan sponsor has met the criteria in section432(e)(9)(C)(ii) (a plan sponsor's deter-mination that, although all reasonablemeasures have been taken, the plan willbecome insolvent if benets are not sus-pended), the plan sponsor's considerationof factors under that clause must be re-viewed. The statute also requires that theplan sponsor's determinations in an appli-cation for a suspension of benets be ac-cepted unless they are clearly erroneous. Section 432(e)(9)(G) also requires an application for a suspension of benets tobe published on the web site of the De-partment of the Treasury and requires theTreasury Department to publish a Federal Register notice within 30 days of receiv- ing a suspension application, solicitingcomments from contributing employers,employee organizations, and participantsand beneciaries of the plan for which asuspension application was made, as wellas other interested parties. Within 225 days after an application for a suspension of benets is submitted,the statute requires the Treasury Depart-ment, in consultation with the PBGC andthe Labor Department, to approve or denythe application. If the plan sponsor is notnotied that it has failed to satisfy one ormore applicable criteria within that 225-day period, the application is deemed ap-proved. If the application is denied, a no-tice to the plan sponsor must detail the specic reasons for the rejection, includ-ing reference to the specic requirementnot satised. Approval or denial of anapplication is treated as nal agency ac-tion for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 704 (that is,the approval or denial is treated as nalagency action for purposes of the Admin-istrative Procedure Act, Public Law 79-404, 60 Stat. 237, as amended (APA)). Participant vote on proposed benet reduction If a suspension application is approved, it then goes to a vote of plan participantsand beneciaries. See section432(e)(9)(H). The vote will be adminis-tered by the Treasury Department, in con-sultation with the PBGC and the LaborDepartment, within 30 days after approvalof the suspension application. The plansponsor is required to provide a ballot fora vote (subject to approval by the Trea-sury Department, in consultation with thePBGC and the Labor Department). Thestatute species information that the ballot must include. 8If a majority of plan par- ticipants and beneciaries do not vote toreject the suspension, the statute requiresthe Treasury Department to issue a nalauthorization to suspend benets withinseven days after the vote. If a majority of plan participants and beneciaries vote to reject the suspension,the statute requires the Treasury Depart-ment, in consultation with the PBGC andthe Labor Department, to determinewhether the plan is a systemically impor-tant plan. A systemically important plan isa plan for which the PBGC projects thepresent value of projected nancial assis-tance payments to exceed $1.0 billion, asindexed, if suspensions are not imple-mented. 6Avoidance of insolvency is determined by reference to section 418E under which a plan is insolvent if it is unable to pay scheduled benets for a year. Pu rsuant to section 432(e)(9)(E)(iv), this restriction does not apply to certain benet improvements if the Treasury Department determines either that the benet improvements are reason able and provide for only de minimis increases in plan liabilities or that the benet improvements are required as a condition of qualication or to comply with other applicable law. 7The specied information includes a description of the factors considered by the plan sponsor in designing the benet suspension; a statement that th e application for suspension of benets will be available on the web site of the Department of the Treasury and that comments on the application will be accepted; information on the rights and r emedies of plan participants and beneciaries; if applicable, a statement about the appointment of a retiree representative, the date of appointment of the retiree representative, identifying information about the retiree representative (including whether the representative is a plan trustee) and how to contact the representative; and information on how to contact the Department of the Treasury for more information and assistance where appropriate. 8This information includes a statement from the plan sponsor in support of the suspension; a statement in opposition to the suspension compiled from co mments received in response to theFederal Register notice issued by Treasury within 30 days of receiving the suspension application; a statement that the suspension has been approved by the Secretary o f the Treasury, in consultation with the PBGC and the Secretary of Labor; a statement that the plan sponsor has determined that the plan will become insolvent unless th e suspension takes effect; a statement that insolvency of the plan could result in benets lower than benets paid under the suspension; and a statement that insolvency of the PBGC would resu lt in benets lower than benets otherwise paid in the case of plan insolvency. Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 87If a majority of plan participants and beneciaries vote to reject the suspensionand the plan is not a systemically impor-tant plan, a nal authorization to suspendbenets will not be issued. In such a case,the statute provides that the plan sponsormay submit a new application for ap-proval of a suspension of benets to theTreasury Department. Within 30 days after a plan is deter- mined to be a systemically important plan,the Participant and Plan Sponsor Advo-cate selected under ERISA may submitrecommendations to the Treasury Depart-ment with respect to the suspension thatwas rejected by the vote or recommenda-tions for any revisions to that suspension.Notwithstanding the vote rejecting thesuspension, the statute requires the Trea-sury Department, in consultation with thePBGC and the Labor Department, to per-mit the plan sponsor to implement eitherthe proposed benet suspension or a mod-ication by the Treasury Department, inconsultation with the PBGC and the LaborDepartment, of that suspension. The Trea-sury Department must complete this re-quirement within 90 days after the resultsof a vote rejecting a suspension for asystemically important plan are certied,and a modication of the suspension bythe Treasury Department is only permittedif the plan is still projected to avoid insol-vency under the modication. If the Treasury Department is required to permit the suspension or a modiedsuspension to go into effect in the case ofa systemically important plan with respectto which there has been a vote rejectingthe suspension, the statute requires theTreasury Department to issue the nal au-thorization to suspend at a time sufcientto allow the suspension to be implementedby the end of the 90-day period followingcertication of the results of that vote. Judicial Review Section 432(e)(9)(I)(i) allows a plan sponsor to challenge a denial of an appli-cation for suspension only after the appli-cation is denied. Under the statute, anaction challenging the approval of a sus-pension may be brought only followingthe issuance of a nal authorization tosuspend. The statute also provides that acourt will review an action challengingapproval of a suspension of benets in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 706 (that is, thestandard of review applicable for purposesof the APA) and will not grant a tempo-rary injunction with respect to a suspen-sion unless it nds a clear and convincinglikelihood that the plaintiff will prevail onthe merits. Under section 432(e)(9)(I)(iii),participants and beneciaries affected bya suspension \"shall not have a cause ofaction under this title.\" An action chal-lenging either the approval of a suspen-sion of benets or the denial of an appli-cation for a suspension of benets maynot be brought more than one year afterthe earliest date on which the plaintiffacquired or should have acquired actualknowledge of the existence of the cause ofaction. See section 432(e)(9)(I)(iv). Explanation of Provisions I.Overview These temporary regulations provide guidance on certain requirements undersection 432(e)(9) regarding suspension ofbenets for multiemployer dened benetplans in critical and declining status. Thetemporary regulations do not address cer-tain other requirements that are addressedin the text of the proposed regulations(REG-102648-15) set forth in the noticeof proposed rulemaking on this subject inthe Proposed Rules section of this issue oftheFederal Register . The provisions of these temporary regulations are cross ref-erenced in the proposed regulations sothat comments on these provisions may beincluded with comments on the proposedregulations. In addition to the proposedand temporary regulations, the proceduralrequirements for submitting an applica-tion to suspend benets, as well as amodel notice, are set forth in Rev. Proc.2015-34. II.General rules on suspension of benets These temporary regulations provide that, subject to section 432(e)(9)(B)through (I), the plan sponsor of a multiem-ployer plan that is in critical and decliningstatus within the meaning of section432(b)(6) for a plan year may, by planamendment, implement a suspension ofbenets that the plan sponsor deems ap-propriate. Such a suspension is permitted notwithstanding the generally applicableanti-cutback provisions of section411(d)(6). The plan amendment imple-menting a suspension of benets must beadopted in a plan year in which the plan isin critical and declining status. Under the regulations, once a plan is amended to suspend benets, a plan maypay or continue to pay a reduced level ofbenets pursuant to a suspension only ifthe terms of the plan are consistent withthe requirements of section 432(e)(9) andthe regulations. III.Denitions The temporary regulations include def- initions for the terms pay status and plansponsor. A person is in pay status under amultiemployer plan if, as described in sec-tion 432(j)(6), at any time during the cur-rent plan year, the person is a participant,beneciary, or alternate payee under theplan and is paid an early, late, normal, ordisability retirement benet under the plan(or a death benet under the plan relatedto a retirement benet). The term plan sponsor means the asso- ciation, committee, joint board of trustees,or other similar group of representativesof the parties that establishes or maintainsthe multiemployer plan. However, in thecase of a plan described in section 404(c),or a continuation of such a plan, the termplan sponsor means the association of em-ployers that is the employer settlor of theplan. IV.Denition of suspension of benets and related rules The temporary regulations provide that the term suspension of benets means thetemporary or permanent reduction, pursu-ant to the terms of the plan, of any currentor future payment obligation of the planwith respect to any participant under theplan. A suspension of benets can applywith respect to a participant of the planregardless of whether the participant, ben-eciary, or alternate payee has com-menced receiving benets before the ef-fective date of the suspension of benets.If a plan pays a reduced level of benetspursuant to a suspension of benets thatcomplies with the requirements of section August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 88432(e)(9), then the plan is not liable for any benets not paid as a result of thesuspension. A suspension of benets may be of indenite duration or may expire as of acertain date. Under the regulations, if thesuspension of benets has an expirationdate, that date must be specied in theplan amendment implementing the sus-pension. The temporary regulations provide that a plan sponsor may amend the plan toeliminate some or all of a suspension ofbenets, provided that the amendment sat-ises the requirements that apply to ben-et improvements in the proposed rulesunder section 432(e)(9)(E). The temporary regulations clarify that, except as otherwise specied, all refer-ences to suspensions of benets, increasesin benets, or resumptions of suspendedbenets with respect to participants alsoapply with respect to benets of bene-ciaries or alternate payees (as dened insection 414(p)(8)) of participants. V.Retiree representative A retiree representative must be se- lected for a plan with 10,000 or moreparticipants. The temporary regulationsimplement this condition by requiring thata retiree representative be selected if10,000 or more participants were reportedon the most recently led Form 5500,\"Annual Return/Report of Employee Ben-et Plan.\" 9The plan sponsor must select the retiree representative at least 60 daysbefore the plan sponsor submits an appli-cation to suspend benets. The retiree rep-resentative must be a plan participant whois in pay status and may or may not be aplan trustee. The role of the retiree representative is to advocate for the interests of the retiredand deferred vested participants and ben-eciaries of the plan throughout the sus-pension approval process. However, in thediscretion of the plan sponsor, the retireerepresentative may continue in this rolethroughout the period of the benet sus-pension. This would enable the retireerepresentative to monitor compliance withthe ongoing requirements during the pe- riod of the suspension, such as the require-ment that the plan sponsor make annualdeterminations that all reasonable mea-sures to avoid insolvency have been takenand that a suspension is necessary to avoidinsolvency as well as to monitor compli-ance with the rules relating to benet im-provements. The regulations refer to sec-tion 432(e)(9)(B)(v)(III) for rules relatingto the duciary status of a retiree repre-sentative, but do not provide additionalguidance with respect to this provision. The plan must pay reasonable expenses incurred by the retiree representative, in-cluding reasonable legal and actuarialsupport, commensurate with the plan'ssize and funded status. Upon request, theplan sponsor must promptly provide theretiree representative with relevant infor-mation, such as plan documents and data,that is reasonably necessary to enable theretiree representative to perform the repr-esentative's role, described earlier underthis paragraph V. The temporary regulations permit a plan sponsor of a plan that has reportedfewer than 10,000 participants to select aretiree representative in connection withan application for approval of a suspen-sion of benets in order to encourage sucha plan sponsor to do so. If a retiree repre-sentative is selected for such a plan, therules that apply to retiree representativesfor plans with 10,000 or more participants(other than the rule concerning the size ofthe plan and the timing of the appoint-ment) will apply. VI.Conditions for suspensions A plan sponsor of a plan in critical and declining status 10may suspend benets only if the actuarial certication the certication requirement in sec-tion 432(e)(9)(C)(i) is satised if, takinginto account the proposed suspension of benets (and, if applicable, a proposedpartition of the plan), the plan's actuarycerties that the plan is projected to avoidinsolvency within the meaning of section418E, assuming the suspension of benetscontinues until it expires by its own termsor if no such expiration date is set, indef-initely. The tem porary regulations do not provide guidance on this topic. How-ever, the proposed regulations providerules for the comparable requirementthat the suspension (in combination witha partition, if applicable) be reasonablyestimated to avoid insolvency under sec-tion 432(e)(9)(D)(iv). B.Plan-sponsor determinations A plan may not suspend benets unless the plan sponsor makes initial and annualdeterminations that the plan is projected tobecome insolvent unless benets are sus-pended, although all reasonable measuresto avoid insolvency have been taken andcontinue to be taken. Under the temporary regulations, a plan satises the initial-plan-sponsor de-terminations requirement only if the plansponsor determines that (1) all reasonablemeasures to avoid insolvency, within themeaning of section 418E, have beentaken, and (2) the plan is projected tobecome insolvent within the meaning ofsection 418E unless the proposed suspen-sion of benets (or another suspension ofbenets under section 432(e)(9)) is imple-mented for the plan. In making its determination that all rea- sonable measures to avoid insolvency havebeen taken, the plan sponsor may take intoaccount the non-exclusive list of factors setforth in section 432(e)(9)(C)(ii). In m aking the initial determination that the plan isprojected to become insolvent without theproposed suspension of benets (or an-other suspension under section 432(e)(9)),a plan sponsor may rely on the actuarialcertication made pursuant to section432(b)(3)(A)(i) that the plan is in criticaland declining status for the plan year. 9On the Form 5500 for the 2014 plan year, this is the total number of participants as of the end of the plan year that is reported on Part II, Line 6f. 10In making the projections related to whether a plan is in critical and declining status, the plan actuary's projections are required to be based on reas onable actuarial assumptions. Rev. Proc. 2015-34 requires disclosure of a 10-year history of certain critical assumptions for this purpose as well as for purposes of the conditions for suspen sions required by section 432(e)(9)(C). Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 89The rules relating to the annual-plan- sponsor determinations are included in theproposed regulations. VII. Limitations on suspensions The proposed and temporary regula- tions reflect the individual and aggregatelimitations on a suspension of benets un-der section 432(e)(9)(D). 11The temporary regulations provide that after applying theindividual limitations, the overall size anddistribution of the suspension is subject tothe aggregate limitations. The temporary regulations provide that the monthly benet payable to a partici-pant, beneciary, or alternate payee maynot be reduced below 110 percent of themonthly benet that would be guaranteedby the PBGC under section 4022A ofERISA if the plan were to become insol-vent as of the effective date of the suspen-sion. The proposed regulations providemore detailed rules for applying this lim-itation. The temporary regulations reflect the stat- utory prohibition in section 432(e)(9)(D)(iii)on applying a suspension of benets tobenets based on disability (as denedunder the plan). The proposed regulationsinclude more detailed rules for applyingthis limitation. The rules regarding the age-based lim- itation of section 432(e)(9)(D)(ii) andthe aggregate limitations of section 432(e)(9)(D)(iv) and (vi) are set forth in theproposed regulations. In any case in which a suspension of benets with respect to a plan is made incombination with a partition of the plan,the suspension of benets may not takeeffect prior to the effective date of thepartition. This requirement will not be sat-ised if the partition order under section4233 of ERISA has not been provided to theTreasury Department by the last day of the225-day review period described in section432(e)(9)(G)(iii), after which deemed ap-proval of the suspension would occur. VIII. Benet improvements The rules regarding restrictions on ben- et improvements are set forth in the pro-posed regulations.IX.Notice of proposed suspension The temporary regulations prescribe rules implementing the statutory noticerequirements in section 432(e)(9)(F). Specically, the temporary regulations require the plan sponsor to provide noticeof a proposed suspension to all plan par-ticipants, beneciaries of deceased partic-ipants, and alternate payees (regardless ofwhether their benets are proposed to besuspended) except those who cannot becontacted by reasonable efforts; each em-ployer that has an obligation to contribute(within the meaning of section 4212(a) ofERISA) under the plan; and each em-ployee organization which, for purposesof collective bargaining, represents planparticipants employed by such an em-ployer. The temporary regulations providetwo examples illustrating what effortsconstitute reasonable efforts to contact in-dividuals for purposes of this notice re-quirement. These examples indicate that itis not sufcient to merely send notices tothe individuals' last known mailing ad-dresses and illustrate additional steps thatmay be used to satisfy these requirementsif the plan sponsor becomes aware thatsome individuals did not receive notice. The temporary regulations require the notice to contain the following in order tosatisfy the requirement that the noticecontain sufcient information to enableplan participants and beneciaries to un-derstand the effect of the suspension ofbenets: An individualized estimate, on an an- nual or monthly basis, of the effect ofthe suspension on the participant orbeneciary. However, if it is not pos-sible to provide an individualized esti- mate on an annual or monthly basis ofthe quantitative effect of the suspen-sion on the participant or beneciary,such as in the case of a suspension thataffects the payment of any future cost-of-living adjustment, a narrative de-scription of the effect of the suspen-sion; A statement that the plan sponsor has determined that the plan will becomeinsolvent unless the proposed suspen-sion (and, if applicable, the proposedpartition) takes effect, and the year in which insolvency is projected to occurwithout a suspension of benets (and,if applicable, a proposed partition); A statement that insolvency of the plan could result in benets lower than ben-ets paid under the proposed suspen-sion and a description of the projectedbenet payments upon insolvency; A description of the proposed suspen- sion and its effect, including a descrip-tion of the different categories orgroups affected by the suspension,how those categories or groups are de-ned, and the formula that is used tocalculate the amount of the proposedsuspension for individuals in each cat-egory or group; A description of the effect of the pro- posed suspension on the plan's pro-jected insolvency; A description of whether the suspen- sion will remain in effect indenitelyor will expire by its own terms; and A statement describing the right to vote on the suspension application. The notice of proposed suspension may not include false or misleading infor-mation (or omit information so as to causethe information provided to be mislead-ing). The notice is permitted to includeinformation in addition to the requiredinformation that is listed under this para-graph IX., including information relatingto an application for partition under sec-tion 4233 of ERISA, provided that it sat-ises these requirements. The notice of proposed suspension must be written in a manner that can be readily understood by the average planparticipant. The temporary regulationsprovide that the Treasury Department willprovide a model notice. The use of themodel notice will satisfy the content re-quirement and the readability requirementwith respect to the language provided inthe model. The temporary regulations provide that notice may be provided in writing or inelectronic form to the extent that the elec-tronic form is reasonably accessible topersons to whom the notice is required tobe provided. Permissible electronic meth-ods include those permitted under regula-tions of the Department of Labor at 29 11The temporary regulations refer to section 432(e)(9)(D)(vii) for additional rules applicable to certain plans, but do not provide additional guida nce with respect to this provision. August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 90CFR 2520.104b-1(c) and those described at \u00a7 54.4980F-1, Q&A-13(c) of the Ex-cise Tax Regulations. Section 432(e)(9)(F) provides that the notice of proposed suspension must begiven \"concurrently\" with the submissionof an application to the Treasury Depart-ment, but does not specify a precise time-frame for satisfying this requirement. In-terpreting \"concurrently\" as meaningeither simultaneously or on the same daywas rejected because it would require thedifcult synchronization of the plan spon-sor's electronic submission of its applica-tion and its giving of notice in writtenand/or in electronic form. Because thetemporary regulations require a plan spon-sor to submit its application electronicallybut authorize it to give notice in writing,interpreting the term \"concurrently\" to al-low a plan sponsor to give written notice afew days earlier than the electronic sub-mission of the application will allow forthe receipt of such written notices on orabout the time that a plan sponsor submitsits application. The temporary regulationsthus permit a plan sponsor to give noticeno earlier than four business days beforethe submission of its application. The temporary regulations also antici- pate that a plan sponsor is permitted togive written notice no later than four busi-ness days after the submission of its ap-plication. This period of time will enablethe Department of the Treasury to make apreliminary \"completeness check\" of theapplication during the rst two businessdays, and the plan sponsor two businessdays thereafter to give the required no- tices. 12This approach will help partici- pants by minimizing the risk of confusionand plan expense. For example, if a plansponsor submits an incomplete applica-tion, compiles the additional information,and then nds the individualized estimatesthat the plan sponsor already gave to beinaccurate (or simply takes too long tocompile the additional information), theplan sponsor would have to re-send thenotices, increasing the likelihood that thenotice would not be understood by theaverage plan participant as a result of re-ceiving two different notices, each with adifferent individualized estimate. Al-though the temporary regulations allowplan sponsors to give participants notice when or before the application is submit-ted, sponsors are encouraged to delay giv-ing notice until after the Department ofthe Treasury provides notication that theapplication is complete. If additional indi-viduals who are entitled to notice are lo-cated after the time notice is required to bedelivered, the plan sponsor must givethose newly located individuals notice assoon as practicable after they are located. The temporary regulations further pro- vide that a notice of proposed suspensionsatises the requirement for notice of asignicant reduction in benets describedin section 4980F that would otherwise berequired as a result of that suspension ofbenets. To the extent that other reduc-tions accompany a suspension of benets,such as a reduction in the future accrualrate described in section 4980F for activeparticipants or a reduction in adjustablebenets under section 432(e)(8), noticethat satises the requirements (includingthe requirements) ofsection or section 432(e)(8), as ap-plicable, must be provided. X.Approval or denial of an application for suspension of benets The temporary regulations provide that the plan sponsor of a plan in critical anddeclining status for a plan year that seeksto suspend benets must submit an appli-cation for approval of the proposed sus-pension of benets to the Treasury De-partment. The Treasury Department willapprove, in consultation with the PBGCand the Labor Department, a completeapplication upon nding that the plan iseligible for the suspension and has satis-ed the criteria of section 432(e)(9)(C),(D), (E), and (F). An application must besubmitted electronically. After receiving a submission, the plan sponsor will be notied within two busi-ness days whether the submission consti-tutes a complete application. If the sub-mission is a complete application, theapplication will be treated as submitted onthe date on which it was originally sub-mitted to the Treasury Department. If asubmission is incomplete, the noticationwill inform the plan sponsor of the infor-mation that is needed to complete the sub- mission and give the plan sponsor a rea-sonable opportunity to submit a completeapplication. In such a case, the completeapplication will be treated as submitted onthe date on which the additional informa-tion needed to complete the application issubmitted to the Treasury Department. Additional guidance that may be nec- essary or appropriate with respect to ap-plications, including procedures for sub-mitting applications and the informationrequired to be included in a complete ap-plication, may be published in the form ofrevenue procedures, notices, or otherguidance published in the Internal Reve-nue Bulletin. In the case of a plan sponsor that is not submitting an application for suspensionin combination with an application toPBGC for a plan partition, the temporaryregulations provide that the applicationfor suspension generally will not be ac-cepted unless the proposed effective dateof the suspension is at least nine monthsafter the date on which the application issubmitted. This is to ensure adequate timeto review the proposed suspension with-out a need to delay the effective date ofthe proposed suspension. A delayed effec-tive date could require other changes tothe design of the suspension. For example,if, as a result of a delayed effective date,the age-based limitation under section432(e)(9)(D)(ii) applies to more partici-pants than under the terms of the proposedsuspension, then benets of other partici-pants may be subject to greater reductionsin order to satisfy the limitation in section 432(e)(9)(D)(iv) that the suspension, in the aggregate, must be reasonably estimated toachieve, but not materially exceed, the levelnecessary to avoid insolvency. However, inappropriate circumstances, an earlier effec-tive date may be permitted. Appropriate cir-cumstances could include an application fora proposed suspension that is a modicationof a previous submission that was with-drawn or denied. In the case of an application for sus- pension in combination with an applica-tion for partition, the impact of a delayedeffective date for the suspension would belarger benets for retirees rather than aredesign of the suspension. Accordingly, 12The completeness check is described under paragraph X. in this preamble (\"Approval or denial of an application for suspension of benets\"). Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 91these temporary regulations do not apply the rule described in the preceding para-graph to such an application. See Part4233 of the PBGC regulations for a coor-dinated application process that applies inthe case of a plan sponsor that is submit-ting an application for suspension in com-bination with an application to PBGC fora plan partition under section 4233 ofERISA. The temporary regulations provide that, no later than 30 days after receivinga complete application, the applicationwill be published on the web site of theDepartment of the Treasury, and the Trea-sury Department will publish a notice intheFederal Register soliciting comments from contributing employers, employeeorganizations, and participants and bene-ciaries of the plan for which an applica-tion was made, and other interested par-ties. The notice soliciting comments willgenerally request that comments be sub-mitted no later than 45 days after publica-tion of that notice in the Federal Regis- ter, but the comment period may be shorter in appropriate circumstances. Ap-propriate circumstances could include anapplication for a proposed suspension thatis a modication of a previous submissionthat was withdrawn or denied. Commentsreceived in response to this notice will bemade publicly available. Under the temporary regulations, a complete application will be deemed ap-proved unless, within 225 days after thecomplete application is submitted, theTreasury Department noties the plansponsor that its application does not sat-isfy one or more of the requirements forapproval. If the Treasury Department de-nies a plan sponsor's application, the no-tication of the denial will detail the spe-cic reasons for the denial, includingreference to the specic requirement orrequirements not satised. If the TreasuryDepartment approves a plan sponsor's ap-plication and believes that the plan is asystemically important plan, then theTreasury Department will notify the plansponsor of that belief and that it will berequired to provide individual participantdata upon request. This data may be usedin the event of a vote to reject the suspen-sion in order to assist the Treasury Depart-ment in determining whether to permit amodication of the rejected suspension.The temporary regulations provide that the Secretary of the Treasury may appointa Special Master for purposes of section432(e)(9). If a Special Master is ap-pointed, the Special Master will be anemployee of the Department of the Trea-sury, will coordinate the implementationof the regulations and the review of appli-cations for the suspension of benets andother appropriate documents, and willprovide recommendations to the Secretaryof the Treasury with respect to decisionsrequired under these regulations. Certain rules relating to the Treasury Department's review of an application un-der section 432(e)(9)(G) are included inthe proposed regulations. XI.Participant vote on proposed benet reduction The temporary regulations provide that if an application for suspension is ap-proved by the Treasury Department, thenthe Treasury Department, in consultationwith the PBGC and the Labor Depart-ment, will administer a vote of all planparticipants and all beneciaries of de-ceased participants (eligible voters). Anysuspension of benets will take effectonly after the vote and after a nal autho-rization to suspend benets. Under the temporary regulations, any ballot provided by the plan sponsor inconnection with a vote on the suspensionmust be approved by the Treasury Depart-ment, in consultation with the PBGC andthe Labor Department. The ballot must bewritten in a manner that can be readilyunderstood by the average plan participantand may not include any false or mislead-ing information. The information that isrequired to be included in the ballot isdescribed in the proposed regulations. The temporary regulations provide that unless a majority of all eligible voters voteto reject the suspension, it is permitted togo into effect. If a majority of all eligiblevoters vote to reject the suspension, thesuspension is not permitted to go into ef-fect, except that the suspension or a mod-ied suspension will be permitted to gointo effect if the plan is a systemicallyimportant plan as described later underthis paragraph XI. A plan sponsor is per-mitted to submit a new suspension appli-cation to the Treasury Department for ap-proval in any case in which a suspension is prohibited from taking effect as a resultof a vote. The temporary regulations set forth rules for systemically important plans. If amajority of all eligible voters vote to re-ject the suspension, the Treasury Depart-ment will consult with the PBGC and theLabor Department to determine if the planis a systemically important plan. TheTreasury Department is required to makethis determination no later than 14 daysafter the results of the vote are certied.No later than 30 days after a determina-tion that the plan is a systemically impor-tant plan, the Participant and Plan SponsorAdvocate selected under section 4004 ofERISA may submit recommendations tothe Treasury Department with respect tothe suspension or any revisions to the sus-pension. If a plan is a systemically important plan for which a majority of all eligiblevoters vote to reject the suspension, thenthe Treasury Department is required to either permit the implementation of thesuspension that was rejected by the voteor permit the implementation of a modi-cation of that suspension. Under anysuch modication, the plan must be pro-jected to avoid insolvency in accordancewith section 432(e)(9)(D)(iv). No laterthan 60 days after the results of a vote toreject a suspension are certied, the Trea-sury Department will notify the plan spon-sor that the suspension or modied sus-pension is permitted to be implemented. The temporary regulations dene a systemically important plan as a plan withrespect to which the PBGC projects thatthe present value of nancial assistancepayments will exceed $1.0 billion if thesuspension is not implemented. For calen-dar years beginning after 2015, this dollaramount will be replaced by an amountequal to the product of the dollar amountand a fraction, the numerator of which isthe contribution and benet base (deter-mined under section 230 of the SocialSecurity Act) for the preceding calendaryear and the denominator of which is thecontribution and benet base for calendaryear 2014. If that amount is not a multipleof $1.0 million, it will be rounded to thenext lowest multiple of $1.0 million. The temporary regulations provide that, in any case in which a proposed August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 92suspension (or a modication of a pro- posed suspension) is permitted to go intoeffect, the Treasury Department, in con-sultation with the PBGC and the LaborDepartment, will issue a nal authoriza-tion to suspend with respect to the suspen-sion. If a suspension is permitted to gointo effect following a vote, the nal au-thorization will be issued no later thanseven days after the vote. If a suspensionis permitted to go into effect following adetermination that the plan is a systemi-cally important plan, the nal authoriza-tion will be issued at a time sufcient toallow the implementation of the suspen-sion prior to the end of the 90-day periodbeginning on the date the results of thevote rejecting the suspension are certied.Under the temporary regulations, no laterthan 60 days after the certication, theTreasury Department will notify the plansponsor that the suspension that was re-jected by the vote or a modied suspen-sion is permitted to be implemented. The temporary regulations provide that, in any case in which a suspension ofbenets with respect to a plan is made incombination with a partition of the planunder section 4233 of ERISA, the suspen-sion of benets is not permitted to takeeffect prior to the effective date of thepartition. Effective/Applicability Date These regulations apply on and after June 17, 2015 and expire on June 15,2018.

(5)Examples . The following examples illustrate the requirement in paragraph(f)(1)(i) of this section to give notice to allparticipants, beneciaries of deceased par-ticipants, and alternate payees, exceptthose who cannot be contacted by reason-able efforts. Example 1 . (i)Facts . A plan sponsor distributes notice of a proposed suspension of benets to planparticipants, beneciaries of deceased participants,and alternate payees by mailing the notice to theirlast known mailing addresses, using the same infor-mation that it used to send the most recent annualfunding notice. Of 5,000 such notices, 300 werereturned as undeliverable. The plan sponsor takes noadditional steps to contact the individuals for whomthe notice was returned as undeliverable. (ii)Conclusion . The plan sponsor did not make any effort beyond the initial mailing to locate the 300individuals for whom the notice was returned asundeliverable. Therefore, the plan sponsor did notsatisfy the requirement to provide notice to all par-ticipants, beneciaries of deceased participants, andalternate payees under the plan (regardless ofwhether their benets are proposed to be suspended),except those who cannot be contacted by reasonable efforts. Example 2 . (i) Facts . The facts are the same as Example 1 , but the plan sponsor contacts the bar- gaining parties to locate the missing individuals forwhom the notice was returned as undeliverable. Theplan sponsor then uses an Internet search tool, acredit reporting agency, and a commercial locatorservice to search for individuals for whom it was notable to obtain updated information from bargainingparties. Through these efforts, the plan sponsor lo-cates the updated addresses of 250 of the 300 indi-viduals whom it previously failed to contact. Theplan sponsor mails notices to those individualswithin one week of locating them. (ii)Conclusion . By using effective search meth- ods to nd the previously missing individuals andpromptly mailing the notice of suspension to them,the plan sponsor has satised the requirement toprovide notice to all participants, beneciaries ofdeceased participants, and alternate payees underthe plan (regardless of whether their benets areproposed to be suspended), except those who can-not be contacted by reasonable efforts.

(ii)Complete application . After receiv- ing a submission, the plan sponsor will benotied within two business days whetherthe submission constitutes a complete ap-plication.

ACTION: Final rules. SUMMARY: This document contains - nal regulations regarding coverage of cer-tain preventive services under section 2713of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act),added by the Patient Protection and Afford-able Care Act, as amended, and incorpo-rated into the Employee Retirement IncomeSecurity Act of 1974 and the Internal Rev-enue Code. Section 2713 of the PHS Actrequires coverage without cost sharing ofcertain preventive health services by non-grandfathered group health plans and healthinsurance coverage. These regulations nal-ize provisions from three rulemaking ac-tions: interim nal regulations issued in July2010 related to coverage of preventive ser-vices, interim nal regulations issued in Au-gust 2014 related to the process an eligibleorganization uses to provide notice of itsreligious objection to the coverage of con-traceptive services, and proposed regula-tions issued in August 2014 related to thedenition of \"eligible organization,\" whichwould expand the set of entities that mayavail themselves of an accommodation withrespect to the coverage of contraceptiveservices. DATES: Effective Date : These nal reg- ulations are effective on September 14,2015. Applicability Date : These nal regula- tions are applicable beginning on the rstday of the rst plan year (or, for individualhealth insurance coverage, the rst day ofthe rst policy year) that begins on or afterSeptember 14, 2015.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148) was enactedon March 23, 2010. The Health Care andEducation Reconciliation Act of 2010(Pub. L. 111-152) was enacted on March30, 2010. These statutes are collectivelyknown as the Affordable Care Act. TheAffordable Care Act reorganizes, amends,and adds to the provisions of part A oftitle XXVII of the Public Health ServiceAct (PHS Act) relating to group healthplans and health insurance issuers in thegroup and individual markets. The Af-fordable Care Act adds section 715(a)(1)to the Employee Retirement Income Se-curity Act of 1974 (ERISA) and section9815(a)(1) to the Internal Revenue Code(Code) to incorporate the provisions ofpart A of title XXVII of the PHS Act intoERISA and the Code, and to make themapplicable to group health plans andhealth insurance issuers providing healthinsurance coverage in connection withgroup health plans. The sections of thePHS Act incorporated into ERISA and theCode are sections 2701 through 2728. Section 2713 of the PHS Act, as added by the Affordable Care Act and incorpo-rated into ERISA and the Code, requiresthat non-grandfathered group health plansand health insurance issuers offering non-grandfathered group or individual healthinsurance coverage provide coverage ofcertain specied preventive services with-out cost sharing. These preventive ser-vices include:Evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of \"A\" or \"B\" inthe current recommendations of theUnited States Preventive ServicesTask Force (Task Force) with respectto the individual involved. Immunizations for routine use in children, adolescents, and adults thathave in effect a recommendationfrom the Advisory Committee onImmunization Practices of the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Preven-tion (Advisory Committee) with re-spect to the individual involved. Arecommendation of the AdvisoryCommittee is considered to be \"ineffect\" after it has been adopted bythe Director of the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention (CDC).A recommendation is considered tobe for \"routine use\" if it appears onthe Immunization Schedules of theCDC. With respect to infants, children, and adolescents, evidence-informed pre-ventive care and screenings providedfor in the comprehensive guidelinessupported by the Health Resourcesand Services Administration (HRSA). With respect to women, preventive care and screenings provided for incomprehensive guidelines supportedby HRSA (not otherwise addressed bythe recommendations of the TaskForce), including all Food and DrugAdministration (FDA)-approved con-traceptives, sterilization procedures,and patient education and counselingfor women with reproductive ca-pacity, as prescribed by a healthcare provider (collectively, contra-ceptive services). 1 The complete list of recommendations and guidelines that are required to be cov-ered under these nal regulations can befound at: https://www.healthcare.gov/ preventive-care-benets . Together, the items and services described in these rec-ommendations and guidelines are referredto in this preamble as \"recommended pre-ventive services.\" The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury (the 1The HRSA Guidelines exclude services relating to a man's reproductive capacity, such as vasectomies and condoms. Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 99Departments)2have issued rulemaking to implement these requirements: Interim nal regulations on July 19, 2010, at 75 FR 41726 (July 2010 in-terim nal regulations), implementedthe preventive services requirementsof PHS Act section 2713; Interim nal regulations amending the July 2010 interim nal regulations onAugust 3, 2011, at 76 FR 46621, pro-vided HRSA with the authority to ex-empt group health plans established ormaintained by certain religious em-ployers (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection withthose plans) from the requirement tocover contraceptive services consistentwith the HRSA Guidelines; 3 Final regulations on February 15, 2012, at 77 FR 8725 (2012 nal reg-ulations), nalized the denition of re-ligious employer in the 2011 amendedinterim nal regulations without mod-ication; 4 An advance notice of proposed rule- making (ANPRM) on March 21,2012, at 77 FR 16501, solicited com-ments on how to provide for coverageof recommended preventive services,including contraceptive services, with-out cost sharing, while simultaneouslyensuring that certain nonprot organi-zations with religious objections tocontraceptive coverage would not berequired to contract, arrange, pay, orrefer for that coverage; Proposed regulations on February 6, 2013, at 78 FR 8456, proposed to sim-plify and clarify the denition of ligious employer\" for purposes of thereligious employer exemption, andproposed accommodations for grouphealth plans established or maintainedby certain nonprot religious organi-zations with religious objections tocontraceptive coverage (and grouphealth insurance coverage provided inconnection with those plans) and forinsured student plans arranged by cer-tain nonprot religious organizationsthat are institutions of higher educationwith religious objections to contracep-tive coverage; Final regulations on July 2, 2013, at 78 FR 39870 (July 2013 nal regula-tions), simplied and claried the def-inition of religious employer for pur-poses of the religious employerexemption and established accommo-dations for health coverage establishedor maintained or arranged by eligibleorganizations; 5. Interim nal regulations on August 27, 2014, at 79 FR 51092 (August 2014interim nal regulations), amended theJuly 2013 nal regulations in light ofthe United States Supreme Court's in- terim order in connection with an ap-plication for an injunction in Wheaton College v. Burwell (Wheaton interim order), 6and provided an alternative process that an eligible organizationmay use to provide notice of its reli-gious objection to the coverage of con-traceptive services; and Proposed regulations on August 27, 2014, at 79 FR 51118 (August 2014proposed regulations), proposed po- tential changes to the denition of \"el-igible organization\" in light of theUnited States Supreme Court's deci-sion in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. 7 In addition to these regulations, the De- partments released six sets of FrequentlyAsked Questions (FAQs) regarding thepreventive services coverage require-ments. The Departments released FAQsabout Affordable Care Act Implementa-tion Parts II, V, XII, XIX, XX, and XXVIto answer outstanding questions, includ-ing questions related to the coverage ofpreventive services. These FAQs providedguidance related to compliance with the2010 and 2014 interim nal regulations,and addressed issues related to specicservices required to be covered without costsharing, subject to reasonable medical man-agement, under recommendations andguidelines specied in section 2713 of thePHS Act. Information on related safe har-bors, forms, and model notices is availableathttp://www.dol.gov/ebsa/healthreform andhttp://www.cms.gov/cciio/ resources/ regulations-and-guidance/index.html. After consideration of the comments and feedback received from stakeholders,the Departments are publishing these nalregulations 8, which nalize the July 2010 interim nal regulations related to cover-age of recommended preventive services,the August 2014 interim nal regulationsrelated to the process an eligible organi-zation uses to provide notice of its reli-gious objection to the coverage of contra-ceptive services, and the August 2014 2Note, however, that in sections under headings listing only two of the three Departments, the term \"Departments\" generally refers only to the two Depa rtments listed in the heading. 3On the same date, HRSA exercised this authority in the HRSA Guidelines to exempt group health plans established or maintained by these religious emplo yers (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans) from the HRSA Guidelines with respect to contraceptive services. 4Contemporaneous with the issuance of the 2012 nal regulations, HHS, with the agreement of the Departments of Labor and the Treasury, issued guidance establishing a temporary safe harbor from enforcement of the contraceptive coverage requirement by the Departments for group health plans established or maintained by certain no nprot organizations with religious objections to contraceptive coverage (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans) originally issued on February 10 , 2012, and reissued on August 15, 2012, and June 28, 2013; available at: http://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Regulations-and-Guidance/Downloads/preventive-services-guidance-6-28-2013.pdf . The guidance claried, among other things, that plans that took some action before February 10, 2012, to try, without success, to exclude or limit contraceptive coverage were not p recluded from eligibility for the safe harbor. The temporary enforcement safe harbor was also available to student health insurance coverage arranged by nonprot institutions of higher e ducation with religious objections to contraceptive coverage that met the conditions set forth in the guidance. SeeStudent Health Insurance Coverage, 77 FR 16457 (Mar. 21, 2012). 5A contemporaneously re-issued HHS guidance document extended the temporary safe harbor from enforcement of the contraceptive coverage requiremen t by the Departments to encompass plan years beginning on or after August 1, 2013, and before January 1, 2014. This guidance included a form to be used by an organization during this tempo rary period to self-certify that its plan qualied for the temporary enforcement safe harbor. In addition, HHS and the Department of Labor (DOL) issued a self-certication form, EBSA Form 700, to be executed by an organization seeking to be treated as an eligible organization for purposes of an accommodation under the July 2013 nal regulations. This self-cert ication form was provided for use with the accommodation under the July 2013 nal regulations, after the expiration of the temporary enforcement safe harbor (that is, for plan years beginn ing on or after January 1, 2014).

Ct. 2806 (2014). 8The Department of the Treasury/Internal Revenue Service published temporary regulations and proposed regulations with the text of the temporary re gulations serving as the text of the proposed regulations as part of each of the joint rulemaking interim nal rules listed above. The Departments of Labor and HHS published their rules as interim nal rules and are nalizing their interim nal rules.

II. Overview of the Final Regulations A. Coverage of Recommended Preventive Services under 26 CFR54.9815-2713, 29 CFR 2590.715-2713,and 45 CFR 147.130 . (i)Scope of recommended preventive services Section 2713 of the PHS Act, as added by the Affordable Care Act, requires thata non-grandfathered group health plan ora health insurance issuer offering non-grandfathered group or individual healthinsurance coverage provide, without costsharing, coverage for recommended pre-ventive services, as outlined above. TheJuly 2013 nal regulations nalized therequirement to provide coverage withoutcost sharing with respect to those preven-tive services provided for in the HRSAGuidelines for women. These regulationsnalize the requirement to provide cover-age without cost sharing with respect tothe other three categories of recommenda-tions and guidelines specied in section2713 of the PHS Act: evidence-baseditems or services that have in effect arating of \"A\" or \"B\" in the current recom-mendations of the Task Force, immuniza-tions for routine use that have in effect arecommendation from the Advisory Com-mittee, and evidence-informed preventivecare and screenings for infants, children,and adolescents, provided for in guide-lines supported by HRSA. The completelist of Commenters requested ity on the specic items and services re-quired to be covered without cost sharing.The Departments previously releasedFAQs about Affordable Care Act Imple-mentation Parts XII 9and XIX10to pro- vide guidance related to the scope of cov- erage required under the recommendationsand guidelines, including coverage of aspi-rin and other over-the-counter medication, colonoscopies, BRCA testing, well-womanvisits, screening and counseling for and domestic violence, HIV and HPVtesting, contraception, breastfeeding andlactation counseling, and tobacco cessationinterventions. Moreover, on May 11, 2015,the Departments issued FAQs about Afford-able Care Act Implementation 11to address specic coverage questions related toBRCA testing, contraception, sex-specicrecommended preventive services, servicesfor dependents covered under the plan orpolicy, and colonoscopies. If additionalquestions arise regarding the application ofthe preventive services coverage require-ments, the Departments may issue addi-tional subregulatory guidance. (ii)Ofce visits The July 2010 interim nal regulations claried the cost-sharing requirements ap-plicable when a recommended preventiveservice is provided during an ofce visitthrough the use of the \"primary purpose\"test: First, if a recommended preventiveservice is billed separately (or is trackedas individual encounter data separately)from an ofce visit, a plan or issuer mayimpose cost sharing with respect to theofce visit. Second, if a recommendedpreventive service is not billed separately(or is not tracked as individual encounterdata separately) from an ofce visit andthe primary purpose of the ofce visit isthe delivery of the recommended preven-tive service, a plan or issuer may not im-pose cost sharing with respect to the ofcevisit. Finally, if a recommended preven-tive service is not billed separately (or isnot tracked as individual encounter dataseparately) from an ofce visit and theprimary purpose of the ofce visit is notthe delivery of the recommended preven-tive service, a plan or issuer may imposecost sharing with respect to the ofcevisit. The reference to tracking individualencounter data was included to provideguidance with respect to plans and issuersthat use capitation or similar payment ar-rangements that do not bill individually for items and services. Several commenters supported the pri- mary purpose test, while other comment-ers were concerned that the test providestoo much discretion to providers or issuersto determine the primary purpose of thevisit. Some commenters stated that manyindividuals only seek medical care from their physician when they are sick, and phy-sicians must be able to provide preventiveservices, along with other treatment, in asingle ofce visit. Other commenters rec-ommended that the Departments eliminatethe primary purpose test. Some of thesecommenters recommended that cost sharingbe prohibited if any recommended preven-tive service is provided during the visit. These nal regulations continue to pro- vide that when a recommended preventiveservice is not billed separately (or is nottracked as individual encounter data sep-arately) from an ofce visit, plans andissuers must look to the primary purposeof the ofce visit when determiningwhether they may impose cost sharingwith respect to the ofce visit. Nothing inthese requirements precludes a health careprovider from providing preventive ser-vices, along with other treatment, in asingle ofce visit. These rules only estab-lish the circumstances under which an of-ce visit that includes a recommendedpreventive service may be subject to costsharing. The Departments anticipate thatthe determination of the primary purposeof the visit will be resolved through nor-mal billing and coding activities, as theyare for other services. If questions ariseregarding the application of this rule tocommon medical scenarios, the Depart-ments may issue additional subregulatoryguidance. (iii)Out-of-network providers . With respect to a plan or health insur- ance coverage that maintains a network ofproviders, the July 2010 interim nal reg- ulations provided that the plan or issueris not required to provide coverage for 9SeeFAQs about Affordable Care Act Implementation Part XII, available at http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-aca12.html andhttp://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/ aca_implementation_faqs12.html 10SeeFAQs about Affordable at http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-aca19.html andhttp://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and- FAQs/aca_implementation_faqs19.html 11See FAQs about available at www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-FAQs/Downloads/aca_implementaton_faqs26.pdf andhttp://www.cms.gov/ CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/Downloads/aca_implementation_faqs26.pdf Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 2015 services deliv- ered by an out-of-network provider. Theplan or issuer may also impose costsharing for recommended preventiveservices delivered by an out-of-networkprovider. Several commenters requested the rule be amended to require that preventive ser-vices be provided without cost sharingwhen services are provided out-of-network in all instances. Other comment-ers suggested that the rule be amended torequire out-of-network coverage if an in-network provider is not available to theindividual, or if the services are not avail-able to a material segment of the plan'spopulation. One commenter asked that, in a situation where preventive services areobtained from a network provider with theassistance of medical professionals whoare out-of-network, all of the services betreated as in-network services, and thusnot subject to cost sharing. Several com-menters stated that cost sharing for rec-ommended preventive services receivedfrom out-of-network providers should notbe higher than cost sharing for other am-bulatory health services provided on anout-of-network basis. In response to comments, the Depart- ments issued an FAQ clarifying that, if aplan or issuer does not have in its networka provider who can provide a particularrecommended preventive service, then,consistent with the statute and July 2010interim nal regulations, the plan or issuermust cover, without cost sharing, the itemor service when performed by an out-of-network provider. 12These nal regulations adopt the rule of the July 2010 interim nal regulations with respect to out-of-network providers, with one clarica-tion. These nal regulations incorporatethe clarication that a plan or issuer thatdoes not have in its network a providerwho can provide a particular recom-mended preventive service is required tocover the preventive service when per- formed by an out-of-network provider,and may not impose cost sharing withrespect to the preventive service. (iv)Reasonable medical management . The July 2010 interim nal regulations included a provision on reasonable medi-cal management. Specically, if a recom-mendation or guideline for a recom-mended preventive service does notspecify the frequency, method, treatment,or setting for the provision of that service,the plan or issuer may use reasonablemedical management techniques to deter-mine any coverage limitations. The Departments received a number of comments related to the use of reasonablemedical management techniques. Somecommenters were concerned that the July2010 interim nal regulations did notclearly outline what constitutes reasonablemedical management techniques, and re-quested that the Departments providegreater clarity, particularly with respect toa situation where a patient's attendingprovider determines that the frequency,method, treatment, or setting of a partic-ular item or service is medically appropri-ate for a particular patient. The Depart-ments issued an FAQ clarifying that,under the July 2010 interim nal regula-tions, to the extent not specied in a rec-ommendation or guideline, a plan or is-suer may rely on the relevant evidencebase and established reasonable medicalmanagement techniques to determine thefrequency, method, treatment, or settingfor the provision of a recommended pre-ventive service. 13These nal regulations incorporate the clarication of the July2010 interim nal regulations set forth inthe FAQ. On May 11, 2015, the Departments issued FAQs to provide further guidanceon the extent to which plans and issuersmay utilize reasonable m edical manage- ment when providing coverage for rec-ommended women's contraception ser-vices in the HRSA guidelines. 14If further questions arise regarding thepermissible application of reasonablemedical management techniques, theDepartments may issue additional sub-regulatory guidance. Other commenters cited the impor- tance of flexibility to permit plans andissuers to maintain programs that are cost-effective, negotiate treatments with high-quality providers at reduced costs, andreduce fraud and abuse. Commenters re-quested guidance on how plans and issu-ers may employ value-based insurance de-signs (VBID) in a manner complieswith the preventive services coveragerequirements. 15Some commenters re- quested that the nal regulations permitplans and issuers to impose cost sharingon non-preferred network tiers for VBIDs.Another commenter requested the Depart-ments permit cost sharing for preventivecare delivered at centers of excellence. OnDecember 22, 2010, the Departmentsissued an FAQ to provide guidance re-garding VBID related to the coverage ofpreventive services. 16If questions arise regarding VBID and the preventive ser-vices coverage requirements, the De- partments may issue additional subregu-latory guidance. Several commentersstated that plans and issuers should berequired to use and identify credible ref-erences or sources supporting their med-ical management techniques. The De-partments recognize the importance ofhaving access to information relating tomedical management techniques that aplan or issuer may apply. Several provi-sions applicable to plans and issuers ad-dress these concerns. ERISA section104 and the Department of Labor's im- 12See FAQ about Affordable Care at http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-aca12.html andhttp://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and-FAQs/ aca_implementation_faqs12.html . 13SeeFAQs about Q8 available at http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-aca2.html andhttp://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and- FAQs/aca_implementation_faqs2.html 14SeeFAQs about Affordable at http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-aca26.html andhttp://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and- FAQs/Downloads/aca_implementation_faqs26.pdf . 15The Departments rst solicited comments on value-based insurance designs in the July 2010 interim nal regulations. 75 FR 41726, 41729. Subsequentl y, the Departments published a request for information (RFI) related to value-based insurance design on December 28, 2010. 75 FR 81544. 16SeeFAQs about Affordable Care Act Implementation Part V, Q1, available at http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/faqs/faq-aca5.html andhttp://www.cms.go/CCIIO/Resources/Fact-Sheets-and- FAQs/aca_implementation_faqs5.html . August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 regulations17provide that, for plans subject to ERISA, the plandocuments and other instruments underwhich the plan is established or operatedmust generally be furnished by the planadministrator to plan participants 18upon request. In addition, the Department ofLabor's claims procedure regulations 19 (applicable to ERISA plans), as well asthe Departments' internal claims and ap-peals and external review regulationsunder the Affordable Care Act (applica-ble to all non-grandfathered grouphealth plans and health insurance issuersin the group and individual markets), 20 set forth rules regarding claims and ap-peals, including the right of claimants (or their authorized representatives),upon appeal of an adverse benet deter-mination (or a nal internal adversebenet determination), to be providedby the plan or issuer, upon request andfree of charge, reasonable access to andcopies of all documents, records, andother information relevant to the claim-ant's claim for benets. Other Federaland State law requirements may alsoapply, as applicable. (v)Services not described . The July 2010 interim nal regulations claried that a plan or issuer may coverpreventive services in addition to thoserequired to be covered by PHS Act section2713. These nal regulations continue toprovide that for the additional preventiveservices, a plan or issuer may impose costsharing at its discretion, consistent withapplicable law. Moreover, a plan or issuermay impose cost sharing for a treatmentthat is not a recommended preventive ser-vice, even if the treatment results from arecommended preventive service.(vi)Timing . The July 2010 interim nal regulations provided that plans and issuers must pro-vide coverage for new recommended pre-ventive services for plan years (in the in-dividual market, policy years) beginningon or after the date that is one year afterthe date the relevant recommendation orguideline under PHS Act section 2713 isissued. Some commenters encouraged theDepartments to adopt a shorter implemen-tation timeframe. With respect to the Ad-visory Committee recommendations, onecommenter requested that the effectivedate for any new recommendation be ei-ther the publication of the committee'sprovisional recommendations or the pub-lication of the ofcial CDC immunizationschedules, whichever occurs rst. Othercommenters expressed support for the im-plementation timeframe set forth in theJuly 2010 interim nal regulations. Thestatute requires the Departments to estab-lish an interval of not less than one yearbetween when recommendations orguidelines under PHS Act section2713(a) 21are issued, and the plan year (in the individual market, policy year)for which coverage of the services ad-dressed in the recommendations orguidelines must be in effect. To provide plans and issuers adequate time to incorporate changes or updates torecommendations and guidelines, as pro-vided in the July 2010 interim nal regu-lations, these nal regulations continue toprovide that a recommendation or guide-line of the Task Force is considered to beissued on the last day of the month onwhich the Task Force publishes or other-wise releases the recommendation; a rec-ommendation or guideline of the Advi-sory Committee is considered to be issuedon the date on which it is adopted by theDirector of the CDC; and a recommenda- tion or guideline in the comprehensiveguidelines supported by HRSA is consid-ered to be issued on the date on which it isaccepted by the Administrator of HRSAor, if applicable, adopted by the Secretaryof HHS. Several commenters supported the pol- icy that plans and issuers should not needto check the recommendations or guide-lines for changes during the plan or policyyear in order to determine coverage re-quirements and should not be required toimplement changes during the plan or pol-icy year. The Departments adopted thisapproach in the July 2010 interim nalregulations with respect to new recom-mendations or guidelines that impose ad-ditional preventive services coverage re-quirements, but adopted a differentstandard for changes in recommendationsor guidelines, allowing plans and issuersto eliminate coverage for preventive ser-vices that are no longer recommended during the plan or policy year, consistentwith other applicable federal and statelaw. We agree with those commenterswho stated that changes in coverageshould not occur during the plan or policyyear, and are implementing an approachwith respect to changes in recommenda-tions or guidelines that narrow or elimi-nate coverage requirements for previouslyrecommended services that is similar tothe one adopted in the July 2010 interimnal regulations for new recommenda-tions or guidelines. Furthermore, partici-pants and beneciaries of group healthplans (and enrollees and dependents inindividual market coverage) may makecoverage choices based on the benetsoffered at the beginning of the plan orpolicy year. Plan years (and individualmarket policy years) 3(7) denes a \"participant\" to include any employee or former employee who is or may become eligible to receive a benet of any type from an employee benet plan or whose beneciaries may be eligible to receive any such benet. Accordingly, employees who are not enrolled but are, for example, in a waiting period for coverage, or who are otherwise shopping among benet package options during open season, generally are considered plan participants for this purpose. 1929 CFR to an interval between \"the date on which a recommendation described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) or a guideline under sub section (a)(3) is issued and the plan year with respect to which the requirement described in subsection (a) is effective with respect to the service described in such recommendation or gu ideline.\" While the rst part of this statement does not mention guidelines under subsection (a)(4), it is the Departments' view that it would not be reasonable to treat the services cover ed under subsection (a)(4) any differently than those in subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3). First, the statement refers to \"the requirement described in subsection (a),\" which would incl ude a requirement under subsection (a)(4). Secondly, the guidelines under (a)(4) are from the same source as those under (a)(3), except with respect to women, rather than infants, children and a dolescents; and other preventive services involving women are addressed in subsection (a)(1), so it is reasonable to treat the guidelines under subsection (a)(4) similarly. Third, without th is clarication, it would be unclear when such services would have to be covered. The July 2010 interim nal regulations and these nal regulations accordingly apply the intervals establishe d therein to services under section 2713(a)(4). Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 103dations and guidelines may be issued at any time during a plan or policy year.These nal regulations protect against dis-ruption and provide certainty in coverage(including cost-sharing requirements) forthe duration of the plan or policy year.Accordingly, these nal regulations statethat a plan or issuer that is required to pro-vide coverage for any recommended pre-ventive service on the rst day of a plan orpolicy year under a particular recommenda-tion or guideline must generally provide thatcoverage through the last day of the plan orpolicy year, even if the recommendation orguideline changes or is eliminated duringthe plan or policy year. However, there are limited circum- stances under which it may be inadvisablefor a plan or issuer to continue to coverpreventive items or services associatedwith a recommendation or guideline thatwas in effect on the rst day of a plan yearor policy year (for example, due to safetyconcerns). Therefore, these nal regula-tions establish that if, during a plan or policy year, (1) an \"A\" or \"B\" recommen- dation or guideline of the Task Force thatwas in effect on the rst day of a plan orpolicy year is downgraded to a \"D\" rating(meaning that the Task Force has deter-mined that there is strong evidence thatthere is no net benet, or that the harmsoutweigh the benets, and therefore dis-courages the use of this service), or (2)any item or service associated with anypreventive service recommendation orguideline specied in CFR 147.130(a)(1) that was in effecton the rst day of a plan or policy year isthe subject of a safety recall or is other-wise determined to pose a signicantsafety concern by a federal agency autho-rized to regulate that item or service, thereis no requirement under this section tocover these items and services through thelast day of the plan or policy year. Shouldsuch circumstances arise, the Departmentsexpect to issue subregulatory guidance tothis effect with respect to such preventiveitem or service. Other requirements of federal or state law may apply in connection with ceasingto provide coverage or changing cost- sharing requirements for any item or ser-vice. For example, PHS Act section2715(d)(4) and its implementing regula-tions state that if a group health plan or health insurance issuer makes any ma-terial modication in any of the terms ofthe plan or coverage involved thatwould affect the content of the Sum-mary of Benets and Coverage (SBC),that is not reflected in the most recentlyprovided SBC, and that occurs otherthan in connection with a renewal orreissuance of coverage, the plan or is-suer must provide notice of the modi-cation to enrollees not later than 60 daysprior to the date on which the notica-tion will become effective. A list of the recommended preventive ser- vices is available at https://www.healthcare. gov/preventive-care-benets . We intend to update this list to include the date onwhich the recommendation or guidelinewas accepted or adopted. New recommen-dations and guidelines will also be re-flected on this site. Plans and issuers neednot make changes to coverage and cost-sharing requirements based on a new rec-ommendation or guideline until the rstplan year (in the individual market, policyyear) beginning on or after the date that isone year after the new recommendation orguideline goes into effect. Therefore, byvisiting this site once per year, plans orissuers should have access to all the infor-mation necessary to identify any addi-tional items or services that must be cov-ered without cost sharing, or to identifyany items or services that are no longerrequired to be covered. B. Accommodations in Connection with Coverage of Preventive Health Services- 26 CFR 54.9815-2713A, 29 CFR2510.3-16 and 2590.715-2713A, and 45CFR 147.131. (i) The process an eligible organization uses to provide notice of its religiousobjection to the coverage ofcontraceptive services. After issuing the July 2013 nal regu- lations, the Departments issued August2014 interim nal regulations in light of the Supreme Court's Wheaton interim or- der concerning notice to the federal gov-ernment that an eligible organization has areligious objection to providing contra-ceptive coverage, as an alternative to theEBSA Form 700 method of self-certication, and to preserve participants'and beneciaries' (and, in the case of stu-dent health insurance coverage, enrollees'and dependents') access to coverage forthe full range of FDA-approved contra-ceptives, as prescribed by a health careprovider, without cost sharing. These nal regulations continue to al- low eligible organizations to choose be-tween using EBSA Form 700 or the alter-native process consistent with theWheaton interim order. The alternative process provides that an eligible organiza-tion may notify HHS in writing of itsreligious objection to covering all or asubset of contraceptive services. The no-tice must include the name of the eligibleorganization and the basis on which it qualies for an accommodation; its objec-tion based on sincerely held religious be-liefs to covering some or all contraceptiveservices, as applicable (including an iden-tication of the subset of contraceptiveservices to which coverage the eligibleorganization objects, if applicable); theplan name and type (that is, whether it isa student health insurance plan within themeaning of 45 CFR 147.145(a) or achurch plan within the meaning of ERISAsection 3(33)); and the name and contactinformation for any of the plan's thirdparty administrators and health insuranceissuers. 22A model notice to HHS that eligible organizations may, but are notrequired to, use is available at: http:// www.cms.gov/cciio/resources /Regulations- and-Guidance/index.html#Prevention .I f there is a change in any of the informationrequired to be included, the organizationmust provide updated information toHHS. The content required for the notice rep- resents the minimum information neces-sary for the Departments to determinewhich entities are covered by the accom-modation, to administer the accommoda- 22Church plans are exempt from ERISA pursuant to ERISA section 4(b)(2). As such, a third party administrator of a self-insured church plan established o r maintained by an eligible organization does not become the plan administrator by operation of 29 CFR 2510.3-16, although such third party administrators may voluntarily prov ide or arrange separate payments for contraceptive services and seek reimbursement for associated expenses under the process set forth in 45 CFR 156.50. August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 104tion, and to implement the policies in the July 2013 nal regulations.23Comments on the August 2014 interim nal regulationsdid not identify any way to administer theaccommodation without this information, orany alternative means the Departments canuse to obtain the required information.Nothing in this alternative notice process (orin the EBSA Form 700 notice process) pro-vides for a government assessment of thesincerity of the religious belief underlyingthe eligible organization's objection. Thenotice to HHS, and any subsequent up-dates, should be sent electronically to:marketreform@cms.hhs.gov , or by regular mail to: Centers for Medicare & MedicaidServices, Center for Consumer Informa-tion and Insurance Oversight, 200 Inde-pendence Avenue SW, Washington, D.C,20201, Room 739H. When an eligible organization that es- tablishes or maintains a self-insured plansubject to ERISA provides a notice toHHS, the Department of Labor (DOL)(working with HHS) will send a separatenotication to each third party administra-tor of the ERISA plan. The DOL noti-cation will inform each third party admin-istrator of the eligible organization'sreligious objection to funding or adminis-tering some or all contraceptive coverage,will list the contraceptive services towhich the employer objects, will describe the obligations of the third party adminis-trator(s) under 29 CFR 2590.715-2713Aand 26 CFR 54.9815-2713A, and willdesignate relevant admin-istrator(s) as administrator undersection 3(16) of ERISA for those contra-ceptive benets that the third party admin-istrator would otherwise manage on be-half of the eligible organization. The DOLnotication will be an instrument underwhich the plan is operated, and will su-persede any earlier designation. In estab-lishing and implementing this alternativeprocess, DOL is exercising its broad rule-making authority under title I of ERISA,which includes the ability to interpret andapply the denition of a plan administra-tor under ERISA section 3(16)(A).If an eligible organization that estab- lishes or maintains an insured grouphealth plan or insured student health planprovides a notice to HHS under this alter-native process, HHS will send a separatenotication to each health insurance issuerof the plan. HHS's notication will informeach health insurance issuer of the eligibleorganization's religious objection to fund-ing or administering some or all contra-ceptive coverage, will list the contracep-tive services to which the organizationobjects, and will describe the obligationsof the issuer(s) responsiblefor compliance with the statutory and reg-ulatory requirement to provide coveragefor contraceptive services without costsharing to participants and beneciaries ofinsured group health plans, and to enroll-ees and dependents of insured studenthealth plans, notwithstanding that the pol-icyholder is an eligible organization witha religious objection to contraceptive cov-erage that will not have to contract, ar-range, pay, or refer for the coverage. Several comments addressed oversight and enforcement to monitor the accom-modation. The Departments will use theirestablished oversight processes, applica-ble to all the Affordable Care Act marketreforms of PHS Act title XXVII, part A tomonitor compliance with the requirementto arrange for or provide separate pay-ments for contraceptive services withoutcost sharing. 24 (ii)Denition of a closely held for-prot entity. (a)General structure of a closely held for-prot entity. After issuing the July 2013 nal regu- lations, the Departments issued August2014 proposed regulations in light of theSupreme Court's ruling in Hobby Lobby , that, under the Religious Freedom Resto-ration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 25the require- ment to provide contraceptive coveragecould not be applied to certain closely held for-prot entities that had a religiousobjection to providing coverage for someor all the FDA-approved contraceptivemethods. The proposed regulations solic-ited comments on a number of differentapproaches for dening a closely held for-prot entity for purposes of qualifying asan eligible organization that can avail it-self of an accommodation, and solicitedcomments on a number of other relatedissues. The Departments received more than 75,000 comments in response to the Au-gust 2014 proposed regulations. Numer-ous comments addressed matters outsidethe scope of the proposed regulations (forexample, many comments expressed sup-port for or disagreement with the SupremeCourt's Hobby Lobby decision, contracep- tion in general, or different methods ofcontraception), and are not addressed inthis preamble. To the extent commentsaddressed matters that were within thescope of the proposed regulations, thoseportions of the comments were consid-ered, and all signicant comments relatedto matters within the scope of the pro-posed regulations are discussed in thispreamble. Many commenters expressedsupport for or disagreement with the gen-eral requirement to provide coverage forcontraceptive services without cost shar- ing. Some commenters expressed supportfor the notion that any employer that hasreligious objections to covering contra-ceptive services should either be exemptfrom doing so, or should be able to availitself of the accommodation. Other com-menters stated that women should haveaccess to contraceptive services withoutcost sharing, regardless of where theywork, and that employers should not bepermitted to deny them coverage, whetherthe employer's decision is for religious orother reasons. Many commenters sug-gested that the set of closely held for-prot entities eligible for the accommoda-tion be dened as narrowly as possible. The August 2014 proposed regulations would extend the availability of the ac- 23An accommodation cannot be effectuated until all of the necessary information is submitted. If HHS receives a notice that does not include all of the re quired information, HHS will attempt to notify the organization of the incompleteness, so the organization can submit additional information to make its notice complete. 24The Departments' oversight and enforcement role with respect to the market reforms under the Affordable Care Act builds upon their respective roles w ith respect to the market reforms under title I of HIPAA. For a description of the latter, seeNotice of Signing of a Memorandum of Understanding among the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Health and Human Services at 64 FR 70165 (Dec. 15, 1999). 2542 U.S.C. 2000bb Bulletin No. 2015-31 2015 105commodation to closely held for-prot en- tities. The preamble proposed two possi-ble approaches to dening a closely heldfor-prot entity. Under the rst proposedapproach, a qualifying closely held for-prot entity would be a for-prot entitywhere none of the ownership interests inthe entity are publicly traded, and wherethe entity has fewer than a specied num-ber of shareholders or owners (the Depart-ments did not propose a specic number,but solicited comment on what the num-ber should be). As explained in the pre-amble to the August 2014 proposed regu-lations, there is precedent in other areas offederal law for limiting the denition ofclosely held entities to those with a rela-tively small number of owners. 26Under the second proposed approach, a qualify-ing closely held entity would be a for-prot entity in which the ownership inter-ests are not publicly traded, and in whicha specied fraction of the ownership in-terest is concentrated in a limited andspecied number of owners (the Depart-ments did not propose a specic level ofownership concentration but solicitedcomment on what that level should be).As explained in the preamble to the Au-gust 2014 proposed regulations, this ap-proach also has precedent in federal law,which limits certain tax treatment to enti-ties that are more than 50 percent ownedby or for not more than ve individuals. 27 The Departments invited comments on theappropriate scope of the denition of aqualifying closely held for-prot entity. As explained in more detail below, these nal regulations extend the accom-modation to a for-prot entity that is notpublicly traded, is majority-owned by arelatively small number of individuals,and objects to providing based on its owners' religiousbeliefs. This denition includes for-prot entities that are controlled and operated byindividual owners who are likely to haveassociational ties, are personally identiedwith the entity, and can be regarded asconducting personal business affairsthrough the entity. Those entities appearto be the types of closely held for-protentities contemplated by Hobby Lobby , which involved two family-owned corpo-rations that were operated in accordancewith their owners' shared religious be-liefs. 28The Departments also believe that the denition adopted in these regulationsincludes the for-prot entities that arelikely to have religious objections to pro-viding contraceptive coverage. That as-sessment is supported by the commentsreceived on the proposed regulation. Asexplained below, the Departments soughtcomment on a denition similar to the oneadopted here, and we believe that no com-menter identied an entity that wouldwant to avail itself of the accommodationbut that would be excluded by the deni-tion. In addition, based on the availableinformation, it appears that the denitionadopted in these nal regulations includesall of the for-prot entities that have as ofthe date of issuance of these regulationschallenged the contraceptive coverage re-quirement in court. The Departments believe that the de- nition adopted in these regulations com-plies with and goes beyond what is re-quired by RFRA and Hobby Lobby . The Departments have extended the accom-modations to the specied class of for-prot entities in order to provide addi-tional protection to entities that may havereligious objections to providing contra-ceptive coverage, and because the Depart-ments believe that eligibility for the ac-commodations should be based on a rulethat has origins in existing law. Under the August 2014 proposed reg- ulations and these nal regulations, therst prong that an eligible organization(whether it be a nonprot entity or aclosely held for-prot entity) must meet inorder to avail itself of the accommodationis that the entity must oppose providingcoverage for some or all of any contracep- tive item or service required to be cov-ered, on account of religious objections.This requirement remains unchanged inthese nal regulations. (In the case of afor-prot entity, the entity must be op-posed to providing these services on ac-count of its owners' religious objections).Many commenters supported exclud- ing publicly traded entities from the de-nition of a closely held for-prot entity.However, a few commenters stated that apublicly traded entity should not be dis-qualied from the accommodation. Al-though the entities in Hobby Lobby were not publicly traded, one commenter notedthat the Court did not expressly precludepublicly traded corporations from the pro-tections of RFRA. Another commenterstated that if a publicly traded corporationcould provide evidence of a sincere reli-gious objection to providing contraceptivecoverage, it should not be precluded fromthe accommodation. These nal regulations exclude pub- licly traded entities from the denition ofan eligible organization. Hobby Lobby did not involve RFRA's application to pub-licly traded companies, and the SupremeCourt emphasized that \"the idea that un-related shareholders - including institu-tional investors with their own sets ofstakeholders - would agree to run a cor-poration under the same religious beliefsseems improbable.\" 29 Many commenters favored limiting the number of to \"a handful,\" withoutspecifying a maximum number. One com-menter urged the Departments to establisha limit on the maximum number of share-holders for closely held entities of 999. One commenter favored limiting the number of owners, but stated that anyparticular limit could lead to anomalousresults for entities with more than the per-mitted number of owners that seek theaccommodation. The commenter noted,for example, that if the maximum numberof shareholders or owners is ten, non-publicly traded companies with elevenshareholders would have to provide con-traceptive coverage, no matter how sin-cerely held the religious objections of the owners. Another commenter who favoredthe approach stated that the denitionshould be limited to entities that have tenor fewer shareholders, and that sharehold-ers should be counted based upon the def-initions under subchapte r S - that is, in- dividuals should be counted along with 26Seediscussion of denition of S corporations under section 1361 of the Tax Code, at 79 FR 51122. 27See discussion of several Tax code provisions, including 856(h), 542(a)(2), and August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 106certain trusts and estates. This would ac- count for Qualied Subchapter S Trusts,but would not allow for other partnershipsor corporations to be shareholders. Thiscommenter also urged that members ofthe same family be counted as separateshareholders. Another commenter ex-plained that a closely held company iscommonly understood to be one thatchooses S-corporation status or has fewerthan 100 shareholders, and that many areprivately held and owned by family mem-bers. Beyond these characteristics, thecommenter urged, the size of the companyshould not matter. One commenter sug-gested following the close corporation denition from the applicable state or, inthe absence of a corporate form, followingthe denition of a close corporation underDelaware law. A few commenters supported a test that would be aligned with one of thefederal tax law's denitions of a\"closely held corporation.\" For supported a denitionthat provides that the corporation maynot have ownership interests that arepublicly traded, that more than 50 per-cent of the outstanding ownership inter-ests in the corporation must be owned(directly or indirectly) by ve or fewerindividuals at any time during the lasthalf of the tax year, and that the corpo-ration may not be a personal servicecorporation. The commenters favoredidentifying closely held entities throughan approach based on this denition be-cause such an approach would be easyto apply and already familiar to corpo-rations that apply similar concepts underthe Code. Other comm enters were generally op- posed to a limited ownership-concentrationtest. One commenter observed that underthis approach, a corporation would be ableto concentrate a fraction of ownership, forexample 50 percent, in a specied numberof owners, such as ten people. The com-menter observed that those ten individuals,who might comprise fewer than half of thetotal number of owners, would be able todirect the corporation to seek the accommo-dation, potentially against the wishes of the minority shareholders. Several commenters suggested that basing the denition either on the numberof owners, or upon a concentration ofownership, would be inappropriate. Onecommenter stated that there is no basis intheHobby Lobby decision to restrict the denition based on measures such asshareholder numbers, fractions of owner-ship, or tax rules. Another commenterstated that each of the proposed deni-tions of a \"closely held corporation\" isbased on an arbitrary metric unrelated tothe religious beliefs of the owners of thecorporation. Another commenter statedthat any rule that denes \"closely held\" ina narrow manner, such as by limiting thenumber, kind, or percentage control of ashare of its owners, or by adopting de-nitions used in the Code, will violateRFRA and the Hobby Lobby decision. One commenter stated that a numericaltest of shareholders will be both under-and over-inclusive, capturing corporationsthat meet the numerical test but whoseshareholders are not expressing a religiousbelief through the corporation, and failingto capture corporations with a relatively large number of shareholders united intheir religious interests. Another com-menter believed that basing the denitionof \"closely held entity\" solely on the num-ber of owners would not limit eligibility tothose types of entities addressed in theHobby Lobby case. One commenter believed that, for pur- poses of qualifying for the accommoda-tion, an entity should only employ indi-viduals who adhere to the owners'religious beliefs. The Departments do notbelieve this is a necessary characteristicfor an entity to qualify as an eligible or-ganization that can avail itself of the ac-commodation, and in Hobby Lobby the court granted relief to companies that didnot possess this feature. Additionally,while the Departments have noted thatexempting churches and their integratedauxiliaries (which the regulations refer toas \"religious employers\") from the re-quirement to provide contraceptive cover-age does not impermissibly undermine thegovernment's compelling interests in pro- moting public health and ensuring thatwomen have equal access to health carebecause churches are more likely to hireco-religionists, 30the exemption to the contraceptive coverage requirement wasprovided against the backdrop of the long-standing governmental recognition of aparticular sphere of autonomy for housesof worship, such as the special treatmentgiven to those organizations in theCode. 31This exemption for churches and houses of worship is consistent with theirspecial status under longstanding traditionin our society and under federal law, andis not a mere product of the likelihood thatthese institutions hire coreligionists. Hir-ing coreligionists is not itself a determi-native factor as to whether an organizationshould be accommodated or exemptedfrom the contraceptive requirements. Another commenter stated that owner- ship of the entity should be limited tofamily members. The Departments do notbelieve that ownership of a closely heldfor-prot entity eligible for the accommo-dation should be limited to members ofone family. Although many closely heldcorporations are family-owned, existing state and federal denitions of closelyheld or close corporations do not typicallyinclude this requirement. As stated below,however, for purposes of these nal reg-ulations, an individual is considered toown the ownership interests owned, di-rectly or indirectly, by or for his or herfamily, meaning brothers and sisters (in-cluding half-brothers and half-sisters),spouses, ancestors, and lineal descen-dants. The Departments agree with thecommenters who urged us to dene aclosely held entity, for purposes of theseregulations, based on an existing federaldenition. The Departments believe thatthis approach will minimize confusion forentities seeking the accommodation. At the same time, the Departments also recognize the need for flexibility in thedenition for purposes of the accommo-dation. Therefore, the Departments areadopting in these regulations a denitionthat is generally based on - but is moreflexible than - the denition of a No. 2015 107held corporation found in the Code32 (which we refer to as the tax-law deni- tion). Under the tax-law denition, a closelyheld corporation is a corporation that hasmore than 50 percent of the value of itsoutstanding stock owned (directly or indi-rectly) by ve or fewer individuals at anytime during the last half of the tax year, andis not a personal service corporation. 33The denitions for closely held corporation invarious Code provisions reference the own-ership test for personal holding companiescontained in Code section 542(a)(2), whichgenerally has the effect of identifying thosecorporations that are controlled by a smallgroup of individuals and closely afliatedwith their owners. Drawing on the tax-law denition, with appropriate modications to reflect the context here, these regulations establish thatto be eligible for the accommodation, aclosely held, for-prot entity must, amongother criteria, be an entity that is not a non-prot entity, and have more than 50 percentof the value of its ownership interests owneddirectly or indirectly by ve or fewer indi-viduals, or must have an ownership struc-ture that is substantially similar. As previously stated, for purposes of dening a closely held for-prot entity inthese regulations, the Departments are us-ing a denition that is more flexible thanthe tax-law denition of closely held cor-poration. Because the Departments be-lieve that the tax-law denition might ex-clude some entities that should beconsidered to be closely held for purposesof the accommodation, and because somefor-prot entities may have unusual ornon-traditional ownership structures notreadily analyzed under the 5/50 test, thedenition under these nal regulationsalso includes, as stated above, entitieswith ownership structures that are \"sub-stantially similar\" to structures that satisfythe 5-owner/50-percent requirement. For example, an entity where 49 per- cent of the value of the outstanding own-ership interests are owned directly by six individuals could also qualify as a closelyheld for-prot entity because it has an own-ership structure that is substantially similarto one in which ve or fewer individuals hold at least 50 percent of the value of theoutstanding ownership interests. As another example, an entity owned by a series of corporate parents, whereamong the ultimate stockholders are anonprot entity and a for-prot corpora-tion with three individual owners, whocollectively own 45 percent of the out-standing ownership interests, also has asubstantially similar ownership structure. We note, however, that a publicly traded entity would not qualify as having a sub-stantially similar ownership structure. For purposes of the accommodation, the value of the ownership interests in theentity, whether the total ownership inter- ests or those owned by ve or fewer indi-viduals, should be calculated based on allownership interests, regardless of whetherthey have associated voting rights or anyother privileges. This is consistent withhow the tax-law denition of a closelyheld corporation is applied. Because the accommodation will be sought on a prospective basis, the Depart-ments do not believe it appropriate to in-corporate, from the tax-law denition, thetime interval over which the test is mea-sured - that the given ownership structurebe in place during the last half of the taxyear -and instead adopt a test that is mea-sured as of the date of the entity's self-certication or notice of its objection toprovide contraceptive services on accountof religious objections. The tax-law denition of \"closely held corporation\" excludes certain \"personalservices corporations,\" such as accountingrms, actuarial science rms, architecturerms, and law rms. Although there arelegitimate reasons for excluding personalservice rms from the denition of\"closely held corporation\" for purposes oftaxation, the Departments do not believethe distinction is necessary in this context.Therefore, a personal services corporationmay qualify as a closely held for-protentity under these nal regulations, pro-vided it satises the other criteria. Following the tax-law denition, to de- termine if more than 50 percent of the valueof the ownership interests is owned by ve or fewer individuals, the following rules apply: Ownership interests owned by or for a corporation, partnership, estate, ortrust are considered owned proportion-ately by the entity's shareholders, part-ners, or beneciaries. For example, if afor-prot entity is 100 percent ownedby a partnership, and the partnership isowned 100 percent by four individu-als, the for-prot entity, for purposesof these regulations, is considered tobe owned 100 percent by those fourindividuals. An individual is considered to own the ownership interests owned, directly orindirectly, by or for his or her family.The \"family\" includes only brothersand sisters (including half-brothersand half-sisters), a spouse, ancestors,and lineal descendants. Accordingly,the family members count as a singleowner for purposes of these nal reg-ulations. If a person holds an option to purchase ownership interests, he or she is con-sidered to be the owner of those own-ership interests. To assist potentially eligible for-prot entities seeking further information re-garding whether they qualify for the ac-commodation, an entity may send a letterdescribing its ownership structure to HHSat accommodation@cms.hhs.gov .If the entity does not receive a response fromHHS to a properly submitted letter describ-ing the entity's current ownership structurewithin 60 calendar days, as long as the entitymaintains that structure, it will be consid-ered to meet the requirement set forth in 26CFR 54.9815-2713A(a)(4)(iii), 29 USC2590.715-2713A(a)(4)(iii), and 45 CFR147.131(b)(4)(iii). However, an entity is not required to avail itself of this process in orderto qualify as a closely held for-prot entity. Based on the information available, it appears that the denition of closely heldfor-prot entity set forth in these nalregulations includes all the for-prot cor- porations that have led lawsuits allegingthat the require- 32Code section 469(j)(1) states the \"term 'closely held C corporation' means any C corporation described in section 465(a)(1)(B).\" Section 465(a)(1) (B) provides \"a C corporation with respect to which the stock ownership requirement of paragraph (2) of section 542(a) is met.\" Section 542(a)(2) provides that the applicable stock own ership requirement is met if \"[a]t any time during the last half of the taxable year more than 50 percent in value of its outstanding stock is owned, directly or indirectly, by or for not more th an 5 individuals.\" Similarly, section 856(h)(1)(A) provides \"a corporation, trust, or association is closely held if the stock ownership requirement of section 542(a)(2) is met.\" 33See http://www.irs.gov/Help-&-Resources/Tools-&-FAQs/FAQs-for-Individuals/Frequently-Asked-Tax-Questions-&-Answers/Small-Busines s,-Self-Employed,-Other-Business/Entities/Entities-5 . August 3, 108ment, absent an accommodation, violates RFRA. One commenter stated that the deni- tion should include any for-prot entitythat is controlled directly or indirectly bya nonprot eligible organization. The De-partments agree, because in this case thenonprot entity will represent one share-holder that owns more than 50 percent ofthe ownership interests in the for-protentity. 34The same facts and circum- stances that are considered in determiningwhether a given for-prot entity qualiesas an eligible for-prot organization underthese nal regulations will also applywhen one or more of its owners is a non-prot organization. For purposes of theownership concentration test set forth inthese nal regulations that applies to for-prot entities, a nonprot organizationthat has an ownership interest in a for-prot entity will be considered one indi-vidual owner of the for-prot entity, andthe non-prot organization's beattributed to that nonprot organization. (b)The process for making the decision to object to covering contraceptiveservices . The August 2014 proposed regulations proposed that a closely held for-prot en-tity's objection to covering some or all ofthe contraceptive services otherwise re-quired to be covered on account of itsowners' sincerely held religious beliefsmust be made in accordance with the or-ganization's applicable rules of gover-nance, consistent with state law. Somecomments proposed alternative or addi- tional criteria for how the decision mustbe made. One criterion suggested by manycommenters was unanimity among allowners regarding opposition to contracep-tion. However, one commenter objectedto this requirement, stating that the regu-lations should not require unanimousshareholder consent because neither theHobby Lobby decision nor state corporate law imposes such a requirement. Some commenters favored requiring each equity holder to certify, under pen-alty of perjury, that he or she has a reli-gious objection to the entity providing contraceptive coverage. These nal regulations do not adopt a requirement that the owners unanimouslydecide that the entity will not offer con-traceptive coverage based on a religiousobjection, or that any equity holder certifyunder penalty of perjury that he or she hasa religious objection to the entity provid-ing the coverage. The Departments be-lieve that either requirement would be un-duly restrictive, and would unnecessarilyinterfere with for-prot entities' decision-making processes. Instead, these nal reg-ulations provide that the organization'shighest governing body (such as its boardof directors, board of trustees, or owners,if managed directly by the owners) mustadopt a resolution (or take other similaraction consistent with the organization'sapplicable rules of governance and withstate law) establishing that the organiza-tion objects to covering some or all of thecontraceptive services on account of itsowners' sincerely held religious beliefs. (c)Documentation of the decision to assert a religious objection tocontraceptive coverage . In the August 2014 proposed regula- tions, the Departments sought commentson whether a for-prot entity seeking theaccommodation should be required todocument its decision-making process forobjecting to coverage for some or all con-traceptive services on account of religiousobjections (as opposed to merely disclos-ing the fact that it made such a decision).Many comments supported a requirementthat the decision-making process be doc-umented, and that the entity submit, to itsthird party administrator or health insur-ance issuer, as applicable, and to the fed-eral government, documentation of the en-tity's decision. These nal regulationsrequire that a for-prot entity seeking theaccommodation must make the decisionpursuant to a resolution (or other similaraction), as described above. However, theDepartments are not requiring that thisresolution be provided as a matter ofcourse to the federal government or anyother party. Generally, the Departmentsbelieve it is sufcient that the fact of thedecision itself, as opposed to documenta- tion of the decision, be communicated asset forth in August 2014 interim nal reg-ulations and these nal regulations. How-ever, with respect to documentation of thedecision, record retention requirementsunder section 107 of ERISA apply di-rectly to ERISA-covered plans and, withrespect to other plans or coverage subjectto these nal regulations, by operation ofthese nal regulations, which incorporatethe record retention requirements underERISA section 107 by reference. This ap-proach is consistent with document stan-dards for nonprot entities seeking theaccommodation. (d)Disclosure of the decision to assert a religious objection to contraceptiveservices. In the August 2014 proposed regula- tions, the Departments sought commentson whether a for-prot entity seeking theaccommodation should be required to dis-close publicly or to its employees its de-cision not to cover some or all contracep-tive services on account of religiousobjections. This requirement would be inaddition to the requirement that an eligibleorganization that is a for-prot entity thatseeks the accommodation make its self-certication or notice of objection to pro-viding contraceptive coverage on accountof religious objections available for ex- amination upon request by the rst dayof the plan year to which the accommo-dation applies, and be maintained in amanner consistent with the record reten-tion requirements under section 107 ofERISA. Many commenters suggested that the entity should be required to notify HHS ofits decision to object (even if it chooses toself-certify and send the self-certicationto its issuer or third party administrator).A few commenters stated that all employ-ees and prospective employees (or studentenrollees and their covered dependents)must be made aware of their employer's(or educational institution's) refusal to of-fer contraceptive coverage. One com-menter stated that a closely held for-protentity should disclose the following to itsshareholders and employees: (A) the rea- 34SeeEBSA Form 700. Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 109sons the decision was made, (B) the changes that will take place as a result ofthe decision, and (C) the number of peoplethat will be affected by the decision. An-other commenter stated that entities avail-ing themselves of the accommodationshould be required to publicize their jus-tications for denying women access tocoverage of medications that serve pur-poses other than contraception. One com-menter noted the need of employees toknow by the employer's annual open en-rollment period whether the employer isavailing itself of the accommodation. These nal regulations do not establish any additional requirements to disclosethe decision. The Departments believethat the current notice and disclosure stan-dards afford individuals eligible for or en-rolled in group health plans (and studentseligible for or enrolled in student healthinsurance) with an accommodation ade-quate opportunity to know that the em-ployer (or educational institution) haselected the accommodation for its grouphealth plan (or insurance coverage), andthat they are entitled to separate paymentfor contraceptive services from anothersource without cost sharing. Those stan-dards require that, for each plan year towhich the accommodation applies, a thirdparty administrator that is required to pro-vide or arrange payments for contracep-tive services, and a health insurance issuerrequired to provide payment for these ser-vices, provide to plan participants andbeneciaries (or student enrollees andtheir covered dependents) written noticeof the availability of separate paymentsfor these services contemporaneous with(to the extent possible), but separate from,any application materials distributed inconnection with enrollment or re-enrollment in health coverage. Model lan-guage for this notice is provided in theregulations. (e)Sincerity of the owners' religious beliefs . Many commenters suggested that, for a closely held for-prot entity to be eligiblefor an accommodation, it should not besufcient that the entity's owners object toproviding contraceptive coverage. Rather,the commenters proposed that owners should also be required to agree to operatethe entity in a manner consistent with re-ligious principles, and in fact to so operatethe entity. Some commenters pointed outthat the July 2013 nal regulations requirenon-prot religious organizations thatavail themselves of the accommodation to\"hold themselves out\" as religious organi-zations. The Departments have not adopted such a criterion for for-prot entities. TheSupreme Court's decision in Hobby Lobby discussed the application of RFRA in connection with the religious beliefs ofthe owners of a closely held corporation. 35 These nal regulations similarly focus onthe religious exercise of the owners of theclosely held entity and provide that theentity, in advancing the religious objec-tion, represent that it does so on the basisof the religious beliefs of the owners. TheDepartments do not believe it is also nec-essary that the entity itself demonstrate byits bylaws, mission statement, or otherdocuments or practices that it has a reli-gious character. Non-prot entities ordi-narily do not have owners in the same wayas do for-prot entities, and thus the reli-gious character of a non-prot entitywould be reflected in how it holds itselfout. (f)Other steps the Departments should take to ensure contraceptive coveragewith no cost sharing . The August 2014 proposed regulations solicited comments on other steps the De-partments should take to help ensure thatparticipants and beneciaries (in the caseof student health insurance coverage, en-rollees and dependents) in plans subject toan accommodation are able to obtain,without cost, the full range of FDA-approved contraceptives without costsharing. Many commenters stated that agovernment enforcement body should beestablished to monitor compliance by plansponsors, third party administrators, andhealth insurance issuers, of their respec-tive obligations associated with the ac-commodation. At this time, the Depart-ments do not believe that an independentbody need be established, although asstated above, the Departments will use their established oversight processes, ap-plicable to all the Affordable Care Actmarket reforms of title XXVII of the PHSAct to monitor compliance with the re-quirement to provide contraceptive ser-vices without cost sharing. As part ofthose processes, the Departments willwork with non-compliant parties to bringthem into compliance, and will take en-forcement action as appropriate. Other commenters stated that the fed- eral government should ensure that nobarriers to contraceptive coverage existdue to an enrollee's cultural background,English prociency, disability, or sexualorientation. The Departments agree thatno barriers should exist. The same federaland applicable state laws that would pro-hibit discrimination by employers, grouphealth plans, third party administrators,and health insurance issuers generallywould also apply with respect to the enti-ties arranging for or providing separatepayments for contraceptive services forwomen in group health plans and studenthealth insurance subject to an accommo-dation. Other commenters urged that the sep- arate payments for contraceptive servicesbe provided in the same manner in whichthe group health plan or student healthinsurance would have otherwise coveredthese services had they not had an accom-modation, or in the same manner in whichthe plan or coverage subject to an accom-modation covers other, non-contraceptivebenets. The Departments, however,maintain the view that reasonable differ-ences in the way services are paid for orprovided would not necessarily be inap-propriate, provided those differences donot create barriers to accessing paymentsfor contraceptive services. Another com-menter stated that health insurance issuersof plans subject to an accommodationshould not be permitted to require enroll-ees to have two insurance cards, one forcontraceptive benets, and one for otherbenets. The Departments do not believethat this practice, in of itself, would con-stitute a barrier to accessing separate pay-ments for contraceptive services. 35See134 S. Ct. at 2768. August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 110(g)Other comments that relate to the July 2013 nal regulations. In the August 2014 proposed regula- tions and interim nal regulations, the De-partments sought comment on other po-tential changes to the July 2013 nalregulations in light of the proposedchange to the denition of eligible orga-nization. In particular, the Departmentssought comment on applying the approachset forth in the July 2013 nal regulationsin the context of the expanded denitionof eligible organization. The July 2013nal regulations provide for separate pay-ments for contraceptive services for par-ticipants and beneciaries in self-insuredgroup health plans of eligible organiza-tions in a manner that enables these orga-nizations to completely separate them-selves from administration and paymentfor contraceptive coverage. Specically,the third party administrator must provideor arrange the payments, and the thirdparty administrator can seek reimburse-ment for the costs (including an allowancefor administrative costs and margin) bymaking an arrangement with a participat-ing issuer - that is, an issuer offeringcoverage through a Federally-facilitatedExchange (FFE). The participating issuercan receive an adjustment to its FFE userfees to nance these costs. One commenter suggested that the fed- eral government set up a program to dis-pense these services using contractors.Another commenter suggested that phar-maceutical companies could provide cer-tain contraceptives directly by mail to per-sons who are told at a dispensingpharmacy that their plan has denied cov-erage. Additionally, the pharmaceuticalcompanies could directly supply doctorswho prescribe birth control, who in turncould dispense directly to patients who arenot covered under their employer- sponsored group health plan or studenthealth insurance coverage. One com-menter suggested making contraceptionavailable for any woman free of chargethrough a doctor. One commenter sug-gested providing contraceptive carethrough Medicaid. The Departments have not adopted the proposals advanced by these commentsfor two reasons. First, the Departments donot have the legal authority to requirepharmaceutical companies or doctors to provide contraceptives directly, nor dothey have the authority to implement theother alternative arrangements proposedby these commenters. Second, these alter-natives raise obstacles to access to seam-less coverage. Consistent with the statu-tory objective of promoting access tocontraceptive coverage and other preven-tive services without cost sharing, planbeneciaries and enrollees should not berequired to incur additional costs - nan-cial or otherwise - to receive access andthus should not be required to enroll innew programs or to surmount other hur-dles to receive access to coverage. TheDepartments believe that the third partyadministrators and health insurance issu-ers already paying for other medical andpharmacy services on behalf of thewomen seeking the contraceptive servicesare better placed to provide seamless cov-erage of the contraceptive services, thanare other providers that may not be in theinsurance coverage network, and that lackthe coverage administration infrastructureto verify the identity of women in accom-modated health plans and provide format-ted claims data for government reimburse-ment. Some commenters suggested other changes to the July 2013 regulations, withrespect to how separate payments for con-traceptive services provided under the ac-commodation are funded. One commenterexpressed concern that the August 2014proposed regulations are silent as to pos-sible funds for reimbursement of costsincurred for contraception services wherethere is no FFE operating in the state. Thiscommenter also noted that the regulationsdo not consider the possibility that thecost for contraceptive services may ex-ceed the issuer's FFE user fee, nor do theyaddress how a third party administrator would be reimbursed if the issuer is nolonger a participating issuer in the FFE.The commenter suggested the Depart-ments consider several different nancingoptions: the user fee for the risk adjust-ment program; the CMS program man-agement fund; the user fee for the Medi-care Part D program; the Prevention andPublic Health Fund; medical loss ratiorebates; CMS innovation funding; and thehealth insurance provider fee.Another commenter recommended that HHS provide for an expedited process ofadjusting FFE user fees in case the vol-ume of contraceptive claims is greaterthan expected. This commenter also sug-gested that the Departments also consideralternative means of generating fundingfor this purpose, such as allowing an is-suer to charge a premium of at least anamount equal to the pro rata share of therate the eligible organization would havepaid had it not elected the accommoda-tion, or directly subsidize the cost of con-traception using funding provided by thePrevention and Public Health Fund. One commenter stated that the Depart- ments should evaluate the limitations ofcurrent funding arrangements with respectto the current accommodation for eligiblenon-prot entities, given the additionaldemands of the proposal to expand theaccommodation to certain for-prot enti-ties. The commenter suggested allowing aseparate government funded reimburse-ment mechanism for enrollees in both in- sured and self-funded plans as an alterna-tive approach to funding the program. Ifthe current funding approach is continued,the commenter recommended a reassess-ment of the limitations of the approach forthird party administrators. If third partyadministrators remain responsible for pro-viding or arranging separate payments forcontraceptive services, the commenterrecommended a broadening of the poolavailable for reimbursement beyond indi-vidually negotiated arrangements with is-suers participating in the FFE, includingpotentially establishing a single pool forreimbursement or nding an alternative,simpler nancing mechanism for thirdparty administrators, including offsetsfrom federal income taxes, and offsets toamounts due from other lines of businessoperated by the third party administrator. At this time, the Departments are not adopting an alternative approach to fund-ing separate payments for contraceptiveservices with respect to costs incurred forwomen in plans subject to an accommo-dation, although the Departments willcontinue to explore the feasibility of dif-ferent ideas, including those proposed inthe comments. One commenter suggested that issuers should be permitted to treat the cost ofproviding separate payments for contra- Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 111ceptive services for women in plans sub- ject to an accommodation as an adjust-ment to claims costs for purposes ofcalculating their medical loss ratios, whilestill being allowed to treat such paymentsas an administrative cost spread across theissuer's entire risk pool. 36With respect to calculating medical loss ratios, HHS haspreviously stated in rulemaking that aninsurer of an accommodated insuredgroup health or student plan may includethe cost of the actual payments it makesfor contraceptive services in the numera-tor of its medical loss ratio. 37 Several commenters asked whether, in light of the fact that the accommodationwas proposed to be expanded to a new setof entities, if the Department's discussionin the preamble to the July 2013 nalregulations about the extent to which theaccommodation has an effect on otherlaws, continues to apply. 38The Depart- ments explained in that discussion thatstate insurance laws that provide greateraccess to contraceptive coverage than fed-eral standards are unlikely to be pre-empted, and that, in states with broaderreligious exemptions and accommoda-tions with respect to health insurance is-suers than those in the regulations, plansare still required to comply with the fed-eral standard. These principles continue toapply. One commenter stated that the Hobby Lobby decision applies to every form of medical care, not just contraception, andthat the regulations should reflect that.However, in Hobby Lobby, the Court stated: In any event, our decision in these cases is concerned solely with thecontraceptive mandate. Our deci-sion should not be understood tohold that an insurance-coveragemandate must necessarily fail if itconflicts with an employer's reli-gious beliefs. Other coverage re-quirements, such as immunizations,may be supported by different inter-ests (for example, the need to com-bat the spread of infectious dis-eases) and may involve differentarguments about the least restrictive means of providing them. 39 Regarding fully insured plans, one commenter noted that the July 2013 nalregulations permit issuers that are provid-ing separate payments for contraceptiveservices under the accommodation, to payfor all FDA-approved contraceptive ser-vices, or only for those services to whichthe eligible organization objects to cover-ing on religious grounds. The commenternoted that this approach simplies the op-erational issues associated with imple- menting the accommodation across multi-ple employers, and sought claricationthat this approach is available to thirdparty administrators as well. The Depart-ments clarify that this option is availableto third party administrators with respectto self-insured plans. One commenter requested that notices of objection to covering contraceptive ser-vices on religious grounds be providedwith at least 60 days' advance notice, andthat any change in objection status basedon change of ownership of the employernot be implemented until the next planyear or policy year. The Departments donot adopt this suggestion. Instead, the De-partments are extending, to closely heldfor-prot entities, the same timeframesthat have been in effect for non-prot el-igible organizations, that is, a plan spon-sor can provide such notice, and imple-ment plan benet changes associated withthe accommodation, at any time. Forgroup health plans subject to ERISA, ex-isting notice and timeframe requirementsunder ERISA apply. Another commenter stated that health insurance issuers and third party adminis-trators should only be required to provideor arrange for separate payments for con-traceptive services for eligible organiza-tions that have invoked an accommoda-tion no earlier than the rst day of the rstplan year that follows publication of thesenal regulations. To provide employers,institutions of higher education, thirdparty administrators, and health insuranceissuers adequate time to comply, thesenal regulations apply beginning on the rst day of the rst plan year (or, in theindividual market, the rst policy year)after these regulations are effective. Ac-cordingly these nal regulations are effec-tive beginning on the rst day of the rstplan year (or, in the individual market, therst policy year) that begins on or afterSeptember 14, 2015. Several commenters stated that the de- cision to not cover some or all contracep-tives on religious grounds should be madeannually. The Departments do not believesuch a requirement is appropriate or nec-essary. One commenter asked for clarication as to how a notice of objection would beprovided by employers purchasing cover-age through the Small Business HealthOptions Program (SHOP) and whetherthere will be a mechanism in place thatpermits an eligible organization to select asmall group plan and provide a notice ofobjection. With respect to employers pur-chasing coverage through the SHOP,health insurance issuers selling policiesthrough it, and participants and benecia-ries in such plans, all of the rights andobligations that are associated with theseregulations apply no differently than if theemployer were to purchase coverage out-side of the SHOP. One commenter stated that providing separate payments for contraceptive ser-vices is not cost-neutral for an issuer, andthat it is not appropriate for an issuer of astudent health insurance plan to be requiredto make separate payments for contracep-tive services for enrollees in student healthplans subject to an accommodation, andsuggested that the Marketplaces should in-stead offer free individual market policiescovering contraception to those who desiresuch coverage, or that such individuals getsuch services through existing clinics. In the alternative, the commenter proposed an\"above the line\" deduction on their federalincome taxes for all costs incurred for sep-arate payments made for contraceptive ser-vices for enrollees in a student health plansubject to an accommodation. The Depart-ments do not adopt the comment. For the 36SeeDiscussion of how an issuer may achieve cost neutrality in the preamble to the July 2013 nal regulations, at 78 FR 39878. 37SeePatient Protection and Affordable Care Act; HHS Notice of Benet and Payment Parameters for 2015 (Mar. 11, 2014), at 79 FR 13809. 3878 FR 39888. 39134 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 112reasons stated in the July 2013 nal regula- tions, the Departments believe that coveringcontraceptive services is cost-neutral for anissuer at risk for the enrollees in a plansubject to an accommodation. With respectto student health insurance plans, these reg-ulations nalize a clarication proposed inthe August 2014 proposed regulations underwhich a reference to the denition of \"insti-tution of higher education\" found in 20U.S.C. 1002 is added to 45 CFR 147.131(f),to clarify that both nonprot and closelyheld for-prot institutions of higher educa-tion, with respect to their insured studenthealth plans, may qualify as eligible organi-zations. III. Economic Impact and Paperwork Burden A.Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 - Department of Health and HumanServices and Department of Labor. Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735) directs agencies to assess all costs andbenets of available regulatory alterna-tives and, if regulation is necessary, toselect regulatory approaches that maximizenet benets (including potential economic,environmental, public health and safety Order 13563 January21, 2011) is supplemental to and reafrmsthe principles, structures, and denitionsgoverning regulatory review as establishedin Executive Order 12866. Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 denes a \"signicant regulatory action\" asan action that is likely to result in a pro-posed rule\u2014(1) having an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or morein any one year, or adversely and materi-ally affecting a sector of the economy,productivity, competition, jobs, the envi-ronment, public health or safety, or state,local or tribal governments or communities(also referred to as \"economically signi-cant\"); (2) creating a serious inconsistencyor otherwise interfering with an action takenor planned by another agency; (3) materiallyaltering the budgetary impacts of entitle-ment grants, user fees, or loan programs orthe rights and obligations of recipients there- of; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issuesarising out of legal mandates, the Presi-dent's priorities, or the principles set forth inthe Executive Order. A regulatory impact analysis (RIA) must be prepared for major rules witheconomically signicant effects ($100million or more in any 1 year), and a\"signicant\" regulatory action is subjectto review by the Ofce of Managementand Budget (OMB). As discussed below,the Departments anticipate that these reg-ulations - most notably the policies rst established in the 2010 interim nal rule -are likely to have economic impacts of $100 million or more in any one year, andtherefore meet the denition of \"signicantrule\" under Executive Order 12866. There-fore, the Departments have provided an as-sessment of the potential costs, benets, andtransfers associated with these nal regula-tions. In accordance with the provisions ofExecutive Order 12866, these nal regula-tions were reviewed by the OMB. 1.Need for Regulatory Action These nal regulations nalize the July 2010 interim nal regulations related tocoverage of recommended preventive ser-vices, the August 2014 interim nal reg-ulations related to the process an eligibleorganization uses to provide notice of itsreligious objections to the coverage ofcontraceptive services, and the August2014 proposed regulations related to thedenition of eligible organization. As discussed later in the RIA, histori- cally there has been an underutilization ofpreventive services, as health insuranceissuers have had little incentive to coverthese services. Currently, there is still anunderutilization of some preventive ser-vices due to a number of barriers, includ-ing costs, ethnic/gender disparities 40, and a general lack of knowledge by those withmedical coverage. 41While many of these factors are being addressed through theAffordable Care Act and these nal regu-lations, the current underutilization of pre-ventive services stems from three mainfactors. First, due to turnover in the health insurance market, health insurance issuershave historically lacked incentives tocover preventive services, whose benetsmay only be realized in the future when anindividual may no longer be enrolled withthat issuer. Second, many preventive ser- vices generate benets that do not accrueimmediately to the individual that re-ceives the services, making the individualless likely to avail themselves of the ser-vices, especially in the face of direct, im-mediate costs. Third, some of the benetsof preventive services accrue to society asa whole, and thus do not get factored intoan individual's decision making overwhether to obtain such services. The July 2010 interim nal regulations and these nal regulations address thesemarket failures through two avenues.First, the regulations require coverage ofrecommended preventive services by non-grandfathered group health plans andhealth insurance issuers in the group andindividual markets, thereby overcomingplans' lack of incentive to invest in theseservices. Second, the regulations elimi-nate cost-sharing requirements, therebyremoving a barrier that could otherwiselead an individual to not obtain such ser-vices, given the long-term and partiallyexternal nature of these benets. The August 2014 interim nal regula- tions provided an alternate process thateligible organizations can use to providenotice of their religious objections to pro-viding coverage for some or all of thecontraceptive services to HHS, instead ofproviding the EBSA Form 700 to the is-suers or third party administrators of theirgroup health plan. The provisions of thoseinterim nal regulations are being nal-ized without any changes. These nal regulations also amend the denition of an eligible organization toinclude a closely held for-prot entity thathas a religious objection to providing cov-erage for some or all of the contraceptiveservices otherwise required to be coveredby the group health plan or student healthinsurance plan established, maintained, orarranged by the organization. 40Call, K.

Health Affairs, 31 (12), 2641-2648. Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 113These nal regulations are necessary in order to provide rules that plan sponsorsand issuers can continue to use to deter-mine how to provide coverage for certainrecommended preventive services withoutthe imposition of cost sharing, to ensurewomen's ability to receive those services,and to respect the religious beliefs of qual-ifying eligible organizations with respectto their objection to covering contracep-tive services.2.Summary of Impacts In accordance with OMB Circular A-4, Table III.1 below depicts an ac-counting statement summarizing the De-partments' assessment of the benets,costs, and transfers associated with thisregulatory action. It is expected that allnon-grandfathered plans are already com- plying with the provisions of the July2010 and August 2014 interim nal regu-lations. Therefore, benets related to those regulations have been experiencedand costs have already been incurred. TheDepartments are providing an assessmentof the impacts of existing provisions al-ready experienced and expected in the fu-ture, in addition to the anticipated impactsof new provisions in these nal regula-tions. Table III.1: Accounting Table Benets: Qualitative: * Increased access to and utilization of recommended preventive services, leading to the following benets:(1) prevention and reduction in transmission of illnesses as a result of immunization and screening of transmissible diseases; (2) delayed onset, earlier treatment, and reduction in morbidity and mortality as a result of early detection, screening, and counseling; (3) increased productivity and reduced absenteeism; and(4) savings from lower health care costs.* Benets to eligible for-prot entities from not being required to facilitate access to or pay for services that contradict their owners' religious beliefs. Costs: Qualitative: * New costs to the health care system when individuals increase their use of preventive services in response to the changes in coverage and cost-sharing requirements of preventive services. The magnitude of this effect on utilization de-pends on the price elasticity of demand and the percentage change in prices facing those with reduced cost sharing ornewly gaining coverage. * Administrative cost to eligible for-prot entities to provide self-certication to issuers or third party administrators or notice to HHS. * Administrative cost to issuers and third party administrators for plans sponsored by eligible closely held for-prot enti- ties to provide notice to enrollees. Transfers: * Costs previously paid out-of-pocket for certain preventive services are now covered by group health plans and issuers. * Risk pooling in the group market will result in sharing expected cost increases across an entire plan or employee group as higher average premiums for all enrollee. However, not all of those covered will utilize preventive services to an equiv-alent extent. As a result, these nal regulations create a small transfer from those paying premiums in the group marketutilizing less than the average volume of preventive services in their risk pool to those whose utilization is greater thanaverage. To the extent there is risk pooling in the individual market, a similar transfer will occur. * Transfer of costs related to certain preventive services from eligible self-funded closely held for-prot entities to third party administrators and issuers that provide (or arrange) separate payments for contraceptive services. Third party admin-istrators can make arrangements with an issuer offering coverage through an FFE to obtain reimbursement for its costs,and the issuer offering coverage through the FFE can receive an adjustment to the FFE user fee. 3.Estimated number of Affected Entities For purposes of this analysis, the De- partments have dened a large grouphealth plan as an employer plan with 100or more workers and a small group plan as an employer plan with less than 100 work-ers. The Departments estimate that thereare approximately 140,000 large and 2.2million small ERISA-covered grouphealth plans with an estimated 93.2 mil- lion participants in large group plans and36 million participants in small groupplans. The Departments estimate thatthere are approximately 128,000 govern- August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 114mental plans with 39 million participants in large plans and 2.8 million participantsin small plans. 42In 2013, approximately 12.26 million participants were coveredby individual health insurance policies. 43 Group health plans and health insur- ance issuers offering group and individualhealth insurance coverage that are notgrandfathered health plans will be af-fected by these regulations. There are anestimated 500 issuers offering group andindividual health insurance coverage. 44 The number of employer-sponsoredgrandfathered plans has been decreasingsteadily since 2010. Thirty-seven percentof employers offering health benets of-fered at least one grandfathered healthplan in 2014, compared to 54 percent in2013 and 72 percent in 2011. Therefore,more and more enrollees in employer-sponsored plans have gained access topreventive services without cost sharing.Twenty-six percent of covered workerswere enrolled in a grandfathered healthplan in 2014, as compared to 36 percent in2013 and 56 percent in 2011. 45In the individual market, it is expected that alarge proportion of individual policies arenot grandfathered. In addition, enrolleesin qualied health plans purchasedthrough the Marketplaces have non-grandfathered policies. At the end of thesecond enrollment period, nearly 11.7million individuals selected or were auto-matically reenrolled into a 2015 healthinsurance plan through the Market-places. 46 It is uncertain how many closely held for-prot entities have religious objec-tions to providing coverage for some or allof the contraceptive services otherwise re- quired to be covered. Based on litigationand communication received by HHS, theDepartments estimate that at least 87closely held for-prot eligible organiza-tions will seek the religious accommoda-tion provided in these nal regulations.Health insurance issuers (or third partyadministrators for self-insured plans) forthe group health plans established ormaintained by these eligible organizations(and health insurance issuers of closelyheld for-prot institutions of higher edu-cation) will assume sole responsibility forproviding (or arranging) separate pay-ments for contraceptive services directlyfor plan participants and beneciaries(and for student enrollees and depen-dents), without cost sharing, premium,fee, or other charge to plan participants orbeneciaries (or student enrollees and de-pendents) or to the eligible organization orits plan. In addition, based on litigation,the Departments estimate that at least 122non-prot eligible organizations will havethe option to provide notice of their reli-gious objections to HHS, instead of pro-viding the EBSA Form 700 to the issueror third party administrator of their grouphealth plan. These numbers are likely tounderestimate the number of eligible or-ganizations that will seek the accommo-dation. However, these are the best esti-mates available to the Departments at thistime. 4.Benets In the July 2010 interim nal regula- tions, the Departments anticipated severaltypes of benets that will result from ex- panding coverage and eliminating costsharing for recommended preventive ser-vices. First, individuals will experienceimproved health as a result of reducedtransmission, prevention or delayed onset,and earlier treatment of disease. Second,healthier workers and children will bemore productive with fewer missed daysof work or school. Third, some of therecommended preventive services will re-sult in savings due to lower health carecosts. As stated in the July 2010 interim nal regulations, preventive service coverage islimited to those recommended by the TaskForce (grade of A or B), an applicableAdvisory Committee, and HRSA. 47These nal regulations can be expected to con-tinue to increase access to and utilizationof these services, which have been histor-ically underutilized. For example, 27.7percent of adults aged 50 to 75 have neverbeen screened for colorectal cancer (suchas sigmoidoscopy and/or colonoscopy). 48 In 2012, the median percentage of women over the age of 18 that have not had a paptest in the past 3 years was 22 percent. 49 The CDC recently found that in adultsover 50, fewer than 30 percent are up-to-date with core preventive services. 50 As explained in the July 2010 interim nal regulations, numerous studies haveshown that improved coverage, or reducedcosts, of preventive services results inhigher utilization of these services 51lead- ing to potentially substantial benets.

The National Council on Pre-ventive Priorities (NCPP) has estimatedthat achieving a utilization rate of 90 per-cent for eight clinical preventive serviceswould save more than 150,000 lives eachyear in the U.S., including 42,000 ifsmokers were offered medication or othercessation assistance (Table III.2). 52Froman economic viewpoint, many preventive services offer high economic value53re- sulting in an estimated savings of $3.7billion. 54Even if a rate of 90 percent utilization is not achieved due to a varietyof barriers, including nancial, service ac-cessibility, and socioeconomic disparities,the Departments expect that utilizationwill increase among those individuals inplans subject to the regulations because the provisions eliminate cost sharing andrequire coverage for these services. It isexpected that the increased utilization ofthese services will lead providers to in-crease their use of these services knowingthat they will be covered without costsharing.

The Departments expect that uti-lization of preventive services will con-tinue to increase over time among thoseindividuals in plans affected by these reg-ulations because the provisions eliminate cost sharing and require coverage forthese services. Some recommended preventive ser- vices have both individual and publichealth value. Vaccines have reduced oreliminated serious diseases that, prior tovaccination, routinely caused serious ill-nesses or deaths. Maintaining high levelsof immunization in the general population protects the un-immunized from exposureso that individuals who cannot receive, orwho do not have a sufcient immune re-sponse to the vaccine, are indirectly pro-tected. 58 A second type of benet of these nal regulations is improved workplace pro-ductivity and decreased absenteeism forschool children. A study by Gallup has found that among workers working atleast 30 hours a week, those consideredoverweight or obese with one or morechronic condition will miss one to 3.5 52National Commission on Prevention Priorities.

Recentdata indicates that in the 2011-2012 aca-demic year, 6.2 percent of children aged 6through 17 missed 11 or more days ofschool. 61Studies have shown that student health and well-being have been posi-tively linked to students' academic out-comes, including attendance, grades, testscores, and high school graduation. 62As discussed in the July 2010 interim nalrules, studies show that reduced cost shar-ing and increased access to care can im-prove productivity in both schools and thelabor market. Thus, it is expected thatthese nal regulations can have a substan-tial benet to the children in the nation'seducation system and the labor market,both current and future. A third type of benet from some pre- ventive services is cost savings. Increas-ing the provision of preventive services isexpected to reduce the incidence or sever-ity of illness, and, as a result, reduce ex-penditures on treatment of illness. As dis-cussed in the July 2010 interim nalregulations and elsewhere, 63childhood vaccinations have been found to generateconsiderable benet and savings to bothindividuals and society. Employing a de-cision analysis cohort model of U.S. chil-dren born during 1994-2013, researchersat CDC analyzed the economic impact of DTaP (diphtheria and tetanus toxoids andacellular Pertussis), Hib ( in aged /H113496 years. The study estimates that among the78.6 million children born during this pe-riod, these routine immunizations willprevent 322 million illnesses and 21 mil-lion hospitalizations, averting 732,000premature deaths over their lifetime. Fur-thermore, it was estimated that these rou-tine vaccinations will potentially avert$402 billion in direct costs and $1.5 tril-lion in societal costs and a net savings of$295 billion and $1.38 trillion for payersand society, respectively (in 2013 dol-lars). 64 As with immunizations, other preven- tive services have been estimated to havecost-savings benets. As discussed in theJuly 2010 interim nal regulations, aspirinuse with high risk adults and tobacco ces-sation and screening can both yield netsavings. For example, in Massachusetts, the availability of tobacco cessation treat-ments combined with promotional cam-paigns resulted in a ten percent decline inMedicaid enrolled smokers, a $3.12 sav-ings for every dollar spent on the bene-t. 65As discussed in more detail in the July 2010 interim nal regulations, an-other area where prevention can achievesavings is obesity prevention and reduc-tion. Based on recent guidelines, up to116.1 million American adults are candi-dates for both pharmaceutical and behav-ioral treatments for weight loss, and up to 32 million are eligible for bariatric sur-gery. 66According to the CDC, from 2011-2012, 16.9 percent of children 2through 19 years of age and 34.9 percentof adults aged 20 and over were obese(dened as having a body mass index(BMI) greater than or equal to the age andsex-specic 95 thpercentiles of the 200 CDC growth charts).67One study used the number of obese and overweight twelve-year olds in 2005 to simulate a cohort overtheir lifetimes, indicating that a sustainedone-percentage-point decrease in theprevalence of obesity over the lifetime ofthis cohort would result in an estimatedsavings of $260.4 million in total medicalexpenditures. 68These nal regulations are expected to increase the take-up rate ofpreventative services counseling for obe-sity and other conditions among patients,and lead physicians to increase appropri-ate referrals for such services. The effectof these nal regulations is expected to bemagnied due to the numerous public andprivate sector initiatives dedicated to com-bating the obesity epidemic and smokingcessation. Eligible closely held for-prot entities that seek the accommodation to excludecoverage for contraceptive services fromhealth coverage offered to their employ-ees and students, and eligible organiza-tions that opt to provide notice to HHS,will benet from not being required tofacilitate access to or pay for coveragethat are contrary to their owners' religiousbeliefs.

Newcosts to the health system result whenindividuals increase their use of preven-tive services in response to the changes incoverage of those services. Cost sharing,including coinsurance, deductibles, andcopayments, divides the costs of healthservices between the plan or issuer and theenrollees. The removal of cost sharingincreases the quantity of services de-manded by lowering the direct cost of theservice to consumers. Therefore, the De-partments expect that the statute and thesenal regulations will continue to increaseutilization of the covered preventive ser-vices. The magnitude of this effect onutilization depends on the price elasticityof demand. Several studies have found that indi- viduals are sensitive to prices for healthservices. 69CDC researchers who studied out-of pocket costs of immunizations forprivately insured children up to age 5 (infamilies in Georgia in 2003) found that a one percent increase in out-of-pocketcosts for routine immunizations (DTaP,IPV, MMR, Hib, and Hep B) was associ-ated with a 0.07 percent decrease in utili-zation. 70 Eligible closely held for-prot entities that seek the accommodation for contra-ceptive services will incur administrativecosts to provide self-certications to issu-ers or third party administrators or noticesto HHS. Issuers and third party adminis-trators for health plans sponsored by theseeligible organizations will also incur ad-ministrative costs to provide notications to enrollees. The costs related to theseinformation collection requirements areestimated in section D below. Along with new costs of induced utili- zation, there are transfers associated withthese nal regulations. A transfer is achange in who pays for the services,where there is not an actual change in thelevel of resources used. For example,costs that were previously paid out-of-pocket for certain preventive services willnow be covered by plans and issuers un-der these nal regulations. Such a transferof costs could be expected to lead to anincrease in premiums. In the July 2010 interim nal regula- tions, the Departments analyzed the im-pact of eliminating cost sharing, increasesin services covered, and induced utiliza-tion on the average insurance premiumusing a model to evaluate private healthinsurance plans against a nationally repre-sentative population. In the July 2010 in-terim nal regulations, the Departmentsanalyzed Medical Expenditure Panel Sur-vey (MEPS) data and determined the av-erage person with employer-sponsored in-surance (ESI) would have $264 in coveredpreventive service expenses, of which$240 would be paid by insurance and $24paid out-of-pocket. 71When preventive services are covered with zero copayment,the Departments estimated the averagepreventive benet (holding utilizationconstant) would increase by $24, or a 0.6percent increase in insurance benets andpremiums for plans that have relinquishedtheir grandfather status. Furthermore, inthe July 2010 interim nal regulations, theDepartments estimated that additionalcoverage for genetic screening, depressionscreening, lead testing, autism testing, andoral health screening would result in a total average increase in insurance bene-ts on these services to be 0.12 percent, orjust over $4 per insured person. This in-crease represented a mixture of new costsand transfers, dependent on whether ben- eciaries previously purchased these ser-vices on their own. Impacts were expectedto vary depending on baseline benet lev-els, and grandfathered health plans werenot expected to experience any impactfrom those interim nal regulations. As discussed in the July 2010 interim nal regulations, the Departments usedthe standard actuarial \"induction formula\"1/(1/H11001alpha*P), where alpha is the \"induc- tion parameter\" and P is the average frac-tion of the cost of services paid by con-sumers to estimate behavioral changes toestimate the induced demand for preven-tive services. 72Removing cost sharing for preventive services lowers the direct costto consumers of using preventive services,which induces additional utilization, esti-mated with the model above to increasecovered expenses and benets by approx-imately $17, or 0.44 percent in insurancebenets in group health plans. A similar,but larger, effect was anticipated in theindividual market because individualhealth insurance policies generally hadless generous benets for preventive ser-vices than group health plans. When eligible closely held for-prot entities seek the accommodation, healthinsurance issuers (or third party adminis-trators for self-insured plans) for thegroup health plans established or main-tained by the eligible organizations (andhealth insurance issuers of student healthplans arranged by eligible organizationsthat are institutions of higher education)will assume sole responsibility for provid-ing (or arranging) separate payments forcontraceptive services directly for planparticipants and beneciaries (or studentenrollees and dependents), without costsharing, premium, fee, or other charge toplan participants or beneciaries (or stu- dent enrollees and dependents) or to theeligible organization or its plan. The De-partments continue to believe that issuerswill nd that providing contraceptive cov- 69Liu, S., and Chollet, D., Price and Income Elasticity of the Demand for Health Insurance and Health Care Services: A Critical Review of the Literature, Mathematica Policy Research Inc., (March 2006) http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/ /H11011/media/publications/PDFs/priceincome.pdf Hosek, SD., Vollaard, BA., and Mahnovski (2002), The elasticity of demand for health care; A review of the literature and its application to the military health system, National Defense Research Institute, RAND Hea lth.http://www.rand.org/content/ dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/2005/MR1355.pdf . 70Seee.g., Noelle-Angelique Molinari et al., \"Out-of-Pocket Costs Childhood Immunizations: A Comparison by Type of Insurance Plan,\" Pediatrics, 120 (5) pp. e1148-e1156 (2007). 71The model does not distinguish between recommended and non-recommended preventive services, and so this likely represents an overestimate of the in surance benets for preventive services. 72Standard formula best described in \"Quantity- Price Relationships in Health Insurance\", Charles L Trowbridge, Chief Actuary, Social Security Admi nistration (DHEW Publication No. (SSA) 73- 11507, November 1972). August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 118erage is at least cost neutral because they will be insuring the same set of individu-als under both the group or student healthinsurance policies for whom they will alsobe making the separate payments for con-traceptive services and, as a result, willexperience lower costs from improve-ments in women's health, healthier timingand spacing of pregnancies, and fewerunplanned pregnancies. Several studieshave estimated that the costs of providingcontraceptive coverage are balanced bycost savings from lower pregnancy-related costs and from improvements inwomen's health. 73A third party adminis- trator can make arrangements with an is-suer offering coverage through an FFE toobtain reimbursement for its costs (includ-ing an allowance for administrative costsand margin). The issuer offering coveragethrough the FFE can receive an adjust-ment to the FFE user fee, and the issuer isexpected to pass on a portion of that ad-justment to the third party administrator toaccount for the costs of providing or ar-ranging payments for contraceptive ser-vices. B.Regulatory Alternatives Several provisions in these nal regu- lations involved policy choices. One waswhether to allow a plan or issuer to im-pose cost sharing for an ofce visit whena recommended preventive service is pro-vided in that visit. Sometimes a recom-mended preventive service is billed sepa-rately from the ofce visit; sometimes it isnot. The Departments decided that thecost -sharing prohibition of these nalregulations applies to the specic preven-tive service as recommended by theguidelines. Therefore, if the preventiveservice is billed separately (or is trackedas individual encounter data separately)from the ofce visit, it is the preventiveservice that has cost sharing waived, notthe entire ofce visit. A second policy choice was, if the pre- ventive service is not billed separately (oris not tracked as individual encounter dataseparately) from the ofce visit, whetherthese nal regulations should prohibit cost sharing for any ofce visit in which anyrecommended preventive service was ad-ministered, or whether cost sharing shouldbe prohibited only when the preventiveservice is the primary purpose of the of-ce visit. Prohibiting cost sharing for of-ce visits when any recommended pre-ventive service is provided, regardless ofthe primary purpose of the visit, couldlead to an overly broad application ofthese nal regulations; for example, a per-son who sees a specialist for a particularcondition could end up with a zero copay-ment simply because his or her bloodpressure was taken as part of the ofcevisit. This could create nancial incen-tives for consumers to request preventiveservices at ofce visits that are intendedfor other purposes in order to avoid co-payments and deductibles. The increasedprevalence of the application of zero costsharing would lead to increased premiumscompared with the chosen option, withouta meaningful additional gain in access topreventive services. A third issue involves health plans that have differential cost sharing for servicesprovided by in-network vs. out-of-network providers. These nal regulationsprovide that a plan or issuer generally isnot required to provide coverage for rec-ommended preventive services deliveredby an out-of-network provider. The planor issuer generally may also impose costsharing for recommended preventive ser-vices delivered by an out-of-network pro-vider. However, if the plan or issuer doesnot have in its network a provider who canprovide the recommended preventive ser-vice, the plan or issuer must cover theitem or service when performed by anout-of-network provider, and may not im-pose cost sharing with respect to the itemor service. The Departments consideredthat requiring coverage by out-of-networkproviders with no cost sharing would re-sult in higher premiums. Plans and issuersnegotiate allowed charges with in- network providers as a way to promoteeffective, efcient health care, and allow-ing differences in cost sharing in- andout-of- network enables plans to encour- age use of in-network providers. Allowingzero cost sharing for out-of-network pro-viders could reduce providers' incentivesto participate in insurer networks. The De-partments decided that permitting costsharing for recommended preventive ser-vices provided by out-of-network provid-ers (except in cases where the recom-mended service is only available from anout-of-network provider) is the appropri-ate option to preserve a choice of provid-ers for individuals, while avoiding poten-tially larger increases in costs andtransfers as well as potentially lower qual-ity care. As discussed previously in the pream- ble, the Departments also considered dif-ferent ways to dene a closely held for-prot entity. Under one approach, aqualifying closely held for-prot entitywould have been dened as a for-protentity where none of the ownership inter-ests in the entity is publicly traded andwhere the entity has fewer than a speciednumber of shareholders or owners. Under the second approach, a qualify- ing closely held for-prot entity wouldhave been dened as a for-prot entity inwhich the ownership interests are not pub-licly traded, and in which a specied frac-tion of the ownership interest is concen-trated in a limited and specied number ofowners. Within the second approach, theDepartments considered adopting the IRStest to dene a closely held corporation.The denition adopted in these nal rules,although based on the IRS test, is moreflexible and ensures that it does not ex-clude some entities that should be consid-ered to be closely held for the purposes ofthese nal regulations. Under a third approach, the Depart- ments considered a test under which noneof the ownership interests in the entity ispublicly traded, without any other restric-tions on the number of owners or on own-ership concentration. The Departmentsbelieve, however, that such a test wouldbe excessively broad. 73Bertko, J., Glied, S., et al.

It also has been determined thatsection 553(b) of the Administrative Pro-cedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) does notapply to this rule. Pursuant to the Regula-tory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6), itis hereby certied that this rule will nothave a signicant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities. Thiscertication is based on the fact that theregulations merely modify the denitionof eligible organization to include certainclosely held for-prot entities.

D.Paperwork Reduction Act - Department of Health and HumanServices These nal regulations contain infor- mation collection requirements that aresubject to review by OMB. A descriptionof these provisions is given in the follow-ing paragraphs with an estimate of theannual burden. In order to fairly evaluatewhether an information collection should beapproved by OMB, section 3506(c)(2)(A)of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995requires that we solicit comment on the fol-lowing issues: The need for the information collec- tion and its usefulness in carrying outthe proper functions of our agency. The accuracy of our estimate of the information collection burden. The quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected. Recommendations to minimize the in- formation collection burden on the af-fected public, including automatedcollection techniques.1.Wage Estimates To derive average costs, we used data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics'May 2014 National Occupational Em-ployment and Wage Estimates for all 147.131(b)(3)) All eligible organizations will have the option of either providing a self-certication (EBSA Form 700) to the is-suers or third party administrators of theplans that would otherwise arrange for orprovide coverage for the contraceptiveservices, or providing a notice to HHS.For the purpose of estimating burdens,HHS is assigning the burden of the self - certication to eligible for-prot entitiesand the burden of notice to HHS to eligi-ble non-prot organizations. The July 2013 nal regulations require an eligible organization that seeks an ac-commodation to self-certify that it meetsthe denition of an eligible organizationusing the EBSA Form 700 and provide itdirectly to each third party administratoror issuer of the plan that would otherwisearrange for or provide coverage for thecontraceptive services. These nal regula-tions continue to allow eligible organiza-tions to use EBSA Form 700 to notifytheir third party administrators and issu-ers, as set forth in the July 2013 nalregulations and guidance. The Departments received comments that HHS underestimated the number ofclosely held for-prot eligible organiza-tions that may seek the accommodation.Some commenters noted that it would bedifcult to estimate this number. Onecommenter estimated that about 1.3 mil-lion S-corporations offer health insuranceto their employees and, based on this data,objection rates of 1 percent ofS-corporations would result in 13,000 ob-jecting rms, an objection rate of 2 per-cent would result in 26,000 objectingrms and an objection rate of 5 percentwould result in 65,000 objecting rms.However, the Departments have no indi-cation that such large numbers of closely held for-prot entities would seek the ac-commodation. The Departments also notethat the denition of a qualifying closelyheld for-prot entity adopted in these nalregulations differs from the denition ofan S-corporation. In the proposed rules,based on the number of plaintiffs that arefor-prot employers in recent litigationobjecting on religious grounds to the pro-vision of contraceptive services, HHS es-timated that 71 closely held for-prot en-tities would seek the accommodation. Inthe nal regulations, based on updatedinformation, HHS is revising the estimateto 87. Even though this may underesti-mate the number of eligible closely heldfor-prot entities that will seek the accom-modation, this is the best estimate avail-able to the Departments at this time. For each eligible organization, it is as- sumed that clerical staff will gather andenter the necessary information, send theself-certication to its issuer(s) or thirdparty administrator(s) or the notice to HHS, and retain a copy for recordkeeping.A manager and legal counsel will subse-quently review the information, and a se-nior executive will execute it. It is esti-mated that an organization will needapproximately 50 minutes (30 minutes ofclerical labor at a cost of $30 per hour, 10minutes for a manager at a cost of $102per hour, 5 minutes for legal counsel at acost of $127 per hour, and 5 minutes for asenior executive at a cost of $121 perhour) to execute the self-certication.Therefore, the total one-time burden forpreparing and providing the informationin the self-certication is estimated to beapproximately $53 for each eligible orga-nization. The certication may be elec-tronically transmitted to the issuer or thirdparty administrator at minimal cost ormailed. For purposes of this analysis,HHS assumes that all notices will bemailed. It is estimated that mailing eachnotice will require $0.49 in postage and$0.05 in materials cost (paper and ink) andthe total postage and materials cost foreach notice sent via mail will be $0.54. Based on this estimate of 87 affected entities and the individual burden esti-mates of 50 minutes and a cost of $53, weestimate the total hour burden to be 72.5hours with an equivalent cost of $4,611.The total paper ling cost burden for the August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 120notices is approximately $47. As DOL and HHS share jurisdiction, they are split-ting the hour burden so each will accountfor 36.25 burden hours at an equivalentcost of approximately $2,306 and a paperling cost burden of approximately $23,with approximately 44 respondents. b.ICRs Regarding Notice to HHS (\u00a7 147.131(b)(3)) These nal regulations provide an or- ganization seeking to be treated as an el-igible organization under the August 2014interim nal regulations an alternativeprocess, consistent with the SupremeCourt's interim order in Wheaton College , under which an eligible organization maynotify HHS of its religious objection tocoverage of all or a subset of contracep-tive services. The eligible organizationmust maintain the notice to HHS in itsrecords. The burden related to this alter-nate notice is currently approved underOMB Control Number 0938-1248. Based on litigation, HHS believes that at least 122 eligible non-prot organiza-tions will have the option to provide thealternative notice to HHS rather than theirthird party administrators or issuers. Eventhough this likely underestimates thenumber of eligible non-prot organiza-tions that will seek the accommodation,this is the best estimate available to theDepartments at this time. In order to com-plete this task, HHS assumes that clericalstaff for each eligible organization willgather and enter the necessary informationand send the notice. HHS assumes that acompensation and benets manager andinside legal counsel will review the noticeand a senior executive will execute it.HHS estimates that an eligible organiza-tion will spend approximately 50 minutes(30 minutes of clerical labor at a cost of$30 per hour, 10 minutes for a compensa-tion and benets manager at a cost of$102 per hour, 5 minutes for legal counselat a cost of $127 per hour, and 5 minutesby a senior executive at a cost of $121 perhour) preparing and sending the noticeand ling it to meet the recordkeepingrequirement. Therefore, the total annualburden for preparing and providing thenotice to HHS will require approximately50 minutes for each eligible organizationwith an equivalent cost burden of approx- imately $53 for a total hour burden of 102hours with an equivalent cost of $6,425.As HHS and DOL share jurisdiction, theyare splitting the hour burden so each willaccount for 51 burden hours with anequivalent cost of $3,213, with a total of61 respondents. Notices to HHS may be sent electron- ically at minimal cost or by mail. Forpurposes of this analysis, HHS assumesthat all notices will be mailed. It is esti-mated that mailing each notice will re-quire $0.49 in postage and $0.05 in mate-rials cost (paper and ink) with a totalpostage and materials cost for each noticesent via mail of $0.54. The total cost bur-den for the notices is approximately $66.As DOL and HHS share jurisdiction, theyare splitting the cost burden so each willaccount for $33 of the cost burden. c.Notice of Availability of Separate Payments for Contraceptive Services(\u00a7 147.131(d)) As required by the July 2013 nal reg- ulations, a health insurance issuer or thirdparty administrator providing or arrangingseparate payments for contraceptive ser-vices for participants and beneciaries ininsured plans (or student enrollees andcovered dependents in student health in-surance coverage) of eligible organiza-tions is required to provide a written no-tice to plan participants and beneciaries(or student enrollees and covered depen-dents) informing them of the availabilityof such payments. The notice must beseparate from but contemporaneous with(to the extent possible) any applicationmaterials distributed in connection withenrollment (or re-enrollment) in group orstudent coverage of the eligible organiza-tion in any plan year to which the accom-modation is to apply and will be providedannually. To satisfy the notice require-ment, issuers may, but are not required to,use the model language set forth in theJuly 2013 nal regulations or substantiallysimilar language. As mentioned, HHS is anticipating that at least 122 non-prot and 87 closely heldfor-prot entities will seek an accommo-dation. It is unknown how many issuers orthird party administrators provide healthinsurance coverage or services in connec- tion with health plans of eligible organi-zations, but HHS will assume at least 209.It is estimated that each issuer or thirdparty administrator will need approxi-mately 1 hour of clerical labor (at $30 perhour) and 15 minutes of management re-view (at $102 per hour) to prepare thenotices. The total burden for each issuer orthird party administrator to prepare no-tices will be 1.25 hours with an equivalentcost of approximately $56. The total bur-den for all issuers or third party adminis-trators will be 261.25 hours, with anequivalent cost of $11,600. As DOL andHHS share jurisdiction, they are splittingthe hour burden so each will account for130.63 burden hours with an equivalentcost of $5,800, with approximately 105respondents. d.Letter to HHS Regarding Ownership Structure (\u00a7 147.131(b)(4)(v)) To assist potentially eligible for-prot entities seeking further information re-garding whether they qualify for the ac-commodation, an entity may send a letterdescribing its ownership structure to HHSat accommodation@cms.hhs.gov. How-ever, an entity is not required to availitself of this process in order to qualify asa closely held for-prot entity. As stated earlier in the preamble, the Departments believe that the denitionadopted in these regulations includes thefor-prot entities that are likely to havereligious objections to providing contra-ceptive coverage. In addition, it appearsbased on available information that thedenition adopted in these nal regula-tions includes all of the for-prot entitiesthat have, as of the date of issuance ofthese regulations, challenged the contra-ceptive coverage requirement in court.Therefore, the Departments anticipate thatfewer than 10 entities will submit a letterto HHS. Under 5 CFR 1320.3(c)(4), thisprovision is not subject to the PRA as itwill affect fewer than 10 entities in a12-month period. 3.Summary of Proposed Annual Burden Estimates Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 121Table III.3 Annual Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements Regulation Section(s)OMB Control No. RespondentsTotal ResponsesBurden per Response (hours)Total Annual Burden (hours)Burden Cost per respondent ($)Total Labor Cost of Reporting ($)Total Capital/ Maintenance Costs ($)Total $3,213 $33 $3,246 Availability of Separate Payments for Contraceptive Services (\u00a7 147.131(d))New 105 105 1.25 of PRA-Related Comments We have submitted a copy of this rule to OMB for its review of the rule's infor-mation collection and recordkeeping re-quirements.

E.Paperwork Reduction Act - Department of Labor In accordance with the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995(PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)), the Depart-ment submitted an in accordance with44 U.S.C. 3507(d), contemporaneouslywith the publication of the interim nalregulation, for OMB's review under theemergency PRA procedures. 74OMB ap- proved the ICR on August 27, 2014 underOMB Control Number 1210-0150through February 28, 2015. Contempora-neously with the publication of the emer-gency ICR, the Department published aseparate Federal Register notice inform- ing the public that it intends to requestOMB to extend the approval for 3 years and soliciting comments on the ICR. 75 The Department submitted the extensionrequest to OMB on February 27, 2015.OMB approved the ICR extension onApril 14, 2015, which currently is sched- uled to expire on April 30, 2018. The Department also submitted an ICR to OMB in accordance with 44 U.S.C.3507(d), for the ICR contained in the Au-gust 2014 proposed regulations contem-poraneously with the publication of theproposal that solicited public commentson the ICR. OMB led a comment regard-ing the proposed ICR on October 16,2014, stating that it was not approving theICR associated with the proposed rule atthe proposed rule stage and requesting theDepartment to resubmit the ICR at thenal rule stage after taking into accountpublic comments. OMB assigned OMBControl Number 1210-0152 to the pro-posed ICR. Although no public comments were re- ceived in response to the ICRs containedin the August 2014 interim nal and pro-posed regulations that specically ad-dressed the paperwork burden analysis ofthe information collections, the commentsthat were submitted, and which are de-scribed earlier in this preamble, containedinformation relevant to the costs and ad-ministrative burdens attendant to the pro-posals. The Department took into accountthe public comments in connection withmaking changes to the proposal, analyzingthe economic impact of the proposals, anddeveloping the revised paperwork burden analysis summarized below. In connection with publication of this nal rule, the Department submitted ICRsto OMB as a revision to OMB ControlNumber 1210-0150 for eligible non-protorganizations and under new OMB Con-trol Number 1210-0152 for eligible for-prot organizations and received OMBapproval for both ICRs. A copy of the ICRs may be obtained by contacting the PRA addressee shown be-low or at http://www.RegInfo.gov. PRAADDRESSEE: G. Christopher Cosby, Of-ce of Policy and Research, U.S. Depart-ment of Labor, Employee Benets Secu-rity Administration, (29 CFR 2590.2713A(b) or (c)) Under these nal regulations, all eligi- ble organizations will have the option ofeither providing (1) a self-certication(EBSA Form 700) to the issuers or thirdparty administrators of the plans thatwould otherwise arrange for or providecoverage for the contraceptive services or(2) a notice to HHS. For the purpose ofestimating burdens, the Department is as- 745 CFR 1320.13. 7579 FR 51197 (Aug. 27, 2014). August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 122signing the burden of the self-certication to eligible for-prot entities and the bur-den of notice to HHS to eligible non-protorganizations. The July 2013 nal regulations require an eligible organization that seeks an ac-commodation to self-certify that it meetsthe denition of an eligible organizationusing the EBSA Form 700 and provide itdirectly to each third party administratoror issuer of the plan that would otherwisearrange for or provide coverage for thecontraceptive services. These nal regula-tions continue to allow eligible organiza- tions to use EBSA Form 700 to notifytheir third party administrators and issu-ers, as set forth in the July 2013 nalregulations and guidance. In response to the public comment so- licitation for the ICRs in the August 2014proposed regulations, the Departments re-ceived comments that they underesti-mated the number of closely held for-prot eligible organizations that may seekthe accommodation. Some commentersnoted that it would be difcult to number. One commenter estimatedthat about 1.3 million S-corporations offerhealth insurance to their employees and,based on this data, objection rates of 1percent of S-corporations would result in13,000 objecting rms, an objection rateof 2 percent would result in 26,000 ob-jecting rms and an objection rate of 5percent would result in 65,000 objectingrms. However, the Departments have noindication that such large numbers ofclosely held for-prot entities would seekthe accommodation. The Departmentsalso note that the denition of a qualifyingclosely held for-prot entity adopted inthese nal regulations differs from thedenition of an S-corporation. In the pro-posed rules, based on the number of plain-tiffs that are for-prot employers in recentlitigation objecting on religious groundsto the provision of contraceptive services,the Departments estimated that 71 closelyheld for-prot entities would seek the ac-commodation. In these nal regulations,based on updated information, the Depart- ments are revising the estimate to 87.Even though this may underestimate ofthe number of eligible closely held for-prot entities that will seek the accommo-dation, this is the best estimate availableto the Departments at this time. For each eligible organization, the De- partments assume that clerical staff willgather and enter the necessary informa-tion, send the self-certication to its issu-er(s) or third party administrator(s) or thenotice to HHS, and retain a copy for re-cordkeeping. A manager and legal counsel will subsequently review the information,and a senior executive will execute it. It isestimated that an organization will needapproximately 50 minutes (30 minutes ofclerical labor at a cost of $30 per hour, 76 10 minutes for a manager at a cost of $102per hour, 775 minutes for legal counsel at a cost of $127 per hour,78and 5 minutes for a senior executive at a cost of $121 perhour 79) to execute the self-certication. Therefore, the Departments estimate thatthe total one-time burden for preparingand providing the information in the self-certication is estimated to be approxi-mately $53 for each eligible organization.The certication may be electronicallytransmitted to the issuer or third partyadministrator at minimal cost or mailed.For purposes of this analysis, the Depart-ments assume that all notices will bemailed. The Departments estimate thatmailing each notice will require $0.49 inpostage and $0.05 in materials cost (paperand ink) and the total postage and mate-rials cost for each notice sent via mail willbe $0.54. Based on this estimate of 87 affected entities and the individual burden esti-mates of 50 minutes and a cost of $53, theDepartments estimate the total hour bur-den associated with the ICR to be 72.5hours with an equivalent cost of $4,611.The total paper ling cost burden for thenotices is approximately $47. The hourburden associated with the ICR is allo-cated equally between DOL and HHS,because the agencies share jurisdiction of preventive health services resulting in anhour burden for each agency of 36.25 burden hours at an equivalent cost of ap-proximately $2,306 and a paper ling costburden of approximately $23, with ap-proximately 44 respondents. 2.ICRs Regarding Notice to HHS (29 CFR 2590.2713A (b) or (c)) These nal regulations provide an or- ganization seeking to be treated as an el-igible organization under the August 2014interim nal regulations with an alterna-tive process, consistent with the SupremeCourt's interim order in Wheaton College , under which an eligible organization maynotify HHS of its religious objection tocoverage of all or a subset of contracep-tive services. The eligible organizationmust maintain the notice to HHS in itsrecords. The burden related to this alter-nate notice is currently approved underOMB Control Number 1210-0150. Based on litigation, the Departments estimate that at least 122 eligible non-prot organizations will have the option toprovide the alternative notice to HHSrather than their third party administratorsor issuers. Even though this may underes-timate the number of eligible non-protorganizations that will seek the accommo-dation, it is the best estimate available tothe Departments at this time. In order tocomplete this task, the Departments as-sume that clerical staff for each eligibleorganization will gather and enter the nec-essary information and send the notice.The Departments assume that a compen-sation and benets manager and insidelegal counsel will review the notice and asenior executive will execute it. The De-partments estimate that an eligible organi-zation will spend approximately 50 min-utes (30 minutes of clerical labor at a costof $30 per hour, 10 minutes for a com-pensation and benets manager at a costof $102 per hour, 5 minutes for legalcounsel at a cost of $127 per hour, and 5 76Secretaries, Except Legal, Medical, and Executive (43-6014): $16.13(2012 BLS Wage rate)/0.679(ECEC ratio) *1.2(Overhead Load Factor) *1.019(In flation rate) 2 (Inflated 2 years from base year) /H11005$29.60 77Compensation and Benets Manager (11-3041): ratio) *1.35(Overhead Load Factor) *1.019(Inflation rate) 2 (Inflated 2 years from base year) /H11005$102.41 78Legal Professional (23-1011): $62.93(2012 BLS Wage rate) /0.697(ECEC ratio) *1.35(Overhead Load Factor) *1.019(Inflation rate) 2 (Inflated 2 years from base year) /H11005$126.56 79Financial Managers (11-3031): $59.26(2012 BLS Wage rate) /0.689(ECEC ratio) *1.35(Overhead Load Factor) *1.019(Inflation rate) 2 (Inflated 2 years from base year) /H11005$120.57 Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 123minutes by a senior executive at a cost of $121 per hour) preparing and sending thenotice and ling it to meet the recordkeep-ing requirement. Therefore, the total an-nual burden for preparing and providingthe notice to HHS will require approxi-mately 50 minutes for each eligible orga-nization with an equivalent cost burden ofapproximately $53 for a total hour burdenof 102 hours with an equivalent cost of$6,425. As HHS and DOL share jurisdic-tion, they are splitting the hour burden soeach will account for 51 burden hourswith an equivalent cost of $3,213, with atotal of 61 respondents. Notices to HHS may be sent electron- ically at minimal cost or by mail. Forpurposes of this analysis, the Departmentsassume that all notices will be mailed. It isestimated that mailing each notice willrequire $0.49 in postage and $0.05 in ma-terials cost (paper and ink) with a totalpostage and materials cost for each noticesent via mail of $0.54. The total cost bur-den for the notices is approximately $66.As DOL and HHS share jurisdiction, theyare sharing the cost burden equally andeach is attributed $33 of the cost burden. 3.Notice of Availability of Separate Payments for Contraceptive Services (29CFR 2590.2713A(d)) As required by the July 2013 nal reg- ulations, a health insurance issuer or thirdparty administrator providing or arrangingseparate payments for contraceptive ser-vices for participants and beneciaries (orstudent enrollees and covered dependents)in insured plans of eligible organizationsis required to provide a written notice toplan participants and beneciaries (or stu-dent enrollees and covered dependents)informing them of the availability of suchpayments. The notice must be separatefrom but contemporaneous with (to theextent possible) any application materialsdistributed in connection with enrollment(or re-enrollment) in group or student cov-erage of the eligible organization in anyplan year to which the accommodation is to apply and will be provided annually. Tosatisfy the notice requirement, issuersmay, but are not required to, use themodel language set forth in the July 2013 nal regulations or substantially similarlanguage. As mentioned, the Departments antici- pate that at least 122 non-prot and 87closely held for-prot entities will seek anaccommodation. It is unknown how manyissuers or third party administrators pro-vide health insurance coverage or servicesin connection with health plans of eligibleorganizations, but that for the purposes ofthe analysis, the Departments assume at least 209 do. The Departments assumethat each issuer or third party administra-tor will need approximately one hour ofclerical labor (at $30 per hour) and 15minutes of management review (at $102per hour) to prepare the notices. There-fore, the Departments estimate that thetotal burden for each issuer or third partyadministrator to prepare notices will be1.25 hours with an equivalent cost of ap-proximately $56. The total burden for allissuers or third party administrators willbe 261.25 hours, with an equivalent costof $11,600. The cost burden associatedwith this ICR is allocated equally betweenDOL and HHS, because the agenciesshare jurisdiction under the provision.Therefore, the hour burden for each is130.63 burden hours with an equivalentcost of $5,800 for approximately 105 re-spondents. 4.Letter to HHS Regarding Ownership Structure (29 CFR 2590.2713A(a)(4)(v)) To assist potentially eligible for-prot entities seeking further information re-garding whether they qualify for the ac-commodation, an entity may send a letterdescribing its ownership structure to HHSat accommodation@cms.hhs.gov. How-ever, an entity is not required to availitself of this process in order to qualify asa closely held for-prot entity. As stated earlier in the preamble, the Departments believe that the denitionadopted in these regulations includes thefor-prot entities that are likely to havereligious objections to providing contra-ceptive coverage. In addition, it appearsbased on available information that thedenition adopted in these nal regula-tions includes all of the for-prot entities that have, as of the date of issuance ofthese regulations, challenged the contra-ceptive coverage requirement in court.Therefore, the Departments anticipate thatfewer than 10 entities will submit a letterto HHS. Under 5 CFR 1320.3(c)(4), thisprovision is not subject to the PRA as itwill affect fewer than 10 entities in a12-month period. F.Regulatory Flexibility Act - Department of Labor and Department ofHealth and Human Services The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires agencies that issue a rule to ana-lyze options for regulatory relief of smallbusinesses if a rule has a signicant im-pact on a substantial number of small en-tities. The generally denes a \"smallentity\" as\u2014(1) a proprietary rm meetingthe size standards of the Small BusinessAdministration (SBA), (2) a non-prot or-ganization that is not dominant in its eld,or (3) a small government jurisdictionwith a population of less than 50,000(states and individuals are not included inthe denition of \"small entity\"). The De-partments use as their measure of signi-cant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities a change in rev-enues of more than 3 percent to 5 percent. As discussed in the Web Portal interim nal rule with comment period publishedon May 5, 2010 (75 FR 24481), HHSexamined the health insurance industry indepth in the Regulatory Impact Analysiswe prepared for the proposed rule on es-tablishment of the Medicare Advantageprogram (69 FR 46866, August 3, 2004).In that analysis it was determined thatthere were few, if any, insurance rmsunderwriting comprehensive health insur-ance policies (in contrast, for example, totravel insurance policies or dental dis-count policies) that fell below the sizethresholds for \"small\" business estab-lished by the SBA (currently $38.5 mil-lion in annual receipts for health insuranceissuers). 80In addition, analysis of data from Medical Loss Ratio annual reportsubmissions for the 2013 reporting yearwas used to develop an estimate of the 80\"Table of Small Business Size Standards Matched To North American Industry Classication System Codes,\" effective July 14, 2014, U.S. Small Busines s Administration, available at http://www.sba.gov. August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 124number of small entities that offer com- prehensive major medical coverage. It isestimated that 141 out of 500 issuers ofhealth insurance coverage nationwide hadtotal premium revenue of $38.5 million orless. This estimate may overstate the ac-tual number of small health insurancecompanies that would be affected, since77 percent of these small companies be-long to larger holding groups, and many ifnot all of these small companies are likelyto have non-health lines of business thatwould result in their revenues exceeding$38.5 million. For these reasons, the De-partments expect that these nal regula-tions will not affect a signicant numberof small issuers . The provisions of these nal regula- tions affect small employers with self-insured group health plans by requiringthem to include coverage under theirgroup health plans for recommended pre-ventive services without cost sharing.However, small employers also benetfrom having healthier employees and re-duced absenteeism. Small employers areless likely to be self-insured compared tolarge employers; only about 13.3 percentof employers with less than 100 employ-ees that offer a group health plan have aself-funded plan. 81 With respect to contraceptive cover- age, some eligible organizations that seekthe accommodation may be small entitiesand will incur costs to provide the self-certication to issuers or third party ad-ministrators or notice to HHS. However,the related administrative costs are ex-pected to be minimal. Third party administrators for self- insured group health plans established ormaintained by eligible organizations willincur administrative costs to send noticesto enrollees and arrange for separate pay-ments for contraceptive services. It is un-known how many third party administra-tors impacted by this requirement haverevenues below the size thresholds for\"small\" business established by the SBA(currently $32.5 million for third partyadministrators). However, a third partyadministrator can make arrangementswith an issuer offering coverage throughan FFE to obtain reimbursement for thethird party administrator's costs.G.Federalism Statement - Department of Labor and Department of Health andHuman Services Executive Order 13132 outlines funda- mental principles of federalism, and re-quires the adherence to specic criteria byfederal agencies in the process of theirformulation and implementation of poli-cies that have \"substantial direct effects\"on the states, the relationship between thenational government and states, or on thedistribution of power and responsibilitiesamong the various levels of government.In the Departments' view, these nal reg-ulations have federalism implications, butthe federalism implications are substan-tially mitigated because, with respect tohealth insurance issuers, 45 states are ei-ther enforcing the requirements related tocoverage of specied preventive services(including contraception) without costsharing pursuant to state law or otherwiseare working collaboratively with HHS toensure that issuers meet these standards.In ve states, HHS ensures that issuerscomply with these requirements. There-fore, the nal regulations are not likely torequire substantial additional oversight ofstates by HHS. In general, section 514 of ERISA pro- vides that state laws are superseded to theextent that they relate to any covered em-ployee benet plan, and preserves statelaws that regulate insurance, banking, orsecurities. ERISA also prohibits statesfrom regulating a covered plan as an in-surance or investment company or bank.The Health Insurance Portability and Ac-countability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) addeda new preemption provision to ERISA (aswell as to the PHS Act) narrowly pre-empting state requirements on grouphealth insurance coverage. States may continue to apply state law requirementsbut not to the extent that such require-ments prevent the application of the fed-eral requirement that group health insur-ance coverage provided in connectionwith certain group health plans (or studenthealth insurance issuers) provide coveragefor specied preventive services withoutcost sharing. HIPAA's Conference Reportstates that the conferees intended the nar-rowest preemption of state laws with re-gard to health (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-736, 104th Cong. 2dSession 205, 1996). State insurance lawsthat are more stringent than the federalrequirement are unlikely to \"prevent theapplication of\" the preventive servicescoverage provision, and therefore are un-likely to be preempted. Accordingly,states have signicant latitude to imposerequirements on health insurance issuersthat are more restrictive than those in fed-eral law. Guidance conveying this interpretation was published in the Federal Register on April 8, 1997 (62 FR 16904) and Decem-ber 30, 2004 (69 FR regulations implement preventiveservices coverage provision's minimumstandards and do not signicantly reducethe discretion given to states under thestatutory scheme. The PHS Act provides that states may enforce the provisions of title XXVII ofthe PHS Act as they pertain to issuers, butthat the Secretary of HHS will enforce anyprovisions that a state does not have au-thority to enforce or that a state has failedto substantially enforce. When exercisingits responsibility to enforce provisions ofthe PHS Act, HHS works cooperativelywith the state to address the state's con-cerns and avoid conflicts with the state'sexercise of its authority. HHS has devel-oped procedures to implement its enforce-ment responsibilities, and to afford statesthe maximum opportunity to enforce thePHS Act's requirements in the rst in-stance. In compliance with Executive Or-der 13132's requirement that agencies ex- amine closely any policies that may havefederalism implications or limit the poli-cymaking discretion of states, the Depart-ments have engaged in numerous effortsto consult and work cooperatively withaffected state and local ofcials. In conclusion, throughout the process of developing these nal regulations, tothe extent feasible within the specic pre-emption provisions of ERISA and thePHS Act, the Departments have attemptedto balance states' interests in regulatinghealth insurance coverage and health in-surance issuers, and the rights of individ-uals intended to be protected in the PHSAct, ERISA, and the Code. 81Source: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Center for Financing, Access and Cost Trends. 2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Insurance Component.

Rather, it focuseson certain categories of cost, mainly those\"Federal mandate\" costs resulting from\u2014(1) imposing enforceable duties on state, local, or tribal governments, or on theprivate sector; or (2) increasing thestringency of conditions in, or decreas-ing the funding of, state, local, or tribalgovernments under entitlement pro-grams. These nal regulations includeno mandates on state, local, or tribalgovernments. Health insurance issuers,third party administrators and eligibleorganizations would incur costs to com-ply with the provisions of these nalregulations. However, consistent withpolicy embodied in UMRA, these nalregulations have been designed to be theleast burdensome alternative whileachieving the objectives of the Afford-able Care Act. I.Congressional Review Act These nal rules are subject to the Con- gressional Review Act provisions of theSmall Business Regulatory EnforcementFairness Act of 1996 (5 U.S.C. 801 etseq.), which species that before a rulecan take effect, the federal agency pro-mulgating the rule shall submit to eachHouse of the Congress and to the Comp-troller General a report containing a copyof the rule along with other specied in-formation, and have been transmitted toCongress and the Comptroller General forreview.

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Internal Revenue Service26 CFR Chapter IAccordingly, 26 CFR part 54 is amended as follows: PART 54\u2014PENSION EXCISE TAXES Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 54 continues to read in part as fol-lows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 780 5*** Section 54.9815-2713 der 26 U.S.C. 9833; *****Par.2. Section 54.9815-2713 is amended by adding paragraphs (a)(1)(i),(ii), and (iii), and revising paragraphs(a)(2), (3), (4), and (5), (b), and (c) to readas follows: \u00a7 54.9815-2713 Coverage of preventive health services. (a) * * * (1) * * *(i) Evidence-based items or services that have in effect a rating of A or B in thecurrent recommendations of the UnitedStates Preventive Services Task Forcewith respect to the individual involved(except as otherwise provided in para-graph (c) of this section); (ii) Immunizations for routine use in children, adolescents, and adults that havein effect a recommendation from the Ad-visory Committee on Immunization Prac-tices of the Centers for Disease Controland Prevention with respect to the indi-vidual involved (for this purpose, a rec-ommendation from the Advisory Commit-tee on Immunization Practices of theCenters for Disease Control and Preven-tion is considered in effect after it hasbeen adopted by the Director of the Cen- August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 126ters for Disease Control and Prevention, and a recommendation is considered to befor routine use if it is listed on the Immu-nization Schedules of the Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention); (iii) With respect to infants, children, and adolescents, evidence-informed pre-ventive care and screenings provided forin comprehensive guidelines supported bythe Health Resources and Services Ad- ministration; and *****(2)Ofce visits - (i) If an item or service described in paragraph (a)(1) ofthis section is billed separately (or istracked as individual encounter data sep-arately) from an ofce visit, then a plan orissuer may impose cost-sharing require-ments with respect to the ofce visit. (ii) If an item or service described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is notbilled separately (or is not tracked as in-dividual encounter data separately) froman ofce visit and the primary purpose ofthe ofce visit is the delivery of such anitem or service, then a plan or issuer maynot impose cost-sharing requirementswith respect to the ofce visit. (iii) If an item or service described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is notbilled separately (or is not tracked as in-dividual encounter data separately) froman ofce visit and the primary purpose ofthe ofce visit is not the delivery of suchan item or service, then a plan or issuermay impose cost-sharing requirementswith respect to the ofce visit. (iv) The rules of this paragraph (a)(2) are illustrated by the following examples: Example 1 . (i)Facts . An individual covered by a group health plan visits an in-network health careprovider. While visiting the provider, the individ-ual is screened for cholesterol abnormalities,which has in effect a rating of A or B in the currentrecommendations of the United States PreventiveServices Task Force with respect to the individual.The provider bills the plan for an ofce visit andfor the laboratory work of the cholesterol screen-ing test. (ii)Conclusion . In this Example 1 , the plan may not impose any cost-sharing requirements with re-spect to the separately-billed laboratory work of thecholesterol screening test. Because the ofce visit isbilled separately from the cholesterol screening test,the plan may impose cost-sharing requirements forthe ofce visit. Example 2 . (i)Facts . Same facts as Example 1 of this section. As the result of the screening, the indi-vidual is diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and is pre-scribed a course of treatment that is not included inthe recommendations under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. (ii)Conclusion . In this Example 2 , because the treatment is not included in the recommendationsunder paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the plan is notprohibited from imposing cost-sharing requirementswith respect to the treatment. Example 3 . (i)Facts . An individual covered by a group health plan visits an in-network health careprovider to discuss recurring abdominal pain. Duringthe visit, the individual has a blood pressure screen-ing, which has in effect a rating of A or B in thecurrent recommendations of the United States Pre-ventive Services Task Force with respect to the in-dividual. The provider bills the plan for an ofcevisit. (ii)Conclusion . In this Example 3 , the blood pressure screening is provided as part of an ofcevisit for which the primary purpose was not to de-liver items or services described in paragraph (a)(1)of this section. Therefore, the plan may impose acost-sharing requirement for the ofce visit charge. Example 4 . (i)Facts . A child covered by a group health plan visits an in-network pediatrician to re-ceive an annual physical exam described as part ofthe comprehensive guidelines supported by theHealth Resources and Services Administration. Dur-ing the ofce visit, the child receives additionalitems and services that are not described in thecomprehensive guidelines supported by the HealthResources and Services Administration, nor other-wise described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.The provider bills the plan for an ofce visit. (ii)Conclusion . In this Example 4 , the service was not billed as a separate charge and was billed aspart of an ofce visit. Moreover, the primary purposefor the visit was to deliver items and services de-scribed as part of the comprehensive guidelines sup-ported by the Health Resources and Services Admin-istration. Therefore, the plan may not impose a cost-sharing requirement with respect to the ofce visit. (3)Out-of-network providers . (i) Sub- ject to paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section,nothing in this section requires a plan orissuer that has a network of providers to provide benets for items or services de-scribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this sectionthat are delivered by an out-of-networkprovider. Moreover, nothing in this sec-tion precludes a plan or issuer that has anetwork of providers from imposing cost-sharing requirements for items or servicesdescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this sec-tion that are delivered by an out-of-network provider. (ii) If a plan or issuer does not have in its network a provider who can provide anitem or service described in paragraph(a)(1) of this section, the plan or issuermust cover the item or service when per-formed by an out-of-network provider,and may not impose cost-sharing with re-spect to the item or service.(4)Reasonable medical management . Nothing prevents a plan or issuer fromusing reasonable medical managementtechniques to determine the frequency,method, treatment, or setting for an itemor service described in paragraph (a)(1) ofthis section to the extent not specied inthe relevant recommendation or guideline.To the extent not specied in a recom-mendation or guideline, a plan or issuermay rely on the relevant clinical evidencebase and established reasonable medicalmanagement techniques to determine thefrequency, method, treatment, or settingfor coverage of a recommended preven-tive health service. (5)Services not described . Nothing in this section prohibits a plan or issuer fromproviding coverage for items and servicesin addition to those recommended by theUnited States Preventive Services TaskForce or the Advisory Committee on Im-munization Practices of the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention, or pro-vided for by guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Adminis-tration, or from denying coverage foritems and services that are not recom-mended by that task force or that advisorycommittee, or under those guidelines. Aplan or issuer may impose cost-sharingrequirements for a treatment not describedin paragraph (a)(1) of this section, even ifthe treatment results from an item or ser-vice described in paragraph (a)(1) of thissection. (b)Timing \u2014(1) In general . A plan or issuer must provide coverage pursuant toparagraph (a)(1) of this section for planyears that begin on or after September 23,2010, or, if later, for plan years that beginon or after the date that is one year afterthe date the recommendation or guidelineis issued. (2)Changes in recommendations or guidelines . (i) A plan or issuer that is required to provide coverage for any itemsand services specied in any recommen-dation or guideline described in paragraph(a)(1) of this section on the rst day of aplan year must provide coverage throughthe last day of the plan year, even if therecommendation or guideline changes isor is no longer described in paragraph(a)(1) of this section, during the plan year. (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, to the extent a Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 127recommendation or guideline described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section that wasin effect on the rst day of a plan year isdowngraded to a \"D\" rating, or any itemor service associated with any recommen-dation or guideline specied in paragraph(a)(1) of this section is subject to a safetyrecall or is otherwise determined to pose asignicant safety concern by a federalagency authorized to regulate the item orservice during a plan year, there is norequirement under this section to coverthese items and services through the lastday of the plan year. (c)Recommendations not current . For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this sec-tion, and for purposes of any other provi-sion of law, recommendations of theUnited States Preventive Services TaskForce regarding breast cancer screening,mammography, and prevention issued inor around November 2009 are not consid-ered to be current. Par.3 Section 54.9815-2713A is amended by revising paragraphs (a), (b),(c)(1), and (c)(2)(i) introductory text toread as follows: \u00a7 54.9815-2713A Accommodations in connection with coverage ofpreventive health services. (a)Eligible organizations . An eligible organization is an organization that meetsthe criteria of paragraphs (a)(1) through(3) of this section.

Items of General Interest Suspension of Benets under the MultiemployerPension Reform Act of2014 REG-102648-15 AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemak- ing, notice of proposed rulemaking bycross-reference to temporary regulations,and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: This document contains proposed regulations relating to multiem-ployer pension plans that are projected tohave insufcient funds, at some point inthe future, to pay the full benets to whichindividuals will be entitled under the plans(referred to as plans in \"critical and de-clining status\"). The Multiemployer Pen-sion Reform Act of 2014 (\"MPRA\")amended the Internal Revenue Code toincorporate suspension of benets provi-sions that permit these multiemployerplans to reduce pension benets payableto participants and beneciaries if certain conditions are satised. MPRA requiresthe Secretary of the Treasury, in consul-tation with the Pension Benet GuarantyCorporation and the Secretary of Labor, toapprove or deny applications by theseplans to reduce benets. As required byMPRA, these proposed regulations, to-gether with temporary regulations beingpublished at the same time, provide guid-ance implementing these statutory provi-sions. These proposed regulations wouldaffect active, retired, and deferred vestedparticipants and beneciaries of multiem-ployer plans that are in critical and declin-ing status as well as employers contribut-ing to, and sponsors and administrators of,those plans. DATES: Comments must be received by August 18, 2015. Outlines of topics to bediscussed at the public hearing scheduledfor September 10, 2015 must be receivedby August Send submissions to: room5205, Franklin Station, WashingtonD.C. 20044. Submissions may be hand- delivered Monday through Friday between thehours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. to: CC:PA:LPD:PR(REG-102648-15), Courier's Desk, InternalRevenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue,NW., Washington, D.C., or sent electronicallyvia the Federal eRulemaking Portal at http://www.regulations.gov (IRS REG-102648-15). The public hearing will beheld in the Amphitheater of the RonaldReagan Building and International TradeCenter, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave., NW.,Washington, D.C.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act The collection of information con- tained in this notice of proposed rulemak-ing has been submitted to the Ofce ofManagement and Budget for review inaccordance with the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)). The collection of information in the paragraphs of these proposed regulationsthat cross-reference the temporary regula-tions that are being published elsewhere inthis issue of the Federal Register is re- quired for a multiemployer dened benetplan in critical and declining status to sat-isfy the criteria for approval of an appli-cation for a suspension of benets, includ-ing providing notice of the application tospecied individuals (containing an indi-vidualized estimate of the size of the ben-et suspension) and other interested par-ties. The collection is also required for aplan sponsor to obtain approval of theballot for the vote on the suspension ofbenets that follows approval of the ap-plication. The collection of information in the paragraphs of these proposed regulationsthat do not cross-reference the temporaryregulations is required for a multiem-ployer dened benet plan in critical and declining status to maintain an annualwritten record of its determinations thatall reasonable measures to avoid insol-vency have been taken and that the plan isnot projected to avoid insolvency withouta suspension of benets. Comments on the collection of infor- mation should be sent to the Ofce of Management and Budget , Attn: Desk Ofcer for the Department of the Trea-sury, Ofce of Information and Regula-tory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503, withcopies to the Internal Revenue Service,Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Ofcer, SE:W:CAR:MP:T:T:SP, Washington, DC20224. Comments on the collection ofinformation should be received by August18, 2015. Comments are specically re-quested concerning: Whether the proposed collection of in- formation is necessary for the proper per-formance of the functions of the IRS, in-cluding whether the information will havepractical utility; The accuracy of the estimated burden associated with the proposed collection ofinformation; How the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be collected may beenhanced; How the burden of complying with the proposed collections of information maybe minimized, including through the ap-plication of automated collection tech-niques or other forms of information tech-nology; and Estimates of capital or start-up costs and costs of operation, maintenance, andpurchase of service to provide informa-tion. For the paragraphs of the proposed reg- ulations that cross-reference the tempo-rary regulations: Estimated total average annual reporting or recordkeeping burden: 13,888 hours. Estimated average annual burden per recordkeeper: 496 hours. Estimated number of recordkeepers: 28.For the paragraphs of the proposed reg- ulations that do not cross-reference thetemporary regulations: Estimated total average annual report- ing or recordkeeping burden: 140 hours. August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 134Estimated average annual burden per recordkeeper: 5 hours. Estimated number of recordkeepers: 28. An agency may not conduct or spon- sor, and a person is not required to re-spond to, a collection of information un-less it displays a valid control numberassigned by the Ofce of Managementand Budget. Books or records relating to a collec- tion of information must be retained aslong as their contents may become mate-rial in the administration of any internalrevenue law. Generally, tax returns andtax return information are condential, asrequired by 26 Section 432(e)(9) 1of Internal Rev- enue Code (Code) permits the plan spon-sor of a multiemployer plan that is pro-jected to have insufcient funds, at somepoint in the future, to pay the full benetsto which individuals will be entitled underthe plan (referred to as a plan in \"criticaland declining status\") to reduce the pen-sion benets payable to participants andbeneciaries under the plan if certain con-ditions are satised (referred to as a \"sus-pension of benets\"). MPRA requires theSecretary of the Treasury, in consultationwith the Pension Benet Guaranty Corpo-ration (PBGC) and the Secretary of Labor(generally referred to in this preamble asthe Treasury Department, PBGC, and La-bor Department, respectively), to issue ap-propriate guidance to implement the pro-visions of section 432(e)(9). Thisdocument contains proposed regulationsunder section 432(e)(9) that, together withtemporary regulations that are being pub-lished elsewhere in this issue of the Fed- eral Register and a revenue procedure being published in the Internal RevenueBulletin, Rev. Proc. 2015-34, implementsection 432(e)(9), as required by the stat-ute. The Treasury Department consultedwith the PBGC and the Labor Departmenton these proposed regulations.The temporary regulations, which are applicable immediately, provide sufcientguidance to enable a plan sponsor thatwishes to apply for approval of a suspen-sion of benets to prepare and submitsuch an application, and to enable theDepartment of the Treasury to begin theprocessing of such an application. Thetemporary regulations provide generalguidance regarding section 432(e)(9), in-cluding guidance regarding the meaningof the term \"suspension of benets,\" thegeneral conditions for a suspension ofbenets, and the implementation of a sus-pension after a participant vote. This no-tice of proposed rulemaking requestscomments on the provisions of the tempo-rary regulations, and the provisions of thetemporary regulations and proposed regu-lations are expected to be integrated andissued as a single set of nal regulationswith any changes that are made followingconsideration of the comments. The proposed regulations included in this document are not applicable immedi-ately. The proposed regulations provideadditional guidance regarding section432(e)(9), including guidance relating tothe standards that will be applied in re-viewing an application for suspension ofbenets and the statutory limitations on asuspension of benets. For further back-ground on the statutory provisions thatthese proposed regulations and the tempo-rary regulations that are incorporated bycross-reference into these proposed regu-lations are designed to implement, see thepreamble to the temporary regulations inthe Rules and Regulations section of thisissue of the Federal Register . The regulations implementing the stat- utory suspension of benets provisionshave been divided, as described, into pro- posed regulations and temporary regula-tions in order to balance the interest inconsidering public comments on rules be-fore they apply with the evident statutoryintent, reflected in MPRA, to implementthe statutory provisions without undue de-lay. Although the Treasury Departmenthas issued proposed and temporary regu- lations under section 432(e)(9), it is ex-pected that no application proposing abenet suspension will be approved priorto the issuance of nal regulations. If aplan sponsor chooses to submit an appli-cation for approval of a proposed benetsuspension in accordance with the pro-posed and temporary regulations beforethe issuance of nal regulations, then theplan sponsor may need to revise the pro-posed suspension (and potentially the re-lated notices to plan participants) or sup-plement the application to take intoaccount any differences in the require-ments relating to suspensions of benetsthat might be included in the nal regula-tions. Rev. Proc. 2015-34 prescribes the spe- cics of the application process for ap-proval of a proposed benet suspension.The revenue procedure also provides amodel notice that a plan sponsor propos-ing a benet suspension may use to satisfythe statutory notice requirement. Conditions for suspensions As a condition for suspension of ben- ets, the statute requires a plan sponsor todetermine, in a written record to be main-tained throughout the period of the benetsuspension, that although all reasonablemeasures to avoid insolvency have beentaken (and continue to be taken during theperiod of the benet suspension), the planis still projected to become insolvent un-less benets are suspended. In making thisdetermination, the plan sponsor may takeinto account factors including a speciedlist of 10 statutory factors. 2See section 432(e)(9)(C)(ii). Limitations on suspensions Section 432(e)(9)(D) contains limita- tions on the benets that may be sus-pended, some of which apply to plan par-ticipants and beneciaries on anindividual basis and some of which applyon an aggregate basis. Under the statute, 1Section 432(e)(9) was added to the Internal Revenue Code by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-280 (120 Stat. 780 (2006)) (PPA '06) and a mended by the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, Division O of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, Public Law 113-235 (128 Stat. 2130 (2014) ) (MPRA). 2These 10 factors are current and past contribution levels; levels of benet accruals (including prior reductions in the rate of benet accruals); pri or adjustable benet reductions and suspensions of benets; the impact on plan solvency of the subsidies and ancillary benets available to active participants; compensation levels of active participants relative to employees in the participants' industry generally; competitive and other economic factors facing contributing employers; the impact of benet and contribut ion levels on retaining active participants and bargaining groups under the plan; the impact of past and anticipated contribution increases under the plan on employer attrition and retention le vels; and measures undertaken by the plan sponsor to retain or attract contributing employers. Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 135an individual's monthly benet may not be reduced below 110 percent of themonthly benet that is guaranteed by thePBGC under section 4022A of the Em-ployee Retirement Income Security Act of1974, Public Law 93-406 (88 Stat. 829(1974)), as amended (ERISA) on the dateof the suspension. In addition, no benetsbased on disability (as dened under theplan) may be suspended. In the case of a participant or bene- ciary who has attained age 75 as of theeffective date of a suspension, the statuteprovides that the suspension may not ex-ceed the applicable percentage of the in-dividual's maximum suspendable benet(the age-based limitation). individual's benet thatwould be suspended without regard to theage-based limitation. The applicable per-centage is a percentage that is determinedby dividing (i) the number of months dur-ing the period that begins with the monthafter the month in which the suspension iseffective and ends with the month inwhich that participant or beneciary at-tains the age of 80 by (ii) 60 months. Section 432(e)(9)(D) also requires the aggregate benet suspensions (consid-ered, if applicable, in connection with aplan partition under section 4233 ofERISA (partition)) to be reasonably esti-mated to achieve, but not materially ex-ceed, the level that is needed to avoidinsolvency. Under the statute, any suspension of benets must be equitably distributedacross the participant and beneciary popu-lation, taking into account factors that mayinclude one or more of a list of 11 statutoryfactors. 3See section 432(e)(9)(D)(vi). Fi- nally, with regard to a suspension ofbenets that is made in combinationwith a plan partition, the suspensionmay not occur before the effective dateof the partition.Benet improvements Section 432(e)(9)(E) sets forth rules relating to benet improvements madewhile a suspension of benets is in effect.Under this provision, a benet improve- ment is dened as a resumption of sus-pended benets, an increase in benets, anincrease in the rate at which benets ac-crue, or an increase in the rate at whichbenets become nonforfeitable under theplan. The statute also provides that, while a suspension of benets is in effect, a plansponsor generally has discretion to pro-vide benet improvements. However, asponsor may not increase plan liabilitiesby reason of any benet improvement forany participant or beneciary who is notin pay status (in other words, those whoare not yet receiving benets, such as ac-tive employees or deferred vested em-ployees) unless (1) this benet improve-ment is accompanied by an equitabledistribution of benet improvements forthose who have begun to receive benets(typically, retirees), and (2) the plan actu-ary certies that, after taking those benetimprovements into account, the plan isprojected to avoid insolvency inde-nitely. 4Whether an individual is in pay status for this purpose is generally basedon whether the individual's benets beganbefore the rst day of the plan year forwhich the benet improvement took ef-fect. In order for benet improvements to be equitably distributed, the projected valueof the total liabilities attributable to bene-t improvements for participants and ben-eciaries who are not in pay status maynot exceed the projected value of the lia-bilities attributable to benet improve-ments for participants and beneciarieswho are in pay status. See section432(e)(9)(E)(ii). The plan sponsor mustequitably distribute any increase in totalliabilities attributable to the benet im-provements among the participants andbeneciaries who are in pay status, takinginto account the factors relevant to the equitable distribution of benet suspen-sions among participants and beneciaries(described in section 432(e)(9)(D)(vi))and the extent to which their benets weresuspended. The statute allows a plan sponsor to increase plan liabilities through a resump-tion of benets for participants and bene-ciaries in pay status without providingany benet improvements for those whoare not yet in pay status, but only if itequitably distributes the value of resumedbenets among participants and benecia-ries in pay status, taking into account thefactors relevant to the equitable distribu-tion of benet suspensions. The restrictions on benet improve- ments in section 432(e)(9)(E) apply in ad-dition to any other applicable limitationson increases in benets that apply to aplan, except with respect to resumptionsof suspended benets only for participantsand beneciaries in pay status (describedin the preceding sentence). Suspension applications Section 432(e)(9)(G) describes the pro- cess for approval or rejection of a plansponsor's application for a suspension ofbenets. Under the statute, the TreasuryDepartment, in consultation with thePBGC and the Labor Department, mustapprove an application upon nding thatthe plan is eligible for the suspensions andhas satised the criteria of sections432(e)(9)(C), (D), (E), and (F). In evalu-ating whether a plan sponsor has met thecriteria in section 432(e)(9)(C)(ii) (a plansponsor's determination that, although allreasonable measures have been taken, the plan will become insolvent if benetsare not suspended), the plan sponsor'sconsideration of factors under thatclause must be reviewed. The statute also requires that the plan sponsor's de-terminations in an application for a sus-pension of benets be accepted unlessthey are clearly erroneous. 3These 11 factors are age and life expectancy; length of time in pay status; amount of benet; type of benet; extent of a subsidized benet; extent of pos t-retirement benet increases; history of benet increases and reductions; years to retirement for active employees; any discrepancies between active employees and retirees; extent to wh ich participants are reasonably likely to withdraw support for the plan, resulting in accelerated employer withdrawal; and the extent to which the benets are attributed to service with an emp loyer that failed to pay its withdrawal liability. 4Avoidance of insolvency is determined by reference to section 418E under which a plan is insolvent if it is unable to pay scheduled benets for a year. Pu rsuant to section 432(e)(9)(E)(iv), this restriction does not apply to certain benet improvements if the Treasury Department determines either that the benet improvements are reason able and provide for only de minimis increases in plan liabilities or that the benet improvements are required as a condition of qualication or to comply with other applicable law. August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 136Participant vote on proposed benet reduction If a suspension application is approved, the proposed suspension then goes to avote of plan participants and beneciaries.See section 432(e)(9)(H). The vote will beadministered by the Treasury Department,in consultation with the PBGC and theLabor Department, within 30 days afterapproval of the suspension application.The plan sponsor is required to provide aballot for a vote (subject to approval bythe Treasury Department, in consultationwith the PBGC and the Labor Depart-ment). The statute species informationthat the ballot must include. 5If a majority of plan participants and beneciaries donot vote to reject the suspension, the stat-ute requires the Treasury Department toissue a nal authorization to suspend ben-ets within seven days after the vote. Explanation of Provisions I.Overview These proposed regulations provide guidance on certain requirements undersection 432(e)(9) regarding suspension ofbenets for multiemployer dened and declining status. Theproposed regulations cross-reference cer-tain requirements that are addressed in thetemporary regulations issued in the Rulesand Regulations section of this issue oftheFederal Register . In addition to the proposed and temporary regulations, theprocedural requirements for submitting anapplication to suspend benets, as well asa model notice, are provided in Rev. Proc.2015-34. II.General rules on suspension of benets Under the temporary regulations, once a plan is amended to suspend benets, aplan may pay or continue to pay a reducedlevel of benets pursuant to the suspen-sion only if the terms of the plan areconsistent with the requirements of sec-tion 432(e)(9) and the regulations. Theproposed regulations would provide that a plan's terms are consistent with the re-quirements of section 432(e)(9) even ifthey provide that, instead of a suspensionof benets occurring in full on a speciedeffective date, the amount of a suspensionwill phase in or otherwise change in adenite, pre-determined manner as of aspecied future effective date or dates.However, the proposed regulations wouldprovide that a plan's terms are inconsis-tent with the statutory requirements if theyprovide that the amount of a suspensionwill change contingent upon the occur-rence of any other specied future event,condition, or development. For example, aplan is not permitted to provide that anadditional or larger suspension of benetsis triggered if the plan's funded statusdeteriorates. Similarly, a plan is not per-mitted to provide that, contingent upon aspecied future event, condition, or devel-opment, a suspension of benets will beautomatically reduced (except upon a fail-ure to satisfy the annual requirement, de-scribed in the proposed regulations, thatthe plan sponsor determine that the plan isprojected to become insolvent unless ben-ets are suspended). In the case of an individual who has commenced benets, the proposed regula-tions provide that the effective date of asuspension of benets is the rst date as ofwhich a portion of the individual's bene-ts are not paid as a result of the suspen-sion. In the case of an individual who hasnot yet commenced benets, the effectivedate of a suspension of benets is the rstdate as of which the participant's accruedbenet is reduced as a result of the sus-pension. The effective date of a suspen-sion may not precede the date on which anal authorization to suspend benets isissued. If a suspension of benets provides for more than one reduction in benets overtime, such that benets are scheduled tobe reduced by an additional amount afterbenets are rst reduced pursuant to the suspension, then each date as of whichbenets are reduced is treated as a sepa-rate effective date of the suspension,which would require, for example, that the age-based limitation be separately appliedas of each effective date. However, if theeffective date of the nal scheduled reduc-tion in benets in a series of reductionspursuant to a suspension is less than threeyears after the effective date of the rstreduction, the effective date of the rstreduction will be treated as the effectivedate of all subsequent reductions pursuantto that suspension. For example, if a sus-pension provides that benets will be re-duced by a specied percentage effectiveJanuary 1, 2017, by an additional percent-age effective January 1, 2018, and by anadditional percentage effective January 1,2019, with no subsequent changes sched-uled, it would meet the three-year condi-tion to treat January 1, 2017 as the effec-tive date for all three reductions.However, if the suspension provided for afurther reduction effective January 1,2020, the suspension would not be treatedas satisfying the three-year condition andtherefore would be treated under the pro-posed regulations as having four separateeffective dates. III.Conditions for suspensions The regulations provide that a plan may not suspend benets unless the plansponsor makes initial and annual determi-nations that the plan is projected to be-come insolvent unless benets are sus-pended, although all reasonable measuresto avoid insolvency have been taken.These determinations are based on thenonexclusive list of factors described insection 432(e)(9)(C)(ii). Under the proposed regulations, a plan sponsor satises the annual-plan-sponsordeterminations requirement for a planyear only if the plan sponsor determines,no later than the last day of the plan year,that (1) all reasonable measures to avoidinsolvency have been taken, and (2) theplan is projected to become insolvent un-less the suspension of benets continues(or another suspension of benets undersection 432(e)(9) is implemented) for theplan. For this purpose, the projection of 5This information includes a statement from the plan sponsor in support of the suspension; a statement in opposition to the suspension compiled from co mments received in response to theFederal Register notice issued by Treasury within 30 days of receiving the suspension application; a statement that the suspension has been approved by the Secretary o f the Treasury, in consultation with the PBGC and the Secretary of Labor; a statement that the plan sponsor has determined that the plan will become insolvent unless th e suspension takes effect; a statement that insolvency of the plan could result in benets lower than benets paid under the suspension; and a statement that insolvency of the PBGC would resu lt in benets lower than benets otherwise paid in the case of plan insolvency. Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 137the plan's insolvency must be made using the standards that apply for purposes ofdetermining whether a suspension is suf-cient to avoid insolvency and not mate-rially in excess of the level needed toavoid insolvency that are described inparagraph IV.B.1 of this preamble. If there is favorable actuarial experi- ence so that the plan could avoid insol-vency even if the benet suspension werereduced (but not eliminated), the plansponsor may wish to adopt a benet in-crease that partially restores suspendedbenets in order to share that favorableexperience with the participants. The stat-ute contemplates this circumstance byproviding in section 432(e)(9)(E) the re-quirements for such a partial restoration ofsuspended benets and for other benetimprovements. Moreover, if favorable ac-tuarial experience would allow the plan toavoid insolvency if the benet suspensionwere eliminated entirely, the proposedregulations would require the plan spon-sor to eliminate the suspension. The proposed regulations provide that, in order to satisfy the annual-plan-sponsordeterminations requirement, the plansponsor must maintain a written record ofits annual determinations. The written re-cord must be included in an update to therehabilitation plan, whether or not there isotherwise an update for that year or, if theplan is no longer in critical status, in thedocuments under which the plain is main-tained (so that it is available to plan par-ticipants and beneciaries). The plansponsor's consideration of factors re-quired for its determination of whether all reasonable measures have been takenmust be reflected in that determination. If a plan sponsor fails to satisfy the annual-plan-sponsor determinations re-quirement for a plan year (including main-taining the written record), then the sus-pension of benets expires as of the rstday of the next plan year. For example, ifin a plan year the plan sponsor is unable todetermine that all reasonable measures toavoid insolvency have been taken, thenthe plan sponsor must take those addi-tional reasonable measures before the endof the plan year in order to avoid theexpiration of the suspension as of the rstday of the next plan year.IV.Limitations on suspensions The proposed and temporary regula- tions reflect the individual and aggregatelimitations on a suspension of benets un-der section 432(e)(9)(D). 6The temporary regulations provide that after applying theindividual limitations, the overall size anddistribution of the suspension is subject tothe aggregate limitations. A.Individual limitations 1.Guarantee-based limitation The temporary regulations provide that benets may not be suspended below 110percent of the monthly benet payable toa participant, beneciaries, or alternatepayee that would be guaranteed by thePBGC under section 4022A of ERISA ifthe plan were to become insolvent as ofthe effective date of the suspension. The proposed regulations provide that under section 4022A of ERISA, themonthly benet of a participant or bene-ciary that would be guaranteed by thePBGC with respect to a plan if the planwere to become insolvent as of the effec-tive date of the suspension is generallybased on section 4022A(c)(1) of ERISA.Under section 4022A(c)(1) of ERISA, thatguaranteed amount is a dollar amountmultiplied by the participant's years andmonths of credited service as of the dateas of which the guarantee is determined.The dollar amount is 100 percent of theaccrual rate up to $11, plus 75 percent ofthe lesser of (1) $33, or (2) the accrualrate, if any, in excess of $11. The accrualrate is a participant's or beneciary'smonthly benet (described in section4022A(c)(2)(A) of ERISA) by the partic-ipant's years of credited service (de-scribed in section 4022A(c)(3) of ERISA)as of the effective date of the suspension. The proposed regulations provide a number of examples of how the PBGCguarantee is calculated. These examplesreflect the interpretation of section 4022Aof ERISA provided by the PBGC. In determining the participant's monthly benet for purposes of the ac-crual rate, only nonforfeitable benets(other than benets that become nonfor-feitable on account of plan termination) are taken into account, pursuant to section4022A(a) of ERISA. The proposed regu-lations treat benets that are forfeitable onthe effective date of a suspension as non-forfeitable, provided that the participant isin covered employment on that date andwould have a nonforfeitable right to thosebenets upon completion of vesting ser-vice following that date. For example, ifan active participant had only three out ofve years necessary for the participant'sbenet to become 100 percent vested un-der a plan as of the effective date of asuspension, the participant's accrued ben-et will be treated as 100 percent vestedas of that date. 2.Disability-based limitation The temporary regulations incorporate the statutory requirement that benetsbased on disability may not be suspended.For this purpose, disability is dened inaccordance with the denition of that termin the plan. The proposed regulationswould provide rules for implementing thislimitation. The proposed regulations provide that benets based on disability means the en-tire amount paid to a participant pursuantto the participant becoming disabled, re-gardless of whether a portion of thatamount would have been paid if the par-ticipant had not become disabled. For ex-ample, assume that a participant with anaccrued benet of $1,000 per month, pay-able at age 65, becomes entitled under theplan to an early retirement benet at age55 on account of a disability (as dened inthe plan). Under the plan, the participant(absent disability) would be entitled to areduced early retirement benet of $600per month commencing at age 55, but thereduction for early retirement does notapply because the participant became en-titled to a benet on account of a disabil-ity. The participant's disability benetpayment of $1,000 per month commenc-ing at age 55 is a benet based on disabil-ity, even though the participant wouldhave received a portion of these benets atretirement regardless of the disability. The proposed regulations also provide that if a participant begins receiving an 6The temporary regulations refer to section 432(e)(9)(D)(vii) for additional rules applicable to certain plans. August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 138auxiliary or other temporary disability benet and the sole reason the participantceases receiving that benet is com-mencement of retirement benets, thebenet based on disability after com-mencement of retirement benets is thelesser of (1) the periodic payment the par-ticipant was receiving immediately beforethe participant's retirement benets com-menced, or (2) the total periodic paymentsto the participant under the plan. For example, assume that a participant begins receiving a disability pension of$1,000 per month payable at age 55.When the participant reaches age 65, theparticipant's disability pension is discon-tinued and the participant elects to com-mence payment of the participant's ac-crued benet in the form of an actuariallyequivalent joint and survivor annuity pay-able in the amount of $850 per month.Before age 65, the participant's benetbased on disability is $1,000 per month.After age 65, the participant's benetbased on disability is $850 per month.(Alternatively, if the participant hadelected to commence payment of the par-ticipant's accrued benet in the form of asingle life annuity payable in the amountof $1,000 per month, the participant'sbenet based on disability after age 65would be $1,000 per month.) A suspen-sion of benets is not permitted to applyto any portion of those benets at anytime. 3.Age-based limitation The proposed regulations would pro- vide that no suspension of benets is per-mitted to apply to a participant, bene-ciary, or alternate payee who hascommenced receiving benets as of theeffective date of the suspension and hasreached age 80 no later than the end of themonth that includes the effective date ofthe suspension. For example, assume thata suspension of benets has an effectivedate of December 1, 2017. If a retiree is79 years old on December 1, 2017, andturns 80 on December 15, 2017, a suspen-sion of benets is not permitted to applyto the retiree's monthly benet. In addition, no more than the applica- ble percentage of the maximum suspend-able benet may be suspended for a par-ticipant, beneciary, or alternate payeewho has commenced receiving benets as of the effective date of the suspension andhas reached age 75 by the end of themonth that includes the effective date ofthe suspension. The maximum suspendable benet is the portion of an individual's benets thatwould be suspended without regard to theage-based limitation, after the applicationof the guarantee-based limitation and thedisability-based limitation, described ear-lier in paragraphs IV.A.1 and IV.A.2 ofthis preamble. The applicable percentage is the per- centage obtained by dividing: (1) thenumber of months during the period be-ginning with the month after the month inwhich the suspension of benets is effec-tive and ending with the month duringwhich the participant or beneciary at-tains the age of 80, by (2) 60. The proposed regulations explain how to apply the age-based limitation if bene-ts have not commenced to either a par-ticipant or beneciary as of the effective date of the suspension. If the participant isalive on the effective date, the participantis treated as having commenced benetson that date. If the participant is deceasedon the effective date, the beneciary istreated as having commenced benets onthat date. The age-based limitation applies to a suspension of benets in which an alter-nate payee has an interest, whether or notthe alternate payee has commenced bene-ts as of the effective date of the suspen-sion. If the alternate payee's right to thesuspended benets derives from a quali-ed domestic relations order within themeaning of section 414(p)(1)(A) (QDRO)under which the alternate payee shares ineach benet payment but the participantretains the right to choose the time andform of payment with respect to the ben-et to which the suspension applies(shared payment QDRO), the applicablepercentage for the alternate payee is cal-culated by using the participant's age as ofthe effective date of the suspension. If thealternate payee's right to the suspendedbenets derives from a QDRO underwhich the alternate payee has a separateright to receive a portion of the partici-pant's retirement benet to be paid at atime and in a form different from thatchosen by the participant (separate inter-est QDRO), the applicable percentage for the alternate payee is calculated by sub-stituting the alternate payee's age as of theeffective date of the suspension for theparticipant's age. If the age-based limitation applies to a participant on the effective date of thesuspension, then the age-based limitationalso applies to the beneciary of the par-ticipant, based on the age of the partici-pant on the effective date of the suspen-sion. B. Aggregate limitations 1. Avoidance of insolvency The proposed regulations reflect the re- quirement in section 432(e)(9)(D)(iv) thatany suspension of benets, in the aggre-gate (considered, if applicable, in combi-nation with a partition of the plan), mustbe at a level that is reasonably estimatedto enable the plan to avoid insolvency andnot materially exceed the level that is nec-essary to enable the plan to avoid insol-vency. A suspension of benets (considered, if applicable, in combination with a partitionof the plan) will satisfy the requirementthat it is at a level that is reasonably esti-mated to enable the plan to avoid insol-vency if: (1) for each plan year throughoutan extended period beginning on the rstday of the plan year that includes theeffective date of the suspension, the plan'ssolvency ratio is projected on a determin-istic basis to be at least 1.0; (2) based onstochastic projections reflecting variancein investment return, the probability thatthe plan will avoid insolvency throughoutthe extended period is more than 50 per-cent; and (3) unless the plan's projectedfunded percentage (within the meaning ofsection 432(j)(2)) at the end of the ex-tended period using a deterministic pro-jection exceeds 100 percent, then the pro-jection shows that at all times during thelast ve plan years of that period, there isno projected decrease in either the plan'ssolvency ratio or its available resources(as dened in section 418E(b)(3)). In thecase of a plan that is not large enough tobe required to select a retiree representa-tive, the determination of whether a ben-et suspension (considered, if applicable,in combination with a plan partition) will Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 139satisfy the requirement that it is at a level that is reasonably estimated to enable theplan to avoid insolvency is permitted to bemade without regard to clause (2). A plan's solvency ratio for a plan year means the ratio of the plan's availableresources (as dened in section418E(b)(3)) for the plan year to the sched-uled benet payments under the plan forthe plan year. An extended period means aperiod of at least 30 plan years. However,in the case of a temporary suspension ofbenets that is scheduled to cease as of adate that is more than 25 years after theeffective date of the suspension, the ex-tended period must be lengthened so thatit ends no earlier than ve plan years afterthe cessation of the suspension. Under the proposed regulations, a sus- pension of benets will satisfy the re-quirement that the suspension be at a levelthat is reasonably estimated to not mate-rially exceed the level necessary for theplan to avoid insolvency if an alternative,similar but smaller suspension of benets, under which the dollar amount of the sus-pension for each participant and bene-ciary were reduced by ve percent, wouldnot be sufcient to enable the plan tosatisfy the requirement that the suspensionbe at a level that is reasonably estimatedto enable the plan to avoid insolvency. Inaddition, if the PBGC issues an order par-titioning the plan, then a suspension ofbenets with respect to the plan will bedeemed to satisfy this requirement. Thistest based on a ve percent reduction of asuspension is roughly comparable to thecommon use in accounting standards of ave-percent threshold for materiality. The proposed regulations would re- quire the actuarial projections used forpurposes of these requirements to reflectthe assumption that the suspension of ben-ets continues indenitely (or, if the sus-pension expires on a specied date by itsown terms, until that date). The actuarialassumptions and methods used for the ac-tuarial projections must be reasonable inaccordance with the rules of section431(c)(3). The actuary's selection of as-sumptions about future covered employ-ment and contribution levels (includingcontribution base units and average con-tribution rate) is permitted to be based oninformation provided by the plan sponsor,which must act in good faith in providingthe information. In addition, to the extent that the actuarial assumptions used for theprojections differ from those used to cer-tify whether the plan is in critical anddeclining status pursuant to section432(b)(3)(B)(iv), a justication for thatdifference generally must be provided. The cash flow projections must be based on the fair market value of assets asof the end of the most recent calendarquarter, projected benet payments thatare consistent with the projected benetpayments under the most recent actuarialvaluation, and appropriate adjustments toprojected benet payments to include ben-ets for new hires who are reflected in theprojected contribution amounts. The pro-jected cash flows relating to contributions,withdrawal liability payments, and benetpayments must also be adjusted to reflectsignicant events that occurred after themost recent actuarial valuation. Signi-cant events include: (1) a plan merger ortransfer; (2) the withdrawal or the additionof employers that changed projected cash flows relating to contributions, with-drawal liability payments, or benet pay-ments by more than ve percent; (3) aplan amendment, a change in a collectivebargaining agreement, or a change in arehabilitation plan that changed projectedcash flows relating to contributions, with-drawal liability, or benet payments bymore than ve percent; or (4) any otherevent or trend that resulted in a materialchange in the projected cash flows. The application for suspension must include a disclosure of the total contribu-tions, total contribution base units and av-erage contribution rate, withdrawal liabil-ity payments, and the rate of return onplan assets for each of the 10 plan yearspreceding the plan year in which the ap-plication is submitted. In addition, the ap-plication must include deterministic pro-jections of the plan's solvency ratio overthe extended period using two alternativeassumptions that the plan's future rate ofreturn was lower than the assumed rate ofreturn by (1) one percentage point and (2)two percentage points. The application must include determin- istic projections of the plan's solvencyratio over the extended period using twoalternative assumptions for the future con-tribution base units. These alternatives arethat the future contribution base units (1)continue under the same trend as the plan experienced over the past 10 years, and(2) continue under that 10-year trend re-duced by one percentage point. The application must include an illus- tration, prepared on a deterministic basis,of the projected value of plan assets, theaccrued liability of the plan (calculatedusing the unit credit funding method), andthe funded percentage for each year in theextended period. 2.Equitable distribution The proposed regulations would re- quire any suspension of benets to beequitably distributed across the participantand beneciary population. If a suspen-sion of benets applies differently to dif-ferent categories or groups of participantsand beneciaries, then the suspension ofbenets is equitably distributed across theparticipant and beneciary populationonly if under the suspension: (1) withineach such category or group, the individ-uals are treated consistently; (2) any dif-ference in treatment among the differentcategories or groups is based on relevantfactors reasonably selected by the plansponsor; and (3) any such difference intreatment is based on a reasonable appli-cation of the relevant factors. The proposed regulations contain ex- amples illustrating the equitable distribu-tion rules. V.Benet improvements The proposed regulations set forth rules for the application of section432(e)(9)(E), regarding benet improve-ments. The proposed regulations providethat a plan satises the criteria in section432(e)(9)(E) only if, during the period thatany suspension of benets remains in ef-fect, the plan sponsor does not implementany benet improvement except as pro-vided in the proposed regulations. Section 432(e)(9)(E)(vi) and the pro- posed regulations dene the term benetimprovement to mean, with respect to aplan, a resumption of suspended benets,an increase in benets, an increase in therate at which benets accrue, or an in-crease in the rate at which benets be-come nonforfeitable under the plan. In thecase of a suspension of benets that ex- August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 140pires as of a date that is specied in the original plan amendment providing for thesuspension, the resumption of benetssolely from the expiration of that period isnot treated as a benet improvement. A.Limitations on benet improvements for those not in pay status The proposed regulations provide that, during the period any suspension of ben-ets under a plan remains in effect, theplan sponsor may not increase the liabili-ties of the plan by reason of any benetimprovement for any participant or bene- ciary who was not in pay status for anyplan year before the plan year for whichthe benet improvement takes effect, un-less several conditions are satised. One condition is that the present value of the total liabilities for a benet im-provement for participants and benecia-ries whose benet commencement datesoccurred before the rst day of the planyear for which the benet improvementtakes effect is not less than the presentvalue of the total liabilities for a benetimprovement for participants and bene-ciaries who were not in pay status by thatdate. For this purpose, present value is thepresent value as of the rst day of the planyear in which the benet improvement isproposed to take effect, using actuarialassumptions in accordance with section431. The plan sponsor must also equitably distribute the benet improvement amongparticipants and beneciaries whose ben-et commencement dates occurred beforethe rst day of the plan year in which thebenet improvement is proposed to takeeffect. The evaluation of whether a benetimprovement is equitably distributed musttake into account the factors relevant towhether a suspension of benets is equi-tably distributed, described in paragraphIV.B.2 of this preamble, and the extent towhich the benets of the participants andbeneciaries were suspended. In addition, the plan actuary must cer- tify that, after taking into account the ben-et improvement, the plan is projected toavoid insolvency indenitely. This certi-cation must be made using the standardsthat apply for purposes of determiningwhether a suspension is sufcient to avoidinsolvency that are described in paragraph IV.B.1 of this preamble. These limitations do not apply to a resumption of suspended benets or planamendment that increases liabilities withrespect to participants and beneciariesnot in pay status by the rst day of theplan year in which the benet improve-ment took effect that: (1) the TreasuryDepartment, in consultation with thePBGC and the Labor Department, deter-mines to be reasonable and which pro-vides for only de minimis increases inplan liabilities, or (2) is required as acondition of qualication under section401 or to comply with other applicablelaw, as determined by the Treasury De-partment. B.Limitations on benet improvements for those in pay status Under the proposed regulations, the plan sponsor may increase liabilities ofthe plan by eliminating some or all of thesuspension that applies solely to partici-pants and beneciaries in pay status at thetime of the resumption, provided that theplan sponsor equitably distributes thevalue of those resumed benets amongparticipants and beneciaries in pay sta-tus, taking into account factors relevant towhether a suspension of benets is equi-tably distributed. Such a resumption ofbenets is not subject to the limitations ona benet improvement under section432(f) (relating to restrictions on benetincreases for plans in critical status). C.Other limitations on benet increases The proposed regulations would pro- vide that the limitations on benet im-provements generally apply in addition toother limitations on benet increases thatapply to a plan. Except for a resumption ofsuspended benets described in paragraphV.B. of this preamble, the limitations on abenet improvement are in addition to thelimitations in section 432(f) and any otherapplicable limitations on increases in ben-ets imposed on a plan. VI.Notice of proposed suspension Section 432(e)(9)(F)(iii) states that no- tice must be provided in a form and man-ner prescribed in guidance and that notice may be provided in written, electronic, orother appropriate form to the extent suchform is reasonably accessible to personsto whom the notice is required to be pro-vided. The temporary regulations includerules implementing the statutory noticerequirements in section 432(e)(9)(F). Theproposed regulations would provide thatnotice must exclusively be provided inwritten or electronic form (that is, there isno other appropriate form). VII. Approval or denial of an application for suspension of benets A plan sponsor cannot implement a suspension of benets unless, amongother things, its application for a proposedsuspension of benets is approved. Thetemporary regulations contain rules re-garding the submission and review of anapplication, and related guidelines andprocedures are set forth in Rev. Proc.2015-34. The temporary regulations pro-vide that a complete application will bedeemed approved unless, within 225 daysafter a complete application is received,the Treasury Department noties the plansponsor that its application does not sat-isfy one or more of the requirements forapproval. The proposed regulations wouldprovide that, if necessary under the cir-cumstances, the Treasury Department andthe plan sponsor may mutually agree inwriting to stay the 225-day period. Anysuch agreement would be expected to beused only in unusual circumstances. As required by section 432(e)(9)(G)(iv), the proposed regulations provide that inevaluating whether the plan sponsor hassatised the condition (in section432(e)(9)(C)(ii)) that it determine that allreasonable measures to avoid insolvencywithin the meaning of section 418E havebeen taken, the Treasury Department, inconsultation with the PBGC and the LaborDepartment, will review the plan spon-sor's consideration of each of the factorsenumerated in section 432(e)(9)(C)(ii)and each other factor it took into accountin making that determination. The pro-posed regulations, like the statute, do notrequire the plan sponsor to take any par-ticular measure or measures to avoid in-solvency but do require, in the aggregate,that the plan sponsor take all reasonable Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 141measures to avoid insolvency. In accor- dance with section 432(e)(9)(G)(v), theproposed regulations provide that, in eval-uating the plan sponsor's application, theTreasury Department will accept the plansponsor's determinations under section432(e)(9)(C)(ii) unless the Treasury De-partment concludes, in consultation withthe PBGC and the Labor Department, thatthe determinations were clearly erroneous.This statutory structure reflects the viewthat particular measures to avoid insol-vency may be inappropriate for someplans and requires the Treasury Depart-ment to review the plan sponsor's consid-eration of the appropriateness of each ofthe statutory factors, but recognizes thatthe plan sponsor is generally in a betterposition than the Treasury Department todetermine the most effective measuresthat a particular plan should take to avoidinsolvency. The proposed regulations provide that an application to suspend benets will notbe approved unless the plan sponsor cer-ties that, if it receives nal authorizationto suspend benets (described in para-graph VIII. of this preamble), chooses toimplement the suspension, and adopts aplan amendment to implement the suspen-sion, it will timely amend the plan toprovide that (1) the suspension of benetswill cease as of the rst day of the rstplan year following the rst plan year inwhich the plan sponsor fails to make theannual determinations in section432(e)(9)(C)(ii); and (2) any future benetimprovement must satisfy the section432(e)(9)(E) rules for benet improve-ments. VIII. Participant vote on proposed benet reduction Section 432(e)(9)(H)(ii) provides that if an application for a suspension of ben-ets is approved, then the Treasury De-partment, in consultation with the PBGCand the Labor Department, will administera vote of all plan participants and all ben-eciaries of deceased participants (eligi-ble voters). Any suspension of benetswill take effect only after the vote andafter a nal authorization to suspend ben-ets. Many of the rules relating to the voteare set forth in the temporary regulations. However, both the temporary and the pro-posed regulations reserve, for later issu-ance, provisions on the administration ofthe vote. The proposed regulations would pro- vide that if an application for suspensionis approved, the plan sponsor must takereasonable steps to inform eligible votersabout the proposed suspension and thevote. This includes all eligible voters whocan be contacted by reasonable effortspursuant to section 432(e)(9)(F). Anyonewhom the plan sponsor has been able tolocate through these means (or who hasotherwise been located by the plan spon-sor) must be sent a ballot. The proposed regulations would re- quire the plan sponsor to provide a ballotfor the vote 7that includes the following: A description of the proposed suspen- sion and its effect, including the effectof the suspension on each category orgroup of individuals affected by thesuspension and the extent to whichthey are affected; A description of the factors considered by the plan sponsor in designing thebenet suspension, including but notlimited to the factors in section432(e)(9)(D)(vi); A description of whether the suspen- sion will remain in effect indenitelyor will expire by its own terms (and, ifit will expire by its own terms, whenthat will occur); A statement from the plan sponsor in support of the proposed suspension; A statement in opposition to the pro- posed suspension compiled from com-ments received pursuant to the solici-tation of comments in the Federal Register notice with respect to the ap- plication; A statement that the proposed suspen- sion has been approved by the Secre-tary of the Treasury, in consultationwith the PBGC and the Secretary ofLabor; A statement that the plan sponsor has determined that the plan will becomeinsolvent unless the proposed suspen-sion takes effect (including the year inwhich insolvency is projected to occurwithout a suspension of benets), and an accompanying statement that thisdetermination is subject to uncertainty; A statement that insolvency of the plan could result in benets lower than ben-ets paid under the proposed suspen-sion and a description of the projectedbenet payments in the event of planinsolvency; A statement that insolvency of the PBGC would result in benets lowerthan benets otherwise paid in the caseof plan insolvency; A statement that the plan's actuary has certied that the plan is projected toavoid insolvency, taking into accountthe proposed suspension of benets(and, if applicable, a proposed parti-tion plan), and an accompanying state-ment that the actuary's projection issubject to uncertainty; A statement that the suspension will go into effect unless a majority of eli-gible voters vote to reject the suspen-sion and that, therefore, a failure tovote has the same effect on the out-come of the vote as a vote in favor ofthe suspension; A copy of the individualized esti- mate that was provided as part ofthe earlier notice described in section432(e)(9)(F) (or, if that individualizedestimate is no longer accurate, a cor-rected version of that estimate); and A description of the voting procedures, including the deadline for voting. A proposed suspension is generally permitted to be implemented unless re-jected by a majority vote of all eligiblevoters. In determining whether a major-ity of all eligible voters have voted toreject the suspension under section432(e)(9)(H)(ii), the proposed regula-tions would treat any eligible voters towhom ballots have not been provided(because the individuals could not belocated) as voting to reject the suspen-sion at the same rate (in other words, inthe same percentage) as those to whomballots have been provided. Proposed Effective Date These regulations are proposed to be effective on and after the date of publica- 7The ballot is subject to approval by the Treasury Department, in consultation with the PBGC and the Labor Department.

Special Analyses Certain IRS regulations, including this one, are exempt from the requirements ofExecutive Order 12866, as supplementedand reafrmed by Executive Order 13563.Therefore, a regulatory impact assessmentis not required. It also has been deter-mined that section 553(b) of the Admin-istrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter5) does not apply to these regulations. The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) requires an agency toconsider whether the rules it proposes willhave a signicant economic impact on asubstantial number of small entities. Inthis case, the IRS and Treasury believethat the regulations likely would not havea \"signicant economic impact on a sub-stantial number of small entities.\" 5U.S.C. 605. This certication is based onthe fact that the number of small entitiesaffected by this rule is unlikely to be sub-stantial because it is unlikely that a sub-stantial number of small multiemployerplans in critical and declining status willsuspend benets under section 432(e)(9).Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code,this notice of proposed rulemaking hasbeen submitted to the Chief Counsel ofAdvocacy of the Small Business Admin-istration for comment on its impact onsmall business. Comments and Public Hearing Before these proposed regulations are adopted as nal regulations, considerationwill be given to any comments that aresubmitted timely to the Treasury Depart-ment and the IRS as prescribed in thispreamble under the \"Addresses\" heading. The Treasury Department and the IRS re-quest comments on all aspects of the pro-posed rules (including both the provisionsset forth in this notice of proposed rule-making and the provisions set forth in thecross-referenced temporary regulations).Comments are specically requested onthe demonstration of avoidance of insol-vency, including the rules related to theuse of the extended period for this pur-pose. In addition, comments are requestedon the rules relating to the demonstrationthat the suspension is not materially inexcess of the level necessary to avoid in-solvency. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying at www-.regulations.gov or upon request. Please Note: All comments will be made avail- able to the public. Do not include anypersonally identiable information (suchas Social Security number, name, address,or other contact information) or conden-tial business information that you do notwant publicly disclosed. All commentsmay be posted on the Internet and can beretrieved by most Internet search engines. A public hearing on these proposed regulations has been scheduled for Sep-tember 10, 2015, beginning at 9:00 a.m. inthe Amphitheater of the Ronald ReaganBuilding and International Trade Center,1300 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washing-ton, D.C.

The authority citation for part 1 continues to read in part as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 780 5*** Par. 2. Section added to read as follows: \u00a7 1.432(e)(9)-1 Benet for multiemployer plans in . (a)General rules on suspension of ben- ets\u2014(1) General rule . [The text of the proposed amendments to \u00a7 1.432(e)(9)-1(a)(1) is the same as \u00a7 1.432(e)(9)-1T(a)(1) published elsewhere in this issueof the Federal Register .] (2)Adoption of plan terms inconsistent with suspension requirements \u2014(i) Gen- eral rule . [The text of 1.432(e)(9)-1(a)(2)(i) isthe same as \u00a7 1.432(e)(9)-1T(a)(2)(i) pub-lished elsewhere issue of the Fed- eral Register .] (ii)Changes in level of suspension .A plan's terms are consistent with the re-quirements of section 432(e)(9) even ifthe plan provides that, instead of a sus-pension of benets occurring in full on aspecied effective date, the amount of asuspension will phase in or otherwisechange in a denite, pre-determined man-ner as of a specied future effective dateor dates. However, a plan's terms are in-consistent with the requirements of sec-tion 432(e)(9) if they provide that theamount of a suspension will change con-tingent upon the occurrence of any otherspecied future event, condition, or devel-opment. For example, a plan is not per-mitted to provide that an additional orlarger suspension of benets is triggered ifthe plan's funded status deteriorates. Sim- Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 143ilarly, a plan is not permitted to provide that, contingent upon a specied futureevent, condition, or development, a sus-pension of benets will be automaticallyreduced (except upon a failure to satisfythe annual requirement, described in para-graph (c)(4) of this section, that the plansponsor make determinations that the planis projected to avoid insolvency unlessbenets are suspended). (3)Organization of the regulation . This paragraph (a) contains denitionsand general rules relating to a suspensionof benets by a multiemployer plan undersection 432(e)(9). Paragraph (b) of thissection denes a suspension of benetsand describes the length of a suspension,the treatment of beneciaries and alternatepayees under this section, and the require-ment to select a retiree representative.Paragraph (c) of this section contains rulesfor the actuarial certication and plan-sponsor determinations that must be madein order for a plan to suspend benets.Paragraph (d) of this section describes limitations on suspensions of benets.Paragraph (e) of this section describeslimitations on benet improvements thatmay be made while a suspension of ben-ets is in effect. Paragraph (f) of thissection describes the requirement to pro-vide notice in connection with an applica-tion to suspend benets. Paragraph (g) ofthis section describes the approval or de-nial of an application for a suspension ofbenets. Paragraph (h) of this section con-tains certain rules relating to the vote onan approved suspension, systemically im-portant plans, and the issuance of a nalauthorization to suspend benets. (4)Denitions . The following deni- for purposes of this section\u2014(i)Pay status . [The text of the proposed 1.432(e)(9)-1(a)(4)(i) isthe same as \u00a7 1.432(e)(9)-1T(a)(4)(i) pub-lished elsewhere the Fed- eral Register .] (ii)Plan sponsor . [The text of the pro- posed amendments to \u00a7 1.432(e)(9)-1(a)(4)(ii) is the same as \u00a7 1.432(e)(9)-1T(a)(4)(ii) published elsewhere in thisissue of the Federal Register .] (iii) Effective date of suspension of benets \u2014(A) In general . In the case of an individual who has commenced benets,the effective date of a suspension of ben-ets is the rst date as of which a portionof the individual's benets are not paid as a result of the suspension. In the case of anindividual who has not yet commencedbenets, the effective date of a suspensionof benets is the rst date as of which theindividual's accrued benet is reduced asa result of the suspension. (B)Phased-in suspension . If a suspen- sion of benets provides more thanone reduction in benets over time, suchthat benets are scheduled to be reducedby an additional amount after benets arerst reduced pursuant to the suspension,then each date as of which benets arereduced is treated as a separate effectivedate of the suspension. However, if theeffective date of the nal scheduled reduc-tion in benets in a series of reductionspursuant to a suspension is less than threeyears later than the effective date of therst reduction, the effective date of therst reduction will be treated as the effec-tive date of all subsequent reductions pur-suant to that suspension. (C)Effective date may not be retroac- tive. The effective date of a suspension may not precede the date on which a nalauthorization to suspend benets is issuedpursuant to paragraph (h)(6) of this sec-tion.

Under section 4022A of the Employee Retirement In-come Security Act of 1974, Public Law93-406 (88 Stat. 829 (1974)), as amended(ERISA), the monthly benet of a partic-ipant or beneciary that would be guaran-teed by the Pension Benet Guaranty Cor-poration (PBGC) with respect to a plan ifthe plan were to become insolvent as ofthe effective date of the suspension is gen-erally based on section 4022A(c)(1) ofERISA. Under that section, the monthlybenet that would be guaranteed if the plan were to become insolvent as of thedate as of which the guarantee is deter-mined is the product of\u2014 (A) 100 percent of the accrual rate up to $11, plus 75 percent of the lesser of\u2014 (1) $33; or (2) The accrual rate, if any, in excess of $11; and (B) The number of the participant's years and months of credited service as ofthat date. (iii) Calculation of accrual rate . The accrual rate, as dened in section4022A(c)(2) of ERISA, is calculated bydividing\u2014 (A) The or beneciary's monthly benet, described in section4022A(c)(2)(A) of ERISA; by (B) The participant's years of credited service, described in section 4022A(c)(3)of ERISA, as of the effective date of thesuspension. (iv)Special rule for non-vested partic- ipants ben-ets under section 4022A(a) of ERISAinclude benets that are forfeitable as ofthe effective date of the suspension, pro-vided that the participant would have anonforfeitable right to those benets if theparticipant continued to earn vesting ser-vice following that date.(v)Examples . The following examples illustrate the limitation on a suspension ofbenets in this paragraph (d)(2). Unlessotherwise stated, the amount of guaranteepayable by PBGC in these examples isbased on section 4022A(c) of ERISA, rules (guarantee for benets accrued asof July 30, 1980) do not apply. In theseexamples, unless otherwise stated, themonthly benets are nonforfeitable, arebased on benets that have been in effectfor at least 60 months as of the effectivedate of the suspension, and are no greaterthan the monthly benet that would bepayable at normal retirement age in theform of a single life annuity. Example 1 . (i)Facts . A participant is receiving a benet of $1,500 per month. The participant has 30years of credited service under the plan. (ii)Calculation of accrual rate . The participant's accrual rate is $50, calculated by dividing the par-ticipant's monthly benet payment ($1,500) by theparticipant's years of credited service (30). (iii) Calculation of monthly PBGC-guaranteed benet . The rst $11 of the accrual rate is fully guaranteed, and the next $33 of the accrual rate is 75% guaranteed ($33 x .75 /H11005$24.75). The partici- pant's monthly service is $35.75 ($11 /H11001$24.75/H11005$35.75). The PBGC guarantee formula is then applied to producethe amount of guarantee payable by PBGC, which is$1,072.50 ($35.75 x 30 years /H11005$1,072.50). (iv)Calculation of guarantee-based limitation .A suspension of benets may not reduce the partici-pant's benets below the guarantee-based limitation,which is equal to 110% of the amount of guaranteepayable by PBGC. That monthly amount is$1,179.75 ($1,072.50 x 1.1 /H11005$1,179.75). Example 2 . (i)Facts . The facts are the same as in Example 1 , except that the participant is deceased and the participant's beneciary is receiving amonthly benet of $750 under a 50% joint andsurvivor annuity. (ii)Calculation of accrual rate . The benecia- ry's accrual rate is $25, calculated by dividing thebeneciary's monthly benet payment ($750) by theparticipant's years of credited service (30). (iii) Calculation of monthly PBGC-guaranteed benet . The rst $11 of the accrual rate is fully guaranteed, and the next $14 ($25 - $11 /H11005$14) of the accrual rate guaranteed ($14 x .75 /H11005 $10.50). The beneciary's monthly guaranteed ben-et $21.50 of credited service ($11 /H11001 $10.50/H11005$21.50). The PBGC guarantee formula is then applied to produce the amount of guaranteepayable by PBGC, which is $645 ($21.50 x 30 years/H11005$645). (iv)Calculation of guarantee-based limitation .A suspension of benets may not reduce the benecia-ry's benets below the guarantee-based limitation, which is equal to 110% of the monthly amount ofguarantee payable by PBGC. That monthlyguarantee-based limitation amount is $709.50 ($645x 1.1/H11005$709.50). Example 3 . (i) Facts . A participant would be eligible for a monthly benet of $1,000 payable as asingle life annuity at normal retirement age, based onthe participant's 25 years of credited service. Theplan also permits a participant to receive a benet onan unreduced basis as a single life annuity at earlyretirement age and permits participants to receive anearly retirement benet in the form of a Social Se-curity level income option. Under the Social Securitylevel income option, the participant receives amonthly benet of $1,600 prior to normal retirementage (which is the plan's assumed Social Securityretirement age) and $900 after normal retirementage. (ii)Calculation of accrual rate . For purposes of calculating the accrual rate, the monthly benet thatis used to calculate the PBGC guarantee does notexceed the monthly benet of $1,000 that would bepayable at normal retirement age. In calculating theaccrual rate, the amount of guarantee payable byPBGC would be based on a monthly benet of$1,000 prior to normal retirement age and $900 afternormal retirement age. Before normal retirementage, the participant's accrual $40, determinedby dividing the participant's monthly benet pay-ment ($1,000) by years of credited service (25).After normal retirement age, the participant's accrualrate is $36, calculated by dividing the participant's monthly benet payment ($900) by the participant'syears of credited service (25). (iii) Calculation of monthly PBGC-guaranteed benet . Before normal retirement age, the rst $11 of the accrual rate is fully guaranteed, and the next $29of the accrual rate is 75% guaranteed ($29 x .75 /H11005 $21.75). The participant's monthly guaranteed ben-et year service is $32.75 ($11 /H11001 $21.75/H11005$32.75). The PBGC guarantee formula is then applied to produce the amount of guaranteepayable by PBGC, which is $818.75 ($32.75 x 25years/H11005$818.75). After normal retirement age, the rst $11 of the accrual rate is fully guaranteed, andthe next $25 of the accrual rate is 75% guaranteed($25 x .75 /H11005$18.75). The participant's monthly guaranteed benet is$29.75 ($11 /H11001$18.75/H11005$29.75). The PBGC guar- antee formula is then applied to produce the amountof guarantee payable by PBGC, which is $743.75after normal retirement age ($29.75 x 25 years /H11005 $743.75). (iv)Calculation of guarantee-based limitation .A suspension of benets not reduce the partici-pant's benets below the guarantee-based limitation,which is equal to 110% of the monthly amount ofguarantee payable by PBGC. That monthlyguarantee-based limitation amount is $900.63($818.75 x 1.1 /H11005$900.63) before normal retirement age and $818.13 ($743.75 x 1.1 /H11005$818.13) after normal retirement age. Example 4 . (i) Facts. A participant would be eligible for a monthly benet of $1,000 payable as asingle life annuity at normal retirement age, based onthe participant's 20 years of credited service. Theplan provides an actuarial increase for delaying ben- Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 145ets until after normal retirement age. The partici- pant delays commencement of benets until afternormal retirement age and the participant's monthlybenet is $1,200 instead of $1,000. (ii)Calculation of accrual rate . For purposes of calculating the accrual rate, the monthly benet thatis used to calculate the PBGC guarantee does notexceed the monthly benet of $1,000 that would bepayable at normal retirement age. Thus, in determin-ing the accrual rate, the PBGC guarantee would bebased on a monthly benet of $1,000, whether ben-ets are paid at or after normal retirement age. Theparticipant's accrual rate is $50, calculated by divid-ing the participant's monthly benet payment($1,000) by the participant's years of credited ser-vice (20). (iii) Calculation of monthly PBGC-guaranteed benet . The rst $11 of the accrual rate is fully guaranteed, and the next $33 of the accrual rate is75% guaranteed ($33 x .75 /H11005$24.75). The partici- pant's monthly service is $35.75 ($11 /H11001$24.75/H11005$35.75). The PBGC guarantee formula is then applied to producethe amount of guarantee payable by PBGC, which is$715 ($35.75 x 20 years /H11005$715). (iv)Calculation of guarantee-based limitation .A suspension of benets may not reduce the partici-pant's benets below the guarantee-based limitation,which is equal to 110% of the monthly amount ofguarantee payable by PBGC. That monthlyguarantee-based limitation amount is $786.50 ($715x 1.1/H11005$786.50). Example 5 . (i) Facts. A plan provides that a participant who has completed at least ve years ofservice will have a nonforfeitable right to 100% ofan accrued benet (and will not have a nonforfeit-able right to any portion of the accrued benet priorto completing ve years of service). The plan imple-ments a suspension of benets on January 1, 2017.As of that date, a participant has three years ofvesting service, and none of the participant's benetsare nonforfeitable under the terms of the plan. (ii)Calculation of nonforfeitable benets . For purposes of applying the guarantee-based limitation,the participant is considered to have a nonforfeitableright to 100% of the accrued benet under the planas of January 1, 2017. (3)Age-based limitation \u2014(i) No sus- pension for participants or beneciarieswho are age 80 and older . No suspension of benets is permitted to apply to a par-ticipant, beneciary, or alternate payeewho\u2014 (A) Has commenced benets as of the effective date of the suspension; and (B) Has attained 80 years of age no later than the end of the month that in-cludes the effective date of the suspen-sion. (ii)Limited suspension for participants and beneciaries between ages 75 and 80 . No more than the applicable percentage ofthe maximum suspendable benet may besuspended for a participant, beneciary,or alternate payee who\u2014(A) Has commenced benets as of the effective date of the suspension; and (B) Has attained 75 years of age no later than the end of the month that in-cludes the effective date of the suspen-sion. (iii) Maximum suspendable benet \u2014 (A)In general . For purposes of this para- graph (d)(3), the maximum suspendablebenet with respect to a participant, ben-eciary, or alternate payee is the portionof the individual's benets that would oth-erwise be suspended pursuant to this sec-tion (that is, the amount that would besuspended without regard to the limitationin this paragraph (d)(3)). (B)Coordination of limitations .A ni n - dividual's maximum suspendable benetis calculated after the application of theguarantee-based limitation under para-graph (d)(2) of this section and thedisability-based limitation under para-graph (d)(4) of this section. (iv) Applicable percentage . For pur- poses of this paragraph (d)(3), the appli- cable percentage is the percentage ob-tained by dividing\u2014 (A) The number of months during the period beginning with the month after themonth in which the suspension of benetsis effective and ending with the monthduring which the participant or bene-ciary attains the age of 80, by (B) 60.(v)Applicability of age-based limita- tion to benets paid to beneciaries .I ft h e age-based limitation in this paragraph(d)(3) applies to a participant on the ef-fective date of the suspension, then theage-based limitation also applies to thebeneciary of the participant, based onthe age of the participant on the effectivedate of the suspension. (vi) Rule for benets that have not commenced at the time of the suspension . If benets have not commenced to either aparticipant or beneciary as of the effec-tive date of the suspension, then in apply-ing this paragraph (d)(3)\u2014 (A) If the participant is alive on the effective date of the suspension, the par-ticipant is treated as having commencedbenets on that date; and (B) If the participant is deceased on effective date of the suspension, the ben-eciary is treated as having commencedbenets on that date.(vii) Rules for alternate payees . The age-based limitation in this paragraph(d)(3) applies to a suspension of benetsin which an alternate payee has an inter-est, whether or not the alternate payee hascommenced benets as of the effective date of the suspension. For purposes ofthis paragraph (d)(3), the applicable per-centage for an alternate payee is calcu-lated by\u2014 (A) Using the participant's age as of the effective date of the suspension, if thealternate payee's right to the suspendedbenets derives from a qualied domesticrelations order within the meaning of sec-tion 414(p)(1)(A) (QDRO) under whichthe alternate payee shares in each benetpayment but the participant retains theright to choose the time and form of pay-ment with respect to the benet to whichthe suspension applies (shared paymentQDRO); or (B) Substituting the alternate payee's age as of the effective date of the suspen-sion for the participant's age, if the alter-nate payee's right to the suspended bene-ts derives from a QDRO under which thealternate payee has a separate right to re-ceive a portion of the participant's retire-ment benet to be paid at a time and in aform different from that chosen by theparticipant (separate interest QDRO). (viii) Examples . The following exam- ples illustrate of this paragraph(d)(3): Example 1 . (i)Facts . The plan sponsor of a plan in critical and declining status is implementing asuspension of benets, effective December 1, 2017,that would reduce all benet payments under theplan by 30%. On that date, a retiree is receiving amonthly benet of $1,500 (which is not a benetbased on disability) and has 28 years of creditedservice under the plan. If none of the limitations insection 432(e)(9)(D)(i), (ii), and (iii) were to apply, a30% suspension would reduce the retiree's monthlybenet by $450, to $1,050. Under the guarantee-based limitation in section 432(e)(9)(D)(i), the retir-ee's monthly benet could not be reduced by morethan $398.90, to $1,101.10 (1.1 x (28 x ($11 /H11001(.75 x $33)))). The retiree is 77 years old on the effectivedate of the suspension, turns 78 on December 15,2017, and turns 80 on December 15, 2019. (ii)Maximum suspendable benet . Because the retiree is not receiving on disabilityunder section 432(e)(9)(D)(iii), is $398.90 (which is equalto the lesser of reduction that would apply pursuantto the 30% suspension ($450) or the amount ofreduction that would be permitted under theguarantee-based limitation ($398.90)). August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 146(iii)Applicable percentage . Because the retiree is between ages 75 and 80 on the effective date of thesuspension, the reduction is not permitted to exceedthe applicable percentage of the retiree's maximumsuspendable benet. The number of months duringthe period beginning with January 2018 (the monthafter the month that includes the effective date of thesuspension) and ending with December 2019 (themonth in which the retiree turns 80) is 24. Theapplicable percentage is equal to 40% (24 monthsdivided by 60). Age-based 40%. Thus, under the age-basedlimitation, the retiree's benet may not be reducedby more than $159.56 ($398.90 x .40 /H11005$159.56). Because the retiree was receiving a monthly benetof $1,500, the suspension of benets may below /H11005$1,340.44). Example 2 . (i) Facts . The facts are the same as Example 1 , except that the retiree is 79 years old on December 1, 2017, and turns 80 on December 15,2017. (ii)Age-based limitation . The suspension is not permitted to apply to the retiree because the retireewill turn 80 by the end of the month (December2017) in which the suspension is effective. Example 3 . (i) Facts . The facts are the same as Example 1 , but on the effective date of the suspen- sion, the retiree is receiving a benet in the form ofa 50% joint and survivor annuity for himself and acontingent beneciary who is age 71. The retiree dies in October 2018. (ii)Application of age-based limitation to con- tingent beneciary . Because the retiree had attained age 78 in the month that included the effective dateof the suspension, the age-based limitation on thesuspension of benets for a 78-year-old individualapplies to the retiree. The age-based limitation alsoapplies to the contingent beneciary, even thoughthe contingent beneciary had not commenced ben-ets under the plan as of the effective date of thesuspension and had not attained age 75 by the end ofthe month containing the effective date of the sus-pension. (iii) Maximum suspendable benet . The contin- gent beneciary's amount of guarantee byPBGC is based on the benet the beneciary wouldhave received from the plan before the suspension($750). The beneciary's accrual rate is $26.7857(calculated by dividing the monthly benet payment($750) by years of credited service (28)) and thebeneciary's amount of guarantee payable by PBGCis $639.50 (28 suspendable benet is$46.55 (which is equal to the lesser of reduction thatwould apply pursuant to the 30% suspension ($225)or the amount of reduction that would be permittedunder the guarantee-based limitation ($46.55, whichis equal to ($750 . The applicable per- centage for the beneciary is based on the retiree'sage of 78 on the effective date of the suspension.Accordingly, the applicable percentage for the ben-eciary Thus, under the age-based limitation, the beneciary's benet may not be re-duced by more than $18.62 ($46.55 x .40 /H11005$18.62). Therefore, as a result of the retiree's age-based lim-itation, the suspension of benets benet below $731.38 ($750 -$18.62/H11005$731.38). Example 4 . (i) Facts . The facts are the same as Example 3 , except that on the effective date of the suspension the retiree is age 71 and the retiree'scontingent beneciary is age 77. (ii)Application of age-based limitation to con- tingent beneciary . Because the retiree had not reached age 75 as of the effective date of the sus-pension, the age-based limitation on the suspensionof benets does not apply to the retiree. The age-based limitation also does not apply to the retiree'scontingent beneciary, even though the contingentbeneciary had attained age 77 as of the effectivedate of the suspension, because the contingent ben-eciary had not yet commenced benets on that date.The beneciary's post-suspension benet may not beless than minimum benet payable pursuant to theguarantee-based limitation, which is $703.45($639.50 x 1.1 /H11005$703.45). Example 5 . (i)Facts . The facts are the same as in Example 4 , except that the retiree died in October 2017, prior to the December 1, 2017 effective date ofthe suspension of benets. The on the retiree's beneciary had commenced benets before the effective date ofthe suspension and had reached age 75 by the end ofthe month that includes the effective date of thesuspension, the age-based limitation applies to thebeneciary based on the beneciary's age on theeffective date of the suspension. (4) Disability-based limitation \u2014(i) General rule [The text of the proposed amendments to \u00a7 1.432(e)(9)-1(d)(4)(i) isthe same as \u00a7 1.432(e)(9)-1T(d)(4)(i)published elsewhere in this issue of theFederal Register .] (ii)Benets based on disability \u2014(A) In general . For purposes of this section, benets based on disability means the en-tire amount paid to a participant pursuantto the participant becoming disabled,without regard to whether a portion of thatamount would have been paid if the par-ticipant had not become disabled. (B)Rule for auxiliary or other tempo- rary disability benets . If a participant begins receiving an auxiliary or other tem-porary disability benet and the sole rea-son the participant ceases receiving thatbenet is commencement of retirementbenets, the benet based on disabilityafter commencement of retirement bene-ts is the lesser of\u2014 (1) The periodic payment the partici- pant was receiving immediately before theparticipant's retirement benets com- menced; or (2) The total periodic payments to the participant under the plan. (C)Examples . The following examples illustrate the disability-based limitation ona suspension of benets under this para-graph (d)(4): Example 1 . (i)Facts . A participant with a vested accrued benet of $1,000 per month, payable at age65, becomes disabled at age 55. The plan applies areduction to the monthly benet for early com-mencement if the participant commences benetsbefore age 65. For a participant who commencesreceiving benets at age 55, the actuarially adjustedearly retirement benet is 60% of the accrued ben-et. However, the plan also provides that if a partic-ipant becomes entitled to an early retirement beneton account of disability, as dened in the plan, thebenet is not reduced. On account of a disability, theparticipant commences an unreduced early retire-ment benet of $1,000 at age 55 (insteadof the $600 monthly benet the participant wouldreceive if the participant were not disabled). Theparticipant continues to receive $1,000 per monthafter reaching age 65. (ii)Conclusion . The participant's disability ben- et payment of $1,000 per month commencing atage 55 is a benet based on disability, even thoughthe participant would have received a portion ofthese benets at retirement regardless of the disabil-ity. Thus, both before and after attaining age 65, theparticipant's entire monthly payment amount($1,000) is a benet based on disability. A suspen-sion of benets is not permitted to apply to anyportion of the participant's benet at any time. Example 2 . (i) Facts . The facts are the same as Example 1 , except that the terms of the plan provide that when a disabled participant reaches age 65, thedisability pension is discontinued by reason of reach-ing age 65, and the retirement benets commence. Inthis case, the amount of the participant's retirementbenets is the same as the amount that the participantwas receiving immediately before commencing re-tirement benets, or $1,000. (ii)Conclusion . Before age 65, disability benet payment of $1,000 per month com-mencing at age 55 is a benet based on disability.After age 65, the periodic payment of $1,000 permonth that the participant was receiving immedi-ately before commencing retirement benets is abenet based on disability. Thus, both before andafter attaining age 65, the participant's entiremonthly payment amount ($1,000) is a benet basedon disability. A suspension of benets is not permit-ted to apply to any portion of the participant's benetat any time. Example 3 .(i) Facts . The facts are the same as Example 2 , except that upon reaching age 65, the participant elects to commence payment of retire-ment benets not in the form of a single life annuitypayable in the amount of $1,000 per month butinstead in the form of an actuarially equivalent jointand survivor annuity payable in the amount of $850per month. (ii)Conclusion . Before age 65, the participant's benet based on disability is $1,000 per month. After Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 147age 65, the participant's benet based on disability is $850 per month. Thus, a suspension of benets is notpermitted to apply to any portion of those benets atany time. Example 4 . (i) Facts . A participant's disability pension is a specied amount unrelated to the par-ticipant's accrued benet. The participant's disabil-ity benet commencing at age 55 is $750 per month.Upon reaching age 65, the participant's disabilitypension is discontinued by reason of reaching age 65and the participant elects to receive an accrued ben-et payable in the amount of $1,000 per month. (ii)Conclusion . Before age 65, the participant's benet based on disability is $750 per month. Afterage 65, the participant's benet based on disabilitycontinues to be $750 per month (even though theparticipant's payment is $1,000 per month), becausethe benet based on disability is the lesser of theperiodic disability pension the participant was re-ceiving immediately before retirement benets com-menced ($750) and the periodic payment to the par-ticipant under the plan ($1,000). Thus, a suspensionof benets is not permitted to reduce the partici-pant's benet based on disability ($750 per month)at any time. Example 5 . (i) Facts . The facts are the same as Example 2 , except that when the participant attains age 65, the participant's monthly benet paymentincreases from $1,000 to $1,300 as a result of theplan providing additional accruals during the periodof disability, as if the participant was not disabled. (ii)Conclusion .A si n Example 2 , before age 65, the participant's benet payment of $1,000 per month commencing at age 55 is a benet based ondisability. After age 65, the participant's benet pay-ment of $1,300 per month is a benet ondisability because the $1,300 is payable based onadditional accruals earned pursuant to the participantbecoming disabled. Thus, both before and after at-taining age 65, the participant's entire monthly pay-ment amount is a benet based on disability. Asuspension of benets is not permitted to apply toany portion of the participant's benet at any time. Example 6 . (i) Facts . The facts are the same as Example 3 of paragraph (d)(2)(v) of this section, except that the Social Security level income option isonly available to a participant who incurs a disabilityas dened in the plan. (ii)Conclusion . Before normal retirement age, the participant's benet payment of $1,600 permonth is a benet based disability. After normalretirement age, the participant's benet based ondisability is $900, which is the lesser of the $1,600periodic payment that the participant was receivingimmediately before the participant's normal retire-ment benet commenced and the participant's $900normal retirement benet. Thus, a suspension ofbenets is not permitted to apply to any portion ofthose benets ($1,600 per month before and $900per month after normal retirement age) at any time. Example 7 . (i)Facts . A plan applies a reduction to the monthly benet for early commencement if aparticipant commences benets before age 65. Theplan also provides that if a participant becomes dis-abled, as dened in the plan, the benet that is paidbefore normal retirement age is not reduced for earlyretirement. Under the plan, when a disabled partici-pant reaches age 65, the disability pension is discon-tinued by reason of reaching age 65 and the retire- ment benets commence. A participant with a vestedaccrued benet of $1,000 per month, payable at age65, becomes disabled at age 55. On account of thedisability, the participant commences benets at age55 in the amount of $1,000 per month (instead of the$600 monthly benet the participant could have re-ceived at that age if the participant were not dis-abled). The participant recovers from the disability atage 60, and the participant's disability benets cease.At age 60, the participant immediately benet of $800. participant's disability ben- et payment of $1,000 per month commencing atage 55 is a benet based on disability, even thoughthe participant would have received a portion ofthese benets at retirement regardless of the disabil-ity. Because the participant ceased receiving disabil-ity benets on account of the participant no longerbeing disabled (and not solely on account of com-mencing retirement benets), the participant's earlyretirement benet of $800 per month that began afterthe benet ended is not a benet based ondisability. (5)Limitation on aggregate size of sus- General . Any suspen- sion of benets (considered, if applicable,in combination with a partition of the planunder section 4233 of ERISA (partition))must be at a level that is reasonably esti-mated to\u2014 (A) Enable the plan to avoid insol- vency; and (B) Not materially exceed the level that is necessary to enable the plan to avoidinsolvency. (ii)Suspension sufcient to avoid in- solvency \u2014(A) General A suspen- sion of benets (considered, if applicable,in combination with a partition of theplan) will satisfy the requirement that it isat a level that is reasonably estimated toenable the plan to avoid insolvency if\u2014 (1) For each plan year throughout an extended period (as described in para-graph (d)(5)(ii)(C) of this section) begin-ning on the rst day of the plan year thatincludes the effective date of the suspen-sion, the plan's solvency ratio is projected on a deterministic basis to be at least 1.0; (2) Based on stochastic projections re- flecting variance in investment return, theprobability that the plan will avoid insol-vency throughout the extended period ismore than 50 percent; and (3) Unless the plan's projected funded percentage (within the meaning of section432(j)(2)) at the end of the extended pe-riod using a deterministic projection ex-ceeds 100 percent, then the projectionshows that at all times during the last veplan years of that period, there is no pro- jected decrease in either the plan's sol-vency ratio or its available resources (asdened in section 418E(b)(3)). (B)Solvency ratio . For purposes of this section, a plan's solvency ratio for a planyear means the ratio of\u2014 (1) The plan's available resources (as dened in section 418E(b)(3)) for the planyear; to (2) The scheduled benet payments under the plan for the plan year. (C)Extended period . For purposes of this section, an extended period means aperiod of at least 30 plan years. However,in the case of a temporary suspension ofbenets that is scheduled to cease as of adate that is more than 25 years after theeffective date, the extended period mustbe lengthened so that it ends no earlierthan ve plan years after the cessation ofthe suspension. (iii) Suspension not materially in ex- cess of level necessary to avoid insolven-cy\u2014(A) General rule . A suspension of benets will satisfy the requirement underparagraph (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section thatthe suspension be at a level that is reason-ably estimated to not materially exceedthe level necessary for the plan to avoidinsolvency only if an alternative, similarbut smaller suspension of benets, underwhich the dollar amount of the suspensionfor each participant and beneciary is re-duced by ve percent would not be suf-cient to enable the plan to satisfy the re-quirement to avoid insolvency underparagraph (d)(5)(i)(A) of this section. (B)Special rule for partitions .I ft h e PBGC issues an order partitioning theplan, then a suspension of benets withrespect to the plan will be deemed tosatisfy the requirement under paragraph(d)(5)(i)(B) of this section that the suspen-sion be at a level that is reasonably esti- mated to not materially exceed the levelnecessary for the plan to avoid insolvency. (iv) Actuarial basis for projections \u2014 (A)In general . This paragraph (d)(5)(iv) sets forth rules for the actuarial projec-tions that are required under this para-graph (d)(5). The projections must reflectthe assumption that the suspension of ben-ets continues indenitely (or, if the sus-pension expires on a specied date by itsown terms, until that date). August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 148(B)Reasonable actuarial assumptions and methods . The actuarial assumptions and methods used for the actuarial projec-tions must be reasonable, in accordancewith the rules of section 431(c)(3). Theactuary's selection of assumptions aboutfuture covered employment and contribu-tion levels (including contribution baseunits and average contribution rate) maybe based on information provided by theplan sponsor, which must act in good faithin providing the information. In addition,to the extent that the actuarial assumptionsused for the deterministic projection differfrom those used to certify whether theplan is in critical and declining status pur-suant to section 432(b)(3)(B)(iv), a justi-cation for that difference must be pro-vided. Similarly, to the extent that theactuarial assumptions used for the sto-chastic projection differ from those usedfor the deterministic projection (other thanthe rate of investment return), a justica-tion for that difference must be provided. (C) Initial value of plan assets and cash flow projections . Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(iv)(D) of this section,the cash flow projections must be basedon\u2014 (1) The fair market value of assets as of end of the most recent calendar quarter; (2) Projected benet payments that are consistent with the projected benet pay-ments under the most recent actuarial val-uation; and (3) Appropriate adjustments to pro- jected benet payments to include benetsfor new hires who are reflected in theprojected contribution amounts. (D)Requirement to reflect signicant events . The projected cash flows relating to contributions, withdrawal liability pay-ments, and benet payments must also beadjusted to reflect signicant events thatoccurred after the most recent actuarialvaluation. Signicant events include\u2014 (1) A plan merger or transfer; (2) The withdrawal or the addition of employers that changed projected cashflows relating to contributions, with-drawal liability payments, or benet pay-ments by more than ve percent; (3) A plan amendment, a change in a collective bargaining agreement, or achange in a rehabilitation plan thatchanged projected cash flows relating tocontributions, withdrawal liability pay-ments, or benet payments by more than ve percent; or (4) Any other event or trend that re- sulted in a material change in the pro-jected cash flows. (v) Simplied determination for smaller plans . In the case of a plan that is not large enough to be required to select aretiree representative under paragraph(b)(4) of this section, the determination ofwhether the benet suspension (or a ben-et suspension in combination with a par-tition of the plan) will satisfy the require-ment that it is at a level that is reasonablyestimated to enable the plan to avoid in-solvency is permitted to be made withoutregard to paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(A)( 2) of this section. (vi) Additional disclosure \u2014(A) Dis- closure of past experience for critical as-sumptions . The application for suspension must include a disclosure of the total con-tributions, total contribution base unitsand average contribution rate, withdrawalliability payments, and the rate of return on plan assets for each of the 10 planyears preceding the plan year in which theapplication is submitted. (B)Sensitivity of results to investment return assumptions . The application must include deterministic projections of theplan's solvency ratio over the extendedperiod using two alternative assumptionsfor the plan's rate of return. These alter-natives are that the plan's future rate ofreturn will be lower than the assumed rateof return used under paragraph(d)(5)(iv)(B) of this section by\u2014 (1) One percentage point; and (2) Two percentage points. (C) Sensitivity of results to industry level assumptions . The application must include deterministic projections of theplan's solvency ratio over the extendedperiod using two alternative assumptionsfor the future contribution base units.These alternatives are that the future con-tribution base units\u2014 (1) Continue under the same trend as the plan experienced over the past 10years; and (2) Continue under the trend identied in paragraph (d)(5)(vi)(C)( 1) of this sec- tion reduced by one percentage point. (D)Projection of funded percentage . The application must include an illustra-tion, prepared on a deterministic basis, ofthe projected value of plan assets, the ac- crued liability of the plan (calculated us-ing the unit credit funding method), andthe funded percentage for each year in theextended period. (6)Equitable distribution \u2014(i) In gen- eral. Any suspension of benets must be equitably distributed across the participantand beneciary population, taking into ac-count factors, with respect to participantsand beneciaries and their benets, thatmay include one or more of the factorsdescribed in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of thissection. If a suspension of benets appliesdifferently to different categories orgroups of participants and beneciaries,then the suspension of benets is equita-bly distributed across the participant andbeneciary population only if under thesuspension\u2014 (A) Within each such category or group, the individuals are treated consis-tently; (B) Any difference in treatment among the different categories or groups is based on relevant factors reasonably selected bythe plan sponsor, such as the factors de-scribed in paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of this sec-tion; and (C) Any such difference in treatment is based on a reasonable application of therelevant factors. (ii)Factors that may be considered \u2014 (A)In general . In accordance with para- graph (d)(6)(i)(B) of this section, if thereis any difference in the application of thesuspension of benets between one clas-sication of participants and beneciariesand another classication of participantsand beneciaries, that difference must bebased reasonably on the statutory factors(described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) ofthis section) and any other factors reason-ably selected by the plan sponsor. Forexample, it would be reasonable for a plansponsor to conclude that the statutory fac-tor described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)( 3) of this section (amount of benet) is afactor that should be taken into account asjustifying a lesser benet reduction forparticipants or beneciaries whose bene-ts are closer to the level of the PBGCguarantee than for others. In addition, itwould be reasonable for a plan sponsor toconclude that the presumed nancial vul-nerability of certain participants or bene-ciaries who are reasonably deemed to be Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 149in greater need of protection than other participants or beneciaries is a factor thatshould be taken into account as justifyinga lesser benet reduction (as a percentageor otherwise) for those participants orbeneciaries than for others. (B)Statutory factors . Factors that may be selected as a basis for differences in theapplication of a suspension of benets in-clude, when reasonable under the circum-stances, the following statutory factors: (1) The age and life expectancy of the participant and/or beneciary; (2) The length of time that benets have been in pay status; (3) The amount of benets; (4) The type of benet, such as survi- vor benet, normal retirement benet, orearly retirement benet; (5) The extent to which a participant or beneciary is receiving a subsidized ben-et; (6) The extent to which a participant or beneciary has received post-retirementbenet increases; (7) The history of benet increases and reductions for participants and benecia-ries; (8) The number of years to retirement for active employees; (9) Any differences between active and retiree benets; (10) The extent to which active partic- ipants are reasonably likely to withdrawsupport for the plan, accelerating em-ployer withdrawals from the plan and in-creasing the risk of additional benet re-ductions for participants in and out of paystatus; and (11) The extent to which a participant's or beneciary's benets are attributable toservice with an employer that failed to payits full withdrawal liability. (iii)Reasonable application of factors . A suspension of benets will not satisfythe requirement to be equitably distributedif it is based on an unreasonable applica-tion of the factors referred to in paragraph(d)(6)(ii) of this section. For example, itwould constitute an unreasonable applica-tion of the factor described in paragraph(d)(6)(ii)(B)( 3) of this section (amount of benet) if that factor were used to justifya larger suspension for participants withsmaller benets. (iv)Examples . The following examples illustrate the rules on equitable distribu-tion of a suspension of benets in this paragraph (d)(6). As a simplifying as-sumption for purposes of these examples,it is assumed that the facts of each exam-ple describe all of the factors that areincluded in the application discussed inthe example (provided, however, that, inthe case of a plan described in section432(e)(9)(D)(vii), the examples are not in-tended to illustrate the application of section 432(e)(9)(D)(vii) or its effect on the analysisor conclusions in the examples). Through-out these examples, the guarantee-based,age-based, and disability-based limitationsof section 432(e)(9)(D)(i), (ii), and (iii) arereferred to as the individual limitations onbenet suspensions. Example 1 . (i) Facts . A suspension of benets provides that, subject to the individual limitations onbenet suspensions, benets for all participants andbeneciaries are reduced by the same percentage,and explains the rationale for this reduction. (ii)Conclusion . The suspension of benets is equitably distributed across the participant and ben-eciary populations. Example 2 . (i) Facts . A suspension of benets provides that, subject to the age-based and disability-based limitations of section 432(e)(9)(D)(ii) and (iii),the portion of each participant's and beneciary'sbenet that exceeds the guarantee-based limitationof section 432(e)(9)(D)(i) is reduced by the samepercentage, and explains the rationale for this reduc-tion. (ii)Conclusion . The suspension of benets is equitably distributed across the participant and ben-eciary populations. The result would be the same if,instead, the suspension of benets applies only to benets that exceed a multiple (in excess of 100%)of the guarantee-based limitation. Example 3 . (i) Facts . A plan was previously amended to provide an ad hoc 15% increase to thebenets of all participants and beneciaries (includ-ing participants who, at the time, were no longerearning service under the plan, which therefore in-cluded retirees and deferred vested participants). Theplan sponsor applies for a suspension of benets.Under the suspension of benets, subject to the in-dividual limitations on benet suspensions, benetsfor all participants and beneciaries who were nolonger earning service under the plan at the time ofthe ad hoc amendment are reduced by eliminatingthe amendment for those individuals. The suspensionapplication explains why the benet reduction isbased on the statutory factors in paragraph(d)(6)(ii)(B)( 6) of this section (the extent to which a participant or beneciary has received post-retirement benet increases), including applicationof the reduction to those who, at the time of theprevious benet increase, were either retired partic-ipants or deferred vested participants, and in para-graph (d)(6)(ii)(B)( 7) of this section (the history of benet increases and reductions), and why it is rea-sonable to apply the factors in this manner. (ii)Conclusion . The suspension of benets is equitably distributed across the participant and ben-eciary populations. This is because the difference in treatment among the different groups of participantsis based on whether a participant has received post-retirement benet increases (in this case, whether aparticipant was earning service under the plan at thetime of the benet increase amendment), which un-der these facts is a relevant factor that may bereasonably selected by the plan sponsor, and thedifference in treatment between the groups of par-ticipants (eliminating the amendment only for bene-ts with respect to participants who were no longerearning service at the time of the amendment) isbased on a reasonable application of that factor. Example 4 . (i)Facts . A plan contains a provision that provides a \"thirteenth check\" in plan years forwhich the investment return is greater than 7%(which was the assumed rate of return under theplan's actuarial valuation). The plan sponsor appliesfor a suspension of benets. Under the suspension ofbenets, subject to the individual limitations on ben-et suspensions, benets for all participants and ben-eciaries are reduced by eliminating the \"thirteenthcheck\" for all those individuals. The suspension ap-plication explains why the benet reduction is basedon the statutory factors in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)( 6) of this section (the extent to which a participant orbeneciary has received post-retirement benet in-creases) and in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)( 7) of this section (the history of benet increases and reduc-tions), and why it is reasonable to apply the factorsin this manner. (ii)Conclusion . The suspension of benets is equitably distributed across the participant and ben- eciary populations. Example 5 . (i) Facts . A plan was previously amended to reduce future accruals from $60 per yearof service to $50 per year of service. The plansponsor applies for a suspension of benets. Underthe suspension of benets, subject to the individuallimitations on benet suspensions, the accrued ben-ets for all participants and beneciaries are reducedto $50 per year of service (and applies the plan'sgenerally applicable adjustments for early retirementand form of benet). The suspension applicationexplains why the benet reduction is based on thestatutory factor in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)( 7) of this section (the history of benet increases and reduc-tions), and why it is reasonable to apply the factorsin this manner. (ii)Conclusion . The suspension of benets is equitably distributed across the participant and ben-eciary populations. This is because the difference intreatment among the different groups of participantsis based on the history of benet reductions and adiscrepancy between active and retiree benets,which under these facts are relevant factors that maybe reasonably selected by the plan sponsor, and thedifference in treatment between the groups of par-ticipants (reducing the $60 benet multiplier to $50per year of service for those participants who hadaccrued any benets under the $60 multiplier) isbased on a reasonable application of those factors. Example 6 . (i)Facts . The facts are the same as in Example 5 , except that no plan amendments have previously reduced future accruals or other benetsfor active participants. Under the suspension of ben-ets, subject to the individual limitations on benetsuspensions, benets for deferred vested partici- August 3, 2015 Bulletin No. 2015-31 150pants, retirees and beneciaries who have com- menced benets are reduced, but no reduction ap-plies to active participants. The suspension ofbenets is not accompanied by any reductions infuture accruals or other benets for active partici-pants. (ii)Conclusion . The suspension of benets is not equitably distributed across the participant and ben-eciary populations. This is because, under thesefacts, no relevant factor (such as a previous reductionin benets applicable only to active participants) hasbeen reasonably selected by the plan sponsor tojustify the proposed difference in treatment amongthe categories. Example 7 . (i)Facts . The facts are the same as in Example 6 , except that the suspension of benets provides for a reduction that applies to both activeand inactive participants. However, the reductionthat applies to active participants is smaller than thereduction that applies to inactive participants be-cause the plan sponsor concludes, as explained andsupported in the application for suspension, that ac-tive participants are reasonably likely to withdrawsupport for the plan if any larger reduction is applied. (ii)Conclusion . The suspension of benets is equitably distributed across the participant and ben-eciary populations. This is because the difference intreatment among the different groups of participantsis based on the extent to which active participants arereasonably likely to withdraw support for the plan,which under these facts is a relevant factor that mayreasonably be selected by the plan sponsor, and thedifference in treatment between the two groups of participants (applying a greater suspension to inac-tive than to active participants) is based on a reason-able application of that factor. Example 8 . (i) Facts . A suspension of benets provides that, subject to the individual limitations onbenet suspensions, the benets for participants andbeneciaries attributable to service with an employerthat failed to pay its full withdrawal liability arereduced by 50%. The plan sponsor applies for asuspension of benets. As explained in the suspen-sion application, the present value of the benetreduction with respect to the former employees ofone such employer is signicantly greater than theunpaid withdrawal liability for that employer. Ben-ets for participants and beneciaries attributable toservice with all other employers are reduced by 10%. (ii)Conclusion . The suspension of benets is not equitably distributed across the participant and ben-eciary populations. This is because although thedifference in treatment among the different groups ofparticipants is based on a relevant factor that mayreasonably be selected by the plan sponsor, the dif-ference in treatment between the groups of partici-pants is not based on a reasonable application of thatfactor. Example 9 . (i) Facts . A suspension of benets provides that, subject to the individual limitations onbenet suspensions, the benets for all participantsand beneciaries are reduced by the same percent-age, except that the benets for employees and for-mer employees of a particular employer that is ac-tively represented on the plan's Board of Trusteesare reduced by a specied lesser percentage. (ii)Conclusion . The suspension of benets is not equitably distributed across the participant and ben-eciary populations. This is because, under these facts, no relevant factor has been reasonably selectedby the plan sponsor to justify the difference in treat-ment among the groups of employees. Example 10 . (i)Facts . The facts are the same as inExample 9 , except that the particular employer whose employees and former employees are subjectto the lesser benet reduction is the union that alsoparticipates in the plan. (ii)Conclusion . The suspension of benets is not equitably distributed across the participant and ben-eciary populations. This is because, under thesefacts, no relevant factor has been reasonably selectedby the plan sponsor to justify the difference in treat-ment among the groups of employees. Example 11 . (i) Facts . A suspension of benets provides that, subject to the individual limitations onbenet suspensions, the monthly benet of all par-ticipants and beneciaries is reduced to 110% of themonthly benet that is guaranteed by the PBGCunder section 4022A of ERISA. The plan sponsorapplies for a suspension of benets. As explained inthe suspension application, this is because the plansponsor is applying to the PBGC for a partition ofthe plan, which requires the plan sponsor to have implemented the maximum benet suspensions un-der section 432(e)(9). (ii)Conclusion . The suspension of benets is equitably distributed across the participant and ben-eciary populations. Example 12 . (i)Facts . The facts are the same as inExample 1 , except that the suspension of benets provides that the protection for benets based ondisability also includes payments to a beneciary ofa participant who had been receiving benets basedon disability at the time of death. (ii)Conclusion . The suspension of benets is equitably distributed across the participant and ben-eciary populations because this suspension designis a reasonable application of the statutory factor inparagraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)( 4) of this section (type of benet). (7)Effective date of suspension made in combination with partition. [The text of the proposed amendments to \u00a7 1.432(e)(9)-1(d)(7) is the same as \u00a7 1.432(e)(9)-1T(d)(7) published elsewhere issue . para- graph (e) sets forth rules for the applica-tion of section 432(e)(9)(E). A plansatises the criteria in section432(e)(9)(E) only if, during the period thatany suspension of benets remains in ef-fect, the plan sponsor does not implementany benet improvement except as pro-vided in this paragraph (e). Paragraph(e)(2) of this section describes limitationson a benet improvement for participantsand beneciaries who are not yet in paystatus. Paragraph (e)(3) of this section de-scribes limitations on a benet improve-ment for participants and beneciarieswho are in pay status. Paragraph (e)(4) of this section provides that the limitations inthis paragraph (e) generally apply in ad-dition to other limitations on benet in-creases that apply to a plan. Paragraph(e)(5) benet im-provement. (2)Limitations on pay status \u2014(i) Eq- uitable distribution for those in pay statusand solvency projection . During the pe- riod that any suspension of benets undera plan remains in effect, the plan sponsormay not increase the liabilities of the planby reason of any benet improvement forany participant or beneciary who was notin pay status for any plan year before theplan year for which the benet improve-ment takes effect, unless\u2014 (A) The present value of the total lia- bilities for a benet improvement for par-ticipants and beneciaries whose benetcommencement dates were before the rstday of the plan year for which the benetimprovement takes effect is not less than the present value of the total liabilities fora benet improvement for participants andbeneciaries who were not in pay statusby that date; (B) The plan sponsor equitably distrib- utes the benet improvement among theparticipants and beneciaries whose ben-et commencement dates were before therst day of the plan year in which thebenet improvement is proposed to takeeffect; and (C) The plan actuary certies that after taking into account the benet improve-ment, the plan is projected to avoid insol-vency indenitely. (ii)Rules of application \u2014(A) Present value determination . For purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(i)(A) of this section, thepresent value of the total liabilities for abenet improvement is the present valueas of the rst day of the plan year in whichthe benet improvement is proposed totake effect, using actuarial assumptions inaccordance with section 431. (B)Factors relevant to equitable dis- tribution . The evaluation of whether a benet improvement is equitably distrib-uted for purposes of paragraph(e)(2)(i)(B) of this section must take intoaccount the relevant factors described inparagraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section andthe extent to which the benets of the Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, be made using the standardsdescribed in paragraphs (d)(5)(ii), (iv),and (v) of this section, substituting theplan year that includes the effective dateof the benet improvement for the planyear that includes the effective date of thesuspension. (iii) Special rule for certain benet in- creases . The limitations of this paragraph (e) do not apply to a resumption of sus-pended benets or plan amendment that in-creases liabilities with respect to participantsand beneciaries not in pay status by therst day of the plan year in which the benetimprovement took effect that\u2014 (A) The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the PBGC and the Secre-tary of Labor, determines to be reasonableand which provides for only de minimisincreases in the liabilities of the plan; or (B) Is required as a condition of qual- ication under section 401 or to complywith other applicable law, as determinedby the Secretary of the Treasury. (3)Limitation on resumption of sus- pended benets only for those in pay sta-tus. The plan sponsor may increase liabil- ities of the plan by eliminating some or allof the suspension that applies solely toparticipants and beneciaries in pay statusat the time of the resumption, providedthat the plan sponsor equitably distributesthe value of those resumed benets amongparticipants and beneciaries in pay sta-tus, taking into account the relevant fac-tors described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)of this section. A resumption of benetsthat is described in this paragraph (e)(3) isnot subject to the limitations on a benetimprovement under section 432(f) (relat-ing to restrictions on benet increases forplans in critical status). (4)Additional limitations . Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this sec-tion, the limitations on a benet improve-ment under this paragraph (e) are in addi-tion to the limitations in section 432(f)and any other applicable limitations onincreases in benets imposed on a plan. (5) Denition of benet improve- ment \u2014(i) In general . For purposes of this paragraph (e), the term benet improve-ment means, with respect to a plan, aresumption of suspended benets, an in- crease in benets, an increase in the rate atwhich benets accrue, or an increase inthe rate at which benets become nonfor-feitable under the plan. (ii)Effect of expiration of suspension . In the case of a suspension of benets thatexpires as of a date that is specied in theplan amendment implementing the sus-pension, the resumption of benets solelyfrom the expiration of that period is nottreated as a benet improvement.

(Filed by the Ofce of the Federal Register on June 17, 2015, 11:15 am, and published in the issue of the FederalRegister for June 19, 2015, 80 F.R. 35262) Bulletin No. 2015-31 August 3, 2015 153Denition of Terms Revenue rulings and revenue procedures (hereinafter referred to as \"rulings\") thathave an effect on previous rulings use thefollowing dened terms to describe theeffect: Amplied describes a situation where no change is being made in a prior pub-lished position, but the prior position isbeing extended to apply to a variation ofthe fact situation set forth therein. Thus, ifan earlier ruling held that a principle ap-plied to A, and the new ruling holds thatthe same principle also applies to B, theearlier ruling is amplied. (Compare withmodied, below). Claried is used in those instances where the language in a prior ruling isbeing made clear because the languagehas caused, or may cause, some confu-sion. It is not used where a position in aprior ruling is being changed. Distinguished describes a situation where a ruling mentions a previously pub-lished ruling and points out an essentialdifference between them. Modied is used where the substance of a previously published position is beingchanged. Thus, if a prior ruling held that aprinciple applied to A but not to B, and thenew ruling holds that it applies to both Aand B, the prior ruling is modied because it corrects a published position. (Comparewith amplied and claried , above). Obsoleted describes a previously pub- lished ruling that is not considered deter-minative with respect to future transac-tions. This term is most commonly used ina ruling that lists previously published rul-ings that are obsoleted because of changesin laws or regulations. A ruling may alsobe obsoleted because the substance hasbeen included in regulations subsequentlyadopted. Revoked describes situations where the position in the previously published rulingis not correct and the correct position isbeing stated in a new ruling. Superseded describes a situation where the new ruling does nothing more thanrestate the substance and situation of apreviously published ruling (or rulings).Thus, the term is used to republish underthe 1986 Code and regulations the sameposition published under the 1939 Codeand regulations. The term is also usedwhen it is desired to republish in a singleruling a series of situations, names, etc.,that were previously published over a pe-riod of time in separate rulings. If the newruling does more than restate the sub-stance of a prior ruling, a combination of terms is used. For example, modied andsuperseded describes a situation where the substance of a previously published rulingis being changed in part and is continuedwithout change in part and it is desired torestate the valid portion of the previouslypublished ruling in a new ruling that isself contained. In this case, the previouslypublished ruling is rst modied and then,as modied, is superseded. Supplemented is used in situations in which a list, such as a list of the names ofcountries, is published in a ruling and thatlist is expanded by adding further namesin subsequent rulings. After the originalruling has been supplemented severaltimes, a new ruling may be published thatincludes the list in the original ruling andthe additions, and supersedes all prior rul-ings in the series. Suspended is used in rare situations to show that the previous published rulingswill not be applied pending some futureaction such as the issuance of new oramended regulations, the outcome ofcases in litigation, or the outcome of aService study.
