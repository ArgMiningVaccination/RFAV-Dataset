Xi ordered a full investigation as outrage swelled among Chinese parents that hundreds of thousands of children had been given faulty vaccines. \"Changchun Changsheng Biotechnology's illegal production of vaccines is vile in nature and shocking,\" Xi said. Inspectors will be sent into all Chinese vaccine companies as the scandal over faked records for a rabies vaccine prompted Chinese Premier Li Keqiang to declare a moral boundary had been crossed. Chinese social media erupted in anger at the weekend over the revelation that the company, caught faking production and inspection records for a rabies vaccine in July, had the previous October been caught selling ineffective whooping cough and tetanus vaccines for babies. Changchun Changsheng is the second-largest rabies vaccine maker in China, but a week ago was ordered by the Food and Drug Administration to stop production, and for all rabies vaccines to be recalled, after problems were uncovered in a surprise raid on July 5. On Friday, the company was fined 2.58 million Chinese yuan by the provincial regulator in Jilin for producing over 256,000 doses of substandard DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) vaccine last year. The DPT vaccine is compulsory for babies, but the batches were found to be too weak to provide immunity. This prompted criticism that regulators had been too slow to act. A hashtag of the company's name attracted more than 49 million views on Chinese social media before censors began removing angry content on Sunday afternoon, wrote Manya Koetse of monitoring company Whats on Weibo. On Sunday, Li instructed the State Council to investigate \"the entire process chain of all vaccine production and sales, and ascertain the truth as soon as possible\". Those found responsible would be \"severely punished\", he said. The vaccine scandal was reported prominently in the official People's Daily and city newspapers on Monday. An editorial in the China Daily called for greater transparency to ease public panic over the vaccine scandal. \"A public apology is far from enough to iron out people's distrust of the entire industry ... which has been contaminated by scandals,\" the editorial said. Li's response, and the official media's move to prominently cover the issue, appeared designed to take the heat out of public anger. When Chinese president Xi Jinping came to power in 2013 he identified food safety as a priority for government, and has previously said food safety impacts public confidence in government. The Chinese public's sensitivity to food and drug manufacturing scandals was heightened after tens of thousands of babies were hospitalised, and some died, consuming contaminated infant formula a decade ago. The milk powder scandal caused deep mistrust in China's food supply. China's vaccine industry has also been plagued by corruption, and in 2016 it was discovered 2 million ineffective vaccines that were illegally distributed had not been stored correctly. Shanghai's The Paper reported on Monday that salesmen working for Changchun Changsheng had been involved in more than 10 cases resulting in convictions for bribery, after offering kickbacks to hospital staff, since 2010. China has the second highest number of rabies cases in the world, with an average 2000 deaths each year, and administers the biggest number of rabies vaccines annually, according to the World Health Organisation. China was approved by the World Health Organisation to manufacture vaccines for export in 2011. Changchun Changsheng exports to countries including India and Cambodia. The company apologised in a statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange. [Kirsty Needham](/by/kirsty-needham-hvews)is a former China Correspondent for The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.Connect via "}
