Depending on the medical complexities of the eating disorder, we have clients work with a team including a psychologist, dietitian, and medical provider. Using cognitive behavioral therapy, we normalize clients' food intake by creating structure and reintroducing forbidden foods back into the diet. We also help clients abstain from concerning behaviors such as purging, laxative use, and compulsive exercising. Clients are taught tools and strategies to manage distressing thoughts, feelings, and emotions related to fear of weight gain and body image dissatisfaction in efforts to help clients live a more meaningful life connected to their personal values. Our dietitians support clients to ensure that they are getting proper nutrition and if appropriate, begin to follow internal cues of hunger and fullness. They provide education on nutrition science and help clients get in tune with their own bodies versus following arbitrary dieting information. For adolescent clients suffering from anorexia, we often draw from Family Based Treatment. In this treatment approach, providers work with parents or guardians to train them in refeeding their child at home and managing eating disorder symptoms. - What is your approach to weight management? - In addressing weight management with clients, we focus less on weight loss and the number on the scale. Instead, we look at behavioral patterns, habits, and choices that may be impacting weight. We also help clients with lifestyle issues that may further be affecting weight such as stress, anxiety, lack of sleep, and managing distressing relationships. We examine the client's relationship with food and the ways in which food is used to cope emotionally. If food is being used to manage distressing thoughts, feelings or emotions, we help clients learn to manage this in alternative ways such that food is eaten in response to hunger and fullness versus emotions. Physical activity is also targeted to help clients find enjoyable forms of movement. - What is the treatment for OCD and anxiety disorders? - We use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Acceptance & Commitment Therapy, Exposure Therapy, and Exposure Response Prevention. These approaches help our clients manage irrational, intrusive, obsessive or maladaptive thought patterns. Behaviorally, clients are assisted in confronting that which they may be avoiding in order to improve quality of life and live a meaningful life more consistent with values. - Do you have LGBTQIA+ friendly and culturally sensitive therapists? - Yes, we do have clinicians on staff who provide LGBTQIA+ affirmative therapy. They are specialized in working with individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, queer, questioning, intersex, or asexual. We also have two clinicians on staff who provide gender affirming treatment evaluations. We also have several clinicians on staff who provide a supportive environment for ethnic minorities. They use multicultural counseling and culturally-tailored treatments. - Do you offer telehealth? - Yes! We offer convenient teletherapy for our clients so they can meet our clinicians from the comfort of their home. Our telehealth platform can be used on a phone, computer, or tablet. The platform is HIPAA compliant and fully secure for your protection and confidentiality. - What conditions do your registered dietitians treat? - Our psychologists specialize in the treatment of eating disorders, weight management, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), prenatal and postnatal nutrition, sports nutrition, digestive disorders including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and general health concerns (high cholesterol, type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and high blood pressure). - What approaches do your registered dietitians use? - Our dietitians do not follow strict dietary protocols unless absolutely necessary. Our dietitians believe in using non-dieting approaches to help their clients such that clients feel satisfied with the food they are choosing to eat. Our dietitians use intuitive eating and mindfulness based approaches to help clients get back in touch with hunger and fullness cues and develop a healthier relationship with food. Our dietitians will also help with meal planning, creating more structure, and providing education about nutrition science. "}
