On June 4th, I'll join nearly 3,000 cyclists & volunteers for the [AIDS/LifeCycle](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aidslifecycle?trk=public_post-text) (ALC), an annual event benefitting two nonprofits doing incredible work for communities in need. ALC is a 7-day, 545-mile bike ride from SF to LA. Several friends have done this event in past years, and I've gladly sponsored them, but I always wondered, \"Wow, what kind of person signs UP for such a thing???\" Then last September, when a dear friend invited me to ride with him, I learned that *I* am that kind of person. I'm also within striking distance of the fundraising goal I set for myself. It seemed a pipe dream early on, but with the generosity of a kind-hearted network, I hope to close the gap to $15k: [https://lnkd.in/gs5wuHQF](https://lnkd.in/gs5wuHQF?trk=public_post-text) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 What has it meant to prep for this ride? \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 I procured a road bike in October, fell twice learning to clip in to my pedals, and eventually mastered trial-by-fire gear shifters. By April, I marveled at my progress, routinely riding 5-7 hours at a time, over 75-105 miles, scaling 4k+ feet elevation gain. Wait, WHAT?!? Then reality hit. April's highs met May's lows; an ache in my left knee worsened, sidelining me for 3(!) weeks. MRI scans confirmed a nasty case of IT band syndrome. Ouch. ALC 2023 kicks off this Sunday. I haven't fully recovered, but I've thrown the kitchen sink at my challenge: cross-training, chiro, PT, acupuncture, massage, kinesio taping, orthotics, megadose NSAIDs, stretching, rolling, ice, heat, salves, unguents, tinctures.... Then last week, for the first time since April 29, I resumed pedaling \u2014 initially on stationary bikes, then outdoors for a few hours. The knee is holding up! At most, a hint of pain. I've got this. So, mindset shift: I may not ride all 545 miles next week, but I'll cover as many as I can with minimal pain, all 7 days. But this isn't about me. It's about the incredible work that the good folks at [San Francisco AIDS Foundation](https://www.linkedin.com/company/san-francisco-aids-foundation?trk=public_post-text) & [Los Angeles LGBT Center](https://www.linkedin.com/company/l-a--gay-&-lesbian-center?trk=public_post-text) do year-round. Huge gratitude to them, and to everyone joining me in supporting them! Follow for updates from the road next week....
