They have provided such profound support to our family in so many ways. I started going to PWC when I was pregnant, in an effort to turn my breech baby. After two adjustments, not only was our little guy flipped in the head-down position, my aching back was feeling great! I was hooked. Since then, I have been going in for regular adjustments for myself and our baby boy. The Docs are amazing with infants and children. Our baby was born with a large bruise (think lemon-sized bump) on his head. After a series of adjustments at PWC, the bruise simply disappeared, and we had a much happier baby. They were able to improve drainage in his skull with gentle manipulation. Amazing. That's just the beginning. Since I've been going to Dr. T and Dr. D, my acid reflux and sensitive tummy issues are practically non-existent. We are eating as healthy as ever, we have switched off of medications and on to natural remedies that work, and we are just plain happier! We have learned so much about day-to-day wellness through our visits to PWC. I literally trust the amazing staff at PWC with my life and the life of my family members. They are so genuinely caring, and it is very obvious to me that our health is their priority. I feel like I hit the jackpot by discovering this amazing resource right in my own neighborhood. - 8/9/2020 Easily one of the best chiropractic practices in the world. This places changes and transforms and saves lives from pregnancy and birth throughout childhood and beyond! The whole team is loving and on purpose and I'm so grateful to have to have been so powerfully influenced by them! - 2/15/2017 As for their services it's a 5 stars, they did what my wife went there for. As others have stated however they do not provide any medical coding or billing info. Your insurance companies WILL NOT cover any of their work. Don't let them telll you otherwise as they did with us. So if you enjoy paying out of pocket for something you are already paying for with your health plan by all means continue to line their pockets. Business owner information Anthony E. 5/30/2017 Hi JP - We have been out of the insurance racket for 3.5 years now, and from Day 1 I personally trained every member of my front office team to be completely clear from the initial phone call on, that we do NOT accept insurance assignment, do not provide codes that fit that model, and do not work with those companies in any manner whatsoever. It is implicitly clear each and every time. We still work on this and discuss this weekly, so I know without any doubt they did everything they could to communicate this to you clearly and concisely. I apologize if that did not come through and across fully in that manner. People are so used to insurance companies having their hands in all things health care, it can actually be more confusing dealing with things outside of their grips. If we truly were in the business of \"lining our pockets\" then we'd do the opposite - accept every insurance possible and bill every service possible on every visit - adding in extra services such as rehab exercises you can learn on your own via YouTube, pillows and orthotics you can buy on Amazon for 10% of the cost insurance pays providers for the same products, and so on. We got out of that insurance racket so we could do just what we did for your wife, provide 5-Star Service and have no one and nothing in the way of us striving for 5-Star Results with each and every patient! If your family needs chiropractic care at some point in the future again, we hope you still consider PWC as the place to get that care. However if you'd like to go somewhere within your health insurance plan, please reach out to us and we'll give you the names of docs in the area who still work with those companies and provide good care! Be well. - Dr. Tony Ebel - 3/29/2012First to Review These guys rock! Our family has been seeing Dr tony and Dr Derrick for well over a year now and have had nothing but positive results with their practice. Through there kind and caring attitudes ... your well being is everyone's passion on the Premier Wellness Team. Their approach is dialed in and takes into account some core areas of how to promote balance in your body and mental health. They spend time with you to help you understand their approach. Day to day they really try and educate you while you visit and check in with you to see how your doing. It is very nice that they have a wide range of offerings through their practice. From Physical Therapy to Massage Therapy and more.... they really help make your care easy. We work together with Laurel as well with personal training. She has done a great job and is very good with work with you and pushing you. The training area is very nice and offers a private environment to work together with their PT staff. On my entire families behalf we have had nothing but positive results with working with these guys. It is not often you meet people that truly care about what they do for everyone around them... you will be in very good hands with everyone at Premier Wellness from the day you walk in the door. - 11/3/2019 We started going to PWC for our daughter who had multiple ear infections by 6 months old. After seeing and feeling how much the staff and doctors cared for her, both my husband and I have started seeing them as well. You will not find a more family friendly, caring place to take your entire family! - 9/7/2016 From the moment I called to make my appointment, all the way up until I left my appointment, everything was fantastic! Extremely nice people everywhere, and not the fake nice kind :-) Very genuine and explained things in a way that anyone could understand. I look forward to my future appointments as well as those for our baby, once he/she is born! - 3/3/2015 We love PWC! Have been going for 5 years! The doctors and staff couldn't be more caring!! We attend weekly visits to maintain good health!! I have three small boys including an infant and would not trust anyone else. Thank you Dr Tony, Dr. Ron, and Dr Jen for keeping my family healthy!!! - 2/24/2015 Beware of Tony and his office staff they will lie and tell you that your insurance will cover treatments without ever actually asking your insurance,, what they like to do is promise that it's covered run up a bill and leave you to fight it out with their collections people. Maybe they just don't know what they are doing in that department or they are shady either way bad business practices on their behalf got me in some trouble. Thanks Dr Tony. Never again. Business owner information Anthony E. 6/10/2015 Hi Denny, We are sorry that you felt this way and hope you have found a chiropractor that does accept your insurance. Insurance denying chiropractic claims and creating unhappy practice members is exactly why we have not accepted insurance since January 2014. We make this very clear to our patients on the first day. A large bill after denied claims that is 100% out of our control is not why we want practice members leaving and why we have changed our billing policies to affordable cash plans in hopes to never have this happen again. Thank for your feedback and we wish you the best. - 7/17/2015Updated review Dr. Tony: I appreciate your apology. Your information regarding any interaction your staff had with me is still incorrect. Which is understandable because as I've stated before, YOU were not there. I was the one present at all these interactions! I remember making the comment you are referring to. It was not about a previous chiropractic experience. It was a joke in an exchange I was having with Dr. Ron. Not only did you get setting wrong, you also quoted the joke incorrectly. My experience at your office was not ideal. My only hope going forward is that you and your staff treat the patients who have placed their trust (and money) in you with honesty, respect, attention and time. Maybe if you had given me those courtesies, things would have turned out differently.6/21/2015Previous review After 6 months of calls, writing letters and sending emails, I finally heard from Dr. Tony via a very long email. The highlight was this: \"The single most important thing you need to be aware of is that you signed a very clear written financial agreement that your care here at PWC was 'No Guarantee of Results' whatsoever.\" So there you go, Yelpers. The doctors tell you they are 110% sure they can get you out of pain but the papers they ask you to sign say otherwise. Find a chiropractor who is confident in their practice and techniques and save yourself $1200 and the emotional distress that PWC has caused me.4/7/2015Previous review I went to Premier Wellness Chiropractic with complaints of daily headaches and neck, shoulder and lower back pain. I paid $1200 upfront (my first mistake) for 24 appointments and was promised that my pain was 110% fixable. I never did get the promised results and I voiced my concern about this to Dr. Ron and Dr. Jen at every appointment. They assured me that my pain was fixable and to be patient. One day I was in tears in the waiting room and stopped Dr. Tony to tell him how much pain I was in. He said, \"I see that\" and kept on walking! Before my last appointment I got an email from Dr. Tony stating that there was nothing wrong with my back (I've seen my x-rays. I guess Dr. Tony thinks uneven hips and a crooked lower spine are normal!?) and his advice was to exercise, get a massage and counseling. How insulting! At my last appointment I expressed my disappointment in the way I was treated by Dr. Tony and my disgust at paying such an outrageous price for no help at all and asked for a full refund. I was told someone would get in touch with me about that. That was a voicemail, several letters and 3 months ago. I've heard nothing from them! So, PATIENT BEWARE! Save $1200 and the aggravation and find yourself an honest and competent chiropractic practice. - 3/5/2015 We love Dr Tony, Dr Ron and Dr Jen. We've been patients there for two years and have always had the best chiropractic care. Premier isn't just a chiropractic office, it's a wellness center. The doctors always have our best interest at hand when treating us and are wonderful with kids! I highly recommend Dr Tony and his staff.
