Catalogs published by the University from the very earliest years declare the commitment of this institution to the highest and best. The mission statement and current values of the University are included below: Mission Statement The University of Jamestown is a student-centered university dedicated to the development of wholeness in all members of our community. We adhere to a curriculum of academic excellence which blends the liberal arts with sound professional preparation. Our commitment to the Christian faith encourages an atmosphere of self-discipline, responsibility, and concern for the continuing growth of the individual. History and Heritage In 1861 Dakota Territory was created by the Congress of the United States to include the present states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and the northern half of Wyoming. Homesteading began in 1868, and Texas cowmen moved longhorn cattle to great open-range spreads in that portion of the territory known as \"Little Missouri Country.\" By 1872 the Northern Pacific Railway had reached Jamestown. In the part of the territory that is now western North Dakota, a French nobleman, the Marquis de Mores, ranched and built a meat packing plant; another Frenchman, Pierre Wibaux, started a ranching operation that was to become the largest in the United States; and a young man from New York, Theodore \"Old Four Eyes\" Roosevelt, began a career that was to take him to the White House. Amid this excitement and growth, dedicated Presbyterian settlers met to discuss the founding of a college. The first liberal arts college in the area, University of Jamestown was incorporated in 1883 and chartered in 1884 under sponsorship of the Presbyterian Church, which recognized its responsibility to \"promote the progress of our divine religion and to maintain and improve Christian citizenship, believing that these objects cannot be attained without the proper education of our youth under Christian influences.\" The first classes at University of Jamestown began in September of 1886, three years before North Dakota became a state. By the end of the University's second year, eighty-two students were pursuing degrees under the tutelage of five professors. Physical facilities were meager and circumstances difficult on the open prairie. The college hill had only one building and a barn for horses. Wood stoves furnished heat and oil lamps provided light. The extremely cold winter of 1886 contributed to the onset of economic problems. After closing during the financial panic of 1893, the University was reopened in 1909 by the North Dakota Synod under the leadership of President Barend H. Kroeze. Dr. Kroeze was to set in motion forces that would allow the University to grow and prosper as it \"encouraged the development of an educated Christian citizenship\" and sought \"to offer a liberal culture combined with moral training.\" The current 110 acres of wooded land the campus now occupies bears little resemblance to the bleak site upon which the founders stood and pondered the future of their own lives and that of a fledgling college. Today, University of Jamestown overlooks a progressive city of sixteen thousand people which offers a variety of recreational facilities and warm hospitality. Modern facilities now grace \"College Hill,\" including the architectural prize-winning Raugust Library, which houses more than 150,000 items; Larson Center; Seibold and Prentice residence halls; Lyngstad Center, a modern classroom facility; the Reiland Fine Arts Center, with its exceptional concert/performance hall; the Unruh and Sheldon Center for Business and Computer Science; the Ed and Elaine Nafus Student Center; the Foss Center; the remodeled Liechty Center-Taber Hall; the McKenna Thielsch Center with its nursing and science labs; and the Harold Newman Arena. The University also completed a 13,350 square foot building in Fargo to house the Doctor of Physical Therapy Program, which matriculated its first class in the fall of 2013. In January 2021 the University divided into the Undergraduate College and the College of Graduate and Professional Studies. The Undergraduate College is the home to all the undergraduate programs of study housed on The Mission and History of the University of Jamestown 6| University of Jamestown Undergraduate College Catalog the Jamestown campus. The graduate programs are in the College of Graduate and Professional Studies along with the University's online undergraduate programs. Only the University's objectives have remained unchanged. These are reaffirmed in our goal of academic excellence in a Christian environment and in our determination to equip our students to face new problems and challenges in a changing world. Those objectives are realized not only through a quality faculty and curriculum but also through outstanding facilities and co-curricular programs, such as athletics, choir, and drama. We believe a Christian environment is crucial to the educational process. It provides discipline to the development and freedom of the mind and imparts a spiritual dimension of hope and grace. University of Jamestown and the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA) have an historical relationship, and they maintain their relationship by a covenant agreement to support one another in their respective missions. Foundational Values As an institution of higher education in the Presbyterian tradition, we celebrate God through the use of our minds and the exercise of reason, believing that God is the source of all truth. \"You shall love the Lord our God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind\" (Matthew 22:37). Our Christian and Reformed tradition embraces the liberal arts and the ongoing search for knowledge and truth as a way of liberating the human spirit and of understanding the world we share with others. University of Jamestown promotes education as a means to improve lives, search for vocation, and create lifelong seekers of truth and wisdom. We value the life of the mind and the life of the spirit and therefore hold that faith and reason reinforce each other and that through mind, heart, and hands one can honor God and serve humanity. Historically, this strong belief that learning and the search for truth are closely connected to faith formed the basis for the Presbyterian Church's early and significant commitment to higher education. As a result, prior to the Civil War, one-fourth of the colleges in the United States were Presbyterian. In 1883, when the Presbyterian Church extended its mission into the Dakota Territory's frontier, University of Jamestown was founded in a newly incorporated city ninety miles west of Fargo. University of Jamestown is a fully independent, self- governing institution that shares an historic relationship with the Presbyterian Church (USA). We are proudly non-sectarian and welcome students of all faiths and beliefs. Our Latin motto, \"Lux et Veritas,\" proclaims to all that the pursuit of truth lights our journey today as it has since 1883. The Jamestown Journey to Success With the first class of their first semester, University of Jamestown students begin a journey\u2014a journey to success. The metaphor of the journey is apt because it reminds both students and those working with them to keep thinking about where the chosen path will lead. We want each student to make the most of his or her four years at the University of Jamestown. And as with any journey, the best way to make the most of it is to keep one's eyes open in order to see as much as possible. Therefore, the Jamestown Journey to Success emphasizes the importance of looking: Students Look Inward through examining their own interests, strengths, goals, and dreams. This begins in UJ Foundations where students meet in small groups each week with a faculty/staff teacher and an upper-class student guide. Teachers and guides provide the students with analytic instruments and hold discussions to help them think carefully about what they want to accomplish both inside and outside the classroom during the next four years. This results in thoughtful choices of major and minor areas of study as well as involvement in co- curricular activities. Students Look Outward by asking how to take the talents and strengths they have identified and use them not only to accomplish their own goals but to serve those around them. All students at the University of Jamestown do community service. Students also have the chance to help others distant from the college through mission trips with groups such as Habitat for Humanity and the Presbyterian Church in Kenya or to serve those in our own community through groups like Students of Service, Champions of Character, and many others. Students Look Beyond in order to learn about people, cultures, and ways of life different than their own. This happens through overseas travel to places like China, Costa Rica, Kenya, or Italy or within the U.S. to cities like Minneapolis, Chicago, or New York. But travel is not the only way to learn about new ideas and diverse perspectives; right on our own campus students can take advantage of International Week, Foreign Film Festivals, or interaction with international students. Students Look Forward as they make use of college resources to prepare themselves for that next step into the The Mission and History of the University of Jamestown| 7 world of work or further graduate study. Career Services offers student individual assistance in searching for a job or selecting a graduate school. University programs allow students to choose among a wide range of sessions on topics such as networking, interviewing, business etiquette, resume writing, applying to graduate school, and many more. The Jamestown Journey is our way of ensuring that each student's journey fits his or her needs, helps meet the needs of others, and leads to a successful future. The Journey also includes a co-curricular transcript for students who want them. There are very few times in students' lives when they will be surrounded by so many others dedicated to helping them reach their goals as during the years of their journey at the University of Jamestown.

The assessment process is guided by the foundational values and the mission of the University. To clarify this connection, 15 institutional objectives provide linkage between program outcomes and the university mission. These are listed below. Institutional Objectives University of Jamestown: Student Learning maintains academic, professional, and pre- professional programs that prepare students for entry into the work force or for further education; (Academic Preparation) provides undergraduate students with a general education curriculum rooted in the liberal arts to improve critical thinking skills and increase general knowledge; (General Education) offers co-curricular opportunities to develop wholeness in students as they learn and grow on a personal, social and civic level; (Engagement) provides opportunities for students to learn basic ethical principles, serve others, and to engage in character-building activities; (Character Building) provides support services to assist students in achieving their academic and career goals; (Academic Support Services) fosters an appreciation of difference through the integration of curricular and co-curricular experiences that are intentionally developed to help students integrate into a global society; (Diversity) provides opportunities for students to be involved in Christian religious life activities and to explore their faith; (Christian Life/Religious Life Environment) Community Engagement recognizes and fosters opportunities to connect with, integrate into, and participate and serve in the larger communities in which it resides; (Community) demonstrates its commitment to continuous improvement through discipline-specific and pedagogical faculty development; (Faculty Development) demonstrates its commitment to continuous improvement through staff development; (Staff Development) maintains mutually beneficial relationships with alumni and institutional friends; (Development) operates within a system of shared governance in which the opinions and values of constituents contribute to decisions and responsibility for success is shared; (Shared Governance) Stewardship and Fiscal Integrity uses current technology to enhance student learning, administrative efficiency, and institutional effectiveness; (Technology) maintains the infrastructure necessary to support both the academic program and student life; (Infrastructure) manages financial resources to support its objectives and strategies in a manner that ensures the institution's viability in the short- and long terms; (Sound Fiscal Management) Assessment Activities A partial list of assessment activities follows: 1. administration of the Ruffalo Noel Levitz Student Satisfaction Inventory, Adult Student Priorities Survey, and Priorities Survey for Online Learners; 2. administration of standardized testing to graduating seniors in selected departments (e.g. MFT); graduating seniors complete these assessments as required by certain departments; 3. analysis of reported performance on graduate and professional school examinations (including the Pre- Professional Skills Test and the Praxis II in Education); the Medical College Admission Test, the Law School Admission Test, and the National Assessment Assessment| 11 Council Licensure Examination in Nursing; 4. internal academic program reviews rotating all departments on a 5-year basis, with periodic external reviews; 5. analysis of placement information based on alumni surveys; 6. administration of a faculty and staff survey to gain knowledge of the opinion of faculty and staff about the institution; 7. analysis of exit surveys from graduating seniors and classroom assessment summaries from every academic department; 8. analysis of student retention, experiential education, career planning between education and career; 9. linking assessment results to program development, and; 10. an ongoing evaluation of our assessment program. While formal and informal reports from alumni, employers, trustees and other constituencies comprise additional information relevant to assessment, student input constitutes the critical source of assessment data. Therefore, all students will be expected at various junctures during their tenure at University of Jamestown to contribute to our assessment program by completing surveys, standardized tests, and exit surveys as required by their curriculum. Watermark The University of Jamestown utilizes Watermark products, a suite of web-based assessment systems, to capture data from rubrics, course evaluations, satisfaction surveys, field experience evaluations, and other electronic assessment tools. Reports on these data contribute to our assessment of program outcomes and institutional objectives by providing valuable insight into student learning, faculty performance, campus life, and much more. For questions or guidance contact: Anna Munns Engdahl Director of Institutional Effectiveness amunns@uj.edu 701-356-9204 12| University of Jamestown Undergraduate College Catalog Academic Advising The academic advising program allows students to explore and develop educational plans appropriate to their life goals and aspirations. All incoming freshmen are registered in UJ Foundations. The course is designed to familiarize first-year students with University of Jamestown and college life in general. The course places particular emphasis on assisting students to \"look inward\" and to evaluate their strengths in order to help them form clear educational goals and a sense of vocation. Students may declare a major when applying to the university or at any time before graduation by submitting that request to the Registrar's office. Faculty advisors in the major area of interest are assigned to the student when the major is declared. Faculty advisors are available to assist in the planning of class schedules, the selection of concentrations within a department, and offer personal guidance to students as they progress in their educational plans. This also enables students to develop an ongoing relationship with faculty members. Academic Integrity Policy At the University of Jamestown, we operate in an atmosphere of mutual trust between and among instructors and students. Sometimes this trust is violated through the intentional or accidental misrepresentation of facts, ideas, or data by members of the academic community. Such misrepresentations are violations of the Academic Integrity Policy. There are three main types of violations: cheating, inappropriate collaboration, and plagiarism. Cheating involves the misrepresentation of knowledge or experience. For example, if students use unauthorized materials during an examination (for instance, by looking at other students' exams, obtaining the questions in advance, and so on) they are falsely representing themselves as having recalled material or reasoned correctly, when, in fact, they did not. If students fake the data in a laboratory experiment, they are falsely suggesting that they acquired information in accordance with prescribed procedures. Inappropriate collaboration involves presenting academic work as one's independent effort when it includes significant elements of the work of others. When important ideas or actual phrasings in an academic work belong to an unnamed colleague, misrepresentation has occurred. It is dishonest for one student to write some or all of another student's paper or presentation. It is equally wrong for one student to develop key ideas for a project that is represented as the work of another. Inappropriate collaboration is a violation for which both or all parties will be held accountable. Plagiarism involves both theft and cheating. When someone appropriates, for use in formal course work, the wording, phrasing, or ideas of another, and either accidentally or intentionally fails to acknowledge the debt, it is considered theft. Plagiarism is also cheating in that one is creating a false impression about one's own intelligence, ability, and achievement. If students are unsure about what constitutes plagiarism, they should seek help from their instructors, the Writing Center, and refer to appropriate handbooks. Disciplinary Process It is the responsibility of every member of the University of Jamestown community to maintain the integrity of the grading system; anyone with knowledge of violations of the Academic Integrity Policy must report this information to a faculty member, a member of the university staff or administration, or the Undergraduate Dean. All cases of academic dishonesty must be reported to the Undergraduate Dean, who will maintain records on each student who has committed a violation of the policy. Students who violate the Academic Integrity Policy of the University of Jamestown will be subject to disciplinary action. A course instructor who suspects a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy should inform the student of his/her suspicion and present him/her with the evidence, allowing the student an opportunity for rebuttal. Upon determination of a violation, the course instructor will decide the penalty to be imposed. Depending on the severity of the infraction, this may involve a requirement to complete the assignment again, failing the student for the assignment, or failing the student for the course. If a dispute arises between a course instructor and a student about whether a violation has been committed, it is to be referred to the Undergraduate Dean for resolution no later than three weeks from the end of the semester in which the dispute occurred. If the Provost determines that no General Policies and Services General Policies and Services| 13 question exists, the appeal process is terminated. If any question remains, the Undergraduate Dean may refer it to the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate for a hearing. The decision of the Executive Committee of the Faculty Senate about the commission of an offense will be final in all such cases. If a student involved in a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy is not enrolled in a particular instructor's course, as in a case of inappropriate collaboration, the instructor should inform the Undergraduate Dean of the case for appropriate disciplinary action. In the case of multiple violations of the Academic Integrity Policy by a student, the Provost may impose additional sanctions, Undergraduate Dean may include academic warning, academic probation, academic suspension, or expulsion. If any question remains, the Undergraduate Dean may refer it to the Executive Committee of the faculty for a hearing. The decision of the Executive Committee of the faculty will be final in all such cases. Alcohol Use The use of alcohol on campus or at student University functions is prohibited without official consent from the Office of the President and the Office of Student Affairs. Under North Dakota law, alcoholic beverages are prohibited to anyone under twenty-one years of age. Procuring alcoholic beverages for a minor is a felony offense. Appealing Grades and Other Academic Matters not Pertaining to Academic Integrity Issues A student may appeal the grade she or he received in a course. Grounds for an appeal are limited to capriciousness, errors of fact, or evidence of bias on the part of the instructor, and it is the responsibility of the student to provide evidence that an appeal is warranted. The belief that an instructor graded in too difficult a manner, assigned too much work for a given course, and the like, are not grounds for a grade appeal. Grades on individual assignments, tests, or other measures of student learning are not appealable except to the extent that they affect the final grade a student received in a course. Students wishing to appeal grades or other academic matters not related to academic integrity issues should follow this timeline and process: 1. Discuss the concern with the faculty member involved no later than two weeks into the beginning of the subsequent semester of the issuance of the final grade to initiate an appeal (into the fall semester for spring semester and summer term courses and into the spring semester for fall semester courses). If the student remains unsatisfied or if the instructor is separated from the University, the student should: 2. Appeal to the department chairperson in writing within five working days of discussing the grievance with the faculty member. Include the circumstances of the grievance, specific concerns, and a possible remedy. The student should make an appointment and meet with the chairperson. It is the responsibility of the department chair to collect evidence from the student and the faculty member, if the faculty member is not separated from the university, prior to making a decision. The student will be notified in writing of the chairpersons' decision within five working days of the meeting. If the student remains unsatisfied or if the faculty member who issued the grade is the department chairperson, the student should: 3. Appeal to the Undergraduate Dean in writing within five working days of notification by the chairperson's decision. Include in the written document circumstances of the grievance, specific concerns, and a possible remedy. The student should make an appointment and meet with the Undergraduate Dean. It is the responsibility of the Undergraduate Dean to collect evidence from the student, faculty member, if the faculty member is not separated from the university, and the department chair prior to making a decision. The student will be notified in writing of the Undergraduate Dean's decision. In all cases, the decision of the Undergraduate Dean is final. In cases where no evidence of capriciousness, errors in fact, or bias exist, the original grade will remain. In cases where evidence of capriciousness, errors in fact, or bias does exist, either the department chairperson or the Undergraduate Dean will administratively change the grade to a more appropriate grade and notify the instructor of the grade change within five business days of the notification. Auditing Students must register for all classes they wish to audit. No credit is given for a class that is audited. Students must observe normal attendance requirements; however, they are not required to take tests or submit term papers. 14| University of Jamestown Undergraduate College Catalog Students have until 60% of the length of the course has been completed to declare the course for audit. Career Service and Experiential Education The Office of Career Services and Experiential Education serves all UJ students and alumni in a variety of ways. The primary responsibilities of Career Services are to provide career planning and job search preparation services to students and alumni. Experiential Education assists students in exploring and locating field experiences such as internships and cooperative education, job shadows, volunteer work, consulting projects, curricular and optional practical training for international students, and study abroad opportunities. Students and alumni may visit the center on a walk-in basis or by appointment.

Even when parents are involved in requesting services, it is primarily the student's responsibility to initiate the request. 2. A newly accepted or currently enrolled student whose learning disability requires reasonable accommodation may make a request for accommodation at any time. Because the arrangements for some accommodations take a significant amount of time, the student should make a request as early as possible. 3. To be considered as a student with a learning disability under the law, the individual is responsible for providing relevant written documentation that substantiates his or her claim. The University and the Law The University upholds municipal, state, and federal laws and cooperates fully with all law enforcement agencies.

The majority of our full-time students participate in one or more of the financial aid programs available through the University. The admission and financial aid staff will work to prepare an individual package to fit the needs of each student. The Office of Financial Aid awards aid based on demonstrated need while most merit and talent-based awards are determined by other departments such as admission, athletics, and fine arts. Admission, Cost, and Financial Aid Policies and Information| 23 Application Procedure Federal financial aid may be available for students who qualify. More information can be found online at www.studentaid.gov or on the UJ Financial Aid Office website. Students may also contact the UJ Financial Aid Office with questions. All students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) every year to be considered for need based aid. The FAFSA can be completed online at www.studentaid.ed.gov. The Office of Financial Aid may require the FAFSA to be completed in other instances as well. North Dakota Residents Residents of North Dakota who have graduated from a North Dakota high school may be eligible for a variety of scholarships or grants made available through the North Dakota University System. Additional information for each of the following programs that are administered by the North Dakota University System can be found at www.ndus.edu/paying-for-college/. Satisfactory Academic Progress Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) is language set forth in the federal guidelines [34 CFR \u00a7668.34] that specifies the minimum academic progress required of a student to avoid termination of funding provided by federal and state governments. The guidelines also relate to programs funded by the institution (except for tuition waivers) or as determined by the University of Jamestown (UJ). The academic standards for students receiving Title IV funds (federal aid) are the same as those for students not receiving Title IV funds. To demonstrate SAP for financial aid purposes, all students must comply with the following components: 1. QUALITATIVE Students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0. 2. PACE OR QUANTITATIVE Students must successfully complete (grade of 'D' or higher) at least 67% of all attempted credits. Grades of incomplete on the last day of the term are included in the calculation and not recalculated for that term once the grade is entered. Credit hours from another school accepted at UJ will count as both attempted and completed hours. 3. MAXIMUM TIMEFRAME OR 150% RULE Students must complete their program within 150% of the total credits required for completion. Monitoring Procedure The University of Jamestown monitors student progress after every payment period (term). Summer is considered a payment period for this purpose and, consequently, progress will be monitored for those students enrolled in summer school courses after the summer session as well. Possible statuses of each SAP calculation are good standing, warning, and suspension. A student who fails SAP after one semester is placed on financial aid warning. A student who fails SAP the next consecutive semester after being placed on warning will be placed on financial aid suspension. A student placed on financial aid suspension may appeal the suspension by submitting an official Financial Aid Suspension Appeal Form (which can be found on the University of Jamestown website under Current Students/Financial) by the stated deadline. A committee composed of the Associate Provost/Dean of the Undergraduate College, Vice-President of Enrollment Management, Registrar, the Student Success Coordinator, and the Director of Financial Aid will review the appeal. If an appeal is granted by a majority vote of the committee, an academic plan will be generated for the student. The student and financial aid representative will sign the academic plan. Students will be notified of SAP statuses of warning and suspension by email to their UJ email and by postal letter to their legal, home, permanent address, and by email of a status of academic plan. If appropriate, requirements necessary to regain eligibility for financial aid will be included. Additional Information Limited funding may be available through private sources explicitly stating that SAP is not required. The Financial Aid Office reserves the right to adjust SAP verbiage at any time. Grades of incomplete will be counted as not earned in the calculation immediately following the term in which the grade falls. If the grade changes to a letter grade, that grade will be considered in future calculations for SAP. A course in which a student received a passing grade may be repeated only one time for federal student aid payment of both times the course was taken. Federal student aid may not be used for a second repeat of the 24| University of Jamestown Undergraduate College Catalog same course with a passing grade (D or higher). All course repeats count toward the total number of credits the student has attempted, which may affect pace and/or 150% calculations for SAP. Return of Title IV Funds and Institutional Charge Policy for Withdrawals Institutional Charge Policy for Withdrawals Residential Programs: University of Jamestown has adopted a tuition charge policy for the residential programs that uses the same methodology as the Return of Title IV Funds Policy. This policy refers to withdrawal from the University of Jamestown, not to withdrawal from an individual course. Fee charges must be paid in full, regardless of the date of withdrawal. Housing and food charges are based on the date the student discontinues living on campus. Online Programs: University of Jamestown has adopted a tuition charge policy for the online programs. This policy refers to a withdrawal from either the University of Jamestown or an individual course. Students who participate and withdraw during the first week of the module will incur a 25% tuition charge. After week one, students will be responsible for the entire tuition charge for the module. Fee charges must be paid in full, regardless of the date of withdrawal. Students who do not participate and withdraw during the first week of the module will not incur a tuition or fee charge. A student is considered enrolled for attendance purposes until he/she has officially withdrawn from the University of Jamestown (see Official Withdrawal (p. 32)) or until the end of the term, whichever is first. The minimum amounts to be returned to Title IV programs are calculated according to federal guidelines. Detailed information is provided to each student every year and is available on request in the Financial Aid Office as well as on the University website.

After this period a student may not withdraw from a course unless there exist reasons clearly beyond the control of the student, and the student has petitioned the Undergraduate Dean for approval to withdraw. Students who do not withdraw by the deadline will receive a grade for the course in accordance with their performance in the course. Students who stop attending a class without officially dropping will receive a failing (F) grade. Adequate Progress toward a Degree and Academic Standing Students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0, which is the university definition of \"adequate progress toward a degree.\" Students are subject to academic sanction w henever both of the following conditions are met: \u00b7 Student is registered for at least 6 credits (half-time) in a semester. \u00b7 In that semester, the student's semester and/or cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0. For the purposes of this policy, the university identifies fall term, spring term, and summer term as \"semesters.\" Academic Warning A student is placed on academic warning when his/her semester GPA drops below the level defined above as \"adequate progress.\" The student will be removed from academic warning status whenever his/her semester and cumulative GPA return to the level required for adequate progress. Academic warning notifies a student that he/she has a GPA that might impede his/her ability to meet graduation requirements. Academic warning status does not restrict course load, eligibility for intercollegiate athletics, or the right to hold student office. It does specifically render the student ineligible for directed/independent studies. Academic Probation A student is placed on academic probation when the student has been on academic warning status for one semester and has failed in the following semester to raise his/her semester GPA to the level required for adequate progress. The University, however, reserves the right to place a student on probation without a previous semester on warning. A student will be removed from academic probation when his/her semester GPA return to the level required for adequate progress. However, a student will remain on academic warning until his/her cumulative GPA returns to the level required for adequate progress toward a degree. While on probation, the student is ineligible for intercollegiate athletics, and the course load is restricted \u2014 unless otherwise stated \u2014 to thirteen semester credits. In addition, the student on probation is ineligible for directed/independent studies and may be required to accept academic counseling. Academic Suspension A student is placed on academic suspension after he/she Academic Policies and Procedures 28| University of Jamestown Undergraduate College Catalog has been on academic probation for one semester and has failed in the following semester to raise his/her semester and cumulative GPA to the level required for adequate progress. The University, however, reserves the right to suspend a student without a prior semester on academic probation. The suspension is one term in length and is usually served in the term immediately following the suspension. However, students suspended at the end of the spring term will serve the suspension in the fall. Academic probation may be continued in lieu of suspension if the University of Jamestown cumulative grade point average improves but is below that required for good standing, providing the semester average is at or above adequate progress level. A student who has been suspended may request re- admittance to the University of Jamestown after serving the suspension. His or her status will be reviewed by the Undergraduate Dean and the Vice President for Student Affairs. The student will be notified whether he or she will be re-admitted on academic probation or denied admission. Attendance The participation of students in all regularly scheduled classes is considered an important part of the academic procedure. It is assumed that students will conscientiously fulfill this responsibility when classes are scheduled and will contribute to class activities. An instructor may consider irregular attendance in his/her evaluation of students' education achievement. Students are responsible for ascertaining attendance requirements for each course in which they are enrolled. Specific policies related to excused and unexcused absences can be found in the Student Handbook. Classification of Students Official classification of students is determined by the registrar as follows: Freshman: fewer than 30 semester credits Sophomore: a minimum of 30 semester credits and a maximum of 59 semester credits Junior: a minimum of 60 semester credits and a maximum of 89 semester credits Senior: a minimum of 90 semester credits Consortium Agreement The United States Department of Education requires that a written consortium agreement exists between two federally eligible institutions whereby a student desires to take courses at the student's non-degree granting institution. When a consortium agreement is necessary, the financial aid administrators of the two institutions will sign an appropriate agreement. All transcripts for courses taken on a consortium agreement will be transferred to the University of Jamestown at face value. Credit by Examination Programs for credit by examination include the following: Advanced Placement Tests or College Entrance Examination Board (CEEB) These tests are accepted to satisfy the University of Jamestown's equivalent course requirements. A grade of three (3) or higher is required for gaining credit on the basis of these examinations. Course equivalency is determined by the registrar in collaboration with the appropriate academic department chair. Students who have completed the English Literature and Composition AP test with a grade of three (3) or higher will be placed in English 102 on the basis of the test. Challenge Program The Challenge Program is designed to free the well- prepared student from taking courses in which he or she has already gained competence. The Undergraduate Dean and department chair shall determine the availability of challenge examinations for courses. A student wishing to challenge a course shall make arrangements through, and seek advice of, the relevant department. Credit is granted for courses successfully challenged at C- level or better. A grade of P is assigned that does not affect the student's grade point average. A non-refundable fee will be assessed for each challenge (see Costs: Miscellaneous Fees). A student may not challenge a course that he or she has already taken for credit, nor may the same course be challenged more than once. Challenge application forms are available in the Registrar's Office. CLEP (College Level Examination Program) Students may earn credit by CLEP examination at the University of Jamestown. General examinations and subject examinations are administered on campus by Academic Policies and Procedures| 29 appointment. Inquiries should be directed to the Career Center in Raugust Library. Students may not repeat by CLEP exam a course previously taken unless this is specifically approved by the department chair in that discipline. For more CLEP information go to www.collegeboard.com/CLEP. Credit Hour Policy The University of Jamestown follows the \"Carnegie Definition\" of credit hour. The practice has been 50 minutes of class, plus a minimum of 2 hours out of classroom study for each credit earned. Courses were all developed under this practice. As graduate programs were added, the definition was articulated in the graduate bulletins, beginning with the DPT program in 2013. In the 2017-18 academic year, the policy for graduate and undergraduate credit hours was written as the practice has been following the \"Carnegie Definition.\" Graduate Credit Hour Policy DPT and MSCC (Laboratory-based programs): A unit of credit (one credit hour) is defined as the equivalent of one 50-minute class period per week for one semester with a minimum of two hours of additional work outside of class meeting time for each hour in class. Hence, a three-credit course would require the equivalent of 45-hours of class time and 90-hours of outside work. Since graduate students are expected to be capable of more independent work, fewer class hours and more outside of class work may make up the equivalency referred to above. In the case of laboratories, for the measurement of a credit hour, one credit hour may be equivalent to two to three laboratory hours. PhD in Clinical Research, MEd, and MAL (Non- laboratory-based programs): A unit of credit (one credit hour) is defined as the equivalent of one fifty-minute class period per week for one semester with a minimum of two hours of additional work outside of class meeting time for each hour in class. Hence, a three-credit course would require the equivalent of forty-five hours of class time and ninety hours of outside work. Since graduate students are expected to be capable of more independent work, fewer class hours and more outside class work may make up the equivalency referred to above. Undergraduate Credit Hour Policy A unit of credit (one credit hour) is defined as the equivalent of one 50-minute class period per week for one semester with a minimum of two hours of additional work outside of class meeting time for each hour in class, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time. For laboratory and lessons, measurement of credit hours varies and may be equivalent to one credit to \u00bd -3 hours in lab or lessons. For internships, practicums and student teaching, credits awarded based on average hours per week with 40 hours per 1 credit including 2 or more hours of additional coursework. Details of the policy: 50 minutes of in-class or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester hour of credit. This accounts for approximately 15 hours of in-class or direct faculty instruction and minimum of 30 hours of out-of-class student work for a total of approximately 45 hours for one semester hour of credit; or The equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or The equivalent amount of work by other instructional modes of delivery such as distance education (online), independent and directed studies. Laboratory : Practical application type courses where the major focus is on 'hands on' experience to support student learning using equipment, activities, tools, machines etc. 1 credit hour is approximately 2-3 laboratory hours. Applied Music Lessons : Courses are individual lessons which meet once per week. Students receive 1-2 credits with lessons lasting 30-60 minutes. Additional independent practice is expected. Internship : a pre-professional practical learning experience in an appropriate work environment that will benefit the student. 1 credit per 40 hours of internship, with an additional 2 hours or more of coursework, not to exceed 8 credits in one experience with the exception of student teaching. Online Credit Hour Policy Federal Guidelines mandate that one credit hour is equivalent to 3 hours of student work (Every week for 15 weeks). In the online accelerated (8 week) environment, this translates to approximately 6 hours of student engagement per week per credit for a total of 18 hours per week for a three-credit course. Student work includes preparation time, reading, research, discussion board participation, assignments, exams and practical application of materials. 30| University of Jamestown Undergraduate College Catalog Directed/Independent Studies and Special Topics Directed and independent studies are non-classroom programs of study, arranged for and undertaken by a student under the supervision of a faculty member and at the discretion of that faculty member. Such studies must be judged to be of substantial weight, equal to or exceeding the merit, time, and attention given to a classroom course of equivalent credit. All directed and independent study courses must be approved by the student's faculty advisor, the department chair, and by the Dean. Directed Study courses are individualized offerings of courses currently approved and listed in the Undergraduate College Catalog. These are often offered to assist a student in resolving a serious scheduling conflict outside of his/her control that cannot be resolved by other means. Independent Study are individualized courses that allow a student to work with a faculty member to do research beyond what is offered in the normal curriculum. Directed and independent studies are subject to the following requirements: 1. Contact hours: A directed study must have scheduled faculty-student contact hours equal to at least one third of the contact hours of a classroom course of equivalent credit. Contact hours for an independent study are at the instructing faculty member's discretion. 2. GPA: A student taking a directed study must have a GPA of at least 2.75. A student taking an independent study must have a GPA of at least 3.5. 3. Class standing: Students taking directed or independent studies must have completed at least twenty-four college semester credits. 4. A student who has received a D or F in a course may not take a directed or independent study in order to replace the grade for that course. Special Topics are classroom-based courses for topics outside the normal curriculum. These are often used to address new questions in a field or to test whether the course should be approved for permanent listing in the catalog. Eligibility Student organization offices are restricted to full-time students who are not on academic probation. Athletic eligibility is granted only to students who are not on academic probation and who meet the standards of the Great Plains Athletic Conference. Exceptions to Academic Regulations Academic regulations exist in order to ensure integrity and fairness in the academic programs of the University. Therefore, exceptions to academic regulations will be granted only when there are extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control that justify special consideration. If a student believes that such circumstances exist, he or she may petition for an exception to an academic regulation. The petition process is outlined below: 1. The student completes the Academic Petition form found in the Student tab in MyUJ, stating clearly the reasons for the request and providing any supporting evidence. 2. The student submits the completed form, either in electronic or physical format, to the Undergraduate Dean. 3. The Undergraduate Dean considers the petition, and if he/she deems it necessary, consults with the Curricular Council. 4. The Undergraduate Dean approves or denies the petition and returns the petition with an explanation to the Registrar who informs the student of the decision. Grade Point Average (GPA) The University of Jamestown grade point average (GPA) is used to determine academic standing. The GPA is computed by dividing total grade points earned by the total number of semester credits attempted in which the student received a grade of A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, or F. (Exception: If a course is repeated, only the higher grade is included in the GPA calculation; however, the lower grade remains on the transcript as well.) Grade points awarded per semester credit are the following: Academic Policies and Procedures| 31 A+ = 4.00 A = 4.00 A- = 3.67 B+ = 3.33 B = 3.00 B- = 2.67 C+ = 2.33 C = 2.00 C- = 1.67 D+ = 1.33 D = 1.00 D- = 0.67 F = 0.00 Grades of P, W, and I (Incomplete) do not affect the grade point average. Two grade point averages are maintained for transfer students: The University of Jamestown GPA and an overall GPA that includes transfer credit. The overall GPA is also used in determining eligibility for scholarships and for all academic honors (other criteria beyond GPA may exist in some cases.) Grade points are rounded to the nearest one- thousandth. Grades Tentative grades are reported at midterm to assist students in gauging their effort for the remainder of the term. At the completion of each course the student is given a grade: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, or P for passing work; I for incomplete work; and F for failure. Incomplete Grades The grade \"incomplete\" is given only at the end of a term in which the student, for justifiable reasons in the opinion of the professor, is unable to complete the course. If an incomplete course is not completed within four weeks of the next semester after the grade was given, or if an incomplete course is not completed within one semester by a student not in residence, the grade will be that which the professor submitted based on the assumption that the student received failing grades or zero points for all uncompleted work. Exceptions to this rule will be made only when there exist reasons clearly beyond the control of the student, and the student, with the professor's approval, has petitioned the office of Dean for an extension of time. The Dean may grant an extension of time or a replacement of the incomplete with a W (Withdrawn). No final action will be taken until the four-week period has elapsed. Pass-Fail Option Twelve elective credits may be taken on a pass-fail basis. Courses taken on a pass-fail basis cannot be courses that contribute to major, minor, or general education requirements. No more than one class may be taken on this basis during any given term. No more than twelve semester credits of pass-fail work may be counted toward the satisfaction of graduation requirements (student teaching and internships are the exception). Students taking a course on a pass-fail basis must attend all classes, take all examinations and possess all prerequisites required of students enrolling on a letter grade basis. Performance of A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D- caliber will be awarded a grade of \"Pass,\" which does not affect the grade point average. Grades of F are included in the computation of the grade point average. Students may elect (or reverse) the pass-fail option until two weeks after mid-term for semester-long courses, and until the fifth week of an eight- week course. Grading of Experiential Education and Internships All experiential education and internship credits will be graded Pass/Fail. If participation is not a requirement for a major or minor, it will contribute to the twelve-credit maximum for Pass/Fail. If participation is a requirement of a major or minor, it will be exempt from the twelve-credit limit (for example, student teaching.) Honors The Dean's List of Outstanding Scholars The dean's list of outstanding scholars includes all full- time students who at the end of any given semester earn a grade point average of 3.50 or better with a minimum of twelve semester credits, exclusive of \"Pass\" credits. College Fellows A limited number of outstanding junior and senior students are selected each year by the faculty for the distinction of College Fellow. Recipients are to be of exemplary character and must possess an overall cumulative grade point average of 3.3 or better as well as a grade point average of 3.50 or better in their majors. Fellows may tutor or teach under the direction of their department chair(s). Distinction in Degrees 32| University of Jamestown Undergraduate College Catalog Scholastic excellence is recognized with diploma designations as follows: Latin Honors: Summa Cum Laude - 3.90 GPA or higher Magna Cum Laude - 3.70 to 3.899 GPA Cum Laude - 3.50 to 3.699 GPA The honors-level grade point average must be maintained on both the University of Jamestown credits attempted and the cumulative grade point average, including all transfer credits. Honor Societies Students who qualify may join honor societies that have chapters at the University of Jamestown. Current honor societies are Alpha Chi (academic), Alpha Mu Gamma (foreign language), Beta, Beta, Beta (biology), Lambda Pi Eta (communication), Omicron Delta Kappa (leadership), Phi Lambda Theta (education), Psi Chi (psychology), and Sigma Theta Tau (nursing). Medical Withdrawal A student who has a medical condition that prevents her/him from completing all of the coursework in a given term may request a medical withdrawal from the Registrar's Office at any time during the term. In order for the request to be granted, documentation from a medical professional may be required and the medical condition must prevent the student from successfully completing all of her/his courses for the term. In the event that the request is approved, the student will receive a \"W\" for all of her/his courses for the term. If the request is made after the completion of 60% of the term, the student will receive no refund for tuition, fees, room, and board. Students who receive a medical withdrawal for a given term are not impacted in their ability to register for future terms unless already impacted by other policies, such as academic sanction. Official Withdrawal from University A student who must withdraw from college should obtain an \"Official Withdrawal\" form from the Student Success Coordinator. This form must be completed for official withdrawal from the University. An unofficial withdrawal results in failure in all courses. Registration Each student must enroll in all courses for which credit or audit recognition is desired and must assume the responsibility for being properly registered. No registration is permitted after the first ten business days of a 16-week term, or after the first five days of an 8-week term, without the permission of the Dean. Student Paper Retention Policy Faculty may dispose of papers, projects, quizzes, exams, or other materials that remain unclaimed or unexamined by the student on the last day of classes of the next semester. Transfer Courses All students enrolled at the University of Jamestown who wish to complete courses at other academic institutions and to transfer those courses for credit to the University of Jamestown must have those courses pre-approved through the Registrar's office. For general education and elective courses, the Registrar's office will determine whether a transfer course corresponds in content and quality to a University of Jamestown course. For courses in a student's major, that determination is made by the relevant department chair. A minimal expectation is that the course in question comes from an institution that is accredited by a CHEA approved regional accrediting association of schools and colleges that offers either associate or bachelor's degrees. Student Engagement Opportunities and Services| 33 Student Engagement Opportunities University of Jamestown strives to offer a wide variety of opportunities for students to become engaged during this time in college.

General Education| 45 Overview The general education requirements at the University of Jamestown represent the faculty's best judgment regarding the knowledge and skills that any college-educated person should have. We believe that a broad general education program including exposure to diverse academic disciplines helps students in many ways. For example, such a program 1. provides students with information that assists them in choosing a major or minor area of study 2. encourages students to interact with faculty members and students outside their own disciplines 3. stimulates students to think about issues and ideas of which they were previously unaware 4. enables students to make cross-disciplinary connections 5. prepares students to better understand written and oral discussions in which they will participate. In addition to supporting these wider goals, however, our general education program is designed to help students meet eleven more specific outcomes that we deem important for college-educated people: Aesthetic Awareness : Graduates will recognize the role of aesthetic expression in daily life. Christian Literacy : Graduates will describe the basic tenets of the historic Christian faith and can explain the implications of those tenets for ethical living. Cultural and Social Literacy : Graduates will demonstrate a basic level of knowledge of the social sciences and humanities. Ethical Literacy : Graduates will describe and compare several major ethical theories and concepts to explain how these theories apply to particular issues, contexts, and communities. Global Awareness : Graduates will develop a broad world view and demonstrate knowledge of global issues and other nations and cultures. Information Literacy : Graduates will identify, evaluate, and apply information resources to specific tasks and use the appropriate citation method for their discipline. Quantitative Literacy : Graduates will perform mathematical computations and identify and draw inferences from relevant quantitative information. Scientific Literacy : Graduates will apply fundamental scientific principles and methods of inquiry and recognize the impact of scientific research and technology on individuals and the world. Oral Communication : Graduates will communicate effectively orally. Written Communication : Graduates will communicate effectively in writing. Critical Thinking : Graduates will be able to logically evaluate evidence, analyze and synthesize information from multiple sources, and reflect on varied perspectives.

Requirements Requirements for the Major in Civil Engineering While grades at or above a D- are considered by the university to be passing, the department of engineering wants to ensure that students are adequately prepared to succeed in their later coursework. Therefore, students who wish to take engineering courses with prerequisite requirements must earn at least a C- in the prerequisite course. Students who have earned D+, D, or D- in prerequisite courses may petition to take subsequent courses by writing a statement explaining why they should be able to take the subsequent course. The student's advisor, the instructor of the prerequisite course, and the instructor of the petitioned course will together make a determination as to whether the student will be able to continue. In the case where these roles overlap, a minimum of two faculty members need to consult. If all roles overlap or if the two faculty members don't agree, the department chair will also be consulted. If these roles still overlap or there is still disagreement, the request will be evaluated at the next department faculty meeting.

French Major Overview Mission Statement The mission of the Foreign Language Department at University of Jamestown is to help prepare the liberal arts student as a citizen of our global community. We seek to expose students to other languages and cultures, thereby broadening their concepts of language, civilization, culture, philosophy, government, religion, geography, art, aesthetics, and literature with a firm anchoring in a Christian perspective and academic excellence. In order to determine student progress toward these ends, the department assesses student learning and departmental effectiveness on a regular basis. Foreign Language Department Overview The Foreign Language Department of the University of Jamestown offers a wide range of language learning opportunities that allow students to continue to learn languages they began in high school or begin to learn new languages they first encounter at the university level. Majors are available in German, French, and Spanish to students who pursue a semester or two summers of study abroad; language minors in German, French, and Spanish can be completed on campus by students majoring in other subjects, and the interdisciplinary Italian Studies minor offers a combination of language, history, art, and study abroad to students majoring in other subjects as well. Courses in Portuguese, Romanian and Latin are also offered on demand. Placement and Advanced Standing in French, German and Spanish The first semester beginning courses in French, German, and Spanish are aimed at students with no prior instruction in those languages. A student who has completed high school course work in a foreign language is encouraged to Programs of Study - Majors| 103 consult with foreign language faculty members to receive advanced placement in a course beyond 101. Students who receive advanced placement into French, German, or Spanish 102 and complete the course with an earned grade of C- or higher will also receive three college credits for 101. Students who enroll directly in a 200-level French, German, or Spanish course will receive six advanced placement credits for language courses at the 101 and 102 levels when they complete the 200-level course with a C- or higher. The advanced standing credits count on the student's record but do not count as part of the semester course load. The credits count toward fulfilling general education requirements in the area of Global Perspectives. The advanced standing credits will be awarded at no charge to the student. The Foreign Language Department awards advanced standing credit for the German, French or Spanish 201 course requirement based on student performance on CLEP tests, which are administered through the Career Services. There is a charge for the CLEP exams. Majors in French, German, or Spanish The Foreign Language Department offers majors in French, German, and Spanish that require a minimum of twenty-four credit hours of coursework on campus or the equivalent thereof with 12-18 credit hours of advanced language study in the student's major language. The advanced credits will be gained during study abroad or participation in a US-based language immersion program. Students wishing to major in French, German, or Spanish must complete all courses leading to the minor at University of Jamestown, then take additional coursework in their study abroad to complete the major. Credits gained through advanced placement or CLEP exams will be counted as coursework leading to the minor. All external upper-division courses must be approved by the Foreign Language Department prior to the student's study abroad or participation in an immersion program. Courses in the exchange institution that will meet departmental approval include but are not limited to literature of the target language, film, linguistics, grammar and composition, history, communication and media studies, business, music history, and art history. Courses must be taught in the target language in order to be approved for the major. Successful completion of required coursework while enrolled in the exchange institution is a prerequisite for fulfilling requirements for the major. Students are expected to remain in contact with their on-campus language major advisors during the course of their study abroad. Students majoring in French, German, or Spanish may participate in an ISEP-sponsored study abroad program, or they may participate in approved summer immersion or study abroad programs (program list available upon request). Students majoring in Spanish may enroll in two summers of post-minor study in the MLSA-University of Jamestown Program at the University of Costa Rica in San Jose. All ISEP participants must present a minimum GPA of 2.75 at the time of application and be accepted into a program that offers the student's major language. The department recommends that students study abroad in their junior year. For more ISEP information, students may consult the ISEP section (p. 37) of this catalog. Courses in Classical and Biblical Languages Courses in New Testament Greek (REL 301, REL 302) fulfill the Global Perspectives general education requirement. The Religion Department also offers courses in Biblical Hebrew on request. The Foreign Language Department offers beginning Latin (FLAN 300) on request. Special Topics Courses Special Topics courses are offered at the 100 (beginning) and 200 (intermediate) levels in modern foreign languages that are not part of the departmental major or minor language curricula. These currently include beginning- level courses in Portuguese and Romanian. Special Topics courses at the 300- or 400-level can be offered in Spanish, French, or German. These courses are taught in the target language and can be used by students to replace any 300-level course for the minor or count toward the major.

German Major Overview Mission Statement The mission of the Foreign Language Department at University of Jamestown is to help prepare the liberal arts student as a citizen of our global community. We seek to expose students to other languages and cultures, thereby broadening their concepts of language, civilization, culture, philosophy, government, religion, geography, art, aesthetics, and literature with a firm anchoring in a Christian perspective and academic excellence. In order to determine student progress toward these ends, the department assesses student learning and departmental effectiveness on a regular basis. Foreign Language Department Overview The Foreign Language Department of the University of Jamestown offers a wide range of language learning opportunities that allow students to continue to learn languages they began in high school or begin to learn new languages they first encounter at the university level. Programs of Study - Majors| 105 Majors are available in German, French, and Spanish to students who pursue a semester or two summers of study abroad; language minors in German, French, and Spanish can be completed on campus by students majoring in other subjects, and the interdisciplinary Italian Studies minor offers a combination of language, history, art, and study abroad to students majoring in other subjects as well. Courses in Portuguese, Romanian and Latin are also offered on demand. Placement and Advanced Standing in French, German and Spanish The first semester beginning courses in French, German, and Spanish are aimed at students with no prior instruction in those languages. A student who has completed high school course work in a foreign language is encouraged to consult with foreign language faculty members to receive advanced placement in a course beyond 101. Students who receive advanced placement into French, German, or Spanish 102 and complete the course with an earned grade of C- or higher will also receive three college credits for 101. Students who enroll directly in a 200-level French, German, or Spanish course will receive six advanced placement credits for language courses at the 101 and 102 levels when they complete the 200-level course with a C- or higher. The advanced standing credits count on the student's record but do not count as part of the semester course load. The credits count toward fulfilling general education requirements in the area of Global Perspectives. The advanced standing credits will be awarded at no charge to the student. The Foreign Language Department awards advanced standing credit for the German, French or Spanish 201 course requirement based on student performance on CLEP tests, which are administered through the Career Services. There is a charge for the CLEP exams. Majors in French, German, or Spanish The Foreign Language Department offers majors in French, German, and Spanish that require a minimum of twenty-four credit hours of coursework on campus or the equivalent thereof with 12-18 credit hours of advanced language study in the student's major language. The advanced credits will be gained during study abroad or participation in a US-based language immersion program. Students wishing to major in French, German, or Spanish must complete all courses leading to the minor at University of Jamestown, then take additional coursework in their study abroad to complete the major. Credits gained through advanced placement or CLEP exams will be counted as coursework leading to the minor. All external upper-division courses must be approved by the Foreign Language Department prior to the student's study abroad or participation in an immersion program. Courses in the exchange institution that will meet departmental approval include but are not limited to literature of the target language, film, linguistics, grammar and composition, history, communication and media studies, business, music history, and art history. Courses must be taught in the target language in order to be approved for the major. Successful completion of required coursework while enrolled in the exchange institution is a prerequisite for fulfilling requirements for the major. Students are expected to remain in contact with their on- campus language major advisors during the course of their study abroad. Students majoring in French, German, or Spanish may participate in an ISEP-sponsored study abroad program, or they may participate in approved summer immersion or study abroad programs (program list available upon request). Students majoring in Spanish may enroll in two summers of post-minor study in the MLSA-University of Jamestown Program at the University of Costa Rica in San Jose. All ISEP participants must present a minimum GPA of 2.75 at the time of application and be accepted into a program that offers the student's major language. The department recommends that students study abroad in their junior year. For more ISEP information, students may consult the ISEP section (p. 37) of this catalog. Courses in Classical and Biblical Languages Courses in New Testament Greek (REL 301, REL 302) fulfill the Global Perspectives general education requirement. The Religion Department also offers courses in Biblical Hebrew on request. The Foreign Language Department offers beginning Latin (FLAN 300) on request. Special Topics Courses Special Topics courses are offered at the 100 (beginning) and 200 (intermediate) levels in modern foreign languages that are not part of the departmental major or minor language curricula. These currently include beginning- level courses in Portuguese and Romanian. Special Topics courses at the 300- or 400-level can be offered in Spanish, French, or German. These courses are taught in the target language and can be used by students to 106| University of Jamestown Undergraduate College Catalog replace any 300-level course for the minor or count toward the major.

Medical Laboratory Science Major Overview Medical laboratory scientists are health professionals who supervise and conduct laboratory diagnostic tests on patients' body fluids and/or tissues, assisting the physician with diagnoses and treatments. An education in this field will prepare the student for a variety of career opportunities. The Medical Laboratory Science major prepares students to transfer in three years to an MLS program outside of University of Jamestown. Acceptance into the off-campus program is independent from University of Jamestown. Students should consult with the program director, registrar, Business Office, and Financial Aid Office early in their course of study to ensure a clear understanding of the MLS program, application procedure, and financial aid implications for the off-campus portion of the course of study. (There is one prerequisite course, Hematology with lab, that must be taken online from UND or from another institution at the student's own expense.) Students must apply for admittance to an affiliated MLS program during the fall semester of the junior year. Minimum GPA is 2.8. There can be no more than one \"D\" in any math or science course, and the student must be recommended by the University of Jamestown MLS program director. The senior year is spent exclusively in professionally-oriented courses in the twelve-month clinical program; therefore, all general education requirements must be completed before attending. Grades and credits earned at the affiliated program are transferred to the University of Jamestown. Upon satisfactory completion of the program, the bachelor's degree is granted by the University of Jamestown. Two options are available in preparing for a career in medical laboratory science (MLS) Students can plan programs so that they need not decide immediately which option they will choose. Each includes a year of clinical internship in an accredited medical laboratory science (medical laboratory science) program and prepares the student for the medical laboratory scientist certification exam from the Board of Registry of the American Society of Clinical Pathologists. As a member of the Western College Alliance for Medical Laboratory Science, a Programs of Study - Majors| 121 cooperative education program between several universities and colleges in the Midwest, University of Jamestown is affiliated with the medical laboratory science program at the University of North Dakota (UND). The final professional year begins with a summer semester at the University of North Dakota. Fall and spring semesters are then spent at one of the many possible clinical sites. There are currently more than twenty-five clinical affiliates in North Dakota, Minnesota, and other western states.

Through collaboration with the University Registrar and the Nursing Department Chair, placement within the nursing program is determined and the applicant is notified. General education requirements can be met by: 1) approved transfer of previously earned college credit, 2) validation with CLEP written examinations as per university policy, 3) validation by approved departmental challenge examinations, and 4) enrollment in the courses at the University of Jamestown or another approved college/university. Course Sequence for a RN to BSN Major Nursing course cohorts begin in the summer.

Each applicant's experience and varying RN program 138| University of Jamestown Undergraduate College Catalog coursework is reviewed to determine if each nursing course is necessary and/or if partial credit may be awarded based on an experience portfolio. Some transfer students must complete certain general education courses in addition to these nursing courses. A grade of C- or higher must be earned in all nursing courses. Tuition RN to BSN Students in UJ's online BSN program pay $330 per credit hour in tuition (or $297 if they work for a UJ Business Partner). Students also pay $550 for their clinical fees, a $30 technology fee each semester, and $150 fee upon graduation to cover the costs of their diplomas, regalia, and the celebration, but will pay no other fees at UJ. Before you ever enroll at UJ, your admissions counselor and our Program Director will complete a transcript evaluation and plan of study and let you know what your degree will cost. Spanish Major Overview Mission Statement The mission of the Foreign Language Department at University of Jamestown is to help prepare the liberal arts student as a citizen of our global community. We seek to expose students to other languages and cultures, thereby broadening their concepts of language, civilization, culture, philosophy, government, religion, geography, art, aesthetics, and literature with a firm anchoring in a Christian perspective and academic excellence. In order to determine student progress toward these ends, the department assesses student learning and departmental effectiveness on a regular basis. Foreign Language Department Overview The Foreign Language Department of the University of Jamestown offers a wide range of language learning opportunities that allow students to continue to learn languages they began in high school or begin to learn new languages they first encounter at the university level. Majors are available in German, French, and Spanish to students who pursue a semester or two summers of study abroad; language minors in German, French, and Spanish can be completed on campus by students majoring in other subjects, and the interdisciplinary Italian Studies minor offers a combination of language, history, art, and study abroad to students majoring in other subjects as well. Courses in Portuguese, Romanian and Latin are also offered on demand. Placement and Advanced Standing in French, German and Spanish The first semester beginning courses in French, German, and Spanish are aimed at students with no prior instruction in those languages. A student who has completed high school course work in a foreign language is encouraged to consult with foreign language faculty members to receive advanced placement in a course beyond 101. Students who receive advanced placement into French, German, or Spanish 102 and complete the course with an earned grade of C- or higher will also receive three college credits for 101. Students who enroll directly in a 200-level French, German, or Spanish course will receive six advanced placement credits for language courses at the 101 and 102 levels when they complete the 200-level course with a C- or higher. The advanced standing credits count on the student's record but do not count as part of the semester course load. The credits count toward fulfilling general education requirements in the area of Global Perspectives. The advanced standing credits will be awarded at no charge to the student. The Foreign Language Department awards advanced standing credit for the German, French or Spanish 201 course requirement based on student performance on CLEP tests, which are administered through the Career Services. There is a charge for the CLEP exams. Majors in French, German, or Spanish The Foreign Language Department offers majors in French, German, and Spanish that require a minimum of twenty-four credit hours of coursework on campus or the equivalent thereof with 12-18 credit hours of advanced language study in the student's major language. The advanced credits will be gained during study abroad or participation in a US-based language immersion program. Students wishing to major in French, German, or Spanish must complete all courses leading to the minor at University of Jamestown, then take additional coursework in their study abroad to complete the major. Credits gained through advanced placement or CLEP exams will be counted as coursework leading to the minor. Programs of Study - Majors| 139 All external upper-division courses must be approved by the Foreign Language Department prior to the student's study abroad or participation in an immersion program. Courses in the exchange institution that will meet departmental approval include but are not limited to literature of the target language, film, linguistics, grammar and composition, history, communication and media studies, business, music history, and art history. Courses must be taught in the target language in order to be approved for the major. Successful completion of required coursework while enrolled in the exchange institution is a prerequisite for fulfilling requirements for the major. Students are expected to remain in contact with their on- campus language major advisors during the course of their study abroad. Students majoring in French, German, or Spanish may participate in an ISEP-sponsored study abroad program, or they may participate in approved summer immersion or study abroad programs (program list available upon request). Students majoring in Spanish may enroll in two summers of post-minor study in the MLSA-University of Jamestown Program at the University of Costa Rica in San Jose. All ISEP participants must present a minimum GPA of 2.75 at the time of application and be accepted into a program that offers the student's major language. The department recommends that students study abroad in their junior year. For more ISEP information, students may consult the ISEP section (p. 37) of this catalog. Courses in Classical and Biblical Languages Courses in New Testament Greek (REL 301, REL 302) fulfill the Global Perspectives general education requirement. The Religion Department also offers courses in Biblical Hebrew on request. The Foreign Language Department offers beginning Latin (FLAN 300) on request. Special Topics Courses Special Topics courses are offered at the 100 (beginning) and 200 (intermediate) levels in modern foreign languages that are not part of the departmental major or minor language curricula. These currently include beginning- level courses in Portuguese and Romanian. Special Topics courses at the 300- or 400-level can be offered in Spanish, French, or German. These courses are taught in the target language and can be used by students to replace any 300-level course for the minor or count toward the major.

The first venture of the newly established Center was to increase students' access to computers. Each room is networked for access to e-mail, the internet, and other network services. This dramatic enhancement of computer accessibility was made at no additional charge to the students. The Center's establishment was made possible with a generous lead gift from Harris and Arlyce Widmer, Fargo, ND. Mr. Widmer is a graduate of the class of 1958 and a longtime College trustee. The Center's facets include the following: Studies in Information Technology (See Computer Science (p. 82) section) Software skills certification , which involves training in word processing, spread sheets, databases, e-mail and Internet, web page design, presentation software, graphics, desktop publishing, and networking. Special internship opportunities , which will greatly enhance the resum\u00e9 of University of Jamestown graduates. Honors Program Overview The mission of the University of Jamestown Honors program is to challenge students to explore and integrate ideas from multiple disciplines, and to think critically and creatively. Admission to Program Incoming freshmen who have earned a 3.0 or higher high school GPA are encouraged to apply to join the Honors Program. Current UJ students and transfer students with a 3.2 or higher post-secondary GPA are also encouraged to apply to join the Honors Program. We will admit as many applicants as we can accommodate. Applications will be reviewed based on GPA and student response to two application questions. Requirements Required Courses HNRS 110 Disrupting Education 1 HNRS 401 Honors Capstone I 1 HNRS 402 Honors Capstone II 1 7 Honors Seminars 7 or 4 Honor Seminars plus 3- credit Honors Contract course 7 7 Honors Seminars: 1 credit each. Students must have earned a 3.2 or higher cumulative UJ GPA to complete the Honors Program and graduate with University Honors. Pre-Professional Preparation Pre-Engineering The 3-2 engineering program provides a three-year course of study at the University of Jamestown with an additional two years of study in one of many engineering programs at universities around the country. Students completing the program receive two degrees: a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics from the University of Jamestown and a Bachelor of Science in engineering from the university at which they complete their engineering courses. Recent University of Jamestown engineering students have completed their studies at several universities, including: *Montana Tech (College of Mineral Science and Technology) *North Dakota State University *South Dakota School of Mines *University of North Dakota *University of South Dakota *Washington University, St. Louis, Mo. Pre-Medicine The University of Jamestown offers pre-professional preparation for a number of health-related fields such as medicine, dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatry, osteopathy, chiropractic, physical therapy, and occupational therapy. Traditionally, more than 85 percent of our science (biology and chemistry) majors pursue further study or professional degrees in the health Other Academic Programs Other Academic Programs| 153 professions, graduate research, and/or teaching. Note: Students preparing for health profession programs should obtain scheduling advice from advisors in biology or chemistry before registering for classes. Pre-Medicine Most American medical colleges select for admission only those applicants with a four-year college degree and prefer students with a well-rounded liberal arts education. Admission to medical school is strongly influenced by two measures: the student's score on the nationally administered Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) and the overall grade point average (GPA). University of Jamestown students historically have received excellent preparation for successful performance on the MCAT. We believe the key to this success is the availability of our instructors to help students. Students' scholastic achievements and their successful attainment of career goals are important to us. Pre-medicine students are not limited to a single set of courses. Students plan their programs in consultation with the pre-medical advisors. Medical schools usually require only a few basic courses. Beyond this minimum, courses may be chosen according to the student's own interests. The majority of the University of Jamestown pre-medical students choose to major in either biology, chemistry, or biochemistry; but a major in a different area may be satisfactory. It should be noted, however, that the first two years of medical school consist of intensive coursework in biology and chemistry. Pre-Chiropractic, Pre-Dentistry, Pre-Optometry, Pre- Osteopathy, Pre-Podiatry, Pre-Veterinary Collegiate preparation for admission to schools of dentistry, optometry, veterinary, and other health professions is essentially the same as that for medical school. United States dental schools require that applicants take the Dental Admission Test (DAT) and schools of optometry require the Optometry Admission Test (OAT). Students interested in these fields should contact advisors in biology or chemistry to prepare a course program to meet their individual objectives. Also, professional schools may differ in what courses they desire applicants to have taken. Pre-Pharmacy The University of Jamestown traditionally has provided a strong background for students pursuing a degree in pharmacy. The Student Success Center and health professions advisors should be consulted when planning a pre-pharmacy schedule.

Students may complete two or three years of coursework at the University of Jamestown and apply for the professional 154| University of Jamestown Undergraduate College Catalog programs at other institutions. Alternatively, students may complete four years of training in a major at University of Jamestown and then apply for Master of Science programs. As with other professional programs, admission to occupational therapy at the graduate level is competitive. Students considering this program should consult the Student Success Center and health professions advisors in biology or chemistry when planning their coursework.
