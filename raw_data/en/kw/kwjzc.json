False vaccination certificates issued by medical doctors to serve for [children](/c/1/pregnancy-childbirth-children)'s enrollment in kindergarden or school, are not rarery spoken of. [Children](/c/1/pregnancy-childbirth-children) who are just waiting to reach adulthood to stand up to their parents and get vaccinated. These people began to associate with extreme vegetarians who protested for animal rights in the form of packaged frozen meat. They say they are conservationists. A distinction between between an ecologist and an environmentalist, or a homeopath, herbalist [ and nutritionist, becomes more and more vague and inintelligable for the general public](/p/koi_9_bilki_pomaghat_pri_kashlitsa_88c1e5ad_66c2_4b76_a42b_ca71d9d16c71) In this article, we will observe neutrality by explaining what [alternative medicine](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine) is and point out all its 22 subtypes, referring to the classification of the National Medical Library of the United [States - MESH (Medical Subject Headings)](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000529) [ref. 1]. We will consider its benefits, for whom this type of [treatment](/k/1/treatment?s=off) is appropriate and who should avoid it. What is [alternative medicine](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine) By definition, [alternative medicine](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine) is a set of therapeutic practices that are not currently part of the generally accepted allopathic medical practice. Two types are considered: - When the alternative type of therapy is used in conjunction with classical (conventional medicine), it is called complementary (complementary) medicine. - When the alternative type of practice is used instead of generally accepted medicine, it is called [Alternative Medicine](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine). Some units of [alternative medicine](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine) often lack sufficient scientific evidence, but since they have been applied for centuries, they are well studied in practice (e.g. curative [diet](/c/1/diets-and-nutrition-plans), [acupuncture](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine)). Other parts of it are not so prevalent (Dry Needling e.g.) and there is a tendency for these types of therapies to disappear and leave only a historical footprint. What types of [alternative medicine](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine) exist Some sources count down to 400-420 [ types of alternative practices, but officially according to the Classification of the National Medical Library, there are 22 basic subtypes of ](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000529) [alternative medicine](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine). punctura \"pricking\", is a technique for treating [disease](/c/1/diseases-conditions-and-symptoms) by placing needles on certain, according to the [disease](/c/1/diseases-conditions-and-symptoms), [acupuncture](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine) points on the body.

[Homeopathy](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine) - the founder was Samuel Hahnemann in 1796, and the concept is to treat [diseases](/c/1/diseases-conditions-and-symptoms) with the highly diluted form of the substance causing the [disease](/c/1/diseases-conditions-and-symptoms) in question. 9.

Spiritual therapy - includes a mix of mystical, religious, spiritual practices for [healing](/k/1/treatment?s=off) purposes. What are the benefits of [alternative medicine](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine) \"What are the benefits of [alternative medicine](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine)?\" is a difficult question that cannot be answered unambiguously, with a variety of methods. From a historical pointof view , until a very late stage of the scientificdevelopment of mankind, it was not possible to develop classical medicine as we know it today. Prehistoric medicine used [herbs](/k/1/herbs?s=off), potions, spiritual practices and rituals led by priests and shamans, which is quite natural.The [ translation of the papyrus can be found HERE and you can look at a case for the diagnosis and ](http://www.touregypt.net/edwinsmithsurgical.htm) [treatment](/k/1/treatment?s=off) of the [ sick. until [ref. 2] is strengthened.](/p/oshchie_7_ghrupi_zaboliavaniia_koito_miedt_liekuva_6b2f7c31_1862_4ec9_a361_a9e7fb4094e1) Over the years, science has begun to \"check\" alternative [treatment](/k/1/treatment?s=off) practices to explain exactly how they work. For whom is [alternative medicine](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine) [treatment](/k/1/treatment?s=off) appropriate In many cases, people are resorting to alternative [treatments](/k/1/treatment?s=off) where classical medicine can no longer help and use unconfirmed or hesitant science-denied practices.It gives hope. Whether [treatment](/k/1/treatment?s=off) is appropriate - sometimes it becomes a matter of personal choice. In fact, [alternative medicine](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine) refers to a centuries-old \"sample error\" and if the medical practice is proven not to be harmful, It is quietly used, even if its positive result is not sure. For whom is [alternative medicine](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine) [treatment](/k/1/treatment?s=off) contraindicated Given that there are 22 types of categories and about 400 types of practices, it is not possible to say who alternative [treatment](/k/1/treatment?s=off) is contraindicated for. This is an issue that depends on the type of therapy and on very many individual factors . Patients trust the doctor whotrusts them. In India, people do not trust classical medicine and would prefer a healer in the spiritual sense of the word than to be treated by a doctor in a clinic. In China, healers pass on the knowledge of Traditional Chinese Medicine generation to generation, from teacher to apprentice, for centuries and there, too, classical medicine is not so imposed. With us in Bulgaria it is only natural not to trust people who practice [acupuncture](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine) or Indian [healing](/k/1/treatment?s=off) practices after only 2-3 years of training. Finally, when we wonder whether to turn to [alternative medicine](/c/1/traditional-and-alternative-medicine), let us know thatclassical aims to be the most humane type of [treatment](/k/1/treatment?s=off) at the [heart](/k/1/heart?s=off) of which is the Hippocratic Oath with \"Primum non [ref. 3].
