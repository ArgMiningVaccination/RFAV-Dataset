Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center understands the need to support survivors with uniquely tailored follow-up care. Recently developed by our Endocrine Tumor Program, a new survivorship clinic provides long-term follow-up care for patients with thyroid cancer. It also serves those with other cancer-related endocrine problems. \"We've always followed patients long term,\" said endocrinologist [Mara Roth, MD](/en/provider-directory/mara-y-roth.html). \"But having a dedicated clinic elevates these services and improves patients' access to care. [Katherine Parikh, ARNP](/en/provider-directory/katherine-parikh.html) leads the clinic in collaboration with Endocrine Tumor Program physicians. \"Having regular follow-up visits and a resource for questions or concerns often gives patients peace of mind,\" said Parikh. \"Studies show that survivorship care also improves patient outcomes.\" The Endocrine Tumor Program survivorship clinic provides longitudinal care for a range of endocrine-related conditions, including: \"The care we provide varies from person to person depending on their condition and cancer history,\" said Parikh. \"We develop a customized plan for each patient that addresses their individual needs.\" Parikh is part of a team of endocrine tumor experts. This team includes endocrinologists, medical oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, radiation oncologists, molecular imaging and therapy specialists and pathologists. \"I work closely with the physicians, especially when developing care plans for complex or unusual cases,\" said Parikh. \"We also discuss challenging cases at our monthly tumor board meetings, which include the entire team. This collaboration helps ensure the best treatment plan for each patient.\" Patients' needs change after cancer treatment, and often require long-term attention.
