Mycoplasma genitalium (M. genitalium) is transmitted sexually. In men M. genitalium infection causes urethritis (infection of the urethra, the urinary canal leading from the bladder to exit at the tip of the penis). Symptoms may include: In women M. genitalium infection causes infection of the cervix (opening of the uterus (womb) at the top of the vagina). Symptoms are usually absent but may include: Without adequate treatment, infection of the cervix may spread to the Fallopian tubes (tubes leading from the ovary to the uterus) and cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). This may be without symptoms, but there may be: If untreated, PID may lead to scarring of the Fallopian tubes and ectopic or tubal pregnancy (in the Fallopian tubes) or eventual infertility. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test in a pathology laboratory on urine or a sample of discharge from the cervix or urethra. However, a PCR test for M. genitalium is not readily available and many infections in men will be labelled as [non-specific urethritis](/wps/wcm/connect/public+content/sa+health+internet/conditions/infectious+diseases/non-specific+urethritis+nsu/non-specific+urethritis+nsu+-+including+symptoms+treatment+and+prevention). The diagnosis is usually made when symptoms are present and tests for [gonorrhoea](/wps/wcm/connect/public+content/sa+health+internet/conditions/infectious+diseases/gonorrhoea/gonorrhoea+-+including+symptoms+treatment+and+prevention) and [chlamydia](/wps/wcm/connect/public+content/sa+health+internet/conditions/infectious+diseases/chlamydia+genital/chlamydia+genital+-+including+symptoms+treatment+and+prevention) are negative and further testing for M. genitalium is undertaken. (time between becoming infected and developing symptoms) Variable, usually 2 to 35 days. (time during which an infected person can infect others) Until appropriate antibiotic treatment has been completed. Effective antibiotic treatment is available on prescription from a doctor. Continued or recurring symptoms may require referral for specialist treatment. "}
