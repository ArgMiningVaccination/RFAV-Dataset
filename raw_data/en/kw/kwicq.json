Sugars and refined carbs provide a quick boost, while grains, legumes, and whole foods provide more sustainable energy that will keep the body going longer. The list we give here focuses on foods and drinks that provide more stable energy throughout the day. The following fruits may help boost energy: 1. Bananas [Bananas](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/271157.php) may be the best quick snack for sustained energy. While bananas are a good natural source of sugar, they are also rich in fibers that help slow the digestion of that sugar. Bananas contain helpful nutrients that make the body feel full of energy. A study in the journal [PLoS One](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3355124/) [carbohydrate](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/161547.php) drink. While most people are not cycling each day, bananas may still provide energy. 2. Avocados Avocados are a well-rounded fruit in terms of health values and nutrients. As a study in [Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3664913/) They also contain good fats that may increase energy levels, and make fat-soluble nutrients more available in the body. 3. Goji Berries Goji berries are small, reddish berries containing many nutrients and important anti-aging and [antioxidant](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/301506.php) properties, as a review in [Drug Design, Development and Therapy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4277126/) Dried goji berries make a great addition to a trail mix, and many people add a few to a water bottle to drink throughout the day. 4. Apples Apples may be another simple snack to give the body lasting energy. Along with fiber and nutrients, a study in the journal [Horticulture Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6186759/) [stress](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/145855.php) and [inflammation](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248423.php) in the body. 5. Strawberries As a study in the [Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24450925) [vitamin](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/195878.php) C, and folates. They also contain phenols, which are essential antioxidants that may help the body create energy at the cellular level. People can add strawberries to many dishes, and a handful may also be an easy snack to add to a diet. 6. Oranges Most people enjoy oranges for their taste, which comes from the antioxidant vitamin C. Vitamin C may help reduce oxidative stress in the body and prevent [fatigue](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248002.php). A study in the journal [Antioxidants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6071228/) [depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/kc/depression-causes-symptoms-treatments-8933). 7. Dark berries Berries, including [blueberries](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/287710.php), raspberries, and blackberries, may be a good energy boosting food when the body is craving something sweet. Dark berries tend to be higher in natural antioxidants than lighter-colored ones, which may reduce inflammation and fatigue in the body. They also tend to have less sugar than sweeter fruits, while still satisfying a craving for a sweet taste. The following animal products may help boost energy: 8. Fatty fish Fish, in general, is an excellent and light source of protein and B vitamins that may give the body sustained energy throughout the day. Fatty cold-water fish, such as salmon, sardines, and tuna, tend to be higher in [omega-3](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/40253.php) fatty acids. As a study in the journal [Nutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4210907/) 9. Beef liver Beef liver may be one of the best meat sources for vitamin B-12, which keeps the body feeling full of energy. While many cuts of meat contain vitamin B-12, the difference is that beef liver has a large amount. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), a 3-ounce cut of beef flank steak contains about [1.5 micrograms (mcg)](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3756?fg=&manu=&lfacet=&format=Full&count=&max=25&offset=975&sort=ndb&qlookup=beef) The same cut of beef liver contains [60 mcg](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/13326) 10. Yogurt Yogurt may also be a [source of energy](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/01116?fgcd=&manu=&format=&count=&max=25&offset=&sort=default=asc&qlookup=yogurt&ds=&qt=&qp=&qa=&qn=&q=&ing=) Yogurt is also very easy to eat on the go, which makes it a great alternative to vending machine food. 11. Eggs Eggs provide the body with plenty of protein and nutrients for sustainable energy. As the USDA note, one large hard-boiled egg contains about [6 grams (g)](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/01129?fgcd=Dairy+and+Egg+Products&manu=&format=&count=&max=25&offset=&sort=default=asc&qlookup=Egg%2C+whole%2C+cooked%2C+hard-boiled&ds=&qt=&qp=&qa=&qn=&q=&ing=) [5 g of fat](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/01129?fgcd=Dairy+and+Egg+Products&manu=&format=&count=&max=25&offset=&sort=default=asc&qlookup=Egg%2C+whole%2C+cooked%2C+hard-boiled&ds=&qt=&qp=&qa=&qn=&q=&ing=) The following vegetables are good options for energy: 12. Yams and sweet potatoes Yams and sweet potatoes are beneficial sources of carbohydrates, which provide energy. Yet sweet potatoes are also high in fiber, which may help slow the body's absorption of these carbohydrates. This may make them a good option for sustained energy throughout the day. 13. Beets As a study in the journal [Food Science and Biotechnology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6049374/) 14. Dark leafy greens Dark, leafy greens such as [kale](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270435.php), spinach, and collard greens are nutrient dense and contain filling proteins, as well as nutrients and antioxidants. Greens may be difficult to digest raw for some people, so breaking them down by cooking them with a bit of vinegar or lemon juice may help. 15. Dark chocolate Dark chocolate may be an easy way to increase energy. Rich, dark chocolate usually has much less sugar than milk chocolate. Less sugar means less immediate energy, but more cocoa content means more of the benefits of cocoa, including helpful antioxidants such as flavonoids. A study in the journal [Archives of the Turkish Society of Cardiology](https://www.journalagent.com/tkd/pdfs/TKDA_43_2_199_207.pdf) notes that dark chocolate may benefit the cardiovascular system by helping more blood pump around the body. This blood carries fresh oxygen, which may also make a person feel more awake and alert. The following grains may help with energy: 16. Oatmeal A bowl of whole-grain oatmeal may be a great way to provide the body with energy. Oats are rich in fiber, and they may enable the body to feel fuller for longer than other breakfast choices. As a study in [The Journal of Nutrition](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/145/2/222/4585693) 17. Popcorn Popcorn is rich in carbohydrates. However, it also contains fiber to help slow the digestion. Popcorn may make a person feel full for longer than other carbohydrates. As a study in [Nutrition Journal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3502142/) [calories](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/245588.php) than potato chips. 18. Quinoa [Quinoa](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/274745.php) is a seed, but most people treat it as a grain. Quinoa is high in protein, carbohydrates, and fiber. The combination of amino acids and slow-release carbohydrates may make for sustainable energy rather than a short burst of glucose from other grains. 19. Brown rice One of the benefits of brown rice may be that it retains much of the fiber from the husk. The husk is not there in white rice, which may cause the body to absorb the carbohydrate content quickly. This may lead to a spike and then a crash in energy levels. By having the husk, brown rice may help slow the digestion of these carbohydrates, therefore, releasing energy more slowly. The following beans and legumes may help with energy: 20. Soybeans Whether roasted soybeans or young [edamame](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/280285.php) beans in the pod, [soybeans](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/11212?fgcd=&manu=&format=&count=&max=25&offset=&sort=default=asc&qlookup=WHOLE+EDAMAME%2C+UPC%3A+038259114506&ds=&qt=&qp=&qa=&qn=&q=&ing=) [magnesium](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/286839.php) and [potassium](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/287212.php), according to the USDA. 21. Lentils Lentils are a relatively cheap form of protein and fiber, which may make them a great option for people on a budget. The USDA note that [1 cup of lentils](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/16070?fgcd=&manu=&format=&count=&max=25&offset=&sort=default=asc&qlookup=Lentils%2C+mature+seeds%2C+cooked%2C+boiled%2C+without+salt&ds=&qt=&qp=&qa=&qn=&q=&ing=) The fiber may help to manage the digestion of the carbs, keeping the body full and providing a source of sustained energy. 22. Nuts Many nuts contain a blend of protein, fats, and some carbohydrates to provide energy throughout the day. Nuts are typically also rich sources of vitamins and minerals such as magnesium, [calcium](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248958.php), or phosphorous. Nuts are usually high in essential fatty acids. As a study in the [Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26177664) Nuts are high in calories, as well, so people should be careful not to eat too many 23. Peanut butter Peanut butter is typically rich in protein, fats, and fiber, and may help a person feel full for longer after eating it. This may cut the need for constant snacking, which may also leave a person feeling drained as their body has to digest continuously. 24. Seeds Many seeds, such as [pumpkin](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/279610.php) seeds, chia seeds, and flax seeds, are rich sources of fatty acids and fiber, which may translate to more energy. Seeds are also easy to carry and make a great addition to a quick trail mix. The following drinks can help boost energy: 25. Water Water is the most crucial energizing ingredient on this list. Water is vital for every cell in the body to work correctly. While most people think of [dehydration](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/153363.php) as an extreme scenario, the body may become partially dehydrated if a person goes all morning without water. Maintaining energy can be as simple as carrying a water bottle around and sipping it throughout the day to stay properly hydrated. 26. Coffee [Coffee](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/270202.php) is a recognizable energy booster. The caffeine in coffee makes the body and mind feel alert and may make people more productive. Coffee also contains antioxidants called polyphenols, which may reduce oxidative stress in the cells and help the body function better. Coffee is a stimulant, however, so people should consume it in moderation. Too much coffee may lead to energy loss as the body withdraws from the caffeine. 27. Green tea [Green tea](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/269538.php) still contains small amounts of caffeine, but it also has compounds that may help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in the body. The result may be a smoother transition than coffee to a more awake and energetic state. 28. Yerba mat\u00e9 Yerba mat\u00e9 is a drink native to South America. Drinking the herb as a tea provides the body with similar stimulating effects as tea or coffee. Yerba mat\u00e9 contains many active nutrients, antioxidants, and amino acids. People who drink yerba mat\u00e9 say it provides a much smoother form of energy by comparison to the jolt of energy from coffee. As a study in the journal [Nutrients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5579675/) While most foods provide energy, the ones above focus on sustained energy. Foods to try to avoid may include: - fast foods or fried foods - added sugars - packaged snacks and candy bars - baked sweets such as cakes and cupcakes While this list is not exhaustive, the idea behind finding energy boosting foods is to consume a varied, balanced diet. Vitamins, fiber, fats, and proteins are all essential for energy, but it is crucial to find a balance between them. People should try to choose a varied diet containing many different, nutritious foods that give the body sustained energy. "}
