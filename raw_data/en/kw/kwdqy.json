Doctor's OfficeConvenience Care ClinicUrgent Care Center Emergency Room (ER)WHEN TO GOYour doctor's office usually is the best choice for preventive exams or treatment for a current health issue. Your doctor knows you best and has your medical records. Your doctor can also help you manage your medications and refer you to a specialist if you need more care.You can't get to your doctor's office, but your condition is not urgent or an emergency. Convenience care clinics, often located in malls or retail stores, offer services for minor health conditions. Care is normally provided by nurse practitioners or physician assistants.You may need care quickly, but it is not an emergency, and your regular doctor may not be available. Urgent care centers offer treatment for non-life-threatening injuries or illnesses and are staffed by qualified physicians.You need immediate treatment of a very serious or critical condition. The ER is for the treatment of life-threatening or very serious conditions that require immediate medical attention. Do not ignore an emergency. If a situation seems life-threatening, take action.
