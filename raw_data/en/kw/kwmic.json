This course plays an essential role in the treatment process since the condition of patients need to be analysed by the biomedical expertise, to customize effective medical treatment for them. Consequently, students have to authenticate the cause of disease assisted by medical equipment after collecting patients' tears, tissues, blood, faces and urine samples. Students will also use computers, microscopes and other high-tech laboratories facilities. In addition, students ought to take part in the research projects such as the terminal diseases and mutation of cells. Study Subjects Advanced Pharmacology, Applications of Bioinformatics, Applied Nutrition, Basic Anatomy with Histology and Hematology, Basic Pharmacology and Toxicology with Health Informatics, Clinical Chemistry, Clinical Genetics, Community Nutrition, Epidemiology and Public Health, Human Pathology, Human Physiology, Immunology, Instrumentation in Medical Diagnostic, Laboratory Science and Blood Banking, Medical Microbiology, Medical Parasitology, Microbiology, Nutritional Biochemistry, Principles of Biochemistry Career Opportunities Graduates can carry out pharmaceutical inspection and research in laboratories, medical centres, the government of private hospitals. Students can also choose to work as medical products consultant or salesman, laboratory administrator or a consultant of patients in an insurance company. It is worth noticing that a graduate in biomedical science is not a doctor, which is not allowed to carry out surgery or provide medication. Introduction Dentistry is a branch of medical studies which focuses on the health of teeth, oral hard tissue and the oral soft tissues. Students in dentistry will not only learn the procedures of oral checkups but also study restorations, scaling and extraction for teeth. Furthermore, students will be exposed to some of the technologies that are integrated with the beauty industry for examples, implantation, orthodontics and tooth bleaching. In this profession, most of the dentist chose general outpatient care, but some dentists will continue pursuing their studies to specialization. The specialization in dentistry includes Study Subjects Biochemistry, Dental anatomy and histology, Dental materials, Endodontics, General medicine, General physiology, General surgery, Histology, Human anatomy, Microbiology, Oral maxillofacial surgery, Oral medicine and radiology, Oral Pathology, Orthodontics, Pedodontics, Periodontics, Pharmacology, Pre-clinical conservative dentistry, Prosthodontics, Public health dentistry Career Opportunities The graduates need to register with the Malaysian Dental Council to work in government hospitals for three years, then is given choice to continue serving in the hospitals or change to private hospitals. Other than that, graduates may establish their dentist or work in dental care company, for examples, Oral B and Colgate to work as a consultant. Introduction Diagnostic radiography and radiation therapy focus on cultivating medical personnel major in diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy. These two disciplinary is different from each other and the only University of Malaya put them together among the public universities in our country. Diagnostic radiography deals with the medical equipment, for instance, X-Ray machine, computed tomography scan, ultrasound, angiography, MRI - Agnetic resonance imaging and radionuclide to obtain human body data, especially the tissues that we could not see by narrow eyes, such as bones and organs for diagnosis of diseases. Meanwhile, radiation therapy makes use of radiation, X-Ray, Gamma-ray and electron beam to treat a cancer patient. Therefore, this disciplinary does not involve the operations of medical instruments, what they learnt is all about scientific radiotherapy with ionization and non-ionization to diagnose and treat the patients. Study Subjects Anatomy & Physiology, Basic Pathology, Behavioral Science Systemic Pathology, Biostatistics and Research Methodology, Brachytherapy, Computing and Medical Informatics, Conventional Imaging Process, Digital Imaging Process, General Pharmacology, General Physics, Healthcare Management, Human Radiation Biology, ICT Application, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Oncology, Professional Ethics and Patient Care, Radiation Physics, Radiation Safety, Radiographic Anatomy and Critique, Radiographic Instrumentation, Radiographic Tech, Radionuclide Imaging, Radiotherapy Treatment Planning, Sectional Anatomy, Ultrasound Career Opportunities Graduates may work as a radiographer or radiotherapist in the government or private hospitals. Besides, students may engage in the research and development of medical equipment and radiotherapy in laboratories or research institutions. Introduction Environmental and occupational health deals with the impact of environmental change on human health. Other than the environmental factor, students also study about the influence of the workplace towards an individual. For instance, the machinery noise hazard, employee safety measures, hygiene level and the production process may endanger employees' physiology and psychology health. Furthermore, students also learn to operate measuring instruments and devices to identify the safety of the workplace, for example, noise level measurement, accidents and risk assessment, water quality safety and the mining engineering safety. The learning scope of students also enlarged to the prevention, control and improvement of the environmental adverse effects on people. Study Subjects Anatomy and Physiology, Behavioral Science, Biochemistry for Environmental Health, Built Environment, Housing & Technology, Chemistry for Environmental Health, Diseases Related to Env. & Occupational Health, Environmental & Occ. Emergency Response Management, Environmental & Occ.

Students can also consider devoting to the industrial and construction industry to serve as an environmental science consultant to take charge of the employee safety, safety control, waste treatment and environmental assessment. Introduction Medicine is a department that cultivates professional doctors to meet the medical and health needs of society. Engaged in the profession of doctors must have high pressure resistance, sense of responsibility and love, because doctors have a great responsibility, and the health and life of patients are in their hands. In addition, this department requires a lot of learning, and students who choose this department must be fully psychologically prepared to face heavy academic pressure. There are two types of degrees generally taken by medical students, namely MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine & Bachelor of Surgery) and MD (Doctor of Medicine). The above two degrees have equal academic qualifications, the difference is that MBBS is a degree from the United Kingdom and MD is a degree from the United States. Medicine is based on treatment, research and prevention of diseases as the main research principles. It can be divided into three categories: It classified by medical speciality, it can be generally divided into: However, internal medicine and surgery have different areas of specialization: Majors in internal medicine are: Majors in surgery include: Study Subjects Theory teaching stage: Biochemistry, Physiology, Anatomy, Radiology, Pathology, Microbiology, Pharmacology, Parasitology, Anesthesiology Clinical teaching stage: Bed learning, Patrolling wards, Contacting patients with experienced doctors in the ward, Diagnosing the condition, Internal medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and gynaecology, Anesthesiology Career Opportunities Graduates must first apply for temporary registration with the Malaysian Medical Council. After two years of internship, they will be officially recognized as a qualified doctor by the Malaysia Medical Council (MMC). After that, they have to serve in government hospitals for three years. In addition, all graduates who are interested in continuing their studies can also choose to study in a speciality to become a specialist or specialize in a master's degree or doctorate to teach at a university.
