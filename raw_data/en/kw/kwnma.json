History of Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) dates back to ancient China, where TCM practitioners used traditional herbal medicine in treating different kinds of diseases. The entire setup of Chinese medication is mainly based on systematic theories as well as abundant preventive and therapeutic methods, which deal with various health problems. Traditional Chinese medicine is mainly dependent on the Chinese culture, Chinese knowledge about various plants, trees, substances, and herbs used. The Chinese culture, like any other Asian culture, is based on a particular philosophy. Moreover, the Chinese way of life has become part of TCM. The Famous Five Phases As the Chinese were studying the things around them, they discovered major connections in nature and man's internal organ system. Through such observations, early TCM practitioners developed a health care system that involved human body organs and natural elements. Hence, they came up with the theory called the Five Phases Theory. The five elements include wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. These elements represent the energies, which are involved in the continuous cycle of life and death. It has ultimately defined a correlation between the parts of the human body, nature, and society. Life events resemble a circle, which they call as the creation cycle, where: - Wood - is burned in fire - Fire - produces ashes to earth - Earth - gives ore to produce metal - Metal - causes condensation to produce water - Water - sustains plants and trees to grow wood In TCM, each particular element is related to specific internal body organs: yin and yang organs. An example of a yin organ is the liver, which is dense and solid. Its counterpart, yang, would be the gallbladder, which is a hollow and pocket-like organ. The theory is quite simple to understand\u2014the elements and body organs flow together endlessly in one loop. TCM is firmly based on the proper interaction of the organ systems, which greatly influence how the body functions as a whole. The various health benefits that TCM offers have been included in Eastern practices. It helps in minimizing stress and strain along with natural pain management. It offers a better way of life, restful sleep, strong immunity, and a reduced need for medications. The Chinese health care system originated in 200 B.C. and it remains stronger even after thousands of years. TCM is the most natural way of restorative healing, which is based on the holistic approach and self-healing mechanism. According to TCM, the entire body is a form of a complicated network, which has been interconnected to many of its parts and with many interrelated links.

Ancient Chinese Philosophy TCM is considered as one of the most commonly used ancient medical practices in the US since the 1970s. Chinese medications have a higher impact in Eastern practices. There are many Asian medicinal practices, which have been successful in the Western part of the world. Some of the Asian practices include yoga, meditation, tai chi, and acupuncture. These practices help in providing better and quality healthcare systems. Most of the practices offered are mainly based on culture, traditions, and science, which were preserved by the people over thousands of years. The traditional healing approach of China has always helped mankind in overcoming health-related issues of everyday life. There are many other practices that are highly popular and very useful, but the traditional Chinese medicine stands out and has been respected all over the world. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been preserved for thousands of years by the Chinese. TCM became popular in the Western world, especially in America, during the early 70s. According to the Chinese philosophy, Chinese medicine is based on the belief of vital energy called \"qi\" (pronounced as \"chee\"), which is the essential part of life and health. The principles of qi are quite famous and are based on various systems and pathways, which are constantly used in developing and utilizing Chinese traditional medicine. It is always useful in keeping the medicinal system intact and under complete balance. Meridians are part of TCM practices and are completely based on the theories of acupuncture and acupressure. Specific meridians mainly focus on different points of the body such as the hands, feet, fingers, and toes. Restoring your qi can help in preventing both major and minor diseases, helps you develop a stronger immune system, and fights against different types of infections, disorders, and inflammation, including various injuries and body pain. Another concept that is vital to traditional Chinese medicine is yin and yang, which is defined as opposing, but complementary energies. You might be familiar with the yin-yang symbol (a circle that is half white and half black with smaller circles inside). It is used to represent the concept of all of the earth's opposing forces, including hot and cold, winter and summer, as well as energy and rest. Just like qi, yin and yang can negatively affect your health when they are out of balance and one is more dominant than the other. Thus, the primary goal of TCM treatment is to restore such equalizing relationship. What are the advantages of TCM?
