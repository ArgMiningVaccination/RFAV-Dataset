Influenza A viruses that have many different hosts including humans, birds, and pigs are divided into subtypes based on hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins on the surface of the virus. At present, 18 different HA (H1-H18) and 11 different NA (N1-N11) molecules are known to exist ( [2](#B2)). [3](#B3) [4](#B4)). The 23-amino acid sequence in the extracellular domain of M2 (M2e) is well conserved among human influenza A viruses although there are few residue changes among non-human host species such as avian and swine influenza A viruses ( [5](#B5) [6](#B6) [7](#B7)). Especially, the MSLLTEVET sequence (aa 1-9) in M2e was found to be conserved at a rate of over 99% among all influenza A viruses ( [5](#B5) [8](#B8)) because these residues are shared with those of M1. Therefore, M2e-based vaccines may be developed into attractive candidates for a universal influenza vaccine with a broad spectrum of prevention. [9](#B9) [10](#B10)). Therefore, previous studies have focused on increasing the immunogenicity of M2e using a variety of carrier vehicles or in combination with various adjuvants. Examples of carrier vehicles for M2e antigens include hepatitis B virus core particles that were reported with M2e antigens or incomplete Also, recombinant live vectors expressing M2e antigens that were tested in animal models are to utilize adenovirus ( [16](#B16)) or modified vaccinia virus Ankara ( [27](#B27)). Most studies described above reported that M2e-based vaccines even with potent experimental adjuvants can provide survival protection but are not capable of completely preventing weight loss after lethal challenge with different strains of influenza A virus. Thus, studies on the protective efficacies by M2e-based vaccination, involving a certain degree of body weight loss, suggest that M2e immunity-mediated cross protection is relatively weak. Despite extensive reports with M2e-based vaccines, the mechanism studies of cross protection by the immune responses induced by M2e vaccination have been relatively rare. Most licensed human vaccines are based on the induction of neutralizing antibodies. However, M2e immunity confers protection through non-neutralizing immune mechanisms. In this article, we have reviewed the possible immune mechanisms of M2e-mediated protection. M2e ANTIBODIES AND ANTIGENIC BINDING PROPERTIES [28](#B28)). Immunization with whole-inactivated or split influenza vaccine in mice was not effective in inducing M2e-specific antibodies ( [10](#B10) [22](#B22) [28](#B28) [29](#B29) [30](#B30)), probably because shielding effects by HA and NA proteins might prevent the access of M2e to immune effector cells. In contrast, the M2 protein is expressed at high levels on the plasma membrane surfaces of virus-infected cells ( [31](#B31) [32](#B32)). Mouse anti-M2e monoclonal antibody 14C2 has been reported to reduce plaque sizes of some influenza A virus strains in vitro but not other strains (A/PR/8/34, A/WSN/34) ( [32](#B32)). Moreover, passive immunotherapy with 14C2 monoclonal antibody reduced human influenza virus replication in the lung of mice ( [33](#B33)). [9](#B9) [34](#B34) [35](#B35)). M2e vaccine immune sera were shown to be reactive to M2 proteins expressed on the surfaces of infected cells ( [34](#B34) [35](#B35)). In general, M2 immunity provides weak protective efficacy, which might be due to the fact that anti-M2e antibodies cannot neutralize the virus in vitro ( [33](#B33) [35](#B35) [36](#B36)). IMPROVED CROSS PROTECTION BY HETEROLOGOUS M2e DOMAINS PRESENTED ON VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES [5](#B5)). In a strategy to overcome these M2e sequence variations, a heterologous tandem repeat of M2e epitope sequences (M2e5x) of human, swine, and avian origin influenza A viruses was expressed in a membrane-anchored form and incorporated into as probed by M2e specific monoclonal antibody was detected at hundreds fold higher than those in influenza virions and wild type M2 on VLPs ( [9](#B9) [10](#B10)). Recombinant M2e5x VLP vaccine has several unique features using genetic engineering techniques, which are different from other M2e vaccines. (i) The M2e5x protein contains heterologous M2e sequences with a linear tandem array of conserved M2e sequences derived from human, swine, and avian host origin influenza A viruses for broader coverages. (ii) The oligomerization domain of general control nondepressible 4 (GCN4) to stabilize oligomer formation was genetically fused to the C-terminal part of M2e5x. (iii) The signal peptide from the honeybee protein melittin was added to the N-terminus of M2e5x, which is known for efficient expression on insect cell surfaces ( [37](#B37)). (iv) Finally, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail domains were replaced with those derived from HA to take advantage of its high levels on influenza virus, expecting for efficient incorporation into VLPs. [9](#B9) [10](#B10)). Compared to mono M2e or homologous tandem M2e vaccines, M2e5x VLP vaccine was demonstrated to be highly efficacious in conferring cross protection against H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 subtype viruses by 100% protection with preventing severe weight loss in the absence of exogenous adjuvants ( [9](#B9) [10](#B10)). In addition, immune sera were found to be sufficient for conferring cross protection against H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 influenza virues in na\u00efve mice ( [9](#B9) [10](#B10)). It is significant to provide strong evidence that M2e-specific antibodies can have cross protective roles although these M2e antibodies lack in vitro virus neutralizing activity. However, it is difficult to compare the efficacy of different M2e-based vaccines that were reported by other laboratories under different conditions. MECHANISMS OF M2e-BASED VACCINES IN CONFERRING CROSS PROTECTION AGAINST INFLUENZA [7](#B7)). Moreover, anti-M2e antibodies bind strongly to the virus-infected cells, proposing indirect mechanisms of protection. Non-neutralizing antibody-mediated protective mechanisms are antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytolysis (CDC), preventing the release of viral particles into the extracellular fluids, and/or enhancing the uptake by phagocytic cells. Potential immune mechanisms by which M2e-based vaccines or M2e antibodies confer protection are summarized in the [Table 1](#T1). Roles of Fc receptors in conferring antibodies [38](#B38) [39](#B39) [40](#B40) [41](#B41) receptor (FcR)-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages plays a pivotal role in clearance of influenza A virus-infected cells ( [44](#B44) [45](#B45)). Previous studies have shown that anti-M2e antibodies passively transferred could mediate protection against influenza infection in vivo ( [13](#B13) [46](#B46)). Given the fact nonneutralizing antibodies, FcR-mediated opsonophagocytosis by macrophages could be essential for M2e-specific antibody-mediated immune protection. El Bakkouri et al. demonstrated that alveolar macrophages and FcR-dependent elimination of influenza A virus-infected cells are crucial for protection by anti-M2e IgG using passive immunization experiments in wild-type and FcR common chain deficient (FcR -/-) mice models as well as a conditional cell depletion and adoptive transfer protocol ( [47](#B47)). Moreover, Song et al. also reported that cross protection against influenza A virus by M2e-immune sera is mediated by dendritic cells and macrophages as by depletion experiments ( [20](#B20)). [48](#B48)). M2e antibodies in FcR -/- mice were induced at similar levels and showed equal protective capacity as observed in wild type BALB/c mice. However, M2e5x VLP-immunized FcR -/- mice were much less protected than M2e5x VLP-immunized wild type mice after lethal challenge. In contrast, FcR -/- mice that were immunized with inactivated influenza virus effectively induced hemagglutination inhibition (virus neutralizing) activity and were well protected. These studies indicate that HA-based vaccines inducing virus neutralizing antibodies confer strain-specific protection in an Fc receptor independent mechanism whereas M2e antibodymediated cross protection requires Fc receptors ( [48](#B48)). In line with this mechanism, immune sera with M2e antibodies showed much less protective efficacies in FcR -/- mice compared to those in wild type mice using a modified passive immunization approach ( [10](#B10) [30](#B30)). Taken together, a possible explanation is that M2e-specific antibodies are contributing to protection via FcR expressing host immune cell-dependent mechanisms because these antibodies cannot directly neutralize influenza A virus. Alternatively, anti-M2e antibodies may promote the adaptive response by enhancing uptake of antibody-bound virions via dendritic cells and macrophages which are not by themselves sufficient for protection. It is also possible that immune-complex activated dendritic cells and macrophages further contribute to increasing antiviral IFN--secreting T cell responses. Roles of natural killer cells in conferring cross protection by M2 immune responses [35](#B35)). In mice, contradictory findings have been reported with regards to the involvement of ADCC by NK and/or NK T cells in M2e-mediated protection ( [35](#B35) [49](#B49)). Jegerlehner et al. proposed an important role for ADCC by NK cells in acquiring anti-M2e immunity ( [35](#B35)). Meanwhile, other studies ( [49](#B49) [50](#B50)) argued for a different immune mechanism by M2e-mediated protection rather than NK cell-mediated ADCC. Considering several differences in experimental protocols, it is difficult to reconcile contradictory findings on the role of NK cells in the M2e-mediated protection in mice. Recently, it has been reported that human NK cell-mediated ADCC against M2-expressing cells and chemokine secretion from NK cells were enhanced presence of human anti-M2e monoclonal antibody Ab1-10 ( [51](#B51)). Thus, it is likely that NK cells may contribute to M2e immune mediated protection via multiple mechanisms. Roles of complement protein C3 in conferring cross protection by M2e vaccines [52](#B52) [53](#B53) [54](#B54)). Beebe et al. reported that complement can bind to influenza virus in the presence of virus-specific antibodies ( [55](#B55)). Moreover, the classical complement pathway can be activated by antigen-antibody immune complexes, ultimately leading to CDC. However, the role of complement in M2e-mediated immune response is also controversial. Jegerlehner et al. demonstrated that the complement component C3 is not critical for anti-M2e antibody-mediated protection by intraperitoneal passive transfer of M2e-immune sera ( [35](#B35)). In contrast, Wang et al. suggested that complement is required for reducing lung viral loads in infected mice using passive immunization of human anti-M2e monoclonal antibodies in C3-/- mice model ( [56](#B56)). This discrepancy might be due to the differences in experimental protocols. The IgG2a isotype antibody is known to be involved in binding to FcRs more effectively than particles used in showed that endpoint titers of M2e-specific IgG1 isotype antibody were approximately that of M2e-specific IgG2a isotype antibody ( [23](#B23)). It is possible that a profile of specific IgG isotypes might play a role in differential effects on the dependency of FcRs or complement. Further studies are needed to better understand the possible roles of complement C3 in conferring protection by using an appropriate vaccine that can elicit a T helper type 1-biased antibody immune response. Roles of M2e-specific T cell responses in conferring M2e immunity by vaccination [60](#B60)). Activated influenza-specific T cells have been shown to be associated with protection against influenza in human studies ( [61](#B61) [62](#B62)). Several studies have shown that M2e-specific T cells can mediate protection against influenza infection in vivo ( [16](#B16) [19](#B19) [30](#B30) an M2e-specific CD4+ T cell but not CD8+ T cell response was induced in BALB/c mice that were intranasally immunized with protein fusion vaccine (CTA1-M2e-DD of cholera toxin subunit A1 and a dimer of the D-fragment of Staphylococcus aureus protein A) in the presence of immune stimulatory complex ISCOMS adjuvant ( [19](#B19)). Anti-influenza CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity is also known to contribute to recovery from influenza infection in mice ( [63](#B63)). Other studies have demonstrated the presence of MHC class I or II restricted epitopes in M2e in mice or human ( [64](#B64) [65](#B65) [66](#B66)). Although it is not clear why there is discrepancy in T cell responses among different studies, differences in immunization protocols such as the platforms of vaccines and adjuvants, strains of animals, routes of immunization and with or without adjuvants may affect the differential outcomes of immune responses. [16](#B16)), BALB/c mice that were immunized with M2-DNA prime and adenovirus boost were treated with CD4, CD8, or CD4 plus CD8 antibodies prior to viral challenge. M2-DNA/adenovirus immune mice with depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell but not either single CD4+ or CD8+ T cell showed significant lower efficacy of survival protection indicating the roles of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in conferring M2 immunity ( [16](#B16)). Using a similar approach, Kim et al. have reported differential effects on the roles of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in mice that were immunized split vaccine plus M2e5x VLP ( [30](#B30)). Split-M2e5x VLP immune mice with depletion of CD4+ T cells showed significant more weight loss than the CD8+ T cell depleted mice, indicating that CD4+ T cells appeared to play a greater role than CD8+ T cells in conferring cross protection ( [30](#B30)). Of course, severe weight loss was observed in Split-M2e5x VLP immune mice with depletion of both CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, providing further evidence that both CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells play an important role conferring cross protection via M2e-based vaccines. In line with these above studies, M2e5x VLP immune FcR -/- mice induced higher frequency of M2e-specific IFN--producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as lower lung viral titers compared to those of na\u00efve FcR -/- mice post challenge ( [48](#B48)). Therefore, it is likely that M2e-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity plays an important role during recovery from illness caused by influenza virus infection if immunogenic M2e vaccines are used to induce T cell immunity. SUPPLEMENTED VACCINATIONS WITH A REALISTIC GOAL OF CONFERRING BROADER CROSS PROTECTION [29](#B29)). In a recent study to further support the concept of supplemented vaccination, co-immunization with licensed split vaccine plus M2e5x VLP significantly improved the efficacy of cross protection compared to that of split vaccine alone ( [30](#B30)). Also, immune sera from supplemented vaccination were shown to confer improved cross protection in na\u00efve mice ( [30](#B30)). In real world, most humans have a certain level of pre-existing immunity to influenza either by vaccination or natural infection. To mimic this heterogeneity with pre-existing immunity, mice that were previously immunized with split vaccine were subsequently immunized with M2e5x VLPs and evaluated to assess the cross protective efficacy against heterosubtypic viruses ( [22](#B22)). Subsequent supplemental immunization with M2e5x VLPs significantly enhanced the cross protective efficacy of pre-existing HA immunity ( [22](#B22)). To further move forward this concept of supplementation with a conserved M2e epitope vaccine to clinical trials, the efficacy of M2e5x VLP supplementation should be tested in a more relevant ferret animal model.
