Detoxification is a natural function of a healthy body, through ways of sweating, breathing, going to the bathroom, etc. Your liver is responsible for cleansing everything in your blood 24 hours a day, 365 days a year without rest; therefore, with the multitude of toxins, GMO's and stress, our bodies and liver are burdened to a point where they no longer detox like they should. Most people experience an increased sense of wellbeing, improvement in pain and fatigue levels, enhanced cognitive function and moods, more effective sleep and wake cycles and weight loss when completing a detox protocol. Signs & Symptoms That You Need to Detox: - constipation - persistent headaches, muscle aches, and muscle fatigue - inclusion of large amounts of swordfish, tuna, shark, etc. into diet - mercury fillings and dental amalgams - food allergies - stubborn weight loss - hormonal imbalances and consistent use of hormone replacement such as \"the pill\" or progesterone cream - consistent use of NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen - skin abnormalities such as acne, rosacea, or eczema - a lifetime of consuming the SAD diet - exposed to any of the chemicals What You Need for Liver Detoxification Phase I and Phase II support: - Milk thistle seed extract - Dandelion root extract - Gotu kola - HCl healthy bile synthesis and elimination: - Dandelion root extract - Milk thistle seed extract - Ginger root - Phosphatidylcholine - Taurine Tips to Detox Daily 1. Buy a Water Filter Buy a water filter, it's much cheaper than a whole house system and better than reverse osmosis. I also highly recommend a filtered water bottle you can travel with. 2. Coffee Enema Coffee enemas stimulate bile flow, mechanically clean the colon and can help loosen and remove bacteria and pathogens from the body. Coffee enemas also reduce liver toxicity, making it great for anyone with an overabundance of toxins in their body. 3. Switch to Safer Products The average personal care product contains 32 harmful chemicals. 4. Plant Based Diet Our body detoxes more efficiently when we eat an organic, plant-based diet that limits or avoids conventional dairy and meat products, gluten, soy, artificial sweeteners, preservatives and refined sugar. 5. Skin Brushing Skin brushing stimulates the lymphatic system to help your body remove toxins from the body. Dry brush right before hopping in the sauna or shower so you can sweat or rinse off any of the dead skin cells. 6. Get Regular Are you going to the bathroom 1-2x day every day? If not, you, like so many others, are constipated. 7. Ayurveda Tongue Scraping & Oil Pulling There are a few powerful ways to remove toxins from the body, one of which takes less than a minute before you brush your teeth. Tounge scraping involves scraping the top of your tongue with a stainless steel u-shaped tool to remove 'ama' (white colored toxins) from the tongue. Oil pulling consists of swishing around an organic oil, such as sesame oil, in your mouth for 10-15 minutes and then washing the mouth with warm salty water to remove all the bad stuff. 8. Infrared Sauna Infrared saunas can help with countless health conditions including candida, brain fog, lifelong, chronic sinus infections, gut dysbiosis, parasites and heavy metals. Infrared saunas heat your core temperature and make you really sweat, unlike normal saunas. 9. Epsom Salt Bath Epsom salt baths are a wonderful way to detoxify the body and lower stress. The epsom salt detoxifies the liver and provides your body with magnesium and sulfate, both essential minerals for detoxification and the lavender calms the body.
