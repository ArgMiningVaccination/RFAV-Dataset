Others affect only lo- cal or state industries when they rear their ugly heads. But when a disease has the potential to shutter the global horse breeding industry, controlling it becomes crucial. One of those diseas-es is equine viral arteritis (EVA). For - tunately, veterinarians have vaccines against this disease at their disposal to help control its spread. At the equine arteritis virus (EAV) symposium hosted by the University of Kentucky's Gluck Equine Research Center, Peter J. Timoney, FRCVS, PhD, reviewed EVA vaccines and the current vaccination recommendations. Timon-ey is a professor and former department chair and director of the Gluck Center. Why Horses Need Protection Before deciding whether to vaccinate against a disease, it's important to un- derstand how that disease impacts af-fected animals and how it could impact breeding industries around the globe. So Timoney began with a review. Equine viral arteritis is a contagious viral disease (caused by the equine arte-ritis virus, or EAV) that can cause fever, respiratory illness, ocular inflamma-tion, edema (swelling, especially of the limbs), birth of weak or sick foals, and abortion. Not all affected horses show clinical signs, and when they do, signs can be subtle. It is mainly transmitted via semen through natural cover or ar - tificial insemination and can also be spread via the respiratory route. Adult horses usually make full clini- cal recoveries with or without support-ive treatment such as non-steroidal anti- inflammatories (NSAIDs) and antibiotics. However, if the virus isn't cleared from a stallion's body within a few weeks he runs the risk of becoming a carrier, meaning he won't show clini-cal signs of disease, but he's still capa-ble of shedding\u2014and spreading\u2014the virus. Persistently infected carrier stal- lions function as EAV's natural reser - voir, and they disseminate the virus to susceptible mares at breeding at a rate of 85-100%. Such an outbreak could devastate breeding industries\u2014local, national, and global. Once a stallion is a carrier, rendering him EVA-negative can be a serious challenge. Because EVA re-lies on testosterone to persist, some car - riers are gelded to eliminate the virus. Scientists first isolated the virus and characterized it as a disease agent in 1957, but it wasn't until 1984 that the first case was recorded in a Thorough-bred horse in Kentucky, Timoney ex-plained. The disease spread rapidly across Kentucky breeding farms, and authorities worldwide took notice. From this outbreak, Timoney said, sev- eral industry concerns arose, including: The risk of disease spread through the international movement of hors-es and/or semen; The potential for major outbreaks in populations of naive mares; The risk of illness and death in young foals; andEVA Vaccines: What You Need to Know Nearly 100% of Thoroughbred stallions in Kentucky are now vaccinated against EVA.anne m. eberhardtArticles of Interest EVA: A European Perspective Should I Deworm my Horse in the Winter?

But between countries, regu-latory bodies, and animal health profes-sionals, there often remains a difference in perspective when it comes to handling these diseases. At the equine arteritis virus (EAV) symposium hosted by the Gluck Equine Research Center, Richard Newton, BVSc, MSc, PhD, FRCVS, Head of Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance at The Animal Health Trust, in Newmar - ket, England, provided a European per - spective on one potentially dangerous venereal disease: equine viral arteritis (EVA). What is EVA? Newton explained that EVA is a viral disease first identified in the 1950s in the United States during the \"pioneering heyday of virology.\" The first case wasn't identified in the United Kingdom until March 1993, after mares were bred to a recently imported stallion shedding the virus. The stallion had been falsely cer - tified as negative for the virus prior to import. Today the infection is found nearly Stallions becoming carriers.International movement regulations and testing re-quirements quickly took ef-fect after the 1984 outbreak. \"To this day, EVA remains one of the most internation- ally regulated equine diseas- es,\" Timoney said. Current prevention and control programs are pri-marily focused on restricting EAV spread to both minimize the risk of virus-related abor - tions and to prevent stallions from becoming carriers, he said. And one of the main ways to control EAV spread is via vaccination. Current Vaccines Timoney said the two vac- cines available to today's breeders (Arvac and Ar - tervac, both produced by Zo-etis) are based on research conducted in the 1960s, but are both safe and effective for reducing the risk of EVA. Arvac is a modified-live virus vaccine (one that in-cludes a weakened virus that no longer produces clinical disease, but retains the abil-ity to induce a protective im-mune response) that's been used in the United States and Canada since 1985; it's also been used on a limited scale in New Zealand, he said. It's been confirmed safe for use in all horses except for mares in the final two months of gestation and in foals less than six weeks of age, Tim-oney said. Adverse vaccine reactions are uncommon. Regarding efficacy, Tim- oney said, Arvac \"stimulates effective protection against clinical disease and estab- lishment of the carrier state in stallions.\" Further, vacci-nated stallions and their se- men can be exported to other countries including Japan, which will only accept stal- lions vaccinated against EVA. Artervac is an inactivated vaccine (it does not contain viable or infectious virus, but still stimulates an immune response) licensed for use in a number of European coun-tries; it is not commercially available in North America. This vaccine has also been proven safe and \"reputedly effective\" for use in stallions and mares, Timoney said. Vaccination & Manage- ment Recommendations \"Vaccination is primarily targeted at protecting breed-ing stallions against estab-lishment of the carrier state,\" Timoney said. He recom-mended annual vaccination for noncarrier stallions three to four weeks before the breeding season, and many breeders and veterinarians are following that advice: According to statistics from Kentucky Department of Ag-riculture Equine Programs manager E.S. \"Rusty\" Ford, nearly 100% of stallions in the commonwealth are vac-cinated against EVA. Timoney noted that man- datory vaccination only applies to Thoroughbred stal- lions and only in the states of Kentucky and New York. Timoney also recommend- ed vaccinating immature colts (6 to 12 months old) to minimize the risk that they'll become carriers later in life. He said that while vac- cination protocols are pri- marily targeted at protecting stallions from becoming car - riers rather than preventing abortion in mares prophylac-tically, mares should still be vaccinated in some situations. \"Vaccination of pregnant mares is strongly indicated in the face of high risk of ex-posure to natural EAV infec-tion,\" even if they're in late gestation, he said. Timoney also provided sev- eral other recommendations for controlling EVA: Identify carriers, separate them from other breed-ing stallions, and restrict their matings to mares that have been vaccinated against EVA or are natu-rally seropositive (having antibodies against EAV in their blood serum); If a naive mare is bred to a stallion shedding EAV, isolate her from seronega- tive horses for three weeks to prevent virus spread; If using artificial insemina- tion, screen semen prior to breeding; if the semen tests positive for EAV, only use it in mares that have been vaccinated against EVA or are naturally seropositive; Employ sound manage-ment and biosecurity prac- tices for broodmares; and If breeding stock resides on a facility that sees hors- es coming and going with limited isolation space, it's highly recommended to vaccinate all at-risk equids.He also directed attend- ees to the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Ser - vice's resources on manag- ing and controlling EVA and rules and regulations associ- ated with the disease. Take-Home Message When it comes to EVA, many horse owners and vet- erinarians worldwide have a similar goal: minimize dis- ease spread. One of the most important steps in achieving that goal is to implement a proper vaccination regimen for breeding stock. Consult your veterinarian to deter - mine when it's appropriate to vaccinate your stallions and broodmares against EVA. >erica Larson is the news editor for The horse and Thehorse.com.EVA Vaccines In Europe, EVA is most prevalent in Warmbloods and Standardbreds.istock.com3 Bluegrass Zealand cials recently announced that the country has become EVA-free, Newton said\u2014and is prevalent in most European countries. Although previous outbreaks have oc-curred in Thoroughbreds, the infection is currently much more prevalent in Warm-bloods and Standardbreds, said Newton. Horses can spread the disease efficient- ly via semen or somewhat less efficiently via respiratory secretions. Adult horses usually make full clinical recoveries with or without supportive treatment such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) and antibiotics. Clinical signs are variable and often absent and include: Fever; Depression; Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva lining the inner eyelids); Edema (fluid swelling) Skin rashes; and Abortion in pregnant mares.Affected horses that don't show clini- cal signs still shed the virus, Newton said. If the virus isn't cleared from a stallion's body within a few weeks, he runs the risk of becoming a carrier. Per - sistently infected carrier stallions func-tion as natural reservoirs of EAV, and they disseminate the virus to susceptible mares at breeding. Newton stressed that virus shedding is testosterone-dependent, so immature colts won't become carriers, and castra-tion can stop carriers from shedding the virus. Control Measures in the U.K. In the United States EVA is not a re- portable disease, and there are no codes of practice to limit its spread. The Amer - ican Association of Equine Practitio-ners has, however, issued guidelines for EVA prevention, and import regulations are aimed at preventing a foreign horse from bringing EVA into the country. Newton said organizations in Europe have taken steps to limit EVA spread, in-cluding the following regulations: The EVA Order In 1995 the U.K. gov- ernment passed The EVA Order, making the condition a notifiable disease in stal- lions if: A stallion is unexpectedly found to be seropositive (having antibodies against EAV in his blood serum); The virus is detected in a semen sam- ple; or Disease is identified in mares with- in 14 days of live cover or artificial insemination.Under the Order, the U.K.'s Depart- ment for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs can report publically when stal-lions test positive, he added. The Order states that stallions can be declared EVA-free following: Castration; A negative virus isolation test on se-men; or Test mating two mares at the owner's expense; however, Newton said the British government does not favor this method. HBLB Codes of Practice Each year Britain's Horserace Betting Levy Board (HBLB) issues Codes of Practice for deal-ing with a number of equine infectious diseases, including EVA. The document encourages veterinarians and owners to: Blood test stallions annually after Jan-uary 1; Vaccinate stallions against the disease at six-month intervals; Blood test mares annually after Janu-ary 1 and within 28 days before breed-ing; and Blood test imported animals within 28 days of import and while the horses are still in their 21-day quarantine. Newton also noted that, although Thoroughbreds cannot be produced via artificial insemination and embryo transfer under internationally agreed rules governing breed registration, the HBLB Codes of Practice does include information on preventing EVA in such scenarios. BEVA Guide to the Use of Artificial Insemination in Horse Breeding The British Equine Veterinary Association (BEVA) has also issued guidelines on preventing EVA spread when using ar - tificial insemination. These guidelines recommend blood tests prior to pur - chase or import to ensure the horse is EVA-negative. They also recommend using semen that's been declared EVA-free and that importers retest semen once it's arrived in the U.K. if there are any doubts re-garding its status. Additionally, Newton said, the guide- lines include recommendations for man-aging seropositive competition stallions, which often travel to different countries on a regular basis. The guidelines rec-ommend isolating the affected stallion EVA: A European Perspective MASTHEAD University of Kentucky Ag Equine Programs Jenny evans, mF a, interim executive director of the Gluck equine research Foundation, jenny.evans@uky.edu holly Wiemers, ma, aPr, managing editor, holly.wiemers@uky.edu Bluegrass Equine Digest Advisory Board Bob coleman, Phd , Pas, associate professor, director of undergraduate studies for equine science and management and extension horse specialist david horohov, ms , Phd , interim chair of uk's department of Veterinary science and interim director of the uk Gluck equine research center ed squires, Phd , dipl. acT (hon.), professor, uk Gluck equine research center Jill stowe, Phd , director of uk ag equine Programs and associate professor in the department of agricultural economics Bluegrass Equine Digest Editorial Committee craig carter, dVm, Phd , dipl. acVPm, director and professor of the uk Veterinary diagnostic Laboratory Laurie Lawrence, Phd , professor in the department of animal and food sciences ray smith, Phd , professor and forage extension specialist William W.

The directives state that semen must come from stallions that are certified clinically disease-free and were held for 30 days on an EVA-free premises prior to collection, and the stallion's semen must have tested negative for EVA. Additionally, stallions being imported into the EU from non-EU countries must be seronegative for EVA or test negative prior to vaccination, if vaccinated. Risks Remain Newton cautioned that the EC direc- tives deal well with semen trade be- tween EU member states, but noted that no regulations exist regarding stallion movement between EU member states. This, he said, means that individuals and each nation's horse industry must protect itself against EVA and, therefore, rely on other individuals' good practices. This poses another challenge, said Newton, such as the varying attitudes re-garding EVA between the U.K. and some other European countries, and between the Thoroughbred sector and other breeds. While some breeders exercise extreme caution when shipping semen or stallions, he said others don't consider it a problem and continue to ship EVA-positive or carrier stallions or semen, sometimes with directions to vaccinate mares prior to breeding. As a result, it's often up to individual horse owners to employ good practices and protect their own horses. Newton offered a recommendation he first pre-sented in a study that was published in the UK's Veterinary Record in 1999 fol-lowing the 1993 U.K. EVA outbreak, not-ing it \"stands true today as much as it did last century\": \"As there have been no statutory re- quirements since 1993 to demonstrate that stallions moving between EU coun-tries are free of EAV, these results high-light the potential risks posed to the largely susceptible U.K. horse popula-tion by the importation from within the EU of stallions which are shedding the virus. In the absence of such statutory import requirements, the authors rec-ommend that all potential purchasers of stallions from other EU states should establish the EVA serological status of these animals before they are purchased and imported into the U.K.\" Vaccination Newton also touched briefly on the available EVA vaccines and their issues. He said one concern is that in the U.K. the only product available is an inacti- vated, whole-virus vaccine; conversely, in the United States, the only available vaccine is a modified-live vaccine. Inac-tivated, whole-virus vaccines might not always induce an immune response, and the response might not be long-lived, meaning horses might require more frequent boosters to maintain ad-equate protection. So, it's not surprising that study results have shown that first-season sires are often poorly protected against EVA without more frequent boosters, Newton said. Additionally, he said, there are oc- casional supply issues. For instance, a 2003 outbreak in Ireland coincided with a diminished vaccine supply. A better understanding of ideal vacci- nation protocols and improved supplies could help better protect horses against EVA, he said. Take-Home Message Newton left attendees with three im- portant points to remember about EVA in Europe: Unrestricted stallion movement within the EU continues to pose a risk to the European horse industry; there's a great need to improve owners' and vet-erinarians' compliance with voluntary disease control measures such as those outlined in the HBLB's Codes of Practice; and the veterinary industry is in need of better ways to monitor and improve laboratory testing, vaccination protocols, and vaccines. Improvements on these fronts can help reduce the spread of this costly and dangerous disease. >erica Larson is the news editor for The horse and Thehorse.com.EVA: A European Perspective Should I Deworm My Horse in the Winter? QIs it worthwhile to deworm my horses during the winter? I've heard that internal parasites aren't around this time of year. heaTher, Via e-maiL Ayes, you are correct that we recommend deworming horses during the active grazing season rather than during the winter. The reason is that the small strongyles tend to arrest their development over the winter at the larval stage. most of the available dewormers have no ef-fect against these arrested larvae, and the few that do are only partially effective. The arrested development can lead to an accumulation of small stron- gyle larvae in the mucosal walls of the large intestine. if a large number of these larvae are present in a horse, deworming it at this time might actually cause more harm than good. most dewormers mainly act on the adult parasites present in the lumen of the intestine, and removing these may activate the arrested larvae and cause them to mass emerge from their encysted stage. This can lead to serious diarrhea. There are situations where it can be necessary to deworm a horse during the winter months, such as if the horse hasn't been dewormed adequately during the latter part of the grazing season. other examples of winter deworming include foals that harbor ascarid parasites, which aren't seasonal to the same extent as the strongyles. in both cases you should consult with your veterinarian regarding your choice of dewormer. We find that horses actively shed parasite eggs year-round, but there is a tendency toward lower counts in the off-season months. This makes sense from the parasite's standpoint, as winter conditions do not favor parasite transmission. so the bottom line is that we don't typically recommend treatments directed at strongyle parasites during the winter months in the colder climates. remember, though, that in warmer climates (i.e., the southern united states) parasite transmission is more likely to occur during the winter than in the hot summers. most importantly, make sure your de-wormers are working by running fecal exams to determine parasite egg counts before and after treatments. >martin krarup nielsen, - sitologist, veterinarian, and assistant professor at the university of k en- tucky Gluck equine center.5 Bluegrass university of k entucky horse Pasture evaluation Program has now completed 10 years of work on horse farms in central kentucky and across the state. over this time, the program has grown tremendously and has had a significant impact on the horse industry and the university of kentucky college of agriculture, Food and environment. The idea of having university experts evaluate commercial and pri- vate horse farms' pasture composition began after the 2001/2002 mare reproductive loss syndrome (mrLs) outbreak. during this time of uncer - tainty, the potential benefits for a partnership between uk and the horse industry were very clear. in 2005 the uk equine initiative (now uk ag equine Programs) was born. one program that began within the initiative was the uk horse Pasture evaluation Program, developed by ray smith, Phd, professor and forage extension specialist within uk's plant and soil sciences department, and Tom k eene, hay marketing specialist within the same department. in its inception year (2005), university experts evaluated 14 farms (rep- resenting 1,260 acres) for species composition and sampled for tall fes- cue endophyte presence and ergovaline concentration. during 2014 they evaluated 17 farms, totaling more than 6,600 acres. additional services have been added, including ergovaline analysis, GPs mapping of sample locations, and tracking of pasture composition changes over time. While the data collected in this program is valuable, the program does not mea-sure its success based on the numbers, but on the impacts to farms and kentucky's horse industry. since its inception, program experts have visited 111 individual farms in 20 different k entucky counties, many of which have asked the pro- gram to assess their pastures year after year. These contacts have be-come friends of uk's college of agriculture, Food and environment and provide continued support and collaborations when needed. several of these farms have welcomed on-farm research projects ranging from pasture management to weed control and even horse health. Farms have also supported extension events by attending or hosting events, including the annual winter program \"Pastures Please!!\" and the annual summer equine field day \"equine Farm and Facilities expo.\" in 2015 Pas- tures Please!! will be held Feb. 5 at the Fayette county extension office from 6-8:30 p.m. The horse Pasture evaluation Program encompasses all three facets of the university of k entucky: research, extension, and teaching. detailed information from more than 1,500 individual pastures or paddocks has given researchers a large dataset and a great understanding of k entucky horse pastures. This information is used for everything from on-farm rec- ommendations to guiding extension programs and educational materials. in addition, the program teaches students. over the past 10 years, several graduate-level students, including Joy Lowry, Laura schwer, and current coordinator krista Lea, have operated the program. additionally, the program has employed around 20 undergraduate students from as- bury university and the university of k entucky, with majors ranging from equine science and management to human health, Biology, and mission outreach. This program's success is due in large part to the hard work and dedication of many students over the years that have taken a sum-mer job and turned it into a learning and teaching experience. Finally, this program would not exist without the support and collabo- ration it has received from uk's college of agriculture, Food and environ- ment. each year departments across campus, including uk ag equine Programs, Weed science, animal and Food science, the Gluck equine re- search center, regulatory services, and the Veterinary diagnostic Labo-ratory, collaborate. >krista Lea, ms , assistant coordinator of uk's horse Pasture evaluation Program; ray smith, Phd , professor and forage extension specialist; and Tom k eene, hay marketing specialist, all within the university of k entucky department of Plant and soil sciences, provided this information.UK Horse Pasture Evaluation Program: 10-Year Review For more information on the UK Horse Pasture Evaluation Program, visit its facebook page at facebook.com/ UKHorsePastureEvaluation?ref=hl or contact ukforageextension@uky.edu. www.uky.edu/ag/forages Pastures\u00b7Specific Recommendations\u00b7Compehensive Report The programs goals are to: \u00b7 Provide detailed pasture management recommendations to horse farm owners and managers. \u00b7 Improve pastureland by increasing forage quality and quantity and reduce the need for stored feeds such as hay and grain. \u00b7 Assess the potential risk of fescue toxicity for pregnant broodmares on pasture. \u00b7 Program is available to horse farms across the state regardless of farm size, breed or discipline.

ACVIM, ACVS, Practitioners (AAEP) Founda- tion Past Presidents' Research Fellow for her research into articular cartilage repair of degenerative joint disease, the leading cause of lameness and retire- ment in all breeds and disciplines of equine athletes. Adam was recognized Dec. 8 dur - ing the Frank J. Milne State-of-the-Art Lecture at the AAEP's 60th Annual Con-vention, which took place Dec. 6-10 in Salt Lake City, Utah. The $5,000 grant is awarded annually to a doctoral or resi-dency student who has made significant progress in the field of equine health care research.Adam's research seeks to enhance un- derstanding of articular chondrocytes' exact gene expression in order to reca-pitulate them experimentally as therapy cells for articular cartilage lesions. Using RNA-sequencing scrutiny of the genes expressed in cartilage at different stages of development, the goal is to obtain new insight and knowledge into what defines a mature, robust articular chondrocyte. Such understanding will advance thera-peutic efforts to generate and support fully functional articular cartilage cells during tissue repair. Adam received her veterinary degree from the Royal Veterinary College at the University of London in 1993. She com-pleted her large animal internal medi-cine residency at Texas A&M University in 2004 and large animal surgery resi-dency at the University of Pennsylvania's New Bolton Center in 2007. Her PhD dissertation research is being conducted at the University of Kentucky's Gluck Equine Research Center under the men-torship of James MacLeod, VMD, PhD. \"We are delighted to honor Dr. Adam and thank her for continuing her educa-tion and career toward equine research,\" said AAEP Foundation Chairman Jeff Berk, VMD. \"If our knowledge of horse health is going to continue to advance, we must encourage and financially sup-port more veterinarians to become re-searchers like Dr. Adam.\" The AAEP Foundation established the Past Presidents' Research Fellow in 2006. The award is made possible through the monetary contributions of AAEP past presidents.

Seminar Series Schedule Set for 20158 Bluegrass Equine Digest ca.uky.edu/equine TheHorse.com December 2014A New Breed of Funding Until about a year ago, I had heard the terms \"crowdfunding\" and \"crowdsourcing\" several times with- out fully understanding what they meant. When my wife made a small donation toward a musician's efforts to raise enough money to release her first album, I started to get an idea of what this was all about. The musician had posted a project description on a crowdfunding website called Kick- starter and invited people to make donations online. Word then spread through social media. The campaign was successful, and the musician reached her goal. Soon thereafter, I was listening to NPR while driving to work one morn-ing. The station was broadcasting a feature about scientists using crowd-funding to raise funding for their re-search. The concept was the same as for the musician, but instead of an al-bum the final product would be a fund-ed research project. The key to success was still effective communication by means of social media. I immediately thought this would be worth trying. Through the years I have been study- ing equine parasitology, I have always enjoyed how horse owners appreciate science. The Horse's magazine, website, and newsletters serve as an excellent il-lustration of this; people genuinely like science and they want updated infor - mation. I figured this would provide a good foundation for a crowdfunding project. Furthermore, I felt my research topic, parasitology, would be a com-mon denominator across various horse breeds, uses, and geographic locations. No matter what, horses will always have worms, and owners will always have opinions about and experiences with controlling them. No one from the University of Ken- tucky had tried crowdfunding for re- search projects before. But there was a lot of interest in it, and a crowd-funding task force had already been established. Before I knew it, I had become the university's first pilot re- search crowdfunding project, examin- ing a promising alternative treatment modality to reduce our reliance on existing dewormers to which parasites are developing resistance.

By doing this, we had the free- dom to design the site as we wanted it, we would avoid paying the fees associat-ed with using a commercial crowdfund-ing website, and American residents could obtain tax credit for their dona- tions. With help from many excellent people at the University of Kentucky, we were able to leverage the already exist-ing online donation system to develop a website as well as three promotional videos. We set up a Twitter account and made use of already existing Facebook and LinkedIn accounts to promote the project. We used an online group email-ing service to communicate with donors and supporters.The crowdfunding campaign launched in the beginning of January 2014 and ran for two months. During this time our page was shared and retweeted well over 400 times, the videos have been viewed more than 2,000 times, about 300 unique users signed up on the website, and we raised more than $8,500. Further, the campaign has greatly promoted our re- search program, as we have appeared in several news articles and were hosted on radio shows. Interestingly, we have had some substantial donations come in after we stopped campaigning, and they don't show signs of stopping. We intend to keep the site open and provide regular updates about our project and future campaigns. Our ultimate goal with this project is to develop a probiotic-type product for horses, but the first step is to test it against equine parasites in the labora-tory. This is what we will use the crowd-funding money for, and we have already started the work. Preliminary data show a very good effect of our test bacteria against equine small strongyles, and we are continuing to evaluate this further.
