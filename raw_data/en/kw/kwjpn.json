The Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine is also authorized to provide a first booster dose at least six months after completion of primary vaccination with an authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine to individuals 18 years of age and older for whom an FDA-authorized mRNA bivalent COVID-19 booster vaccine is not accessible or clinically appropriate, and to individuals 18 years of age and older who elect to receive the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine because they would otherwise not receive a booster dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.

Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine SARS-CoV-2 Variants On Aug. 22, 2023, Novavax [announced](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/novavaxs-updated-protein-based-xbb-covid-vaccine-induced-neutralizing-responses-against-emerging-subvariants-including-eg5-1-and-xbb1-16-6--301906172.html) its 2023-2024 season COVID vaccine candidate induced neutralizing responses to emerging subvariants EG.5.1 and XBB.1.16.6 XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and XBB.2.3. The [JAMA Network](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2804216) reported on Apr. 26, 2023, high levels of humoral responses at day 35 were observed in adolescents (as determined by both anti-S-binding IgG antibodies and functional microneutralization and hACE2 receptor-binding inhibition assays) against prototype virus as well as against more recent Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Mu, and Omicron variants, including Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5, which were 2 to 4 times higher than those observed in PREVENT-19 adult participants. A non-peer-reviewed [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.18.23286136v1) published on Feb. 19, 2023, estimated the risk of severe infection was 0.001 events per 1000 persons (95% CI, 0 to 0.003) for the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine and 0.002 events per 1000 persons (95% CI, 0.001 to 0.006) for BNT162b2 vaccine. On Apr. 26, 2023, the JAMA Network published an [Original Investigation](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2804216) of a [phase 3](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04611802) randomized clinical trial, which found vaccine efficacy was 79.5%, and reactogenicity mainly was mild to moderate and transient, with no safety concerns identified. And on Apr. 27, 2023, the journal [Vaccines](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2300467X#ab005) reported a study yielding a post hoc VE against hospitalization of 100% (95% CI: 28.8, 100). On Jan. 21, 2023, a peer-reviewed study published by [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-27698-x) found data showing that after a third dose of NVX-CoV2373, we observed high titers against Omicron BA.1 (GMT: 1,197) and BA.4/BA.5 (GMT: 582), with responses similar in magnitude to those triggered by three doses of an mRNA vaccine. These data are particularly relevant as BA.4/BA.5 dominates in multiple locations and highlights the potential utility of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine as a booster in resource-limited environments. Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine Vs. BNT162b2 Comparison The Journal of Infection published [results](https://www.journalofinfection.com/article/S0163-4453(23)00330-4/fulltext) from the phase II, single-blind, multi-center, randomized-controlled trial [Com-COV3 study](https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12348322) on June 16, 2023, that highlighted heterologous and fractional dose COVID-19 vaccine schedules in adolescents are safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic; NVXCoV2373 following 30\u00b5g BNT162b2 as a first dose elicited the highest humoral and peak cellular immune responses; Neutralising antibodies against Omicron BA.1 and than BNT162b2 schedule; The lowest rate of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus breakthrough infections occurred in participants who received NVXCoV2373 as their second dose; Enhanced protection may be provided by heterologous vaccine schedules using NVXCoV2373 than the homologous BNT162b2 schedule.
