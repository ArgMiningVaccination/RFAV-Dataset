Cook County metrics are calculated by the CDC and posted on the CDC Community Levels website (data as of 5/20/2022). The CDC updates the county -based COVID -19 national map weekly on Thursday evenings. With the update tonight, we expect Cook County (and therefore Chicago) to move to High COVID Community Level as of tomorrow 8What does High COVID Community Level mean for Chicagoans? Wear a mask indoors in public (yes, this means you!) Consider avoiding higher -risk activities (such as crowded indoor gatherings) Limit gatherings to small numbers Stay up to date with COVID -19 vaccines (get that booster!) Testif you have symptoms Additional precautions may be needed for people at high risk for severe disease 9Chicago: Signs of plateau/slight decrease in reported cases; however daily average cases remain high 10Current Daily Average: 1,082 Prior Week: 1,286Many first-time and mild (even asymptomatic) COVID infections right now; relatively few hospitalizations or deaths. Chi.gov/ coviddash11 Good news: Chicago COVID -19 hospitalizations have risen slightly since early April, but remain near historic lows for pandemic overall 12All-time peak was January 4, 2022: 301 Chicagoans newly hospitalized with COVID in one day Current average: 28 Chicagoans newly hospitalized with COVID each day Chi.gov/ coviddashReports still coming inHospitalizations among Chicago residents are increasing, but at a very slow rate compared to last fall and winter Increasing by ~20 hospitalizations per weekIncreasing by ~60 hospitalizations per weekIncreasing by 300-400 hospitalizations per week Data Source: Illinois' National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (I -NEDSS), pulled 5/18/2022 Population estimates are determined using the US Census 2019 American Community Survey13What does COVID hospital burden look like now in Chicago?

Public Notification and Information ALL cases reported to CDPH receive automated outreach with link to information/resources ALL cases reported to CDPH in people age 65+ continue to receive personal calls to ensure they are connected to care, aware of early treatment options, and have resources Continued outbound calling projects to higher -risk Chicagoans who are not up -to-date with vaccination 7-day staffing of Chicago's COVID -19 Resource Line: call 312-746-4835 if you need resources or have questions Intervention Outbreak investigation and response in ANY setting (workplace, events) Continued focus on testing and rapid case investigation/response in higher -risk, congregate settings Distributing rapid tests in areas of community need; educating providers on treatment availability Monitoring and Data Reporting Increased sample collection from across Chicago for specialized testing to detect new or emerging variants Increased COVID -19 wastewater surveillance Continued daily public reporting of all Chicago COVID data; hospital burden (chi.gov/ coviddash ) 31Variant Surveillance, Omicron subvariants Omicron subvariant BA.2 remains dominant strain tracker/#circulatingVariants % Viral lineage among infectionsWorried about COVID? Here are things you can do TODAY Order your free COVID -19 rapid home tests from the federal government (16 in total per address) --and use them! Covidtests.gov Get your booster now \u2014and/or ask a friend or family member if they've gotten theirs (nearly 6 in 10 Chicagoans have not) To be up -to-date, everyone age 5+ should have had a total of 3 COVID -19 vaccines by now \u2014 and those age 50+ should have had 4. Put a mask (K-N95 for best protection) in your bag, so you have it readily available for indoor wear Remember: you can spread COVID for two days before symptoms start, so especially while Chicago's risk is high, universal indoor masking helps protect your fellow Chicagoans If you're at higher risk for severe outcomes, talk to your doctor and make a treatment plan now in case you do get COVID For example: does your doctor prescribe Paxlovid ? Would he/she recommend early treatment (oral or IV) for you if you do get COVID? Does your regular pharmacy stock Paxlovid ? 33 No need to stock up on toilet paper! As long as the vaccines and treatments continue to work as well as they are now, we're not heading back toward lockdowns. No need to avoid all human interaction! Please talk to your doctor if you are immunocompromised at high risk of severe outcomes, but given the combination of vaccines and early treatments, most Chicagoans Please do NOT try to \"get COVID to get it over with.\" This does nothing to help us get over COVID as a city! Know that the City of Chicago continues to monitor COVID -19 closely and take it seriously. If COVID threatens our local hospitals and healthcare capacity, we will take further action (e.g. city - wide indoor mask mandates) But we don't want to get there. Everyone taking some extra precautions for the next few weeks, while we remain in High, will help protect our hospitals; prevent unnecessary illness; and save lives. 34Worried about COVID?

Rare but potentially serious viral illness that spreads through contact with body fluids, sores, or shared items such as bedding that have been contaminated with these fluids CDPH is closely monitoring the outbreak - No cases have been reported in Chicago or Illinois at this point 92 cases confirmed, mostly in Europe. Another 28 cases suspected. 5 Confirmed cases in the US. --2 in NYC, 1 in Mass., 1 in Florida, 1 in Utah People with symptoms of monkeypox, particularly men who have sex with other men, should be aware of any unusual rashes or sores and contact a healthcare provider if any such symptoms are detected. 38 Photo credit: Getty ImagesHospitals in collar counties are currently experiencing greater hospital burden due to COVID -19 than Chicago/Cook hospitals Percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by those with confirmed COVID -19 CookChicagoDuPageLakeMcHenry Data Source: US Department of Health and Human Services Unified Hospital Data Surveillance System, pulled 5/18/2022 Population estimates are determined using the US Census 2019 American Community Survey39CDC Community Level for Cook County and associated Health Service Area (HSA) remains at MEDIUM this week See CDC Data Tracker for more details 40 "}
