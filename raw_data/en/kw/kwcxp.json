RefrigeratorThermo Scientific TSX 23 cu. ft. FreezerLab and clinical-grade storage that adapts to you and your environment Temperature variation can have an impact on the viability and e cacy of vaccines, medication, reagents and other temperature-sensitive materials. These variations can shorten product shelf life, degrade enzymes and reduce vaccine e ectiveness. Therefore, it is important to choose a high-performance refrigerator or freezer that has been designed for the demanding standards of the laboratory and clinical environment. The sustainable, SNAP-compliant choice Thermo Scientifi c TSX Series high-performance refrigerators and freezers are designed with features that support sample protection, sustainability objectives and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Signifi cant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP). Our variable-speed compressor technology (V-Drive) is designed to provide temperature uniformity that continually adapts to the lab or clinical environment, o ering signifi cant energy savings without compromising protection. Each product has an ACT Environmental Impact Factor Label which provides clear, third-party verifi ed information about the environmental impact of laboratory products. Whisper-quiet operation Compared to conventional-refrigerant, high-performance models, the TSX Series o ers a whisper-quiet operation, so you can bring the refrigerator or freezer out of the hallway and back into your lab without disrupting your audio environment. ENERGY STAR-certifi ed While conventional-refrigerant, high-performance refrigerators and freezers can run at very high kWh/day in energy usage, the TSX Series by comparison has been designed to reduce energy usage without compromising performance. All TSX Series products are EPA ENERGY STAR\u00ae- c e r t i fi e d . Application-specifi c models Our laboratory refrigerators feature your choice of glass or solid door with adjustable shelves. Freezers come in a choice of auto defrost 30\u00b0C or manual defrost 20\u00b0C setpoint. For blood banking applications, our plasma freezers and blood bank refrigerators are FDA Class II and AABB SCoPE-certifi ed. Our pharmacy refrigerators are NSF/ANSI 456 Vaccine Storage-certifi ed and feature convenient, adjustable basket drawers. And for enzyme storage, our 20\u00b0C freezers feature enzyme bins for convenient storage. Based on published sound specifi cations, data on fi le. October, 2016.Biologics Diagnostics kits and reagents Enzymes Industrial testing Vaccines and pharmaClinical applications Whole blood and plasmaMolecular biologyConnectivity Columns Flammable material storageThe drive for sample integrity and energy savings The performance and energy savings of the TSX Series are driven by our unique V-Drive technology . While conventional, high-performance refrigerators and freezers use single- speed compressors that continually cycle on and o , the TSX Series V-Drive runs at variable speeds to adjust cooling performance to the conditions inside and outside of the refrigerator or freezer. When combined with the automated tuning control, this variable-speed drive optimizes the compressor's running speed to the current conditions. When there are frequent door openings, or samples are added to the refrigerator or freezer, the control system detects the activity and increases the drive speed to bring temperatures back to the setpoint quickly. This innovative technology is one of the reasons the TSX Series delivers outstanding door- opening recovery (DOR) speed, and more peace of mind for busy laboratories. When conditions are stable, such as when the unit is running overnight or on weekends, the drive runs at a low speed, reducing energy consumption while maintaining a stable temperature for your samples. Adaptive control Adapting to your refrigerator or freezer usage patterns, the TSX V-Drive increases compressor speed to quickly restore temperature after door openings.V-Drive Low energy: Low operating cost Adaptive control: Sample securityStandard compressors cycle ON & OFF ON OFF Start up high speed low speed Normal running Normal running Door opening Variable-speed compressors (V-Drive) change speed. As shown in the above graphic, the TSX V-Drive, unlike standard compressors that cycle on and o , adjusts to factors such as start-up and door openings, when a higher compressor speed is needed. During normal running time when the door is closed, the V-Drive runs at a lower speed to maintain your setpoint. 34 Setpoint security Key-operated triple position switch for main power and alarm; locks in temperature and alarm setpoints to minimize setpoint error and prevent tampering Automatic defrost system Defrost sensor manages automatic defrost cycle (except manual defrost models)Graphic thermometer Easy to view: shows normal, high or low temperature condition; steady green for normal, fl ashing top bar for overtemperature, fl ashing bulb for undertemperature Door ajar Illuminated when door is left openPower failure Illuminated when main power is interrupted Battery backup Continuous charge provide full alarm function in case of power failure Low battery alarm Illuminated when the alarm system battery backup charge is lowService mode Illuminated when controller is in service programming mode Audible alarm Sounds in the event of warm, cold or power loss conditions.

The units are also compatible with Thermo Scientifi c Smart-Vue Pro wireless monitoring systems.5 A sound environment for critical samples You know that the constant noise created by compressors can compromise communications and create a less-than-ideal working environment. The new TSX Series is up to 10x quieter than our previous generation of refrigerators and freezers .* Our V-Drive technology, combined with superior insulation, limits the sound output of the TSX Series to just 52 dB , approximately the sound generated by a conventional refrigerator.** Decibel scale of common sounds.

Designed for ergonomic usage Verifi ed sustainabilityIn addition to the signifi cant reduction in sound, the TSX Series features an ergonomically designed door handle with a soft-touch grip, and the microprocessor controller is angled to help prevent neck strain. Thermo Scientifi c TSX Series Ultra-Low Freezers have completed the ACT Environmental Impact Factor Label labeling processes, which is designed to address the need of both scientists and procurement specialists for clear, third-party verifi ed information about the environmental impact of laboratory products. The criteria for the ACT label were developed with input from industry experts and external stakeholders, and the label process entails third-party verifi cation of the sustainable impacts of a product, its operations, and its end of life. up to 10x quieter 5 6 TSX Series high-performance biomedical glass door refrigerators Our high-performance glass door refrigerators combine advanced temperature control with high-quality cabinet construction and alarm systems.
