This quarter had a slight increase in complaints compared to this time last year from 81 to 83. This is a 2.5% increase in volume. The most notable increase in complaints is found in the charges/convictions received by the Board, which increased from 44 to 51. The Board is seeing more applicants with criminal histories to review and further evaluate. Additionall y, staff has dropped the average complaint intake time from seven days to four days this quarter; a 43% decrease. Last quarter's average intake time and this quarter's times are under the Board's performance measure target of ten days. Investigation Trends There are not many significant performance changes with regards to investigations. This is likely due to Enforcement staff being consistent between the two quarters as well as complaint volume being very similar. The most notable changes are the total investigations pending decreasing by 16% from 204 last quarter to 171 this quarter. Enforcement staff is working diligently to close cases in a timely manner which in turn produces a more manageable caseload . The other noteworthy change is the average investigation time decreasing b y 30% from 281 days last quarter to 196 days this quarter. This change represents the Board meeting and coming under the 200 day target for the performance measure on the average number of days to complete an investigation . Formal Discipline Trends This is the first quarter in the 15/16 fiscal year to see a decrease in complaints referred to the Attorney General's Office for discipline . Complaints referred went from eleven in Q4 last year to five this quarter, resulting in a 55% decrease. Much of staff's work during the first three quarters of the last fiscal year concentrated on getting through the backlog of complaints. The decrease in complaints referred may signify that the majority of the backlog has been closed out or referred on already. As a result of a high volume of cases referred to the Attorney General's Office previously in the fiscal year, we are now seeing an increase in Accusations and Statement of Issues filed. Last quarter there were just two Accusations /Statement of Issues filed whereas this quarter five were filed, which represents a 150% increase. The total decisions that became effective have increased by 133% with just three decisions last quarter compared to seven this quarter. The Board continues to see no real consistenc y in its total average days for discipline. Last quarter the Board experienced a great achievement of 488 days for its total average days for discipline. This signified the Board being well under the Department's performance measure target of 540 days. This quarter the total average days for discipline process time was 1,301 days which can be attributed to the older more complex cases closing out. The average process time may become more consistent after all of the older cases close out. On the other hand, due to the Board's small volume of decisions that become effective each quarter, and the wide variance in case types, there may always be inconsistenc y in the total average days. 4 #7d Legislative Update AB 2190 (Salas and Hill) Assembly Bill No. 2190 Passed the Assembly August 24, 2016 ChiefClerk ofthe Assembly Passed the Senate August 19, 2016 Secretary ofthe Senate This bill was received by the Governor this _ day of______ _, 2016, at __o'clock _M. Private Secretary ofthe Governor AB 2190 -2- CHAPTER An act to amend Sections 4927.5, 4928, 4934, 4938, and 4974 of, and to repeal and add Section 4939 of, the Business and Professions Code, relating to healing arts. LEGISLAT IVE COUNSE L'S D IGEST AB 2190, Salas. executive officer: education. Existing law, the Acupuncture Licensure Act, provides for the licensure and regulation of the practice of acupuncture by the Acupuncture Board, within the Department of Consumer Affairs. Existing law authorizes the board, with the approval ofthe Director of Consumer Affairs, to appoint an executive officer who is exempt from civil service. Existing law repeals the provisions establishing the board and authority for it to appoint an executive officer on January 1, 2017. The bill would extend the operation ofthe board and the boards authority to appoint an executive officer until January 1, 2019. Existing law requires, among other things, the completion ofan approved educational and training program in order to be issued a license to practice acupuncture. For purposes ofthe act, beginning January 1, 2017, existing law defines \"approved educational and training program\" as a school or college offering education and training in the practice of an acupuncturist who meets various requirements, including offering curriculum that includes specified hours ofdidactic and laboratory training and supervised clinical instruction. Existing law requires these programs to submit that curriculum to the board and to receive board approval of the curriculum. This bill would provide that any school or college offering education and training in the practice of acupuncture that was approved by the board prior to January 1, 2017, is deemed to have had its curriculum approved by the board if its approval has not been revoked and it has not changed its curriculum since receiving board approval. 95 -3- AB 2190 Beginning January 1, 2017, existing law reg uires the board to establish standards for the approval of educational training and clinical experience received outside the United States. This bill would repeal that board requirement. The bill would instead require an applicant completing education outside of the United States to submit documentation ofhis or her education to a board approved credential evaluation service for evaluation and to have the results ofthe evaluation sent directly from the credential evaluation service to the board. The bill would require the board to examine the received results to determine ifan applicant meets requirements for licensure and, if the evaluated education is not sufficient, would authorize the board to offer the applicant additional education, training, or testing, as specified. The bill would require the board to establish, by regulation, an application process, criteria, and procedures for approval of a credential evaluation service. The bill would require the regulations to, at a minimum , require the credential evaluation service to meet specified requirements. The bill would define, for these purposes, an \"approved credential evaluation service\" as an agency or organization that is approved by the board to evaluate education completed outside the United States and identify the equivalency of that education to education completed within the United States. The bill would also make nonsubstantive changes. The people ofthe State ofCalifornia do enact as.follows : SECTION 1. Section 4927 .5 ofthe Business and Professions Code, as added by Section 2 of Chapter 397 of the Statutes of 2014, is amended to read: 4927.5. a For purposes ofthis chapter, \"approved educational and training program\" means a school or college offering education and training in the practice of an acupuncturist that meets all of the following requirements: l Offers curriculum that includes at least 3,000 hours ofwhich at least 2,050 hours are didactic and laboratory training, and at least 950 hours are supervised clinical instruction. Has submitted that curriculum to the board, and has received board approval of the curriculum. Any school or college offering education and training in the practice of acupuncture that was approved by the board prior to January 1, 2017, has not had its approval revoked, 95 AB 2190 -4- and has not changed its curriculum since receiving board approval, is deemed to have had its curriculum approved by the board for the purposes ofthis section. 2) Has received full institutional approval under Article 6 ( commencing with Section 94885) of Chapter 8 of Part 59 of Division 10 of Title 3 of the Education Code in the field of traditional Asian medicine , or in the case of institutions located outside of this state, approval by the appropriate governmental educational authority using standards equivalent to those ofArticle 6 ( commencing with Section 94885) of Chapter 8 of Part 59 of Division 10 ofTitle 3 ofthe Education Code. 3) Meets any ofthe following: A) Is accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine.

SEC. 2. Section 4928 ofthe Business and Professions Code is amended to read: 4928. a The Acupuncture Board, which consists of seven members, shall enforce and administer this chapter. b This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2019, and as ofthat date is repealed. c Notwithstanding any other law, the repeal of this section renders the board subject to review by the appropriate policy committees ofthe Legislature. SEC. 3.

Action Items for Board: As of Septembe r 13, 2016 (date of Board packet assembly), no action items. This may change depending upon public comments received by the Septembe r 15, 2016 public comment period closure date. Background and discussion: Senate Bill 1246 (Lieu, Chapter 397, Statutes of 2014) is the Board's Sunset Bill from 2014. The provisions of SB 1246 take effect on January 1, 2017. At the November 11, 2015 Board meeting, the Board originally approved proposed regulatory language to address the changes implemented by SB 1246, which: 1. Creates standards for the approval of educational training and clinical experience received outside the United States (proposed CCR Section 1399.433) 2. Sets forth curriculum standards for Board approval of curriculum (proposed CCR section 1399 .434) 3. Repeals obsolete requirements for Board approval of curriculum. (repeal of CCR section 1399.436) 4. Creates a process for approving curriculum (proposed CCR Section 1399.437 ) Staff began work on the proposed SB 1246 rulemaking in early 2016, and received approval from Legal Counsel to file the package with OAL. In April 2016, the Board filed the rulemaking package with OAL, and the public comment period on the proposed regulation began on April 22, 2016. The comment period ended on June 6, 2016, with a public hearing held on June 6, 2016. On August 31, 2016, the Board held a public meeting to review and discuss comments received during the 45-day comment period. The Board adopted responses to the comments , which will be addressed in the Final Statement of Reasons (FSR) for the SB 1246 rulemaking package. 1 BUS NESS, CONSUMER SERVICES, AND HOUSING AGENCY GOVERNOR EDMUND G.

This revised language was reviewed by the Board and then approved on a 6-0 motion w hich was as follows, made by Vice President Zamora and seconded by President Aguinaldo : \"I move to amend the proposed language as staffhas recommended, to approve the modifiedtext for a 15-day comment period and delegate to the Executive Officer, if there are no comments received during the public comment period, the authority to make technical, non-substantive changes as necessary in completing the rulemaking file\". The revised language clarifies the definition of 'physical presence ' requirements of clinic supervisors in approved training programs ; better defines the term 'coursework'; updates a reference to the Clean Needle Technique Manual; and clarifies and updates the 'Requirements for Board Approval of Curriculum ' form. Subsequentl y, the revised regulatory language was released for a 15-day public comment period (beginning September 1, 2016 and ending September 15, 2016) on the Board's website and also mailed out to interested parties. Additional material and responses to the September 1 -September 15th public comment period will be included as an attachment to the packet if needed. If no public comments are received, staff will continue with the rulemaking process by submitting the regulation to DCA and OAL for final approval. It is expected the regulation will be in effect by January 1, 2017. 2 #8 SB 1246 Reg Comment fJVE BRANCHES UNIVERSITY Graduate School ofTraditional Chinese Medicine Santa Cruz Campus 200 Seventh Avenue Santa Cruz California 95062 Tel (831 476-9424 Clinic 831) 476-8211 San Jose Campus 1885 Lundy Suite 108 San Jose California 95131 Tel (408 260-0208 Clinic 408) 260-8868 www.fivebranches_edu Via Email September 14, 2016 Members and Staff State ofCalifornia Acupuncture Board 1747 North Market Blvd, Suite 180 Sacramento, CA 95834 Re: Proposed new clinic training regulation --CCR Section 1399.433 h 4) and CCR Section 1399.434 h 4 Dear California Acupuncture Board President, Members and Executive Director, On behalf ofthe over 100 Five Branches University faculty and our academic leadership, Five Branches University urges the Acupuncture Board to take the time to review and change the proposed new clinic training regulation CCR Section 1399.433 h 4) and CCR Section 1399.434h (4) based on input from the profession and TCM faculty ofCalifornia. The proposed new clinic training regulation seriously undermines safety ofthe patient by ;tudents needling when the students have already been trained in needling. Most importantly, this takes the faculty away from the imperative responsibility ofmeeting with the student to analyze and discuss the diagnosis and treatment plan ofthe patient. By the time students are needling patients, they have had over 250 hours ofdirect acupuncture training, and extensive experience in how to needle every point on the curriculum. During the 250 hours ofacupuncture education and in-class practical training, students have been observed and examined to assure the student is skillful in needling, including CNT, point location, needle angle and needle depth. Students are not allowed to needle patients until they have acquired these skills. As you know, the California standards for acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine education were written over 35 years ago when the acupuncture committee assumed that clinical training would be done in the same structure as in China where acupuncture was practiced in large rooms where the supervisor, patients and students were physically present in the same space. Today, in the U.S. and more and more in China, acupuncture is practiced in private rooms, and the supervisor can only be present with one student and patient. To continue with high quality supervision , faculty need to visit the patient to help in making the correct diagnosis, then meet with the student to discuss and agree on the diagnosis, and acupuncture and herbal formula treatment plan. Faculty normally revisit the patient to observe the accuracy ofthe student's acupuncture. The proposed regulation has the unintended effect oftaking the faculty member away from this fundamental and indispensable aspect ofclinical training -to meet with the student to discuss and agree on the diagnosis , and acupuncture and herbal formula treatment plan -and require that the faculty instead observe the student needling. To require that, \"During the initial 700 hours ofclinical instruction, the student shall remain in the direct line ofsight ofthe clinic supervisor at all times when the patient is being diagnosed and/or treated\" assumes that patients in America are okay being treated in a large, common treatment room, community clinic style. While some patients may accept this, the majority ofpatients want privacy and a private room. As you may know, leading TCM colleges like Finger Lakes School of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine in New York State chose to not undermine the quality oftheir clinical training by following the inferior policies ofthe Acupuncture Board. As a consequence , their program was not approved. California schools in contrast can not afford to not be approved by CAB and have therefore decided to reduce the quality ofclinical training in order to be in compliance -an uncomfortable and regrettable compromise. We have an opportunity to research and understand why CCR Section 1399.434h (4) has received so much resistance from schools and faculty who have been teaching TCM for decades. We hope the Acupuncture Board will take the time to research and understand this issue, and develop a regulation that truly enhances TCM training and protects the people ofCalifornia. In brief, striking, in the view ofour academic leadership and faculty, assure the highest education and clinical training, and would maximize patient safety.

Mr. Zaidman's comments refer to the proposed regulatory text to CCR Sections 1399.433(h) and 1399.434(h ), both of which read as follows: \"(h) Clinical Practice 950 hours The curriculum in clinical practice shall consist of at least 950 hours in clinical instruction, 75% of which shall be in a clinic owned and operated by the school, which includes direct patient contact v.1~0Fo oppFopFioto in the following: (1) Practice Observation (minimum 150 hours)--supervised observation of the clinical practice of acupuncture and Oriental medicine with case presentations and discussion: (2) Diagnosis and evaluation (minimum 275 hours)--the application of Eastern and Western diagnostic procedures in evaluating patients: (3) Supervised practice (minimum 275 hours)--the clinical treatment of patients with acupuncture and oriental medicine treatment modalities listed in the Business and Professions Code Section 4927(d) and 4937(b). (4) During the initial 275 hours of diagnosis, evaluation and clinical practice, the clinic supervisor shall be physically present at all times during the diagnosis and treatment of the patient. Thereafter, for a second period of 275 hours the clinic supervisor shall be physically present at the needling of the patient. During the initial 700 hours of clinical instruction. the student shall remain in the direct line of sight of the clinic supervisor at all times when the patient is being diagnosed and/or treated.

The student shall also consult with the clinic supervisor before and after each treatment. \" Mr. Zaidman feels that \"the proposed new clinic training regulation seriously undermines the quality of clinical education and the safety ofthe patient by forcing faculty to stand by and observe students needling when the students have already been trained in needling. Most importantly , this takes the faculty away from the imperative responsib ility ofmeeting with the student to analyze and discuss the diagnosis and treatment plan of the patient. 1 By the time students are needling patients, they have had over 250 hours ofdirect acupuncture training, and extensive experience in how to needle every point on the curriculum. During the 250 hours ofacupuncture education and in-class practical training, students have been observed and examined to assure the student is skillful in needling, including CNT, point location, needle angle and needle depth.

The proposed changes to CCR Section 1399.433(h) and 1399.434(h) do not alter any of the current clinical requirements that have been in regulation since 2005. The proposed language more clearly defines physical presence as 'line-of-sight' clinical supervision of the student. Needling is a precise and sensitive procedure and there exists a difference between the didactic instruction in the practice and the clinical application of needling. The Acupuncture Board 's primary purpose is to protect the public and reduce the risk of public harm. Therefore, supervision is necessary to ensure that the skills learned didactically continue to develop when transitioning to patient care. Removal of the requirement of a second period of 275 hours that the clinic supervisor shall be physically present would reduce the Board's ability to protect the public by way of thorough training of the student, 2 and may increase the possibility of public harm by requiring less supervised clinical training and instruction for acupuncture students. 3 #9 Consideration and possible action on proposed Amendments to Title 16, CCR Sections 1399.469 -Uniform Standards Related to Substance Abuse SUSI NESS, CONSUM ER SERVICES, ANO HOUSING AGENCY GOVERNOREDMUND G.

Action items for Board: 1. Discussion and recommended approval of revised language for title 16, California Code of Regulations (CCR) Section 1399.469 . If approved, the proposed language would be subject to a 15-day public comment period. If any adverse comments were received during this 15-day public comment period, the regulation package would come before the Board at a future public meeting to address those comments. Absent any adverse comments , the Board may delegate the authority to the Executive Officer to make any technical and non-substanti ve changes and complete the rulemaking for submission to the Office of Administrative Law for final approval. 2. Discussion , review and recommended approval of new 'Uniform Standards Related to Substance Abusing Licensees (Septembe r 2016)' document. 3. Delegation to Executive Officer to continue the regulatory process and grant authority to make non-substantive changes to the regulation and the Disciplinary Guidelines. Suggested Motion: \"I move to approve the proposed regulatory modified text and document for a 15-day public comment period and if there are no adverse comments, to delegate the authority to the executive officer to make any technical and non\u00ad substantive changes that may be required and to adopt the proposed regulatory changes.\" Background and discussion: Originally, this rulemaking package proposed to update the Board's existing 1996 disciplinary guidelines to a new 'Acupuncture Board Disciplinary Guidelines and Conditions of Probation [September 2015]' which includes appropriate provisions of the Uniform Standards formulated by the Department of Consumer Affairs Substance 1 Abuse Coordination Committee (SACC) pursuant to BPC section 315, as set out by Senate Bill 1441 (Ridley-Thomas , 2008). This proposal originally included standard language to be used in disciplinary orders and conditions of probation if the licensee is determined to be a substance-abusing licensee. The Board previously approved the proposed regulatory language and updates to the Disciplinary Guidelines at the September 18, 2015 public board meeting. Staff then commenced the rulemaking process, filing the regulatory package with OAL and then publically releasing the proposed language , Notice to Consumers and Initial Statement of Reasons. The 45-day public comment period began on April 15, 2016 and concluded on May 30, 2016. No public comments were received during the comment period, nor were any received at the public hearing held on May 31 , 2016. Upon further review of the approved language and the updated 2015 Guidelines with Legal Counsel, staff decided to further update the approved regulatory language. The new language is similar to the language approved in 2015, but now clearly articulates when a licensee is a substance-abus ing licensee and when the Uniform Standards apply (after a hearing and the Board, or the ALJ, makes a determination based on the evidence presented at the hearing that the licensee is a substance abusing licensee). Additionally, staff proposes a new, stand-alone document incorporating the Uniform Standards as required by SB 1441. The new 'Uniform Standards for Substance Abusing Licensees (September 2016)' document was removed from the previously approved 2015 Disciplinary Guidelines and as before contains model language that contains the uniform standards developed by SACC in April 2010 as required by SB 1441. Staff believes separating the Uniform Standards from the Disciplinary Guidelines provides the Board, Board staff, and other interested parties more clarity. Additionally, the terms of each document apply in different situations, and thus should be separated . Meanwhile, Staff proposes to remove the proposed document incorporated by reference 'Acupuncture Board Disciplinary Guidelines and Conditions of Probation [September 2015]', from the regulat ion and the 1996 Disciplinary Guidelines will continue to be used. Revisions to the 1996 Disciplinary Guidelines will be completed and presented to the Board for consideration in early 2017. Attachments 1. Updated SB 1441 regulatory language 2.

In 2013, HMS opened the campus clinic. Since HMS has not received training program approval from the Board, the school has not started any students in the clinical internship. However, the site visit team evaluated the clinic for compliance to ensure the curriculum requirements are reflected in the clinical training pursuant to 1399.434 Finding: HMS clinical practicum for intern training did not demonstrate sufficient application of Eastern and Western diagnostic procedures in evaluating patients. Acupuncture Board Training Program Curriculum CCR Section 1399.434(h) (2): \"Diagnosis and evaluation (minimum 250 hours) -the application ofEastern and Western diagnostic procedures in evaluating patients\" HMS Clinic The application of Eastern and Western diagnostic procedures in evaluating patients is not met as evidenced by the following findings: 1) No scale or ruler in treatment rooms. During patient's initial exam, weight and height were not taken. Baseline vital statistics are a necessary part of history and western assessment. 2) Patient mentioned prescription drug use but clinician did not ask the patient to identify the medication they were taking. Clinician prescribed TCM herbal Rx. For teaching and safety drug interactions must be considered. Patient and clinician discussed hypertension although did not ask about medications or suggest herbal Rx. 3) No ICD 9 diagnostic code or CPT coding were recorded or communicated . 21 4) All billing operations are done off site and Diagnostic ICD-9 and CPT coding were not generated by the clinician making these unavailable for student observation . 5) No treatment planning was shared with the patient or observing SME. 6) Follow-up notes did not contain TCM or western assessment , just brief notes as in one case just date of service and \"Shoulder pain\" were written down without any additional treatment details. 7) Several files lacked standard medical terminology , required for follow-up visits. 8) Flow of diagnosis to treatment to procedures not communicated by clinician to front office in a format available for student observation. HMS Corrective Action Taken HMS submitted new medical charts, meeting minutes, and a memo to all supervisors to demonstrate corrective action of findings of clinical non-compliance found during the site visit (See HMS Corrective Action Report). Upon review of the medical charts, meeting minutes, and memo, HMS is in full compliance with CCR\u00a7 1399.434(h)(2). This action brings Health Medicine School in full compliance with CCR Section 1399.434(h )(2).

Pharmacological assessment was not documented and/or discussed. c. Proposed Herbs/Formulas were not listed in all inspected medical charts. Indicated herbs/formulas should be included even if only for teaching purposes. d. Inspected medical charts did not have CPT coding. 2. Western assessments were not applied to some patients: a. Though there is a section for blood pressure on the daily intake form, it was often not performed on every visit. Additionally, the original intake form does not have a section for blood pressure. b. Although some medical charts included pain, range of motion, and sensory, the standard physical examination was not performed for the musculoskeletal case observed. 3. Patient records were not complete: a. Patient charts do not include page numbers. 4. The Clean Needle Technique was not properly applied: a. Prior to Needling , the disinfected area was touched with contaminated hand and therefore re-contaminated. b.

PART VI: PEER REVIEW RECOMMENDATIONS 1. In order to help interns with patient diagnosis, the patient intake forms can list out the Eight Principles for interns to circle. 2. The institution should encourage students to utilize other Eastern diagnosis such as six pathogen ic assessment , six stages, four levels, and San Jiao when appropriate . 3. Diagnost ic analysis should be discussed prior to treatment. PART VII: RECOMMENDATION Protection of the public shall be the highest priority for the Acupuncture Board in exercising its licensing, regulator y, and disciplinary functions. Whenever the protection of the public is inconsistent with other interests sought to be promoted , the protection of the public shall be paramount (California Business and Professions Code, Section 4928.1 ).

Chief complaint was based on patient's subjective statement but not transcribed into objective findings and recorded in standard medical terminology. ii. Standard physical assessments , such as orthopedic, were not conducted for musculoskeletal cases and are missing in the charts. iii. Although there is a field for blood pressure in the initial intake form it was not taken for most initial visits. 1. For training purposes , blood pressure, height and weight must be recorded in follow-up visits. 2. Patient's records were not accurate and complete: a. Although Medical charts noted the treatment number and date on every page, additional pages for intern intake notes were not numbered. b. In one inspected supervisor herbal prescription form, the patient's name, date and dosage were missing. c. In one of the reviewed charts, there is a missing page from the intake form. 3. The Clean Needle Technique was not properly applied: a. During treatment observation, a dabbing motion was used with an alcohol pad to disinfect the treatment area. A wiping motion should always be used. 4. There is no pain scale in the medical chart. In California 's Worker's Compensation system, the two-dimensional pain scale is used, noting the four levels of pain in the categories of severity and frequency. Training Program Corrective Actions Taken: MUIH (MUIH) has submitted new medical charts, meeting minutes, and memos to all supervisors and appropriate parties to demonstrate corrective action of findings of clinical Rev 9/ 16 21 non-compliance found during the site visit (See MUIH Corrective Action Report, and supporting documents). Upon review of the medical charts, meeting minutes, and memo, MUIH is in full compliance with CCR\u00a7 1399.434(h) (2). PART VI: PEER REVIEW RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Needle packages should be kept in the clean field and not in lab coat pockets. 2. It was observed that the Revised Medical Chart is applied in the MOM program but not in the M.Ac. program. This creates inconsistent acupuncture training between the two programs. Using the same form is recommended. Even if the Acupuncture program does not use herbs. PART VII : RECOMMENDATION Protection of the public shall be the highest priority for the Acupuncture Board in exercising its licensing, regulator y, and disciplinary functions. Whenever the protection of the public is inconsistent with other interests sought to be promoted , the protection of the public shall be paramount (California Business and Professions Code, \u00a7 4928.1 ). MUIH's Master of Oriental Medicine California Track acupuncture training program is in full compliance with CCR\u00a7 1399.434.
