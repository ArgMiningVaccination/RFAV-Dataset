But for pregnant women and babies, these healthy fats are especially important. Here's what moms-to-be need to know about omega-3 fatty acids, including how to get enough in your diet and whether it makes sense to take a fish oil supplement. Why are omega-3 fatty acids important during pregnancy? Studies show that omega-3s may offer a number of benefits during pregnancy, including supporting brain and eye development in babies and helping to prevent preterm birth. Omega-3s may even help reduce depressive symptoms in women with perinatal depression, some research suggests. Pregnant women should aim for around 1.4 mg a day of omega-3s. The good news: Your diet is probably already rich in three different types of omega-3 fats. For example, plant foods such as vegetable oils and walnuts contain alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), while fish, fish oils and other marine sources are rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Your prenatal supplement may also contain omega-3 fatty acids. Should you take fish oil during pregnancy? Omega-3 supplements are sometimes recommended, especially if your diet doesn't include fish. Ask your practitioner about pregnancy-safe, mercury-free DHA supplements, and check, too, to see whether your [prenatal vitamin](//www.whattoexpect.com/baby-products/pregnancy/best-prenatal-vitamins-buy-over-counter/) already contains them. Many prenatal vitamins have 200 to 300 mg of DHA already, so it's especially important to speak with your practitioner before adding additional supplements to the mix. If you're not a fan of the fishy aftertaste, you can look for a vegetarian or vegan alternative. Krill oil, from tiny shrimp-like sea creatures, and algae oil, considered a vegetarian source, can supply what you need just as well as fish oil. Avoid cod-liver oil as a source of omega-3s, because it may contain too much vitamin A for pregnant women. Read This Next As with all vitamins and supplements in pregnancy, you should never take anything without first discussing it with your practitioner. Best foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA (the kinds of omega-3s from fish sources) provide the strongest benefits, but your body can convert plant-based ALA into EPA or DHA too. By getting a variety of omega-3 fatty acids in your daily diet before, during and after pregnancy, you'll have enough for yourself and your baby. Here are a few foods that are high in omega-3s, along with tasty ways to eat them. Omega-3 fats EPA and DHA are found in fatty fish, but not all fatty fish should be on the menu if you're pregnant or nursing. Some are too low in omega-3s to be beneficial, while others are potentially too high in toxins like mercury and dioxin. Safer How to prepare it: Whether it's grilled, steamed, poached or roasted, make sure fish is cooked through when you're pregnant. Fatty fish tastes great warm or cold, but stick to simple recipes to let the flavor of the fish be the star. Balance the oiliness of fatty fish with acidic ingredients such as fresh lemon or lime juice, salsa and seasoned vinegar. Add whatever herbs you love \u2014 tarragon, oregano, cilantro and dill all work beautifully. While most nuts contribute healthy fats to your diet, only walnuts and walnut oil contribute omega-3 fatty acids. How to prepare them: While a handful of walnuts makes a quick and satisfying snack, there are plenty of other ways to increase your intake: For breakfast, stir chopped walnuts into oatmeal, add to granola or other cold cereals, or sprinkle over yogurt and sliced fresh fruit. Stir finely chopped walnuts into muffins, quick breads and pancake batters; use them to boost crunch and flavor in green salads; or add finely ground walnuts to bread-crumb mixtures when you're coating chicken and fish. Walnut oil is not generally used for cooking, but it's fabulous in salad dressings or drizzled over grilled or roasted fish, beef or vegetables. If you like its nutty flavor, substitute walnut oil for some (or all) of the vegetable oil or butter called for in baked goods. Soybean products such as tofu, enriched soy milk and edamame can be a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. Just make sure any low-fat varieties of soy products you choose have been enriched with additional omega-3s, since taking the fat out of a food means that the omega-3s \u2014 which are a type of fat \u2014 get cut, too. How to prepare it: Tofu is known for its neutral taste, but the beauty of that blandness is that it allows tofu to take on the flavors of other ingredients. That's why it's a high-protein (and vegetarian) staple in stir-fries, soups and stews. You can bake or broil slabs of tofu with teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, miso, ginger, sesame or curry. Other tasty options: Scramble tofu as you would eggs with veggies and cheese; add tofu to burritos, tacos or chili; or coat a slab with ground walnuts and saut\u00e9 in canola oil for an omega-3 triple threat. Tofu is also perfect for thickening fruit smoothies and shakes. Dark green and leafy veggies like Brussels sprouts, kale, spinach and watercress contain varying amounts of omega-3s, as do parsley and some other fresh herbs. How to prepare them: To prepare fresh Brussels sprouts, trim the stem ends, toss with canola or olive oil, add salt and pepper, then arrange in a baking pan large enough to hold the sprouts in a single layer. Roast in a hot (about 400 degrees F) oven for 20 minutes or until lightly browned and just tender. You can also trim and halve the Brussels sprouts and steam or saut\u00e9 them in canola oil until tender. Spinach and kale taste great steamed or saut\u00e9ed with garlic and a squeeze of lemon juice, or use raw leaves in salads or as the base in a super-omega-3 smoothie. How to prepare them: Try a combo of fortified peanut-butter spread on a fortified tortilla with a glass of fortified milk or juice. Or combine fortified yogurt, milk and peanut butter in a blender with a ripe banana for a luscious omega-3 smoothie. If you have special dietary concerns like a fish or In addition to those above, omega-3 fatty acids like DHA can be found found in other foods you probably already eat, including: Cold-water fish [fish options during pregnancy](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/diet/eating-fish-during-pregnancy/) include wild salmon, sardines, herring and farmed oysters, which are all rich in omega-3s, lower in toxins and readily available. The American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that pregnant women aim for two to three servings (8 to 12 ounces total) a week of a variety of low-mercury fish. If you're not sure whether a particular fish is safe to consume, talk to your health-care provider or check out the [Environmental Defense Fund's Seafood Selector](//seafood.edf.org/guide/best). Walnuts Tofu Leafy green vegetables DHA-fortified or enriched foods [nut allergy](//www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/ask-heidi/nut-allergies.aspx), check the source of omega-3 in the products you use to be sure it's safe for you. Keep in mind, if you're already getting your dose of omega-3s naturally, you don't have to go out of your way to buy fortified or enriched products.
