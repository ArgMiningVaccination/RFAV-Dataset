It can happen naturally or be induced artificially if the ovaries are surgically removed or damaged in some way, such as by radiation or drugs. Menopause is defined as the final menstrual period and is usually confirmed when a woman has missed her period for 12 consecutive months (with no other obvious causes). Because menopause, both natural and artificially induced, causes a decrease in the production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone, this state of a woman's life results in lower levels of those hormones. The 'natural' process happens gradually, over a period of 5 to 10 years. During this time - called perimenopause, the levels of hormones produced by the ovaries will fluctuate. This can lead to longer or shorter menstrual cycles, and/or time between cycles. Not all women experience symptoms - or even the same symptoms in the same way! That is because each woman is unique, and this process will be unique for every woman. Listed below are some of the more common symptoms women can experience during perimenopause: hot flashes (brief but intense heat generally in the upper body) night sweats (and trouble sleeping) bone loss mood swings forgetfulness weight gain fatigue There are many ways to 'treat' menopause symptoms - both conventional and more holistic, natural approaches. Conventionally, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is used to treat common menopausal symptoms by using medications that contain synthetic female hormones to replace the ones the body no longer makes. This type of treatment can be very effective for hot flashes, vaginal dryness and mood issues. However, synthetic hormones create more work for the liver and may deplete the body of certain nutrients - vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, B12, folic acid, vitamin C and magnesium to name a few. Depletion of these nutrients can then lead to other symptoms, condition and diseases. Since the endocrine system and hormones are so intimately connected, HRT treatment can also interfere with proper function of the other endocrine glands including the adrenal glands, pancreas, pituitary, pineal gland, thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, and hypothalamus. Supporting these glands as well as the liver will be important if you choose to use HRT treatment. Additionally, not all women are candidates for this type of treatment so you should always discuss this with your doctor if HRT is appropriate for you. Alternatively, there are other options and choices when dealing with menopause symptoms - including food, supplements, and lifestyle modification opportunities. If you are experiencing some of the symptoms of menopause, certain food choices may make symptoms worse. These food choices include: Packaged/Processed Foods. These foods normally contain added sugar, chemical preservatives, artificial ingredients and other toxins that put stress on the endocrine system, liver and body overall. Many of these foods are also typically high in refined carbohydrates which can contribute to hormone imbalances and blood sugar dysregulation. Choose whole foods over boxed and processed foods. Sugar. Refined sugar also has an impact on your hormonal and digestive systems as well as contributes to weight gain, fatigue and blood sugar problems. Avoid high sugar intake, opting for natural sugars from fruit. Alcohol. Imbibing in your favorite alcoholic beverage, can trigger or increase hot flashes and night sweats because alcohol increases body heat. Additionally, our bodies become more sensitive to the effects of alcohol during menopause and it can negatively affect sleep. Limit or remove alcohol from your diet. Caffeine. Coffee, chocolate, sports and energy drinks, soft drinks and even some pain relievers can contain caffeine. Caffeine may increase the occurrence and severity of hot flashes and night sweats, as well as affect your sleep, just like alcohol. Additionally, it is known to react with the central nervous system and may elevate the intensity and frequency of mood swings. Switch to decaffeinated coffee or herbal teas. Spicy and Hot-Temperature Foods. Soups, hot beverages and spicy foods may all trigger hot flashes and night sweats as well as exacerbate these symptoms. Incorporate cooling foods like cucumber and avocado, as well as eating your food cold or at room temperature if you suffer from hot flashes. Conventional meats and poultry. Conventionally processed meats contain added hormones, pesticides, and other chemicals that can increase inflammation as well as stress the liver and endocrine system. Choose hormone-free, grass-fed, pasture-raised animal proteins when possible. In addition to the tips above, there are other food choices that may help with menopause symptoms. Complex Carbohydrates help regulate blood sugar and mood, support the adrenal glands and may assist with sleep. Fiber - found in nuts, seeds, legumes/beans, ancient grains, fresh veggies and fruit - also helps regulate blood sugar and supports the digestive system. Phytoestrogens are plant estrogens such as isoflavones. You can find phytoestrogens in organic soy, flaxseeds and sprouted legumes. These compounds work in the body to regulate estrogenic effects in the body which may help relieve some symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats. However, if you are a woman with a history of breast cancer, please speak to your doctor because this may not be a good option for you. Water, and plenty of it - at least 8 glasses a day - can help with vaginal dryness and bloating caused by hormone swings as well as flush out toxins from the body. High Quality Protein such as grass-fed, pasture raised meats help stabilize blood sugar and regulate mood swings. Supplements can also be used, however, always choose third-party tested and pharmaceutical grade to ensure the highest quality since supplements are not regulated like pharmaceuticals. Additionally, some supplements interact with certain medications so always speak with your doctor before starting a new supplement. Below is a list of supplements you can speak to your healthcare provider about to see if they could improve your symptoms. Black Cohosh may help with hot flashes and night sweats. Vitex or Chasteberry has been clinically proven to relieve hot flashes. American Ginseng has been shown in some research to help with sleep disturbances and mood swings. Red Clover contains isoflavones that have positive effects in reducing symptoms related to estrogen loss \u2014 such as hot flashes, trouble sleeping, weight gain, and bone loss. Wild Yam has compounds similar to estrogen and progesterone and has been used as an alternative for hormone therapy. Other lifestyle choices that may help with the management of menopause symptoms include keeping a positive attitude and reducing and managing stress. Some effective ways to reduce or relieve stress include: Exercise Acupuncture Aromatherapy Spending time in nature Fostering close relationships Volunteering Dedicating time to spiritual practices, including meditation When women are able to make themselves a priority (even 15 minutes a day), dramatic changes can occur. Remember that menopause is a unique and very personal experience, and although it ends a woman's childbearing years, it can also be an invigorating, expansive time for personal growth. It is the perfect opportunity to take the time to take care of "}
