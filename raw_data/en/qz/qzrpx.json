Recently, Orange County diabetes facility Next Advanced Medicine, led by diabetes chiropractor physician Dr. Candice McCowin, participated alongside nearly 40 individual Doctors of Chiropractic in a case series of over 700 type 2 diabetic cases that had matriculated through their clinical model.

Many type 2 diabetics are increasingly frustrated with the poor outcomes that are often associated with the traditional drug-therapy approach. As their situation worsens over time, many type 2 diabetics complain that their provider almost always reaches for more prescription drugs-- never attempting to get to the route of the disease process. The case study analyzed many areas of improvement to include standard bio-markers from blood labs, weight loss, and medication reductions and eliminations. The results, which are quite shocking, are below: - Average reduction in HA1C: 18 percentage points - Average reduction in weight: 24 lbs. (In most cases this was done with no exercise) - Percentage of participants that reduced their oral medication: 84% of participants - Percentage of participants that experienced a reduction of prescribed insulin: 100% of participants - Percentage of patients that got off of all oral medication: 74% of participant - Percentage of patients that no longer required insulin: 50% of participants - Percentage of patients achieving non-diabetic status: 45% of participants It is becoming clearer that the scientific literature is accurate, and it certainly appears Type 2 Diabetes is reversible, Dr. McCowin noted. She and her clinical staff look forward to helping Type 2 diabetics in Orange County understand that their condition is often not permanent and could be put into remission.
