Disclai mer COVID -19 vaccine is recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health for healthcare workers to protect our patients, students, faculty, staff, and families from COVID -19 and its associated complications, including death UCR's objective is to ensure the safety of employees and patients Updated information/guidelines will be communicated to staff 2What is the best response during a pandemic? 3Follow all CDC and the California Department of Public Health recommendations and guidance Wear a mask and physically distance to reduce your chance of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) Get a vaccine if one is availableWhy is a vaccine important during a pandemic? 4COVID-19 Trainin g Purpose ThepurposeofthistrainingistoprovideCOVID end ofthistraining, the learner willbe able to: Describe how the body fights an infection Explain how the COVID -19 vaccines were created and how they work Describe safety measures in place for the COVID -19 vaccines Identify the process for receiving or declining the COVID -19 vaccine State safety precautions a person takes after getting the COVID -19 vaccine 6How does the body fight an infection? 7Immune Response 8Germs invade our bodies -they attack and multiply causing an infection and illness The immune system protects the body against infection and illness by recognizing germs (bacteria, virus) and responding by creating proteins called antibodies Antibodies fight infection, help a person recover, and prevent a person from becoming ill in the future How were the COVID -19 vaccines created? 9Clinical Trials 10Clinical trials test medical interventions Drugs, vaccines, or procedures are tested in human volunteers to assess usefulness, efficacy, and safety Clinical trials for COVID -19 vaccines and treatments compare active medications with placebos These trials, which included people at high risk for COVID -19, are specifically designed to identify any common side effects or other safety concerns Clinical trials included people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds and the vaccine was found to be effective and safe for all participants Clinical trials in the United States have four phasesFour Phases of Clinical Trials -FDA 11Phase 1 Involves a smaller number of volunteers and looks for serious adverse eventsPhase 2 Focuses on efficacy and short -term adverse eventsPhase 3 Gathers information on dosage, efficacy, and safety in a large number of volunteersPhase 4 Medication is approved for distribution to study real-life reactions, effectiveness and long - term risks, and rare adverse eventsClinical Trial Demographic Data 12Pfizer/ BioNTech Moderna Johnson & Johnson 43,448 Hispanic 17% African 3.5% Asian 8%Native American (CDC) 13COVID -19 vaccines are being held to the same rigorous safety and effectiveness standards as all other types of vaccines in the U.S. Many strict protections help ensure that COVID -19 vaccines are safe Rigorous, multi -stage testing process, including large (phase III) trials involve tens of thousands of people Only COVID -19 vaccines that meet these standards are made available in the United States, by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval or emergency use authorizationVaccine Development: Vaccines Types 14Inactivated or Weakened Virus Use a form of virus that been inactivated or weakened so it doesn't cause disease but still generates an immune responseProtein Based Use harmless fragments of proteins or protein shells that mimic the virus to safely generate an immune responseViral Vector Use a virus that has been genetically engineered so that it can't cause disease, but produces proteins to safely generate an immune response RNA and DNA A cutting -edge approach that uses genetically engineered RNA or DNA to generate a protein that itself safely prompts an immune responseCOVID -19 Vaccine Development 15Through Operation Warp Speed A partnership between the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Defense (DOD) To develop, make, and distribute millions of vaccine doses as quickly as possible At the same time make sure vaccines are safe and that they work COVID -19 Vaccine Emergency Use 16Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) This is a way for the FDA to make vaccines and treatments available to the public under emergency circumstances such as a pandemic, before those interventions have undergone the lengthy formal review process FDA evaluates the options very quickly by using the evidence that is available and carefully balances any known or potential risks of the product with any known or potential benefits to the public of making them available during the emergency COVID -19 Vaccine Distribution 17LA County and the CDC have recommended a tiered approach to determine the order in which the vaccine will be distributed Vaccines are prioritized in the following way: Health care workers and long-term care facility residentsPeople age 65 and olderGeneral public (those not in groups listed)Workers in essential and critical industriesPeople age 16-64 with underlying health conditionsHow do the COVID -19 vaccines work? 18How Vaccines Work 19Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to make antibodies: Helping our body develop immunity to a virus without getting an illness Training the immune system to recognize and fight viruses or bacteria 20How COVID -19 Vaccines Work COVID -19 vaccines give instructions for our cells to make a harmless piece of what is called the \"spike protein\" found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID -19. COVID -19 vaccines are given in a muscle (i.e. upper arm). Once the instructions are inside the cells, the cells make the spike protein. Our immune system recognizes that the protein doesn't belong there and builds an immune response by making antibodies. This is similar to what happens in a natural COVID -19 infection. At the end of the process, our bodies learn how to protect against future infection.COVID -19 Vaccine Facts (CDC) 21The vaccines cannot give someone COVID -19 The vaccines do not use the live virus that causes COVID -19 The vaccines do not affect or interact with our DNA in any wayHow the COVID -19 Vaccines Work 22The COVID -19 vaccine helps our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID -19 without us having to get the illness Teaches our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID -19 Helps the immune system to produce antibodies that will remember how to fight that virus in the future and protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies Antibody Human cellSARS -CoV-2Types of COVID -19 Vaccines 23There are currently two types of COVID -19 Vaccines approved under Emergency Use Authorization: Messenger RNA (mRNA) Vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) Viral Vector Vaccine (Johnson & Johnson) The types of vaccines will be reviewed in detail What is an mRNA Vaccine 24Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) A new type of vaccine Gives instructions for our cells to make a protein or piece of a protein to trigger an immune response to produce antibodies and protect from infection mRNA vaccine does not alter or modify a person's genetic makeup (DNA) Pfizer Vaccine mRNA vaccine 2 doses, 21 days apart One vial = 6 doses Ultra low temp storage ( -80C or -112F) Vaccine shelf -life 6 months @ -80C 5 days refrigerated (not reconstituted) 6 hours room temp (reconstituted)Moderna Vaccine mRNA vaccine 2 doses, 28 days apart One vial = 10 doses -20C or -4F storage Vaccine shelf -life 7 days refrigerated 2 hours room temp 6 hours (once vial is first punctured) 25What is the difference -mRNA COVID -19 Vaccines? Study of mRNA Vaccines (CDC) 26Researchers have been studying and working with mRNA vaccines for decades in the study of flu, Zika, rabies, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) As soon as information about the virus that causes COVID -19 was available, scientists began designing the mRNA instructions for cells to build the unique spike protein into an mRNA vaccine mRNA vaccines can be developed in a lab with readily available materials, thus they can be developed faster than other traditional vaccinesWhat is a Viral Vector Vaccine 27A harmless virus that cannot cause infection in humans is modified A gene for a portion of the target virus is inserted into the harmless virus to deliver instructions to the body's cells to make antibodies The body then makes antibodies for the target virus Harmless virus Gene for portion of target virus Source for picture: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/johnson - johnson -covid -19-vaccine.htmlJohnson & Johnson COVID -19 Vaccine 28The Johnson & Johnson COVID -19 vaccine utilizes viral vector technology The gene for the SARS -CoV-2 spike protein is placed inside a harmless cold virus to instruct the body to make antibodies The genetic material for the SARS -CoV-2 virus spike protein used in the COVID -19 vaccine does not integrate into a person's DNA It is a 1 -dose vaccine and can be stored at regular refrigeration temperaturesStudy of Viral Vector Technology 29Scientists began creating viral vectors in the 1790s Viral vectors are used for vaccines, gene therapy and cancer treatment There are viral vector vaccines for influenza, measles virus, VSV and adenovirus (the common cold) The Ebola vaccine is also a viral vector vaccine that has been used to respond to the recent Ebola outbreaksContraindications to Receiving any COVID -19 Vaccine 30Contraindications (reasons notto get the vaccine) Severe allergic reaction to any component of the vaccine Life-threatening reaction to any previous vaccine If you have any of the above, you will be advised to decline, but you should check with your primary care provider If you have any current health conditions and have questions about whether you should receive the vaccine or not, please discuss the vaccine with your primary care providerReceiving COVID -19 Vaccine with Prior COVID -19 Infection 31There is not enough information currently available to say if or for how long after infection someone is protected from getting COVID - 19 again, called natural immunity Early evidence suggests natural immunity from COVID -19 may not last very long Potentially 90 days from previous COVID19 infection 32What safety measures are in place for the COVID -19 vaccine? Vaccine Safety Monitoring Measures 33Vaccine Safety Monitoring There are many safety monitoring systems to watch for adverse events after a vaccine is authorized and approved for use This monitoring is critical to help ensure that the benefits continue to outweigh the risks for people who receive vaccines If an unexpected adverse event is seen, experts quickly study it further to assess whether it is a true safety concern Experts will then decide whether changes are needed in vaccine recommendations Vaccine Safety Monitoring Systems 34CDC uses 3 systems to monitor vaccine safety: Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS): an early warning system, managed by CDC and FDA, to monitor vaccine safety Anyone can submit a report for any health problems that happen after vaccination i.e. healthcare staff, general public Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD): a collaboration between CDC and healthcare organizations that conduct vaccine safety monitoring Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA): a CDC and several medical research centers partnership to conduct clinical research Vaccine Safety Monitoring (V -SAFE) 35Vaccine Safety Assessment A smartphone -based text, text -to-web survey, and email -to-web survey active surveillance program for vaccine recipients Uses contact information (phone numbers) at the registration process Conducts health checks via text messages and email Daily for first week post -vaccination Weekly thereafter for 6 weeks post -vaccination What you should know about receiving or declining the COVID - 19 vaccine? 36COVID -19 Vaccination Program 37University of California SARS -CoV-2 Vaccination Program Policy All UC personnel and trainees must participate in the SARS -CoV-2 Vaccination Program by consenting to or declining vaccination Staff will provide consent for receiving vaccine at the required intervals or sign a vaccination declination statement On-Site Vaccination : receives vaccine at UCR Off-Site Vaccination : provides written documentation of the location vaccine was received i.e. private health care provider's office, local pharmacy, etc. Declination : formally declining the vaccine by completing and signing the Vaccine Declination Statement Receiving COVID -19 Vaccine 38Consent -you will have the chance to read the FDA Fact Sheet for the vaccine and ask questions Risks and benefits of the COVID -19 vaccine will be explained Number of doses and scheduling Depending on the COVID -19 vaccine, it may be one dose or two doses If you are receiving a two dose vaccine at UCR Health, you will receive an email through MyChart after your first dose to schedule your second dose Cannot mix vaccinations or choose the vaccine that you wantReceiving COVID -Vaccine -How long will it last? 39Additional research is needed to know the long -term protection of COVID -19 vaccine Clinical studies have so far followed patients for a few months after vaccination Patients in the studies will eventually be followed for two years. Available data suggest that most people who recover from COVID - 19 develop an immune response that provides at least some protection against reinfection for the length of time the study has been doneDeclining COVID -19 Vaccine 40The risks associated with declining the COVID -19 vaccine include: If I contract COVID -19, I can shed the virus for several days before any symptoms appear. During the time I shed the virus, I can transmit it to patients, students, faculty, staff and family. If I contract COVID -19, even if my symptoms are mild or non -existent, I can spread the disease to others. Symptoms that are mild or non - existent in me, can cause serious illness and death in others. If I contract COVID -19, it could have life -threatening consequences for my health and the health of everyone with whom I have contact, including patients, students, faculty, staff and family.41What happens after I receive the COVID -19 vaccine? After Receiving the COVID -19 Vaccine 42Continue to follow all current CDC guidelines and precautions, including guidance on: Hand hygiene Physical distancing Universal masking Eye protection All appropriate PPE guidelines in clinical care areasExpected Vaccine Reactions 43COVID -19 vaccines may produce side effects after vaccination Side effects may include: Pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, mild fever, nausea No significant safety concerns were identified in the clinical trials Side effects are unlikely to appear more than 8 weeks after vaccination For vaccines that require two doses, there may be more side effects after the second doseFollow -up (V -SAFE) 44Follow -up will be conducted with all people who receive the COVID -19 vaccine that sign up for V -SAFE References 45Cohen, S.
