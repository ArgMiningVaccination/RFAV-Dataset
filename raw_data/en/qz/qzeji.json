However, high-dose chemotherapy simultaneously causes damage to healthy tissues that frequently result in severe complications that lead to hospitalization and can be life threatening. These severe complications involve the blood, immune, gastro-intestinal systems, and other vital organs. The purpose of this study is to determine if experimental therapy AB-205 (study drug) can prevent or reduce the occurrence and duration of the severe chemotherapy related complications when compared to placebo in patients with lymphoma undergoing treatment with high-dose chemotherapy and blood stem cell transplantation. All patients, whether treated with AB-205 or placebo, will receive standard preventive and supportive care therapies.

White blood cells are part of the immune system and NK cells are a type of white blood cell that are known to kill cancer cells. This clinical trial will enroll patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma of B-cell origin and is conducted in two phases. The primary objectives of Phase 1 are as follows: 1) to evaluate the safety of AB-101 given alone or in combination with rituximab (including the DLBCL specific cohort) or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab; 2) to evaluate the potential clinical activity of AB-101 when given in combination with rituximab or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab (combination cohorts only); and 3) to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The primary objective of Phase 2 is to determine whether AB-101 in combination with rituximab or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab has anti-cancer activity in patients. Patients will be assigned to receive either AB-101 alone as monotherapy, in combination with rituximab (including DLBCL specific cohort) or in combination with bendamustine and rituximab. All patients will receive at least 1 treatment cycle of AB-101, followed by scheduled assessments of overall health and tumor response. Patients receiving AB-101 in combination with rituximab may receive up to 3 additional cycles of treatment. Patients receiving AB-101 in combination with bendamustine and rituximab may receive up to 5 additional cycles of treatment. Patients enrolled into the DLBCL specific cohort receiving AB-101 in combination with rituximab may receive up to 3 cycles of treatment.

Brentuximab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, brentuximab, linked to a toxic agent called vedotin. Brentuximab attaches to cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. The addition of nivolumab or brentuximab vedotin to combination chemotherapy may shrink the cancer or extend the time without disease symptoms coming back. La Jolla, California and other locations [Lenalidomide and Blinatumomab for the Treatment of Relapsed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT02568553) Sorry, in progress, not accepting new patients This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of lenalidomide and blinatumomab when given together in treating patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed). Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Blinatumomab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. La Jolla, California and other locations [NKTR-255 vs Placebo Following CD19-directed CAR-T Therapy in Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Large B-cell Lymphoma](https://clinicaltrials.ucsd.edu/trial/NCT05664217) Sorry, not currently recruiting here This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of NKTR-255 following CD19-directed chimeric antigen (CAR)-T cell therapy in refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). NKTR-255 is an receptor agonist designed to boost the immune system's natural ability to fight cancer. T cells are infection fighting blood cells that can kill tumor cells. Chimeric antigen (CAR)-T cell product consists of genetically engineered T-cells, modified to recognize CD19, a protein on the surface of cancer cells. These CD19-specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill CD19-positive cancer cells. Giving NKTR-255 following the treatment with CD19 CAR-T cell therapy may work better in treating large B-cell lymphoma than either drug alone.
