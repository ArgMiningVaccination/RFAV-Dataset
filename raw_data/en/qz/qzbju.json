The purported One True Cure promoted by dentist Larry Lytle was so-called \"universal healing energy\" supposedly offered through his low-level laser devices. He advertised them \"for the treatment of any unknown condition.\" Toby McAdam marketed herbal concoctions for treating cancer and other serious diseases. He sold oils, salves, tonics, tinctures, and oral cleansing products containing caustic bloodroot. Robert O. Young, who misrepresented himself as a highly educated, distinguished scientist, promoted various bizarre treatments as well as the false notion that health depends primarily on the degree of acidity or alkalinity of body fluids. He marketed dietary modification and supplements for pH optimization. The One True Cure of Leilani and Dale Neuman, a married couple who founded a Pentecostal ministry in rural Wisconsin, continues to be prayer, even after observing a tragic failure of it to be therapeutic for a medically manageable condition. Another One True Cure promoter told Hongoltz-Hetling what he claimed to have revealed to only a select group of people: that he was an ancient god from the Andromeda galaxy currently living in the body of a straight, white, male human named Jim Humble. Hongoltz-Hetling refers to him as \"the alien in Humble's skin.\" I chuckled when he really, I can't prove that he isn't.\" Humble's One True Cure was a bleach solution originally known as Humble's Health Drink and eventually known as Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS). Humble promoted MMS in his online book The Miracle Mineral Supplement of the 21st Century. He eventually teamed up with Mark Grenon, an ardent Bible student and preacher who had set up a residential mission in the Dominican Republic. In 2011, they created the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing with Humble as cofounding archbishop and Grenon as cofounding bishop. They denied that Genesis II sold MMS\u2014as they knew doing so would run afoul of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But they accepted twenty-dollar \"donations\" and gave donors four-ounce bottles of the church's signature miracle sacramental cleansing water. The \"church\" also hosted seminars, charging attendees $450 to become Genesis II health ministers, and set up MMS-focused retreats at the MMS \"Restoration Center\" in Santa Marta, Colombia. Genesis II continued to operate even after Humble left it in 2015 over a disagreement with Grenon. Alicja Kolyszko became the major popularizer in the United States of hirudotherapy (leech therapy). Hongoltz-Hetling writes that in the late 1990s, she referred to herself as Dr. A-Leech-A in online advertisements, personally treated patients wherever she went, and received favorable mainstream media attention. Although evidence is lacking to support Kolysko's belief that hirudotherapy is effective against a variety of serious health problems, in 2004 the FDA permitted the sale of one leech species as a medical device for promoting blood flow following cosmetic and reconstructive surgeries. In 2011, Kolysko founded the Academy of Hirudotherapy, which provides hirudotherapy training and a certification process recognized by various international organizations. According to Hongoltz-Hetling: Unlike the other One True Cure practitioners I spoke with, Alicja has accepted the responsibility of ensuring that her operation is within the scope of the law. The academy is powered by a curriculum designed to keep patients safe and practitioners out of regulatory trouble. To do this, Alicja drew on her experience working as a dialysis technician within the US health care system. She is well versed in how to create and maintain a sterile working environment, and she studied applicable regulations in various states to make sure she was legal (214). It doesn't appear Kolyszko ever ran afoul of law enforcement authorities as the other featured panacea promoters did. Nevertheless, I was disappointed that Hongoltz-Hetling didn't discuss her practice of offering \"Alternative Biocure with Medical Leeches,\" the murky description on her website of her qualifications (including that\u2014as of this writing\u2014she was finishing her education as a doctor of naturopathic medicine, had \"pending\" MS/PhD degrees in gerontology from the University of Southern California, \"pending\" BS/MS degrees in nursing/health care management from Columbia University, lists various \"alternative\" practitioner certifications, uses the prefix \"Dr.\" with her name, and uses unusual suffixes with her name, including \"DHT\")\u2014not to mention her promotional hype. The About section of Kolyszko's website declares: A pleasant and welcoming atmosphere is created by Kolyszko wherever she provides leech-therapy. Hirudotherapy, the treatment of many ailments, is used to improve conditions, she explains, and plays a role in optimum health by retaining general wellness. Kolyszko assists in detoxification, rejuvenation and blood purification process, using medicinal leeches. Nevertheless, Hongoltz-Hetling's book is a significant contribution to the literature on the promotion of what Hongoltz-Hetling calls \"science-lite health care.\" It addresses how fringe medicine is thriving and harming American society. It blames the problem on the dysfunctional American health care system, the lax regulatory environment for dietary supplements, how ill-equipped the FDA is to deal with panacea promoters, flawed government institutions, and the misguided medical freedom movement. Hongoltz-Hetling considers potential solutions, but he sees no short-term fix. Based on his research, he concludes \"there is no One True Cure for the One True Cure.\" The book's thirty-nine-page bibliography is indicative of substantial investigative efforts. Unfortunately, the book has no citations within the text, no notes section, and no index; it's less useful for health care scholars to rely on than it should be. Hongoltz-Hetling's discussions of interviews with a victim of a panacea promoter and a participant in a faith healing training session are fascinating and illuminating. I'm impressed that he gained enough trust of panacea promoters for them to share intimate details of their lives with him in interviews. He tells their remarkable stories with a well-balanced combination of empathy, wit, and snark. I strongly recommend If It Sounds Like a Quack... for readers who appreciate exceptional storytelling, black comedy, and healthy skepticism. I think many people who are drawn to the fringes of American medicine would like it too. "}
