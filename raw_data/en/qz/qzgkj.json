Volu ntary disclosure arising from self-evaluation - presum ption against imposition of adm inistrative or civil penalties. (1) For the purposes of this section, a disclosure of information by a person or entity to any division or agency within the department of public health and environment regarding any information related to an environmental law is voluntary if all of the following are true: (a) The disclosure is made promptly after knowledg e of the information disclosed is obtained by the person or entity ; (b) The disclosure arises out of a voluntary self-evaluation; (c) The person or entity making the disclosure initiates the appropriate effort to achieve Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 20compliance, pursues compliance with due diligence, and corrects the noncompliance within two years after the completion of the voluntary self-evaluation. Where such evidence shows the noncompliance is the failure to obtain a permit, appropriate efforts to correct the noncompliance may be demonstrated by the submittal of a complete permit application within a reasonable time. (d) The person or entity making the disclosure cooperates with the appropriate division or agency in the department of public health and environment regarding investig ation of the issues identified in the disclosure. (2) F or the purposes of parag raph (c) of subsection (1) of this section, upon application to and at the discretion of the department of public health and environment, the time period within which the noncompliance is required to be corrected may be extended if it is not practicable to correct the noncom pliance within the two-y ear period. A request for a de novo review of the decision of the department of public health and environment may be made to the appropriate district court or administrative law judg e. (3) I f a person or entity is required to make a disclosure to a division or agency within the department of public health and environment under a specific permit condition or under an order issued by the division or agency, then the disclosure is not voluntary with respect to that division or ag ency. (4) If any person or entity makes a voluntary disclosure of an environmental violation to a division or agency within the department of public health and environment, then there is a rebuttable presumption that the disclosure is voluntary and therefore the person or entity is immune from any administrative and civil penalties associated with the issues discl osed and is immune from any criminal penalties for negligent acts associated with the issues disclosed. The person or entity shall provide information supporting its claim that the disclosure is voluntary at the time that the disclosure is made to the division or ag ency. (5) To rebut the presumption that a disclosure is voluntary , the appropriate division or agency shall show to the satisfaction of the respective commission in the department of public health and environment or the state board of health, if no respective commission exists, that the disclosure was not voluntary based upon the factors set forth in subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section. A decision by the commission or the state board of health, whichever is appro priate, regarding the voluntary nature of a disclosure is final agency action. The division or agency may not include any administrative or civil penalty or fine or any criminal penalty or fine for neg ligent acts in a notice of violation or in a cease-and-desist order on any underly ing environmental violation that is alleg ed absent a finding by the respective commission or the state board of health that the division or agency has rebutted the presumption of voluntariness of the disclosure. The burden to rebut the presumption of voluntariness is on the division or ag ency. (6) The elimination of administrative, civil, or criminal penalties under this section does not apply if a person or entity has been found by a court or administrative law judge to have committed serious violations that constitute a pattern of continuous or repeated violations of environmental laws, rules, regulations, permi t conditions, settlement agreements, or orders on consent and that were due to separate and distinct event s giving rise to the violations, within the three-y ear period prior to the date of the disclosure. Such a pattern of continuous or repeated violations may also be demonstrated by multiple settlement agreements related to substantially the same alleg ed violations concerning serious instances of noncompliance with environm ental Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 21laws that occurred within the three-y ear period immediately prior to the date of the voluntary disclosure. (7) Except as specifically provided in this section, this section does not affect any authority the department of public health and envir onment has to require any action associated with the information disclosed in any voluntary disclosure of an environmental violation. (8) Unless the contex t otherwise requires, the definition s contained in section 13-25- 126.5 (2), C.R.S., apply to this section. (9) This section applies to voluntary disclosures that are made and voluntary self- evaluations that are performed on or after J une 1, 1994. 25-1-114.6. Implementation of environm ental self-audit law - pilot project - legislative declar ation. (1) (a) The general assembly hereby finds and determines that, in order to encourag e the regulated community to utiliz e the environmental self-audit provisions contained in this section and sections 25-1-114.5, 13-25-126.5, and 13-90-107 (1) (j), C.R.S., a pilot project is established. The general assembly hereby declares that the purpose of the environmental self-audit provisions contained in this section and sections 25-1-114.5, 13-25- 126.5, and 13-90- 107 (1) (j), C.R.S., is to encourag e the regulated community to voluntarily ident ify environmental concerns and to address them expeditiously without fear of enforcement action by regulatory agencies. The general assembly recog nizes that, due to concerns with the environmental self-audit provisions, the United States environmental protection agency has, in the past, taken direc t action against entities in the regulated community that have made disclosures under the environmental self-audit provisions. The general assembly further declares that the pilot project enacted by this section is inten ded to allow entities to proceed under the environmental self-audit provisions with assurance that, if any such entity complies with such environmental self-audit provisions, the United States environmental protection agency will forego any enforcement action based on the disclosures made and addressed under the environmental self-audit pilot project. (b) The general assembly further recogn izes that, under the pilot project enacted by this section, the department of public health and environment will have discretion to consider certain factors in assessing a regulated entity 's eligibility for penalty immunity under the environmental laws.

Emergency contraception - definitions. (1) For purposes of this section, unless the contex t otherwise requires: (a) \"Emerg ency contracept ion\" means a drug approved by the federal food and drug administration that prevents pregnancy after sexual intercourse, including but not limited to oral contraceptive pills; except that \"emerg ency contraception\" shall not include RU-486, mifepristone, or any other drug or device that induces a medical abortion. Nothing in section 2-4- 401 (1.5), C.R.S., shall be construed to amen d or alter the definition of \"emerg ency contraception\" . (b) \"Sexual assault survivor \" shall have the same meaning as \"victim\" as defined in section 18-3-401 (7), C.R.S.

(5) The general assembly encourag es health care facilities to provide training to emerg ency room staff concerning the efficacy of emergency contraception and the time-sensitive Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 156nature of drug . (6) Because emerg ency contraception is time-sensitive and a sexual assault survivor may seek information on or direct acces s to emerg ency contraception to prevent an unintended pregnancy resulti ng from the assault instead of or prior to seeking hospital treatment, it is critical that sexual assault survivors have accurate information about the availability and use of emerg ency contraception. Therefore, the g eneral assembly encourag es: (a) Entities offering victim assistance or counseling and rape crisis hotlines to include information concerning the availability and use of emerg ency contraception; and (b) Licensed or registered pharmacies in the state of Colorado to distribute information concerning the availability and use of emerg ency contraception. 25-3-111.

This part 7 shall be known and may be cited as the \"Statewide Trauma Care Sy stem Act\" . 25-3.5-702. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly hereby finds and declares that trauma is the greatest single cause of death and disability in Colorado for persons under the age of forty -five years and that trauma care is a unique type of emerg ency medical service. (2) The general assembly further finds that a trauma system task force made up of various emerg ency health and trauma care entities submitted a report to the general assembly in 1993 indicating a compelling need to develop and implement a statewide trauma care system in order to assure that appropriate resources are available to trauma victims from the point of injury throug h rehabilitative care. In addition, a statewide system is essential to provide Colorado residents and visitors with a greater probability of surviving a life-th reatening injury and to reduce trauma-related morbidity and mortality in this state. (3) The general assembly , therefore, declares that it is necessary to enact legislation directing the board of health to adopt rules that govern the implementation and oversig ht of the trauma care system. The general assembly further declares that to ensure the availability and coordinatio n of resources necessary to provide essential care, it is necessary to enact legislation that directs the department of public health and environment to collaborate with ex isting agencies and organizations, including governing bodies for counties and cities and counties, in implementing and monitoring a statewide trauma care sy stem. 25-3.5-703.

PART 8 TOB ACCO EDUCATI ON, PREVENTI ON, AND CESSATI ON PROGRAMS Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 21225-3.5-801. Short title. This part 8 shall be known and may be cited as the \"Tobacco Education, Prevention, and Cessation Act\" . 25-3.5-802. Legislative declaration. (1) The g eneral assembly hereby finds that: (a) The use of all types of tobacco products, including smokeless tobacco, results in a high incidence of addiction, disease, illness, and death; (b) Persons who begin using and become addicted to tobacco products in their youth often face a lifetime of strug gle and recurring illness in coping with and attempting to overcome addiction to tobacco products; (c) Experimentation with tobacco products by youth is often a first step toward more serious drug experimentatio n and creates a greater likelihood that the youth who experiment with tobacco will at some point be addicted to even more harmful substances; (d) Implem entation of aggressive tobacco and substance abuse prevention, education, and cessation programs for school-ag e children is necessary to assist young people in avoiding and ending tobacco use; (e) School districts, school s, and other entities that provide tobacco and substance abuse prevention, education, and cessation progr ams for school-ag e children should reach out to parents and encourag e them to participate, either as students or role models, in implementing said programs. (2) The general assembly hereby finds that persons with mental illness are more likely to abuse tobacco products than any other segment of society . The general assembly further finds that the unusually heavy pattern of tobacco abuse engaged in by persons with mental illness requires special treatment strateg ies that are not provided by other alcohol, drug, or tobacco abuse programs. It is therefore the general assembly 's intent that the programs funded pursuant to this part 8 inclu de comprehensive programs to prevent and treat tobacco addiction among persons with mental illness. (3) The g eneral assembly also finds that: (a) Each year, thousands of people in this state die from diseases that have been clinically proven to be caused by or directly related to tobacco use; (b) Once a person starts using tobac co, he or she usually becomes addicted to the nicotine contained in the tobac co, which makes it terribly difficult for the person to quit using tobacco even when the person is aware of the significant health risks that accompany tobacco use; (c) Studies show that a child is at a substantially greater risk of starting to use tobacco if the child's parents or older sibling s use tobacco. Therefore, reducing tobacco use by adults may significantly reduce the risk that children will beg in using tobacco. (d) Annual direct medical costs from tobac co use in Colorado currently exceed one billion dollars; (e) Comprehensive tobacco education, prevention, and cessation programs may result in millions of dollars in saving s to the state and individual residents of the state for g enerations.

(2) No person who administers a vaccine which is required under the provisions of this part 9 to an infant or child whose age is greater than twenty days shall be held liable for injuries sustained pursuant to such vaccine if: (a) The vaccine was administered using generally accepted clinical methods; (b) The vaccine was administered according to the schedule of immuniz ation as published by the communicable disease control administration of the federal g overnment; and Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 250(c) There were no clinical symptoms nor clinical history present under which prudent health care professionals would not have administered such vaccine. (3) An action shall not be maintained for a vaccine-related injury or death until action for compensation for such alleg ed injury has been exhausted under the terms of the \"National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986\", 42 U.S.C. secs. 300aa-10 to 300aa-33, as such law is from time to time amended.

Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 25225-4-1004. New born screening. (1) (a) Repealed. (b) On or after April 1, 1989, all infants born in the state of Colorado shall be tested for the following conditions: and such other conditions as the board of health may determine meet the criteria set forth in parag raph (c) of this subsection (1). Appropriate specimens for such testing shall be forwar ded by the hospital in which the child is born to the laboratory operated or desig nated by the department of public health and environment for such purposes. The physician, nurse, midwife, or other health professio nal attending a birth outside a hospital shall be responsible for the collection and forwarding of such specimens. The results of the testing shall be forwarded directly to the physician or other primary health care provider for the provision of such information to the parent or parents of the child. The results of any testing or follow-up testing pursuant to section 25-4-1004.5 may be sent to the immuniz ation tracking system authoriz ed by section 25-4-2403 and acces sed by the physician or other primary health care provider. The state board of health may discontinue testing for any condition listed in this parag raph (b) if, upon consid eration of criteria set forth in parag raph (c) of this subsection (1), the board finds that the public health is better served by not testing infants for that condition. (c) The board of health shall use the following criteria to determine whether or not to test infants for conditions which are not specifically enumerated in this subsection (1): (I) The condition for which the test is desig ned presents a significant dang er to the health of the infant or his family and is amenable to treatment; (II) The incidence of the condition is sufficiently high to warrant screening ; (III) The test meets commonly accepted clinical standards of reliability , as demonstrated throug h research or use in another state or jurisdiction; and (IV) The cost-benefit consequences of screening are acceptable within the contex t of the total newborn screening prog ram. (2) The executive director of the department of public health and environment shall assess a fee which is sufficient to cover the costs of such testing and to accomplish the other purposes of this part 10. Hospitals shall assess a reasonable fee to be charged the parent or parents of the infant to cover the costs of handling the specimens, the reimbursement of laboratory costs, and the costs of providing other services necessary to implement the purposes of this part 10. 25-4-10 04.5. Follow -up testing and treatm ent - second screening - legislative declaration - f ee - rules. (1) The g eneral assembly finds that: (a) Newborn screening authoriz ed by section 25-4-1004 is provided for every newborn in the state; (b) Newborn testing is desig ned to identify metabolic disorders that cause mental retardation and other health problems unless they are diag nosed and treated early in life; (c) In order to ensure that children with metabolic disorders are able to lead as normal a Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 253life as possible and to minimiz e long-term health care costs for such children, it is necessary to provide centraliz ed follow-up testing and treatment services; (d) For over twenty -five y ears the follow-up testing and treatment services were provided by a federal grant that was discontinued June 30, 1993. Since that time, follow-up testing and treatment services have been limited. If alternative sources of funding are not provided, those services will be eliminated. (e) A nominal increase of the fee on newborn screening to cover the costs of providing follow-up and referral services would allow for those services to be continued; (f) Over the past ten years, many children with serious health conditions have received timely diag nosis and treatment as a result of the newborn screening required by this part 10. Such screening has averted the possibility of life-long institutionaliz ation of some children and substantial related health care costs. The general assembly further finds, however , that many infants who are screened early in life may exhibit false or inaccurate results on certain newborn screening tests. The general assembly therefore finds and declares that subsequent newborn screening will provide more accurat e and reliable test results for the timely and effective diagnosis and treatment of certain health conditions in newborn infants and the best interests of children in Colorado will be served by a new screening program that routinely tests all newborns twice. (2) (a) Repealed. (b) On and after July 1, 1994, the executive director of the depa rtment of public health and environment shall increa se the newborn screening fee as provided in section 25-4-1004 (2) so that the fee is sufficient to include the costs of providing follow-up and referral services to families with a newborn whose test results under a newborn scree ning indicate a metabolic disorder. Follow-up services include comprehensive diagnosti c testing. The increase shall not exceed five dollars; except that it may be adjusted annually to reflect any chang e in the Denver- Boulder consume r price index . Any fees collected shall be subject to the provisions of section 25-4-1006. (3) (a) On and after July 1, 1996, all infants born in the state of Colorado who receive newborn screening pursuant to section 25-4-1004 (1) shall have a second specimen taken to screen for the following conditions: (I) Pheny lketonuria; (II) Hypothy roidism; (III) Galactosemia; (IV) Cy stic fibrosis; and (V) Such other conditions as the state board of health may determine meet the criteria set forth in section 25-4-1004 (1) (c) and require a second screening for accurate test results. (b) The executive director of the department of public health and environment is authoriz ed to promulg ate rules, regulations, and standards for the implementati on of the second specimen testing specified in this subsection (3), including but not limited to the following : (I) Identification of those conditions for which a second specimen shall be required; (II) The ag e of the infant at which the second screening may be administered; (III) The method by which the parent or paren ts of a newborn shall be advised of the Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 254necessity for a second specimen test; (IV) The procedure to be followed in administering the second specimen test; (V) Any exceptions to the necessit y for a second specimen test and the procedures to be followed in such cases; and (VI) The standards of supervision and quality control that shall apply to second specimen testing . (c) On and after July 1, 1996, the executive director of the department of public health and environment may adjust the newborn screening fee set forth in section 25-4-1004 (2) so that the fee is sufficient to cover the costs associated with the second screening described in this subsection (3). Any increase shall be in addition to the fee described in subsection (2) of this section and shall not initially exceed five dollars and seventy -five cents but may be adjusted annually to reflect any actual cost increase associated with the administration of the second screening . Any fees collected pursuant to this parag raph (c) shall be subject to the provisions of section 25-4-1006. (4) The provisions of section 25-4-1003 (2) shall apply to second newborn screening s. 25-4-1004.7. Newborn hearing scree ning - legislative declaration - advisory committee - report - rules. (1) (a) The g eneral assembly finds, determines, and declares: (I) That hearing loss occurs in newborn infants more frequently than any other health condition for which newborn infant screening is required; (II) That eighty percent of the language ability of a child is established by the time the child is eighteen months of age and that hearing is vitally important to the healthy development of such lang uage skills; (III) That early detection of hearing loss in a child and early intervention and treatment has been demonstrated to be highly effective in facilitating a child's healthy development in a manner consistent with the child' s age and cog nitive ability ; (IV) That children with hearin g loss who do not receive such early intervention and treatment frequently require special educati onal services and that such services are publicly funded for the vast majority of children with hearing needs in the state; (V) That appropriate testing and identification of newborn infants with hearing loss will facilitate early intervention and treatment and may therefore serve the public purposes of promoting the healthy development of children and reducing public ex penditure; and (VI) That consumers shou ld be entitled to know whether the hospital at which they choose to deliver their infant provides newborn hearing screening . (b) For these reasons the general assembly hereby determines that it would be benefici al and in the best interests of the development of the child ren of the state of Colorado that newborn infants' hearing be screened. (2) (a) (I) There is hereby established an advisory committee on hearing in newborn infants for the purpose of collecting the informa tional data specified in parag raph (b) of subsection (3) of this section, and for the purpose of providing recommendations to hospitals, other health care institutions, the department of publi c health and environment, and the public concerning , but not necessarily limited to, the following : Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 255(A) Appropriate methodolog ies to be implemented for hearing screening of newbor n infants, which methodologies shall be objective and physiolog ically based and which shall not include a requirement that the initial newborn hearing screening be performed by an audiolog ist; (B) The number of births sufficient to qualify a hospital or health institution to arrang e otherwise for hearing screening s; and (C) Guidelines for repor ting and the means to assure that identified children receive referral for appropriate follow-up services. (II) The advisory committee on hearing in newborn infants shall consist of at least seven members who shall be appointed by the executive director of the department of public health and envir onment. Members appointed to the committee shall have training , experience, or interest in the area of hearing conditions in children. (III) The members of the advisory committee on hearing in newborn infants shall serve without compensation. (IV) Repealed. (b) Repealed. (3) (a) It is the intent of the general assembly that newborn hearing screening be conducted on no fewer than ninety -five percent of the infants born in hospitals, using procedures recommended by the advisory committee on hearing in newborn infants, created in subsection (2) of this section. Toward that end, every licensed or certified hospital shall educate the parents of infants born in such hospitals of the importance of screening the hearing of newborn infants and follow-up care. Education shall not be considered a substitute for the hearing screening described in this section. Every licensed or certified hospital shall report annually to the advisory committee concerning the following : (I) The number of infants born in the hospital; (II) The number of infants screened; (III) The number of infants who passed the screening , if administered; and (IV) The number of infants who did not pass the screening , if administered. (b) The advisory committee on hearing in newborn infants shall determine which hospitals or other health care institutions in the state of Colorado are administering hearing screening to newborn infants on a voluntary basis and the number of infants screened.

(4) (a) If the number of infants screened falls below eighty-five percent, the board of health shall promulg ate rules requiring hearing screening of newborn infants pursuant to section 24-4-103, C.R.S., of the \" State Administrative Procedure Act\" . (b) Such rules, if promulg ated, shall address those hospitals with a low volume of births, as determined by the state board of health based upon recommendations by the advisory committee on hearing in newborn infan ts, which may arrang e otherwise for newborn infant hearing screening . (5) A physician, nurse, midwife, or other health professional attending a birth outside a hospital or institution shall provide information, as established by the department, to parents regarding places where the parents may have their infants' hearing screened and the importance Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 256of such screening . (6) The department shall encourag e the cooperation of county , district, and municipal public health agencies, health care clinics, school districts, and any other appropriate resources to promote the screening of newborn infants' hearing for those infants born outside a hospital or institution. 25-4-1005. Exceptions. Nothing in the provisions of this part 10 shall be construed to require the testing or medical treatment for the minor child of any person or of any person who is a member of a well-recog nized church or religious denomination and whose religious convict ions in accordance with the tenets or principles of his church or religious denomination are against medical treatment for disease or physical defects or has a personal objection to the administration of such tests or treatment. 25-4-1006 .

PART 24 IMMUNI ZATION REGI STRY ACT 25-4-2401. Short title. This part 24 shall be known and may be cited as the \"Immuniz ation Reg istry Act\" . 25-4-2402. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly hereby finds and declares that: (a) Immuniz ation is one of the most important ways to protect individuals and communities against serious infectious diseases and their consequences, and widespread immuniz ation has virtually eliminat ed many serious diseases that were once responsible for millions of infections and thousands of deaths each y ear. (b) Althoug h immuniz ation rates of infants, children, adolescents, and adults in Colorado have improved over the last several years, there is a need to continue to improve the rates so that fewer individuals are put at risk from vaccine-preventable diseases. (c) Timely vaccination of children, adolescents, and adults not only protects them against common, sometimes serious, and potentially fatal diseases, but also serves the community as one of the most successful and cost-effective public health tools available for the prevention and spread of these infections, and the vaccines are safe and highly protective, particularly when administered according to recommended schedules. (d) More than twenty percent of preschool-ag ed children in Colorado are not fully Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 312vaccinated and are at increased risk of contracting and spreading vaccine-preventable diseases. (e) It is unnecessary for childr en, adolescents, and adults to be subjected to suffering or death from diseases that are immuniz ation preventable. (f) In 2005, hospital charg es for the care of children with vaccine-preventable diseases exceeded twenty -five million dollars. Additionally , tens of millions of dollars were spent on the costs of the outpatient care of affected children, in addition to the costs of the loss of productivity and absences from work for careg ivers due to the absences of children from school. (g) Over the past three decades, the recommended vaccination schedules for children and adults have become increasing ly more complex as vaccines have been combined, new vaccines have been added, and the delivery system has incorporated more manufacturers, distributors, and providers. Additionally , local and national vaccine shortag es and distribution errors have resulted in compromised vaccination initiatives. (h) For Colorado to be consistent with the healthy people 2010 initiat ive and reach the goal of immuniz ing ninety percent of all children in the state in a timely and expeditious manner, the Colorado immuniz ation information system must be funded and sustained. The Colorado immuniz ation information system may also provide a secure meth od for authoriz ed individuals and entities to access information collected by public ag encies. (2) Therefore, the general assembly supports the expansion of the Colorado immuniz ation reg istry and supports increased access to immuniz ations for persons in Colorado. 25-4-2403. Departm ent of public health and environm ent - powers and duties - immunization tracking system - definitions.

Regulations. (1) Definitions and standards of identity , quality , and fill of container for any food adopted under authority of the federal act are the definitions and standards of identity , quality , and fill of container in this state.

Such determination as to streng th, quality , or purity shall be made in accordance with the tests or methods of assay set forth in such compendium or, in case of the absence or inade quacy of such tests or methods of assay , those prescribed under authori ty of the federal act. No drug defined in an official compendium shall be deemed to be adulterated under this parag raph (g) because it differs from the standard of streng th, quality , or purity therefor set forth in such compendium if its difference in streng th, quality , or purity from such standard is plainly stated on its label. Whenever a drug is recog nized in both the United States pharmacopoeia and the homeopathic pharmacopoeia of the United States, it shall be subject to the requirements of the United States pharmacopoeia unless it is labeled and offered for sale as a homeopathic drug, in which case it shall be subject to the provisions of the homeopathic pharmacopoeia of the United States and not to those of the United States pharmacopoeia.

To the extent that compliance with the requirements of this sub-subparag raph (B) and sub-subparag raph (A) of this subparag raph (I) as to fabricated drugs is impracticable, exemptions shall be established by regulations promulg ated by the department or under the federal act. (II) As used in this paragraph (e), the term \"established name\" , with respect to a drug or ingredient thereof, means: (A) The applicable official name desig nated pursuant to the federal act; or (B) If there is no such name and such drug or such ingredient is an article recog nized in an official compendium, then the official title thereof in such compendium; or (C) If neither sub-subparag raph (A) nor sub-subparag raph (B) of this subparag raph (II) applies, then the common or usual name, if any , of such drug or of such ing redient; (D) Where sub-subp aragraph (B) of this subparag raph (II) applies to an article recog nized in the United States pharmacopoeia and in the homeopathic pharmacopoeia under different official titles, the official title used in the United States pharmacopoeia shall apply unless it is labele d and offered for sale as a homeopathic drug, in which case the official title used in the homeopathic pharmacopoeia shall apply . (f) Unless its labeling bears adequate directions for use and such adequate warning s against use in those patholog ical conditions or by children where its use may be dang erous to health or against unsafe dosag e or methods or duration of administration or application, in such manner and form as are necessary for the protection of users; but, where any requirement as to such adequate directions for use, as applied to any drug or device, is not necessary for the protection of the public health, the department shall promulg ate regulations exempting such drug or device from such requirement, and articles exempted under regulations issued under the federal act shall also be ex empt; (g) If it purports to be a drug, the name of which is recog nized in an official compendium, unless it is packag ed and labeled as prescribed therein; but the method of packing may be modified with the consent of the department or if consent is obtained under the federal act.

(14) The commission shall repeal the clean vehicle fleet program mandated by section 246 of the federal act and shall replace such program if required by federal law. Nothing in this subsection (14) shall be deemed to impair the availability of the income tax credit established pursuant to section 39-22-516, C.R.S. (15) The commission shall promulg ate rules and regulations as are necessary to provide an emission reduction incentive permit fee credit progr am which provides for a permit fee reduction in the year following the year in which a permittee achieves an early reduction in emissions of hazardous air pollutants, consistent with the provisions of section 112 of the federal act and section 25-7-114.3. (16) The commission shall give priority to and take expeditious action upon consideration of the following : Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 414(a) A request by a unit of local government to investigate and resolve air quality problems associated with a source; (b) A request by a unit of local government for inclusion of a locally developed air pollution control measure in a state implementation plan; (c) A request by a unit of local government that the commission consider local concerns respecting environmental and economic effects in the contex t of a proceeding where the state is targeting a source for imposition of additional air pollution controls. (17) (a) Not later than December 31, 2002, and no less frequently than every five years thereafter, the commission shall conduct rule-making hearing s to approve an update to the emissio n inventories from state and federal public land manag ement agency activities on public lands resulting in emissions of any criteria pollutant, including surrog ates or precursors for that pollutant, that affect any mandatory class I federal areas in Colorado by reducing visibility in such areas. At a minimum, such inventories shall report on emissions from the sources set forth in parag raph (d) of this subsection (17). (b) The commission shall ensure that the division prepares invento ries for all state land manag ement agencies with jurisdiction over state lands, including , without limitation, the state land board, the department of agriculture, and the department of natural resour ces, to provide an inventory of emissions from land manag ement activities that are sources of pollutant emissions that may affect any mandatory class I federal area in Colorado by reduc ing visibility in such areas; except that the commission shall exempt from the inventory requirement any sources or categ ories of sources that it determines to be of minor sig nificance. (c) The commission shall use the emission inventories provided under this subsection (17) to develop control strateg ies for reducing emissions within the state as a component of the visibility long-term strateg ies for inclusion in the state implementation plan and for inclusion in any environmental impact statement or environmental assessment required to be performed under the federal \" National Environmental Policy Act of 1969\" , 42 U.S.C. secs. 4321 to 4347. (d) The rule-making hearing held to approv e the inventories provided under this subsection (17) shall require public participation and shall require the reporting of both current emissions and projected future emissions, over at least a five-y ear period, from the following sources on public land that affect any mandatory class I federal areas in Colorado: (I) Stationary source emissions, based on existing air pollution emission notices filed with the division; (II) Mobile sources utiliz ing state lands, ex cluding state and federal hig hway s; (III) Paved and unpaved roads; (IV) F ires on public lands from all sources; (V) B iogenic sources, including emissions from flora and fauna. (e) Each inventory provided under this subsection (17) shall state the basis and methodolog y used to accumulate the data and shall be based upon data that are: (I) Developed no later than three y ears prior to the submittal; and (II) No more than five y ears old. (18) Upon petition by any person or on its own motion, for good cause shown, the commission may determine that the emission inventory of any criteria pollutant, including a surrog ate or precursor for that pollutant, for a region of the state is inade quate for purposes of Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 415commission rule-making or adjudications in connect ion with development of the state implementation plan, selection of pollution control strateg ies, attribution of emissions to sources or categ ories of sources, or finding s of adverse impacts. If, after conducting a public hearing in accordance with the rule-making provisions of the \"State Administrative Procedure Act\", article 4 of title 24, C.R.S. , the commission finds that the emission inventory should be revised to take into consideration existing credible studies or scientific data in order to reasonably attribute emissions to source categ ories, it shall direct that such revision be performed prior to a final rule- making or adjudication. (19) The commission may coordinate with the United States secretary of the interior and the United States secretary of ag riculture to develop air quality manag ement plans consistent with this article for federal lands pursuant to 16 U.S.C. sec. 530, 16 U.S.C. sec. 1604, and 43 U.S.C. sec. 1712.

Federal enforceability. (1) To the extent that any provision of this article or any standard or regulation promulg ated pursuant thereto is not required by Part C (prevention of significant deteri oration), Part D (nonattainment), or Title V (minimum elements of a permit program) of the federal act, or is not required by section 111 of the federal act, or is not required for sources to participate in the early reduction program of section 112 of the federal act, or is not required for sources to be excluded as a major source under this article, or is otherwise more string ent than other requirements of the federal act, such provisio n, standard, or regulation is hereby declared to be adopted under powers reserved to the state of Colorado pursuant to section 116 of the federal act. Any such provision, standard, or regulation adopted exclusively under state authority shall not constitute part of the state implementation plan. (2) Whenever the division or commission grants relief to an owner or operator of a new or modified stationary source from that part of a state standard or reg ulation which is not required by Part C (prevention of significant deterioration), Part D (nonattainment), or Title V (minimum elements of a permit program) of the federal act, or is not required by section 111 of the federal act, or is not required for sources to participate in the early reduction program of section 112 of the federal act, or is not required for sourc es to be excluded as a major source under this article, or which is otherwise more string ent than other requirements of the federal act and is not included as part of the state implementation plan, such relief shall be governed exclusively by the laws of this state and the reg ulations of the commission. (3) To the extent any term or condition contained in any permit issued pursuant to this article is not required by Part C (prevention of significant deterioration), Part D (nonattainment), or Title V (minimum elements of a permit program) of the federal act, or is not required by Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 416section 111 of the federal act, or is not required for sources to participate in the early reduction program of section 112 of the federal act, or is not required for sources to be excluded as a major source under this article, or is otherwise more string ent than other requirements of the federal act, such term or condition shall be subject to enforcement exclusively under the laws of this state and the reg ulations of the commission. 25-7-106. Com mission - additional authority. (1) Except as provided in sections 25-7- 130 and 25-7-131, the commission shall have maximum flexibility in developing an effective air quality control program and may promulg ate such combination of regulations as may be necessary or desirable to carry out that program; except that such program and regulations shall be consistent with the legislative declaration set forth in section 25-7-102. Such regulations may include, but shall not be limited to: (a) Classification and, as appropriate, reclas sification of the state into attainment, nona ttainment, and unclassifiable areas, and division of the state into such control regions or areas as may be necessary or desirable for effective administration of this article; (b) Classification and definition of different deg rees or ty pes of air pollution; (c) Emission control regulations that are applicable to the entire state, that are applicable only within specified areas or zones of the state, or that are applicable only when a specified class of pollution is present; (d) Development of a high altitude performance adjustment program for motor vehicles to the ex tent authoriz ed by section 215 of the federal act; (e) Development of a control or prohibition respecting the use of a fuel or fuel additives in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine to the extent authorized by section 211(c) of the federal act if, based on sound scientific data, the commission finds that a measurable reduction in ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants or other pollutants shall occur. (2) The commis sion may hold public hearing s, issue notice of hearing s, issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidenc e, administer oaths, and take such testimony as it deems necessary , all in conformity with article 4 of title 24, C.R.S., and with sections 25-7-110 and 25-7-119.

(4) (a) In the event the commission, after hearing , finds and determines that a particular style or model of automobile air pollution control device is not sufficiently effective to justify the continued connection and operation of such device, the commission shall so notify the department of revenue; thereafter, all devices of such particular style or model shall be exempt from the provisions of section 42-4-314, C.R.S. (b) Repealed. (4.1) Repealed. (5) The commission may exercise all incidental powers necessary to carry out the purposes of this article. (6) The commission may require the owner or operator, or both, of any air pollution Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 417source to: (a) Establish and maintain reports as prescribed by the commission; (b) Install, use, and maintain monitoring equipment or methods as prescribed by the commission; (c) Record, monitor, and sample emissions in accordance with such methods, at such locations, at such intervals, and in such manner as the commission shall prescribe; (d) Provide such other information as the commission may require. (7) (a) The commission is specif ically authoriz ed and directed to develop a program to apply and enforce every relevant provision of the state implementation plan and every relevant emission control strateg y to minimiz e emissions, including the impacts of actions by significant users of prescribed fire, including federal, state, and local government, and private land manag ers that are significant users of prescribed fire. The program developed by the commission under this subsection (7) shall include, but not be limited to, the imposition of any fees necessary to administer the prog ram, including the recovery of costs by the state for the evaluation of planning documents pursuant to subsection (8) of this section, and the imposition of penalties pursuant to section 25-7-122. (b) The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that the Grand Cany on visibility transport commission' s recommendations for improving western vistas report identified the emissions from fire, both wildfire and prescribed fires, as likely to have the singl e greatest impact on visibility at class I areas throug h the year 2040. The emissio ns from fire, both wildfire and prescribed fire, are an important episodic contributor to visibility impairing aerosols. The Grand Cany on visibility transport commission report identified that significant amounts of visibility impairment resul t from activities on federal lands, from mobile sources, and from Mexico. (c) The general assembly further finds, determ ines, and declares that emissions from grassland and forest fires have substantial episodic impacts on ambient air quality throug hout the state and are a major source of visibility impairment over whic h this state has jurisdiction but has not y et developed a comprehensive prog ram to reduce such impairment. (d) The general assembly further finds, determines, and declares that the standard in its statement of legislative purpose in section 25-7-102 of the \"Colorado Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act\" requiring the use of all practical methods that are technolog ically feasible and economically reasonable so as to reduce, prevent, and control air pollution is an appropriate standard to apply in relation to air pollution emissions resulting from the use of prescribed fire in grassland and forest manag ement. (e) This subsection (7) and subsection (8) of this section are adopted pursuant to section 118 of the federal act and shall be construed to exercise the full extent of the state' s authority as granted by the provisions of said federal act. The federal government, as the only landowner of its size in the state and the only landowner in the state other than the state government itself that routinely prepares plans involving the manag ement of grassland and forest lands using prescribed fire, is appropriately subject to the requirements of this section pertaining to review and appro val of planning documents. (f) Persons owning or mana ging large parcels of land who significantly use prescribed fire as a grassland or forest manag ement tool shall prepare plans addressing the use and role of Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 418prescribed fire and the air qualit y impacts resulting therefrom, and such plans are appropriately subject to the review requirements of this section. The state, by reviewing these types of plans, can achieve significant progress towards cooperatively reducing emissions from those lands that impact visibility in Colorado. (g) As used in this subsection (7) and in subsection (8) of this section, the term \"significant user of prescribed fire\" means a federal, state, or local agency or significant manag ement unit thereof or person that collectively manag es or owns more than ten thousand acres of grasslands or forest lands within the state of Colorado and that uses prescribed fire. The adoption of a fire manag ement plan by a local or county unit of government pursuant to section 30-11-124, C.R.S., does not constitute manag ement for purposes of this section unless the county or local unit of government owns or manag es more than ten thousand acres and is a significant user of prescribed fire. \"Prescribed fire\" means fire that is intention ally used for grassland or forest manag ement, regardless of whether the fire is caused by natural or human sources. Prescribed fire does not include open burning in the course of agricultura l operations and does not include open burning for the purpose of maintaining water convey ance structures, unless the commi ssion acts pursuant to section 25-7-123. The commission shall by rule exempt from the program developed pursuant to this subsection (7) those sources that have an insig nificant impact on visibility and air quality . (8) (a) The commis sion, in exercising the powers conferred by subsection (7) of this section and this subsection (8), shall require all significant users of prescribed fire, including federal agencies for activities directly conducted by or on behalf of federal agencies on federal lands, to minimize emissions using all available, practicable methods that are technolog ically feasible and economically reasonable in order to minimize the impact or reduce the potential for such impact on both the attainment and maintenance of national ambient air quality standards and the achievement of federal and state visibility goals. (b) (I) In order to ensure compliance with the requirements of parag raph (a) of this subsection (8), significant users of prescribed fire shall submit planning documents to the commissio n. The commission shall then conduct a public hearing to review each planning document submitted relevant to achieving the goal of minimiz ing emissions and impacts as set forth in parag raph (a) of this subsection (8). Only one hearin g shall be held for each planning document. The commission shall hold a hearing and complete its review of the planning documents submitted by any significant user of prescribed fire within forty-five days of their receipt by the commission, unless otherwise ag reed to by the sig nificant user of prescribed fire. (II) As used in this parag raph (b), \"planning documents\" means documents that summariz e the use of prescr ibed fire as a grassland or forest manag ement tool and the associated discharg e or release of air pollution and that demonstrate how compliance with the state standard expressed in section 25-7-102 shall be achieved. \"Planning documents\" shall include land manag ement plans or a summary of the equivalent information that explains and supports the land manag ement criteria evaluated and the decision to use prescribed fire as the fuel treatment method. Planning documents shall include a discussion of the alternatives considered and a discussion of how prescribed fire, if selected, minimiz es the risk of wildfire. (III) The commission shall have discretion to adopt rules governing the resubmission of planning documents to prevent such plans from becoming outdated. Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 419(c) Following a public hearing , the commission shall comment and make recommendations to the significant user of prescribed fire regarding any chang es to elements of the plan relating to the discharg e or release of air pollutants that the commission finds necessary to comply with the state standard ex pressed in section 25-7-102. 25-7-106.1. Com mission - duties - visibility standard - report. (Repealed) 25-7-106.3. Com mission - duties - wood-burning stoves - episodic no-burn days - rules. (1) The commission shall promulg ate, no later than March 1, 1990, such combination of regulations as it may find to be cost-effective and consistent with the legislative declaration set forth in section 25-7-102 in order to establish limitations on the use of wood-burning stoves and fireplaces during those periods of time declared by the Colorado department of health to be a high pollution day. The department may declare a high pollution day based on experienced or anticipated excessive levels of carbon monox ide or particulates when air pollution standard s are exceeded for particulates, carbon monox ide, or visibility . The limitations on the use of wood- burning stoves and fireplaces imposed pursuant to this section may include no-burn days, and such no-burn days shall be specific to the separate airsheds within the Denver-B oulder metropolitan area. Such limitations shall be applicable only in those portions of the counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Denver, Doug las, and Jefferson which are located in the AIR program area, as such area is defined in section 42-4-3 04 (20), C.R.S. Such regulations shall exclude areas above seven thousand feet unless the commission determines that particulates from wood burning in such areas are contributing to the brown cloud. Such regulations shall not apply to any person who utiliz es wood-burni ng stoves or fireplaces as the primary source of heat in such person' s place of residence. Such regulations shall perm it exemptions for wood-burning stoves that meet Phase III emissions standards.

Commission to prom ulgate ambient air qual ity standards. (1) In addition to the other powers and duties enumerated in this article , the commission shall have the power to adopt, promulg ate, amend, and modify such standards for the quality of ambient air as may be appropriate or necessary to carry out the purposes of this article, including , but not limited to: (a) Standards which describe the maximum conce ntrations of specifically described pollutants that can be tolerated, consistent with the protection of the good health of the public at large; such standards may differ for different parts of the state as may be necessitated by variations in altitude, topog raphy , climate, or meteorolog y; (b) Standards which describe the air quality goals that are to be achieved by control programs within specified periods of time; such standards may be either statewide or restricted to specified control areas; and (c) Standards which describe vary ing degrees of pollution of ambient air. (2) Ambient air standards shall include such requirements for test methods and procedures as will assure that the samples of ambient air tested are representative of the ambient air. (3) Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary , no provision of this article shall preclude the commission from adopting ambient air quality standards which are more string ent than the national ambient air quality standards. (4) Ambient standards may only be implemented and enforced through permit terms and conditions or reg ulations promulg ated to meet requirements for state implementation plans. 25-7-109. Com mission to prom ulgate emission control regulations. (1) (a) Except as provided in sections 25-7-130 and 25-7-131, as promptly as possible, the commission shall adopt, promulg ate, and from time to time modify or repeal emission control regulations which require the use of effective practical air pollution controls: (I) For each sig nificant source or categ ory of sig nificant sources of air pollutants; (II) For each type of facility , process, or activity which produces or might produce significant emissions of air pollutants. (b) The requirements and prohibitions contained in such regulations shall be set forth with as much specificity and clarity as is practical. Upon adoption of an emission control regulation under subparag raph (II) of paragraph (a) of this subsection (1) for the control of a specific facility , process, or activity , such regulation shall apply to the exclusion of other emission control regulations adopted pursuant to subparag raph (I) of parag raph (a) of this subsection (1); prior to such adoption, the general regulations adopted pursuant to subparag raph (I) of parag raph (a) of this subsection (1) shall be applicable to such facility , proces s, or activity. In the formulation of each emission control regulation, the commission shall take into consideration the following : (I) The state policy regarding air pollution, as set forth in section 25-7-102; (II) Federal recommendations and requirements; (III) The degree to which altitude, topog raphy , climate, or meteorolog y in certain portions of the state require that emission control regulations be more or less string ent than in Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 422other portions of the state; (IV) The degree to which any particular type of emission is subject to treatment, and the availability , technical feasibility , and economic reasonableness of control techniques; (V) The ex tent to which the emission to be controlled is sig nificant; (VI) The continuous, intermittent, or seasonal nature of the emission to be controlled; (VII) The econ omic, environmental, and energ y costs of compliance with such emission control reg ulation; (VIII) Whether an emission control regulation should be applied throug hout the entire state or only within specified areas or zones of the state, and whether it should be applied only when a specified class or ty pe of pollution is concerned. (2) Such emission control regulations may include, but shall not be limite d to, regulations pertaining to: (a) Visible pollutants; (b) Particulates; (c) Sulfur oxides, hydrocarbons, fluorides, and any other chemical substance; (d) Odors, except for livestock feeding operations that are not housed commercial swine feeding operations as defined in section 25-8-501.1 (2) (b); (e) Open burning activity ; (f) Org anic solvents; (g) Photochemical substances; (h) Haz ardous air pollutants. (3) Emission control regulations adopted pursuant to this section shall include, but shall not be limited to, reg ulations pertaining to the following facilities, processes, and activities: (a) I ncinerator and incinerator desig n; (b) Storag e and transfer of petroleum products and any other volatile organic compounds; (c) Activities which frequently result in particulate matter becoming airborne, such as construction and demolition operations; (d) Specifi cations, prohibitions, and requirements pertaining to fuels and fuel additives, such as tetraethy l lead; (e) Wigwam waste burners, pulp mills, alfalfa dehy drators, asphalt plants, and any other industrial or commercial activity which tends to emit air pollutants as a by -product; (f) Industrial process equipment; (g) Industrial spray ing operations; (h) Airplanes; (i) Diesel-powered machines, vehicles, eng ines, and equipment; (j) Storag e and transfer of volatile compounds and hazardous or toxic gases or other hazardous substances which may become airborne. (4) The commission shall promu lgate appropriate regulations pertaining to hazardous air pollutants. (5) The commission shall promulg ate appropriate regulations setting conditions and time Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 423limitations for periods of start-up, shutdown, or malfunctio n or other conditions which justify temporary relief from contr ols. Operations of any air pollution source during periods of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constit ute representative conditions for the purpose of a performance or compliance test. (6) The commission shall establish test methods and procedures for determining compliance with emission control regulations promulg ated under this section and, in so doing , shall, to the maximum degree consistent with the purposes of this article, consider the test methods and procedures estab lished by the United States environmental protection agency and shall adopt such test methods and procedures as shall minimiz e the possibility of inconsistency or duplication of effort. (7) All regulations promulg ated pursuant to this section shall conform with the provisions of part 5 of this article concerning asbestos control. (8) (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commission shall not regulate emissio ns from agricultural, horticultural, or floricultural production such as farming , seasonal crop drying, animal feeding operations that are not housed commercial swine feeding operations as defined in section 25-8-501.1 (2) (b), and pesticide application; except that the commission shall regulate such emissions if they are \"major stationary sources\" , as that term is defined in 42 U.S.C. sec. 7602 (j), or are required by Part C (prevention of significant deterioration), Part D (nonattainment), or Title V (minimum elements of a permit program), or are participating in the early reduction program of section 112 of the federal act, or is not required by section 111 of the federal act, or is not required for sources to be excluded as a major source under this article. (b) Nothing in parag raph (a) of this subsection (8), as amende d by House Bill 05-1180, as enacted at the first regular session of the sixty-fifth general assembly , shall be construed as changing the property tax classification of property owned by a horticultural or floricultural operation. (9) (a) The commission shall adopt a procedure consistent with the federal environmental protection agency requirements for determining when there has been a net significant emissions increase which results in a major modification that subjects a source to the permitting requirements of the prevention of significant deterioration program or the nonattainment area new source review. The commission' s procedure shall also prohibit sources from circumventing the new source review requirements in a manner consistent with the federal environmental protection agency guidanc e. Such procedure shall be the same for both the prevention of significant deterioration program and the nonattainment area new source review program and shall not apply to hazardous air pollutants . Such net emissions increase procedure shall be as described in parag raph (b) of this subsection (9), unless and until the federal environmental protection ag ency requires otherwise or unless after J anuary 1, 1998, the commission: (I) Undertakes a collaborative process with the affected industries to determine the cost and emission impacts associated with any proposed chang es in this procedure; (II) Reviews at least three years of emissions increases and decreases under the procedures described in parag raph (b) of this subsection (9); (III) Delivers reports on the matters required in subparag raphs (I) and (II) of this parag raph (a) to the g eneral assembly for its review; Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 424(IV) Determines throug h rule-making that an applicability procedure for major modifications more string ent than that described in parag raph (b) of this subsection (9) is equitable when considering minor, area, and mobile source controls; and (V) Determines throug h rule-making that such more string ent applicability procedur e is necessary to attain and to maintain the national ambient air quality standards. (b) The procedure for determining when there has been a net significant emission s increase shall be consistent with requirements of the federal environmental protection agency and: (I) Such requirements shall apply only if there is, in the first instance, a significant emissions increase from an individual propo sed project or modification. If the individual proposed project or modification will not result in a significant emissions increase, it shall be exempt from the prevention of significant deterioration program and the nonattainment area new source review requirements. (II) If a project or modification is not exempt under subparag raph (I) of this parag raph (b), each pollutant for which the project results in a significant emissions increase shall be subject to the prevention of significant deterioration program or the nonattainment area new source review requirements only if the sum of all source-wide, non-de minimis, contemporaneous, and creditable emissions increases and decreases of that pollutant or that regulated precursor exceed applicable significance levels. Each specific regulated precursor shall be considered independently in determining applicable sig nificance levels. (III) In determining the non-de minimis net emissions increase during the contemporaneous period, the commission' s procedures shall be consistent with the federal environmental protection agency's review procedure for determining net emissions increases and decre ases. Non-de minimis increases shall exclude all increases which would be exempt under commission rules from a requirement to obtain a construction permit under section 25-7-114.2. 25-7-109.1. Emergency rule-m aking. In addition to all other powers of the commission, the commission, pursuant to section 24-4-103 (6), C.R.S., shall have the authority to conduct emerg ency rule-making for the purpose of adopting an interim emission control regulation to apply for a specified period of time in place of an existing emission control regulation or to create an emission control regulation whenever federal regulations have been adopted and become effective pursuan t to section 111 of the federal act and which add to the list of categ ories of stationary sources, or add new or more restrictive standar ds of performance for new sources, or whenever federal regulatio ns are adopted and effective pursuant to section 112 of the federal act and which modify or adopt MACT or GACT for new or existing sources, and such regulations are required to be implemented by the states. Interim emission control regulations adopted pursuant to this section shall not be effective for a period greater than twelve months from the date of adoption. 25-7- 109.2. Small business stationary source technical and environm ental compliance assistance program - repeal. (1) The commission shall promulg ate such rules, Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 425regulations, and procedures as are necessary to establish and administer the Colorado small business stationary source technical and environmental compliance assistance prog ram consistent with the requirements of the federal act. (2) There is hereby created a compliance advisory panel which shall: (a) Render advisory opinions concerning the effectiveness of the small business stationary sourc e technical and environmental compliance assistance program, difficulties encountered, deg ree of enforcement, and severity of penalties; (b) Make periodic reports to the governor and the administrator of the United States environmental protection ag ency; (c) Review information for small business stationary sources to assure such information is understandable by the lay person; and (d) Oversee the small business stationar y source technical and environmental compliance assistance program, which shall serve as the secretariat for the development and disseminati on of such reports and advisory opinions. (3) The panel shall consist of: (a) Two members who are not owners or representatives of owners of small business stationary sources, appointed by the g overnor to represent the g eneral public; (b) Two members who are owners or who represent owners of small business stationary sources, one appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives and one appointed by the minority leader of the house of representatives; (c) Two members who are owners or who represent owners of small business stationary sources, one appointed by the president of the senate and one appointed by the minority leader of the senate; and (d) One member appointed by the executive director of the department of public health and environment to represent such department. (4) The terms of those members of the panel initially appointed by the governor , the speaker of the house of representatives, and the minority leader of the house of representatives shall ex pire on J anuary 31, 1994. The terms of those members initially appointed by the president of the senate, the minority leader of the senate, and the executive director of the department of public health and environment shall expire on January 31, 1995. Thereafter, members of the panel shall serve for terms of two years, such terms to commence on February 1 of the year of appointment. Vacancies occurring during the term of office of any member of the panel shall be filled for the unex pired portion of the regular term in the same manner as for the original appointment. (5) In furtherance of the small business stationary source technical and environmental compliance assistance program established as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the department of public health and environment shall serve as ombudsman for small business stationary sources. The department shall carry out the ombudsman duties using personnel outside of the air pollution control division. (6) The general assembly finds, determines, and declares that this section is enacted for purposes of compliance with the provisions of section 507 of the federal act, 42 U.S.C. sec. 7661f. Subsections (2), (3), and (4) of this section and this subsection (6) are repealed, effective July 1, 2015. Prior to said repeal, the compliance advisory panel shall be reviewed by a Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 426legislative committee of reference, desig nated pursuant to section 2-3-1201, C.R.S., to conduct the review pursuant to section 24-34-104, C.R.S. 25-7-109.3. Colorado hazardous air pollutant control and reduction program - rules. (1) The commission shall promulg ate appropriate regulations pertaining to hazardous air pollutants as defined in section 25-7-103 (13) which are consistent with this section and the requirements of and emission standards promulg ated pursuant to section 112 of the federal act, including any standard required to be imposed under section 112(r) of the federal act. The commission shall monitor the progress and results of the risk studies performed under section 112 of the federal act to show that Colorado' s hazardous air pollutant control and reduction program is consistent with the national strateg y. (2) The commission may only promulgate regulations pertaining to hazardous air pollutants as defined in section 25-7-103 (13) in accordance with this section. In order to minimize additional regulatory and compliance costs to the state' s economy , any program created by the commission pursuant to this section shall contain a provision which ex empts those sources or categ ories of sources which it determines to be of minor significance from the requirements of the program. Consistent with the provisions of section 25-7-105.1, the commission shall authoriz e synthetic minor sources of hazardous air pollutants by the issuance of construction permits or prohibitory rules or other regulations. Such permits, rules, or regulations shall only be as string ent as necessary to establish synthetic minor status. The commission shall expeditiously implement this subsection (2) to assure that all sources may be able to timely qualify as a synthetic minor source, thereby avoiding the costs of the operating permit prog ram. (3) (a) (I) As soon as adequate scientific, technolog ical, and hazardous air pollutant emissions information is available, the commission may promulg ate reg ulations for the control of hazardous air pollutants utiliz ing Colorado GACT or Colorado MACT technolog y-based emission reduction requirements, as defined in section 25-7-103 (6.7) and (6.8). (II) The division may establish schedules of compliance of up to five years leading to final compliance for any such regulation, which shall be enforced throug h regulations or conditions in construction permits issued pursuant to section 25-7-114.2 or 25-7-114.5. In determining any schedule of compliance, the division shall consider the current availab ility of technolog y, costs of compliance, and the consequence of delay to the public health or environment or economy . (III) The division shall issue its determina tion of Colorado GACT or Colorado MACT and the compliance schedule in writing . (IV) Within thirty calendar days after receipt of a determination by the division requirin g installation of Colorado GACT or Colorado MACT and the complianc e schedule, pursuant to this subsection (3), a source may appeal such a determination or compliance schedule by filing with the commission a written petition requesting a hearing to review the determi nation on a de novo basis. (V) Such hearing shall allow the parties to present evidence and argument on all issues and to conduct cross-ex amination required for full disclosure of the facts and shall otherwise be conducted in accordance with section 25-7-119. Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 427(b) This section shall only apply to sources emitting a hazardous air pollutant identified in the list established or amended pursuant to subsection (5) of this section which: (I) Are not included in categ ories or subcateg ories of sources listed or proposed to be listed by the environmental protection agency under section 112 of the federal act and thus will not be required to comply with GACT or MACT under the federal act, as defined in section 25- 7-103 (12.1) and (16.5); or (II) Are included in categ ories or subcateg ories of sources listed or proposed to be listed under section 112 of the federal act and which have: (A) Levels of emissions of hazardous air pollutants listed under section 112 (b) of the federal act which are below thresholds established under the federal act and thus will not be required to comply with GACT and MACT under the federal act and as defined in section 25-7- 103 (12.1) and (16.5); ex cept that this section shall not apply to a source included in a categ ory or subcateg ory for which a lesser quantity emission rate has been proposed or adopted under section 112 of the federal act; or (B) Hazardous air pollutant emissions above a threshold level of the substance listed under subparag raph (I I) of parag raph (a) and parag raph (b) of subsection (5) of this section. (b.1) The commission and the air quality science advisory board may recognize similaritie s among regulated sources or apply, when appropriate, previous control requirements established by the commission in making a determination about the need for such regulatio n under this subsection (3). The commission and the science advisory board shall also consider fundamentally different factors between sources in making these determinations. (c) The commission shall desig nate by regulation those classes of minor or insig nificant sources of emissions of hazardous air pollutants which are exempt from the requirements of this section because their emissions of hazardous air pollutants will result in an inconsequen tial risk to public health. (d) (I) A source subject to the requirements of this section may be exempt from installation of Colorado MACT or Colorado GACT or any Colorado health-based requirement if the division makes a determination that an alternative level of control, including no emission controls, will result in an inconsequential risk to public health. (II) The division shall issue its determination of a source' s request for exemption under this parag raph (d) in writing within sixty days of receipt of a complete application for an exemption and shall publish notice of its determination by at least one publication in a newspaper of general distribution in the area of the source requesting the ex emption. (III) Within thirty calendar days after receipt of a determination by the division of a request for exemption by a source under this parag raph (d), the source or any person may appeal such determination by filing with the commission a writt en petition requesting a hearing to review the exemption request on a de novo basis. Such request shall be referred to the air quality science advisory board for an advisory opinion which shall be considered by the commission. (IV) Such hearing shall allow the parties to present evidence and argument on all issues and to conduct cross-ex amination required for full disclosure of the facts and shall otherwise be conducted in accordance with section 25-7-119. (e) Any source as defined in section 112(i) of the federal act, and regulations promulg ated thereunder, that participates in the early reduction program pursuant to section Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 428112(i) of the federal act, or this article, shall be exempt from the requirements of this section for the same period of time exemptions from federal requirements or requirements under this article are allowed under the early reduction prog ram. (f) This section shall not apply to sources subject to national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) established by the admi nistrator pursuant to the federal act, but only for those emissions for which a NESHAP is established. (g) This section shall not impose requirements on sources included in categories or subcateg ories of sources which are listed in section 112(n) of the federal act which are inconsistent with the timing of studies or assessments conducted under or definitio ns set forth in section 112(n) of the federal act. (4) (a) (I) On or after the risk-based studi es required under sections 112(k)(3), 112(o), and 112(f) of the federal act are completed and received by the commission, the commission may adopt regulations pertaining to those sources identified as emitting hazardous air pollutants regulated under this section which may include additional emission reduction requirements to address any residual risk of health effects with respect to actual persons living in the vicinity of sources after installatio n of technolog y-based controls. Imposition of such requirements may be made upon a determination by the commission that operation of sources without health-based controls does not or will not represent an inconsequential threat to public health. Regulations as finally adopted pursuant to this subsection (4) may apply on a source-specific basis. (II) However, if in 1996 the commission determines that the studies referred to in subparag raph (I) of this paragraph (a) and national strateg y will not be timely or completed, then the commissio n shall direct the science advisory board to evaluate or complete similar studies and issue an advisory report to the commission and the commission may then act pursuant to this subsection (4). (b) In issuing the advisory report, the air quality science advisory board shall take into consideration any studies or reports on health-based assessments which are scientifically sound, including any developed under section 112(k)(3), 112(o), and 112(f) of the federal act. (c) Subject to parag raph (a) of this subsection (4), for existing sources not subject to regulation under section 25-7-114.3, or not subje ct to regulation as a modified source, the commission may promulg ate health-based regulations on a source-by -source basis, with the exceptions specified in parag raph (d) of this subsection (4). (d) The commission and the air quality science advisory board may recog nize similarities among regulated sources or apply , when appropriat e, previous control requirements established by the commission pursuant to parag raph (a) of this subsection (4) in making a determination about the need for such regulation under this subsection (4). The commission and the air quality science advisory board shall also consider fundamentally different factors between sources in making these determinations. (e) The commission may establish schedules of comp liance leading to final compliance for any regulation promulg ated pursuant to this subsection (4). (f) A hearing conducted by the commission under this subsection (4) shall be conducted in accordance with section 25-7-110 or 25-7-119 or article 4 of title 24, C.R.S., as applicable. (g) In reach ing a determination under this subsection (4), the commission shall give consideration to the technical availability of methods of compliance, the costs of compliance, and Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 429the consequences of delay . The commission shall also consider cost-benefit analy sis and risk- benefit analy sis pursuant to section 24-4-103 (4.5), C.R.S. (h) Tem porary exceptional authority. (I) (A) This subparag raph (I) shall apply until such time as the commission is authoriz ed to act pursuant to parag raph (a) of this subsection (4). If the ex ecutive director of the department of public health and environment finds that a source in a categ ory or subcateg ory of sources listed or proposed to be listed under section 112 of the federal act for which MACT or GACT is not scheduled for proposal until after 1997 and presents an unacceptable threat of actual health effects, then the executive director may direct the commission to evaluate and, as necessary , study such actual health effects. The commission may request the air quality science advisory board to evaluate and, as necessary , study whether the impacts of waiting to regulate the emissions of hazardous air pollutants from this source present an unacceptable threat of actual health effects. If, after considering an advisory opinion issued by the board and other available information, the commission finds by a preponderance of the evidence that waiting until the source would be required to install GACT or MACT under section 112 of the federal act will cause an unacceptable incremental threat of actual health effects to persons living in the vicinity of such source, the commission may promulg ate regulations for the control of hazardous air pollutants for the source. The control regulations may include the least restrictive control that will adequately protect the public, including but not limited to: Chemical substitution, pollution prevention, work process modification s, additional control technolog ies, or Colorado MACT or GACT. In promulg ating Colorado GACT or MACT for the source, the commission shall consider and be as consistent as possible with GACT or MACT under section 112 of the federal act, minimiz ation of duplicative capital expenditures and minimiz ation of substantial reconstruction time. The commission shall provide a schedule of compliance leading to final compliance which considers matters identif ied in paragraphs (b), (c), (e), (f), and (g) of this subsection (4). (B) Any source which is required to install Colorado MACT or GACT under regulations promulg ated pursuant to sub-subparag raph (A) of this subparag raph (I) only and which subsequently is required to install federal MACT or GACT that is significantly different than Colorado MACT or GACT and imposes a significant capital cost on the source, then the general assembly shall study and consider whether an operating permit fee credit or a state tax credit for the capital costs, or a percentag e of the costs, is appropriate. (II) Until such time as the commission is authoriz ed to act pursuant to parag raph (a) of this subsection (4) and upon the recommendation of the executive director of the department of public health and environment, the governor may find, as expressed in an executive order, that after an existing source has installed Colorado or federal MACT or GACT, or Colorado MACT or GACT has been proposed for a new source or a modification of an existing source, the source presents an unacceptable threat of actual health effect s. The governor may then direct the commissi on to evaluate and, as necessary , conduct studies on actual health effects. The commission shall then direct the air quality science advisory board to render an advisory opinion on such information and on whether, after technolog y-based controls have been installed, emissions of hazardous air pollutants from this source will cause actual health effects to persons in the vicinity of such source. If the commission, after review ing the advisory opinion, determines by a preponderance of the evidence that emissions of hazardous air pollutants by the Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 430source will cause an unacceptable threat of actual health effects to persons living in the vicinity of such source, the commission may then promulg ate additional technolog y-based control regulations, pollution prevention, or health-based measures to protect the public health. The commission shall provide a schedule of compliance leading to final compliance which considers matters identified in parag raphs (b), (c), (e), (f), and (g ) of this subsection (4). (III) This parag raph (h) shall remain effective only until such time as the commission acts pursuant to its authority under parag raph (a) of this subsection (4). (5) (a) The substances listed in or pursuant to section 112(b) of the federal act, and the following substances, are declared to be hazardous air pollutants and are subject to regulation by the commission under this section: <TBL.25-7-109.3x 1> Chem ical Abstract products (LII)10413-71-5 Nitrilotriacetic acid, erbium(3+) 14807-96-6 Talc (containing acid, (2+) complex 2014 Uncertif ate a reg ulation which amends by adding to, or deleting from, the list of hazardous air pollutants subject to regulation under this section within the state which are not listed as hazardous air pollutants under the federa l act. In amending the list of hazardous air pollutants in parag raph (a) of this subsection (5), the commission shall utiliz e the same standards and criteria which section 112 of the federal act requires the administrator to utilize in amending the list of hazardous air pollutants under the federal act. The commission shall refer any such proposed amendment to the air quality science advisory board for an advisory opinion prior to conducting a proceeding under this parag raph (b). (c) The commission shall by regulation establish de minimis emission levels for each hazardous air pollutant beneath which levels emissions are considered to be of minor significance. (d) The rule-making authoriz ed under parag raphs (b) and (c) of this subsection (5) shall include a hearing to allow the parties to present evidence and argument on all issues and to conduct cross-ex amination required for full disclosur e of the facts and shall otherwise be conducted in accordance with section 25-7-119.

(5) (Deleted by amendment, L . 2001, p. 640, \u00a7 2, effective May 30, 2001.) (6) (a) The fee for filing an air pollutant emission notice or amendment thereto under this section shall be one hundred fifty-two dollars and ninety cents. The money s collected pursuant to this section shall be transmitted to the state treasurer, who shall credit the same to the stationary sources control fund created in section 25-7-114.7 (2) (b) (I ). (b) Notwithstanding the amount specified for the fee in parag raph (a) of this subsection (6), the commission by rule or as otherwise provided by law may reduce the amount of the fee if necessary pursuant to section 24-75-402 (3), C.R.S., to reduc e the uncommitted reserves of the fund to which all or any portion of the fee is credited. After the uncommitted reserves of the fund are sufficiently reduced, the commission by rule or as other wise provided by law may increase the amount of the fee as provided in section 24-75-402 (4), C.R.S. 25-7-114.2. Construc tion perm its. No person shall construct or substantially alter any building , facility , structure, or installation, except single-family residential structures, or install any machine, equipment, or other device, or commence the conduct of any such activity , or commence performance of any combinations thereof, or commence operations of any of the same which will or do constitute a new stationary source or a new indirect air pollution source without first obtaining or having a valid construction permit therefor from the division or commission, as the case may be; except that no construction permit shall be required for new indirect air pollution sources until regulations regarding construction permits for such sources have been promulg ated by the commission, but in no event shall regulations governing indirect air pollution sources be more string ent than those required for complian ce with the federal act and final rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto . Any emission permit validly issued prior to July 1, 1992, pursuant to section 25-7-114, as said section existed prior to July 1, 1992, and in effect on or after July 1, 1992, shall be deemed to be a valid construction permit issued pursuan t to this section. The commissio n shall desig nate by regulation those classes of minor or insig nificant Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 448sources of air pollution which are exempt from the requirement for a permit because of their negligible impact on air quality . 25-7-114.3. Operating perm its required for emission of pollutants. (1) No person shall operate any of the following sources without first obtaining a renewable operating permit from the division for such source in a manner consistent with the requirements of this article and the federal act: (a) Any affected source; (b) Any major source; (c) Any source required to comply with standards of performance for new stationary sources under section 111 of the federal act, unless otherwise exempted from permitting requirements pursuant to federal rules adopted in accordance with section 502 of the federal act; (d) Any source subject to emission standards or regulations for hazardous air pollutants under section 112 of the federal act, unless otherwise exempted from federal permitting requirements pursuant to federal rules adopted in accordance with section 502 of the federal act; (e) Any source required to have a permit pursuant to part 2 (prevention of significant deterioration program) or part 3 (attainment program) of this article, or Part C (prevention of significant deterioration of air quality ) or Part D (plan requiremen ts for nonattainment area) of subchapter I of the federal act; (f) Any other source desig nated under federal law as requiring an operating permit. (2) For those sources located in the state and participating in the federal early reductions program as specified in section 112 (i) (5) of the federal act, or the United States environmental protection agency's 33/50 program, or the state early reductions program as set forth in subsection (3) of this section, or any of such programs, the commission and division shall establish a system to credit emission permit fees to be establish ed pursuant to sections 25-7- 114.6 and 25-7-114.7 and to be assessed against such sources at a ratio of at least two-for-one for every ton of emissions reduced pursuant to the federal early reductions program, the United States environmental protection agency's 33/50 program, or the state early reductions program. A participating source shall be offered a one-time permit fee credit of two tons for each corresponding ton of its reduced emissions that are verified by the division. The permit fee credit shall be available in the year following the year in which the early reduction in emissions is achieved. (3) The commission shall adopt the federal early reductions program specified in section 112 (i) (5) of the federal act and promulg ate a state early reductions program which shall include the following elements: (a) The state early reductions program shall be consistent with the federal early reductions prog ram; and (b) A six-year extension of compliance for existing sources with emission standards promulg ated pursuant to section 112 (d) of the federal act if the source has achieved an emission reduction of ninety percent or more of hazardous air pollutants (ninety -five percent or more for Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 449hazardous air pollutants which are particulates); and (c) If a source is granted a compliance extension, an alternative limitation to be established by permit to ensure continued achievement of the emission reduction; and (d) Sour ces subject to and in compliance with an enforceable commitment under the federal and state early reductions programs shall be considered in compliance with all state regulations and requirements for haz ardous air pollutants for the period of such commitment. (4) F or affected sources under Title V of the federal act: (a) Operating permits and requirements for permit applic ations, compliance plans, and monitori ng and reporting requirements shall be consistent with the provisions of Title IV as well as Title V of the federal act; (b) In order to ensure reliability of electric power, nothing in the requirements pertaining to renewable operating permits required by this article shall be construed as requiring termination of operatio ns of an electric utility steam generating unit for failure to have an approved permit or compliance plan; (c) Nothing in this article shall be construed as affecting SO2 allowances given to sources affected under Title I V of the federal act. 25-7-114.4. Permit applications - contents - rules. (1) The commi ssion shall promulg ate such regulations as may be necessary and proper for the orderly and effective administration of construction permits and renewable operating permits. Such regulations shall be in conformity with the provisions of this article and with federal requirements, shall be in furtherance of the policy contained in section 25-7-102, and shall implement, where applicabl e, permit and permit application contents, procedures, requirements, and restrictions with respect to the following : (a) Identification and address of the owner and operator of the source or facility from which the emission or emissions are to be permitted; (b) L ocation, quantity , and quality characteristics of the permitted emissions; (c) Inspection, monitoring , record-keeping , and reporting requirements consi stent with standard procedures, methods, and requirements established by the division; (d) Deadlines for submitting permit applications and compliance plans, which, for applications for renewable operating permits, shall be no later than twelve months after the source becomes subject to an approved permit program. Deadlines for submitting permi t applications for renewal of renewable operating permits shall be consistent with the requirements for filing such applications promulg ated under the federal act but in no event earlier than required under the federal act. (e) Contents of compliance plans to be submitted with renewable operating permit applications, which shall include schedules of compliance and progress reports at least every six months; (f) Annual certifications of facility compliance with permit requirem ents, with prompt reporting of deviations from permit requirements; (g) Submission of pertinent plans and specifications for the facility or source from which the emission is to be permitted; Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 450(h) Restrictions on transfers of the permit; (i) Procedures to be followed in the event of expansion or modification of the source or facility from which the emission occurs, or chang e in the quality , quantity , or frequency of the emission; (j) Duration of the permit and renewal procedures. The duration of construction permits shall be until the renewable operating permit is issued. The duration of renewable operating permits is five y ears. (k) Procedures to terminate, modify , or revoke and reissue permits for cause; procedures to revise permits, prior to renewal or termination, to incorporate applicable standards and regulations adopted after the issuance of such permit as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than eighteen months after promulg ation of the applicable requirement, or to incorporate otherwise applicable standards and reg ulations in the permit; ex cept that no such revision shall be required if the effective date of the standards or regulation occurs after the permit term expires, such revision shall be treated as a permit renewal, and the defense established under subsection (3) of this section shall apply until the permit amendment is complete; (l) Procedures for incorporating emission limitations and other requirements from an applicable implementation plan, and other applicable requirements, into new or renewed permits; (m) Procedures for notify ing other contig uous states whose air quality may be affected by the emissions or that are within fifty miles of the source and for submitting comments and recommendations reg arding the proposed permit; (n) Procedures for modify ing or amending permits, and procedures for authoriz ing any chang e within a permitted facility without requiring a permit revision, so long as any such chang e is not a modification under any provision of subchapter I of the federal act, and any such chang e does not exceed the emissions allowable under the permit, and advance notice is given to the division and the administrator. Such advance notice shall be no earlier than that required unde r regulations promulg ated pursuan t to the federal act. Failure of the division to respond by the day following the last day of such advance notice period allows the source to proceed with any such chang e. (o) Procedures to make available to the public any permit application, compliance plan, permit, and monitoring or compliance report, subject to the provisions of section 25-7-119 (4). If an applicant is required to submit information entitled to protec tion from disclosure, the applicant may submit such information separately . (p) Procedures for issuing general permits after notic e and an opportunity for hearing , covering numerous similar sources; (q) Procedures for issuing single permits for a facility with multiple sources; and (r) Requirements for permit applications, includ ing a standard application form and criteria for determining in a timely fashion the completeness of applications. (2) The division shall examine applications for and may issue, suspend, revoke, modify , deny , and otherwise administer all permits required unde r this article. Such administration shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article and regulations promulgated by the commission. (3) (a) Comp liance with all renewable operating permit terms and conditions shall be deemed compliance with section 25-7-114.3 and shall be deemed compliance with other Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 451applicable provisions of this article if: (I) The permit includes the applicable requirements of such provisions; or (II) The division or commission, in acting on the permit application, makes a determination that such other provisions are not applicable, and the permit includes the determination or a concise summary thereof. Such other provisions as are not applicable in each permit shall be identified upon the request of the permittee. (b) Nothing in parag raph (a) of this subsection (3) shall alter or affect: (I) The provisions of section 25-7-112 or 25-7-113 or section 303 of the federal act; (II) The liability of an owner or operator of a source for any violation of applicable requirements prior to or at the time of permit issuance. (4) For any permitted sand and gravel operation or crushed stone quarry or oil and gas well operation, if a breakdown of equipment or chang es in market condi tions require any additional crusher or screen or skid-mounted or glycol dehy drator to be broug ht onto a site, the air pollutant emission notice filed under section 25-7-114.1 shall also serve as an application for a permit under the provisions of this section to continue operations at such a site with alternative or additional equipment until such permit is issued stating emission limitations. 25-7-114.5. Application review - public participation. (1) Prior to submitting an application for a permit, the applicant may request and, if so requested, the division shall grant a planning meeting with the applicant. At such meeting , the division shall advise the applicant of the applicable permit requirements, including the information, plans, specifications, and data required to be furnished with the permit application. (2) The division shall evaluate permit applications to determine, for construction permits, whether operation of the proposed new source at the date of start-up and for operating permits, whether the permi tted emissions, will comply with all applicable emission control regulations, regulations for the control of haz ardous pollutants, and requirements of part 2 or 3 of this article. (3) The division shall also determine whether applications are for a new source activity that may have an impact upon areas which, as of the projected new source start-up date, are in compliance with national ambient air quality standards as of the date of the permit application, or for new source activity that may have an impact upon areas which, as of the projected new source start-up date, are not in compliance with national ambient air quality standards as of the date of the permit application. (4) The division shall prepare its preliminary analy sis regarding compliance, as set forth in subsection (2) of this section, and regarding the impact on attainme nt or nonattainment areas, as set forth in subsection (3) of this section, as expeditiously as possible. For construction permits not subject to part 2 of this article , such preliminary analy sis shall be completed no later than sixty calendar days after receipt of a complet ed permit application. Applicants must be advised within sixty calendar days after receipt of any application, or supplement thereto, if and in what respects the subject application is incomplete. Upon failure of the division to so notify the applicant within sixty calendar days of its filing, the application shall be deemed complete. Applications for construction permits subject to part 2 of this article shall be approved or disapproved within twelve months of receipt of a complete application. Appli cations for Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 452renewable operating permits shall be approved or disapproved within eighteen months after the receipt of the completed permit application; except that those applic ations submitted within the first year after the effective date of the operating permit program shall be subject to a phased schedule for acting on such permit applications established by the division. The phased schedule shall assure that at least one-third of such permits will be acted on by the division annually over a three-y ear period. The commission may establish a phased schedule for acting on applications for which a deferral has been granted pursuant to the federal act. A timely and complete permit application operates as a defense to enforcement action for operating without a permit for the period of time during which the division or the commission is reviewing the application and until such time as the division or the commission makes a final determination on the permit application; except that this defense to an enforcement action shall not be available to an applicant which files a fraudulent application. (5) For those types of projects or activities for which a construction permit application has been filed, defined, or desig nated by the commission as warranting public comment with respect thereto, the division shall , within fifteen calendar days after it has prepared its preliminary analy sis, give public notice of the proposed project or activity by at least one publication in a newspaper of general distributi on in the area in which the proposed project or activity, or a part thereof, is to be located or by such other method that is reasonably desig ned to ensure effective general public notice. The division shall also during such period of time maintain in the office of the county clerk and recorder of the county in which the proposed project or activity , or a part thereof, is located a copy of its preliminary analy sis and a copy of the application with all accompany ing data for public inspection. The division shall receive and consider public comment thereon for a period of thirty calendar day s thereafter. (6) (a) For any construction permit application subject to the requirements of a new or modified major source in a nonattainment area, or for prevention of significant deterioration as provided in part 2 of this article, or for any application for a renewable operating permit, within fifteen calendar day s after the issuance of its preliminary analy sis, the division shall: (I) Forward to the applicant written notice of the applicant' s right to a formal hearing before the commission with respect to the application; and (II) Give public notice of the proposed source or modification and the division' s preliminary analy sis thereof by at least one publication in a newspaper of general distribution in the area of the proposed source or modi fication, or by such other method that is reasonably desig ned to ensure effective general public notice. Such notice shall advise of the opportunity for a public hearing for interested perso ns to appear and submit written or oral comments to the commission on the air quality impacts of the source or modification, the alternatives to the source or modification, the control technolog y required, if applicable, and other appropriate considerations. Any such notice shall be printed prominently in at least ten-point bold-faced type. The division shall receive and consider any comments submitted. (b) If within thirty calendar days of publication of such public notice the applicant or an interested person submits a written request for a public hearing to the division, the division shall transmit such request to the commission along with the application, the division' s preliminar y analy sis, and any written comments received by the division, within five calendar days of the end of such thirty-day period. The commission shall, within sixty calendar days after receipt of the Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 453application, comments, and analy sis, unless such greater time is agreed to by the applicant and the division, hold a public hearing to elicit and record the comment of any interested person regarding the sufficiency of the preliminary analy sis and whether the permit application should be approved or denied. At least thirty calendar days prior to such public hearing , notice thereof shall be mailed by the commission to the applicant, printed in a newspaper of general distribution in the area of the proposed source or modific ation, and submitted for public review with the county clerk and recorder of the county wherein the project or activity is proposed. (7) (a) Within thirty calen dar days following the completion of the division' s preliminary analy sis for applications for construction permits not subjec t to part 2 of this article, or within thirty calendar days following the period for public comment provided for in subsection (5) of this section, or for applications for construction permits subject to part 2 of this article and for renewable operating permits, if a hearing is held, within the appropria te time period established pursuant to this article, the division or the commission, as the case may be, shall grant or deny the permit application. Any permit required pursuant to this article shall be granted by the division or the commission, as the case may be, if it finds that: (I) The source or activity will meet all applicable emission control regulations and regulations for the control of haz ardous air pollutants; (II) The source or activity will meet the requirements of part 2 or 3 of this article, if applicable; (III) For construction permits, the source or activity will meet any applicable ambient air quality standards and all applicable reg ulations; (III.5) For renewable operating permits, the source or activity will meet all applicable regulations; and (IV) For renewable operating permits, the United States environmental protection agency has not made a timely objection to issuance of such permit pursuant to the federal act. (b) Failure of the division or commission, as the case may be, to grant or deny the permit application or permit renewal application within the time prescribed shall be treated as a final permit action for purposes of obtaining judicial review in the district court in which the source is located, to require that action be taken on such application by the commission or divis ion, as appropriate, without additional delay . (c) If an applicant has submitted a timely and complete application for a renewable operating permit required by this article, including renewals, but final action has not been taken on such application, and, if required to have a construction permit, such construction permit is in place and valid, the source' s failure to have a renewable operating permit shall not be a violation of this article, unless the delay in final action was due to the failure of the applicant to timely submit information required or requested by the division to process the application. (8) If the division denies a permit or imposes conditions upon the issuance of a permi t which are contested by the applicant or if the division revokes a permit pursuant to subsection (12) of this section, the applicant may request a hearing before the commission. The hearing shall be held in accordance with sections 25-7-119 and 24-4-105, C.R.S. The commission may, after review of the evidence present ed at the hearing , affirm, reverse, or modify the decision of the division but shall, in any event, assure that all the requirements of subsections (6) and (7) of this section are met. Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 454(9) Renewable operating permits shall summariz e existing operating restrictions pursuant to section 25-7-114.4 (3). (10) A permit amendment will not be required to authoriz e a chang e in practice which is otherwise permitted pursuant to this article, the state implementation plan, or the federal act merely because an existing permit does not address the practice. Chang es in industrial practices and procedures that are not inconsistent with the terms of a renewable operating permit can be made without seeking any chang e to the terms of said permit. (11) An order of the division or commission shall be final upon issuance. Any participant in the public comment process and any other person who could obtain judicial review under applicable law shall have standing for purposes of seeking review of any final order of the commission or division regarding applications, renewals, or revisions of any permits. The public participation requirements of subsections (5) and (6) of this section shall apply to all renewable operating permit applications, revisions, and renewals. (12) (a) A permitted entity shall notify the division within fifteen days after the commenceme nt of any activity for which a construction permit has been issued. Within one hundred eighty days after commencement of operation for which a construction permit has been issued, the source shall demonstrate to the division compliance with the terms and conditions of the construction permit or the division may, pursuant to rules that are adopted by the commission based upon the results of the study conducted under section 25-7-114.7 (2) (a) (V), inspect the project or activity to determine whether or not the terms and conditions of the construction permit have been properly satisfied. At the end of one hundred eighty days after the commencement of operation, the division must: (I) Revoke the construction permit; or (II) Continue the construction permit, if applicable; or (III) Notify the owner or operator that the source has demonstrated compliance with the construction permit. (b) For those sources subje ct to the renewable operating permit program, a renewable operating permit will be issued within the appropriate time periods if all requirements for a renewable operating permit are met by the source. The construction permit requirements shall remain in effect until the renewable operating permit is issued. (12.5) (a) (I) Except for sources involved in agricultural, horticultural, or floricultural production such as farming , seasonal crop drying, animal feeding , or pesticide application, upon determination by the division that the criteria set forth in parag raph (b) of this subsection (12.5) applies to a source that is not required to obtain a renewable operating permit, the division may reopen such construction permit for the purpose of imposing any or all of the following additional terms and conditions: (A) Enhanced record-keeping requirements; (B) Enhanced emissions and ambient monitoring requirements; (C) Operating and maintenance requirements; and (D) Emission control requirements pursuant to section 25-7-109.3. (II) Any such condition which is conte sted by the permittee may be reviewed by the commission in accordance with the provisions of subsection (7) of this section. (b) With the exception of those sources involved in agricultural, horticultural, or Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 455floricultural production such as farming , seasonal crop drying, animal feeding , and pesticide application, a source' s construction permit may be reopened for cause for the purposes of parag raph (a) of this subsection (12.5) only upon a determination by the division that the location of the source is significant in terms of its proximity to residen tial or business areas, and one or more of the following criteria apply to the permitted source: (I) The control equipment utiliz ed by the source requires an unusually high degree of maintenance or operational sensitivity when compared to control equipment in g eneral; or (II) The design characteristics of the source require an unusually high degree of maintena nce or operational sensitivity when compared to the design characteristics of all sources in general; or (III) The application of the control equipment utiliz ed is unique or untested; or (IV) The operationa l variability of the source may impact the effectiveness of the controls; or (V) The emissions from the source will threaten public health, as determined pursuant to section 25-7-109.3. (c) Nothing in parag raph (a) or (b) of this subsection (12.5), as amende d by House Bill 05-1180, as enacted at the first regular session of the sixty-fifth general assembly , shall be construed as chang ing the property tax classif ication of property owned by a horticultural or floricultural operation. (13) The commission shall, wherever practicable, promulg ate regulations for renewable operating permit application requirements that combine requirements for construction permits with renewable operating permits to avoid duplicative efforts by the source and the division. (14) (Deleted by amendment, L. 2010, (HB 10-1042), ch. 209, p. 909, \u00a7 3, effective September 1, 2010.) (15) Repealed. (16) (a) If the division experiences a backlog in processing air quality permit applications caused by an occasional need that is seasonal, irregular, or fluctuating in nature, and the department determin es or reasonably expects that, as a result, permits would not be issued within statutory time frames, the division shall make available to sources that are not subject to permitting under part C of the federal act the option to have the air quality modeling that is submitted with the applicant' s air permit application reviewed for acceptance as demonstrating compliance by a contract consultant selected by the division in lieu of the review being conducted by division staff. (b) The division shall select and contract with nong overnmental air quality modeling engineers to perform air quality modeling reviews of applicants who choose contract consultant review of their air quality permit modeling . The division is not subject to the requirements of the \"Procurement Code\" , articles 101 to 112 of title 24, C.R.S., in selecting and contracting with the consultants. The division shall review and exclude from consideration as a contract air quality modeling consultant any contractors with a conflict of interest regarding air quality permit applications. Applicants that choose consultant review of their air quality modeling are responsible for both the consultant' s costs associated with the air modeling review as well as the division' s costs associated with the review and determina tion of the air permit application, to be paid to the division. The division shall transfer the money to the state treasurer, who shall credit Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 456it to the stationary sources control fund created in section 25-7-114.7 (2) (b) (I ). (c) The division shall use the results of the modeling conducted pursuant to parag raph (b) of this subsection (16) for purposes of the division' s permit application analy sis. 25-7-114.6. Emission notice - fees. (1) The commission shall designate by regulations those classes of minor or insignificant sources of air pollution which are exempt from the requirement for an emission notice or the payment of an emission notice filing fee because of their neg ligible impact upon air quality . (2) An air pollution emission notice shall be deemed to run with the land. The money s collected pursuant to this section and sections 25-7-403 and 25-7-510 shall be remitted to the state treasurer, who shall credit the same to the stationary sources control fund created in section 25-7-114.7 and subject to the provisions of said section. (3) The genera l assembly shall direct the commission to adjust any fees imposed by this section so that the revenues approximate the annual appropriations to the division to carry out its duties under this subsection (3) with respect to stationary sources. 25-7-114.7. Emission fees - fund. (1) As used in this section, unless the contex t otherwise requires: (a) I ndirect and direct costs include, but are not limited to: (I) Reviewing and acting upon any application for such a permit; (II) Implementing and enforcing the terms and conditions of any such permit (not including court costs or other leg al costs associated with any enforcement action); (III) Emissions and ambient monitoring ; (IV) Preparing generally applicable reg ulations or g uidance; (V) Modeling , analy ses, and demonstrations; (VI) Preparing inventories and tracking emissions; and (VII) Establishing and administering a small business stationary source technical and environmental compliance prog ram, pursuant to section 25-7-109.2. (b) (I ) \"Regulated pollutant\" means: (A) A volatile org anic compound; (B) Each pollutant reg ulated under section 25-7-109 or section 111 of the federal act; (C) Each pollutant reg ulated under section 112 (b) of the federal act; (D) Each pollutant for which a national primary ambient air quality standard has been promulg ated, ex cept for carbon monox ide; (II) The term \"regulated pollutant\" , for the purpose of assessing fees, shall not include fugitive dust or any fraction thereof. (2) (a) (I ) The commission shall desig nate by rule those classes of sources of air pollution that are exempt from the requirement to pay an annual emission fee. Every owner or operator of an air pollution source not otherw ise exempt in accordance with such commission rules shall pay an annual fee as follows: (A) For fiscal years 2008-09 and thereafter, twenty -two dollars and ninety cents per ton Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 457of regulated pollutant reported in the most recent air pollution emission notice on file with the division; (A.5) A late payment fee. Such fee shall be assessed at the rate of one percent per month for account s more than sixty days past due; except that no late payment fee may be assessed during a period in which an account is under administrative review by the division in order to respond to a reasonable request by the owner or operator of a source for allocat ion of the fees among multiple sources or to resolve a good-faith claim by the owner or operator of a source that there has been an error in calculation of the amount of fees due. At the end of the administrative review, the division shall inform the owner or operator of the source in writing of any finding s. (B) For fiscal years 2008-09 and thereafter, in addition to the annual fee set forth in sub- subparag raph (A) of this subparag raph (I), for hazardous air pollutants, including ozone- depleting compounds, an annual fee of one hundred fifty -two dollars and ninety cents per ton; (C) Every local air pollution control authority that adopts any air pollution resolution or ordinance that is more string ent than corresponding state provisions shall pay for the state' s enforcement costs; (II) In no event shall an owner or operator of a major source pay more than a fee based upon total annual emissions of four thousand tons of each reg ulated pollutant per source. (III) Every owner or operator subject to the requirements of paying fees set forth in subparag raph (I) of this parag raph (a) shall also pay a processing fee for the costs of processing any appli cation other than an air pollution emission notice under this article. Every significant user of prescribed fire, including federal facilities, submitting a planning document to the commission pursuant to section 25-7-106 (8) (b) shall pay a fee for costs of evaluating such documents. The division shall assess a fee for work it performs, up to a maximum of thirty hours at a rate of seventy -six dollars and forty -five cents per hour. If the division requires more than thirty hours to process the application or evaluate the prescribed fire-related planning documents, the fee paid by the applicant shall not exceed three thousan d dollars unless the division has informed the source that the respective billings may exceed three thousand dollars and has provided the source with an estimate of what the actual charg es may be prior to commencing the work. (IV) and (V) Repealed. (VI) Notwithstandi ng subparagraph (III) of this parag raph (a), the division shall not assess a fee for work performed to negotiate a voluntary agreement under part 12 of this article above a maximum of one hundred hours at a rate of fifty-nine dollars and ninety -eight cents per hour unless the owner or operator proposing the voluntary agreement consents to a greater fee in writing . (b) (I) The money s collected pursuant to this section shall be remitt ed to the state treasurer, who shall credit the same to the stationary sources control fund, which fund is hereby created. From such fund, the general assembly shall appropriate to the department of public health and environment, at least annually, such money s as may be necessary to cover the division' s direct and indirect costs required to develop and administer the programs established pursuant to parts 1 to 4 and 10 of this article for the control of air pollution from stationary sources. Any permit fee money s not appropriated by the general assembly and any appropriated funds not spent by the division shall remai n in the stationary sources control fund and shall not Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 458revert to the general fund of the state at the end of any fiscal year. Any such money s shall be separately accounted for. All interest earned on money s in the stationary sources control fund shall remain in the fund and shall not revert to the g eneral fund or to any other fund. (II) Of the portion of fee revenue attributable to the increases enacted during the first regular session of the sixty-third general assembly , the department shall allocate one hundred fifty thousand dollars per year for the purpose of moderniz ing and maintaining the computer system used for the administration of the stationa ry source program so as to make the overall system more efficient, and seventy thousand dollars for the purpose of enhancing county and district public health agency participation in air quality control activities. The department may reallocate money s between these two purpose s as reasonably necessary so long as the total amount devoted to such purposes remains at two hundred twenty thousand dollars annually .

For the purpose of addressing regional haze visibility impairment in Colorado' s mandatory class I federal areas, the federal land manag er of each such area shall develop a plan for evaluating visibility in that area by visual observation or other appropriate monitoring technique approved by the federal environmental protection agency and shall submit such plan for approval to the division for incorporation by the commission as part of the state implementation plan. Such submittal and compliance by the federal land manag ers shall be done in a manner and at a time so as to meet all present or future federal requirements for the protection of visibility in any mandatory class I feder al area. Such plan shall only be approved by the commission if the expense of implementing such a plan is borne by the federal g overnment. (b) (I) In addition to the plan submitted by each federal land manag er pursuant to parag raph (a) of this subsection (3), the responsible federal land manag ement agency shall provide an emission inventory to the commis sion of all federal land manag ement activities in Colorado or other states that result in the emission of criteria pollutants, including surrog ates or precursors for such pollutants, that affect any mandatory class I federal area in Colorado by reducing visibility in such an area. Such emission inventory shall be submitted to the commission no later than December 31, 2001, and no less frequently than every five y ears thereafter. (II) Each emission inventory submitted to the commission shall be subject to approval by the commission pursuant to section 25-7-105 (17). The commission shall exempt from the inventory requirement any sources or categories of sources that it determines to be of minor significance. (III) The commission shall adopt rules to fully implement the general assembly 's intention to exercise state powers to the maximum extent allowed under section 118 of the federal act in requiring each federal land manag ement agency with any presence in the state of Colorado to develop and submit to the division an inventory of emissions from lands, wherever situated, which could have any effect on visibility within mandatory class I federal areas located in Colorado. The commission and the divisio n shall use the information from these emission inventories: (A) To develop control strateg ies for reducing emissions within the state of Colorado as a primary component of the visibility long- term strateg ies for inclusion in the state implementation plan; (B) In any environment al impact statement or environmental assessment required to be performed under the federal \"National Environment al Policy Act of 1969\" , 42 U.S.C. secs. 4321 to 4347; and (C) To exercis e all powers and processes that exist to seek reductions in emissions outside the state of Colorado that reduce visibility in Colorado mandatory class I federal areas. (IV) The cost of preparing and submitting inventories pursuant to subparag raph (I ) of this parag raph (b) shall be borne by the federal g overnment. 25-7-213.

Attainm ent program . (1) The commission shall develop a program providing for the attainment and maintenance of each national ambient air quality standard in each nonattainment area of the state, in conformity with and as provided in Part D (Nonattainment Prog ram) of the federal act. (2) Subject to the requirement of subsection (1) of this section: (a) The attainment program shall be desig ned to account for and regulate all significant sources of air pollution, including stationary , mobile, and indirect sources, and shall assure that air quality benefits of the control measures utilized bear a reasonable relationship to economic, environmental, and energ y impacts and other costs of such measures; and (b) Control measures required pursuant to the attainment program shall take into consideration the respective contributions of different categ ories of sources to air pollution, existing control measures, and the availability and feasibility of additional control measures. 25-7-302. State implem entation plan - contents. The attainment program embodied in the state implementation plan may, with respect to proposed new or modified major stationary sources within nonattai nment areas which would cause or contribute to a violation of a national ambient air quality standard, provide an allowance for growth while providing reasonable further progress toward attainment, and new sources may be allowed that do not result, individually or in the aggregate, in emissions that exceed the allowance. Particulate matter not of a size or substance to adversel y affect public health or welfare shall not be considered in determining whether any applicable growth allowance has been consumed. Modifications to an existing facility within a source may be allowed which are accompanied by emission reduction offsets within the same source sufficient to provide no net increase in emissions of an air pollutant from the source. If an applicable growth allowance has been consumed, the attainment program shall permit sources to be constructe d only if emission reduction offsets providing a greater than one- for-one emission reduct ion are obtained from existing sources sufficient to provide reasonable further progress toward attaining the applicabl e national ambient air quality standards by the attainment date prescribed under Part D (Nonattainment Prog ram) of the federal act. Any emission offsets required for sulfur dioxide, particulates, and carbon monox ide shall provide a positive net air quality benefit in the area affected by the proposed source. 25-7-303. Exem ptions. (Repealed) Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 49425-7-304. Emission reduction offsets. The attainment program shall provide that emission reduction offsets which exceed those otherwise necessary to the granting of a permit under this part 3 may be preserved for sale or use in the futur e. Any emission reduction offset so preserved for future use and credit shall be specifically identifie d either in the state implementation plan or in the permit for the source as to which such offset was originally obtained. Any offsets so preserved and identifi ed shall not in any way be condemned or taken under the provisions of articles 1 to 7 of title 38, C.R.S. 25-7-305. Alternative emission reduction. The attainment program shall provide that upon application of the owner or operator of a stationary source, the commission may approve as a revision to the state implementation plan a proposal to meet the applicab le requirements of the state implementation plan for a given air pollutant for two or more facilities or operations within such source through a combination of different requirements which separately may be more or less string ent than the applicable requir ements of the state implementation plan; except that the total emissions from such facilities or operations shall not exceed the total emissions allowed by the applicable requirements of the state implementation plan. PART 4 CONTROL OF POL LUTION CAUSED B Y W OOD SMOKE 25-7-401. Legislative declaration. The general assembl y hereby declares that it is in the interest of the state to control, reduce, and prevent air pollution caused by wood smoke. It is therefore the intent of this part 4 to significantly reduce particulate and carbon monox ide emissions caused by burning wood by developin g an evaluation and certification program, in the department of public health and environment, for the sale of wood stoves in Colorado and by encourag ing the air quality control commission to continue efforts to educate the public about the effect s of wood smoke and the desirability of achieving reduced wood smoke emissions. The general assembly hereby finds that it is beneficial to the state to implement a program of voluntary no-burn days whenever the air quality control divisio n determines that the anticipated level of wood smoke will or is likely to have an adverse impact on the air quality in any nonattainment area in the state. 25-7-402. Def initions. As used in this part 4, unless the contex t otherwise requires: (1) \"Evaluate \" means to review wood-burning appliances' emission levels, as determined by an independent testing laboratory , and compare the emission levels to the emission performance standards established by the commission under section 25-7-403.

Voluntary no-burn days. Whenever the air quality control division determines, after investig ation, that the level of wood stove emissions anticipated will contribute adversely or is likely to have an adverse impact on the air quality in any nonattainment area in the state, the commission should implement and announce a prog ram of voluntary no-burn day s. 25-7-410 . Applicability. The provisions of this part 4 do not apply to a used wood stove and shall not apply to any fireplace constructed prior to the date established in section 25-7-407. 25-7-411. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that air pollution in the state of Colorado is a threat to the health and welfare of its citizens and that a major contributor to said pollution is wood smoke, which accounts for twenty - five to forty percent of the brown cloud, fifteen to thirty percent of small particulate matter, hereafter referred to as PM 10, up to ten percent of carbon monox ide, and a portion of toxic, cancer-causing chemicals. (2) The general assembly further finds, determines, and declares that PM 10 particulates created by wood burning threaten the public health in that said particulates are so small that they lodge in persons' lungs and inhibit the body's pulmonary function. Such pollutant is particularl y damag ing to persons with lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and chronic upper respiratory conditions, to the very young and elderly , and to pregnant women. The brown cloud is a threat to the economic health of the state because it discour ages businesses and tourists from coming to Colorado. Wood burning is one of the most easily controllable sources of air pollution. New technolog ies can dramatically reduce pollution caused by wood burning . In addition, the reduction of wood burning can reduce the amount of fine particulate emissions into the air. (3) Therefore, the general assembly finds that it is necessary to implement a plan to Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 498further reduce wood smoke emissions in the AIR program area and, therefore, enacts sections 25- 7-411 to 25-7-413 to encourag e and promote the reduction of wood-burning devices and the use of less polluting devices by taking advantag e of new technolog y. 25-7-412. Definitions. As used in sections 25-7-411 to 25-7-413, unless the contex t otherwise requires: (1) \"Fireplace insert\" means any wood-burning device desig ned to be installed in an existing fireplace which meets the Phase III standard, as such term is defined in subsection (2) of this section. (2) \"Phase III wood stove\" means any wood-burning device that meets the most string ent standards adop ted by the commission pursuant to section 25-7-106.3 (1) or any nonaffected wood-burning device that is approved by the commission. (3) \"Program area\" means the portions of the six counties in the AIR program area, including Adams, Arapahoe, B oulder, Denver, Doug las, and J efferson counties. 25-7-413. Methods for reducing wood smoke in program area. (1) Methods for reducing wood smoke in the prog ram area may be implemented, as follows: (a) Voluntary financia l incentives. The lead air quality planning agency for the Denver metropolitan area shall work with other organizations to establish a program of financial incentives to encourag e and defray the costs associated with conversions to Phase I II wood stoves or to g as or electric devices. The prog ram shall include incentives to use energ y efficient devices. (b) Educatio nal program. The lead air quality planning agency for the Denver metropo litan area shall work with public and private organizations to promote the following : The voluntary upgrade of conventional wood-burning stoves to Phase III stoves and the conversion of existing conventional fireplaces to fireplace inserts or to g as or electric devices; (c) Volu ntary conversions. (I) The commission shall establish goals for voluntary conversion of wood-burning units to cleaner burning technolog y to be met by December 31, 1994, and by December 31, 1997. The primary objective of the goals shall be to attain and maintain standards for particulate matter establish ed pursuant to the federal \"Clean Air Act\", taking into account other strateg ies adopted in the state implementation plan. The goals established by the commission may not ex ceed the following max imum levels: (A) The conversion or nonuse of one hundred thousand convention al wood-burning fireplaces to clean technolog y by December 31, 1994, and one hundred fifty thousand by December 31, 1997; (B) The conversion or nonuse of twenty thousand conventional wood stoves to Phase III wood stoves by December 31, 1994, and thirty thousand conversions by December 31, 1997. (II) The goals established pursuant to subparag raph (I) of this paragraph (c) may be less than the maximum levels if the commission determines that such nonuse or conversions are not necessary to attain and maintain federal particulate matter standards. (d) Contingenc y plan. (I) In the event that goals established in parag raph (c) of this Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 499subsection (1) are not met, or the commission determines that wood-burning controls are necessary to either attain or maintain the standards for particulate matter established pursuant to the 1990 amendments to the federal \"Clean Air Act\", taking into account other strateg ies, the commission shall develop and implement a conting ency plan. (II) Prior to the development of the conting ency plan, the commission shall contract with an independent contractor to conduct a random survey of the program area to determine public preferences for various wood smoke reduction strateg ies and shall hold a public hearing before adopting any recommendations concerning wood smoke reduction strateg ies, which recommendations shall be submitted to the g eneral assembly for action. (III) Strateg ies survey ed for public preference and considere d by the commission for inclusion in the conting ency plan shall include, but need not be limited to, the following : (A) Charg ing a fee for residents of dwelling s who wish to burn wood in a conventional stove or fireplace and using the fee for conversion incentives, enforcement of rules against burning wood without having paid a fee, and monitoring for compliance with rules; (B) Conversion to clean burning devices upon the sale of a dwelling unit containing a conventional fireplace or non-Phase I II wood stove; (C) Removal of the ex emption for primary heat sources on no-burn day s; (D) A permit-to-burn program with a maximum number of permits determined by the commission and issued in a random but proportional manner throug hout the prog ram area. (2) Verifying voluntary conversions. To measure and verify progress in regard to the provisions of subsection (1) of this section, the commission shall do the following : (a) The commission shall develop measures for obtaining from consumers in the program area pledg es not to use any device other than a Phase III wood stove, fireplace insert, or a gas or electric fireplace; and (b) The department of revenue shall adopt a procedure for tracking conversions of non- Phase III wood stoves and fireplaces and, if applicable, the number of non-Phase III wood stoves permanently destroy ed, which procedure shall include a requirement that retailers regularly submit to the commission the number of consu mer purchases of Phase III wood stoves or inserts or gas or electric fireplaces. (3) Wood smoke reduction fee - term ination. (a) On and after July 1, 1992, any retailer who sells a new wood stove or insert or a gas or electric fireplace or fireplace that uses a gas or electric device in the program area shall obtain from the purchaser a signed conversio n form, which form shall be provided by the department of revenue, or an entity with which the department is hereby authoriz ed to contract, affirming the purchase of such device and indicating whether the purchase is in connection with a conversi on to a cleaner burning device. In addition to obtaining the signed conversion form, the retailer shall submit to the department of revenue in accordance with parag raph (b) of this subsection (3) a fee in the amount of one dollar. (b) On and after J uly 1, 1992, and in accordance with parag raph (c) of this subsection (3), the retailer shall submit to the department of revenue the conversi on form along with the fee described in parag raph (a) of this subsection (3). The department of revenue shall transmit the fee to the state treasurer who shall credit the same to the wood smoke reduction fund, which fund is Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 500hereby created.

A transit option shall be considered a perquisite that is subject to the state controller' s fiscal rules controlling perquisites under section 24-30-202 (22), C.R.S. PART 10 AIR QUAL ITY REL ATED VAL UES - CL ASS I FEDERAL AREAS 25-7-1001. Legislative declaration. In order to establish a fair, practical, and cost- effective process for evaluating and, where appropriate, responding to assertions that air quality related values within Colorado' s class I federal areas are being significantly and adversely affected by air pollution, such as air pollution that is causing biolog ical harm, the general assembly hereby institutes the procedures set forth in this part 10. 25-7-1002. Air quality related values program . (1) In addition to maintaining a program that complies with the requirements of the federal act for prevention and remediation of significant deterioration of visibility in class I federal areas, the commission, in consultation with the general assembly , the governor, and affected federal, state, and local governmental entities, shall maintain a state-retained authority program in conformance with section 25-7-105.1 for nonvisibility air quality related values, referred to in this part 10 as the \" program\" . (2) The commission shall develop a prog ram under which, except for grant funds secured from other sources, the federal government undertakes the responsibility for the funding of air quality related value baseline data collection and the verification studies needed to substantiate an assertion of significant impairment, and the commission is encourag ed to conduct the activities specified in this part 10 in coordination with interested state and local governmental entities and affected citiz ens and businesses. 25-7-1003. Def initions. As used in this part 10: (1) \"Air quality related value (AQRV)\" means a feature or property of a class I federal area other than visibility that the state of Colorado finds may be affected by air pollution. General categ ories of air quality related values include odor, flora, fauna, soil, water, geolog ic features, and cultural resources. (2) \"Air quality related value baseline data\" means research data based on site-specific measurements and sampling s of air quality related values within a class I federal area needed to substantiate a determination of whether or not a particular observation is within the range of naturally occurring chang es or fluctuations. (3) \"Best available retrofit technolog y\" means a control strateg y for addressing emissions of a stationary source developed on a case-by -case basis after taking into consideration the costs of compliance, the energ y and nonair quality environm ental impacts of compliance, any existing Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 515pollutio n control technolog y in use at the source, the remaining useful life of the source, and the degree of improvement in the air quality related value that may reasonably be anticipated to result from the use of such technolog y. (4) \"Peer review\" means a review of scientific or technical information by a balanced objective panel of experienced scientists qualified to review the subject matter involved in verify ing the ex istence of or attributing the cause of an AQRV impairment. (5) \"Reaso nably available control measure\" means a control strateg y for addressing emissions of a nonstationary source developed on a case-by -case basis after taking into consideration the options available to achieve emission reductions that a particular source or sourc e category is capable of meeting as appropriate to an air quality related value if such steps may be feasibly and practicably taken considering technical and economic constraints. (6) \"Significant impairment of an air quality related value\" means a measurable chang e in an air quality related value that is outside the probabi lity of natural variability , that is caused by human activities, and that is causing a significant adverse effect to flora, fauna, soil, geolog ic features, cultural resources, or a beneficial use of water recog nized under Colorado law. 25-7-1004. Adm inistration of program by division. (1) In administering the program, the division shall: (a) Conduct or oversee program activities and scientific studies and determine an appropriate scope, sequence, and timetable for such studies and activities; (b) Subject assertions by a federal land manag er of air quality related value impairment in a class I federal area and studies concerning source attribution and source apportionment to peer review; (c) Utiliz e the study desig n and data collection and analy tical techniques set forth in section 25-7-211 that are relevant and appropriate to the activity or study ; (d) Assure that studies proceed as expeditiously as sound science will allow in order to minimiz e any delay in the process. (2) As necessary or appropriate, the division may : (a) Enter into memoranda of understand ing for participation in the studies and activities required by this part 10; (b) Create cooperative public-private partnerships with various entities; and (c) Perform any other appropriate activity to carry out the intent of the prog ram. (3) The division shall not be required to pay the cost of any studies that are discretionary as set forth in this part 10 other than as set forth in this section. If the division determines that an air quality related value of a class I federal area has the potential to be significantly threatened by air pollution, or is being impacted by air pollution, then the division shall apply for grants or act as a cataly st to secure financial support from available fundin g sources in federal, state, or local governments and private entities, to identify the threat by funding the necessary air quality related value baseline data colle ction, or to assist in remedy ing the threat by funding necessary attribution or apportionment studies. The division is also authoriz ed to act as a cataly st to secure financial support from other sources for such studies. The results of such studies and data collection shall be made available to the appropriate federal land manag er and interested Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 516members of the public to assist in the manag ement of these scenic resources and to cooperate in any needed air quality related values assessments. 25-7-1005. Verification of federal land manager's assertion of air quality related value impairm ent. (1) The federal land manag er of a class I federal area may initiate the procedures of this part 10 by submitting to the governor and division an assertion of significant impairment of an air quality related value, referred to in this part 10 as an \"assertion\" . To be adequate to support a verification of impairment, the assertion shall be supported by sufficient air quality related value baseline data and site-specific evidence of impairment. The assertion may be supp orted in part by information that concerns other areas with a similar environment to the class I federal area asserted to be impaired, provided such information is relevant to the class I federal area asserted to be impaired and sig nificant site-specific data is also available. (2) Upon receipt of an assertion, the division shall initiate the following actions concurrently : (a) Inform the commission at its next regularly scheduled monthly meeting of the receipt of an assertion, at which time the commission shall schedule the matter for a formal report from the division at the regular commission meeting that is scheduled to occur six months subsequent. All such informational briefing s and formal reports on the subject shall be noticed on the published ag enda of the commission. (b) Within sixty days of receipt of the assertion, the division shall convene a peer review panel to review the assertion, its supporting documentation, including the adequacy of the baseline data and the adequacy of the site-specific and other evidence of impair ment, and any other relevant information submitted to the division by the public. The requirement for peer review as specified in this parag raph (b) is waived with respect to any peer reviewer who has not submitted peer review comments within sixty days of the date on which the division certifies that the assertion, documentation, and other information has been transmitted to the individual peer reviewers. (c) Convene a consultation process that is open to the public in order to apprise the public and potentially affected sources and source categ ories of all stages of the program and to solicit the scientific, technical, economic, and manag erial views and assistance of the public and the potentially affected sources and source categ ories; and (d) Initiate a review by divisio n staff of the assertion and the supporting documentation submitted by the federal land manag er to assess whether the federal land manag er has demonstrated a significant impairment of an air quality related value in a class I federal area within Colorado. (3) At the commission meeting required by paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of this section , the division shall report to the commission. The division' s report shall include, but is not limited to, the conclusions of the peer review panel conce rning verification of the assertion and the division's determination of whether the federal land manag er has demonstrated a significant impairment of an air quality related value in a class I area within Colorado. If the division determines that the asser tion has not been verified, it shall so notify the commission and the federal land manag er of its finding s and the fact that the proceeding s authoriz ed under this part Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 51710 have been complete d. If the division determines that the assertion has been verified, it shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of section 25-7-1006. 25-7-1006. Source attribution and control strategy developm ent. (1) If the division determines that the assertion has been verified, it shall: (a) Compile a comprehensive inventory of the sources of the pollutants that are suspected to be causing the impairment; (b) Subject the development, conduct, and results of the attribut ion and apportionment studies to appropriate peer review; and (c) Perform attribution and apportionment studies to the extent feasible in order to develop for the division and the commission the identity and relative contribution of the significant contributors to air quality related value impairment, including , but not limited to, stationary sources, natural sources, wood smoke, agriculture, mining , roads, mobile source categ ories, and other area sources. The general assembly recog nizes that the ability to attribute the cause of air pollution effects and apportion the air pollution effects among sources and source categ ories identified by attribution studies is an area of evolving science. (2) (a) The funding of source attribution and apportionment studies shall be derived as provided in this subsection (2). Contributions to support the funding of such studies shall be requested from sources and source categ ories identified by the division as potentially contributing to the impairment. (b) If a potential contribution to impairment is identified from federal lands or state lands, the division shall request a funding contribution for such studies from the appropriate federal or state land manag er. (c) If a potential contribution to impa irment is identified from stationary sources or source categories, the division shall request a funding contributio n for such studies from such sources or source categ ories. (d) If a potential contribution to impairment is identified from mobile sources, the division shall seek an appropriation by the general assembly of excess funds in the AIR account in the hig hway users tax fund for funding contributions to such studies. (e) The division shall annually report to the legislative council on the adequacy of fundi ng derived pursuant to this subsection (2). If funding derived pursuant to this subsection (2) is inadequate, the leg islative council may recommend that the general assembly appropriate funds from available sources for purposes of this section. (3) Following its review and analy sis of the reasonable attribution and source apportionment studies and the reports thereon from the members of the peer review panel, the division shall identify those sources and source categ ories within the state and region significantly contributing to air quality related value impairment. (4) The division shall identify the sources and source categories significantly contributing to air quality related value impairment that are located outside the state and report this list to the commission, governor, and general assembly for their consideration in identify ing options for remedy ing such impacts. (5) The division shall issue an order to the sources and source categ ories significantly Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 518contributing to air quality related value impairment located within the state that have not made a voluntary enforceable commitment under section 25-7-1008. (6) (a) An order issued pursuant to subsection (5) of this section shall require: (I) Such sources and source categ ories to submit a report within a reasonable period of time; (II) A stationary source to identify the best available retrofit technolog y; and (III) Other sources and source categ ories to identify reasonably available control measures. (b) After considering the responses to an order issued pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, the division shall issue a public report to the comm ission concerning its recommendations on air quality related value impairment, source attribution, source apportionment, and control strateg y options. 25-7-1007. Commission to consider control strategies in rule-m aking proceeding. (1) Upon receipt of a report under section 25-7-1006 (6) (b) from the division , and after the division has made the report available to all significant source or source categ ories identified pursuant to section 25-7-1006, the commission shall give notice that it is to conduct a rule-making hearing concerning the implementation of control strateg ies recommended in the report. (2) In addition to other applicable rule-making provisio ns, the rule-making hearing shall be conducted: (a) I n reasonable prox imity to the affected class I federal area; (b) To allow sufficient time for comment and testimony by all interested persons; and (c) To allow reasonable discovery pursuant to section 24-4-103 (13) and (14), C.R.S. (3) (a) The commission shall order by rule implementation within a reasonable time of a practical and cost-effective control strateg y or strateg ies that will provide reasonable progress toward remedy ing the impairment, if the commission finds that: (I) The evidence in the record shows the existence of a significant impairment of an air quality related value in a class I federal area; (II) An ident ifiable source or source categ ory is responsible for significantly causing or contributing to the impairment; (III) The best available retrofit technolog y exists for any such stationary source; (IV) Reasonably available control measures exist for any such other sources or source categ ories; (V) Implementation of the contro l strategies would make significant improvement in the impairment; (VI) Taking into accou nt that the ability to attribute the cause of air pollution effects and to apportion the air pollution effects among sources and source categories identified by attribution studies is an area of evolving science, a correlation of the extent of improvement in air quality related value impairment can reasonably be expected to result from imposition of a control strateg y or strateg ies for each significant source or source categ ory identified by the division. Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 519(b) Within fourteen days after having received the division's report under section 25-7- 1006 (6) (b), a source or source categ ory may petition the commission, as part of its rule-making hearing conducted pursuant to this subsection (3), to make a determination that the benefits of phasing, segmenting , or excusing the control strateg y or strateg ies outweig h the bene fits of imposing the control strateg y or strateg ies. In making such determination, the commission shall consider all economic and related costs associated with the implementation of the control strateg y or strateg ies involving the source or source categ ory. The burden of proof shall be on the petitioner. 25-7-1008. Voluntary agreem ents. (1) The division may convene, at any appropriate time, an informal voluntary negotiation process, with appropriate public participation, to seek voluntary enforceable commitments from sources and source categ ories to achieve emissions reductions sufficient to make reasonable further progress in reducing any portion of the impairment. (2) A voluntary enforceabl e commitment becomes enforceable throug h a commission rule, local ordinance or resolution, judicially enforceable consent decree, or division permit condition, as appropriate to the circumstances. (3) If subsequent to January 15, 1996, a source or source category agrees to an enforceable commitment to adopt a control strateg y that the division determines is as effective or is more effective than best available retrofit technolog y for stationary sources or reasonably available contr ol measures for nonstationary sources, the division shall exempt that source or source categ ory from the imposition of further controls pursuant to this part 10 for a period of ten years from the date established for achieving the emission reductions as specified in the voluntary enforceable ag reement. (4) If subsequent to January 15, 1996, and prior to January 15, 1998, a source or source categ ory agrees to an enforceable commitment contained in a judicially enforceable consent decree to adopt a control strateg y that the division determines provides both for reasonable progress toward the national visibility goal under 40 CFR Part 51, Subpart P and 5 CCR 1001-4 and for reasona ble progress in reducing any present or future impairment of an air quality related value, the division shall exempt that sourc e or source categ ory from the imposition of further contr ols pursuant to this part 10 for a period of ten years from the date established for achieving the emission reductions as specified in the judicially enforceable consent decree. The provisions of section 25-7-133 shall not apply to that portion of an amendment to the visibility component of the state implementation plan that implements and enforces the control strateg y covered by this subsection (4). (5) If a source or source categ ory agrees to an enforceable commitment to adopt a control strateg y that the division determines is not as effective as best available retrofit technolog y for stationary sources or reasonably available control measures for nonstationary sources but that the division determines will assist in making reasonable further progress in reducing impairment of an air quality related value, the commission may, after public hearing, exempt that source or source categ ory from the imposition of further controls pursuant to this part 10 with respect to those pollutants that the source or source categ ory has agreed to control for a period of up to ten Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 520years from the date established for achieving the emission reductions as specified in the voluntary enforceable ag reement. (6) A source that, prior to June 1, 1996, has received a permit under the federal prevention of significant deterior ation program, 42 U.S.C. secs. 7470 to 7479 or sections 25-7- 201 to 25-7-210, and installed pollution control measures comparable to the best available control technolog y pursuant to that program shall not be required to install additional control measures pursuant to this part 10 for a period of ten years from J une 1, 1996, but may be required to operate pollution control equipment to its maximum efficiency . This section shall not apply to any source that is not subject to compliance with the requirements of 42 U.S.C. sec. 7651 (f), which establishes schedules and emission limitations for the control of nitrog en oxide emissions from certain stationary sources. Nothing in this subsection (6) shall be construed to modify the terms of any perm it applicable to such source or excuse compliance with respect to any other requirement under this article or the federal act. Except for the exemption for a period of ten years provided in this subsection (6), nothing in this subsection (6) shall excuse such sources from responding to reasonable reque sts by the division for information required to complete inventories and attribution and apportionment studies. PART 11 LEAD-B ASED PAI NT AB ATEMENT 25-7-1101. Legislative declaration. (1) The g eneral assembly hereby declares that: (a) Exposure of children to lead represents a significant environmental health problem that is preventable; (b) According to the federal \"Residential Lead-based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of secs. 2682 and 2684, et seq., as amended, home buyers and renters must be properly informed of the risks of lead exposure to children, especially children under seven years of ag e; (c) Trained and qualified individuals are needed in order to advise consumers about lead hazards in g eneral and about specific measures that may be needed to control such haz ards; and (d) The state seeks to adopt the concept of \"lead-safe\" housing units and child-occupied facilities, rather than \"lead-free\" housing and facilities. The goal of the state should not be the removal of all lead-based paint, but the creation of housing and facilities where no significant lead-based paint hazard is present. This goal includes the removal, enclosure, or encapsulation of lead-based paint to remove lead haz ards from targ et housing and child-occupied facilities. (2) The g eneral assembly declares that the enforcement of the lead-based paint abatement standards may be deleg ated to local health and building departments in Colorado. (3) Therefore, the general assembly determines and declares that the enactment of this part 11 is a matter of statewide concern to achieve uniformity in the regulation of lead abatement practices and uniformity in the qualifications for and certificat ion of persons who perform such abatement.

Applicability of article - child-occupied facilities and target housing. Nothing in this article shall be interpreted to affect any facility or location other than a child-occupied facility or targ et housing . PART 12 VOL UNTARY EMI SSION L IMITATI ONS 25-7-1201. Legislative declaration. The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that voluntary emission limitations are an effective and efficient way to reduce emissions of air pollutants. However, the uncertainty of future control requirements impedes an owner or operator of a stationary source or group of stationary sources from making the inves tments necessary to voluntarily reduce emissions. The department of public health and environment should encourag e all owners and operators of stationa ry sources or groups of stationary sources to voluntarily reduce emissions by providing, to the extent possible, certainty with respect to future control requirements. 25-7-1202. Definitions. The definitions contained in section 25-7-103 shall apply to this part 12. I n addition, the following definitions shall apply to this part 12: Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 524(1) \"Actual emissio ns\" means the averag e amount of emissions, calculated in tons per year, that the stationary source or group of stationary sources emitted during the three-y ear period immediately prior to the date the proposed voluntary agreement was submitted to the divisio n for review so long as the three-y ear time period is representative of normal unit operation. A different time period may be used to calculate actual emissions if such time period is more representative of normal unit operation than the three-y ear period immediately prior to the date the proposed voluntary agreement was submitted to the division. (2) \"Actual emission rate\" means the averag e rate of emissions, calculate d in pounds per million BTU or a comparable measure of the mass of emissions per unit of production, that the stationary source or group of stationary sources emitted during the three-y ear period immediately prior to the date the proposed voluntary agreement was submitted to the division for review so long as the three-y ear time period is representative of normal unit operation. A different time period may be used to calculate the actual emission rate if such time period is more representative of normal unit operation than the three-year period immediately prior to the date the proposed voluntary agreement was submitted to the division. 25-7-1203. Voluntary agreem ents. (1) The owner or operator of any stationary source or group of stationary sources may obtain regulatory assurance, as described in section 25-7- 1204, by entering into a voluntary agreement pursuant to this part 12. The parties to the proposed voluntary agreement shall negotiate in good faith to reach a volunta ry agreement as expeditiously as possible. The owner or operator shall provide the division with any information necessary to evaluate the terms and conditions of the proposed voluntary agreem ent. The parties to the proposed voluntary agreement shall structure the emission limitations or emission reductions contained in a voluntary agreement so as to minimiz e costs and maximize the operational flexibility avail able to the owner or operator of the stationary source or group of stationary sources by using, among other thing s, numeric emission limits, annual emission limits, or emissions averag ing across several emission points or sources, as appropriate. (2) The division shall evaluate the emission limitations contain ed in a proposed voluntary agreement to determine whether they will result in reductions in actual emissions or actual emissio n rates, will result in emission reductions earlier than would be required by existing laws or regulations, will result in emission reductions significantly greater than required by existing laws or regulations, and will protect human health or the environment. The division shall also evaluate the assur ance period proposed in the voluntary agreement based on the following factors: (a) The environmental benefits of the emission limitations and their sig nificance; (b) The time necessary to achieve the emission limitations; (c) The capital, operating , and other costs associate d with achieving the emission limitations; and (d) The energ y impacts and environmental impacts not related to air quality of achieving the emission limitations. (3) After conducting the evaluation required in subsection (2) of this section, the division Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 525may reject any proposed voluntary agreement that does not meet the requirements of this section. If the division rejects the proposed voluntary agreemen t, the owner or operator of the stationary source or group of stationary sources may petition the comm ission for review of the proposed voluntary agreement and the division' s rejection thereof in accordance with the rules promulg ated by the commission. (4) If the division finds that the emission limitations and the assurance period proposed in a voluntary agreement meet the requirements of this section, the division shall submit the proposed voluntary agreement to the commission for approval. The commission shall provide the public with notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed voluntary agreement. The commission shall act upon the voluntary agreement as ex peditiously as possible. The commission shall approve the voluntary agreement unless it finds by substantial evidence that the proposed voluntary agreement is inconsistent with the requirements of this part 12. In no event shall the commission adopt emission limitations or an assurance period different than proposed in the voluntary agreement without the express written approval of the owner or operator of the stationary source or g roup of stationary sources subject to the ag reement. (5) If the commission approves the proposed voluntary agreement, the emission limitations and other provisions contained in the voluntary agreement shall be enforceable under this article against the stationary source or group of stationary sources in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in the voluntary agreement. Such enforcement may include any appropriate mechanism, including rule, permit condition, or consent order. (6) No voluntary agreement or the underly ing emission limitations under subsection (1) of this section shall be made federally enforceable without the written consent of the owner or operator of the stationary source or g roup of stationary sources. (7) Except as provided in this part 12 or other applicable law, no voluntary agreement entered into under this part 12 shall alter any existing federal or state requirement otherwise applicable to the stationary source or g roup of stationary sources subject to such ag reement. (8) The commission may adop t any rules, procedures, or combination thereof necessary to implement this part 12. Notwithstanding this authority , the division may negotiate and evaluate proposed voluntary agreements, and the commission may approve proposed voluntary agreements and review the division' s rejection of a proposed voluntary agreement as of July 1, 1998. 25-7-1204.

Such methods may include but are not limited to burning low-sulfur coal, reducing the operation of units, retiring units, and chang ing fuels. If such methods are included in a voluntary agreement, the agreement shall include the procedure by which the division shall calculate the emission reductions to be obtained by such methods. (2) It is the intent of the general assem bly that the commission should consider any coal- fired power plant or power plants located within the same airshed that are achieving the emission limitations described in this section under a voluntary agreement to be in compliance with any emission limitation that is based on a technolog y requirement in the federal act. Such consideration should continue for a period of fifteen years after the date established in the voluntary agreement for achieving the emission limitations that are contained in the voluntary agreement. During the fifteen-y ear period, the commission, by rule, may require the coal-fired power plant to meet a different emission limitation based on a technolog y requirement in the federal act if: (a) The commission finds that a different emission limitation is necessary to comply with the federal act; and (b) The owner or operator of the coal-fired powe r plant is not required to begin installation of the required emission control technolog y unless and until the general assembl y has acted to postpone the expiration of the commission's rule in accordance with section 24-4-103, C.R.S. (3) The general assembly further intends that nothing in subsection (2) of this sectio n shall be construed to create a precedent for the application or interpretation of either the \"Colorado Air Pollution Prevention and Control Act\", article 7 of title 25, C.R.S., or the federal act in any circumstance other than the execution of voluntary agreements between the state of Colorado and the owners and operators of coal-fired power plant s in accordance with this part 12.

(4) I n promulg ating water quality standards, the commission shall consider: (a) The need for standards which reg ulate specified pollutants; (b) Such information as may be available to the commission as to the degree to which any particular type of pollutant is subject to treatment; the availability , practicality , and technical and economic feasibility of treatment techniques; the impact of treatment requirements upon water quantity ; and the ex tent to which the discharg e to be controlled is sig nificant; (c) The continuous, intermittent, or seasonal nature of the pollutant to be controlled; (d) The existing extent of pollution or the maximum extent of pollution to be tolerated as a goal; (e) W hether the pollutant arises from natural sources; (f) B eneficial uses of water; and (g) Such information as may be available to the commission reg arding the risk associated with the pollutants including its persistence, degradability , the usual or potentia l presence of the affected organism in any waters, the importanc e of the affected organisms, and the nature and extent of the effect of the po llutant on such org anisms. (5) In establishing water quality standa rds using statistical methodolog ies or in requiring the use of statistical method ologies for permit or enforcement purposes, statistical methodolog ies used must be based on assumptions that are compatible with the water quality data. (6) For the purpose of implementing section 303(c)(2)(B ) of the federal act, the commission may adopt numerical water quality standards for toxic pollutants listed pursuant to section 307(a)(1) of the federal act for which criteria have been published under section 304(a) of the federal act, and these standards may be applied in accordance with this article to discharg es of pollutants to specified portions or segments of surface waters where such pollutants may be discharg ed or are present in the affected surface waters and could reasonably be expected to interfere with classified uses. Monitoring requirements for discharg es of such pollutants shall be reasonably related to the potential for the presence of such pollutants in the discharg e at levels inconsistent with water quality standards and shall be imposed to the maximum extent practical on those responsible for the presence of the pollutants. This subsection (6) does not in any way limit the commission' s authority to adopt water quality standards in order to comply with provisions of the federal act. (7) If, after full application of publicly owned treatment work authority pursuant to section 307(b)(1) of the federal act, stream standards or effluent limitations established pursuant to subsection (6) of this section are exceeded as a result of a discharg e from a publicly owned treatment work, the commission, upon request of a publicly owned treatment work, shall conduct a public hearing to investig ate the source of pollution causing such ex ceedance. 25-8-205. Control regulations. (1) The commission may promulg ate control regulations for the following purposes: Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 545(a) To describe prohibitions, standards, concent rations, and effluent limitations on the extent of specifically identified pollutants, including , but not limited to, those mentioned in section 25-8-204, that any person may discharg e into any specified class of state waters; (b) To describe pretreatment requirements, prohibitions, standar ds, concentrations, and effluent limitations on wastes any person may discharg e into any specified class of state water from any specified type of facility , process, activity , or waste pile including , but not limited to, all ty pes specified in section 306 (b) (1) (A) of the federal act; (c) To describe precautionary measures, both mandatory and prohibitory , that must be taken by any person owning , operating , conducting , or maintaining any facility , process, activity, or waste pile that does cause or could reasonably be expected to cause pollution of any state waters in violation of control regulations or that does cause the quality of any state waters to be in violation of any applicable water quality standard; (d) To adopt toxic effluent standards and pretreatment standards for pollutants which interfere with, pass throug h, or are otherwise incompatible with sewag e treatment works; (e) To describe requirements, prohibitions , standards, and concentration limitations on the use and disposal of biosolids to protect public health and to prevent the discharg e of pollutants into state waters, except as authoriz ed by permit. The commission requirements described pursuant to this paragraph (e) shall be no more restrictive than the requirements adopted for solid wastes disposal sites and facilities pursuant to part 1 of article 20 of title 30, C.R.S., except as necessary to be consistent with section 405 of the federal act. Fees shall be establ ished as set forth in section 30-20-110.5, C.R.S., and the commission shall have no authority to levy additional or duplicative fees.

The city , city and county , or county that has adopted an ordinance or resolution approving the use of graywater pursuant to section 30-11-107 (1) (kk) or 31-15-601 (1) (m), C.R.S., has exclusive enforcement authority regarding compliance with the ordinance or resolution. (III) Use of graywater shall be allowed only in accorda nce with the terms and conditions of the decrees, contracts, and well permits applicable to the use of the source water rights or source water and any return flows therefrom, and no use of g raywater shall be allowed that would not be allowed under such decrees, contracts, or permits if the graywater ordinance or resolution did not ex ist. (IV) A local city, city and county , or county may only authoriz e the use of graywater in accordance with federal, state, and local requirements. (2) In the formulation of each control regulation, the commission shall consider the following : Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 546(a) The need for regulations that control discharg es of specified pollutants that are the subject of water quality standards for the receiving state waters; (b) The need for regulations that specify treatment requirements for various types of discharg es; (c) The degree to which any particular type of discharge is subject to treatment, the availability, practicality , and technical and economic feasibility of treatment techniques, and the extent to which the discharg e to be controlled is sig nificant; (d) Control requirements promulg ated by agencies of the federal g overnment; (e) The continuous, intermittent, or seasonal nature of the discharg e to be controlled; (f) Whether a regulation that is to be applicable to discharg es into flowing water should be written in such a way that the degree of pollution tolerated or treatment required will be dependent upon the volume of flow of the receiving water or the extent to which the discharg e is diluted therein, or the capacity of the receiving water to assimilate the discharg e; and (g) The need for specification of safety precautions that should be taken to protect water quality including , but not limite d to, requirements for the keeping of logs and other records, requirements to protect subsurface waters in connection with mining and the drilling and operation of wells, and requirements as to settling ponds, holding tanks, and other treatment facilities for water that will or mig ht enter state waters. (3) Control regulations may be promulg ated for use in connection with any one or more of the classes of state waters authoriz ed pursuant to section 25-8-203 and may be made applicable with respect to any desig nated portion of state waters or to all state waters. (4) The commission shall coordinate and cooperate with the state engineer, the Colorado water conse rvation board, the oil and gas conservation commission, the state board of health, and other state agencies having regulatory powers in order to avoid adopting control regulations that would be either redundant or unnecessary . (5) The commis sion shall not adopt control regulations that require agricultural nonpoint source discharg ers to utiliz e treatment techniques that require additional consumptive or evaporative use which would cause material injury to water rights. With regard to nonpoint source water pollution control related to agricultural practices, the commission and division shall pursue incentive, grant, and cooperative programs in preference to the promulg ation of control regulations. When interested water conservation districts, water conservancy districts, and conservation districts recommend nonpoi nt source control activities related to agricultural practices to the division and commission, the division and commission, after consultation with such districts, shall give substantial weig ht to the recomm endations of such districts into the approved program. Except as provided by section 25-8-205.5, control regulations related to agricultural practices shall be promulgated only if incentive, grant, and cooperative programs are determined by the commission to be inadequate and such regulations are necessary to meet state law or the federal act. This subsection (5) does not allocate wasteloads or relieve any source from participation in wasteload allocations determined necessary under any duly promulg ated regulations established by the water quality control commission under this section. (6) The division may issue a variance from a control regulation of general applicability , based upon a determination that the benefits derived from meeting the control regulation do not bear a reasonable relationship to the econo mic, environmental, or energy impacts or other factors Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 547which are particular to the applicant in comply ing with the control regulation; except that such variance shall be consisten t with the purposes of this article including the protection of existing beneficial uses. No variance shall be issued for longer than five years. Variances shall be granted or renewed according to the procedure established in section 25-8-401 (5). 25-8-205.5.

(c) Such stay shall be granted by the court if there is probable cause to believe that refusal to g rant a stay will cause serious harm to the affected person or any other person, and: (I) That the alleg ed violation or activity to which the order or determination pertains will not continue, or if it does continue, any harmful effects on state waters will be alleviated promptly after the cessation of the violation or activity ; or (II) That the refusal to grant a stay would be without sufficient corresponding public benefit. (5) Any party may move the court to remand the case to the division or the commission in the interests of justice, for the purpose of adducing additional specified and material evidence, and finding s thereon; but such party shall show reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence previously before the division or the commission. (6) If the court does not stay the effectiveness of an order of the commission or division, the court shall enforce compliance with that order by issuing a temporary restraining order or injunction at the request of the commission or division. 25-8-405. Sam ples - secret processes. (1) If samples of water or water pollu tants are Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 560taken for analysis, the person believed to be responsible for any suspected violation or who is or will be subject to any remedial action shall be notified immediately of the collection of the samples and a representativ e portion of the sample shall be furnished immediately upon request to said person. A representative portion of such sample shall be furnished to any suspected violator whenever any remedial action is taken with respect thereto by the division. A duplicate of every analytical report pertaining to such sample shall also be furnished as soon as practicable to such person. Any request for a sample split shall be made within six months of the notification of the collection of samples. (2) Any infor mation relating to any secret process, method of manufacture or production, or sales or marketing data which may be acquired, ascerta ined, or discovered, whether in any sampling investig ation, emerg ency investig ation, or otherwise, shall not be publicly disclosed by any member, officer, or employ ee of the commission or the division, but shall be kept confidential. Any person seeking to invoke the protection of this subsection (2) shall bear the burden of proving its applicability .

PART 5 PERMI T SYSTEM 25-8-501. Permits required for discharge of pollutants - adm inistration. (1) No person shall discha rge any pollutant into any state water from a point source without first having obtained a permit from the division for such discharge, and no person shall discharg e into a ditch or man-made convey ance for the purpose of evading the requirement to obtain a permit under this article. No person covered by this article shall use or dispose of biosolids, except as authoriz ed by regulations that shall not be more restrictive than the requirements adopted for solid wastes disposal sites and facilities pursuant to part 1 of article 20 of title 30, C.R.S., except as necessary to be consistent with section 405 of the federal act. Existing authoriz ation for the use or disposal of biosolids shall continue until permits are issued in accordance with this part 5. Each application for a permit duly filed under the federal act shall be deemed to be a permit Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 561application filed under this article, and each permit issued pursuant to the federal act shall be deemed to be a temporary permit issued under this article which shall expire upon expiration of the federal permit. (2) The division shall examine applications for and may issue, suspend, revoke, modify , deny , and otherwise administer permits for the discharge of pollutants into state waters and for the use and disposal of biosolids. Such administration shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article and regulatio ns promulg ated by the commission. Until modified pursuant to this article, final permits shall be g overned by their ex isting limitations. (3) The commission shall promulg ate such regulations as may be necessary and proper for the orderly and effective administration of permits for the discharg e of pollutants, which regulations shall include, but not be limited to, procedures for the issuan ce of a variance pursuant to section 25-8-503 (4), and shall also require that, in appropriate circumstances, the effluent limitations contained in a permit shall be adjusted to account for the pollutants contained in the discharg er's intake water. Such regulations shall be consistent with the provisions of this article and with federal requirements and shall be in furtherance of the policy contained in section 25-8- 102. Such regulations shall establish a permit process that allows permit conditions to remain in effect as long as circumstances dictate those conditions. In order to comply with federal requirements, but not to lessen compliance with federal stand ards, such permit process may require periodic renewal of permits even where minimal or no chang es in the permit conditions are necessary. Renewal shall be required where more than minimal chang es in permit conditions are necessary . The regulations may pertain to and implement, among other matters, permit and permit application contents, procedures, requirements, and restrictions with respect to the following : (a) Identification and address of the owner and operator of the activity , facility , or process from which the discharg e is to be permitted; (b) L ocation and quantity and quality characteristics of the permitted discharg e; (c) Effluent limitations and conditions for treatment prior to discharg e to a publicly owned treatment works; (d) Monitoring as well as record-keeping and reporting require ments consistent with standard procedures and methods established by the division; (e) Schedules of compliance; (f) Procedures to be followed by division personnel for entering and inspecting premises; (g) Submis sion of pertinent plans and specifications for the facility , process, or activity which is the source of a waste discharg e; (h) Restrictions on transfers of the permit; (i) Procedures to be followed in the event of expansion or modification of the process, facility, or activity from which the discharg e occurs or the quality , quantity , or frequency of the discharg e; (j) Duration of the permit and renewal procedures using a risk-based approach that limits the amount of work required to renew permits that have minimal or no chang es in the permit conditions to streamline the renewal process; (k) Authority of the division to require chang es in plans and specifications for control facilities as a condition for the issuance of a permit; Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 562(l) Identification of control regulations over which the permit takes precedence and identification of control reg ulations over which a permit may never take precedence; (m) Notice requirements of any intent to construct, install, or alter any process, facility , or activity that is likely to result in a new or altered discharg e; (n) Effectiveness under this article of permit applications submitted to and permits issued by the federal g overnment under the federal act. (4) Nothing in any permit shall ever be construed to prevent or limit the application of any emerg ency power of the division. (5) Every permit issued for a domestic wastewater treatment works shall contain such terms and conditions as the division determines to be necessary or desirable to assure continuing compliance with applicable control regulations. Such terms and conditions may require that whenever deemed necessary by the division to assure such compliance the permittee shall: (a) Require pretreatment of effluent from industrial, governmental, or commercial facilities, processes, and activities before such effluent is received into the gathering and collection sy stem of the permittee; (b) Prohibit any connection to any municipal permittee' s interceptors and collection system that would result in receipt by such municipal permittee of any effluent other than sewag e required by law to be received by such permittee; (c) Include specified terms and conditions of its permit in all contra cts for receipt by the permittee of any effluent not required to be received by a municipal permittee; (d) Initiate engineering and financial planning for expansion of the domestic wastewater treatment works whenever throug hput and treatment reaches eig hty percent of desig n capacity ; (e) Commence construction of such domestic wastewa ter treatment works expansion whenever throug hput and treatment reaches ninety -five percent of desig n capacity or, in the case of a municipality , either commence such construction or cease issuance of building permits within such municipality until such construction is commenced; ex cept that building permits may continue to be issued for any construction which would not have the effect of increasing the input of domestic wastewater to the sewag e treatment works of the municipality involved. The term \"commen ce construction\" , as used in this parag raph (e), includes execution of, and commencement of work under, contracts for engineering desig n, plans, and specifications for erection, building , alteration, remodeling , improve ment, or extension of treatment works and commitment to the completion of construction of such treatment works prior to exceeding permit effluent limitations based upon facility desig n and capacity or execution of a contract for the construction thereof. (6) Inclusion of the requi rements authoriz ed by parag raph (d) of subsection (5) of this section shall be presumed unnecessary to assure compliance upon a showing that the area served by a domestic wastewater treatment works has a stable or declining population; but this provision shall not be construed as preventing periodic review by the division should it be felt that growth is occurring or will occur in the area. 25-8-501.1. Permit required for point source water pollution control - definitions - housed commercial swine feeding operations - legislative declaration. (1) The people of the Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 563state of Colorado hereby find, determine, and declare that the advent of large housed commercial swine feeding operations in Colorado has presented new challeng es to ensuring that the quality of the state' s environment is preserved and protected. As disting uished from more traditional operations that historically have characteriz ed Colorado' s livestock industry , large housed swine feeding operations use significant amounts of process water for flushing and disposing of swine waste, commonly store this waste in large impoundments, and dispose of it throu gh land application. The waste storag e, handling and disposal by such operations are particularly odorous and offensive. The people furth er find that it is necessary to ensure that the storag e and land application of waste by housed commercial swine feeding operations is done in a responsible manner, so as not to adversely impact Colorado' s valuable air, land and water resources. (2) As used in this section, unless the contex t otherwise requires: (a) \"Agronomic rate of application\" means the rate of application of nutrients to plants that is necessary to satisfy the plants' nutritiona l requirements while strictly minimiz ing the amount of nutrients that run off to surface waters or which pass below the root z one of the plants, as specified by the most current published fertiliz er suggestions of the Colorado state university cooperative extension service for the plants, or most closely related plant type, to which the nutrients are applied. (b) \"Housed commercial swine feeding operation\" means a housed swine feeding operation that is capable of housing eight hundred thousand pounds or more of live animal weig ht of swine at any one time or is deemed a commercial operation under local zoning or land use regulations. Two or more housed swine confined feeding operatio ns shall be considered to comprise a single housed commerc ial swine feeding operation if they are under common or affiliated ownership or manag ement, and are adjacent to or utilize a common area or system for manure disposal, are integ rated in any way, are located or discharg e within the same watershed or into watersheds that are hydrolo gically connected, or are located on or discharg e onto land overly ing the same g roundwater aquifer. (c) \"Housed swine feeding operation\" means the practice of raising swine in building s, or other enclosed structures wherein swine of any size are fed for forty-five days or longer in any twelve-month period, and crop or forag e growth or production is not sustained in the area of confinement. (d) \"Process wastewater\" means any process-g enerated wastewater used in a housed commercial swine feeding operation, including water used for feeding , flushing , or washing , and any water or precipitation that comes into contact with any manure, urine, or any product used in or resulting from the production of swine. (3) No person shall operate, construct, or expand a housed commercial swine feeding operation without first having obtained an individual discharg e permit from the division. (4) On or before March 31, 1999, the commission shall promulg ate rules necessary to ensure the issuance and effective administration and enforcement of permits under this section by July 1, 1999. Such rules shall incorporate the preceding subsection (3) and shall, at a minimum, require: (a) That the owner or operator of a housed commercial swine feeding operation must obtain division approval of construction, operations and swine waste manag ement plans that, for any land waste application, includes a detailed agronomic analysis. Said plans shall employ the Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 564best available waste manag ement practices, provide for remediation of residua l soil and groundwater contamination, and ensure that disposal of solid or liquid waste to the soil not exceed ag ronomic rates of application. (b) That appropriate setback s for maintaining water quality be established for land waste application areas and waste impoundments; (c) That waste impoundments or manure stock piles shall not be located within a one- hundred-y ear floodplain unless proper flood proofing measures are desig ned and constructed; (d) That the owner or operator of the housed commercial swine feeding operation shall provide financ ial assurances for the final closure of the housed commercial swine feeding operation, the conduct of any necessary postclosure activities, the undertaking of any corrective action made necess ary by migration of contaminants from the housed commercial swine feeding operation into the soil and g roundwater, or cleanup of any spill or breach; (e) That the owner or operator of a housed commercial swine feeding operation shall ensure that no solid or liquid waste g enerated by it shall be applied to land by any person at a rate that ex ceeds, in amount or duration, the ag ronomic rate of application; and (f) That, because waste storage and disposal by housed commercial swine feeding operations pose particular jeopardy for state trust lands, in light of the mandate in the Colorado constitution, article IX, section 10, that state land board trust lands be held in trust and be protected and enhanced to promote long-term productivity and sound stewardship, the construction, operations and waste manag ement plans approved for housed commercial swine feeding operations on such lands, shall not permit the degradation of the physical attributes or value of any state trust lands. (5) Any spill or contamination by a housed commercial swine feeding operation shall be reported immediately to the division and the county or district public health agency for the county in which the housed commercial swine feeding operation is cond ucted, and, within twenty -four hours after the spill or contamination, a written report shall be filed with the division and the county or district public health agency for the county in which the housed commercial swine feeding operation is conducted. (6) Housed commercial swine feeding operations shall submit to the division and the county or district public health agency quarterly , comprehensive monitoring reports and agronomic analyses that demonstrate that the operation has land-applied solid and liquid waste at no greater than agronomic rates . The division shall require the sampling and monitoring of chemical and appropriate biolog ical parameters to protect the quality and existing and future beneficial uses of groundwater including , at a minimum, nitrog en, phosphorus, heavy metals, and salts. At a minimum, the monitoring program shall include quarterly samples, analy sis, and reporting of the groundwater, soils within the root zone, and soils beneath the root zone within each waste application site, and shall also include monitoring to ensure that no excessive seepag e occurs from any waste impoundments. (7) Repealed. (8) The division shall enforce the provisions of this section and shall take immediate enforcement action against any housed commercial swine feeding operation that has exceeded the ag ronomic rate limit of this section. I n addition, any person who may be adversely affected by Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 565a housed commercial swine feeding operation may enforce these provisions directly against the operation by filing a civil action in the district court in the county in which the person resides. (9) These provisions shall not preclude any local government from imposing requirements more restrictive than those contained in this section. 25-8-502. Application - definitions - fees - water quality control fund - anim al feeding operations fund - public participation - repe al. (1) (a) For the purposes of this section: (I) \"Discharg e\" means discharg e of pollutants as defined in section 25-8-103 (3), and also includes land application. (II) \"Land application\" is any discharg e being applied to the land for treatment purposes. (b) (I) Except as otherwise provided by law, in addition to the fees assessed pursuant to parag raphs (b.5), (b.6), (b.7), and (g) of this subsection (1), the only fee the division may assess is an annual fee upon a discharg er, and such fee shall be in accordan ce with the following schedule: Facility Categories and Subcategories for Permit Fees Annual F ees (A) Category 01 Sand and gravel and placer m ining Subcateg ory 1 Pit dewatering only $ 500 Subcateg ory 2 Pit dewatering and/or washwater discharg e $ 570 Subcateg ory 3 Mercury use with discharg e impact $ 640 Subcateg ory 4 Storm water discharg e only $ 435 (B) Category 02 Coal m ining Subcateg ory 1 Sedimentation ponds, surface runoff only $ 980 Subcateg ory 2 Mine water, preparation plant discharg e $ 1,320 (C) Category 03 Hardrock m ining Subcateg ory 1 Mine dewatering from 0 up to 49,999 g allons per day $ 1,140 Subcateg ory 2Mine dewatering from 50,000 up to 999,999 gallons per day $ 2,150 Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 566Subcateg ory 3Mine dewatering from 1,000,000 g allons per day or over $ 3,280 Subcateg ory 4 Mine dewatering and milling with no discharg e $ 3,280 Subcateg ory 5 Mine dewatering and milling with discharg e $ 9,880 Subcateg ory 6 No discharg e $ 1,140 Subcateg ory 7Milling with discharg e from 0 up to 49,999 gallons per day $ 3,350 Subcateg ory 8Milling with discharg e from 50,000 g allons per day or greater $ 6,680 (D) Category 04 Oil shale Subcateg ory 1 Sedimentation ponds, surface runoff only $ 1,990 Subcateg ory 2 Mine water from 0 up to 49,999 g allons per day $ 2,150 Subcateg ory 3 Mine water from 50,000 up to 999,999 g allons per day $ 2,670 Subcateg ory 4 Mine water from 1,000,000 g allons per day or over $ 2,600 Subcateg ory 5 Mine water and process water discharg e $ 9,880 Subcateg ory 6 No discharg e $ 1,830 (E) Category 05 Concentrated anim al feeding operations (CAF Os) Subcateg ory 1General permit: The division shall assess a CAFO an annual permit fee, not to exceed $250 plus $0.04 per animal unit, based on the CAF O's permitted capacity ; except that, from July 1, 2009, throug h June 30, 2015, the division shall assess a CAF O an annual permit fee not to ex ceed $750 plus $0.09 per animal unit, based on the CAF O's permitted capacity Subcateg ory 2Individual permit: The division shall assess a CAF O an annual permit fee, not to exceed $500 plus $0.08 per animal unit, based on the CAF O's permitted capacity ; except that, Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 567from July 1, 2009, throug h June 30, 2015, the division shall assess a CAF O an annual permit fee not to ex ceed $1,500 plus $0.09 per animal unit, based on the CAF O's permitted capacity (F) Category 06 Water treatm ent plants Subcateg ory 1 Intermittent discharg e $ 570 Subcateg ory 2 Routine discharg e $ 820 (G) Category 07 General perm its Subcateg ory 1A Sand and g ravel with process discharg e and storm water $ 270 Subcateg ory 1B Sand and g ravel without process discharg e - storm water only $ 75 Subcateg ory 2 Construction dewatering $ 500 Subcateg ory 3 [Reserved for future use] Subcateg ory 4 Placer mining $ 520 Subcateg ory 5 Coal mining $ 780 Subcateg ory 6 Water treatment plants - intermittent discharg e $ 475 Subcateg ory 7 Water treatment plants - routine discharg e $ 715 Subcateg ory 8 Oil and g as cleanup $ 1,840 Subcateg ory 9A Construction - storm water only ; 5 acres or more of disturbed area $ 245 Subcateg ory 9B Construction - storm water only ; 1 to less than 5 acres of disturbed area $ 245 Subcateg ory 10 Industrial - sing le municipal industrial - storm water only $ 185 Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 568Subcateg ory 11 (Deleted by amendment, L . 2002, p. 1657, \u00a7 2, effective J une 7, 2002.)

This part 2 shall be known and may be cited as the \"State Hazardous W aste Siting Act\" . Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 68025-15-200.2. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly hereby finds that adverse public health and environmental impacts can result from the improper land disposal of hazardous waste and that the need for establishing safe sites with adequate capacity for the dispos al of hazardous waste is a matter of statewide concern, and the provisions of this part 2 are therefore enacted to provide an effective method of establishing such sites. (2) It is the intent of the general assembly that generators of hazardous waste be encourag ed to use on-site and off-site alternative treatment methods to reduce the amount of hazardous waste that must be discharg ed into the environment and the associated hazards to the health and welfare of the citizens of this state. Alternative manag ement technolog ies which detoxify, stabiliz e, and reduce the amount of hazardous waste that must be buried are available. For such purpose, the provisions of this part 2 are enacted to allow the development of safe alternative methods for the treatment of hazardous waste and to provide a means for the desig nation of hazardous waste disposal sites when such methods are unable to obviate the need for hazardous waste disposal on land. Whereas the state of Colorado may be responsible for the perpetual care of hazardous waste land disposal facilitie s, alternative technolog ies such as incineration, resource recovery, or physical, chemical, or biolog ical degradation should be implemented to the max imum ex tent possible. 25-15-200.3.

Legislative declaration. The g eneral assembly declares that it is in the public interest to ensure that environmenta l remediation projects protect human health and the environment. The general assembly finds that environmental remediation projects may leave residual contamination at levels that have been determined to be safe for a specific use, but not all uses, and may incorporate engineered structures that must be maintained or protected against damag e to remain effective. The general assembly finds that in such cases, it is necessary to provide an effective and enforceable means of ensuring the conduct of any required maintenan ce, monitoring , or operation, and of restricting future uses of the land, including placi ng restrictions on drilling for or pumping groundwater for as long as any residual contamination remains hazardous. The general assembly, therefore, declares that it is in the public interest to create environmental covenants and notices of environmental use restrictions because such covenants and restrictive notices are necessary for the protection of human health and the environment. 25-15-318. Nature of environm ental covenants. (1) An environmental covenant shall be perpetual unless by its terms it is limited to a specific duration, unless the department appro ves a request to terminate or modify it pursuant to section 25-15-319 (1) (h), or unless it is terminated by a court of competent jurisdiction. An environmental covenant may not be extinguished, limited, or impaired throug h issuance of a tax deed or throug h adverse possession, nor may an environmental covenant be extinguished, limited, or impaired by reason of the doctr ines of abandonment, waiver, lack of enforcement, or other common law principles relating to covenants, or by the ex ercise of eminent domain. (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including any common-law requirement Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 708for privity of estate, an environm ental covenant shall run with the land and shall bind the owner of the land, the owner' s successors and assig ns, and any person using the land. An environmental covenant shall not be deemed unenforceable on the basis of: (a) A lack of privity of contract; (b) A lack of benefit to a particular parcel of land; (c) F ailure of the environmental covenant to ex pressly state that it runs with the land; or (d) Any other inconsistency with common-law requirements applicable to common-law covenants. (3) The requirements and restrictions of an environmen tal covenant are requirements under this part 3 but may only be enforced as provided in section 25-15-322. The creation of an environmental covenant does not trig ger the application of any other requirement of this part 3. (4) The department shall not acquire any liability under state law by virtue of accepting an environment al covenant, nor shall any named beneficiary of an environmental covenant acquire any liability under state law by virtue of being such a beneficiary . 25-15-318.5. Nature of a notice of environm ental use restrictions. (1) A notice of environmental use restrictions is an ag ency action based on the state' s police power. (2) A notice of environmental use restrictions is binding on current and subsequent owners of the affected land and any person using or possessing an interest in the land. (3) The requirements and restrictions contained in a notice of environmental use restrictions are requirements under this part 3, but may be enforced only as provided in section 25-15-322. The creation of a notice of environmental use restrictions does not trigger the application of any other requirement of this part 3. 25-15-319. Contents of environm ental covenants and notices of environm ental use restrictions. (1) Environmental covenants and notices of environme ntal use restrictions shall include provisions reg arding : (a) Duration and any conditions under which the environmental covenant or restrictive notice may be modified or terminated; (b) Any environmental use restrictions relied on in the remediation decision for the environmental remediation project for the subject property ; (c) A requirement that the owner of the property subject to the environmental covenant or restrictive notice notify the department at least fifteen days in advance of any transfer of ownership of some or all of the real property subject to the environmental covenant or restrictive notice; (d) A requirement that the owner of the property notify the department simultaneously with submitting any application to a local government for a building permit or chang e in land use; (e) A requirement to allow the department right of entry at reasonable times with prior notice for the purpose of determining compliance with the terms of the environmental covenan t or restrictive notice. Nothing in this section shall impair any other authority the department may Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 709otherwise have to enter and inspec t property subject to the environmental covenant or restrictive notice. (f) (I ) For environmental covenants, inclusion of the following statement on the first pag e of the instrument creating the environmental covena nt in fifteen-point, bold-faced type: \"This property is subject to an environmental covenant held by the Colorado department of public health and environment pursuant to section 25-15-321, Colorado Revised Statutes.\" (II) For restrictive notices, inclusion of the following statement on the first page of the restrictive notice in fifteen-point, bold-faced type: \"This property is subject to a notice of environmental use restrictions imposed by the Colorado department of public health and environment pursuant to section 25-15-321.5, Colorado Revised Statutes.\" (g) A requirement to incorporate, either in full or by reference, the environmental covenant or restrictive notice in any leases, licenses, or other instruments granting a right to use the property that may be affected by the environmental covenant or restrictive notice; (h) Modification or termination of the environmental covenant or restrictive notice consistent with this subsection (1). The owner of land subject to an environmental covenant or restrictive notice may request that the department approve modification or termination of the covenant or restrictive notice. The request shall contain information showing that the proposed modification or termination shall, if implemented, ensure protection of human health and the environment. The department shall review any submitted information and may request additional information. If the department determines that the proposal to modify or terminate the environmental covenant or restrictive notice will ensure protection of human health and the environment, it shall approve the proposal. No modification or termination of an environmental covenant or restrictive notice shall be effective unless it has been approved in writing by the department. Informa tion to support a request for modification or termination may include one or more of the following : (I) A proposal to perform additional remedial work; (II) New information reg arding the risks posed by the residual contamination; (III) Information demonstrating that residual contamination has diminished; (IV) Information demonstrating that an engineered feature or structure is no longer necessary ; (V) Information demonstrating that the proposed modification would not adversely impact the remedy and is protective of human health and the environment; and (VI) Other appropriate supporting information; and (i) Such other subjects as may be appropriate. 25-15-320. Environm ental covenants - when required - waiver. (1) No environmental covenant shall be required for any environme ntal remediation project that results in residual contamination levels that have been determined by the relevant regulatory agency to be safe for all uses and that does not incorporate any engineered feature or structure or require any monitoring , maintenance, or operation. (2) Except as specified in subsections (3) and (4) of this section, an environmental covenant under this part 3 shall be required for any environmental remediation project in which Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 710the relevant regulatory authority makes a remed ial decision on or after July 1, 2001, that would result in either or both of the following : (a) Residual contamination at levels that have been determined to be safe for one or more specific uses, but not all uses; or (b) Incorporation of an engineered feature or structure that requires monitoring , maintenance, or operation or that will not function as intended if it is disturbed. (3) The department may waive the requirement for an environmental covenant in the following circumstances: (a) If the department determin es that it is authoriz ed under another statute or decision of the Colorado supreme court to implement and enforce environmental use restrictions against the present and subsequent owners of real property remediated pursuant to an environmental remediation project and implements environmental use restrictions unde r such statute or decision; or (b) For a parcel of land involved in an environmental remediation project that is owned by any person who is not being required to remediate the contamination, and: (I) The owner of any such parcel does not grant an environmental covenant under this section; (II) The county , city and county , or municip ality having jurisdiction over the affected land has enacted an ordinance or resolution imposing the relevant environmental use restrictions; and (III) The county , city and county , or municipality having jurisdiction and the department have entered into an interg overnmental agreement for oversig ht and enforcement of the local ordinance or resolution pursuant to section 29-1-203, C.R.S.

The department shall have such authority as may be provided in the interg overnmental agreement to bring suit for injunct ive relief to enforce any local ordinance or resolution described in this subsection (3), but only with respect to properties that are subject to the requirements of this section. Any intergovernmental agreement under this section shall require that, insofar as the local ordinance or resolution applies to properties that are subject to the requirements of this section, any amendments to the local ordinance or resolution shall incorporate such requirem ents as the department may recommend to ensure continued protection of human health and the environment. (4) (a) When an environmental covenant is required under subsection (2) of this section, a restrictive notice may be substituted for the covenant as follows: (I) An owner of a parcel of land involved in an environmental remediation project who is being required to remediate contamination may request that the department approve a proposed restrictive notice for such parcel or may request that the department issue a restrictive notice. (II) The department may unilaterally issue a restric tive notice containing the provisions described in section 25-15-319 when an environmental covenant is required under subsection (2) of this section and the owner of the subject property fails to create a covenant or restrictive notice within thirty days after: (A) The date of a remedial decision for an environm ental remediation project that relies solely on environmental use restrictions to protect human health and the environment; or (B) The completion of construction work for environmental remediation projects that Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 711require phy sical work. (b) Prior to issuing a restricti ve notice unilaterally under subparag raph (II) of parag raph (a) of this subsection (4), the department shall make a g ood-faith attempt to reach ag reement with the owner of the subject property regarding a consensual covenant or notice. (c) The department may not issue a restrictive notice for a parcel of land involved in an environmental remediation project that is owned by a person who is not being required to remediate the contamination, unless such person consents in writing . (5) The department may accept environmental covenants or issue restrictive notices in cases where such covenants or notices are not required, including approvals of voluntary cleanup plans or petitions for no action determinations under sections 25-16-306 and 25-16-307, but the owner of the remediated land nonetheless desires to create such a covenant or requests that the department issue such a notice.

Household medication take-back program - creation - liability - definitions - cash fund - rules. (1) (a) The general assembly finds and declares that prescription drug abuse is a rampant problem in Colorado, in part due to the accidental and intentional abuse of leftover household medications. The general assembly further declares that citizen access to a disposal location to return unused hous ehold medications will reduce the availability of household medications for unintended or abusive purposes and will further protect the environment throug h proper disposal. Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 715(b) It is the intent of the general assembly to establish a household medication take-back program to facilitate the safe and effective collection and proper disposal of unused medications. (2) As used in this section: (a) \"Approved collection site\" means a site approved by the department for the collection of unused household medications. (b) \"Carrier\" means an entity approved by the department to transport unused household medications from approved collection sites to a disposal location. (c) \"Disposal location\" means a site approved by the department where unused household medications are destr oyed in compliance with applicable laws so that the household medications are in a nonretrievable state and cannot be diverted for illicit purposes. (d) \"Household medications\" means controlled substances approved for collection by federal law, prescription drugs, and over-the-counter medications in the possession of an individual. (3) Subject to available funds, the executive director of the department shall establish a household medication take-back program to collect and dispose of unused household medications.

(4) A collection site, carrier, or disposal location is not subject to liability for incidents arising from the collection, transpor t, or disposal of household medications if the collection site, carrier, or disposal location complies with the household medication take-back progr am in good faith and does not violate any applicable laws. (5) The household medication take-back cash fund is created in the state treasury for the direct and indirect costs associated with the implementation of this section. The fund consists of money s appropriated or transferred to the fund by the general assembly and any gifts, grants, and donations from any public or private entity . The department shall transmit gifts, grants, and donations collected by the department to the state treasurer, who shall credit the money s to the fund. The money s in the fund are subject to annual appropriation by the g eneral assembly .

(1) The general assembly hereby finds that there is a need for more clarity and uniformity regarding the definition of infectious waste and in the requirements for the handling , treatment, and disposal thereof and that the absence of such clarity Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 716and the inappropriate designation of general waste as infectious waste will result in further substantial and unnecessary costs, disparity , and confusion in the manag ement of infectious waste, ultimately affecting many business and residential operations and facilities, including the operations and quality of care rendered by health care providers. (2) For the purposes set forth in subsection (1) of this section, the provisions of this part 4 are enacted as a matter of statewide concern. The provision s of this part 4 shall not apply to infectious waste which is also deemed to be hazardous waste pursuant to section 25-15-101 (6), nor shall infectious waste be deemed hazardous waste solely because it is characteriz ed as infectious waste. (3) The general assembly further finds that, because of the nature of infectious waste and the manner of its desig nation as provided in this part 4 and because this part 4 recommends portions of the guidelines of the United States environmental protection agency, no rules or regulations governing the generators of infectious waste are necessary for nor shall be applicable to the implementation of this part 4. This limitation shall not be construed to limit any other rule- making which is permitted under other authoriz ing statutes. 25-15-402. Infectious waste - definitions. (1) For the purposes of this part 4 and statewide applicability : (a) \"Infecti ous waste\" means waste capable of producing an infectious disease and requires the consideration of certain factors necessary for induction of disease. These factors include: (I) Presence of a pathog en of sufficient virulence; (II) Dose; (III) Portal of entry ; (IV) Resistance of host. (b) For a waste to be infectious, it must contain pathog ens with sufficient virulence and quantity so that exposure to the waste by a susceptible host could result in disease. All the factors specified in parag raph (a) of this subsection (1) must be present simultaneously for disease transmission to occur and must be present in a manner which constitut es a substantial risk of infection to humans. (2) (a) Infectious waste shall be desig nated as such by the generator in accordance with this part 4. Such desig nation shall not be based solely upon any source or type of waste but shall be based upon the factors specified in subsection (1) of this section. (b) It is recommended by the general assembly that the following categories of waste, as published in the \" EPA Guide for I nfectious W aste Manag ement\" , May 1986, by the United States environmental protection ag ency, be desig nated as infectious: (I) Isolation wastes from persons diagnosed as having a disease caused by an organism requiring , pursuant to recommendations by the centers for disease control in the 1988 publication \"Biosafety in the Microbiolog ical and Biomedical Laboratory \" (second edition), biosafety level IV containment; (II) Cultures and stocks of infectious ag ents and associated biolog icals; (III) Human blood and blood products and body fluids consisting of serum, plasma and Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 717other blood components, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pericardial fluid, and amniotic fluid; (IV) Human patholog ical/anatomical waste consisting of tissues and body parts that are discarded from surg ical, obstetrical, autopsy , and laboratory procedures; (V) Contaminated sharps; (VI) Contaminated laboratory or research animal carcasses, body parts, and bedding . 25-15-402.5. Disposition of fetal tissue. (1) As used in this section, unless the contex t otherwise requires, \"fetal death\" means death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of human conception, irrespective of the duration of preg nancy . The death is indicated by the fact that after such expulsion or extraction the fetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles. (2) Nothing in this part 4 shall be deemed to prohibit the treatment of the remains from a fetal death pursuant to article 54 of title 12, C.R.S. 25-15-403. Generator managem ent plan. (1) Each generator of infectious waste shall develop and implement an on-site infectious waste manag ement plan which is appropriate for the particular facility . Such plan shall include: (a) The desig nation of infectious waste g enerated by the facility ; (b) The handling of infectious waste which includes segregation, identification, packag ing, storag e, transportation, treatment techniques for each waste type, if applicable, and disposal; (c) Conting ency planning for spills or loss of containment; (d) Staff training and the desig nation of a person responsible for implementation of the manag ement plan; (e) If on-site treatment is not available, the manag ement plan shall provide for appropriate off-site treatment or disposal. (2) The manag ement plan, including the documentation provided in section 25-15-404 (2), shall be available for inspection to the hauler of any waste, to the disposal facility , and to the licensing or reg ulatory agency, if applicable, of the g enerator. 25-15-404. On-site disinf ection. (1) Any infectious waste which has been appropriately treated at the site of generation by the generator so as to render it noninfectious shall not thereafter be deemed infectious for purposes of handling or disposal. (2) Appropriate treatment shall include any method of treatment which renders the infectious waste noninfectious. Use of a treatment method recommended by the United States environmental protection agency, as published in the \"EPA Guide for Infectious Waste Manag ement\" , May 1986, shall be conclusively presumed to be an appropriate treatment method. Any method of treatment shall include: Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 718(a) Documentation by the generator that the method of treatment utiliz ed for his operation is effective in rendering infectious waste noninfectious in such operation; (b) Written standard operating procedures for the use of or implementation of the treatment method; (c) Regular monitoring of the standard operating procedures and the effectiveness of such disinfective method. (3) Upon request of the chairman of either the senate or house of representatives committees on health, environment, welfare, and institutions, or any successor committees, the department of public health and environment shall make a report to the senate and house of represe ntatives committees on health, environment, welfare, and institutions, or any successor committees, on the current status, in view of scientific knowledg e and technology, of the recommendations contained in the \"EPA Guide for Infectious Waste Manage ment\" , May 1986, and may make any additional recommendations it deems necessary . 25-15-405. Appropriate treatm ent and disposal - nonliability. (1) A generator of infectious waste using an appropriate treatment method with appropriate documentation as provided in section 25-15-404 (2) and, in good faith, utiliz ing disposal facilities for such waste shall not be civilly or criminally liable for injuries or damag es alleg edly resulting from the infec tious character of such waste; except that any generator who does not use an appropriate treatment method or any generator who fails to utiliz e disposal facilities in good faith shall not be relieved of civil or criminal liability . (2) When any infectious waste has been appropriately treated, the generator shall either identify it as such or provide the hauler and disposal facility with a written statement that its general waste includes infectious waste which has been appropriately treated to render it noninfectious. 25-15-406. Penalty. (1) (a) Any generator who knowing ly removes, causes to be removed, or allows to be removed from the site of generation any infectious waste which he knew was not appropriately treated and not identified as untreated when such infectious waste was so removed from the site of generation shall be subject to the civil penalties set forth in parag raph (b) of this subsection (1). (b) Upon conviction of a first offense, a generator shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than three thousand dollar s per day for each day of violation, not to exceed fifteen thousand dollars. Upon conv iction of a second or subsequent offense which occurs within five years of a previous conviction, a generator shall be subject to a civil penalty of three thousand dollars per day for each day of violation, not to ex ceed twenty -five thousand dollars. (2) (a) Any person who knowing ly hauls untreated infectious waste and recklessly spills or loses such waste or knowing ly disposes of such waste at an unlawful site or disposal or treatment facility shall be subject to the civil penalties set forth in parag raph (b) of this subsection (2). Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 719(b) Upon conviction of a first offense, a person shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than three thousand dollars per day for each day of violation, not to exceed fifteen thousand dollars. Upon conviction of a second or subsequent offense which occurs within five years of a previous conviction, a person shall be subject to a civil penalty of three thousand dollars per day, not to ex ceed twenty -five thousand dollars. (3) All civil penalties set forth in this section shall be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction upon action instituted by the department of public health and environment. 25-15-407. Presum ption of noninf ectiousness. It is conclusivel y presumed that any infectious waste which has been appropriately treated and documented in section 25-15-404 (2) either on the site or off the site is not infectious after it has been so treated.

(2) The general assembly therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the youth and families of the state to create a single division in the department of public health and environment to operate prevention and interventi on programs and to oversee the provision of preventio n, intervention, and treatment services throug h federally and state-funded prevention, intervention, and treatment programs to ensure collaboration among programs and the availability of a continuum of services for y outh.

This article shall be known and may be cited as the \"Colorado Oral Health Community Grants Prog ram Act\" . 25-21.5-102. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly hereby finds and declares that: (a) Statewide, students miss seven million eight hundred thousand school hours each year due to oral pain. Nationwide, workers miss one hundred sixty-four million work hours each year due to dental issues. (b) Forty percent of children in kinderg arten and fifty-five percent of children in third Colorado Revised Statutes 2014 Uncertif ied Printout 804grade have a history of dental decay . (c) Children in low-income schools have twice as much untreated tooth decay and are twice as likely to have a history of cavities than children who are not in low-income schools. (d) Among children, ninety percent of dental decay is in the pits and fissures of posterior permanent teeth. (e) Children who have received dental sealants in a school-based program have, for a period of up to five years, sixty percent fewer new decayed pit and fissure surfaces in their posterior permanent teeth than children who have not received an application of dental sealants. (f) Fluoride is nature' s cavity fighter. Fluoride occurs naturally in almost all water sources. Since 1948, scientific research has shown that community water fluoridation can reduce the incidence of dental cavities. (g) Community water fluoridation is the process of adjusting the level of fluoride found naturally in water to a level recommended to protect against dental decay . The center s for disease control named community water fluoridation as one of ten great public health achievements of the twentieth century . (h) Water fluoridation is safe and provides the most cost-effective means to prevent tooth decay for persons of all ag es and socioeconomic backg rounds. (i) Water fluoridation is one of the most researched and cost-effective oral health interventions available, as the averag e cost of one dental filling can fund a lifetime of fluoridation, which is known to prevent eighteen to forty percent of cavities in both children and adults. (2) The general assembly further finds that improving access to oral health care services and fluori dated water for all Coloradans, particularly low-income Coloradans, will reduce the burden of oral disease. Therefore, the Colorado oral health program dedicates itself to improving access to oral health care services by working with community stakeholders, professional organizations, and direct recipients of oral health care to remove barriers to access to oral health care. (3) The purpose of this article is to promote the public health and welfare of Coloradans by providing a grant prog ram to: (a) Provide oral health services, including sealants, to school children; and (b) Assist communities in attaining optimal levels of fluoride in drinking water provided by community water sy stems as a means of preventing dental decay . 25-21.5-103.

Grants awarded in this categ ory may support the following : (I) School-based prog rams that are conducted completely within the school setting ; (II) School-linked prog rams that are connected with schools but deliver services off-site; (III) School-linked prog rams that conduct dental screening s at schools; and (IV) Hy brid prog rams that incorporate school-based and school-linked components. (b) F luoridation support services, including : (I) Assistance in the desig n, purchase, installation, maintenance, and inspection of equipment desig ned to add fluoride to drinking water to achieve optimal levels for the prevention of tooth decay , as determined by the federal department of health and human services; (II) Training of water treatment personnel in the proper operation of fluoridation equipment and current water fluoridation practices; and (III) Monitoring of fluoride content by obtaining monthly samples of finished drinking water to assure the optimal level of fluoride to prevent dental decay . 25-21.5-105.

Legislative declaration. (1) The g eneral assembly hereby finds that: (a) Many dental professionals, particularly dentists, graduate with large debt levels that were used to finance their professional education; (b) Dentistry is provi ded predominantly throug h individual practices, which minimiz es the opportunity for dental professionals to provide unreimbursed services while maintaining the costs of a practice and repay ing their educational loans; (c) Many Colorado communities encounter difficulty recruiti ng dental providers dedicated to serving underserved populations; (d) Incentives to reduce the indebtedness of dental professionals will increase access to dental care for underserved populations. (2) The general assembly also finds that, during the 2000 regular session, the general assembly expanded the children' s basic health plan to include dental services and paid for such expansion out of the tobacco settlement moneys, but, due to a lack of dental providers, the inclusion of dental care services was made conting ent upon an adequate number of dental providers being willing to provide services. The general assembly hereby finds that the loan repay ment program created in this article would provide a method to develop the infrastructure and resources needed to provide dental services as part of the children' s basic health plan. (3) The general assembly , therefore, states that the purpose of this article is to encourag e and enable dental professionals to provide care throug h the children' s basic health plan and the medicaid program and to other underserved popula tions in Colorado by the use of a financial incentive prog ram. 25-23-102.
