Haunted by fears of another coronary event, heart disease patients may fall victim to despair. Survivors sometimes sink into a crippling depression in the wake of sud - den cardiac surgery or a life-threatening heart attack. Cardiac patients are three times more likely than healthy people to suffer from depression, warns the American Heart Association. The Veterans Administration recently found that a history of major depression increases cardiovascular risk more than a family history of heart disease. Depression raises the risk for heart failure in otherwise healthy people and hastens heart disease progression. Heart failure patients with depression are much more likely to require re-hospitalization or to suffer a fatal heart attack or stroke. According to the American Medical Association, major depression is associ - ated with a three-fold increase in cardiac mortality risk after a heart attack. Quitting smoking and making heart-healthy lifestyle changes can lower the risk of suffering another cardiovascular event. Antidepressant medication or cognitive behavioral therapy can help patients cope with feelings and fears (see \"NeuroStar: TMS for Depression,\" page 9) . \"Although depression raises the risk of having another heart attack, car - diac rehabilitation has been shown to reduce the incidence of recurrent heart attack by 22 percent,\" says Paul Thompson, M.D., director of Cardiology at Hartford Hospital. \"Medically supervised exercise helps heart attack patients recover, possibly in part by helping them experience less depression after their cardiac event.\" H E A L T H T I P S Know Your Heart-Health Numbers Blood Risky: > 3.0 mg/LHeart of Darkness People with normal cholesterol levels suffer about half of the 1.5 million heart attacks and 600,000 strokes that occur in the United States each year. Stroke is a killer, ac - counting for nearly 2,000 deaths annually in Connecticut. While guidelines can be a useful screening tool for popu - lations, an individual's chances of having a heart attack or stroke are strongly influenced by obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, diet and sedentary lifestyle\u2014not just cholesterol levels. What can you do to change your cardiovascular risk factors? Despite warnings about a fatty diet, meat consump - tion has nearly doubled in the United States over the past half-century. A diet rich in saturated fat or genetic predis - position can raise cholesterol to artery-clogging levels. A decade-long National Institutes of Health study of 500,000 Americans age 50-71 found that those who consumed the most red and processed meat were up to 40 percent more likely to die than those who ate less meat.Change of Heart Dangerously high levels of LDL (low-density lipoprotein or \"bad\" cholesterol) trigger the buildup of fatty plaque, causing chest pain and arterial blockages. When dietary changes\u2014such as eating less saturated fat and more fish and poultry\u2014yield only a modest drop in serum cholesterol levels, drugs called statins can have dramatic lipid-lowering effects. \"We now understand the important role of genetics rather than diet alone in cholesterol,\" says cardiologist James E. Dougherty, M.D., medical director of Hartford Hospital's heart transplant program. \"Triglycerides and sugar are related to carbohydrate intake and nutrition, so they are more diet and exercise driven. People with diabetes or at high risk for cardiovascular disease should be taking cholesterol-lowering drugs. We used to think that plaque gradually accumulated in an artery until a blocked vessel caused a heart attack, but now we know that any plaque build-up raises your risk.\" Although patients often think they can change their cholesterol levels with diet and exercise, Dr. Dougherty says most people can't lower their LDL levels significantly on their own\u2014and there's no way to meaningfully raise their HDL (good) cholesterol either. \"Lower is better when it comes to LDL,\" he says. \"We have many good medications for cholesterol management.\" Marketed under such brand names as Lipitor, Zocor and Crestor, cholesterol-lowering drugs are among the world's top-selling medicines. In rare cases, however, the drugs can cause neuromuscular pain or muscle injury. With funding from NIH and Hartford Hospital, the biomedical company Genomas is collaborating with Hartford Hospital to cre - ate diagnostic markers to tailor the drug choice. Genomas' proprietary PhyzioType predicts a patient's response to diet, exercise and drugs by identifying markers unique to each individual. \"Growing evidence indicates that genetics determine who does and does not have muscle complaints with statins,\" says Hartford Hospital Director of Cardiology Paul Thompson, M.D. Recent advances have identified DNA variants that can guide selection and dosing of medications. Thanks to a revolutionary breakthrough in personalized medicine, PhyzioType can \"enable the diagnosis and drug-specific pre - diction statin side effects,\" says Genomas President Gualberto Rua\u00f1o, M.D., director of Genetics Research, Hartford Hospital. \"By combining physiological factors with genetic information, we can discover specific recommendations about treatment and provide physicians with an unprecedented capability to select for each patient the safest drug treatment.\" 3New Technotools are Transforming Neurosurgery Inam U. Kureshi, M.D. (left) and Arnold J. Rossi, M.D. In the glow of the operating suite, a beam of hot white light illuminates a thin part in vaselined hair, painted with iodine. The soft whirr of a drill opens a bony flap in the top of the skull, a \"key - hole\" for high-tech instruments that will unlock the brain's secrets. No need to shave the head or cut an incision in the scalp. When the operation is over, the neurosurgeon simply replaces the bone and secures it with a tiny plate and a couple of screws. Minimally invasive surgery has harnessed the power of fiberoptics and lasers to create optical scalpels that blast tumors into vapor. Downsized drills and high-definition cameras and monitors give surgeons a high-tech window on the brain. Technology gives surgeons the tools to delve into the brain to excise tumors or repair stroke damage without harming \"eloquent\" regions that control speech and language. Within the brain, an esti - mated 100 billion interconnected nerve cells shape emotion, sensation, movement and memory. The Lightest Cut Wielding lasers instead of scalpels, today's neu - rosurgeons operate on the brain with meticulous care. Neurosurgeons treat diseases and disorders of the brain, spinal cord, spine, skull and vascular system. Three-dimensional navigational devices reveal lesions or tumors as image-guided computer systems and high-tech cameras point instruments through an intricate web of blood vessels and nerves. \"Just before surgery, we image the brain with MRI or computerized tomography (CT) scans to generate coordinates in three different planes,\" ex - plains Arnold J. Rossi, Jr., M.D., the first neurosur - geon at Hartford Hospital to use the laser scalpel. \"We precisely pinpoint where to put the 'trap-door' in the skull to remove the tumor. We use ultrasonic aspirators and other devices to debulk and cau - terize. The CO 2 laser is used mostly to shrink and 'evaporate' tumors because it has the advantage of fine detail with minimal tissue damage. Without ever touching the brain, the neurosurgeon points the laser beam at the tumor and 'paints' it with light while sparing sensitive areas.\" Most brain tumors arise elsewhere and spread from cancers of the lung, breast or colon. One exception is a meningioma, a large, often benign tumor\u2014sometimes as big as a grapefruit\u2014that tends to grow back after surgery. As for a glioma, the most common primary brain cancer, Dr. Rossi says the challenge is to destroy every cell, since malignant tumors sometimes sprout microscopic tails that infiltrate deep into the brain. When tumors are inoperable, the Trilogy radia - tion system at the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center offers options for stereotactic neurosur - gery. Hartford Hospital is a high-volume center for intracranial surgery, spinal and neurovascular surgery, skull base surgery and innovative radio - surgery of malignant and benign brain tumors. Neurosurgeons collaborate with radiation oncolo - gists to target lesions in critical areas of the brain, using image-guided delivery and a helmet-like device that holds a patient's head completely still during radiosurgery. Head injury victims are airlifted by LIFE STAR helicopter to Hartford Hospital, the region's only Level 1 Trauma Center. \"Hartford Hospital funds a head injury clinic to provide testing and follow-up care for patients who have suffered head trauma,\" says vascular neurosurgeon Inam U. Kureshi, M.D., head of the hospital's Department of Neurosurgery. \"Although acute critical care is important, trau - matic brain injury victims disheartened by linger - ing cognitive impairments, severe anxiety or post- traumatic stress disorder need ongoing counseling and support.\" Navigating the Brain Mapping prior to surgery is invaluable for neurosurgeons planning to operate on brain tumors, cerebral aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations in regions of the brain respon - sible for movement, perception and cognition. Neuronavigational systems will soon use func - tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to spare critical zones of motor and sensory function lying near the surgical site. \"Imaging is moving beyond MRI,\" says neurosurgeon David A. Kvam, M.D., who specializes in surgery involving the pituitary gland. \"MR spectroscopy allows us to look at the chemical nature of an abnormality to determine whether it's caused by a brain tumor, infection or stroke.\" Neurosurgeons respond immediately when an artery within the skull suddenly ruptures, spill -New Technotools are Transforming NeurosurgeryThe brain contains an estimated 100 billion interconnected nerve cells. Infinitesimal threadlike strands of fiber carry lightning-fast messages from the cerebral cortex down the spinal cord to the muscles, allowing coordination of complex movements. 5 PHYSICIAN PROFILE Paul J. Schwartz, M.D., Ph.D. ing blood into the brain. A neurosurgical team is always on call to collaborate with the Stroke Center's neurointerventional radiologists to stanch the bleeding from a ruptured aneurysm or hemorrhagic stroke. When the normal functioning of the brain is disrupted by stroke or trauma, craniotomy (removal of part of the skull) may be the only way to access the brain for delicate, life- saving surgery. New Stroke Technique Neurosurgeons can now divert a vessel in the scalp called the superficial temporal artery to supply blood-starved regions of the brain damaged by a stroke. Dr. Kureshi lifts the pulsating artery, and with the blood still coursing through it, pulls the vessel away from the scalp and sutures it to the top of the brain. New blood vessels eventually spring from the transplanted artery and re - route blood flow around blockages in the brain caused by a stroke. Since 2000, Hartford Hospital has been the only medical center in the state to offer the procedure, called encephaloduro- arteriosynangiosis (EDAS), for stroke patients who are good candidates to regrow new blood vessels. \"Angiograms show new vessels forming and carrying blood to the area of the brain where most strokes occur,\" says Dr. Kureshi. \"More than 75 percent of patients grow new a blood supply, but success rates would be even higher if patients would quit smoking. We don't disrupt the brain itself, so the procedure is very safe.\" Endovascular Pioneers Over the past decade, Stroke Center physicians and interven - tional radiologists at Hartford Hospital have used catheter-deliv - ered devices to directly dissolve or retrieve clots in brain arteries. The Stroke Center pioneered the development of a revolutionary method\u2014the MERCI clot retrieval device\u2014that can be threaded through a catheter (a tiny tube inserted into a blood vessel) to capture a clot. Armed with new tools and technology, endovascular neurosur - geons navigate vascular pathways from the femoral artery to the brain. Tiny plastic catheters\u2014some finer than a strand of angel hair pasta\u2014are used to deliver coils, sealants, clot-dissolving medicines, or dilating balloons to the affected area of the brain. Repair of blood vessels in the brain that have been damaged by stroke or cancer is now routine. \"Exciting changes are occurring in neurosurgery and treatment of intracranial vascular problems,\" says Dr. Kvam. \"In the past, people had to undergo open brain surgery to clip an aneurysm, for example. Minimally invasive endovascular techniques can now deliver stents through catheters to treat hemorrhages without ever touching the brain. New tools are driving new treatments and better outcomes.\" \"Surgery is the last resort,\" adds Dr. Kureshi. \"Prompt treat - ment for aneurysms can lead to full recovery. Anti-clotting drugs Paul J. Schwartz, M.D., Ph.D., a gen - eral neurosurgeon at Hartford Hospital, is in practice with Neurosurgeons of Central Connecticut, P.C. He graduated from Colgate University and earned his Ph.D. in neuroscience from Johns Hopkins University. After completing a post-graduate research fellowship at Massachusetts General Hospital, he taught neurobiology at Williams College. He attended medical school at Albany Medical College and did his residency in neurosurgery at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. He joined Hartford Hospital in 2008. Dr. Schwartz heads the neuro- oncology tumor board, which brings together the specialties of neurology, radiation oncology, medical oncology and radiology to consult with neuro- surgery on collaborative treatment plans for unusual brain and spine tumors. Dr. Schwartz, whose wife is a scientific editor in West Hartford, enjoys cooking, reading and traveling. 6like Plavix or aspirin can help 90 percent of people who suffer mini-strokes called transient ischemic attacks, or TIAs, recover if they stop smoking, control diabetes and lose weight.\" The Spine Center In today's high-tech operating room, spine surgery is a delicate blend of artistry and skill. At Hartford Hospital's Spine Center, spine surgeons, radiologists and neurolo - gists collaborate to reduce pain, using real-time imaging, X-ray fluoroscopy and minimally invasive surgical tech - niques. Neurosurgeons navigate an intricate maze of bones, muscles and blood vessels surrounding a network of nerves that run the length of the spinal canal and radiate into the legs and calves. Between the vertebrae are spongy discs that cushion the spine as it bends and twists, supported by bands of muscle. Each year, nearly 300,000 Americans undergo op - erations to \"fuse\" their unstable spines in the hope of relieving pain. \"We don't do surgery on everyone,\" says Andrew E. Wakefield, M.D., associate director of neurosur - gery at Hartford Hospital. \"Neurosurgeons suggest mini - mally invasive surgery when spine care and interventional pain management techniques fail. Treatment depends on whether it's a degenerative disc problem or a major trauma case requiring a complex reconstruction or spinal fusion.\" The hospital's neurosurgical intensive care and step- down (transitional) units, unique to the region, provide multi\u00acdisciplinary care for patients recovering from head or spine trauma, tumor removal or surgery involving the brain or spinal cord. The sixth floor of the Conklin Building, currently undergoing renovation, will soon be a dedicated post-spine surgery floor. The Spine Center's multidisci - plinary approach involves neurosurgery, orthopedics, nurs - ing, rehabilitation, physical therapy, discharge planning, interventional pain management and cooperation with physicians in the community, says Dr. Wakefield. Painful Backs Nearly four out of five Americans suffer from back pain. When sudden or severe back pain strikes, patients want a quick fix. While early intervention is crucial because back pain can become chronic if left untreated, rehabilitation physicians, called physiatrists, strive to avoid unnecessary surgery. \"At Hartford Hospital, we do fusions or recon - structive surgery only on people with intractable pain who haven't responded to anti-inflammatory drugs, exercise or other therapies,\" says neurosurgeon Paul J. Schwartz, M.D., Ph.D. \"We know that every time you put the blade to the skin you get pain.\" Smaller scars, minimal blood loss, less pain and faster recovery are among the advantages of minimally invasive surgery over conventional \"open\" methods. Surgeons avoid cutting deeply into the skin and underlying muscles, in - stead using retractors to groove a channel through fat pads. Back muscles can be pushed aside to allow slender tools to be manipulated without slicing through muscle. \"Spine surgeons try to relieve pain with the smallest possible inci - sion and the least possible damage to muscle,\" says Joseph Aferzon, M.D., of the Spine Center. \"Our goal is to create a portal for very thin instruments,\" he adds. \"We insert metal tubes of increasing diameter and gradually dilate a channel to the part of the spine we're trying to reach. The spine is a very complicated and hard-to-reach set of moving joints. One of the challenges in spine surgery is how to define outcomes, because people have high expectations and low tolerance for pain.\" When fluid leaks from a tear in the ring of cartilage between the vertebrae, the bulging disc can press painfully on the nerves around the spine. Dr. Aferzon performs an innovative procedure, called AxiaLIF, to fuse the deterio - rating vertebrae and stabilize the spine. \"The less muscle cut, the less pain,\" he says. \"There's also a much lower risk of infection and blood loss with minimally invasive tech - niques.\" \"Scars hurt,\" says Dr. Schwartz, adding that back surgery can leave lasting nerve damage that limits the spine's ability to bend. \"But the hospital keeps a specialized scrub team on call 24/7 because surgery can mean the difference between being paralyzed or walking again.\" Last summer, paramedics pulled a 21-year-old trauma victim from a car wreck and airlifted her broken body to Hartford Hospital. In the operating room, Dr. Schwartz re - lieved the pressure on her spinal cord by grafting bone and painstakingly removing fragments from burst fractures in her cervical spine. Although she was paraplegic when she arrived, after a day and a half in traction she could move her left arm. After three months of rehabilitation, she was able to stand. She recently walked into Dr. Schwartz's office. Except for some residual weakness in her right hand, she has completely recovered.

African American women are at particular risk for the disease, which accounts for one percent of all breast cancers. See your health care provider right away if you experience swelling, burning, heaviness, pain, redness and/or dimpling of the skin of the breast. Although bug bites, skin infections or injury may look similar, a breast surgeon can confirm a suspected diagnosis with a skin punch biopsy, mammography, ultrasound and/or MRI. Inflammatory breast cancer can also cause nipple discharge, swollen lymph nodes, an inverted or flattened nipple, rapid increase in breast size, discoloration and puckered skin that resembles an orange peel (peau d'orange) . \"Because this type of breast cancer can occur suddenly and spread swiftly, it is very important to seek health care as soon as pos - sible and follow up with a specialist if the first treatment is not effec - tive in curing the symptoms,\" says Nirupama Ann\u00e9, M.D., a breast surgeon with Connecticut Surgical Group's Center for Breast Care. \"Inflammatory breast cancer can be treated with chemotherapy to shrink the tumor and prevent its spread to other organs,\" she adds. \"Surgery to remove the cancer and affected lymph nodes may be followed by radiation and other therapies. Depending on the tumor, targeted drugs or hormonal therapy may help to prevent recurrence of the disease.\" The National Cancer Institute (NCI) en- courages inflammatory breast cancer patients to enroll in clinical trials of investigational drugs that may help improve survival. \"You can go to the NCI website to find out the criteria for a clinical trial,\" says Dr. Ann\u00e9. \"Hartford Hospital's team of medical and ra- diation oncologists can administer treatments in accordance with the clinical research protocols.\" Because inflammatory breast cancer is so aggressive and difficult to detect, it often isn't diagnosed until it metastasizes (spreads to other organs). Approximately 25-50 percent of those diagnosed with this fast-growing breast cancer survive for five years, compared to survival rates of more than 90 percent for postmenopausal breast cancers. Although it's widely believed that heredity is a significant cause of breast cancer, the National Institutes of Health says only about 5-10 percent of all breast cancers have a genetic link. Inflammatory breast cancer afflicts women\u2014and occasionally men\u2014who have no known risk factors for the disease. Many women have been alerted to the dangers of inflammatory breast cancer from news reports that have made the rounds on the Internet. Consult a physician if your breast suddenly feels swollen, heavy, warm or tender.Recognize Your Risk for Inflammatory Breast Cancer Toxic Waste Avoid the hype about colon cleansing, touted as a way to eliminate toxins. Don't send for so-called \"free\" trials of unnecessary\u2014and expensive\u2014herbs, probiot - ics or laxatives. Not only are you risking a credit card scam, but the American College of Gastroenterology warns that frequent colon cleansing can disrupt your body's electrolyte balance, causing dehydration, ane - mia, malnutrition and even heart failure.Brain Food Citicoline, a brain-boosting nutrient found in cauli - flower, soybeans, egg yolks, fish and peanuts, enhances the efficiency of the brain's frontal lobe\u2014the region responsible for judgment, critical thinking and work - ing memory. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is recruiting traumatic brain injury patients for a clinical trial, after an earlier study showed the vitamin-like compound reduced post- stroke neurological damage.C and E for Eyes A new study in the journal Ophthalmology suggests that older adults who eat a lot of citrus fruits, leafy greens, broccoli, high-fiber grains and fish oil may have a lower risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of vision loss among older Americans. Lutein (found in spinach and kale), vitamin C, vitamin E and zinc help protect against AMD, which afflicts more than 1 million Americans. 8Depression robs the mind of joy, leaving relationships in ruins. Despite the benefits of antidepressant drugs and cognitive therapy to change negative thought patterns, depression remains the number one cause of disability in the United States. For many sufferers, the quest for lasting relief is elusive. Feelings of loss or despair can be over - whelming and persistent. Although effective antidepressant drugs have been available since the mid-1950s, newer antidepressant medi - cations, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are easier to use than older drugs, which has led to the much wider use of antidepressants by primary care physicians. Millions of people around the world have been prescribed SSRIs, as well as both older and newer types of antidepressants. Although no one knows precisely how the drugs work, research shows that boosting the neurotrans - mitter serotonin seems to influence mood and behavior. While many people initially respond to treatment with SSRIs\u2014meaning that their symptoms improve\u2014most find that their depression never completely lifts. Depressed indi - viduals often suffer from personality disorders or substance abuse, heart disease or other medical problems, or feelings of helplessness, anger or anxiety. Available treatments don't work for as many as half of depressed patients. Side effects like sexual dysfunction often lead people to stop taking pharmaceuticals. \"Not everyone responds to antidepressant drugs,\" ex - plains John W. Goethe, M.D., director of the Burlingame Center for Psychiatric Research and Education at the Institute of Living. \"About a third of people get better with medication, but relapse within a few months. About 20 percent respond to a second medication, but no more than 10 percent respond to a fourth or fifth medication. So even without relapse, at least a third of people with depression are resistant to treatment.\" The Institute of Living is the first medical facility in Connecticut to offer the innovative NeuroStar transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) therapy that harnesses power - ful electromagnetic forces to treat depression gently and safely. Since the 1990s, brain mapping and bioengineer - ing studies have suggested that there might be a safe and effective way to stimulate neurotransmitters in the brain without the memory loss often caused by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), once known as electroshock. Last fall, the FDA approved the NeuroStar brain- stimulating device to treat depressed adults who have not responded to at least one antidepressant medication. The non-invasive procedure requires no anesthesia or sedation. The patient remains awake and alert during the treatment, a 40-minute outpatient procedure performed in a psychia - trist's office five days a week for four to six weeks.The American Journal of Psychiatry says TMS is as effec - tive as ECT in non-psychotic patients with major depres - sion, yet has significantly fewer side effects. In thousands of treatments during clinical trials, TMS was not associ - ated with weight gain, sexual problems, stomach problems, sleepiness, or dry mouth\u2014and there were no negative effects on memory or ability to concentrate. The treatment coil is applied to the head above the left prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain involved with mood regulation. \"Highly focused MRI-strength magnetic pulses gener - ate a weak electrical current that stimulates nerve cells in the area of the brain linked to depression,\" says Dr. Goethe. \"Although some individuals may initially experience a head - ache or scalp pain, it generally goes away after a few treat - ments. TMS is appropriate for people who can't take drugs or who have medical problems that rule out anesthesia.\" Patients whose physicians have recommended NeuroStar TMS therapy will be assigned a case manager who will work with them to secure coverage and insurance reimbursement for the experimental procedure.

Hartford Hospital is launching an effort to raise at least $3 million in charitable gifts for a groundbreaking initiative aimed at enabling people with depression, bipolar disorder or anxiety disorders to achieve not just improvement, but full, functional recovery.

Goethe, M.D., and Joanna H. Fogg-Waberski, M.D. 9When it comes to their health, just as in relationships, men and women might as well be from different planets. Men die earlier, but suffer fewer chronic autoimmune diseases like lupus, multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis. A woman's extra X chromosome gives her a com - petitive advantage in sex-linked traits like hemophilia, but she's more likely to suffer a fatal stroke. The National Stroke Association says that of the 700,000 Americans who suffer a stroke each year, 62 percent of those who die are women.Medical Myths and Misconceptions MYTH: Men Are Better Drivers than Women Neuroimaging studies reveal that although men and women are equally intelligent, their brains are very dif - ferent when it comes to driving and navigating. Women score higher on spatial recognition memory, attention span and motor control. Virtual reality simulations using functional mag - netic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveal major differences in the way men and women use their brains to escape from a three-dimensional maze. Women rely on landmarks to navigate, while men seem to have an internal compass. MYTH: Women Rarely Have Heart Attacks \"Gender matters when it comes to a heart attack,\" says James E. Dougherty, M.D., medical director of Hartford Hospital's heart transplant program. \"Men may be stoic, but they tend to ar - rive in the emergency department with classic symptoms of a heart attack\u2014 sweating and crushing chest pain. Women's symptoms are more subtle. Because women may have pain in the neck or elbow, the 'door to balloon' time\u2014how long it takes for angioplasty or a stent\u2014is longer. The good news is that half of young doctors are now fe - male, which has helped increase aware - ness and sensitivity to the very real differences between men and women.\"MYTH: Men Don't Get Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is not just a women's disease. Although elderly women out - number men, men lose bone mass just as fast as women after age 70. Each year in the United States, osteoporosis leads to two million fractures of the hip, spine and wrist. Up to 20 percent of hip fracture patients die within a year after the break and a quarter need long-term nursing home care. While women are twice as likely to break a hip, each year 90,000 men suffer a hip fracture and one-third die within a year afterward. 10MYTH: Women Can Smoke an Occasional Cigarette Although smoking is an equal opportuni - ty killer, women are particularly suscep - tible to the toxic effects of cigarette smoking, say researchers at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital. Now a new study of Norwegian smokers shows worse lung damage in women than in male smokers of similar age. Female smokers develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) earlier in life than men, possibly because their airways are smaller. Women are more likely than men to get lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death.MYTH: Women Don't Die from Stroke While estrogen appears to be protec - tive against stroke in lab animals, clinical trials in humans show that hormone replacement therapy could actually increase the risk of a stroke, say researchers at the University of Connecticut Health Center. \"More wom - en than men die from stroke annually in the United States,\" says Dr. James E. Dougherty. \"Stroke is the third-leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability, but 80 percent of strokes are preventable. Specific risks for women include oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, es - pecially in conjunction with cigarette smoking, abdominal girth and high triglyceride levels\u2014factors that are all potentially within our grasp to modify and control.\"MYTH: Men Don't Get Breast Cancer Men account for one percent of all breast cancers, or about 2,000 cases annually in the United States. The average age of onset is 65-67, a decade later than for female breast cancer. Men with breast cancer may have prior exposure to chest wall radiation (from treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma), or higher estrogen levels caused by Klinefelter's syndrome (an extra X chro - mosome), liver disease, obesity, alcohol abuse or a family history of testicular disease or breast cancer. Approximately 85-90 percent of male breast cancers have estrogen and progesterone recep - tors on their cell membrane, compared to only 60-70 percent of female breast cancers. Although men usually have a more advanced tumor stage at diagno - sis, overall survival rates for cancers caught at the same stage are compa - rable. MYTH: Men Have Heart Attacks During Sex Why do so many medical myths persist? Despite Hollywood dramas, men really aren't very likely to have a heart attack during sex. The typical 50-year-old non-smoking man has a one in a million chance of suffering a heart attack in any given hour, but having sex only raises those odds to a negligible two in a million. MYTH: Hormones Are Just for Women Fatigue, a depressed mood, low sex drive and erectile dysfunction may be treatable symptoms of low testosterone (Low T). Risk factors for Low T include obesity (especially around the abdo - men), diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, asthma and COPD. Hormone therapy is now available in the form of a patch or a gel that can be rubbed on the skin of the arms and shoulders.

Ingredients \u00bd c. tahini \u00bd c. agave nectar 1\u00bd c. rolled oats 1/3 c. dried cherries, raisins, cranberries or blueberries Preheat oven to 350\u00b0 F. Line a cookie sheet with parch- ment paper and set aside. Place the tahini and agave nectar in a large bowl and stir together. Stir in the oats and dried fruit. Drop the batter onto the lined cookie sheet using a teaspoon. Bake 10 minutes. Let the chews cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. Makes 24 cookies.

Serving size: 1 cookie Calories: 63 Carbohydrates: 9.5 g Protein: 1.5 gFat: 2 gFiber: 2.25 g Recipe analyzed by Heather Pascual, UConn Dietetic Program Intern. The recipe was analyzed using cranberries. Ground sesame seeds with a nutty flavor, rolled oats, and dried fruits\u2014 cherries, raisins or cranberries\u2014blend with the delicate sweetness of agave nectar to create a healthy and tasty treat. Agave (pronounced ah-GAH-vay) nectar comes from a plant known in Mexico as aguamiel, or \"honey water.\" The ancient Aztecs, who revered the liquid they believed had been bestowed by the gods, used agave syrup to sweeten both food and drink. Among its benefits as a sweetener is the fact that agave nectar does not cause a spike in blood sugar when ingested. It's the same plant used for tequila. Tahini, or sesame paste, is a solid source of calcium, protein and B vitamins, as well as essential fatty acids that keep skin youthful. Since tahini is fairly high in calories, it should be used in moderation, but it contains mostly unsaturated fats. Tahini also contains the amino acid methionine, which helps detoxify the liver. You'll find tahini in supermarkets, while agave nectar is easily found at a health foods store. Tahini chews* are not too sweet and can be consumed as a high-energy snack food. Beware of their addicting flavor while feeling good about their wholesome ingredients.Tahini Chews Address Service Requested "}
