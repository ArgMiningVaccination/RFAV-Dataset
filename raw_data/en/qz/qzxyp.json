During the interview, Dr. Gawande said that the value of today's physician does not depend solely on one's ability to discover or utilize the newest drug, device, procedure, or specialty. Instead, today's physician must also be an innovative leader who knows how to connect the dots on behalf of patients. How to use proven new models of collaborative care delivery that efficiently knit together the multidisciplinary talents and skills of everyone on the care team. In reviewing the selection of honorees for HHC Doctors' Day 2014, this observation could not be more apt. At every point across the continuum of care, this year's honorees -- and all the HHC physicians they represent -- are at the forefront of collaborative care delivery. From partnerships with parents to improve child health, to implementing disease prevention initiatives for adolescents, to reducing unnecessary use of psychotropic medications for behavioral health patients, to incorporating supportive palliative medicine strategies for serious illness or end of life care, HHC physicians are leading teams that are more effective than ever at promoting wellness, preventing illness, reducing pain and suffering, and mitigating disease processes. Please join us in congratulating our honorees, in reading about their accomplishments, and in saluting the hard work and dedication of all HHC physicians, as we celebrate HHC Doctors' Day 2014. We are proud of their leadership, their innovation, and their consistent provision of efficient, high-quality health services. Finally, we are grateful for the dedication of all our HHC physicians. You are doing great work on the front lines of medicine in New York City, bringing hope and healing to our patients and our communities. Every day, by living your work and believing in our mission, you remind us of what excellence in medicine means.

The program has already shown vastly improved clinical results, with significantly decreased sepsis mortality - an estimated 94 lives have been saved to date. Under the leadership of Dr. Evans, the Bellevue Sepsis Team earned the distinguished HHC President's Choice Award in 2013.

He develops training programs and uses huddles to teach and provide support for interdisciplinary team members. In doing so, he assists them in the provision of quality care, particularly in the management of difficult behaviors in special needs patients.

Doctors' Day Page 14 May 1, 2014 Page 15 Alexander Kolessa, MD The Residence at Gouverneur Court Given our small physician staff and their overall quality, we have previously chosen not to name a Doctor of the Year for our skilled nursing facility (SNF). However, Dr. Alexander Kolessa is one who clearly deserves such recognition. In 2013, he was the doctor of record enabling us to open and fill two sub-acute units. When our second full-time physician suffered an unexpected and prolonged medical leave, Dr. Kolessa assumed full responsibility, capably covering for several months with dedication and extraordinary energy. Dr. Kolessa has earned a reputation as Gouverneur's \"go-to\" physician for his colleagues and our nursing staff, as well as for the NYU fellows and Mercy College physician assistant students he supervises. Dr. Kolessa has made contributions in many areas. For example, he developed a new approach for documenting the initial history and physical that better supports the extraction of data for reporting performance on quality measures, as well as for determining reimbursement. In addition, his work has helped us to develop the capability to insert PICC-lines in the SNF. Dr. Kolessa was born in Ukraine and came to the United States in 1991. He graduated from the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in 2003. He first trained to be a surgeon, but recognized that he preferred the relationship with patients and the intellectual nature of internal medicine.

She is frequently consulted by Quality Management to participate in RCA interviews, or establish comprehensive timelines for complex cases, and represents the Department of Medicine when required.

Because of her outstanding leadership performance and her skills in quality and clinical care, Dr. Cousins was appointed Associate Director of Medicine in 2013. Most important is Dr. Cousins' excellent bedside manner. Her advice is frequently sought by her peers regarding difficult cases, and she serves as a role model for her Division and the entire Department of Medicine.
