The statue's location at a busy intersection between the Alpha Residential Learning Community, the Learning Commons, and Benson Memorial Center emphasizes Santa Clara's dedication to educating the whole person. Alumnus and Regent Jack Previte '70 conceived and spearheaded the project after being impressed by another statue created by artist David Spellerberg, owner of Great American Bronze Works Inc. Along with Previte, fellow donors Cyril G. Barbaccia, Joseph McCarthy '71, and Gary Filizetti '67, and the Bronco Bench Foundation made the statue possible. According to Previte, \"This statue represents the spirit and the grace and the power that we want Santa Clara University alumni and students to possess.\"iPREFACE The Undergraduate Bulletin contains the academic and administrative policies and regulations that govern enrollment of undergraduate students at Santa Clara University.

Inside Back Cover11 Santa Clara University Located in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, Santa Clara University is a comprehen - sive Jesuit, Catholic university with more than 8,800 students. Founded in 1851 by the Society of Jesus, California's oldest operating higher education institution offers a rigorous undergraduate curriculum in arts and sciences, business, and engineering, plus nationally recognized graduate and professional programs in business, law, engineering, education, counseling psychology, pastoral ministries, and theology. The University boasts a diverse community of scholars offering a values-oriented curriculum characterized by small class sizes and a dedication to educating students for competence, conscience, and compassion. The traditions of Jesuit education\u2014educating the whole person for a life of service\u2014run deep in all of its curricular and co-curricular programs. Santa Clara University is perennially ranked among the top comprehensive universities by U.S. News & World Report and has one of the highest graduation rates for undergraduate students among all comprehensive universities. The University has a national reputation for its undergraduate program that features a distinctive core curriculum, an integrated learning environment, and research opportunities for undergraduate students. The University was established as Santa Clara College on the site of the Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds, the eighth of the original 21 California missions. The college originally operated as a preparatory school and did not offer collegiate courses until 1853. Following the Civil War, enrollment increased, and by 1875 the size of the student body was 275. One-third of the students were enrolled in the collegiate division; the remainder attended the college's preparatory and high school departments. Santa Clara experienced slow and steady growth during its first 60 years, becoming the University of Santa Clara in 1912, when the schools of engineering and law were added. In 1925, the high school was separated from the University and took the name of Bellarmine College Preparatory in 1928. The Leavey School of Business opened in 1926, and within a decade, became one of the first business schools in the country to receive national accreditation. For 110 years, Santa Clara was an all-male school. In the fall of 1961, women were accepted as undergraduates, and Santa Clara became the first coeducational Catholic university in California. The decision resulted in an admissions explosion\u2014from 1,500 students to more than 5,000. The size of the faculty tripled, and the University began the largest building program in school history, building eight residence halls, a student union, and an athletic stadium. In 1985, the University adopted \"Santa Clara University\" as its official name.2 SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY VISION, MISSION, AND FUNDAMENTAL VALUES Santa Clara University has adopted three directional statements to describe the kind of university it aspires to become (Strategic Vision), its core purpose and the constituencies it serves (University Mission), and the beliefs that guide its actions (Fundamental Values). Strategic Vision Santa Clara University will educate citizens and leaders of competence, conscience, and compassion, and cultivate knowledge and faith to build a more humane, just, and sustainable world. University Mission The University pursues its vision by creating an academic community that educates the whole person within the Jesuit, Catholic tradition, making student learning our central focus, continuously improving our curriculum and co-curriculum, strengthening our schol - arship and creative work, and serving the communities of which we are a part in Silicon Valley and around the world. Student learning takes place at the undergraduate and graduate level in an educational environment that integrates rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagination, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. As an academic community, we expand the boundaries of knowledge and insight through teaching, research, artistic expression, and other forms of scholarship. It is primarily through discovering, communicating, and applying knowledge that we exercise our institu - tional responsibility as a voice of reason and conscience in society. We offer challenging academic programs and demonstrate a commitment to the devel - opment of: Undergraduate students who seek an education with a strong humanistic orientation in a primarily residential setting Graduate students, many of them working professionals in Silicon Valley, who seek advanced degree programs that prepare them to make significant contributions to their fields In addition to these core programs, we also provide a variety of continuing education and professional development opportunities for non-matriculated students. Fundamental Values The University is committed to these core values, which guide us in carrying out our mission and realizing our vision: Academic Excellence . We seek an uncompromising standard of excellence in teaching, learning, creativity, and scholarship within and across disciplines. Search for Truth, Goodness, and Beauty . We prize scholarship and creative work that advance human understanding, improve teaching and learning, and add to the betterment of society by illuminating the most significant problems of the day and exploring the endur - ing mysteries of life. In this search, our commitment to academic freedom is unwavering. Engaged Learning . We strive to integrate academic reflection and direct experience in the classroom and the community, especially to understand and improve the lives of those with the least education, power, and wealth.SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY 3 Commitment to Students . As teachers and scholars, mentors and facilitators, we endeavor to educate the whole person. We nurture and challenge students\u2014intellectually, spiritually, aesthetically, morally, socially, and physically\u2014preparing them for leadership and service to the common good in their professional, civic, and personal lives. Service to Others . We promote throughout the University a culture of service\u2014service not only to those who study and work at Santa Clara but also to society in general and to its most disadvantaged members as we work with and for others to build a more humane, just, faith-filled, and sustainable world. Community and Diversity . We cherish our diverse and inclusive community of students, faculty, staff, administrators, and alumni, a community that is enriched by people of differ - ent backgrounds, respectful of the dignity of all its members, enlivened by open communi - cation, and caring and just toward others. Jesuit Distinctiveness . We treasure our Jesuit heritage and tradition, which incorporates all of these core values. This tradition gives expression to our Jesuit educational mission and Catholic identity while also welcoming and respecting other religious and philosophical traditions, promoting the dialogue between faith and culture, and valuing opportunities to deepen religious beliefs. ACADEMIC PROGRAMS Santa Clara University offers undergraduate degrees leading to the bachelor of arts (B.A.), bachelor of science (B.S.), and bachelor of science in commerce.

The Department of Education focuses on preparing teachers and administrators for public and Catholic schools. It offers programs in teacher preparation leading to credentials (i.e., California preliminary multiple-subject and single- subject teaching credentials, and California Clear credential) and the master of arts in teach - ing (MAT) degree. Its programs in educational administration prepare public K-12 administrators (i.e., the Preliminary California Administrative Services credential and the California Clear Administrative Services credential), and Catholic school leaders through the certificate program in Catholic School Leadership. The department also offers a M.A. program in interdisciplinary education (with emphases in curriculum and instruction; science, technology, environmental education, and mathematics (STEEM); and educa - tional administration. The departments of Education and Counseling Psychology jointly offer the certificate program in Alternative and Correctional Education. The Department of Counseling Psychology offers two degree programs: M.A. in counseling psychology and M.A. in counseling. The M.A. in counseling psychology can lead to state licensure for marriage and family therapists and/or licensed professional clinical counselors. The depart - ment includes emphasis programs in health, correctional, and Latino counseling. The Jesuit School of Theology (JST) is one of only two Jesuit theological centers in the United States operated by the Society of Jesus, as the order of Catholic priests is known. It is one of only two Jesuit theological centers in the country that offer three ecclesiastical degrees certified by the Vatican Congregation for Catholic Education, and it also offers four advanced theological degrees certified by the Association of Theological Schools. In addi - tion, JST offers a spiritual renewal program for clergy, religious, and lay people, and con - ducts an annual Instituto Hispano that offers a certificate program to advance Hispanic leadership in the pastoral life of the church. CENTERS OF DISTINCTION Santa Clara University has three Centers of Distinction that serve as major points of interaction between the University and local and global communities. Each center focuses on a theme that is central to Santa Clara's distinctive mission as a Jesuit university and offers an educational environment integrating rigorous inquiry and scholarship, creative imagina - tion, reflective engagement with society, and a commitment to fashioning a more humane and just world. Each center engages faculty and students from different disciplines as well as experts and leaders from the community through speakers, conferences, workshops, and experiential learning opportunities. Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship The mission of the Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship is to accelerate global, innovation-based entrepreneurship in service to humanity. Through an array of programs including its signature Global Social Benefit Incubator (GSBI), the Center engages an international network of social enterprises, investment capital, and technical resources to build the capacity of the global social entrepreneurship movement. As a Center of Distinc - tion at Santa Clara University, the Center leverages its programs to inspire faculty and stu - dents with real-world case studies, distinctive curricula, and unique research opportunities, advancing the University's vision of creating a more just, humane, and sustainable world. More information can be found at www.scu-social-entrepreneurship.org.SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY 5 Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education The Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education promotes and enhances the distinctively Jesuit, Catholic tradition of education at Santa Clara University, with a view toward serving stu - dents, faculty, staff, and through them the larger community, both local and global. The Ignatian Center achieves this mission chiefly through four signature programs: Bannan Institutes provide yearlong thematic programs including academic events and scholarly activities that further the Jesuit, Catholic character of the University. Community-based learning places over 1,200 students each year with community partners, frequently in connection with an academic course. Immersion programs offer students, during academic breaks, the opportunity to experience local, domestic, and international communities with little access to wealth, power, and privilege. Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius provide opportunities for members of the com - munity to encounter the spiritual sources of the Jesuit tradition. Through these four programs, the Ignatian Center aspires to be recognized throughout Silicon Valley and beyond as providing leadership for the integration of faith, justice, and the intellectual life. Markkula Center for Applied Ethics The Markkula Center for Applied Ethics is one of the preeminent centers for research and dialogue on ethical issues in critical areas of American life. The center works with fac - ulty, staff, students, community leaders, and the public to address ethical issues more effec - tively in teaching, research, and action. The center's focus areas are business, health care and biotechnology, character education, government, global leadership, technology, and emerging issues in ethics. Articles, cases, briefings, and dialogue in all fields of applied ethics are available through the center. FACULTY Santa Clara University's emphasis on a community of scholars and integrated education attracts faculty members who are as committed to students' intellectual and moral develop - ment as they are to pursuing their own scholarship. The University's 530 full-time faculty members include Fulbright professors, nationally recognized authors, groundbreaking scientists , and distinguished economic theorists. STUDENT BODY Santa Clara University has a student population of 9,015, with 5,486 undergraduate students and 3,529 graduate students. The undergraduate population has a male-to-female ratio of 50-to-50, and about 45 percent of undergraduate students identify themselves as persons of color. About 62 percent of undergraduates are from California, with the others coming from throughout the United States and 44 countries. Seventy-four percent of undergraduate students receive some kind of financial aid\u2014scholarships, grants, or loans.6 SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY More than half (53%) of the undergraduate population live in University housing, with 90 percent of first-year students and 70 percent of sophomores living on campus. Students experience an average class size of 23, with 42 percent of classes having fewer than 20 students and only 1.6 percent of classes having 50 or more students. The student-to- faculty ratio is 12.16-to-1. The University's commitment to learning is expressed in the fact that 96.2 percent of first-year students advance to the sophomore year, and the percentage of Santa Clara students who graduate is among the highest in the country. The four-year graduation rate for entering first-year students is 78 percent, with a five-year graduation rate of 84 percent and a six-year graduation rate of 85.2 percent. ALUMNI Santa Clara University has over 94,000 alumni living in all 50 states and almost 100 countries. More than half of the alumni live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where many are leaders in business, law, engineering, academia, and public service. CAMPUS The University is located on a 106-acre campus in the city of Santa Clara near the south - ern end of the San Francisco Bay in one of the world's greatest cultural centers. More than 50 buildings on campus house 15 student residences, a main library, a law library, two stu - dent centers, the de Saisset Museum, extensive performing arts and athletic facilities, and a recreation and fitness center. Santa Clara's campus has the advantage of being located in Silicon Valley\u2014a region known for its extraordinary visionaries, who have designed and created some of the most significant scientific and technological advances of our age. Silicon Valley is more than a location -- it is a mindset, and home to more than 2 million residents and 6,600 science- and technology-related companies (not including San Francisco, which is located just an hour away). Santa Clara's campus is well known for its beauty and mission-style architecture. Newly opened in 2013, the brick-paved Abby Sobrato Mall leads visitors from the University's main entrance to the heart of campus\u2014the Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds . The roses and palm and olive trees of the Mission Gardens surround the historic Mission Church, which was restored in 1928. The adjacent Adobe Lodge is the oldest building on campus. In 1981, it was restored to its 1822 decor. Academic Facilities Amidst all this beauty and history are modern, world-class academic facilities. Students study and thrive in places such as the Joanne E. Harrington Learning Commons , Sobrato Family Technology Center , and Orradre Library where individuals and groups can study in an inviting, light-filled, and open environment. Notably, the library features an Auto - mated Retrieval System, a high-density storage area where up to 900,000 books and other publications can be stored and retrieved using robotic-assisted technology. Another example of Santa Clara's excellent academic facilities is Lucas Hall , home of the Leavey School of Business. This modern 85,000-square-foot building houses classrooms, meeting rooms, offices, study spaces, and a caf\u00e9. Classrooms are equipped with state-of- the-art videoconferencing equipment as well as a multi-platform system to record faculty lectures for later review by students. Vari Hall (formerly Arts & Sciences), adjacent to Lucas Hall, is home to the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics as well as academic departments, SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY 7 classrooms, and a 2,200-square-foot digital television studio, regarded as among the best studios found on any campus nationwide. Located near Vari Hall (formerly Arts & Sciences) is the Schott Admission and Enroll - ment Services Building , a welcome center for campus visitors and home to several Univer - sity departments. Opened in 2012, the lobby of this green-certified structure includes technology-infused exhibits that illustrate Santa Clara's Jesuit mission. Among other green features on campus are two solar-powered homes built in 2007 and 2009 for the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon. Both homes now serve as laboratories for solar and sustainability technologies. Student Life Santa Clara has 10 on-campus residence halls, most with traditional double rooms and large common bathrooms; others with suite arrangements conducive to more informal living. Juniors and seniors can apply for townhouse-style living in the 138-unit University Villas across from the main campus. Opened in 2012, Graham Hall is Santa Clara's newest resi - dence hall. The environmentally friendly building boasts 96 mini-suites, lounges, full kitchens, and laundry facilities for every eight-room \"neighborhood.\" In addition, the residence hall has two classrooms, a small theater, outdoor barbecue and picnic areas, and a large courtyard. The Robert F. Benson Memorial Center serves as a hub for campus life. The Benson Center offers dining services and houses the campus bookstore, the campus post office, and meeting rooms. The University's main dining hall, The Marketplace, resembles an upscale food court with numerous stations and options. For a more informal experience, The Bronco is the Benson Center's late-night venue, serving beverages and pub-style food. Another hot-spot for student life, the Paul L. Locatelli, S.J., Student Activity Center , includes a 6,000 square-foot gathering hall with a high ceiling that can accommodate dances and concerts as well as pre- and postgame activities. Designed with environmental sensitivity, the building is energy efficient and has daytime lighting controls and motion sensors to maximize use of natural light. For fitness-minded students, the Pat Malley Fitness and Recreation Center features a 9,500-square-foot weight training and cardiovas - cular exercise room, three basketball courts, a swimming pool, and other facilities to support the recreational and fitness needs of the campus community. The campus includes many locations for quiet reflection such as the St. Clare Garden , which features plants and flowers arranged into five groups to portray the stages of the saint's life. For campus members who want a more hands-on relationship with nature, the Forge Garden , SCU's half-acre organic garden, serves as a campus space for course research, service learning, and sustainable food production. Athletics and the Arts The importance of athletics to the University is evident everywhere on campus. Among the newest additions to Santa Clara's athletics facilities are the Stephen Schott Stadium , home field for the men's baseball team, and the state-of-the-art Stevens Soccer Training Center funded by a gift from Mary and Mark Stevens. The gift from the Stevenses will also allow Santa Clara to upgrade the stands in Stevens Stadium (formerly Buck Shaw Stadium), home to the men's and women's soccer programs, and build a plaza that will celebrate Bronco sports\u2014its past, present, and future. The plaza will celebrate the history of Santa Clara University football as well as the legacy and future of men's and women's soccer at SCU. Bellomy Field , eight acres of well-lit, grassy playing fields, provides space for club and intramural sports such as rugby and field hockey. Adjacent to Bellomy Field is the 8 SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY well-appointed women's softball field, which opened in 2013. The Leavey Event Center houses the University's premier basketball facility. Over the years, the Leavey Event Center has hosted nine West Coast Conference Basketball Championships. The University recognizes the arts as an equally important part of life at Santa Clara University. The new Edward M. Dowd Art and Art History Building (scheduled to open in 2016) will house an integrated fine arts program that will be a destination and a center for inspiration, innovation, and engagement in the arts and art history in Silicon Valley. The de Saisset Museum , the University's accredited museum of art and history, presents changing art exhibitions throughout the year and serves as the caretaker of the University's California History Collection, which includes artifacts from the Native American, Mission, and early Santa Clara College periods. SCU Presents represents the University's commitment to the performing arts on campus, which include performances at venues such as the Louis B. Mayer Theatre , the Fess Parker Studio Theatre , and the Music Recital Hall . The Mayer Theatre is Santa Clara University's premier theatrical venue, housing 500 intimate seats in either a flexible proscenium or thrust-stage setting. The Fess Parker Studio Theatre has no fixed stage or seating. Its black- box design, complete with movable catwalks, provides flexibility in an experimental setting. The 250-seat Music Recital Hall provides a contemporary setting where students, faculty, and guest artists offer a variety of performances.92 T ransformative Experiences and Learning Resources Santa Clara University is committed to the education of the whole person in the Jesuit and Catholic tradition with a vision of developing men and women to be leaders of compe - tence, conscience, and compassion. The undergraduate program is designed for students who seek an education that integrates Jesuit values and learning that prepares them for 21st century challenges in a primarily residential setting. Varied educational experiences encourage students to value differing ways of knowing and being in the world, different forms of knowledge within established disciplines, and new knowledge as well as that which pre - ceded it. Santa Clara's concept of the \"whole person\" inevitably embraces our social nature. When he inaugurated Santa Clara's sesquicentennial year in 2000, Father Peter-Hans Kolvenbach, then superior general of the Society of Jesus, noted that \"Tomorrow's 'whole person' cannot be whole without an educated awareness of society and culture with which to contribute socially, generously, in the real world.\" Affirming that the Jesuit educational standard must always \"educate the whole person of solidarity for the real world,\" he explained: \"Students, in the course of their formation, must let the gritty reality of this world into their lives, so they can learn to feel it, think about it critically, respond to its suffering, and engage in it constructively. They should learn to perceive, think, judge, choose, and act for the rights of others, especially the disadvantaged and the oppressed.\" Since then, Santa Clara University has revised the Core Curriculum, begun implementing a new strategic plan, extended the impact of its Centers of Excellence, and enhanced the University's co-curricular programs, all with the goal of educating students who will apply what they are learning to constructive engagement with the gritty realities of the 21st century. The Santa Clara undergraduate program offers courses and other learning experiences whose content and patterns combine the acquisition and creation of knowledge with the quest for meaning and purpose. Santa Clara's learning environments encourage students to make connections across the Core Curriculum, the academic major, elective courses, and co-curricular experiences. Students are encouraged to relate their classroom learning with out-of-classroom learning through community-based education, Residential Learning Communities, Campus Ministry, a wide variety of student organizations, athletics and rec - reation, and other experiences. In a more general way, the undergraduate program nurtures students' ability to knit the intellectual, social, moral, spiritual, creative, and behavioral aspects of life into a coherent and meaningful whole.10 TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES THE CORE CURRICULUM A university expresses its most basic values in its Core Curriculum that is part of an undergraduate education required of all students. Santa Clara's Core Curriculum explicitly integrates three traditions of higher education. As a Catholic university, it is rooted in the tradition of pursuing an understanding of God through the free exercise of reason. As a Jesuit university, it promotes a humanistic education that leads toward an ethical engage - ment with the world. As a comprehensive American university committed to liberal educa - tion, Santa Clara seeks to prepare its students for intelligent, responsible, and creative citizenship. Reflecting these traditions, the Core Curriculum provides every undergraduate with the common learning that all students need to become leaders of competence, con - science, and compassion. The distinctiveness of a Santa Clara education emerges in the Core Curriculum, both in its sense of purpose rooted in the University's traditions and in its commitment to a breadth of learning for the 21st century that complements and supports all majors. The Core Curriculum opens students to the study and practice of the arts, humanities, mathematics, technology, natural sciences, and social sciences. It educates students for interdisciplinary understanding and ethically informed participation in civic life. Opportunities for experiential learning foster the development of compassion and atten - tion to the ways human suffering can be alleviated. Reflecting the University's founding mission, the Core Curriculum includes a disciplined and critical reflection on the religious dimensions of human existence. In addition, because the Core Curriculum continually highlights the critical and compelling questions facing individuals and communities, the Core Curriculum supports students both in making professional career choices and in discerning their larger vocation\u2014their life's purpose in the world. Learning Goals: What will students learn in the Core Curriculum? Because a liberal education in the Jesuit tradition is oriented toward particular ends, the Core Curriculum affirms a set of central learning goals. These goals are divided among three broad categories\u2014Knowledge, Habits of Mind and Heart, and Engagement with the World. Knowledge To be prepared for well-informed engagement in society, students must comprehend the forces that have shaped the world they have inherited and the ways the world is interpreted and understood. They must also understand how they might transform the world for the better. The Core Curriculum deepens students' knowledge of the ideas and ways of knowing that emerge from the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences. Global Cultures : The intertwined development of global ideas, institutions, religions, and cultures, including Western cultures Arts and Humanities : The production, interpretation, and social influence of the fine and performing arts, history, languages, literatures, philosophy, and religion Scientific Inquiry : The principles of scientific inquiry and how they are applied in the natural and social sciences Science and Technology : The formative influences, dynamics, social impacts, and ethical consequences of scientific and technological developmentTRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES 11 Diversity : Diverse human experiences, identities, and cultures within local and global societies, especially as formed by relations of power and privilege Civic Life : The roles, rights, and responsibilities of citizens and institutions in societies and in the world Habits of Mind and Heart To contribute to a rapidly changing, complex, and interdependent world, students must develop ways of thinking, feeling, and acting that allow them to educate themselves for the rest of their lives with passion and purpose. By attending to the cognitive and affective dimensions of human experience, the Core Curriculum enables students to think more deeply, imagine more freely, and communicate more clearly. Critical Thinking : The ability to identify, reflect upon, evaluate, integrate, and apply different types of information and knowledge to form independent judgments Mathematics and Quantitative Reasoning : Analytical and logical thinking and the habit of drawing conclusions based on quantitative information Complexity : An approach to understanding the world that appreciates ambiguity and nuance as well as clarity and precision Ethical Reasoning : Drawing on ethical traditions to assess the consequences of indi - vidual and institutional decisions Religious Reflection : Questioning and clarifying beliefs through critical inquiry into faith and the religious dimensions of human existence Communication : Interacting effectively with different audiences, especially through writing, speech, and a second language Engagement with the World To engage with the world in meaningful ways, students need opportunities to explore and refine self-knowledge in relation to others. The Core Curriculum enhances students' understanding of the integrity of their own lives and the dignity inherent in the lives of others, especially the impoverished, suffering, and marginalized. Perspective : Seeking out the experience of different cultures and people, striving to view the world through their eyes Collaboration : The capacity to collaborate intellectually and creatively with diverse people Social Justice : Developing a disciplined sensibility toward the causes of human suffering and misery, and a sense of responsibility for addressing them Civic Engagement : Addressing major contemporary social issues, including environ - mental sustainability and peaceful resolution of conflict, by participating actively as an informed citizen of society and the world Each course in the Core Curriculum addresses at least three of the learning goals listed above. Students have multiple opportunities to encounter, practice, and master each learn - ing goal. In addition, specific learning objectives for each area of the Core Curriculum have been developed by faculty Core Curriculum committees. These learning objectives are asso - ciated with particular learning goals and describe the knowledge, skills, and values students will be able to demonstrate after completing the courses in the Core Curriculum. 12 TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES The learning objectives are posted on the Core Curriculum website and published annually in the Core Curriculum Guide . The structure of the Core features two phases of coursework designed to foster develop - mental learning and curricular coherence. The first phase, Foundations , consists of six to nine courses normally taken in the first year, introducing students to the processes and expectations for university-level education: Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2 Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 Second Language (level required varies by major) Mathematics (one course selected from a variety of choices) Religion, Theology & Culture 1 This phase helps students begin to set their own goals for learning, preparing them to make thoughtful choices in the Core Curriculum, their majors, and co-curricular activities. The second phase, Explorations , offers students the opportunity to choose among courses that will expand and deepen their understanding of a broad range of subject areas needed for effective participation in contemporary life. The 10 Explorations requirements\u2014 Ethics; Science, Technology & Society; Cultures & Ideas 3; Religion, Theology & Culture 2; and Religion, Theology & Culture 3\u2014include many courses that also satisfy requirements in students' majors. Students in Arts and Sciences and Business satisfy their Core Foundation and Exploration requirements with one course per Core area. Engineering students may satisfy more than one Core requirement with one course when the course has been approved for those Core areas. The Integrations requirements\u2014Experiential Learning for Social Justice, Advanced Writing, and Pathways\u2014often are components embedded in other courses rather than additional courses. Pathways foster integrative, intentional learning, complement the majors, and encourage the application of knowledge to real problems in the world. Students select one of 24 different Pathways before they attain junior status. Pathways allow students to integrate their learning across at least two different disciplines by choosing one of the following from a wide range of themes: American studies; applied ethics; beauty; children, family, studies; democracy; design thinking; the digital age; food, hun - ger, poverty, and the environment; gender, globalization, and empire; gender, sexuality, and the body; global health; human rights in a global world; Islamic studies; justice and the arts; law and social justice; leading people, organizations, and social change; paradigm shifts; politics and religion; public policy; race, place, and social inequalities; sustainability; values in science and technology; and vocation. Students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business must complete four Pathway courses; students in the School of Engineering must complete three Pathway courses. Beyond the coursework, all students must earn a passing grade on a Pathway reflection essay. Student progress through the structure of the Core Curriculum is not strictly sequential, from Foundations through Explorations to Integrations . While some courses (e.g., Critical Thinking & Writing 1 and 2; Cultures & Ideas 1, 2, and 3; and Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, and 3) must be taken in sequence, all students have the opportunity to dis - cover other sequences that are best for their individual undergraduate experience. At the same time, all students engage in coursework designed to help them achieve the shared set of learning objectives for each component of the Core Curriculum. Furthermore, the TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES 13 Experiential Learning for Social Justice, Advanced Writing, and Pathways components of the Core Curriculum help students experience requirements not only as individual courses but as related educational activities that help structure and integrate their entire experience of university study. The Core Curriculum Guide provides more detailed information about each component of the Core Curriculum, the learning goals and objectives associated with each component, and the courses from which students may choose. An online version is available at www.scu.edu/core. Students are encouraged to check their degree audit in eCampus regularly to determine their progress in the Core Curriculum and their other academic requirements. The Core Curriculum and the College of Arts and Sciences Students in the College of Arts and Sciences should consult Chapter 3 for the require - ments for their majors. There are no additional college-wide requirements beyond the requirements for the Undergraduate Core Curriculum. The Core Curriculum and the Leavey School of Business Leavey School of Business requirements determine how students in the business school satisfy some Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements\u2014some Core Curriculum requirements must be fulfilled with specific courses. Students in the Leavey School of Business should consult Chapter 4 for the complete list of requirements for the majors and the school. The Core Curriculum Guide provides additional information. The Core Curriculum and the School of Engineering Students in the School of Engineering satisfy their mathematics and natural science requirement with courses required by their majors; their second language requirement is met by Santa Clara's entrance requirements. Some sections of Core courses in Social Science, Diversity, Cultures & Ideas 3, and Religion, Theology & Culture 2 and 3 will allow engi - neering students to satisfy two requirements with one course, with the understanding that other coursework for their majors will complete the acquisition of knowledge and skills required in the Core. Engineering students will complete their Pathways with three courses. Transfer Credit and the Core Curriculum T ransfer credit earned from courses completed after initial enrollment at Santa Clara may not be used to fulfill Core Curriculum or other requirements. T ransfer credit earned from courses completed before enrollment at Santa Clara are gov - erned by two sets of rules, one for students admitted as first-year students and another for transfer students. All students must satisfy the following Core requirements at Santa Clara University: Civic Engagement; Science, Technology & Society; a minimum of two Religion, Theology & Culture courses; Advanced Writing; Experiential Learning for Social Justice; and Pathways. Students admitted as first-year students must also satisfy Critical Thinking & Writing and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 with courses completed at Santa Clara University. In contrast, students admitted as transfers are encouraged to complete Critical Thinking & Writing and Cultures & Ideas 1 and 2 before their first quarter at Santa Clara. For transfer students only, transfer credit for Critical Thinking & Writing may include exemptions granted at other schools and credit granted through Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate test scores. Information about possible substitutions for Critical Thinking & Writing and Cultures & Ideas courses is available in the Registrar's Office.14 TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES T ransfer students who enter the University with fewer than 44 units must take all three Religion, Theology & Culture courses in the required sequence. Students matriculating with 44 or more units of transferable college credit, which does not include any Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate test credit, complete two courses from any two of the following three categories, in any order: Religion, Theology & Culture 1, 2, or 3. However, all students except Religious Studies majors and minors must complete 88 units before enrolling in Religion, Theology & Culture 3 courses. T ransfer students must declare their Pathways by the end of their third quarter at SCU. T ransfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with fewer than 44 units must take four courses to fulfill the Pathways require - ment. T ransfer students in the College of Arts and Sciences and Leavey School of Business who matriculate with more than 44 units must take three courses to fulfill the Pathways requirement. All transfer students in the School of Engineering must take three courses to fulfill the Pathways requirement. More detailed Pathway guidelines are available at www.scu.edu/Pathways. Students who transfer to Santa Clara University should consult Chapters 7 and 8 as well as the chapters relevant to their school or college. THE RESIDENTIAL EXPERIENCE The undergraduate residence halls at Santa Clara University are home to eight Residential Learning Communities established to foster integrated education within a community of scholars. By creating a culture in which students connect their academic experiences with their social and residential ones, the learning communities enhance the education of the whole person and deepen the connection between learning and living as responsible mem - bers of a community. All entering first-year students, whether or not they live on campus, become members of one of eight theme-based Residential Learning Communities. Nonresident first-year stu - dents are given access to the residence hall in which their learning community is located so that they can participate fully in its programs. In the theme-based learning communities, resident directors and faculty directors coordinate the efforts of resident ministers and student staff to encourage high academic achievement, effective community living, and individual development. Students take at least one Core Foundations sequence in common with others in their learning community, enriching coursework and promoting the formation of study groups. Students also interact directly with faculty and staff and participate in theme-based co-curricular and extracurricular activities both on and off campus. Residential Learning Communities are primarily two-year communities, but some offer the opportunity for students to remain throughout their undergraduate careers. University residence halls accommodate more than half of the undergraduate population in coeducational communities with common lounge areas, study rooms, kitchen and laun - dry facilities, and other services. Most residence halls offer traditional double-occupancy rooms with common bath facilities; some halls offer suites and apartment-style accommo - dations with bathrooms en suite. All residence hall rooms and suites are equipped with a cable television connections, Ethernet, and wireless network service.TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES 15 CAMPUS MINISTRY Campus Ministry is comprised of people who are committed to spiritual and personal growth. Its mission is to foster the spiritual life of our students. In support of the University's mission to \"development of the whole person,\" Campus Ministry offers a variety of programs and pastoral presence to support that develop - ment, particularly the spiritual and personal aspects. Campus Ministry provides a welcoming environment where faith may be explored, discovered, and developed; a place where there is always someone to talk to about anything; and a place where people meet for small groups, prayer, reflection, and learning. More than 400 students attend weekly worship, and even more students are involved in Campus Ministry programs. In addition to eight full-time campus ministers, there are also resident ministers living in residence halls on campus. What does Campus Ministry have to offer?

Yes! We welcome the participation of anyone interested in spiritual and personal growth, regardless of faith tradition. This is a time for learning about yourself and our world, and we hope we can accompany you in that exploration.16 TRANSFORMA TIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT The University Strategic plan has prioritized global engagement and understanding. As a result there are a number of programs throughout the university that offer students the opportunity to engage with the world as part of their academic program. The Global Engagement Office (GEO) provides leadership, coordination, strategic planning, and resources for the internationalization of the campus. GEO offers programs and services that enhance global learning at Santa Clara University, which includes the two largest global programs at the University: the SCU Study Abroad program, and the International S tudents & Scholars (ISS) program. In addition to these programs, GEO provides information on diverse international programs throughout the University. The ISS program supports the education and development of undergraduate and gradu - ate international students to enable them to achieve excellence in their academic and profes - sional goals. In addition, ISS promotes the understanding of diverse cultures and perspectives throughout the University and provides support to international students of all kinds. ISS also manages the F-1 and J-1 visa programs and provides support to students on visa-related matters. SCU STUDY ABROAD As part of the SCU Study Abroad program, undergraduate students may apply to over 150 approved programs in over 60 locations with opportunities to study during fall, winter, spring, and summer. Courses completed in approved SCU Study Abroad programs count toward elective credit requirements for graduation and may fulfill major, minor, and Core requirements with the prior approval from the department or the Core director. SCU Study Abroad values diversity and inclusion and strongly encourages students from all back- grounds to apply for study abroad. For more information on the SCU Study Abroad program, see Chapter 6. CAREER CENTER The Career Center provides students with a variety of services and resources to encour - age self-discovery, provide a meaningful vocational journey, and educate for the continuous process of career and life development. Students explore their majors and career choices with counselors to reflect on attributes such as personality, skills, interests, and values, and learn to represent those attributes effectively on resumes, in cover letters, during interviews, and throughout the life of their careers. The Career Center offers a variety of programs and services each year, including career fairs, employer information sessions, classes and work - shops on career strategies, resume writing and interview webinars, internship workshops, mock interviews, and appointments with career counselors. A critical piece of educating for life is on- and off-campus student employment positions, internships, cooperative educa - tion placements, and volunteer opportunities. Positions are posted through the Career Center's BroncoLink online job listing and are accessible to students via eCampus. The Career Center also disseminates information through its Web presence including Facebook, BroncoLink, and LinkedIn. For undergraduate students interested in pursuing graduate study, the Career Center offers a Resource Guide to Graduate School on its website.TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES 17 CAMPUS RECREATION Campus Recreation is committed to the Jesuit ideal of developing the whole person through a broad range of recreational, educational, and competitive opportunities that seek to enrich the lives of students, faculty, and staff.

As a program, Santa Clara has won 59 WCC titles across eight sports and has been to the NCAA tournament 92 times with a total of 18 Final Four appearances. The men's and women's soccer teams are perennially among the nation's elite programs, both having won national championships. Men's soccer took home its national title in 1989 when current head coach, Cam Rast, was a star on the team. Jerry Smith has led the women's soccer team for over 28 years and has taken the team to 24 NCAA tournaments and 10 Final Fours. In 2001, Smith led the Broncos all the way to the program's national title. Women's volleyball has also emerged in recent years as one of the nation's top programs. In 2005, the Broncos volleyball team made an incredible run to the Final Four under c urrent head coach, John Wallace. Men's basketball has also had much success on the court. The team went to the final four in 1952 and was home to former National Basketball Association (NBA) star, Kurt Rambis, and current NBA player and two-time Most Valuable Player (MVP) winner, Steve Nash. As a first-year student, Nash led Santa Clara back to the NCAA tournament for the first time in five years and an upset of second-seeded Arizona. In all, Santa Clara went to the tourna - ment three times in Nash's four years on the Mission campus. In 2011, Santa Clara men's basketball returned to the postseason for the first time since Nash graduated and took part in the CollegeInsider.com Tournament. The Broncos, led by the nation's top three-point shooter, Kevin Foster, went all the way to collect the tournament title. The team then captured the College Basketball Invitational postseason tournament in 2013.18 TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES The women's basketball team has had success in the postseason as well, bringing home the 1991 Women's National Invitation Tournament (WNIT) championship. Not to be outdone, Bronco baseball has had tremendous success with the high point coming in 1962 when the team went all the way to Omaha and the College World Series title game. The team featured eight future major league players, including three who went straight from Santa Clara to the big leagues. In 2014, the Broncos advanced to the WCC tournament, which was the first post-season appearance since 1997. One of the most famous Santa Clara baseball players, Randy Winn, started as Steve Nash's backup at point guard on the basketball team. Winn played 13 seasons in the major leagues including five for the San Francisco Giants. With a long tradition of turning out professional baseball players, the Broncos have had over 158 players taken in the major league baseball draft. The Broncos also have some of the best athletic facilities in the country including Stephen Schott Stadium that opened in 2005, the Sullivan Aquatic Center that opened in 2008, the Degheri Tennis Center that opened in 1999, and the Leavey Center that was renovated in 2002.

The University Honors Program requires that all participants maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.3 or higher, and Level I participants must successfully complete a minimum of six pro - gram courses within the first six quarters of enrollment. Most participants complete Level I during their first year. Unless exempted by the director, Level I participants must fulfill specific Foundations courses in the Core Curriculum\u2014Critical Thinking & Writing; Cul - tures & Ideas; and Religion, Theology & Culture\u2014through special class sections arranged by the program. Participants are also strongly urged to satisfy Core Curriculum require - ments such as mathematics, ethics, social sciences, natural sciences, advanced writing, and advanced Religion, Theology & Culture with Honors Program sections. Participants in Level I normally continue to Level II, in which they complete a mini - mum of four additional program courses including a senior thesis or project. Students who have completed 32 or more units but not more than 88 units at Santa Clara may apply to enter Level II by contacting the Honors Program Office. Students joining the program at Level II complete six program courses including the thesis or senior project. Some Level II courses, while not limited to program participants, offer academic opportunities especially suitable for them. For both continuing and new participants, the thesis usually grows out of TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES 21 a regular or independent study course taken in conjunction with the participant's major, minor, or Pathway. Successful completion of the program at Level II becomes part of a student's permanent record and appears on academic transcripts issued by the University. Honors Program students have the opportunity to participate in the Honors Advisory Council. The University Honors Program is allied with the Office of Student Fellowships, which helps prepare students to compete for nationally competitive graduate fellowships such as Rhodes, Marshall, Fulbright, Mitchell, Goldwater, Udall, Jack Kent Cooke, and Gates Cambridge. A competitive annual award permits one Honors Program student to spend his or her junior year at Mansfield College, Oxford University. For information about courses offered through the University Honors Program, see Chapter 6. LEAD SCHOLARS PROGRAM The LEAD (Leadership, Excellence, and Academic Development) Scholars Program provides first-generation University students admitted to the program with a smooth transi - tion to life at Santa Clara. The LEAD Scholars Program forms a community of undergradu - ate peers and faculty dedicated to rigorous academic achievement, student leadership, community engagement and service. The program involves support as well as challenge throughout the four years, with a special emphasis on the first-year experience. All LEAD scholars participate in LEAD Week, which is scheduled for the week immediately preceding the beginning of the fall term. Incoming first-year students take ENGL 1A and 2A together, and well as two LEAD Seminars, which focus on optimizing the transition to college. T rans - fer students take an upper-division seminar, which focuses on opportunities and challenges for transfer students. Other optional courses are also offered for the LEAD Scholars com - munity, and students have access to a range of resources. LEAD Scholars can also participate in the LEAD Council, a leadership group that pro - vides programs, events, and other opportunities to serve the needs of the LEAD commu - nity. A range of social and academic programs are offered including alumni networking, community building events and outreach to families. For more information about courses offered by the LEAD Scholars Program, please refer to Chapter 6. OFFICE OF FELLOWSHIPS The Office of Fellowships at Santa Clara was established in 2005 to provide the central management and administrative responsibility for advising students about a wide variety of highly competitive external fellowships, scholarships, awards, and prizes requiring univer - sity nomination, endorsement, or review. The Office of Fellowships mentors and advises students about their academic, service, and volunteer work in pursuit of the more than 25 named fellowships for which Santa Clara students are eligible (Rhodes, Marshall, Ful - bright, Madison, T ruman, and Jack Kent Cooke, for example) as well as provides direct support for potential candidates in the application process. The Office of Fellowships responds to two principles of Jesuit education. The first, cura personalis , personal care, reflects a deep respect for the individual and that person's potential. The second, magis , \"striving for the more,\" calls on students to do their very best and always to strive for personal excellence. The Office of Fellowships will help intellectually gifted Santa Clara students to develop and to utilize their talents so that they have more to give to others.22 TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES PEER EDUCATOR PROGRAM Created in 1997 as an experiment in enhancing student learning, the Peer Educator Program is designed to facilitate and enrich the learning supported by undergraduate instruction at Santa Clara University. Peer Educators are students who help a faculty mem - ber with the administration of a class. More specifically, the Peer Educator Program aims to Enhance and enrich the learning experiences of peer educators through close collabo - ration with a faculty member Enhance and enrich learning in undergraduate courses, especially lower-division university and school core courses Contribute to the residential learning community initiative to increase awareness of the close relationships between experiential and classroom learning and cultivate a frame of mind conducive to lifelong learning Support faculty initiatives to develop and implement pedagogies that further other goals of the program and of the university DOMESTIC PUBLIC SECTOR STUDIES PROGRAMS The Public Sector Studies Program at Santa Clara University offers an introduction to the areas traditionally known as public policy, public administration, public affairs, and urban planning. It is designed to provide a closer look at the creation, implementation, and analysis of public policies, and the operation of government, public, and nonprofit organi - zations. The program also provides an excellent foundation for those who would like to pursue graduate studies in public policy or public administration and an alternative per - spective for students who wish to pursue public law. Opportunities for Firsthand Study Through the Public Sector Studies program in the Department of Political Science, students have the opportunity to participate in public sector internships, the Washington Semester Program, and the Panetta Institute's Congressional Internship program. These programs offer preparation and training for students interested in working at the city, county, state, or federal level of government, in a public agency or nonprofit organization, or considering graduate-level studies in related fields. Internships Perhaps the best way to understand is by doing\u2014students participating in public sector internships not only observe what happens in the \"real world,\" but they are able to take part as well, gaining invaluable experience and knowledge. Placements in public sector intern - ships have included the San Jose mayor's and City Council members' offices, district offices of members of Congress and the California Legislature, government relations departments of high-tech corporations, public law offices including the Santa Clara county Public Defender and District Attorney, political campaigns, and nonprofit organizations. Many students end their internships with excellent employment prospects. The Washington Semester Program In the Washington Semester Program, students combine coursework taken at American University with hands-on experience via internships. In the past, SCU students have interned at the White House, the Justice Department, the FBI, interest groups, broadcast TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES 23 news stations, various nonprofit organizations, and offices of members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The Washington Semester Program offers students the opportunity to live, study, and work in our nation's capital for one semester along with students from other U.S. states and from countries abroad. Numerous programs of study are available, including American Politics, Public Law, U.S. Foreign Policy, International Environment and Devel - opment, Economic Policy, Journalism, International Business and T rade, Peace and Conflict Resolution, and Contemporary Islam. Several programs include a three-week international travel component along with study in Washington. Students participating in the Washing - ton Semester Program earn 22.5 to 24 quarter credits for one semester of study. Grades and units received at American University will count toward the student's SCU grade point aver - age and course requirements for the department and the University when appropriate. The Panetta Institute's Congressional Internship Program The Leon and Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy at California State University, Monterey Bay, founded by Santa Clara political science alumnus Leon Panetta, offers an opportunity for students to gain an inside look at the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government and Washington politics. This Congressional internship begins with a two- week course at California State University, Monterey Bay, where students work directly with seasoned veterans examining the legislative process and its functions. The remaining two- and-a-half months of the internship are spent in Washington, D.C., working on Capitol Hill in the office of a member of the California Congressional delegation. One exceptional Santa Clara University student is chosen each year for this fully subsidized internship. Eligibility To be eligible to participate in one of these Public Sector Studies Programs, students must have completed at least 88 quarter units of credit by the date that the program of study begins, must not be on academic or disciplinary probation, and must be in good financial standing with the University. Students must also meet grade point average and other eligi - bility requirements for the specific program. For more information about the Public Sector Studies Program, visit the Public Sector Studies Program at www.scu.edu/cas/polisci/publicsector.cfm or contact the director of the Public Sector Studies Program. ACADEMIC ADVISING AND LEARNING RESOURCES The John B. Drahmann Academic Advising and Learning Resources Center coordinates academic support services for undergraduate students. University advisors in the Drahmann Center work closely with faculty and staff in the Residential Learning Communities, the deans' offices, the Cowell Center, the Career Center, the Office for Multicultural Learning, and the Center for Student Leadership to ensure that academic advising and other academic support services are integrated for the benefit of students. Santa Clara University follows a developmental advising model based on a close student- faculty advisor relationship intended to assist students with achieving their educational, career, and personal goals through the use of the full range of institutional resources. The Drahmann Center provides training for faculty advisors through new faculty advisor workshops and ongoing training to keep faculty advisors current on University policies and available resources. The Center also collaborates with other areas to enhance the advising support for all students, such as providing support for the peer advising program in the School of Business.24 TRANSFORMA TIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES The Drahmann Learning Resources Center offers drop-in and group tutoring as well as consultation and workshops on learning strategies, study skills, and time management. The Center also provides advising outreach for first-year and undeclared students and collabo - rates with the LEAD Scholars Program to ensure that first-generation college students are fully informed about the range of support services available to all students. Pre-Health Sciences Advising (Advisor: Steven L. Fedder) Santa Clara University has an excellent reputation for preparing students for careers in the health sciences. Most incoming students tend to be focused on either allopathic medi - cine or dentistry, but a much broader spectrum of careers can be equally or more attractive including osteopathic medicine, physical therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, public health professional, and others. A Santa Clara education provides ample opportunity to acquire the academic foundations in natural science required by med - ical schools, and its broad liberal arts Core Curriculum also serves to develop the commu - nication, personal interaction, and analytical skills needed both during medical school and in one's subsequent medical practice. Although Santa Clara does not have a pre-med major, the courses prescribed by the Council of Education of the American Medical Association can be incorporated into several academic majors. In addition, many students become more skilled and competitive by enrolling in two or three upper-division science courses, often but not exclusively in bio - chemistry, genetics, and human physiology, which are helpful in preparing for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The combination of Core Curriculum requirements with the University's focus on community involvement and issues of diversity will prepare stu - dents well for the newly revised MCAT 2015, with its greater emphasis on social, economic, and psychological determinants of health. Students should visit the Pre-Health Advising website at www.scu.edu/cas/prehealth and maintain regular contact with the pre-health sci - ences advisor throughout their undergraduate years for assistance with adjusting to college academic rigor and social life; developing an appreciation of the wide array of available health care careers; achieving balance between academics, social life, work, health commu - nity volunteering, and internships; selecting relevant entrance examinations; and applying to graduate health-science programs. Pre-Law Advising (Advisors: Brian Buckley, Lawrence Nelson, T erri Peretti, Diana Morlang, Melissa Donegan) Santa Clara University provides a wide range of opportunities for undergraduates to build a strong pre-law foundation. Early in their undergraduate program, pre-law students should consult not only with their major advisor but also with one of the designated pre-law advisors. Consultation with a pre-law advisor familiarizes the student with the rigors of law school, the practice of law, the burden of law school debt, and the means to best secure employment as an attorney. Advisors will help formulate a program to prepare students for the complexity of the application process, including preparation for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). There is no specific major or curriculum required to qualify for law school admission. Successful law school applicants come from a diversity of majors such as anthropology, philosophy, communication, political science, physics, English, history, biol - ogy, and economics. However, to successfully prepare for the LSAT, students are advised to select courses that deepen reading comprehension and promote logical reasoning. Law school admissions officers generally recommend undergraduate preparation by selecting a major that demands discipline, analytical ability, research skills, close reading of texts, creativity, verbal skills, and precision in written and oral work. The departments of TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES 25 Philosophy and Political Science offer a pre-law emphasis within the major (in philosophy, it is also available within the minor). Elective courses also provide valuable training and breadth of academic and analytical experience. Some elective courses strengthen specific abilities, while others provide perspective on legal issues and topics. For recommended electives, see www.scu.edu/prelaw/. Pre-Teaching Advising (Advisor: Carol Ann Gittens) Santa Clara University is accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Creden - tialing to offer professional preparation for prospective elementary school, middle school, and senior high school teachers. The Department of Education in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology offers graduate programs for the multiple-subject credential for elementary grades and the single-subject credential for secondary grades, both with a cross- cultural language and academic development emphasis. The teaching credential program at SCU is combined with a Masters of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree. Students interested in teaching should consider completing an interdisciplinary minor in urban education offered through the College of Arts and Sciences. The Future Teachers Project (FTP), formerly known as the Eastside Future Teachers Project, works with students from traditionally underrepresented groups throughout Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area, who are interested in becoming teachers. Through innova - tive outreach and support programs, the goal is to develop leaders who will make an imme - diate impact on their communities. FTP scholars are generally recruited during high school and once at SCU, are considered for the FTP scholarship, which contributes to under - graduate studies and the credential/MAT program. The FTP is managed through the Liberal Studies Program. For more information, see Chapter 3, Liberal Studies Program. THE WRITING CENTER The HUB Writing Center (www.scu.edu/hub/) offers drop-in writing support to graduate and undergraduate students as well as workshops in public speaking, revising and editing, developing personal statements and cover letters, grammar basics, Pathway essay writing, and workshops for students for whom English is not their native language. The writing center also offers students the opportunity to become HUB writing partners and to partici - pate in Independent Studies or research projects. INFORMATION RESOURCES Information Technology Undergraduate students are supported with a variety of computing services at Santa Clara University. Students will receive an SCU Network ID that provides access to multiple accounts. Students also have access to a ubiquitous high speed campus, wired and wireless network, as well as connection to the Internet via the University's 10 GB connection. Students may use the network to access their Gmail and Google Apps account, Camino learning support system, SmartPrint, SCU ePortfolio, Zoom webconferencing, endpoint protection/anti-virus software, and for wireless access. SCU email is used by the University as one of the communication channels to send official notifications to undergraduate stu - dents, and is also used as a frequent communication tool between and among faculty and students. Students are therefore urged to use their SCU email address as their primary 26 TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES email. Students who opt to utilize other email services are advised to check their SCU email periodically to avoid missing important communications. Students have access to administrative information and services at all times through the eCampus portal (ecampus.scu.edu). eCampus services include the ability to view class schedule and course history; run degree progress reports; request enrollment verification; enroll for classes (add, drop, swap); view exam schedules, grades, and unofficial transcripts; request official transcripts; review financial accounts; and maintain personal information such as addresses, phone numbers, alternate email addresses, and emergency contacts; and enroll in Campus Alert, the University's emergency notification system. Students who register for Campus Alert should keep their emergency contact information current in eCampus to ensure notifications are appropriately received. The University provides over 150 PC and Mac workstations in the Learning Commons with a variety of software packages to support both general computing needs and multime - dia production. Technology help and assistance is available at the Information Technology help desks in the Learning Commons approximately 18 hours per day, most days. Free guest wireless access is also available for students visiting friends and family. Information Security Office The Information Security Office protects the University's information assets and ensures that students have access to all of the information resources they need. To protect their private information, students are advised to change their eCampus and SCU Network ID passwords once each quarter; designate a PIN on phone and other mobile devices; install anti-virus software and keep it updated; and set up their computer operating system to install automatic updates. Media Services Media Services offers a broad range of audio, digital video, Web, graphics, and multi- media resources and services. All students have access to equipment and services for class use, class-related projects, and co-curricular use. Media Services supports technology in classrooms, conference rooms, and campus events spaces; the Camino Learning Manage - ment System, Zoom webconferencing, and Digication ePortfolio applications; multimedia and digital video production; and SCU's private cable TV system serving the residence halls. University Library Library resources, which can be accessed within the library and remotely, include an online catalog (OSCAR), more than 200 general and subject-specific databases, research guides for many subjects and some specific classes, \"Ask a Librarian\" 24/7 reference services, and LINK+ interlibrary loan program. The library's collections have grown to more than 927,763 volumes, including approxi - mately 15,877 e-books, and subscriptions to more than 133,237 magazines, journals, and newspapers; over 1,500 are in electronic format. Because the library is a depository for United States and California government documents, more than 600,000 government documents are available online, in print, or in other physical formats. Additionally, the library houses more than 900,000 microforms, hundreds of historical photographs, more than 5,000 maps, and over 20,000 audio/visual items.TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES 27 INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AND SCHOLARS The International Students and Scholars Program provides assistance to undergraduate and graduate international students with support related to visas, intercultural and aca - demic adjustment, and general support for their transition to, and continued success in, their studies on campus and in post-graduation employment. DISABILITIES RESOURCES The Disabilities Resources Office has been designated by the University to ensure access for all undergraduate and graduate students with disabilities to all academic programs and campus resources. The goal is to support students with medical, physical, psychological, attention deficit, and learning disabilities to participate fully in campus life, its programs, and activities. Emphasis is on growth and individual achievement through the provision of academic accommodations, support services, self-advocacy skill training, and disability- related educational programming for the campus community. Reasonable accommodations are provided to minimize the effects of a student's disability and to maximize the potential for success. A student may voluntarily register with the Disability Resources Office by completing the online registration form and providing documentation of his or her disability, after which proper accommodations will be determined and implemented by the University. THE COWELL CENTER The Cowell Center promotes a holistic approach to students' physical, emotional, psychological, and/or interpersonal well-being. The Center's counseling and medical staff are available when students believe that their well-being is being compromised in any way. Through Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), Student Health Services (SHS), Santa Clara University Emergency Medical Services (SCU EMS), and Student Health Insurance, the Cowell Center has a wealth of health and wellness resources to support students as they navigate the academic rigors at Santa Clara University. Counseling and Psychological Services Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) is staffed with psychologists who strive to promote, enhance, and support students' emotional and interpersonal well-being through a range of mental health services offered within a safe and confidential environment. Individual counseling, couples counseling, group counseling, and psycho-educational programs are available. In counseling, students work on a wide range of psychosocial and developmental issues such as depression, anxiety, interpersonal problems, disturbed sleep, eating behaviors, acculturation, academic motivation, homesickness, family concerns, inti - macy, and sexuality. All students are eligible for up to 10 counseling sessions per academic year, the first six (6) sessions are free, with a nominal fee assessed for sessions seven (7) through ten (10). When CAPS is closed, an after-hours emergency and suicide crisis hotline (408-279-3312) is available to students along with Santa Clara's unique crisis webpage featured on Ulifeline at www.ulifeline.org/scu/.28 TRANSFORMATIVE EXPERIENCES AND LEARNING RESOURCES Student Health Services Student Health Services (SHS) is staffed with a physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, and medical assistants.

Student Health Insurance All students are requested to complete a pre-entrance health history prior to arrival at the University and are required to maintain health insurance coverage while enrolled at the University. Students will be charged for University health insurance unless they complete an online waiver verifying their own comparable insurance each academic year. KIDS ON CAMPUS Kids on Campus, the University childcare and preschool program for children between 6 weeks and 5 years of age, is available for faculty, staff, students, and alumni. The staff at Kids on Campus provide a loving, creative, and safe learning environment designed to enhance the physical, mental, and social growth of each child through a \"learning through play\" philosophy.293 College of Arts and Sciences Dean: Debbie Tahmassebi Associate Deans: Barbara M. Fraser, Stephen C. Lee Senior Assistant Dean: Kathleen Villarruel Schneider Assistant Dean: Rafael D. Ulate The goals of the College of Arts and Sciences are to foster a learning community committed to addressing the fundamental problems of society with a spirit of inquiry, mutual respect, and intellectual excitement and to prepare students to understand and appreciate a broad range of peoples and cultures so they may exercise moral leadership in a pluralistic world. In this way, the College is central to Santa Clara's Jesuit, liberal education. With more than 1,500 courses in the humanities, arts, social sciences, and natural sciences, the College offers an inclusive and welcoming academic environment providing: A common educational experience for all undergraduate students through the University's Core Curriculum Majors in 36 subject areas Departmental and interdisciplinary minor programs Opportunities for advanced study in a student's particular area of interest All undergraduate students at the University explore the sciences and liberal arts through the University's Core Curriculum that challenges them to develop open and critical think - ing, to communicate effectively, to work with complex methods of inquiry, to understand diverse cultures and peoples, and to appreciate the demands of ethical decision making. Those who select majors or minors in the College have the opportunity to develop special - ized knowledge and skills in areas of concentration that reflect their personal interests and talents. Students are encouraged to use elective courses to pursue particular interests beyond their chosen major. In addition to selecting individual courses, students have the opportu - nity to organize their electives around minors and emphases in many departmental and interdisciplinary programs throughout the College. The College of Arts and Sciences offers a variety of student-faculty research opportuni - ties and ongoing mentoring relationships in which students work closely with faculty mem - bers in the creation of knowledge or original artistic works.

Westermark Professors: Mary Elaine Hegland, Jegathesan, Lee Panich The Department of Anthropology offers a degree program leading to the bachelor of science in anthropology. A solid undergraduate foundation in anthropology secures the analytical skills needed to undertake professional degrees in anthropology, business, law, public health, social services, or provides a foundation for embarking on a number of other professional careers. The department also offers a minor, several emphases, and an honors thesis option. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling the Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of science degree, students majoring in anthropology must complete the following departmental requirements: ANTH 1, 2, 3 SOCI 1 ANTH 50 or ENVS 50 or POLI 50 ANTH 110, 112, 114, 198 Five upper-division courses selected from the following four categories: biological (ANTH regional (ANTH 180-189). At least three of the four categories must be represented in the student's selection. An introductory statistics course Six anthropology seminars Emphasis Programs in Anthropology Anthropology majors have the option of completing a special emphasis program to complement their majors. The emphasis is not a narrow specialization but reflects compe - tence in the subfields of the discipline. Completion of a special emphasis program will be noted on student transcripts with the approval of the department chair. The emphasis in applied anthropology prepares students to use anthropological knowl - edge to address critical human issues in careers outside academia. Through coursework and related internships, students will gain a better understanding of how anthropological knowl - edge and skills can be used in occupations related to health and medicine, international development, environment, government, business, education, immigration, and poverty. The emphasis in archaeology focuses on a deeper understanding of the human past and how it is studied. This is a possible course of study for majors with an interest in employ - ment in cultural resource management or graduate study in archaeology. The biological emphasis provides in-depth training in the field of biological anthropology. Students will acquire intellectual breadth and depth with regard to the interdisciplinary nature of anthro - pology and the biological and cultural interactions that have influenced human evolution and modern human diversity.32 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in anthropology: ANTH 1 or 2 ANTH 3 One additional lower-division anthropology course ANTH 110 T wo approved upper-division anthropology courses Four anthropology seminars LOWER-DIVISION COURSES 1.

Kelly Detweiler, Kathleen Maxwell Associate Professors: Katherine Aoki ( Department Chair ), Blake de Maria, Don Fritz, Katherine L. Morris, Andrea Pappas Assistant Professors: Karen Fraser, Takeshi Moro, Ryan Reynolds, Senior Lecturer: Francisco \"Pancho\" Jim\u00e9nez Lecturers: Renee Billingslea, Julie Hughes The Department of Art and Art History offers a degree program leading to the bachelor of arts in two undergraduate majors, art history and studio art, with courses in both disciplines fostering a thorough understanding of the history and practice of art. Department faculty encourage interdisciplinary connections with the Santa Clara com - munity through course offerings that fulfill a wide range of College and Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements, as well as courses through the University Honors Program. ART HISTORY The art history major at Santa Clara is distinguished by excellent teaching and mentor - ing, challenging coursework, and opportunities for study abroad, peer educating, and stu - dent internships at local and Bay Area institutions. Moreover, we support, in conjunction with our fully accredited campus museum, Explore with Me, a docent-training program for our students. Advanced art history majors are encouraged to participate in our annual Art History Symposium and the Art History Research Paper Competition. The art history major features numerous opportunities for personal and professional growth to better understand the meanings and purposes of the visual arts, including its historic develop - ment, roles in society, and relationships to other fields in the humanities. Students learn to think critically and communicate clearly about works of art. The art history major develops the following skills: knowledge acquisition, critical thinking, analysis of visual and textual sources, advanced research and writing skills, and sophisticated oral presentations. These intellectual skills enable art history majors to pursue a diversity of interests in a wide spec - trum of fields and professions, including graduate work in art history. STUDIO ART Studio art majors develop comprehensive skills that help prepare them for graduate study or careers in either the fine or commercial arts. Faculty members emphasize the devel - opment of conceptual and technical competence, as well as critical analysis of the student's own work and that of others. By graduation, every student develops a body of original art - work to be exhibited in a senior show in the department gallery. Students are required to articulate an artist's statement reflecting their own engagement with the creative process, in conjunction with their senior show. Studio art majors take three art history courses and are encouraged to take one or more courses in 20th-century or contemporary art. The studio seminar is required for all studio art majors and should be taken in the third year when possible. At the end of each year, students are encouraged to submit their work to the Annual Student Art Exhibit, which is judged by an outside professional in the field of art. The department also oversees merit-based scholarships, which are usually given to outstanding students with junior status.40 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS In addition to fulfilling the Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bach - elor of arts degree, students majoring in art history (ARTH) or studio art (ARTS) must complete the following departmental requirements: Major in Art History Students must complete 15 courses (13 ARTH and 2 ARTS): Four courses from ARTH 11A, 12A, 21-27 T wo lower- or upper-division ARTS courses ARTH 100 (preferably at the end of sophomore year) Five upper-division ARTH courses T wo additional lower- or upper-division ARTH courses ARTH 196 (senior year) Note: Only 4 units of ARTH 93/193, 98/198 may count toward the major.

Keeping up with the Medici: Fame and Family in Renaissance Florence What makes someone a \"household name\"? Is it talent, beauty, connections, or simply shrewd marketing? While fame, fortune, and celebrity may seem like modern phe - nomena, the cult of personality was equally prominent in Renaissance Florence. As is the case today, money played a key role in the arts. This course focuses on the ways in which the Medici family, through their so - cial, financial, and spiritual support, trans - formed the city of Florence from an Italian commune with limited natural resources into the center of the European culture. And in doing so, transformed the notion of the artist from that of mere craftsman to super - star. Additional topics of discussion include the influence of the capitalist economics on artistic production, domestic art perceptions of the nude figure in religious paintings, the relationship between art and science, and the writings of Machiavelli.

Special attention will be focused on the con - struction of St. Peter's Basilica, the decora - tion of the Sistine Chapel and Vatican apartments, cardinalate palaces, suburban villa decoration, and the artistic reaction to the Protestant Reformation. (5 units) 123. The Global Renaissance The Renaissance has traditionally been viewed as a period of artistic and cultural de - velopment associated almost exclusively with the Italian peninsula in the 15th and 16th century. This same tradition privileges \"high art\" - that is, painting, sculpture, and architecture - over other forms of visual cul - ture. This course seeks to reassess these no - tions by considering Italian Renaissance art within the context of early modern global - ism. This reexamination likewise mandates a consideration of a broader spectrum of objects, including gemstones, glassware, and textiles. Topics such as the relationship ART AND ART HISTORY 45 between Michelangelo, Leonardo, and the Ottoman architect Sinan; the collection of Aztec feather paintings by the Medici family; and the influence of Egyptian mosque archi - tecture on Venetian palace design will be ex - amined from an interdisciplinary perspective.

Brunauer, Amelia Fuller, Brian J. McNelis, Amy M. Shachter, Steven W. Suljak Assistant Professors: Paul E. Abbyad, Grace Stokes ( Clare Boothe Luce Professor ), Korin Wheeler Senior Lecturer: Steven L. Fedder Lecturer: Stephen Reaney The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry offers three baccalaureate degrees: the bachelor of science in chemistry, the bachelor of science in biochemistry, and the bachelor of arts in chemistry. The curriculum is accredited by the American Chemical Society (ACS), the professional organization for chemistry. The program prepares students for further work in chemistry or biochemistry, either in graduate school or as professional chemists. In addi - tion, a chemistry or biochemistry degree is excellent preparation for careers in medicine, dentistry, law, engineering, business, and teaching. A minor in chemistry is also available. All bachelor of science degrees provide graduates with the background necessary to begin a career in chemistry or biochemistry at industrial and governmental laboratories, for admission to institutions offering graduate degrees in chemistry and biochemistry, and for admission to medical and dental schools as well as other professional programs in the health professions. The chemistry major provides equal training in all the disciplines in chemistry, and the biochemistry major combines training in chemistry with additional coursework in cell and molecular biology. The bachelor of science-ACS certified degrees meet all recom - mended standards for chemists and biochemists as mandated by the ACS. The bachelor of arts degree allows students the most freedom in choosing electives, and therefore is an excellent program for pre-medical or pre-teaching students. Students with a strong interest in the liberal arts or who wish to pursue subjects outside the standard science curriculum will benefit from this degree. The bachelor of arts degree can be effectively com - bined with a pre-law or business curriculum to provide excellent preparation for law or business careers in the technology sector. Undergraduate research is a critical component of our degrees and most of our majors conduct research in collaboration with faculty mentors. Research in the department has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund, the Dreyfus Foundation, and the Research Corporation. Majors in chemistry, bio - chemistry, biology, and public health science participate in faculty research projects through CHEM 182, 183, and 184. In addition, advanced students have opportunities for part- time employment assisting faculty in laboratory and related teaching activities. The chemistry and biochemistry curricula are designed to be flexible in the sequence of upper-division coursework so as to allow students to participate in study abroad programs. Students interested in study abroad should meet with a faculty advisor to plan the junior and senior year courses as early as possible in their academic careers.66 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of science or bachelor of arts degrees, students majoring in chemistry and biochemistry must complete the following departmental requirements for each degree option: Bachelor of Science in Chemistry CHEM 11, 12, 13, 15, 31, 32, 33 CHEM 102, 111, 141, 151, 152, 154 Three upper-division chemistry electives, not including CHEM 182 Four quarters of CHEM 115 MATH 11, 12, 13 PHYS 11, 12, 13 or PHYS 31, 32, 33 Bachelor of Science in Chemistry\u2014ACS Certified CHEM 11, 12, 13, 15, 31, 32, 33 CHEM 102, 111, 141, 150, 151, 152, 154 CHEM 183, 184 T wo upper-division chemistry electives, not including CHEM 182 Four quarters of CHEM 115 MATH 11, 12, 13 PHYS 31, 32, 33 Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry CHEM 11, 12, 13, 15, 31, 32, 33 CHEM 101, 111, 141, 142, 143, 150, 151 or 152 T wo additional upper-division chemistry electives, not including CHEM 182; BIOL 110, 113, 174, or 176 may be taken to satisfy one of these two electives Four quarters of CHEM 115 MATH 11, 12, 13 PHYS 11, 12, 13 or PHYS 31, 32, 33 BIOL 21, 24, 25, 175 Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry\u2014ACS Certified CHEM 11, 12, 13, 15, 31, 32, 33 CHEM 101, 111, 141, 142, 143, 150, 151 or 152, 154 CHEM 183, 184 T wo additional upper-division chemistry electives; BIOL 110, 113, 174, or 176 may be taken to satisfy one of these two electives Four quarters of CHEM 115 MATH 11, 12, 13 PHYS 31, 32, 33 BIOL 21, 24, 25, 175CHEMISTRY AND BIOCHEMISTRY 67 Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry CHEM 11, 12, 13, 15, 31, 32, 33 CHEM 101 or 102, 111, 141, and 150 or 151 or 152 T wo additional upper-division chemistry electives, not including CHEM 182 Upper-division lab requirement: 30 hours, which can be satisfied by CHEM 102, 143, 154, or 1 unit of CHEM 182 Four quarters of CHEM 115 MATH 11, 12, 13 PHYS 11, 12, 13 or PHYS 31, 32, 33 Electives for all degrees can be fulfilled by taking any upper-division chemistry or biochemistry class of 3 units or more, including CHEM 183 and 184.

Moritz Professors: William S. Greenwalt, John ( Department Associate Professors: LaBarge, Professor Assistant Professors: Carolynn E. Roncaglia, Daniel W. T urkeltaub Classics in the broad sense is the study of all aspects of the life and culture of ancient Greece and Rome in their Mediterranean context. The Department of Classics offers all levels of ancient Greek and Latin as well as courses that explore the origins of Western literature , history, art, mythology, philosophy, religion, and government and their enduring relevance to our lives. Most courses in the department require no knowledge of an ancient language and are open to any interested student. Latin or Greek may be taken to satisfy the second language requirement. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the field, classics provides an ideal liberal arts curriculum that is an excellent background for careers in many areas. Majors and minors are available in several programs in the Department of Classics: classical languages and literatures (Latin or Greek; there is a major, but no minor, in Latin and Greek), classical studies, and ancient studies.

Soukup, Pedro Michael Whalen ( Knight Ridder/ San Jose Professors: Christine M. Bachen, Hsin-I Justin Sreela Sarkar Senior Lecturers: Kelley, Gordon Young Lecturers: Katharine Heintz, Andrew W. Ishak The Department of Communication offers a program of studies leading to a bachelor of arts in communication. The major prepares students for a wide variety of graduate studies and for careers in the communication industry. An academic minor is also available. Students explore the theories, research methods, responsibilities, institutional structures, and effects of mass communication, interpersonal communication, and computer-mediated commu - nication. The major also integrates theory with practice. We help students to apply their knowledge of the communication process to create their own speeches, films, television programs, journalism, Web content, and communication and marketing campaigns. Many of our students go directly to work in these fields after graduation. Because the communication field requires students to have a broad liberal arts education, students integrate courses in the Department of Communication with courses in other departments. Often, students complete a minor or take a number of courses in related dis - ciplines. To encourage students to explore global studies, the department accepts up to two approved study abroad courses toward completion of the communication course require - ments, usually as upper-division electives. All junior and senior students are encouraged to complete an internship at an off-campus media organization or other communication- related institution. Internships may be counted for course credit as a department elective. In their senior years, all communication majors synthesize their learning in the depart - ment by completing a scholarly thesis (on any aspect of communication) or an applied capstone project (in journalism, digital filmmaking, or public relations). Theses and capstone projects, which typically embody students' most advanced work, are suitable for submission as part of applications for graduate school and jobs. Students interested in communication, including nonmajors, enjoy a wealth of co- curricular opportunities. All students are encouraged to participate in one of the student- run campus media, including the student newspaper, radio station, and yearbook. Practicum courses allow students to gain academic credit for working in student media. Santa Clara Debate, one of the oldest forensic programs in continuous operation on the West Coast, provides a challenging and rigorous co-curricular activity designed to develop public speak - ing skills, critical thinking, and public policy analysis. Policy debate participants are eligible to apply for merit scholarships. All courses taken to fulfill requirements for the major or minor must be four or five units and must be taken for a letter grade, not on a pass/no pass basis. Practicum courses, numbered 190 through 195, do not count toward fulfillment of the communication major or minor.COMMUNICATION 81 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree, students majoring in communication must complete the following depart - mental requirements: COMM 1 COMM 2 or 2GL 30 COMM 40 or 40EL T wo upper-division communication theory courses (signified by the letter \"A\" in the course number) One upper-division communication applied course (signified by the letter \"B\" in the course number) T wo additional approved elective upper-division communication courses COMM 110 COMM 111 or 111G COMM 196 or 197 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in communication: COMM 1 or 2 T wo approved upper-division communication courses Three additional approved communication courses (any combination of upper-division or lower-division courses) LOWER-DIVISION COURSES 1.

Keck Foundation Professor ), Alexander J. Field (Michel and Mary Orradre Professor ), John M. Heineke, Kris J. Mitchener (Robert Susan Sundstrom Lecturer: Adina Ardelean As one of the social sciences, economics studies how the choices we make as individu - als\u2014as consumers and producers, as savers and investors, as managers and employees, as citizens and voters\u2014combine to determine how society uses its scarce resources to produce and distribute goods and services. This practical discipline provides insights into important issues such as the determinants of wealth and poverty; unemployment, inflation, interna - tional trade, and economic growth; and success and failure in the marketplace. The rigor - ous, systematic analysis that the study of economics brings to bear on these and other real-world issues provides excellent preparation for careers in both the private and the public sectors, as well as for graduate study in economics, business, public policy, and law. Economics graduates pursue varied careers in business, law, banking and finance, govern - ment service, education, and private consulting. Students considering graduate study in economics leading to a master's or doctoral degree are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor as early as possible to plan an appropriate course of study.

Hazard Jr. The Ethnic Studies Program provides a critical analysis of historical and contemporary formations of race, ethnicity, class, and gender. In the pursuit of social justice, it challenges dominant views of racial and ethnic groups that lead to inequalities. Ethnic studies focuses on the roles and experiences of African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islander Americans, Latinas/Latinos, and Native Americans within the framework of the United States and within transnational frameworks. As an academic program, ethnic studies fosters interdisciplinary inquiry. The faculty comprise a community of expert scholars of critical race and ethnic studies, while serving as teachers, mentors, and role models for undergraduate students. Ethnic studies strives to make connections between University learning, racial and ethnic communities, and social change, and encourages a reflective engagement with society and a commitment to fashion - ing a more humane and just world. The Ethnic Studies Program serves as a resource for students, faculty, and staff across the University who are interested in examining race and ethnicity and its intersections with class, gender, citizenship, and nationality. The program offers both a companion major and a minor in ethnic studies: a student must declare a primary major in another discipline as well as companion major in ethnic studies. The companion major is designed to complement a student's primary major by broadening the field of study to include an academic focus on race/ethnicity.

(4 units) 55. Cross-Racial Electoral Politics Examination of the historical and contem - porary political movements among the major minority groups in the United States since the 1960s. The origins and goals of the Black Power movement, the Chicano/a movement, the Asian-American movement, and the Native American movement will be focused on during the quarter. Each of these movements embodies similar and different trails with regard to their respective group's quest for political power and elected repre - sentation. Due to contemporary immigra - tion trends, Latinos and Asian Americans have challenged the black-white paradigm that has traditionally defined U.S. racial politics in local and state-level politics. The result, in some instances, has been interracial competition and conflict at these levels. The necessary elements needed to build and to sustain multiracial coalitions along with what the political future holds for these mi - nority groups will be addressed. Also listed as POLI 55 .

African-American Independent Filmmakers This class provides an in-depth analysis and historical overview of independent African- American filmmakers who made significant contributions to the genre of film. We will examine how African-American filmmakers used film as a medium to heighten the con - sciousness of their audience, combat nega - tive stereotypes, give voice to marginalized or underrepresented groups, and raise social awareness about issues affecting their diverse communities. Using film and text, we will read, discuss, and write about paradigms that lead to inequity and injustice. Specifi - cally, we will examine the intersection of gender, race, and class, and note how these dynamics are illustrated in the cinema of African Americans. We will also understand how African-American filmmakers were able to rise above adversity and hone and sustain their art, while confronting their myriad oppressions. (4 units)ETHNIC STUDIES 131 96. Race, Class, and Culture through Film Explores how filmmakers who are concerned about racism portray the politics, history, and culture of people of African descent. Examines how this medium can humanize subjects who are often objectified and exploited and give voice to communities whose perspectives and opinions have been historically excluded from mainstream dis - courses. Considers how films can interrogate the physical, cultural, and sometimes, psychological brutality of racist practices, as well as the ways that racism intersects with other forms of marginalization related to class, gender, sexuality, and citizenship. The content, production, and distribution of these cinematic portraits illuminate the po - litical philosophies, hybrid cultures, and emancipating collective action of black com - munities. Integrates students in faculty research by involving students in a docu - mentary film project about the relationship between the social movements for African liberation and black power. (4 units) UPPER-DIVISION COURSES 112.

Latina/o Immigrant Detention and Incorporation in the Age of Terrorism This class will examine shifts in immigration politics with specific focus on the largest population of immigrants in the U.S., namely Latinas/os. In the course of this ex - amination, we will pay particular attention to changes occurring after 1996 and the in - creasing scrutiny of both documented and undocumented immigrants that has led to surges in the numbers of immigrants de - tained, apprehended, incarcerated, and de - ported. We will be mindful of the gendered, class, and racialized dynamics at work in the development and execution of new immi - gration policy, and we will examine the ef - fect of these shifts on concepts of citizenship. In the end, the course will compel students to consider the moral, political, and legal im - plications of an immigration policy focused disproportionately on enforcement and challenge them to find comprehensive alter - natives. (5 units) 129. Mexican Popular Catholicism and Gender From the perspective of the sociology of reli - gion, this course contextualizes the lives of Chicanas/Mexicanas in Mexican popular Catholic tradition, practices, and belief sys - tem with particular attention to race, class, gender, and sexuality. This course reposi - tions feminist analysis from a brief acknowl - edgement of the influence of Mexican popular Catholicism in the lives of Chicanas/ Mexicanas to a much more encompassing critical analysis of exactly how Catholicism influences women's everyday experiences. Through the use of case studies and second - ary research, students will explore the cre - ative and complex ways Chicanas/Mexicanas participate in the workforce, in politics, in public life, and at home as people of faith.

African Americans in Postwar Film This course examines the presence of Afri - can Americans in mainstream Hollywood films during the postwar period. How did Hollywood representations of African Americans change after World War II? What shifts and continuities occurred during the postwar period? And how did those changes reflect the ebbs and flows of civil rights activ - ism through the 1970s? The goal of this course is to gain a deeper understanding of broader social and historical change by en - gaging the politics of race through a core as - pect of American popular culture. Also listed as HIST 185. (5 units)ETHNIC STUDIES 133 141. Asian-American Women An examination of Asian-American women from a historical and contemporary frame - work within U.S. society.

(5 units) 149. Civil Rights and Anti-Colonial Movements This course examines the connections be - tween two historical developments often treated separately: the U.S. civil rights strug - gle and African anti-colonial movements. By placing these two movements in a transna - tional framework, the course explores the global challenge to the racialized world order of the 19th and early 20th century. How did the civil rights struggle gain momentum in the aftermath of World War II? What was the longer history and role of \"black nation - alism\" and Pan-Africanism in the transna - tional struggle? What were the connections between the civil rights movement and con - temporary independence movements in Africa and Asia? One of the central goals of the course is to show how we can expand our understanding of U.S. history by reaching beyond the interaction between the U.S. government and other nation-states to ex - amine political and cultural change. Also listed as HIST 153. (5 units)150. Urban Education and Multiculturalism This course takes a critical multicultural ap - proach to understanding urban education, encouraging a connection between theory and personal experience and observations. With a focus on schools in large urban con - texts, this course centralizes the experiences of low-income, students of color. Race and class will be two critical lenses with which we will examine (1) the historical context of educational inequality, (2) current issues of educational inequity, and (3) the movement towards educational justice. Students should leave the course with a stronger understand - ing of the social and historical foundations of U.S. education. (5 units) 152. Multiracial Identities This course focuses on multiracial identity constructs in African-American and Asian- American literature. Using journey as a met - aphor, the course seeks to define \"movement\" and \"place\" in contexts where physical, spiri - tual, voluntary, or forced journeys contrib - ute to the transformative possibilities of race, class, gender, and identity.

Also listed as WGST 114. (5 units) 160. Documentary Making for Social Justice This creative course provides students the opportunity to write, dissect, and produce their own 10-minute documentaries that are committed to social justice. In addition to producing their own films, students will ex - amine how documentary filmmakers use film as a medium to heighten the conscious - ness of their audience, combat negative ste - reotypes, give voice to marginalized or underrepresented groups, and raise social awareness about issues affecting their diverse communities. Reading film as \"text\"\u2014com - plete with their own arguments, aesthetic concerns, social, political, and historical in - fluences\u2014we will understand how docu - mentaries are used to illumine disparities or confront issues of inequity and injustice. Specifically, we will examine the intersection of gender, race, class, spirituality, and sexual - ity, and note how these dynamics function in film to enlighten our global community. Writers in this course will be moved from idea to script and, ultimately, film. (5 units)161. Creating Diverse College-Going Communities In this course, students will develop an un - derstanding of diversity issues in college ac - cess, reflect on their own experiences, utilize this knowledge to develop workshop curric - ulum to enhance college-going, and then implement this curriculum in high school classrooms as a community-based learning opportunity. This course introduces stu - dents to the background of colleges and uni - versities in the United States, (including history, institutional types, and diverse stu - dent representation), then explores the many factors that influence college access and ex - periences in college (including class, race, gender, first generation college student sta - tus, financial aid and admissions processes). Students will reflect on their own college ap - plication and selection process and their ex - periences in college. Using this knowledge, students will engage in community-based learning (CBL) in which they provide col - lege-related tutoring, mentoring, and work - shops for high school students. (5 units) 162. Diversity and the Media This course focuses on the complex, chang - ing, dynamic, and powerful relationships between dominant and underrepresented groups in society, the mass media, and broader social contexts; and discusses media representations of social groups, contexts of media production, and media use among underrepresented groups. The concepts of hegemony, power, social construction, and intersectionality are vital for understanding these relationships, and vital for the course. The course connects to the field of cultural studies in that it focuses on the everyday uses of symbolic forms and aims to make stu - dents aware of, and sensitive to, some of the dynamics connected with media images, symbolic power, and the production of meaning in today's world. Students are en - couraged to formulate, question, and put into context, their own versions of reality. Also listed as COMM 121A . (5 units)ETHNIC STUDIES 135 163. Multiracial Communities in Central California This course will examine the process of ra - cialization in various communities through - out California and uncover how various ethno-racial groups within these communi - ties live, work, and thrive together in their specific locales. This course will begin by in - terrogating definitions of community, spa - tial geography, political economy, as well as attempting to understand social attitudes about race and racism. Then we will exam - ine various cities as case studies to under - stand the different ways multiracial communities formed. The end goal is to un - derstand the nuances of how multiracial communities, both urban and rural, devel - oped and inscribed meaning onto the geog - raphy of California. (5 units) 164.

Race and World War II World War II stands as one of the most ex - plosive moments in U.S. and global history in the 20th century because of the myriad ways the conflict influenced the postwar world. The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of struc - tural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a com - posite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropo - logical and biological sciences just preceding the war. The assigned readings and discus - sions engage these phenomena in order to properly explore the significance of \"race\" in the World War II era. Also listed as HIST 178 . (5 units) 185.

(5 units) 112. The Haitian Revolution in World History and Memory Between 1789 and 1804, the French Carib - bean colony of Saint-Domingue was the site of the most profound and violent realization of the revolutionary spirit sweeping the At - lantic in the \"age of democratic revolutions.\" This era is usually associated with the French and American revolutions, both key events in the history of democracy and the rhetori - cal development of human rights as an agen - da in the West. However, both stopped short of the most radical realization of the prom - ises of the age of Enlightenment, particularly with regard to slavery and the racial discrim - ination that went along with it. The slave revolt on Saint-Domingue and the Haitian revolution, by contrast, witnessed the fullest realization of these promises in the form of the only successful slave revolt in human his - tory. The events on Hispaniola took place at the nexus of world historical forces of global - ization through commerce, cross-cultural encounter, racial mixing, and the dispersal of radical Enlightenment ideas and their real - ization in the form of revolution. As a result of the powerful currents of human history that flowed through the region, the Haitian revolution has proved to be an enduring source of both fear and creativity in the his - tory of race relations, slavery, and abolition, and the forging of a new world identity for the descendants of the once enslaved popu - lations of the island. This course will exam - ine the history of the revolutionary years in Haiti, its near erasure from Western historical memory, and the literary and his - torical recovery of its importance in the 20th and 21st centuries.

(1-5 units)166 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES DEPARTMENT OF MODERN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES Professor Emeritus: Francisco Jim\u00e9nez Professors: Rose Marie The Department of Modern Languages and Literatures offers courses in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, as well as degree programs leading to the bachelor of arts in French and Francophone Studies, German Studies, Italian Studies, or Spanish Studies. Honors programs are available for French and German majors. In addi - tion, the department offers minors in French and Francophone studies, German studies, Italian studies, Japanese studies, and Spanish studies. The courses are designed to help stu - dents achieve proficiency in both the oral and written language and to provide them with an understanding of the experiences, values, and traditions of those peoples whose lan - guages are studied. Courses range from beginning language to linguistics, from an introduc - tion to literary texts to advanced courses in literature and culture. All courses are open to any student with the requisite preparation. A few courses in literature and culture offered by the department are taught in English and are open to all students. Some of these courses may be used as credit toward a major or minor in French and Francophone studies, a major or minor in German studies, or a minor in Japanese studies. However, these courses in English will not fulfill the Undergraduate Core Curriculum foreign language requirement. Students may fulfill their second language Core Curriculum requirement by successfully completing a proficiency examination in a modern foreign language at the level for their program of study. Students who have never studied the language in which they wish to enroll, or who have studied that language for one year in high school, should register for Elementary Language 1. Those who wish to continue in a language that they have studied for two years in high school should enter Elementary Language 2. Students with three or more years of study in a single language, those who wish to continue language study beyond the second language requirement, or those who feel following the formula would place them in a higher- or lower-level course than their background warrants should consult a member of the appro - priate language faculty for placement advice. Students having the necessary proficiency, as demonstrated by an interview with a member of the language faculty, may enroll in higher- numbered courses than those of the placement formula. Once proficiency has been estab - lished, lower-division students may enroll in upper-division courses with the permission of the instructor. Such courses will be counted as fulfilling major or minor requirements. Courses numbered 1 through 102 are not open to challenge; for courses numbered above 102, consult the individual listing. For more information about placement and/or proficiency, please visit the department's website. Study abroad is a valuable enhancement of the undergraduate experience and is particularly recommended for students pursuing a major or minor in a foreign language. Both the Office of International Programs and the student's foreign language advisor should be consulted to ensure appropriate integration of the work done abroad into the student's program of study.MODERN LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES 167 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJORS In addition to fulfilling Undergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in modern languages and literatures must complete the following departmental requirements for their specific major: Major in French and Francophone Studies FREN 100 and 101, or department-approved substitutes At least one course in French or Francophone literature Remaining electives in French or Francophone studies to total 40 quarter upper- division units chosen with the approval of the student's major advisor.

Barber Jr., Betty A. Young ( Department Chair and Lee and Seymour Graff Professor II) Associate Professors: John T. Birmingham, Philip R. Kesten, Guy Ramon, Christopher P . Weber Lecturer: Kristin Kulas The Department of Physics offers major programs of lecture and laboratory instruction leading to the bachelor of science in physics, the bachelor of science in physics with a bio - physics emphasis, and the bachelor of science in engineering physics. The department also provides an academic minor in physics and required and elective courses for students major - ing in other fields. The usual career goal of a physics major is professional scientific employment in industry or government, by a university, or in a secondary school teaching physical science. The undergraduate major program in physics is appropriate preparation for graduate study in physics, astronomy and astrophysics, biophysics, environmental science, geological science and geophysics, medical physics and medicine, patent law, oceanography, and other fields. The physics major with a biophysics emphasis (newly implemented in 2015-2016) pro - vides a solid preparation for graduate studies and for nearly all of the postgraduate opportu - nities open to traditional physics majors. Students who complete the biophysics emphasis will have additional opportunities in medicine, the life sciences, and related industries. The engineering physics major is particularly appropriate for the applied science student who intends to do research and development, and/or attend graduate school in physics, applied physics, or various engineering disciplines. The engineering physics major covers a broad spectrum of courses in mathematics, engineering, and physics. This program empha - sizes, to a greater extent than the traditional engineering major, the physics fundamentals that are applicable to new technologies as well as to the more established ones. Research in the department currently is funded by the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the Department of Energy. Majors in physics and engineering physics partici - pate in faculty research projects through PHYS 198 (Undergraduate Physics Research). Advanced students also have opportunities for part-time employment assisting faculty in laboratory and related teaching activities.

Hanson (Patrick A. Donohoe, S.J. Professor ), Timothy J. Lukes, Peter I. Minowitz, Terri L. Peretti, William J. Stover Associate Professors: Elsa Y. Chen, Gregory P . Corning, James S. Lai, Farid D. Senzai Assistant Professors: Anne E. Baker, Naomi Levy Senior Lecturer: Diana Morlang Lecturer: Kenneth Faulve-Montojo The Department of Political Science offers a degree program leading to the bachelor of science in political science. The department introduces students to the analysis of political behavior, values, institutions, and governments. It also offers preparation for various graduate and professional studies and for careers in public service. The department makes available opportunities to participate in a variety of programs that combine practical field experience and academic credit. It assists students in arranging academic credit for internships in local politics. Students may work for government agen - cies, legislative or judicial bodies, political parties, or politically related groups. The depart - ment regularly offers courses that combine local internships with classroom work. On the national level, Santa Clara is a member school of American University's Washington, D.C., program, in which students receive credit for internships and intensive seminars at the nation's capital. Santa Clara also participates in the Panetta Institute's Congressional Intern - ship Program, which fully subsidizes students who study and intern with the California Congressional delegation on Capitol Hill. On the international level, the department encourages student participation in the numerous University-operated and approved study abroad programs, especially those with internships. See the Domestic Public Sector Studies Programs section in Chapter 2 for additional details on public sector programs.

All majors who are not seniors and who have completed at least two of the lower-division sequence of courses (1, 2 or 3, 25, 30, 40, 99) with a grade point average of 3.0 or better are eligible to apply. A maximum of 15 students from each class are admitted. Admission is determined on the basis of coursework, recommendations, and a personal interview with the faculty director. Honors students are expected to participate in various department-sponsored events, and a representative from the program has full voting status in the deliberations of the department faculty. Participants in the program must complete a senior thesis, fulfill one of three supplemental curriculum requirements (a minor or a second major, ECON 1 and 2, or language 21 and 22), and take a highly active role in department affairs. OPTIONAL EMPHASES Political science majors may select an emphasis in pre-law, public sector studies, or inter - national relations, which will be noted on the student's transcript. Recommended courses for completing the three emphasis options are available on the department's website. Emphasis in Public Sector Studies The public sector emphasis is a specialized area of concentration within the political science major allowing students to focus their coursework toward public sector studies. The emphasis is designed to provide a closer look at the creation, implementation, and analysis of public policies, and the operation of governments and public organizations. The public sector emphasis provides an excellent foundation for those who would like to pursue careers or graduate studies in public policy, public administration, public affairs, urban planning, and law. Requirements for the public sector emphasis include a variety of courses both inside and outside of the political science department. For the most up-to-date infor - mation about the public sector emphasis, see http://www.scu.edu/cas/politicalscience/ academicinformation/.

After all, politi - cal science is the closest of all majors to the institutions and values with which law deals. The primary study of law is the state, and so too for political science. Additionally, the demands of political science courses (reading of complex texts, independent research, frequent class presentations, and demanding writing assignments) strengthen the analytical and commu - nications skills that the practice of law requires. Requirements for the pre-law emphasis include a variety of courses from both inside and outside of the political science department. At most, six courses are required: three within the political science department and three from outside the political science department, although many of these courses fulfill other Core and political science major requirements.

Stephens The Public Health Program in the College of Arts and Sciences offers the bachelor of science degree in public health science. The program also offers a minor degree in public health, and manages the Global Health Pathway of the University Core. The public health science (PHS) major is an interdisciplinary degree focused on the health of human populations and individuals. Students will gain a solid foundation in biol - ogy and chemistry to understand the functioning of the human body in health and disease. The major further explores the influences of environmental and social factors on human health through required and elective public health courses, as well as relevant courses in the social sciences and humanities. Through the senior capstone and mandatory internship, PHS majors engage in health-focused service and research projects that apply their educa - tion to real-world public health problems, and integrate learning across disciplines. Students are encouraged to study abroad to gain perspective on global health issues. Public health science majors will be well-prepared for careers, graduate education, or professional training in public health or health-related professions, including medicine and nursing. There are many career options in the field of public health, including healthcare administration, planning, and public policy; epidemiology and disease surveillance; clinical research and clinical trials management; health-related education and social work; health and science communication; and basic research. Students intending to pursue a medical degree, or postgraduate training in other health- related professions, should contact the University pre-health advisor to discuss prerequisites for admission to such programs. Many require a full year of physics coursework (e.g., PHYS 11-13 or 31-33) and completion of the organic chemistry series (CHEM 33) in addition to the requirements for the public health science major.

Professors: Aldo Billingslea, Barbara Fraser, Barbara Murray Associate Professors: Jerald R. Enos, Kimberly M. Hill, David J. Popalisky (Department Chair ), Michael Zampelli, Lecturers: Karyn Connell, Pauline Locsin-Kanter, Patt Ness The Department of Theatre and Dance celebrates the creativity of the human spirit, offering a well-rounded education that leads to a bachelor of arts degree in theatre arts with emphases in either theatre or dance. The department also offers minors in theatre, dance, and musical theater (an interdisciplinary minor offered in collaboration with the Department of Music). The program emphasizes academic rigor, artistic discipline, and creative expres - sion. All students work closely with faculty and staff mentors. Majors fulfill all requirements set forth by the Undergraduate Core Curriculum, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Department of Theatre and Dance. Theatre and dance are distinct but related areas of emphasis. While each has its own set of disciplinary standards and academic requirements, students in each emphasis share some common courses (e.g., Introduction to Performance Collaboration, Defining the Performing Artist, etc.) The theatre emphasis offers coordinated courses in acting, design, theatre history, dra - matic literature, technical production, directing, and playwriting. Students with this emphasis will have a broad foundation in theatrical practice and may choose to focus their study in any of the aforementioned areas. The dance emphasis focuses on modern dance and choreography and provides additional training in ballet and jazz. Majors, in either emphasis, will complete their program with a senior project that demonstrates their profi - ciency in a chosen area. All students are encouraged to be creative in taking responsibility for their undergradu - ate education, working with advisors and mentors to plan programs that marry courses in their focus areas to other disciplines. Since courses in theatre and dance provide students with invaluable experience in collaboration, critical thinking, organizational management, and effective communication skills, they may profitably combine a major in theatre arts with a major (or minor) in almost any other discipline\u2014especially, English, music, com - munication, art, psychology, political science, history, or business. Students also combine their theatre arts major with various education credential programs. A degree in theatre arts prepares students for a variety of career options. Some students pursue graduate study in specialized focus areas so as to become professional theatre or dance artists and teachers. Others pursue careers in professional theatre or dance companies immediately after graduation. Still others venture into the world of film, television, arts administration, education, and religious ministry. Many have used their performing arts experience to pursue careers in law, medicine, management, and marketing and development. The performance season, sponsored by the department, includes four faculty-directed plays and two dance concerts, in addition to student-directed plays and dance recitals. Participation in these productions is open to all members of the University community\u2014 students, faculty, and staff. Guest artists periodically direct, design, choreograph, and/or perform in productions with SCU students.THEATRE AND DANCE 267 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR In addition to fulfilling undergraduate Core Curriculum and College of Arts and Sciences requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in theatre arts must complete the following departmental requirements: Emphasis in Theatre THTR 9, 10, 24 , and 30 THTR 41A, 42B One course from THTR 31, 32, 33 THTR 185 One course from THTR 112, 113, 116, 117, 118, 161, 167 DANC 159 or 189 Three approved 5-unit upper-division theatre or dance electives 4 units of THTR 39/139 Senior Project may be fulfilled by one of the following courses: THTR 192, 195, 196, 197 (*see description below) Emphasis in Dance THTR 9, 10 and 30 DANC 48 ( prerequisite: DANC 47 or permission of instructor ) DANC 49 One course each in Ballet and Jazz (one at level III) DANC 67 DANC 143 and 146 T wo courses from DANC 140, 141, 142, 145, 147, or 148 DANC 162 or 166 DANC 159 or 189 2 units of THTR 39/139 Senior Project may be fulfilled by one of the following courses: DANC 192 or 193 (*see description below) *Senior Project: The Senior Project provides majors with the opportunity to demon - strate their progress in meeting the learning objectives established by the department.

This program also encourages the study of diaspora and immigrant communities where Islamic and Middle Eastern populations constitute a religious or ethnic minority. Students enrolled in this minor have the opportunity to sample a variety of methodolo - gies and academic disciplines\u2014including anthropology, art history, literary criticism, his - tory, political science, and religious studies\u2014that address the Middle East in particular and the Islamic world at large. The AIMES interdisciplinary minor is ideal for students who want to develop the intel - lectual resources for thoughtful and informed engagement with current issues in the Middle East and the Islamic world. AIMES is also well suited for students considering work with overseas aid organizations, government and military service, international business, or grad - uate programs in international studies. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must complete a total of nine courses\u2014six culture courses and three Arabic language courses\u2014for a minor in AIMES. Details concerning these requirements are as follows: Culture Courses Students must take a total of six culture courses relating to AIMES (two lower-level and four upper-level) from at least three different departments. No more than two courses may be counted for AIMES credit from the department in which a student majors. A maximum of three courses for AIMES credit may be taken from any one department. Arabic Language Three quarters of Arabic are required. Students with prior knowledge of a relevant lan - guage may take a test that certifies that they have fulfilled this requirement. Senior Project In lieu of one of the six required courses in Middle Eastern and Islamic cultures, students may elect to do an independent study/reading course on a project in consultation with a member of the AIMES Faculty Advisory Council. This project may entail fieldwork with local Islamic and diaspora Middle Eastern communities in the Bay area. Students enrolled in the AIMES minor are strongly encouraged to participate in SCU- approved study abroad programs that pertain to Arabic, Islamic, and Middle Eastern stud - ies. Before enrolling in any such program, students should check with the director and faculty members of the AIMES minor as well as the International Programs Office.290 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES ANTHROPOLOGY COURSES ANTH 187.

Directed Reading and Research BIOTECHNOLOGY Director: David Hess Biotechnology is revolutionizing the practice of medicine and agriculture and is having an impact on fields as diverse as human reproduction, forensics, manufacturing, and pollu - tion control. The minor in biotechnology is designed for students interested in gaining insight into the scientific background of biotechnology, exploring its potential for the future, and obtaining practical experience in laboratory techniques used in biotechnology research and its applications. This course of study is most useful for students contemplating careers in the biotechnology industry and students who plan to pursue advanced degrees in related areas such as molecular biology, cell biology, or biochemistry. The minor will be most easily completed by students majoring in biology, public health science, or chemistry and biochemistry; other majors should consult with their advisors and begin the course of study as early as possible in order to complete the requirements in a timely manner. T welve courses are required for the minor, at least seven of which must have laboratory components. In addition to coursework, students are required to complete a research internship at a biotechnology company, a research institute, or an academic laboratory focusing on an area relevant to biotechnology (i.e., cell biology, molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, microbiology, or genomics). Internships must be approved in advance by the director. The minimum length of the internship is 10 weeks of full-time work or 400 hours total time if done on a part-time basis. Students must prepare a written report on the project upon completion to be evaluated by the director.294 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in biotechnology: Scientific Foundations of Biotechnology BIOL 21, 24, 25, 175 CHEM 11, 12, 31, 32 Ethical Issues BIOL 171 Advanced Laboratory Skills BIOL 176, 177, or CHEM 143 Contemporary Topics in Biotechnology and Related Fields BIOL 189 One Elective Course BIOL 110, 113, 174, or CHEM 141 CATHOLIC STUDIES Director: Michael C. McCarthy, S.J. The minor in Catholic studies, open to students from all departments, is an interdisci - plinary program for the study of the intellectual tradition of the Catholic faith. The minor is designed for intensive study of Catholicism as a faith embedded in many cultures and for the critical retrieval of the Catholic intellectual tradition through dialogue with contempo - rary thought under the rubrics of a variety of academic disciplines. Catholic studies minors are assigned a faculty mentor who guides them through the program. In conjunction with the Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education, the Catholic Studies program sponsors intellec - tual, cultural, social, and religious opportunities for both students and faculty. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in Catholic studies: Foundational Courses T wo courses in Catholic theology from offerings in the Department of Religious Studies One approved course from the Cultures & Ideas series (or equivalent)INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 295 Faith and Culture Courses One specialized course in Catholic history One course in Catholic literature One specialized course in philosophy or an upper-division course in theology T wo approved elective courses in the study of Catholic societies or cultures The Colloquium During sophomore, junior, and senior years, students may participate in a 2-unit inter - disciplinary colloquium. The colloquium meets one quarter each year for discussion of a range of relevant topics pertinent to the Catholic intellectual tradition. The colloquium is open to all Santa Clara students, but first priority is given to Catholic studies minors. INTERNATIONAL STUDIES Director: Susan M. Popko Students who pursue the international studies minor may examine global themes, trends in globalization or intercultural communication, or use the minor to add a global dimen - sion or context to their major. The minor offers students the opportunity to pursue one of two emphases: (1) the Global Thematic emphasis in which students concentrate their coursework on themes related to international or cross-cultural studies, or (2) the Area Studies emphasis in which students concentrate their coursework on selected geographic areas (Africa, Europe, or Latin America). The Global Thematic emphasis offers students the opportunity to examine broad inter - national issues that transcend a single nation or geographic area. In the Global Thematic emphasis, the student has the opportunity to focus on a topic such as poverty and develop - ment, global health, international law, international human rights, peace and conflict reso - lution, cross-cultural communication, international social justice in the arts, technology and globalization, the global dimensions of natural and physical sciences, diplomacy, gender and society, etc. Such subjects require systematic approaches distinct from the examination of single-nation or area studies. Some of the most compelling Global Thematic emphasis topics in recent years have included international law, global issues of sustainability, interna - tional women's rights, and community arts in the global context. The Area Studies emphasis may include a focus on Africa, Europe, or Latin America. The Area Studies emphasis offers an interdisciplinary introduction to the cultures, lan - guages, politics, and global challenges facing the region. The Area Studies emphasis with a focus on Africa also includes study of the African diaspora and related issues of slavery, colonialism, and globalization.296 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR For the minor in international studies, students must complete the equivalent of four foundation courses, a capstone course, plus an emphasis courses in either global thematic or area studies as follows: Foundation Courses Foreign Language: T wo upper-division courses in a foreign language related to the chosen Global Thematic or Area Studies emphasis or the equivalent, as demonstrated through successful examination through the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures Social Science: T wo relevant courses in anthropology, communication, political science, or sociology; one of which must be ANTH 3, COMM 107A, 2, POLI 25, SOCI 133, or SOCI 134 Capstone Course A minimum of 20 contact hours in a class, academic internship, or community-based learning experience abroad. The course must include academic oversight and assessment. This requirement may be fulfilled by a minimum of one quarter study abroad related to the chosen Area Studies or Global Thematic emphasis. Students should communicate with the associate provost for International Programs to request approval for alternative capstone courses. Global Thematic Emphasis Courses In addition to the foundation courses, students pursuing the Global Thematic emphasis must complete three courses, at least two of which must be upper division and no more than one of which may be in the student's academic major. Students develop their own theme and present a detailed proposal to the International Studies Committee for approval usually no later than the first quarter of their junior year. Students planning to incorporate academic work from a study abroad program should obtain approval prior to departure. Area Studies Emphasis Courses In addition to the foundation courses, students pursuing the Area Studies emphasis must complete three courses, at least two of which must be upper division and no more than one of which may be in the student's academic major. Other courses may be approved with the permission of the associate provost for International Programs.

MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE STUDIES Director: Phyllis Brown The minor in Medieval and Renaissance studies offers students from all departments a cross-disciplinary and interdisciplinary program of study in Europe's Middle Ages and Renaissance. These periods lay on the edge of modernity, when the distinctive characteris - tics of the contemporary world began to form and when major new connections were made between Europe and Africa, the Middle East, East Asia, and the Americas. Study of these periods from many different points of view affords an opportunity to gain valuable perspec - tives on the ways that Medieval and Renaissance persons, events, and institutions helped to shape the modern world. Completion of the minor is noted on the student's transcript, and students receive a certificate acknowledging their accomplishment.INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 301 REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in Medieval and Renaissance studies: Seven courses selected from three different departments with a maximum of three lower-division courses One of the upper-division courses must require an interdisciplinary research paper based on source materials and secondary works dealing with a topic rooted in the Medieval and/or Renaissance periods.

Musical theatre is prominent in America as art, entertainment, social commentary, and civic engagement; it therefore plays a part in Jesuit education of the whole person for the service of others. The objectives of this program include entry-level proficiency for a career in performance, enhancement in teaching, or further training in graduate school; audition techniques; performance of acting, singing, and theatrical dance; and knowledge of the cultural history and various forms of musical theatre. The student may pursue and declare one of two tracks: American musical theatre or lyric theatre (opera/operetta). REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Theory: MUSC 1 and 1A Singing: MUSC 34 and three quarters of on-campus private voice instruction Acting: THTR 24, 123 Dance: DANC 40 and 43 for American track; DANC 40 and 46 (or higher level dependent upon proficiency) for lyric theatre track Students in American theatre option: DANC 55 or 155, THTR 165 and 80 or 180 Students in lyric theatre option: MUSC 109, 153, and 194304 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES PRE-HEALTH SCIENCES Advisor: Steven L. Fedder Santa Clara University has an excellent reputation for preparing students for careers in the health sciences. Most incoming students tend to be focused on either allopathic medi - cine or dentistry, but a much broader spectrum of careers can be equally or more attractive including osteopathic medicine, physical therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, public health professional, and others. A Santa Clara education provides ample opportunity to acquire the academic foundations in natural science required by med - ical schools, and its broad liberal arts Core Curriculum also serves to develop the commu - nication, personal interaction, and analytical skills needed both during medical school and in one's subsequent medical practice. Although Santa Clara does not have a pre-med major, the courses prescribed by the Council of Education of the American Medical Association can be incorporated into several academic majors. Most medical schools require: One year of general chemistry (CHEM 11, 12, and 13) One year of organic chemistry (CHEM 31, 32, and 33) One year of biology (BIOL 21, 24, and 25) One year of physics (PHYS 11, 12, and 13 or PHYS 31, 32, and 33) One year of mathematics, typically calculus (MATH 11 and 12), and a statistics course In addition, many students become more skilled and competitive by enrolling in two or three upper-division science courses, often but not exclusively in biochemistry, genetics, and human physiology, which are helpful in preparing for the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The combination of Core Curriculum requirements with the University's focus on community involvement and issues of diversity will prepare students well for the newly revised MCAT 2015, with its greater emphasis on social, economic, and psychological determinants of health. The choice of academic major is much less important than com - pleting the coursework above; however, many pre-health students select a natural science major such as biology, biochemistry, chemistry, or public health science. Students should thoroughly examine the Pre-Health Advising website at www.scu.edu/cas/prehealth, and should maintain regular contact with the pre-health sciences advisor throughout their undergraduate years for assistance with adjusting to college academic rigor and social life; developing an appreciation of the wide array of available health care careers; achieving a balance between academics, social life, work, health community volunteering, and intern - ships; selecting the relevant entrance examinations; and applying to graduate health science programs.INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 305 PRE-LAW Advisors: Brian Buckley, Lawrence Nelson, Terri Peretti, Diana Morlang, Melissa Donegan Santa Clara University provides a wide range of opportunities for undergraduates to build a strong pre-law foundation. Early in their undergraduate program, pre-law students should consult not only with their major advisor but also with one of the designated pre-law advisors. Consultation with a pre-law advisor familiarizes the student with the rigors of law school, the practice of law, the burden of law school debt, and the means to best secure employment as an attorney. Advisors will help formulate a program to prepare students for the complexity of the application process, including preparation for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT). There is no specific major or curriculum required to qualify for law school admission. Suc - cessful law school applicants come from a diversity of majors such as anthropology, philoso - phy, communication, political science, physics, English, history, biology, and economics. However, to successfully prepare for the LSAT, students are advised to select courses that deepen reading comprehension and promote logical reasoning. Law school admissions offi - cers generally recommend undergraduate preparation by selecting a major that demands dis - cipline, analytical ability, research skills, close reading of texts, creativity, verbal skills, and precision in written and oral work. The departments of Philosophy and Political Science offer a pre-law emphasis within the major (in philosophy, it is also available within the minor). Elective courses also provide valuable training and breadth of academic and analytical experi-ence. Some elective courses strengthen specific abilities, while others provide perspective on legal issues and topics. Possible electives include, but are not limited to, the following: COMMUNICATION COURSES COMM 20. Public SpeakingCOMM 170A. Communication Law ECONOMICS COURSES ECON 126.

Voice I: Voice, Speech, and Presentation Skills PRE-TEACHING Director: Carol Ann Gittens Santa Clara University is accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Creden - tialing to offer professional preparation for prospective elementary school, middle school, and senior high school teachers. The Department of Education in the School of Education and Counseling Psychology offers graduate programs for the multiple-subject credential for elementary grades and the single-subject credential for secondary grades, both with a cross- cultural language and academic development emphasis. The teaching credential program at SCU is combined with a Masters of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree. Students interested in teaching should consider completing an interdisciplinary minor in urban education offered through the College of Arts and Sciences. The Future Teachers Project (FTP), formerly known as the Eastside Future Teachers Project, works with students from traditionally underrepresented groups throughout Silicon Valley and the greater Bay Area, who are interested in becoming teachers. Through innova - tive outreach and support programs, the goal is to develop leaders who will make an imme - diate impact on their communities. FTP scholars are generally recruited during high school and once at SCU, are considered for the FTP scholarship, which contributes to under - graduate studies and the credential/MAT program. The FTP is managed through the Liberal Studies Program. Preparation for Multiple-Subject Credential Students interested in a career in elementary school teaching should fulfill the require - ments of the liberal studies major with a pre-teaching emphasis in the College of Arts and Sciences. Those requirements can be found in Chapter 3, College of Arts and Sciences. Students must demonstrate the subject matter competency component for the multiple- subject credential by passing the California Subject Examination for Teachers (CSET) for INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 307 Multiple Subjects. While students may sit for the examination whether or not they majored in liberal studies, both the examination and the liberal studies degree requirements are closely aligned with the state of California's elementary curriculum framework. Therefore, Santa Clara strongly recommends that students interested in being elementary school teach - ers major in liberal studies. An undergraduate minor in urban education is recommended for those students electing not to complete the liberal studies major. Students must also demonstrate basic educational skills by completing the Writing Skills exam that can be added to the CSET or by passing the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST). Preparation for Single-Subject Credential Students interested in a career in secondary school teaching in a particular subject matter area should fulfill the requirements of the academic major of their intended teaching spe - cialization. California teaching credentials are available in the following subject areas: agri - culture, art, biological sciences, business, chemistry, English, geosciences, health science, home economics, industrial and technology education, mathematics, music, physical edu - cation, physics, general sciences, social science, world language (English language develop - ment), and world languages other than English. Students must demonstrate specific subject matter competency by passing the CSET in the subject area they desire to teach. Complet - ing an undergraduate major in this subject area is not required but it is highly recom - mended. An undergraduate minor in urban education is also recommended. Students must also demonstrate basic educational skills by passing the CBEST. Selected California state credential coursework or examination requirements may be waived by successful completion of one or more specific undergraduate courses on the pro - visions and principles of the United States Constitution, such as POLI 1, HIST 96A, or HIST 96B. Requirements for Multiple-Subject and Single-Subject Credentials The minimum requirements for the multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential include: A bachelor's degree in a subject area from an accredited institution Demonstrated knowledge of the United States Constitution by completion of under - graduate coursework or passage of an approved examination Demonstrated basic educational skills (see sections above for specific program requirements) Completion of an approved program of professional education, including field experience achieved through student teaching or internship Completion of a state-approved subject matter preparation program or passage of the CSET, a subject-area competency examination, in the area one plans to teach For multiple-subject credential candidates only: Demonstrated knowledge of the various methods of teaching reading by passing the Reading Instruction Competence Assessment (RICA) examination308 COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES Fifth-Year Teaching Credential Program The multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential can be completed as part of the Masters of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program. This program requires a fifth year of study following the bachelor's degree and qualifies the student for a preliminary teaching creden - tial. The MAT program includes graduate coursework in educational foundations, curricu - lum design, teaching methods, and supervised student teaching. Students seeking additional information regarding the MAT program with a multiple-subject or single-subject teaching credential should contact the Graduate Department of Education in the School of Educa - tion and Counseling Psychology. URBAN EDUCATION Director: Carol Ann Gittens The interdisciplinary minor in urban education provides Santa Clara undergraduate students seeking to become elementary or secondary teachers with the basics in educational theory, urban school observation and reflective experiences, Constitutional history of the United States, and the sociological and psychological foundations of education. The urban education minor has two distinctive components. First, the minor contains foundational courses necessary for a career in education. Second, the minor focuses on societal problems such as poverty, crime, and prejudice, and how these issues impact today's youth and fami - lies. Through the urban education minor, students will critically evaluate the modern social challenges facing teachers and policymakers who struggle daily with how to strengthen the educational experience for children. This minor is recommended for students from diverse majors who are interested in careers that involve working directly with children and families from multicultural and multifaceted backgrounds. Students majoring in liberal studies may not minor in urban education. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINOR Students must complete the following requirements for a minor in urban education: POLI 1 or HIST PSYC 185 or PSYC 172INTERDISCIPLINARY MINORS AND OTHER PROGRAMS OF STUDY 309 GERONTOLOGY CERTIFICATE PROGRAM Director: Patricia M.

Development of students' decision-making and managerial skills are the major objectives of the Department of Marketing program, with special emphases in innovation, high technology, retailing, and digital marketing. Marketing links a business to its markets and customers and acts as the eyes and the ears for a firm, helping managers identify emerging market opportunities and antic - ipating customer needs and wants. It is also the firm's voice, handling communications with customers and deciding on advertising, sales, and social media messages. Finally, strategic marketing addresses competitive threats and opportunities, guiding a firm's efforts to deliver superior value. Because customer analysis and competitive advantage are so crucial to business success, a degree in marketing provides a solid foundation for a general management career leading to executive responsibilities. It can also provide the basis for a more focused career in such areas as advertising, retailing, sales, brand management, and market research.

This program is open to electrical engineer - ing majors with an approved grade point average in electrical engineering, mathematics, and physics courses. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins taking courses required for a master's degree before completing the requirements for the bachelor's degree and typically completes the requirements for a master of science in electri - cal engineering within a year of obtaining the bachelor's degree. Undergraduate students interested in the combined degree program are required to apply for the program between February of their junior year and December of their senior year. Students in this program will receive their bachelor's degree after satisfying the full undergraduate degree requirements. To earn the master's degree, students must fulfill all the requirements for the degree, including the completion of 45 units of coursework beyond that applied to their bachelor's degree. No course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelor's degree and the master's degree. However, completion of 10 or more units of coursework in electrical engineering taken for the master's degree satisfies the pro - fessional development requirement of the undergraduate program. The program of studies for the master's degree may include up to 20 units of electrical engineering upper-division elective coursework excluding ELEN 188 and 189. These undergraduate units can count toward a master's degree only if a grade of \"B\" or better is earned. Students who do not complete the combined degree program within six years of entering the University will automatically be transferred to the regular master's degree pro - gram. Although six years is the maximum timeframe for completing the combined degree, full-time students enrolling in February of their junior year normally complete both degrees within five years.

The Military Science Program is designed to develop management skills and leadership abilities for successful careers in both the corporate world and the military. Students who complete the ROTC program are eligible for appointment and commissioning as officers in the Army Reserve. Reserve commissions are tendered in all basic branches of the Army. A board of officers determines the branch in which students are commissioned based on their prefer - ence, leadership potential, academic background, and the needs of the service. The military science core curriculum consists of six lower-division classes in the ROTC Basic Course and seven upper-division courses in the ROTC Advanced Course. Cadets may take a summer course (MILS 24) in lieu of the six lower-division courses. The professional military education of ROTC cadets consists of two components: a baccalaureate degree from Santa Clara University (or one of the cross-enrolled universities) and at least one undergraduate course from each of five designated fields of study. Prior to commissioning, cadets must take at least one course in military history. The curriculum is divided into ROTC Basic Course requirements and ROTC Advanced Course requirements. To proceed to the ROTC Advanced Course classes, students must complete either the six required ROTC Basic Course classes or attend a summer class at Fort Knox, Kentucky. The director of the Military Science Program must approve exceptions to this progression. ROTC Basic Course Requirements The ROTC Basic Course, Fundamentals of Leadership and Management, includes the first-year and second-year courses (MILS 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, and 23) designed for beginning students who want to qualify for entry into the ROTC Advanced course and for those stu - dents who may want to try military science without obligations. A student can also qualify for entry in the ROTC Advanced Course by completing the summer training camp (MILS 24).

Many study abroad programs operate on a semester system with resulting units earned exceeding the usual maximum for courses completed on campus. Academic calendars abroad may differ significantly from the on-campus academic calendar at the University. Students should refer to the Academic Calendars Abroad section on the SCU Study Abroad website at www.scu.edu/studyabroad/students/policies/academics.cfm. Because the programs with which Santa Clara University is affiliated vary in length, SCU Study Abroad evaluates each program to determine the appropriate maximum and mini - mum units for the term. Approved programs offer students opportunities to integrate with the host culture and foster personal reflection in the context of rigorous study. Programs may allow students to pursue independent research, attend classes with local students, par - ticipate in community-based learning, or gain professional experience through academic internships, which, in turn, can serve as a basis for senior capstone projects. During their first two years at Santa Clara, students build a foundation for the academic work they will pursue abroad. Students are encouraged to work with their academic advisor early to plan for study abroad, and to explore their goals with SCU Study Abroad staff in the Global Engagement Office. SCU Study Abroad values diversity and inclusion and encourages students from all backgrounds to apply for study abroad. In addition, Santa Clara students are strongly encouraged to pursue opportunities in traditionally underrepre - sented geographic areas of the world. The goal is for student learning in the approved pro - grams to build on and extend the on-campus curriculum. Students from underrepresented academic disciplines such as the sciences, engineering, and fine and performing arts are strongly urged to apply. SCU Study Abroad is a privilege and the application process is competitive. The selec - tion process is designed to offer study abroad opportunities to students who have thought - fully selected programs that will significantly advance their academic, personal, and professional goals. Students are strongly encouraged to study abroad for a summer, quarter, or semester in a country and academic environment that will enrich their overall college experience and engender responsible participation in a global, multicultural society. Credit earned through SCU Study Abroad counts toward graduation requirements either as elective credit or, with appropriate approval, may fulfill major, minor, and Core requirements. Grades are calculated into the Santa Clara University GPA and all credit and grades appear on the Santa Clara University transcript. The University is committed to offering equal access to study abroad opportunities and therefore extends all available finan - cial aid to students to support SCU Study Abroad during the fall, winter, and spring. How - ever, matriculated students who study abroad while withdrawn from the University are ineligible for financial aid and scholarships, and financial aid is not available for summer study abroad programs. The SCU Study Abroad application process involves two steps: (1) approval of the application by the Global Engagement Office; then (2) approval of a program-specific application by the study abroad program. In addition, participation is contingent upon satisfactory completion of all program prerequisites and related courses, satisfactory academic progress toward the student's major, and participation in SCU Study Abroad mandatory pre-departure orientation and re-entry meetings. Normally, students apply for 426 UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS study abroad six months to one year prior to participation. During the selection process, the Global Engagement Office reviews applications with participation from faculty and staff from throughout the University. The Office reserves the right to redirect students to alternate programs due to institutional considerations. To apply for study abroad, students must be admitted to degree status at the University, have declared a major with the Office of the Registrar, and expect to have completed a mini - mum of 88 quarter units by the start of the academic program abroad. Normally, students participate in SCU Study Abroad during their junior or senior year, but sophomores with extenuating academic circumstances may request an exception to the eligibility policy. Santa Clara requires a cumulative grade point average of 2.75 for off-campus study; requirements for individual programs may be more rigorous. Successful applicants will meet or exceed Santa Clara's requirements and that of their proposed program. Priority admission may be given to applicants for Santa Clara's own programs, including exchanges. Students must receive approval through the on-campus application process to receive credit for major, minor, or Core requirements completed through study abroad. Students on disciplinary probation or any form of suspension are not eligible for any study abroad programs. Students who earn a grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in any course in the term preceding their program may become ineligible for off-campus study. Students must clear any outstanding balances with the Bursar's Office in accordance with the Bursar's Office payment schedule (see www.scu.edu/bursar/payment/) to remain eligible for participation. The University does not approve study in countries for which the U.S. Department of State (DOS) has declared a T ravel Warning (see www.scu.edu/studyabroad/safety/). Withdrawn students who study abroad may be eligible to receive a maximum of 10 units of elective credit toward graduation requirements, in keeping with the University's policy on transfer credit, but no credit earned while withdrawn from the University may count toward a stu - dent's major, minor, or Core requirements. Students should consult the policies governing units taken at other institutions in Chapter 8, Academic and Administrative Policies and Regulations. For detailed information about individual programs, including eligibility requirements, contact SCU Study Abroad at studyabroad@scu.edu or 408-551-3019, or visit the SCU Study Abroad website at www.scu.edu/studyabroad/. Students are urged to attend a Study Abroad 101 session to gain general information and to drop in for advising with SCU Study Abroad Staff in the Global Engagement Office, located on the first floor of Varsi Hall, for information about the competitive application process. Current approved study abroad programs are listed on the SCU Study Abroad website at www.scu.edu/studyabroad/. Note: Santa Clara University may be obliged to alter or eliminate programs at any time. Santa Clara directly administers study abroad programs in El Salvador, Costa Rica, and Germany. The El Salvador is available to students enrolled in other universities; the pro - grams in Costa Rica and Germany are available only to undergraduate students admitted to degree status at Santa Clara University.SCU STUDY ABROAD 427 El Salvador Co-Directors: Kevin Yonkers-Talz, T rena Yonkers-Talz The SCU Casa de la Solidaridad program in El Salvador is a summer or semester study abroad program. During the semester program, students integrate classroom learning with experiential community-based learning in marginal Salvadoran communities. Students live in community with other students as well as Salvadoran students and engage in community field placement projects for two full days per week. The summer program is designed for students interested in health professions. During the summer, students engage in a field - work placement four afternoons a week in either a hospital or clinic supervised by Salvadoran medical professionals. Students take one of two Spanish courses, depending on their lan - guage proficiency, and the field praxis course. For information about current courses offered, see www.scu.edu/studyabroad. The program is open to students from other Jesuit universi - ties and other institutions with which Santa Clara University has an affiliation Costa Rica The Costa Rica summer program offers students an opportunity to experience the astounding biodiversity of Costa Rica's natural ecosystems while appreciating the challenges this small Central American nation faces in sustainably developing its economy and provid - ing livelihoods for its people. Students enroll in two courses taught by Santa Clara University instructors and upon successful completion of the course requirements receive a total of 10 units of credit. Students have one week of pre-field instruction at Santa Clara, then spend three weeks studying in Costa Rica, staying at biological field stations or tourist facili - ties as well as doing brief home stays with Costa Rican families. Opportunities to meet Costa Ricans and other Latin American students, learn Spanish, and do community service complement the academic offerings, which focus on drawing, observing nature, under - standing rainforest ecology, and learning about sustainable development and ecotourism. Germany The Germany summer program is located in the city of Freiburg. German language courses are offered in conjunction with the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures at Santa Clara University. In addition to the language courses, a course in con - temporary German civilization is also offered. Lectures and seminars offer a survey of liter - ary, linguistic, cultural, historical, political, legal, and social developments in Germany. Depending on individual language skills, summer course participants may attend afternoon lectures and seminars.428 UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS UNIVERSITY HONORS PROGRAM Director: Leilani M. Miller The University Honors Program provides Santa Clara's most able students with intellectual opportunities based in small, seminar-style classes. With no more than 17 students each, seminars emphasize analytical rigor, effective expression, and interaction among professors and students. In the classroom and elsewhere on campus, students enjoy a level of collaboration exceptional even at Santa Clara. The University Honors Program comes in two levels. Level I is usually by invitation to admitted first-year students and includes a curriculum of 10 courses. Students who have established a grade point average of 3.65 after completing 32 units of study at Santa Clara may apply for admission to Level II. Six courses are required for students admitted at this level. The course of study combines broadly based, liberal learning with depth of specialization in a major field. Honors program classes are designed to fit within the curricula of the humanities, natural and social sciences, business, and engineering. Possible majors include every undergraduate field in the University. LOWER-DIVISION COURSES 11A. and 12A.

UNDERGRADUATE SUMMER SESSIONS The Summer Sessions Office, located in the Drahmann Advising and Learning Resources Center, coordinates a comprehensive schedule of undergraduate courses in most of the academic departments from June through September. Summer Sessions invites students to reach their educational goals through the convenience of accelerated courses. Over 160 summer courses are held on campus and online. Sessions are three, five, and 10 weeks in length. Eight (8) units constitutes full-time status for undergraduate students enrolled in summer courses. Content, prerequisites, and units of summer courses are equivalent to fall, winter and spring courses. For information about summer opportunities to study abroad, contact SCU Study Abroad in the Global Engagement Office. For more details, see the Study Abroad website at www.scu.edu/studyabroad/. Academic Regulations Most of the academic regulations that apply in the fall, winter and spring quarters also apply to the summer terms. Courses taken during summer sessions are included in the records of matriculated Santa Clara University students for the determination of GPA, class level, honors, probation, and disqualification. Any student who is not permitted to register during fall, winter, or spring quarters (e.g., disqualified, suspension) may not enroll for summer courses at SCU.430 UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment The Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment policy is not in effect during the summer as it is during the fall, winter and spring quarters. Students who are officially enrolled in a class and fail to attend the first and any subsequent class meetings will remain enrolled in the class, and be responsible for paying all tuition and fees associated with the class. Students are responsible for dropping a course if they are unable to attend due to changes in the class schedule or personal obligations. Non-attendance does NOT relieve a student of the obligation to pay tuition and fees. In addition to paying full tuition and fees, an academic hold will be placed on the student's account to prevent any further registration transactions. Students who do not formally drop a class for which they are officially enrolled will receive an \"F\" grade for the course(s), and be liable for all tuition and fees incurred dur - ing the summer. Students must formally drop a course via eCampus or by submitting a Drop Form to the Enrollment Services Center prior to the published deadlines. Auditing Courses Non-SCU and non-degree seeking SCU students may not audit courses. Degree-seeking students may audit one course in addition to the summer sessions course load limit on a space available basis. Students will be charged a course audit fee. Permission to audit must be given by the instructor by the last day to add a class. Students should submit completed audit forms to the Enrollment Services Center by the last day to add a class. Course Load Limits Policy/Overload Policy There are NO EXCEPTIONS to the course load policy for summer sessions. Students who register for more than the maximum course load will be administratively withdrawn from the course that creates the overload. Students who add overload units in violation of this policy may not receive credit for the course that causes the policy violation. The intensive pace of Sessions 1, 2, and 3 require the following restrictions on summer course loads: Session 1: Students may not enroll in or attend more than two courses at any time during this session (maximum of 10 units). Session 2: Students may not enroll in or attend more than two courses at any time during this session (maximum of 10 units). Session 3 (A, B, and C): Students may not enroll in or attend more than one Session 3 lab science (Chemistry or Physics) course at a time. If enrolled in or attending a Session 3 lab science course, students may not be simultaneously enrolled in or attending any Session 1, 2, or 4 course. If enrolled in or attending a Session 3 non-lab science course, students may be simultaneously enrolled in or attend no more than one course during Session 1, 2, or 4. Course Cancellations Santa Clara University reserves the right to make changes in the schedules or policies without prior notice or obligation. If a course is canceled, the Summer Sessions Office will immediately send a notification to your @ scu.edu address. Please check your SCU email frequently.UNDERGRADUATE SUMMER SESSIONS 431 Enrollment and Course Restriction Policy Students may not sit in classes without formally enrolling. Credit is not given to students who attend class without formally enrolling and paying tuition. Students must be officially registered in classes based on the procedures outlined on the Summer Sessions website and must have paid all tuition and fees by the published deadlines. The instructor's signature on an add form after the add period does not constitute a formal enrollment without tuition payment. Initial registration or class additions will not be accepted beyond the late registra - tion/add period as set forth in the Summer Sessions calendar. Students who enroll in a course for which they are not eligible are subject to administra - tive withdrawal from that course. This includes: Students who have not satisfied course prerequisites Students who have not obtained the instructor's permission as specified in certain courses Independent Study Eligible Santa Clara University juniors and seniors may pursue independent study with the approval of a faculty member. Interested students should review the Independent Study section in the Undergraduate Bulletin for additional information.

If a student decides to drop a minor, he or she must submit a Program Petition form to the Drahmann Center.440 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Second Bachelor's Degree A student may earn a second bachelor's degree at Santa Clara University, but may not duplicate a degree (i.e., bachelor of arts, bachelor of science in a natural science, bachelor of science in a social science, bachelor of science in commerce, bachelor of science in engi - neering). Students whose first degree is from Santa Clara and who are interested in pursuing a second bachelor's degree concurrently or without interruption must have an academic record showing a strong probability of success and a proposed program of study for the second degree that fulfills the degree requirements in effect at their original date of matricu - lation. At least half of the units for the second degree must be in addition to those required for the first degree and must be completed through a Santa Clara program. Approval to pursue a second bachelor's degree must be granted by the Dean of Academic Support Services and filed with the Office of the Registrar. If a student is returning to the University after an absence, they must meet the criteria outlined above, but is subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of re-entry. Approval from the Dean of Academic Support Services is required to resume studies for a second degree after an absence. Students whose first degree is from an institution other than Santa Clara must submit a formal application for admission to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. The applica - tion must specify that the second degree will not duplicate any other degree. Students admitted for a second bachelor's degree are subject to the degree requirements in effect at the time of admission. At least half the units required for the second bachelor's degree must be earned through a Santa Clara program. Graduation with Honors Candidates for a bachelor's degree with a grade point average between 3.50 and 3.69 graduate cum laude (with honors); candidates with a grade point average between 3.70 and 3.89 graduate magna cum laude (with high honors); and candidates with a grade point average of 3.90 or higher graduate summa cum laude (with highest honors). Awarding of honors is based on all graded undergraduate courses attempted at Santa Clara University and courses taken elsewhere that are counted toward the fulfillment of a student's degree. Honors will not be awarded above those merited by the student's record at Santa Clara. An indication of honors at graduation contained in the commencement program is unof - ficial. The final determination will be made after a review of all completed undergraduate courses counted toward the degree. Participation in Commencement To participate in commencement, candidates for a bachelor's degree must have com - pleted all degree requirements (or must have 10 or fewer units to complete) and a minimum overall grade point average of 2.0 as well as in all courses in their academic major(s) and academic minor(s). Candidates must clearly demonstrate that all course work will be com - pleted either summer or fall of 2016 and must have completed and submitted a Candidacy Petition for the Bachelor's Degree form to the Office of the Registrar.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 441 ACADEMIC PROGRAM POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Course Numbering and Course Credits Lower-division courses are numbered 1 through 99, and upper-division courses are numbered 100 through 199. In the College of Arts and Sciences and the Leavey School of Business, most lower-division courses carry 4 units of academic credit and most upper- division courses carry 5 units of academic credit. In the School of Engineering, unit values for courses vary according to the number of hours in class per week. Credit Unit Policy Academic work at Santa Clara University is measured by credit unit. A unit of credit represents that amount of time and effort both within and outside of formal settings that a student devotes to a particular class. At the undergraduate level, one unit of credit represents approximately three hours of work per week per term by the student, including time engaged in class and time committed to class preparation, studying, and assigned projects. A unit of credit for laboratory courses, independent study, internships, practica, and study abroad is awarded on the same basis as for a lecture course: one unit of credit repre - sents approximately three hours of work per week per term by the student. At the graduate level, course credit is determined by the college or school and is consistent with practices in the disciplines. Change of Academic Major A change of major within the same school or college requires the approval of the relevant department chair or program director. Students wishing to change their academic major within a school must submit a Program Petition form to the Drahmann Center. Change of School Entering first-year students are admitted to the University and to a specific school based on the preference indicated on their admission application. Students wishing to change schools within the University may not apply for such a change until the end of their first year of attendance. Changes between schools may be limited by the availability of space within the school and the specific academic major. Students wishing to change schools must meet the admit - tance criteria of the school and complete the application process specified by that school. Upon acceptance by the school, the student must submit a completed Program Petition form to the Drahmann Center. Repetition of Courses Students may only repeat a course in which they have received a grade of less than \"C-.\" In such cases, the grades of both the original and the repeated course are included in the calculation of the student's grade point average, but units are awarded toward graduation only once for each course passed. Certain courses, such as special topics courses and perfor - mance courses, are repeatable, and students will receive a grade and units for each successful completion. Students should consult the chair of the department in which the course is offered to confirm that a given course may be repeated for credit.442 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Independent Study Students may pursue independent study through directed reading, directed research, internships, practica, or cooperative education. To qualify, a student must have demon - strated a sufficient knowledge of the academic discipline involved to make independent study both possible and beneficial. No more than 20 units of independent study may be used to satisfy graduation requirements, and no more than 5 units of independent study may be taken per term. Students must enroll for the term in which the independent study occurs. Directed reading and directed research are limited to upper-division students who undertake a research project or other well-defined study beyond the scope of a regular course under the supervision of a faculty member. Such work should be comparable to that required for courses of equivalent unit value. Students can obtain practical learning experience through internships, cooperative edu - cation, and practica. Internships and cooperative education are approved work experiences in a non-classroom environment in industry, government, or other setting, generally avail - able only to upper-division students. Students who enroll in an internship or cooperative education experience for academic credit must fulfill specified academic requirements in addition to the responsibilities expected by the organization hosting the internship or coop - erative education experience. Practica provide practical experience in a discipline-specific field experience or an approved University program activity, such as participation on the school newspaper. Practica are generally available only to upper-division students, but some practicum experiences are available to lower-division students who meet specified eligibility criteria. Students wishing to enroll in an independent study course must initiate the request for independent study with the appropriate faculty member, or with the Career Center for cooperative education experiences. The appropriate form, with the required materials and other approvals, must be submitted to the Drahmann Center for final approval prior to registering for the course. Challenging Courses Students may challenge certain courses to satisfy specific subject requirements for gradu - ation. A student may petition to challenge any course listed in the Undergraduate Bulletin except those involving laboratory, studio, or specialized group work and those whose descriptions in the catalog are followed by the letters NCX. No more than one course may be challenged each term. Although course requirements may be fulfilled by challenging a course, a successful challenge neither earns units toward the total needed for graduation nor contributes to the fulfillment of the residency requirements. In order to be eligible to challenge a course, a student must have completed at least one term at Santa Clara, have a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.3, and receive per - mission of the faculty member and the chair of the department in which the course is offered. Only currently enrolled students are eligible to challenge a course. To challenge a course, the student takes a special examination on the material covered by that course and meets any additional requirements specified by the department chair. Challenge examinations are arranged by the department chair, after the student files a Petition for Credit by Examination with the Office of the Registrar and pays the applicable fee.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 443 Undergraduate Class Attendance Policy Students are responsible for completing all course requirements as set forth by the instructor. Class attendance expectations and consequences for absences from class are left to the discretion of individual instructors subject to restrictions imposed by law, including, but not limited to, policies associated with the Americans with Disabilities Act As Amended (ADAAA) and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) (see below). The instructor's policies will be communicated clearly in writing. Students are accountable for all course assignments, whether or not the assignments were announced during an absence, and for meeting assigned deadlines, even when the deadline falls on the day a student is absent from class. For details on grading, see the Grading Policies and Regulations section in this chapter. In certain situations involving unavoidable absence, students may be offered the oppor - tunity to make up a missed assignment/activity or to complete an alternative assignment, unless the design of the course offers no opportunity for in-class work to be made up. These include both foreseen and unforeseen documented and verified situations such as: Serious personal illness Death of immediate family member Participation in significant religious observances Participation in events or activities as official representatives of Santa Clara University In cases of unforeseen, unavoidable absence, students should contact the instructor as soon as possible. Under certain circumstances, the Cowell Center or the Office of Student Life may contact the instructor on behalf of the student. In cases of foreseen absence due to significant religious observances or official representa - tion of the University in events, students should discuss the conflict with the instructor well in advance of the absence in order to determine possible alternate arrangements. Class attendance expectations and consequences for absence are left to the discretion of individual instructors. Instructors may require documentation from the appropriate University per - sonnel regarding the reason for the intended absence. Title IX and ADAAA The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendment Act (ADAAA) requires that the University ensure that all students have equal access to academic and University programs. Students with particular disabilities who are registered with the Disabilities Resources Office may be qualified to receive an accommodation that includes flexibility in class attendance. The federal Department of Education has issued a clarification of laws associated with Title IX and class attendance. To be in compliance with Title IX, a school must offer appropriate accommodation to a student whose absence is related to pregnancy or childbirth for as long as the student's doctor deems the absence to be medically necessary. See \"Supporting the Academic Success of Pregnant and Parenting Students Under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\" U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, June 2013.444 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Final Examinations A final examination, if given in a course, must be given on the date and time scheduled by the Office of the Registrar. If the final examination is a take-home examination, it may not be due before the scheduled final examination time or any later than the last day of the examination period. Similarly, other end-of-quarter assignments (papers, projects, for example) may not be due any later than the last day of the examination period. Exceptions to this policy require approval of the department chair and the relevant academic dean. REGISTRATION POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Enrollment and Registration for Classes Students must be officially registered for all classes in accordance with the regulations, procedures, and dates in the Schedule of Classes. Registration is subject to full payment of tuition, room and board charges, and other fees associated with enrollment. The University reserves the right to deny registration to any student for reasonable cause. A student's eligi - bility to register for classes is subject to the clearance of any holds on the student's record for academic, financial, student conduct, or other reasons. Santa Clara students may not be concurrently enrolled at another college or university except for extraordinary reasons with the approval of the Drahmann Center. Students register for classes via University eCampus during the time assigned by the Office of the Registrar. Students who do not complete registration during the initial regis - tration period may do so during the published late registration period for the term. Initial registration for a term or class additions are not accepted after the last day of the late registra - tion period. During the first week of each term, students may add and drop classes in accordance with the procedures established by the Office of the Registrar. During the first, second, third, and fourth weeks of the term, a student may drop a class without receiving a mark of \"W\" for the class on their academic record. From the fifth week to the end of the seventh week of the term, a student may drop a class and receive a mark of \"W\" for the class on their academic record. Students may not drop classes after the last day of the seventh week of the term. Students who do not complete a course and do not drop the class in accordance with the required procedures will receive an appropriate grade in the class. Students who have not earned 44 units, including transfer credit, may be subject to administrative withdrawal from upper-division courses. This restriction does not apply to upper-division foreign language courses for which a student has demonstrated sufficient proficiency or to engineering courses in the major program. Students may not sit in a class without formally enrolling in the class. Sitting in a class or obtaining an instructor's signature on an add form does not constitute enrollment. Students who do not attend the first day of a class are subject to administrative cancella - tion of their enrollment in that class in order to make space available to other students. A student who must miss the first day of a class and wishes to remain in the course should contact the instructor in advance. No student who misses the first day of a class should assume that they have been dropped from the course. Students are responsible for checking the status of their enrollment in all courses prior to the end of the late registration period.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 445 Unit Overload Students may enroll for no more than 19 units unless they are in the University Honors Program, their cumulative grade point average at Santa Clara is at least 3.3, or they have upper-division status and obtain approval from the Drahmann Center. One 2-unit course or two 1-unit courses are not counted as overload units. Students who meet the criteria above will not be permitted to register for more than 25 units without approval of the Dean of Academic Support Services. Students may register for courses that result in overload units only during the late registration period. See the website of the Office of the Registrar for registration schedules. Auditing Courses Students admitted to degree status at Santa Clara may audit one course in addition to their regular course load in a term. A maximum of three courses may be audited during a student's academic career. Permission to audit a course will be given only at the end of the late registration period and only if space is available in the class. No credit is assigned for an audited course, but the successful completion of an audit will be indicated on a student's transcript by the notation \"AUD.\" Administrative Cancellation of Course Enrollment Students who enroll in a course for which they are not eligible are subject to administrative cancellation of their enrollment in that course. Prior to the end of the late registration period, an instructor may notify the University registrar to drop first-year students who registered in upper-division courses, to drop students who have not satisfied the prerequisites for the course, or to drop students lacking the instructor permission required for certain courses. Withdrawal from the University Students who wish to withdraw from the University must do so by the last day of classes, and must complete a withdrawal survey, appropriate forms, and an exit interview in the Drahmann Center. If the formal requirements for withdrawal are met, the student's registra - tion will be canceled without further academic penalty. Students who leave the University during a quarter without withdrawing in accordance with the required procedures will receive an appropriate grade in all courses in which they were registered and are not eligible for a refund of tuition or other fees. Students who withdraw from the University are responsible for any outstanding finan - cial obligations with the University. Students who used deferred payment plans or student loans during their attendance at the University must clear their financial obligations with the Financial Aid Office and the Bursar's Office. Students who have unpaid bills or other unsettled financial obligations with the University will not receive academic transcripts or be eligible for re-enrollment until they have cleared all such obligations. Withdrawal for Health Reasons Students may experience an illness, injury, or psychological condition that significantly impairs their ability to function successfully or safely in their role as students. In these instances, the Policy for Withdrawal for Health Reasons allows time away from the University for treatment and recovery until functioning is restored to a level that will enable the student to return to the University. The purpose of this policy is to set forth the procedures for student withdrawals from the University for reasons of health and/or safety. The University has designated four categories relating to withdrawal. They differ according to who initiates the action, whether it is voluntary or not, and the re-enrollment procedures.446 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS The vice provost for student life or designee, in consultation with the appropriate mental and medical health professionals and other staff as deemed necessary, is responsible for the implementation of this policy as stated in the Student Handbook. Re-enrollment at the University A student who withdrew from the University is eligible to re-enroll without special permission under the following conditions: The student left the University in good academic standing The student has no outstanding financial obligations with the University The student plans to return to the same college or school at the University The student is returning within five years of the date of their withdrawal Students who do not meet the conditions above must seek permission to re-enroll from the Dean of Academic Support Services. Re-enrolling students are subject to degree and curriculum requirements in the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect at the time of re-entry. Students wishing to re-enroll must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing of their intent to return using the Returning Student form and should consult with a University advisor in the Drahmann Center to review their academic plans. Students on leave who have attended another college or university are only permitted to transfer in a maximum of 10 units of elective credit and are required to forward to the Office of the Registrar an official transcript of all work completed during their absence. GRADING POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Grading Grades are assigned by the instructor to reflect the quality of a student's work. The University uses the following grades: A: Excellent B: Good C: Adequate D: Barely Passing F: Not Passing P: Pass NP: No Pass The grades A, B, C, and D may be modified by (+) or (-) suffixes, except that the grade of A may not be modified by a (+) suffix. Grade point values per unit are assigned as follows: A = 4.0 A- = 3.7 B+ = 3.3 B = 3.0 B- = 2.7 C+ = 2.3 C = 2.0 C- = 1.7 D+ = 1.3 D = 1.0 D- = 0.7 F = 0ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 447 Unit credit, but not grade point credit, is awarded when the grade of \"P\" is assigned. Unit credit is not awarded when the grade of \"NP\" is assigned. The University also uses the following marks for which no unit credit or grade point value is granted: I: Incomplete N: Continuing work NS: No Show AUD: W: Withdrawn Pass/No Pass (P/NP) A grade of \"P\" signifies that the quality of work done is equivalent to a letter grade of \"C\" or higher, while a grade of \"NP\" denotes work at the level of \"C-\" or lower. A maximum of six courses taken under the pass/no pass option in which the student receives a mark of \"P\" can be used to fulfill the unit requirements for graduation. Some courses are offered only on a pass/no pass basis. If a graded option is not available, a course can satisfy Core, major, and/or minor requirements. A student with junior or senior standing and a declared major may choose to take an elective course on a pass/no pass basis. Students may enroll in only one elective course on a pass/no pass basis per quarter. Students may choose the pass/no pass option for a class through the end of the fourth week of classes, but may not change the grading option after that date. Incomplete (I) The mark of \"I\" (incomplete) may be assigned by the instructor when a student does not complete some essential portion of the assigned work in a class because of extraordinary circumstances beyond the student's control. The unfinished work must be completed and given to the course instructor within three weeks of the beginning of classes in the next scheduled term (not the student's next term of enrollment), excluding summer session, unless extraordinary circumstances require an extension. A request for an extension must be submitted in writing by the instructor and approved by the University Registrar within the original three-week period. Extensions shall not be for longer than two academic quarters after the mark of \"I\" was assigned, excluding summer session. An incomplete that has not been completed within the specified deadline or has not received an approved extension will be converted to a grade of \"F .\" Continuing Work (N) The mark of \"N\" (continuing work) may be assigned by an instructor when course requirements span more than one term. When the course requirements are completed, the instructor assigns a standard grade. A student may not graduate and receive a degree with a mark of \"N\" on their academic record. No Show (NS) The mark of \"NS\" (no show) may be assigned by an instructor when a student never attends a class and does not drop the class. A mark of \"NS\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark after it is assigned by the instructor. A mark of \"NS\" is included in the stu - dent's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included in the calculation of the student's grade point average. No adjustment in tuition will result from the awarding of a mark of \"NS\" in a class.448 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Audit (AUD) The mark of \"AUD\" is assigned when a student enrolls in a class on an audit basis. A mark of \"AUD\" cannot be changed to any other grade. Withdrawn (W) The mark of \"W\" is assigned by the Office of the Registrar when a student completes the formal requirements for dropping a class or withdrawing from the University. A mark of \"W\" cannot be changed to any other grade or mark. A mark of \"W\" is included in the student's academic record and appears on the student's transcript, but is not included in the calculation of the student's grade point average. Grade Point Average A student's grade point average is determined by multiplying each grade point value by the number of quarter units assigned to the course, adding these grade point units from all courses taken, and dividing this sum by the total number of quarter units for which letter grades were reported. Grade reports are posted at the end of each quarter and indicate both the grade point average earned by the student during the quarter and the cumulative grade point average earned by the student for all courses completed to that point. Grades earned in courses in SCU-operated or SCU-affiliated study abroad or domestic study programs are included in the calculation of a student's grade point average. Grades earned in courses at other institutions accepted for transfer credit are not included in the calculation of a student's grade point average, but will be considered when determining honors at graduation. Evaluation of Progress Grades are available at the end of the term via University eCampus. Faculty members are expected to apprise students of their course progress at reasonable intervals. Some measure - ments of progress should take place in time to enable students to make reasonable decisions with respect to the fourth-week and seventh-week withdrawal deadlines. Change of Grade Only the faculty member responsible for a course may assign grades. All grades become final when they have been assigned and reported to the Office of the Registrar. A faculty member may report a correction of a final grade to the Office of the Registrar only if a cleri - cal or procedural error was made in assigning, transmitting, or recording the original grade. A grade may not be changed as a result of re-evaluation, re-examination, or the submission of additional work after the term ends. Any grade change must have the approval of the department chair and the associate dean of the student's school or college. No grade may be changed after one year. Student Appeals of Grades Grades are not negotiable. There should be no questioning of a faculty member's academic judgment on a grade. In registering for a class, students implicitly agree to allow the faculty member to make a qualitative judgment of their command of the subject matter, which will be expressed as a letter grade. Any questioning or appeal of a grade should therefore be limited to procedure, e.g., to computational errors or failures to follow grading policies set forth in the syllabi.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 449 Any system of grade-appeal should protect the rights of faculty members as well as the rights of students. The results of any system of grade-appeal should not be binding upon the faculty member. Any decision to initiate a change of grade should remain the faculty mem - ber's. Any procedural complaint regarding a change of grade must be initiated within four weeks of the beginning of the next scheduled term, not including summer sessions. A student with a complaint must first discuss the matter with the faculty member. If the matter is not resolved at this level, the student may then take the matter to the chairperson of the department involved. The chairperson will discuss the case with the faculty member and may recommend that the faculty member review the grade. Upon the request of the student, the dean will proceed in similar fashion. Should the student request it, the dean will pass the matter on to the provost. This process of review gives the chairperson, dean, and provost the right to discuss the matter with the faculty member, and if they think it appropriate, request that the faculty member review the grade. Any recommendations made will not be binding upon the fac - ulty member against whom the complaint is lodged. The decision to change a grade remains with the faculty member. ACADEMIC STANDING AND STUDENT CLASSIFICATION Student Classification The University only admits students to its undergraduate degree programs on a full-time basis. Students who have not been admitted to degree status at the University may register for classes in accordance with the policies and regulations outlined in the section of this chapter covering non-degree students. The classification of students is determined by the number of quarter units completed with passing grades. Lower-division students are considered first-year if they have com - pleted fewer than 44 units and sophomores when they have completed at least 44 units but fewer than 88 units. Upper-division students are considered juniors when they have com - pleted at least 88 units but fewer than 131 units and seniors when they have completed at least 131 units. If a student is enrolled for 12 or more units in a given term, they have full-time status for academic purposes. Students enrolled for fewer than 12 units have part-time status for that term and may not qualify for all University activities and benefits, such as eligibility for financial aid, on-campus housing, and intercollegiate athletic competition. Continuing enrollment at the University in part-time status requires approval by the Dean of Academic Support Services. Academic Standing To be in good academic standing at the University, a student must normally be enrolled for 12 or more units, must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara, and must have completed at least a minimum number of units as specified below. Failure to meet these requirements may result in academic proba - tion or disqualification from future registration at the University. Students in their last term of enrollment before completing a degree may be classified as a full-time student when enrolled for less than 12 units.450 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Academic Probation Students at Santa Clara are subject to academic probation if their cumulative grade point average is lower than 2.0 based on all courses taken at Santa Clara. Students are also subject to academic probation if they fail to make satisfactory progress toward their degree as defined below: Completing at least 36 quarter units in the previous three quarters of residency or Completing at least 36 quarter units by the end of the third quarter of residency Completing at least 76 quarter units by the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing at least 115 quarter units by the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing at least 160 quarter units by the end of the 12th quarter of residency Academic Disqualification Students are subject to disqualification from further registration at the University for any of the following: Remaining on academic probation for more than two quarters without improvement Failing to maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 or Completing fewer than 30 quarter units by the end of the third quarter of residency Completing fewer than 64 quarter units by the end of the sixth quarter of residency Completing fewer than 100 quarter units by the end of the ninth quarter of residency Completing fewer than 150 quarter units by the end of the 12th quarter of residency Reinstatement to the University Reinstatement to the University after disqualification is rarely permitted and requires favorable action by the Dean of Academic Support Services in consultation with the dean of the student's college or school. Requests for reinstatement are made to the Dean of Academic Support Services and must include a description of any activities during the period of disqualification that would indicate that an improved academic performance can be expected in the future. A student generally may not apply for reinstatement within a year of the date of disqualification. The request for reinstatement will be considered only if the student's academic deficiencies can be corrected within a reasonable time. ACADEMIC CREDIT EVALUATION Santa Clara awards credit based on the Advanced Placement Program, the International Baccalaureate Program, University of Cambridge International Examinations, courses com - pleted at other colleges and universities, and courses completed in University-approved study abroad and domestic study programs using the criteria outlined herein. Students may not take a course for credit for which they have received advanced placement, International Baccalaureate, University of Cambridge, or transfer credit. Credit is not awarded for the College-Level Examination Program (CLEP).ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 451 Advanced Placement Credit Santa Clara participates in the Advanced Placement Program to recognize college-level academic achievement prior to matriculation and to encourage students to pursue advanced studies in their areas of interest. Credit or placement is determined by the appropriate department based on review of the student's Advanced Placement scores, sometimes in the context of supplemental departmental examinations. Students will be notified of advanced placement credit upon matriculation at the University. The following chart indicates the subject examination, required scores, and Santa Clara credit granted through the Advanced Placement tests. Courses waived will always satisfy relevant requirements in the major of the department that offers the course. However, only some courses waived will satisfy requirements in the Core Curriculum. Courses waived by AP test scores, when relevant, may satisfy Second Language, Mathematics, Natural Science, and Social Science requirements in the Core Curriculum. No other undergraduate Core requirement can be satisfied with AP test scores. Final decisions on academic credit for some AP scores are made individually by the appropriate academic department in consultation with the Office of the Registrar.

Students who transfer to Santa Clara University should consult Chapters 7 and 8 as well as the chapters relevant to their school or college. Units Taken at Other Institutions Credit is awarded for coursework completed at other colleges and universities subject to certain limitations. Courses from accredited institutions are generally transferable if they are similar in nature to courses listed in the Santa Clara University Undergraduate Bulletin . Courses from California community colleges are also generally transferable under the same conditions and if designated as transferable to the University of California. Courses of a trade or technical nature do not transfer. Courses from colleges not accredited, trade schools, extension programs, or correspondence programs do not transfer. T ransfer students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and uni - versities prior to matriculation at Santa Clara for no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for the specific Santa Clara degree. After enrolling at Santa Clara, students can receive credit for coursework completed at other colleges and universities for no more than 10 quarter units of free electives, subject to the limitation that no more than half of the total number of quarter units required for a Santa Clara degree can be earned at another institution. T ransfer credit earned after initial enrollment at Santa Clara may not be used to fulfill Undergraduate Core Curriculum, college or school, department, or program requirements.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 455 T ransfer credit for all coursework completed at other colleges and universities requires approval from the Office of the Registrar and the chair of the department offering the equivalent Santa Clara course. The student must have earned a grade of \"C\" or better in a course for transfer credit to be granted. Courses taken on a pass/no pass or credit/no credit basis are not accepted as transfer credit. Grades for units earned at other institutions are not included in a student's Santa Clara academic history or in the calculation of the Santa Clara grade point average. Study Abroad and Domestic Study Programs Qualified undergraduate students may apply to study abroad for a summer, quarter, or semester in a country and academic environment that will enrich their overall college expe - rience, contribute positively to the life of the University, and engender responsible participa - tion in a global, multicultural society. Units and grades earned through study abroad programs and domestic off-campus study programs that have been approved through regular University processes are included on the Santa Clara University transcript and may be used to fulfill major, minor and Core require - ments with prior approval by the department chair or Core Director. Grades earned in approved study abroad and domestic off-campus study programs are included in the calcu - lation of the Santa Clara grade point average. The third-level Core Curriculum requirement in Religion, Theology & Culture cannot be fulfilled with a study abroad course. Units earned for coursework in study abroad and domestic off-campus study programs not approved by the University through the regular application process are subject to the policies governing transfer credit and may not fulfill major, minor, or Core requirements. See the sections on transfer credit earlier in this chapter and in Chapter 7. NON-DEGREE STUDENTS The Santa Clara University undergraduate program is designed primarily for full-time, degree-seeking students. To maintain the University's commitment to its primary under - graduate constituency of degree students, non-degree students are permitted to register in accordance with the following policies subject to space availability in classes. Santa Clara Alumni Santa Clara alumni who have been awarded a degree from Santa Clara University may enroll in undergraduate classes on a for-credit basis or may audit undergraduate classes. Alumni may enroll for no more than 10 units per term on a for-credit basis, or they may audit one course per term. They are certified for enrollment by the Office of the Registrar and register for classes during the late registration period of the term. University Employees University employees who are students at another accredited college or university may enroll in undergraduate classes at Santa Clara if they are in good standing and have a cumu - lative grade point average of \"C\" or better at their home institution. They may not enroll concurrently at Santa Clara and another college or university. University employees who are not currently admitted to degree status are certified for enrollment by the Office of the Registrar and may audit one course per term.456 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS Students from Other Colleges and Universities Students from another accredited college or university may enroll in undergraduate classes at Santa Clara if they are in good standing and have a cumulative grade point average of \"C\" or better at their home institution. They may not be enrolled concurrently at Santa Clara and another college or university. Students from other colleges and universities may enroll for no more than three quarters, not including summer session, and are not eligible to audit classes. Students from other colleges and universities are certified for enrollment by the Drahmann Center and the Office of the Registrar and register for classes during the late registration period of the term. Students from Other Colleges and Universities Participating in SCU Exchange Programs Students from other colleges and universities participating in Santa Clara's non-degree Exchange and Visiting programs apply through the Global Engagement Office. Applicants are expected to meet all prerequisites and requirements of the specific partnership. Exchange and Visiting students may enroll in undergraduate classes at Santa Clara if they are in good standing and have a cumulative grade point average of \"C\" or better at their home institu - tion and meet all prerequisites required of the exchange agreement. They are not eligible to audit classes. Students from Other Institutions Enrolling in SCU Study Abroad Programs Students from other colleges and universities may apply to participate in SCU Study Abroad programs through the Global Engagement Office.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY The University is committed to academic excellence and integrity. Students are expected to do their own work and to cite any sources they use. A student who is guilty of a dishonest act in an examination, paper, or other work required for a course, or who assists others in such an act, may, at the discretion of the instructor, receive a grade of \"F\" for the course. In addition, a student found guilty of a dishonest act may be subject to sanctions, up to and including dismissal from the University, as a result of the student judicial process as described in the Student Handbook. A student who violates copyright laws, including those covering the copying of software programs, or who knowingly alters official academic records from this or any other institution is subject to similar disciplinary action.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 457 Academic Integrity Protocol Allegations within the Context of a Course These procedures are intended to protect the integrity of the instructional program and of student academic achievement. Any member of the Santa Clara University community with a suspicion or evidence of academic dishonesty of some kind as described in the Student Conduct Code (e.g., plagiarism, falsification of data, misrepresentation of research, or the use of prohibited materials during an examination, and other acts generally under - stood to be dishonest by faculty or students in an academic context) may initiate an allega - tion of student academic dishonesty. The following describes procedures for resolution by due process. If the allegation arises within the context of a course or academic assignment, its resolu - tion begins with the instructor responsible for that course or assignment, who informs the student of the suspicion. If the instructor judges on the basis of available evidence that an academic violation has occurred, the instructor applies an academic sanction and notifies the student of the reason for the academic sanction. The instructor decides on the severity of the academic sanction (e.g., refusal to accept an assignment, \"F\" on the particular assign - ment, or \"F\" for the entire course). The instructor will report in writing to the department chair and the Office of Student Life what violation of academic integrity has occurred and what academic sanction has been applied. The Office of Student Life will pursue the matter as a violation of the Student Conduct Code through the University judicial process. This process is not intended to limit academic freedom. Appeal Process for Academic Sanctions If, after discussion with the instructor concerning the academic sanction applied, the student wants to challenge the instructor's decision, the student will contact the chair of the department in which the course is offered. If the instructor is the department chair, then the appeal is made to the dean of the school or college in which the course is offered or designate, and the dean or designate refers the case to the chair of a closely related department. The department chair hearing the appeal has the option to convene an ad hoc panel if the complexity of the case warrants doing so. The student suspected of committing academic dishonesty has the right to bring a support person whose only role is to accompany the student to the hearing. The panel will include two full-time faculty members from the department in which the course was offered, one full-time faculty member from a closely related department, and two students who are trained student judicial board members. Staff in the Office of Student Life will arrange for the participation of the student panel members. The charge of the panel is to study all previously considered and newly developed evidence, review statements of all parties concerned, interview all parties concerned, and make a recommendation to the department chair. The parties involved have the right to file an objection to the appointment of a particular faculty member or student to the ad hoc panel. This objection must be based upon a belief that the named faculty member or student is unable to conduct an impartial evaluation and therefore will not review the case in an impartial manner. The objection is filed with the chair hearing the appeal who will make a ruling on this objection. If necessary, the chair will then appoint a different faculty member or student.458 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS After reviewing all relevant materials and information, including the recommendation of the ad hoc panel when one is convened, the department chair will consider all evidence available, confer with all parties concerned, inform all parties of the recommendation regarding the alleged violation, and report the recommendation to the student and the Office of Student Life. However, final responsibility for assigning grades remains with the instructor of the course. Decisions may only be appealed to one level above the instructor. All proceedings are intended to be confidential. If the student wishes to withdraw from the course, the instructor's approval is required for the withdrawal process. The instructor may refuse to approve of the withdrawal and may assign an appropriate grade. University Judicial Process When the Office of Student Life receives the report, the assistant dean will meet with the student to discuss the relevance of the violation to the Student Conduct Code. Whether further judicial sanctions are applied or not, the report of academic dishonesty will remain on file in the Office of Student Life for the remainder of the student's enrollment at Santa Clara University. The student involved has the right to include a statement as part of these files. If it is ruled that the student committed an academic integrity violation, the Office of Student Life will administer a judicial sanction that would range from a letter of warning to expulsion from the University. The severity of the judicial sanction depends on the sever - ity of the circumstances, including the student's judicial history and previous academic integrity violations. Allegations Outside a Course If the allegation involves a situation outside the context of a course, resolution begins with the Office of Student Life. The assistant dean will confer with all parties concerned. After hearing all evidence and conducting further investigation as needed, the assistant dean will either hear the case or refer it to a judicial board in accordance with the University Judicial Process. The outcome of the hearing will be communicated to those involved. PATENT POLICY For information on the University's Patent Policy, see the Office of Research Initiatives website at www.scu.edu/provost/research.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 459 ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS CLERY ACT In accordance with the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, Santa Clara University annually collects information about campus crimes and other reportable incidents as defined by the law. Information presented in com - pliance with this act is made available to assist current and potential students and employees in making informed decisions regarding their attendance or employment at the University. These reports and other information about the law are available on the Campus Safety website. It is the policy of Santa Clara University that the campus community will be informed on a timely basis of all reports of crime and other information affecting the secu - rity of our campus and the personal safety of our students, faculty, staff, and guests. COMMUNICATION BY THE UNIVERSITY TO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS The University will communicate with undergraduate students through a variety of for - mats. Information that is sent to undergraduate students from the University via their cam - pus mailbox, local address, or their Santa Clara email address is considered official communication and should be treated as such. Students are asked to check their campus mailbox and their Santa Clara email account on a daily basis, and are responsible for reading and responding to the information they receive from the University. The University urges undergraduate students to use their Santa Clara email address as their primary email; stu - dents who will not be checking that address regularly should forward their email to their preferred email account. CONSENSUAL RELATIONS BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS In addition to prohibiting sexual harassment under the Policy on Unlawful Harassment and Unlawful Discrimination, the University prohibits any consensual dating, romantic, or sexual relationship between an employee and a student over whom that employee has any instructional, supervisory, advising, or evaluative responsibility. Such a relationship is fraught with problems, including the potential for exploitation, favoritism, and conflict of interest. The appearance of impropriety or unfairness may also adversely affect the learning and work environment for other students and employees. This policy applies to faculty, staff, and student employees. Employees who violate this policy are subject to sanctions for misconduct under the policies of the Faculty Handbook, Staff Policy Manual, or Student Employment Handbook, as appropriate to their employment status. Employees or students with questions about this policy should contact the EEO and Title IX Coordinator or the Department of Human Resources. DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE AND SCHOOL PROGRAM It is the goal of Santa Clara University to maintain a drug-free workplace and campus. The unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, and/or use of controlled substances or the unlawful possession, use, or distribution of alcohol is prohibited on the Santa Clara University campus, in the workplace, or as part of any of the University's activi - ties. This includes the unlawful use of controlled substances or alcohol in the workplace even if it does not result in impaired job performance or in unacceptable conduct.460 ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS The unlawful presence of any controlled substance or alcohol in the workplace and campus itself is prohibited. The workplace and campus are presumed to include all Santa Clara premises where the activities of the University are conducted. Violations will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employ - ment for faculty and staff or expulsion of students. A disciplinary action may also include the completion of an appropriate rehabilitation program. Violations may also be referred to the appropriate authorities for prosecution. The program information is distributed on an annual basis to all faculty, staff, and stu - dents. New staff employees are given a copy at New Employee Orientation. New faculty employees are given a copy at New Faculty Orientation. The program is reviewed at least biennially by the Office of Student Life and the Department of Human Resources. STUDENT RECORDS AND RELEASE OF INFORMATION The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) protects the confiden - tiality of the University records of Santa Clara University students. A student is any person who attends or has attended a class, which includes courses taken through videoconference, satellite, Internet, or other electronic and telecommunication technologies, and for whom the institution maintains education records. The University is authorized under provisions of the Act to release directory information to any person on request, unless a student explic - itly requests in writing that the University not do so and keep directory information confidential. A student's directory information is designated as follows: Student's name Address: Campus post office box, local, and permanent addresses (residence hall and room numbers are not disclosed) Telephone number Email address Photograph Date and place of birth Major field of study Classification level/academic standing Dates of attendance (defined as academic year or quarter) Participation in officially recognized activities and sports Weight and height of members of athletic teams Degrees (including expected or actual degree date), honors and awards received, and dates Most recent educational agency or institution attended During the registration period and throughout the academic year, students may request in writing through the Office of the Registrar that directory information be kept confiden - tial. Once filed, the request remains in effect until the beginning of the next academic year or a shorter period if designated by the student. Graduating students must notify the Office of the Registrar in writing to remove the nondisclosure notation from their record.ACADEMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS 461 The University is authorized under FERPA to release educational and directory informa - tion to appropriate parties without consent if the University finds an articulable and signifi - cant threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals in light of the information available at the time. Former or current borrowers of funds from any Title IV student loan program should note carefully that requests for nondisclosure of information will not prevent the University from releasing information pertinent to employment, enrollment status, current address, and loan account status to a school lender, subsequent holder, guarantee agency, the United States Department of Education, or an authorized agent. Students have the right to inspect and review their educational records at the following offices: Official academic records, including application forms, admission transcripts, letters of acceptance, and a student's permanent academic record are on file and maintained in the Office of the Registrar Working academic files are maintained by the Drahmann Center Records related to a student's nonacademic activities are maintained in the Office of Student Life Records relating to a student's financial status with the University are maintained in the various student financial services offices Certain records are excluded by law from inspection, specifically those created or main - tained by a physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist in connection with the treatment or counseling of a student. Parents' financial information, including statements submitted with scholarship applications, is also excluded by law from inspection. Third parties may not have access to educational records or other information pertaining to students without the written consent of the student about whom the information is sought. Students have the right to request the amendment of their educational records to ensure that they are not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy or other rights. Students may direct complaints regarding academic records to the dean of the college or school in which they are enrolled or to the University registrar. In addition, stu - dents have the right to file a complaint with the United States Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of the Act. Written complaints should be directed to the Family Policy Compliance Office, Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington, D.C. 20202-5920.

Financial Aid Suspended The failure to make satisfactory academic progress, but the student appealed their pro - bationary status and was financial aid eligible for the period designated in the granted appeal. Financial Aid Ineligible The failure to make satisfactory academic progress (this status also applies to appeals that are not approved). The student is not eligible for financial aid until cumulative satisfactory academic progress standards are met. The student may not appeal. Appeal Process There may be extenuating circumstances encountered by a student that may affect his/her ability to be academically successful during an enrollment period. These circum - stances include personal injury or illness that occurs during an enrollment period; death of an immediate family member or legal guardian during an enrollment period; or other docu - mented circumstances that were unexpected in nature and beyond control of the student. In these cases, cumulative grade point average or completion rate may decline resulting in the student not meeting the minimum qualitative and quantitative standards previously described. If the student wishes to appeal the suspension from financial aid eligibility, a Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal form must be submitted to the Financial Aid Office.

Note: Before filing an appeal for reinstatement of financial aid, it is important that the student meet with an academic advisor and/or visits the Drahmann Advising and Learning Resource Center in order to explore ways of eliminating deficiencies and to establish a realistic plan towards graduation. Appeal Denials Students whose appeal was not approved will receive information regarding other alternatives available to them. Some options include: Continue enrollment at Santa Clara University without any financial assistance.

Withdraw from Santa Clara University to make up a portion or all of the deficient units at another institution. IMPORTANT: The student will have to file an additional appeal to have aid reinstated once s/he has completed the required units and demonstrated the ability to continue at Santa Clara University without incurring additional deficiencies. Loss of Eligibility A student who has lost eligibility to participate in federal, state, and University aid pro - grams for reasons of academic progress can regain that eligibility only by enrolling at Santa Clara University at his/her own expense. The mere passage of time will not restore eligibility to a student who has lost eligibility for failure to make satisfactory academic progress. Stu - dents who have been dismissed from Santa Clara University for academic reasons, but who are subsequently re-admitted are not automatically eligible to participate in federal, state, or institutional aid programs and will be placed on financial aid warning. Re-admission deci - sions are separate from funding decisions. Regaining Eligibility Students who failed to meet satisfactory academic progress and who choose to enroll without financial aid may request a review of their academic record after any term in which they are enrolled without the receipt of financial aid.

Bill), and Chapter 33 (Post 9/11 GI Bill). Individuals inter - ested in attending under any of the veteran's assistance programs should contact the Veterans Administration and the University Office of the Registrar. CANCELLATION OF FINANCIAL AID AND RETURN OF FUNDS Students who withdraw from the University and who have federal financial aid are sub - ject to the federal regulations applicable to the return of Title IV funds. These regulations assume that a student earns his or her financial aid based on the period of time he or she remains enrolled during a term. A student is obligated to return all unearned federal finan - cial aid funds governed under Title IV other than those earned under the college work-study program. Unearned financial aid is the amount of disbursed Title IV that exceeds the amount of Title IV aid earned in accordance with the federal guidelines. During the first 60 percent of the term, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time he or she remains enrolled. That is, the percentage of time during the term that the student remains enrolled is the percentage of disbursable aid for that period that the student has earned. A student who withdraws after the 60 percent point of the enrollment term earns all Title IV aid disbursed for the period. The amount of tuition and other charges owed by the student plays no role in determining the amount of Title IV funds to which a withdrawn student is entitled. All funds must be returned to federal programs before funds are returned to state or University financial aid programs or to the student. The return of funds allocation will be made in the following order for students who have received Federal Title IV assistance: Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loans (other than Direct PLUS Loans) Subsidized Federal Direct Loans Federal Perkins Loans Federal Direct PLUS Loans Federal Pell Grants for which a return is required Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants for which a return is required TEACH Grants for which a return is required Iraq and Afghanistan Grants for which a return is requiredTUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID 479 STUDENT VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION The United States Department of Education requires all institutions disbursing federal financial aid funds to verify the accuracy of the information students and their families submit as a basis for the award of aid. Santa Clara University complies with this requirement by participating in the Federal Quality Assurance Program. Each year, a percentage of stu - dents receiving federal financial aid funds are randomly selected for verification of the infor - mation on which their awards were based. Students selected for verification may be required to submit additional documents and verify information, such as household size and number of family members enrolled in college. The University reserves the right to request similar information for verification purposes for any student awarded aid and to verify the atten - dance of other children in college. Information collected may result in changes to a financial aid award and, in some cases, the repayment of funds already received. Failure to comply with the request for this information will result in the cancellation of financial aid funds. BILLING AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES STUDENT ACCOUNTS AND BILLING Students assume responsibility for all costs incurred as a result of enrollment at Santa Clara University and agree to abide by applicable University policies and procedures. Students may designate a third party (e.g., parent, family member, spouse) to be an authorized payer for their student account. That individual is authorized to access the stu - dent's billing statements and to make payments on the student's behalf. However, it is still the student's responsibility to make sure all financial obligations are completed by the pub - lished deadlines. Once authorization is completed, the authorized payer will be sent notifi - cation on the login process via the email address provided by the student. Authorized payers do not have access to any other student account information via this website. Students receive monthly bills electronically via a third-party vendor that are accessible through University eCampus. A billing notification will be sent to the student's University email address and to the email address of any payer authorized by the student. Students may also forward their billing statements electronically to any third party they authorize for remittance. Information on a student's account cannot be provided to any third party payer unless a completed Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act form authorizing its release by the student is on file with the University. Students are obligated to pay the applicable tuition and fees associated with their enroll - ment status by the published term payment deadline. Students enrolling after the initial payment deadline may be required to pre-pay for their enrollment. Registered students who do not withdraw formally from the University are responsible for all tuition and fees assessed to their account as well as any penalty charges incurred for nonpayment. Nonattendance does not relieve the student of his or her obligation to pay tuition and fees.480 TUITION, FEES, AND FINANCIAL AID PAYMENT METHODS Santa Clara University offers a variety of payment methods to students and their parents to assist with their financial obligations. Payment by Electronic Check A student or authorized payer may make online payments by authorizing a fund transfer directly from their personal checking or savings account through a third-party website accessible via the University eCampus system. The payer is able to make electronic check payments online without incurring a transaction fee. Payment by Mail Payments for student account charges are accepted by mail utilizing the University's cash management service lockbox. The payer should download a copy of the student's billing statement, enclose it with a personal or cashier's check payable to \"Santa Clara University,\" and mail both items to: Santa Clara University Bursar's Office, P .O. Box 742657, Los Angeles, CA 90074-2657.

EXTENDED PAYMENT OPTIONS For students and their families wishing to spread payments over a period of time, the University offers term payment plans, which are available through the online billing system via eCampus. There is a modest fixed fee to enroll in these plans, but no interest is charged during the payment term. Information about these plans is available on the Bursar's Office website. DELINQUENT PAYMENTS If all charges on a student's account have not been cleared by payment, financial aid, or loan disbursement, a late payment fee will be assessed to the student's account and a hold will be placed on the student's record. A hold on a student's record prevents the release of transcripts or diplomas, prevents access to any registration services, and may limit access to other University services. Students who have unpaid accounts at the University or who defer payment without approval are subject to dismissal from the University. All unpaid balances will accrue 10 percent interest per annum on the balance remaining from the date of default in accordance with California state law. Delinquent student accounts may be reported to one or more of the major credit bureaus and may be forwarded to an outside collection agency or an attorney for assistance in recov - ering the debt owed to the University.
