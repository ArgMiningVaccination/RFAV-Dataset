Ayurveda originates in 5,000-year-old Vedic teachings that describe how one can live in accord with nature to promote longevity and vitality. Like life, Ayurveda is an evolving practice, and its foundational texts developed over the next several millennia are still referenced by modern practitioners today. The practice of Ayurveda was prohibited under British colonialism during the 1800's in favor of their own medical system, fragmenting the teaching of Ayurveda for over 100 years until its revitalization in the 1980s led by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Vasant Lad, Deepak Chopra, Robert Svoboda, and others. As a result of its suppression, Ayurveda has struggled with being minimized by popular culture in India and the West, but there is a growing body of scientific research that show a wide range of health benefits including stress relief and cardiac health, reductions in heavy metal toxicity, and a healthier microbiome.
