Mindfulness practice has numerous benefits: Improved attention, increased emotion regulation, reduced anxiety and depression, and even improved immune function.

[Jon Kabat-Zinn](https://www.mindful.org/author/jon-kabat-zinn), a prominent mindfulness researcher, has developed a relatively simple skill you can practice whenever, wherever\u2014 without the need for a formal sitting meditation practice. It called the STOP skill, or STOP Acronym. Check out the video below to jumpstart your mindfulness practice today using the STOP acronym. STOP is an acronym for a practice that is primarily used to inject a little mindful experience throughout your day, whenever you need it most. Even after a good mindfulness meditation in the morning, it's easy to quickly get caught up in all of the stresses and activities of daily life. By applying mindfulness to these experience during your day, your mind will be on autopilot less, and you'll be able to check in with how you are feeling, what you are thinking, and what behavior you're engaging in. STOP acronym stands for: S: Stop. Whatever you're doing, just pause momentarily. T: Take a breath. Re-connect with your breath. The breath is an anchor to the present moment. O: Observe. Notice what is happening. What is happening inside you, and outside of you? Where has your mind gone? What do you feel? What are you doing? P: Proceed. Continue doing what you were doing. Or don't: Use the information gained during this check-in to change course. Whatever you do, do it mindfully. By occasionally reminding yourself to stop during your day, you can increase your awareness of what is going on around you and inside you. You may stop and notice you are engaging in a lot of negative self-judgments. Using STOP may help you recognize when your body is becoming tense, and allow you to correct it before you are in pain. You might find that you're hungry, or that a break might be helpful. The more you STOP during the day, the more you re-engage with reality, and disengage from the habitual busyness of your mind.
