Mind-Body/Body-Mind Therapy - Uses the power of thoughts and emotions to improve overall health and wellbeing. While focusing on the interactions between the mind and body fundamental to its approach are a variety of self-care related strategies that involve a whole lot \"TLC\" - otherwise known as therapeutic lifestyle changes. Emotion Focused Therapy - Is based on the idea that emotions are not only important factors in our lives, but hold the key to who we are. The focus of this approach is on attachment styles and human bonding. It addresses distress and conflict in adult relationships. It also provides a clear pathway towards more loving and secure emotional bonds while moving relationships in a healthier more positive direction.

Leading edge scientific discoveries reveal the frequency, function and flow of the body's electromagnetic and more subtle energies are important for physical, spiritual, and mental health and for fostering overall wellbeing. The BodyTalk System - Seeks to address the \"whole person.\" That means no aspect of the human psyche can be overlooked, be it emotional, physical or environmental.
