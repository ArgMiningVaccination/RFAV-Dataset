Remove the mushrooms, squeeze dry, and discard the stems. Dice, then set aside. Tear the black fungus into small pieces. Meanwhile, use a sharp knife to make 5-6 slashes on each side of the fish.

Heat the 4\u00bc cups (1 litre) oil in a wok or large frying pan to 180C, or until a cube of bread browns in 30 seconds. Add the fish and deep-fry for 4-5 minutes until golden brown and crispy. Use a slotted spoon to carefully remove the fish from the oil and drain on paper towels. Add the garlic and ginger to the remaining oil in the wok, add pork, and stir-fry over medium heat for 1 minute until fragrant. Sprinkle in the wine, then stir in the pickled chillies, chilli bean paste, mushrooms, fungus, soy sauce and sugar. Add 1\u00bd cups (350ml) boiling water and bring to a boil. Add the fish, reduce to medium heat, cover, and simmer for about 5 minutes until cooked through. Flip over and cook for another 5 minutes until cooked through. Transfer the fish to a serving plate. Bring the sauce in the wok to a boil. Simmer over medium heat, uncovered, for 2-3 minutes until the sauce has reduced. Finally, stir in the vinegar, white pepper, spring onions, and sesame oil. Pour the sauce over the fish, garnish with spring onions and red chilli, if using. 75g brown sugar 5tbsp red vinegar 3 tomatoes 150g precooked chitterlings (pig's intestines), cut into thin strips To make the sauce, combine the sugar and vinegar in a small bowl, mix well, and set aside.
