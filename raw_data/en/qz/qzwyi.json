It's about celebrating what's right and making sure you're on the path to a healthier, stronger you. We all require a different amount of sleep based on age but, as adults, most of us should be sleeping between seven and nine hours each night. However, lack of sleep has become a public health issue as 30 percent of adults report sleeping six or less hours on a regular basis. Short sleep duration and sleep disorders such as sleep apnea directly affect wellness by suppressing the immune system, negatively impacting cognitive functions, impairing the ability to focus and learn, decreasing fertility but also increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, high blood pressure, obesity, type 2 diabetes, autoimmune diseases, cancer and overall poor quality of life. Getting a good night's rest is one of the most important steps you can take to better your health. [Tereza Hubkova, MD](https://www.adventhealth.com/hospital/adventhealth-shawnee-mission/find-doctor/doctor/tereza-hubkova-md-1609837293), Medical Director of the [Whole Health Institute](https://www.adventhealth.com/adventhealth-whole-health-institute) at AdventHealth South Overland Park, offers some effective ways to improve sleep. Tips for Better Sleep - Avoid stimulants such as coffee, chocolate and soda before bed. - Avoid alcohol. - Avoid late night eating and after dinner snacking. - Exercise early in the day. - Go outside each morning for 30 minutes (walk your dog or go for a walk) to help align your circadian rhythm with natural light. - Have a ritual to help you de-stress. - Avoid electronics one to two hours before sleep, or at least wear blue light blocking glasses one hour prior to bedtime. - Keep your bedroom cool and dark. - Go to bed at the same time each night. According to Dr. Hubkova, sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome are fairly common in adults especially as we get older, and they are very often under-diagnosed or misdiagnosed as depression or attention deficit disorder, for example. If you are struggling with sleep, Dr. Hubkova and the providers at the Whole Health Institute can help you figure out the root cause: poor sleep may be related to stress, nutritional deficit, inflammation, pain, gastroesophageal reflux or another digestive issue, and even a toxic exposure. A simple home sleep study can be conducted to screen for sleep apnea. Call [913-632-3550](tel:9136323550) to learn more.
