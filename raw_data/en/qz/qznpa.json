He did an amazing job. The whole team was wonderful and took such great care of my boys. - He is the best Doctor in the world, l miss you so much Dr. Paikh, one day l will go there to see you,thank you so much, God bless you and your family - I highly recommend Dr. Parikh. my daughter had mastoiditis back in 2000, and Dr. Parikh was amazing as my daughter had many allergies to antibiotics and she was 1.5yrs old. He has wonderful bedside manner and he is a wonderful surgeon. My daughter is now 21 and the scar that was left behind was so small and right in the crease of her ear so it is not visible. He is simply amazing. - Dr. Parikh performed a total thyroidectomy and bilateral neck dissection on my son in June 2018. His professionalism and care towards us, but most importantly, our son, has been incredible. We are forever grateful for everything he has done to ensure our son has a long and healthy life. It is a true blessing that he is at SCH. - Dr Parihk is Exceptional! A Truly Brilliant Doctor AND Extraordinary Human Being is an uncommon and unexpected experience in the medical world. I was truly blessed to have Dr Parihk assigned to my Daughter RUBY. The knowledge, care & grace of this surgeon gave me the miracle that I had tearfully longed and prayed for. He performed 2 successful surgeries on Ruby and completely changed the lives of my entire family, not just his patient. Dr Parihk, thank you and bless you. I will never forget you & wish you were still in NY to know Ruby today. - Our 4 year old son just had his tonsils & adenoids out with Dr Parikh. He was incredibly patient & informative, but open to my thoughts as well. We made decisions together and it truly felt that he treats his patients as if they were his own. He's a wonderful physician who I would entrust to care for all of my children. Thank you Dr Parikh for helping our son Gavin to hopefully experience more quality sleep!! - Thinking about Dr. Parikh today about a year after our son's surgery. He was awesome and put us at ease during a stressful time. We were lucky to have such a great doctor! - Dr. Parikh is a man who was sent straight from GOD to heal chidren. He has the best bedside manner to the children and the families. He always make you feel like you a part of his personal family. He treated my daughter at Bronx Montifiore Medical Center with such care and compassion. He perfomed a tracheal reconstruction, he removed her tonsils and adnoids. He did an AMAZING JOB. We miss him, but my family was fortunate to have met him at the time we did because he saved my daughters life on numerous occassions and we will be forever grateful. He met us at a time when my daughter was a trach dependent child with no voice and a slim chance of ever speaking again, but Dr. Parikh changed our lives, she now a 13yr old who has a voice of her own. We thank you for your dedication and hard work. Keep up the amazing job and I would recommend Dr. Parikh 1000x over. - The best doctor I see he do surgery to my son in Montefiore Children Hospital in Bronx he give life to my son you the best - Our 6 week old had a very attached frenulom and couldn't latch for breastfeeding and struggled with bottle feeding. Dr. Parikh was so kind, gentle and understanding with our situation. He was extremely professional and was so good with our little guy. He is truly an amazing doctor and I would recommed him 100x over. - One of the Best Dr. in the Area. I Highly Recommend Him. He did tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy on my 7 year old last week. He came to meet us Before the surgery and explained us what he will be doing during surgery. As soon As Surgery was over He came to meet us , explained us what should we expect after this surgery with all Comforting Details and Suggestions. We were really Nervous but after talking to him we literally felt that wow we are in good hands. Unbelievably, my daughter is off pain killers in less then 5 days and back to school already. she is completely pain free. I really feel he is one of the best dr anyone can get. Thank you Dr. Parikh , just because of you my daughter is better today. - Our daughter was born in the spring of 2009 with a severe case of laryngomalacia. Her airway was 90% blocked, so she had extreme difficulty both swallowing and breathing. Through a referral, we found Dr. Parikh at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, NY. He was able to quickly diagnose the situation and perform surgery a few weeks later to clear her airway. During the whole time, he made sure to keep us informed. My wife and I are so thankful that we found Dr. Parikh when we did. We wish him the best in all his future endeavors. Thank you!! - Dr. Parikh is the best. He has saved by daughter, Shannon's life many times over. We will not forget. God Bless you Dr. Parikh. Good Luck and Best Wishes to you and your Family. - All I can say is Dr. Parikh is one of the reasons why my life has been changed forever. I will never forget him. Your health is in the absolute best hands if you get lucky enough to have him as your doctor! - My daughter was 17 and had years of nose/sinus issues and pain. The local doctor's we had seen wanted her to go to Pain Management and take prescription drugs for the rest of her life. This was not acceptable. We were referred to Dr. Parikh at Seattle Children's Hospital. Dr. Parikh was kind and took the time in listening to our story. He ordered several tests for our daughter and it was determined she needed surgery in order to open up her sinus passage ways and allow her to breath. He was also able to determine her pain issues and help to resolve them without a lifetime of prescription drugs. Our daughter had a challenging sinus and nose issues. Dr. Parikh operated on our daughter last week and her stints/stitches and cast came off yesterday. She can finally breath. Dr Parikh and his staff were kind and professional and always put our daughter's health issues first. He was thorough and we are very grateful for all his efforts. On a scale of 1 to 10, Dr. Parikh and the staff at Children's Hospital in Seattle receive a score of 100! Thanks so much! - Dr. Parikh is seriously one of the nicest and most competent doctors we have ever met. He was very friendly, reassured us that everything was going to be ok, and was very supportive throughout the entire process. Thank you Dr. Parikh for being such a great example of excellent service and knowledge to which all doctors should strive for! - Dr. Parikh will be performing surgery on my son next week and he is the only doctor that has made us feel comfortable with the surgery and that he can do it with ease! My son has had many medical issues in the past but Dr. Parikh assured us that him and his team would take good care of him. I will post another recommendation after his surgery if all goes well :) - When our son was born, my wife and I were sent to the Children's Hospital at Montefiore in the Bronx specifically to meet Dr. Parikh. Our son was born with an extremely complex syndrome that affected multiple systems in his body. Dr. Parikh immediately made us feel comfortable (as comfortable as we could be given our situation) by being so down to earth and compassionate. He performed multiple surgeries on our son including a tracheostomy, corrective surgery for bilateral choanal atresia, insertion of PE tubes, Partial tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, and eventual removal of his trach. Of all the surgeries, the choanal atresia repair stands out in my mind the most because it is such a difficult procedure with a very small success rate. There are very many stories of repeat surgery up to 12 times or more for the desired outcome. Dr. Parikh did it in one try. Also, removing my son's trach was nobody else's concern in the hospital because that was a quality of life issue rather than a health issue and, at that point, it didn't take precedence over everything else that was going on. Dr. Parikh, however, understood the quality of life issue, and was willing to push our son, within reason, to overcome this obstacle. It worked and we are and always will be eternally grateful for meeting him. He is immeasurably skilled, compassionate, and humble. Dr. Parikh, if you ever read this, just know that our son is doing great thanks in large part to you. He will grow up knowing your name and knowing what you did for him, and for us. Best of luck to you with your relocation and your new position. - When our 17 month old daughter was airlifted from Bellingham to Children's Hospital we were beside ourselves with fear. Our little Ella was diagnosed with a very large retropharyngeal abscess. Dr. Parikh was our daughters surgeon and he was absolutely amazing. He was very personable and made sure that we as parents were taken care of as well as our daughter. He listened to our concerns and when we thought that her condition looked worse he didn't hesitate to take her treatment to the next level. He even called our room on his day off to check on her! He performed a total of 3 surgeries on our little Ella and after 11 days at Children's we were able to bring her home where she has fully recovered. We can never say thank you enough to Dr. Parikh! - Dr.Parikhn have operated my grandchild with a fantastic result. My daughter received excellent information both before and after surgery. Our grandchild can for the first time in her six years of life breath without apna problems at night. Excellent surgeon he gets the highest recommendation! - We met DR. Parikh at the Montefiore childrens hospital in NY. He saved our son's Brandon's life. He was the only Doctor that was able to determine what my son had. I remember our first visit my son was only 6 weeks old and he said you guys are doing an amazing job because in reality this baby could of not survived this long. That was the day he began to save my son's life. My son's condition was complicated, but with Dr. Parikh's expertise he was able to perform surgery on my baby. I am proud to say Brandon will be 2 this July. Unfortunately he left our hospital to join the staff in this hospital. Our loss is your gain. Dr. Parikh is a great doctor. I trust him so much that if my son Brandon requires any further surgeries, I would fly to Seattle to see Dr. Parikh. - Dr. Parikh is amazing! He is an extremely skilled and experienced surgeon as well as a kind and friendly man. He offered us hope and reassurance when our son Rhys was diagnosed with a rare and dangerous condition. The level of Dr. Parikh's knowledge and experience with such a rare condition was impressive and comforting. He obviously cares very much about his patients and the family of his patients, making himself 100% accessible throughout our son's treatment before and after surgery. Rhys' surgery was a complete success and we are looking forward to our follow up appointments with Dr. Parikh over the coming year. - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date SEATTLE TOP DOCTOR - 2022 Seattle Magazine 2022 Seattle Top Doctor - 2019 Seattle Magazine 2019 SEATTLE'S TOP DOCTOR - 2018 Seattle Magazine 2018 SEATTLE'S TOP DOCTOR - 2017 Seattle Magazine 2017 Seattles Top Doctor 2016 Seattle Met Magazine 2016 SEATTLE'S TOP DOCTOR - 2016 Seattle Magazine 2016 SEATTLE MAGAZINE TOP DOCTOR - 2015 Seattle Magazine 2015 SEATTLE'S TOP DOCTOR - 2015 Seattle Met Magazine 2015 Seymour Cohen Research Award American Broncho-Esophagological Association 2014 Seattle Magazine Top Doctor - 2012 Seattle Magazine Top Doctor - 2012 Seattle Magazine 2012 U.S. News Top Doctor U.S. News and World Report 2012 Honor Award American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery 2011 William Potsic Basic Science Research Award American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology 2009 - Other Publications - Liu CC, Parikh SR, Horn DLDo Antivirals Congenital 32010980 The - Kirkham E, Ma CC, Filipek N, Horn DL, Johnson K, Chen ML, Parikh SRPolysomnography outcomes of sleep endoscopy-directed intervention in surgically na\u00c3\u00afve children at risk for persistent obstructive sleep apnea. 31919717 Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung, 2020 Jan 10 - Dahl JP, Propst EJ, Snoap A, Parikh SR, Inglis AF Jr, Cotton RT, Johnson KDevelopment of a Modern Pediatric Airway Reference Tool. 31886895 The Laryngoscope, 2019 Dec 30 - Miller C, Kirkham E, Ma CC, Filipek N, Horn DL, Johnson K, Chen ML, Parikh SRPolysomnography outcomes in children with small tonsils undergoing drug-induced sleep endoscopy-directed surgery. 30575040 The Laryngoscope, 2019 Dec. : 129(12)2771-2774 - Padia R, Coppess S, Horn DL, Parikh The Laryngoscope, Nov. : 129(11)2588-2593 - Wick EH, Johnson K, Demarre K, Faherty A, Parikh S, Horn DLReliability and Construct Validity of the Penetration-Aspiration Scale for Quantifying Pediatric Outcomes after Interarytenoid Augmentation. 31426703 Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, 2019 Nov. : 161(5)862-869 - Liu CC, Soares JJ, Elder L, Hill L, Abts M, Bonilla-Velez J, Dahl JP, Johnson KE, Ong T, Striegl AM, Whitlock K, Parikh SRSurveillance endoscopy after children: Findings and interventions. 31670383 The Laryngoscope, 2019 Oct 31 - Parisi MT, Khalatbari H, Parikh SR, Alazraki AInitial treatment of pediatric differentiated thyroid cancer: a review of the current risk-adaptive approach. 31620841 Pediatric radiology, 2019 Oct. : 49(11)1391-1403 - Coppess S, Padia R, Horn D, Parikh SR, Inglis A, Bly R, Dahl J, Dudley D, Johnson KStandardizing Laryngeal Cleft Evaluations: Reliability of the Interarytenoid Assessment Protocol. 30322357 Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, 2019 March : 160(3)533-539 - Parikh SR, Archer S, Ishman SL, Mitchell RBWhy Is There No Statement Regarding Partial Intracapsular Tonsillectomy (Tonsillotomy) in the New Guidelines? 30921527 Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, 2019 Feb. : 160(2)213-214 - Mitchell RB, Archer SM, Ishman SL, Rosenfeld RM, Coles S, Finestone SA, Friedman NR, Giordano T, Hildrew DM, Kim TW, Lloyd RM, Parikh SR, Shulman ST, Walner DL, Walsh SA, Nnacheta LCClinical Practice Guideline: Tonsillectomy in Children (Update). 30798778 Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, 2019 Feb. : 160(1_suppl)S1-S42 - Miller C, Parikh SRDoes supraglottoplasty improve outcomes in children with laryngomalacia? 30329149 The Laryngoscope, 2019 Feb. : 129(2)285-287 - Mitchell RB, Archer SM, Ishman SL, Rosenfeld RM, Coles S, Finestone SA, Friedman NR, Giordano T, Hildrew DM, Kim TW, Lloyd RM, Parikh SR, Shulman ST, Walner DL, Walsh SA, Nnacheta Guideline: Tonsillectomy in Children (Update)-Executive Summary. 30921525 Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, 2019 Feb. : 160(2)187-205 - Akkina SR, Ma CC, Kirkham EM, Horn DL, Chen ML, Parikh SRDoes drug induced sleep endoscopy-directed surgery improve polysomnography measures in children with Down Syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea? 30776267 Acta oto-laryngologica, 2018 neonatal fold immobility.
