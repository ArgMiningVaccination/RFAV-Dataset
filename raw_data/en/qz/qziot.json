Degree Requirements The curriculum of the UTCVM is a 9 -semester, 4 -year program. Each class begins in August and graduates 4 years later in May. T he first 5 semesters generally follow the traditional fall and spring sessions with the summer break following years 1 and 2. The final 4 semesters of the professional curriculum begin immediately following semester 5 and are continuous clinical rotation e xperiences extending over 68 weeks. Semesters 1 & 2: Development of a strong basic science foundation is emphasized in the first 2 semesters. Courses consist mostly of pre -clinical subjects of anatomy (gross and microscopic), physiology, immunology, bacter iology, virology, and parasitology. Also included in the first year are clinical subjects of physical diagnosis and normal radiology. Considerable integration of subject matter is incorporated during this year. Semesters 3 -5: The third through fifth semest ers include the study of diseases, their causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention . Courses are team -taught on an organ system basis. Semesters 6 -9: The final 4 semesters are devoted to intensive education in solving animal disease problems involving ex tensive clinical experience in the VMC. Each student will participate in clinical rotations in the VMC and in required externships (preferably off -campus), with options to participate in research and alternative career studies. Curriculum Features Innovati ve features of this curriculum include 3 weeks of student -centered, small group, applied learning exercises in semesters 1 through 4; three weeks of dedicated clinical experiences in the VMC in semesters 1 through 4; and elective course opportunities, in s emesters 2 through 9, which allow students to focus on individual educational/career goals. Students enrolled in the DVM program may register for up to 10 hours of graduate courses, and these hours will be credited toward DVM graduation requirements. Elect ive study offers a unique educational alternative for students in the UTCVM and is intended to enhance professional growth, concentration in an area of interest, and career opportunities. In addition to education in the science and art of veterinary medicine, students receive instruction in subjects such as student success and wellness, cultural competency, conflict management, medical communication, professional ethics, jurisprudence, economics, and practice management. Students in the 3rd year are require d to take a comprehensive examination prior to transitioning to clinical training. The exam is set by the International Council on Veterinary Assessment. The curriculum also requires demonstrated competency of a minimum of 200 clinical skills by the conclu sion of the 9th semester and successful completion of 153 credit hours, of which 62 will be completed within the final 4 semesters. During the clinical phase, s tudents are eligible to participate in approved externships ; externships are not granted prior t o this time. The number of credits a student may earn by completing an approved externship is generally 2- 6, but more in -depth content may necessitate lengthier externships. Students may accumulate 12 xternship credits toward graduation requirements . Avai lable externship sites may be 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 17 Licensure and Accreditation Examinations NAVLE In preparation for licensing in the field, the North American Veterinary Licensin g Examination (NAVLE) should be taken in the final year, during the winter (November -December) test window. Should candidates fail to successfully pass the examination at this time, a second opportunity is offered during a spring (April) window, in order t o be eligible to receive licensure to practice veterinary medicine. The practice of veterinary medicine is controlled by a central agency in each state. In Tennessee, it is the Tennessee Department of Health ( https://www.tn.gov/health/health -program -areas/health -professional - boards/veterinary -board/vet -board/licensure.html). Practice acts vary, but most states rely, at least in part, on results of the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination (NAVLE) to determine which applicants are qualified to practice in their state. For the 202 2/2023 academic year, fourth -year veterinary students are privileged to sit for the NAVLE ex amination during November -December 202 2 or in April 202 3.

Guidelines and Expectations for Instructors Atmosphere for Teaching and Learning It is important that the instructor create , from the beginning, and preserve an atmosphere conducive to learning. Both instructor and student should feel they have come together in the common cause of the pursuit of learning. Instructors should ensure their students are progressing through their co urse of study in a timely fashion. To preserve the trust and respect that are essential to the instructor- student relationship, instructors should not have an amorous or sexual relationship (consensual or otherwise) with a student who is enrolled in a cour se being taught by the instructor or whose academic or work performance is subject to supervision or evaluation by the instructor. Conducting a Course It is the instructor's responsibility to organize class material as efficiently and effectively as possible at the beginning of each term of instruction. At the beginning of the semester, course coordinators will distribute to students the syllabus (a template may be found here) that makes clear the basis of the final grade with regard to the value placed on each course component. All instructors should set an example for students by being faithful in attendance and punctual in starting and ending classes. Students should be inf ormed of all planned instructor absences or other changes as early as possible. Changes to the course schedule or syllabus should be minimal after the semester starts. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 41 In presenting course content, the instructor should endeavor at all times to adhere to h is or her subject; the classroom should not be used as a theater for expression of personal views that are not germane to the course. In addition, instructors should demonstrate professional behavior and avoid disparaging or exclusive language in the class room, laborator y, and clinical setting. Expected behavior of all UT employees falls under the UT Code of Conduct ( https://conduct.tennessee.edu/ ). The instructor should be reasonably available to students for questions and supplemental support to ensure learner success. Preferred contact times and methods during regular business hours should be communicated to students in the syllabus and reinforced in class. Timely Feedback Instructors should return all asse ssments as soon as possible and provide feedback to students so that assessments remain an educational instrument. Guidelines for Students Commitment to the Program The veterinary professional curriculum is a full- time program. Students are expected to fu lly participate in all curricular activities. Adequate Preparation With regard to learning, students have the responsibility to seek the information necessary to participate in classroom activity. Students must accept responsibility for adequate preparatio n for each class, arrive at all classes able and willing to interact through classroom participation, testing, writing, in -class exercises, and other methods used by the instructor. Basic to these activities is the need for students to employ appropriate r esources, as assigned by the instructor, such as textbooks, other supplies, and outside reading materials. Satisfying University Requirements It is the student 's responsibility to be aware of and follow guidelines, schedules, and deadlines provided by the DVM program, the UT Graduate School, the university, and its instructors. All responsibilities must be satisfied in a timely fashion. 3 + 1 Students It is the student's responsibility to request the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and the UTCVM Registr ar provide a letter of satisfactory completion of the 1st and 2nd terms in fulfillment of their 3 + 1 requirements for a bachelor's degree from Maryville College or the University of Tennessee. Code of Conduct A professional approach to learning, including prompt class attendance, attentive behavior during classes and laboratories, and respectful interpersonal interactions, is expected from students. Behavior associated with all examinations/assignments fall under the regulations of the University of Tennes see Student Code of Conduct . Basic In-Class Expectations Basic expectations of students include attendance, promptness, preparation, participation, professionalism, and respect. Much of the instruction that makes up the professional curriculum is conducted in UTCVM lecture halls and laboratories. It is the responsibility of the students to ensure that the environment for learning is as close to optimal as possible. Conduct that interferes with the opportunity of other students to hear or view a presentation cannot be tolerated. Instructors have the authority to remove offending students from the classroom or lab. Students ar e not permitted to bring personal pets or children into the lecture room theater or laboratory classroom. Professionalism Guidelines for Live Zoom Classes All instructors are encouraged to record lecture presentations using Panopto and to make them availab le in a timely fashion. Most standard recordings will be available within hours and make Zoom unnecessary . 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 42 For class meetings that are conducted via Zoom, t he UTCVM Curriculum Committee, with input from the faculty, has set guidelines to help ensure that all students and faculty have a great Zoom experience. This baseline guide includes information on technical preparation and logistical reminders and may be amended by course coordinators and instructors. Please review the full guidelines at this link: https://vetmed.tennessee.edu/wp -content/uploads/sites/4/Zoom -Professionalism -Guidelines.pdf . Laptop Requirement UTCVM requires a laptop for use in class and, most importantly, for computer -based asse ssments using a software called Examplify from ExamSoft.

The college recommends the use of anti -virus software on all laptops, but know that this software must be able to be quickly and easily disabled prior to each exam. Specific questions about laptop requirements may be addressed to Mr. Royal Paschall (royal@utk.edu ). Professional Dress Guidelines All members of the UTCVM community, including faculty, staff and students, are expected to uphold university, state, and applicable federal guidelines regarding appropriate and safe dress in the workplac e. Many dress guidelines are designed to protect you and the community from contaminants, health hazards, and potential disease outbreaks. Additionally, because the UTCVM buildings are public areas and subject to visits and tours from many clients and othe r visitors, your appearance reflects on the college, the university, and the veterinary profession. A positive professional image is vitally important for maintaining the public support and caseload needed for your position or your education. While respect ing a diversity of styles, opinions, and interpretations regarding dress, the following are guidelines for student, staff, and faculty dress in major areas of the college and Veterinary Medical Center. Please communicate with your peers, supervisor, or sup ervising instructor if you have questions or need clarification about these guidelines. More defined guidelines of professional dress for clinical experiences are available within each department . General Guidelines: I) Dress should always reflect a neat, cl ean, and professional appearance. Please be aware that professional dress may vary among individuals, but does not resemble the casual clothing you might wear at home or during recreational activities, or the fashionable or revealing clothing you may choos e for social settings. II) Visible identification of college personnel is important so that others can learn your name and so that unauthorized individuals in the building can be more readily recognized. NAME TAGS MUST BE WORN AT ALL TIMES. III) Coveralls, protecti ve boots, and laboratory coats must be removed before entering food preparation or eating areas, such as the P.O.D. IV) For public safety reasons and professional reputation, hospital attire (surgical scrubs, lab coats, large animal protective clothing, etc.) should not be worn outside the Veterinary Medical Center or Joe Johnson Research and Teaching Unit (JRTU) . V) Proper footwear (closed toe shoes that sufficiently protect the feet) should be worn in all hospital areas and laboratories where animals, animal tis sues, biohazards, or sharp objects are present. VI) Surgical attire is designed to protect the sterile environment of the operating suites. Within the sterile surgical area, scrubs are worn along with protective caps, masks, and shoe covers. Surgical 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 43 scrubs mu st be covered by a buttoned, full -length laboratory coat or coveralls at all times outside the operating suite, and are not considered proper attire for the classroom. Scrub tops that may be worn for technical work, large animal duties, or non -operating ro om procedures must be clearly distinguishable from surgical scrubs by color or pattern. VII) In addition to the specific guidelines given below, departments, diagnostic laboratories, and teaching laboratories may maintain and communicate additional clothing and footwear requirements for certain areas, classes, or teaching exercises. VIII) Specific areas: a) Diagnostic and Teaching Laboratories i) Gloves and laboratory coats are required in areas with biohazards or radioactive materials (includes anatomy and parasitology laboratories). ii) Splash goggles are required when a biohazard splash hazard is present. iii) Appropriate footwear should be worn in all laboratories. iv) Protective eyewear may be required in areas with laser hazards. b) Small Animal Clinical Sciences i) Required dress con sists of a c lean, white clinic jacket or lab coat over clean , neat clothes , such as a dress, slacks, skirt , and blouse or collared shirt .

Do not bring pens into the necropsy area. Prepared by the OEE and approved by Executive Committee, Fall 2006. Course & Rotation Information Canvas/Course Materials The university uses Canvas to store course materials such as lecture PowerPoints, videos, supplementary readings, assignment prompts, etc. Canvas is used to post student grades for assignments, exams, and quizzes, and it might be used by instructors to tak e attendance, receive assignment submissions, and/or for quizzes. Students are automatically added to Canvas courses via the UT registration process. All Canvas courses in which students have been enrolled will remain available to students until their Net ID is deactivated through the university 1 year after graduation. The UTCVM Canvas liaison is Mr. Royal Paschall. Lecture captures are linked by semester and course in VetNet at https://liveutk.sharepoint.com/sites/utcvm/students/SitePages/Lecture%20Captures.aspx . Assignments and Grading Grades are assigned only by course coordinators. It is their responsibility to assign a grade that reflects student performance on all assigned assessments: exams, laboratory exercises, reports, etc. Attendance and participation may be included as part of the assessment process. In certain courses, a portion of the grading process will be subjective. Students will be advis ed of the method and basis for the determination of this portion of the grade by the course instructor(s). Each coordinator is encouraged to set a standard of performance for the course and to grade in comparison to that standard . Grading and assessment policies should be clearly stated in the course syllabus. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 45 Number and types of exam ination s. Instructors must clearly state the number of examinations and the point distribution for each from the outset of the course. Instructors are free to choose the type of assessments that best fit their course and approach to teaching. The examination format should also be disclosed to students, i.e. multiple choice, short answer, and/or essay. Dates and times of examinations . Examination dates must be clearly communicated to students at the outset of the course and are typically coordinated through the Office of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. Communication regarding examinations will normally occur via e -mail, and students are responsi ble for checking their e -mail daily . Time allowed for examinations. Students normally will have two (2) hours to complete each examination. In general, exams are prepared to take 60 minutes, with an extra hour allotted so that everyone can complete the exa mination comfortably (exceptions to this policy may include practical examinations and quizzes). In accordance with Office of Student Disability Services (SDS) policies, students who require additional examination time based on the impact of a disability s hould contact SDS each semester to coordinate reasonable academic accommodations. It is the student's responsibility to verify that the instructor is aware of accommodation needs . Full testing accommodations , including extra time and/or individual, quiet s paces for exams, are provided through the UT SDS testing center (100 Dunford Hall, 915 Volunteer Blvd.). Certain accommodations may be available within the regular exam room of the UTCVM. In-person exam materials. Students may bring into the exam room only the following exam materials unless the faculty member has issued the exam as open -book or open -note: 1. Electronic Exams : Laptop, stylus, soft earplugs (headphones or ear buds will be allowed as detailed by the instructor if the exam includes sound or according to SDS accommodations), and a writing instrument. a. Students will receive one piece of scrap paper immediately befo re the exam and must write their name on and turn in all scrap paper upon leaving the exam room. Additional paper will be available if needed during the exam. b. Privacy screens are required to be used during electronic exams. c. Laptops must be closed and left in the exam room if a student leaves the room for any reason. d. Students must show confirmation that the exam has submitted before leaving the exam room. 2. Written Exams : Earplugs and a writing instrument. 3. Prohibited Items: a. Electronic devices , besides the one being used to take an exam in ExamSoft/Examplify, are prohibited (this includes, but is not limited to, multi- function calculators, noise canceling headphones [except as allowed by SDS accommodations], cell phones, smart watches, any device with a camera o r that connects to the Internet, etc.). b. Hats and hoods. Backpacks must be left at the front of the room or other secure location agreed upon by students and the instructor or exam proctor. Students should pick them up when leave the exam room. Off-site exams. Off-site/remote exams will be delivered via ExamSoft or Canvas. Faculty may elect to administer proctored/monitored exams using visual or other electronic proctoring . For all exams, students must comply with the proctoring protocol and the UT Honor Statement. Exam changes. Examinations are scheduled carefully to provide optimal opportunity for everyone and should not be changed except in extraordinary circumstances. If an examination change is desired, the class representative (Academic Chair) shoul d contact the instructor and course coordinator first and gain class agreement according to established class policy. Following this process, all exam changes must be forwarded to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs for approval. Classes are encouraged to review schedules prior to the semester start and request any exam scheduling adjustments prior to the start of class. Following the final publication of exam schedules and start of class, change of exam dates will be minimal. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 46 ExamSoft technology . Unles s they have specific accommodations that require an alternate format, all students are required to take didactic mid -term and final exams via ExamSoft assessment software (school name code: utcvm): https://ei.examsoft.com/GKWeb/login/utcvm . Make -up for missed exams. Should a personal emergency or illness arise causing a missed exam, the student must notify the course coordinator and the Office of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs (865- 974-7263 ) as soon as possible. The make -up examination should be scheduled with the course coordinator as soon as possible by submitting a leav e request . Other requests for a missed examination should be submitted to the course coordinator well in advance. The provision for a make -up examination will be determined by the principal instructor(s). If a make -up examination is provided, the final course grade will be determined by the principal instructor or instructors. Method for reporting in -progress grades. Grades will normally be posted through Canvas. Students may be notified by e -mail when grade posts are ready for viewing. Instructors will make every attemp t to have grades posted within a week of the examination. If not recorded in Canvas, faculty will report D and F grade student performance to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. Students with D or F grades on any assessment are encouraged to meet with the course coordinator or instructor to plan an in - course or post -course remediation and improvement strategy. Method for reporting pre-clinical final grades. Final grades will be available online according to UT policy. Final grades should follow the UT CVM Pre -Clinical Grading Scale. UTCVM Pre -Clinical Grading Quality Points 90-100% 4.0 88-89% B+ 3.5 C 2.0 60-69% D 1.0 <60% F 0.0 Numeric scores that fall between grade categories (e.g. 89.5%) may be mathematically rounded or stand without rounding. Faculty will designate their process for rounding and grading within the course syllabus. If the rounding process has not been stated, a standard mathematical rounding will be applied to the final scores. Courses and their evaluation should be structured so that the median course grade is not less than 80%. If the median grade falls below 80%, the scale may be adjusted so that the class median will be 80% with other points in t he scale adjusted accordingly. The scale will not be adjusted if the class median is above 80%. Satisfactory/no credit grading is used for those courses where the UT Graduate Catalog stipulates such a grade. Grade point averages are computed using only grades from letter- graded courses. Incomplete pre-clinical grades. In most circumstances, a make -up examination must be administered and graded so that the final grade for th e course can be reported within the period prescribed by the registrar for that term. However, instructors, at their discretion, have the prerogative of issuing a grade of Incomplete (\"I\") when circumstances , such as illness, warrant such action. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 47 A grade of incomplete must be removed satisfactorily from the student's record by the end of the first 5 academic days of the following semester; otherwise, a grade of \"F\" may be given. During extenuating circumstances, such as prolonged absences related to health or family emergencies, and at the discretion of the Associate Dean or Dean, satisfactory removal of \"I\" grades may be extended to completion within 1 calendar year of course en d. All \"I\" grades must be removed prior to graduation. To access the complete UTCVM Exam and Exam Security Policy Method of grading. Clinical grades are expected to be recorded in the online evaluation platform within 14 days of the end of a rotation and are entered into the UTK online grading system at the end of each semester (summer, fall, spring). Clinical grades types include: H Honors S Satisfactory N/C No Credit SI Satisfactory Incomplete Grading standards. Rotation objectives, expectations, and grading standards should be communicated in the rotation syllabus and orientation materials. In general, Honors grades are reserved for exceptional performances (e.g. the top 5 -10%). No quality points are awarded for clinical rotations, so clinical grades do not affect GPA calculations. In addition to the final clinical rotation grade, clinical performance is assessed using a competency assessment rubric and specific written comments. As in some preclinical courses, all or portions of the clinical grading process will be subjective. Students will be advised of the method and basis for the determination of this portion of the grade by the course instructor(s). In particular, students are expected to perform in a profess ional manner at all times. They will be evaluated on professionalism within the clinical grading rubric. An unsatisfactory mark for professionalism results in a grade of N/C for the entire rotation, irrespective of the performance in other areas . Unsatisfactory clinical grades. Students are required to satisfactorily complete each rotation. For rotations that use numerical grading, grades at or above 70% are considered Satisfactory . All students receiving an N/C for a rotation will come before the UTCVM Academic Progress Committee to develop plans for improvement and remediation. With the approval of the Committee and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, a student may repeat an S/NC rotation. Any student receiving an N/C for more than two rotati ons will be suspended for the remainder of the academic year. The Academic Progress Committee and Associate Dean for Academic Affairs will determine the criteria for readmission, if any. Any student receiving more than one \"low performance flag\" (unsatisfa ctory marks on the clinical assessment rubric) within a single rotation, or repeated across three or more rotations, will also undergo a performance review by the Academic Progress Committee. Incomplete Clinical Grades \"SI\" is a temporary grade indicating that the student has performed satisfactorily in the rotation, but due to unforeseen circumstances, such as absence or illness, has been unable to complete all the requirements. Temporary \"SI\" grades are also used at times when clinical rotations span acro ss more than one semester. All incompletes MUST be removed within 1 year. If a grade change has not been received in the UT Registrar's office at the end of the appropriate year, the \" SI\" will be changed to an \"N/C .\" No student may graduate with an \"SI\" on their record. If a student receives an \"SI,\" it is their responsibility to contact the instructor and find out what work remains to complete the rotation . 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 48 Pre-Clinical Attendance & Participation Within a p rofessional curriculum, the greatest value in the learning experience occurs when all students attend class and engage with the instructor in a shared learning experience . UTCVM policy does not mandate lecture attendance for all classes, but it is certainly expected. Each instructor is free to require mandatory lecture attendance as part of the grading process of their individual classes. Instructors will lecture capture course content, which can be reviewed by absent students or as a study aid. Students are always responsible for obtaining all material an d assignments from every scheduled curricular activity , whether they are present or not. Instructors have the option to administer unannounced examinations during lectures or laboratories. Instructors may also, at any time, assess and record individual student attendance or participation ; course grades for those students who are absent without legitimate reason may be reduced. Instructors may define a more specific attendance policy for their course as they deem appropriate, but they must inform students of this policy at the beginning of the course in the course syllabus . Attendance in laboratories and case discussions is required . Leave requests are required for any absence from a required activity. Students must attend their assigned sections and subsec tions. To avoid missing an individual laboratory session, a student may request attendance in an alternative section. They must first request permission of the instructor in charge of the laboratory prior to the scheduled time to make such a change . If a s tudent must miss a laboratory due to a n emergency or approved absence, the student must notify the instructor in charge of the laboratory and submit a leave request as soon as possible , preferably prior to the laboratory . A potential make -up date and time, or alternate activity, should be arranged with the instructor. Regrettably, most laboratories or case discussions cannot be made up except in the most extenuating circumstances . In some cases, where a laboratory cannot be made up, a grade reduction for mi ssed material may be applied. There are three categories of acceptable leave - the universal leave form is found in the appendix . Personal Excused Absences Excused absences are those absences that are unavoidable, such as the following: Health -related - Absence due to illness, essential doctor or other personal appointment, or care of immediate or close family member Funeral leave/bereavement - For an immediate or close family member; typically limited to 2 -3 days Religious observance - Absence due to r eligious holidays not scheduled by the university should be planned in advance with the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and instructor Professional Approved Leave Leave is normally approved for professional opportunities that are beneficial to the veterinary educational experience but occur during the academic or clinical semester. Students should request approval from the instructor and Assistant or Associate Dean, who will confirm the student is in good academic standing. Approved absences provide some protection for the student regarding faculty expectations; instructors are expected to be supportive within reason. The student is responsible for all course inform ation and any missed content. The instructor may choose not to provide extra time or materials to aid in make -up. Examples of professional opportunities include: Academic Activity - Examples of content that fall within the approved leave category include t ravel to meetings as an officer of SAVMA, college ambassador, or other official UTCVM officer, where the student will represent the college and/or student body during their attendance. Participation in college -endorsed educational programs, such as CDC Educational Day, Research Days, Legislative Fly -In, Quiz Bowls, Board of Advisor meetings, Day on the Hill, or similar events represent typical college -endorsed events. This leave category also includes students receiving awards or scholarships at ceremonies they must attend or those presenting a scientific paper or abstract. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 49 Continuing Education - Student -focused continuing education meetings are those that have strong student -centered content, laboratories, and educational agendas that complement the educat ional goals of special interest areas. Students with such interest may request leave, if done at least 30 days in advance. Job Interviews - Clinical students are provided 6 weeks of vacation and should make every effort to plan job searches and interviews during available vacation time. Because this is not always feasible, students may request 1 -3 days (inclusive of weekend duty) for job interviews during the clinical phase of the program. Students should request leave via the clinical rotation coordinator as soon as possible and at least 10 days in advance. Service requirements, patient care, and workload take precedence. Students should not make travel plans until they have confirmed approval from their rotation supervising clinician. Only one student may be gone on a given rotation at a time, and students are responsible for assuring all on -call and backup duty is covered. Students may be required to make up missed days or complete additional assignments and will receive an \"I\" grade until completed. Failure to complete required make -up or arrange appropriate back -up coverage will lead to an \"unsatisfactory\" grade in professionalism and no credit for the rotation. NAVLE - Each student is granted approved leave (2 days for students with approved accommodati ons) to take the NAVLE exam. Students must receive approval by submitting a leave request to the rotation coordinator in advance of confirming their testing date and location. Only one student may be absent from a rotation at a time unless explicitly appro ved by the rotation coordinator or supervising clinician. Other Personal Leave This leave is of minimal value to the veterinary educational experience, though it may have relevance (go to a dog show or the Equine Olympics) or may not have relevance to the curriculum (attend a wedding, run the Boston Marathon). Approval to miss clinic time without penalty or make up required lecture or laboratory attendance for personal leave is at the discretion of the instructor. Clinical Attendance & Participation Full participation in clinical assignments (Clinical Exposure and clinical rotations) is expected based on the schedule and work of the rotation. Scheduled hours and on -call hours may vary from day to day and week to week. Detailed information regarding th e clinical phase of the program is found in the clinical handbooks . Of note for all clinical students - students are expected to be within 20 minutes of the Veteri nary Medical Center during periods of on -call duty . Clinical absences In case of illness, the student must notify the attending clinician of the service early on the day of absence. An emergency absence is to be explained upon return to duty if it is not possible to do so at the onset of the emergency . No student is to leave duty or rotation assignments without notifying the attending clinician. All absences , including short appointments outside the VMC, require completion of a leave form . For compelling reasons, such as illness or personal reasons, the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, at their discretion, may permit a student to take a leave of absence, repeat, or reschedule a rotation. Clinical Rotation Block Changes With few exceptions, clinical rotations (including externships) start and end at 8 a. m. on Monday morning. If a rotation is scheduled to conclude on a holiday (Labor Day, Memorial Day, etc.), the rotation extends until Tuesday morning at 8 a .m. Note that students may have to request leave at the end of a VMC rotation or adjust the starting date of an externship to meet these expectations. Students are responsible for hospitalized patients or other assigned duties until that time. Students are NOT to be scheduled for overnight shifts or on -call responsibilities after midnight the day of a block change (i.e. Sunday night at midnight) in order to be fully prepared to attend the first day of their next rotation. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 50 Externship Attendance Students are expected to at tend and satisfactorily complete all externship responsibilities. Should a student miss a half or full externship day, the student may be issued an incomplete grade and be asked to return to the externship to complete the missed clinical education; supervi sing clinicians have the flexibility to issue a grade to these students should they feel the student has demonstrated acceptable clinical competence. In some instances, supplementary assignments may be recommended, again at the discretion of the supervisin g clinician. Students who miss multiple days during an externship may receive an incomplete grade, depending on externship length; the externship grade and university credit will not be issued until the student has satisfactorily completed the equivalent t ime missed. Students are to complete leave forms for any missed time on externships. As with internal leave forms, the form should be signed by the externship supervising veterinarian and forwarded to the Office of Academic and Student Affairs. Students should not schedule non -essential leave (i.e., vacation, CE, personal events) during externships. For specific information about externship expectations, see https://vetmed.tennessee.edu/wp -content/uploads/sites/4/Externship_Packet.pdf . Evaluation of Courses and Instruction All students are expected to provide evaluations for courses and instructors. Student evaluation of courses and ins truction provides basic information that is used for three different functions: First, and foremost, feedback to the instructors assists them to better meet student needs. Just as exams provide necessary feedback in determining student progress and the suc cess of instruction, student feedback assists in tailoring the course and instruction. Secondly, the faculty use s evaluations to monitor the curriculum. Students have a unique perspective in that they proceed through the whole professional curriculum. This input about content and coverage is often the only input on a course, independent of the instructors. Thus, it is an important and valuable form of feedback. Student input is often the stimulus for further review of a course or semester by the UTCVM Curri culum Committee. The third use of the evaluations is in consideration of faculty promotion, tenure, and salary decisions. Faculty evaluation is primarily the responsibility of the department head and peer review teaching committees, but student participation in an evaluation has considerable impact. Evaluations that represent the opinions of a mature class of students can be very influential. Failure of students to take their part in the process seriously reduces the impact of these evaluations on advancement considerations. Evaluation of Didactic Teaching. Each instructor involved in didactic teaching is evaluated by the students in the course if his or her involvement includes at least 4 contact hours. Evaluations are requested near the end of t he course. The following points are addressed by the evaluation, and individual instructor scores and mean scores for all faculty teaching in that year are made available. Possible student responses to each statement range from strongly disagree to strongl y agree. 1. This instructor seems concerned with facilitating my learning. 2. Lectures/labs, etc. conducted by this instructor (regardless of course) were organized and had clear objectives. 3. This instructor was willing to discuss course material with me outside of class time. 4. This instructor encouraged interaction and answered student questions during class meetings. 5. Any teaching aids (handouts, visual materials, demonstrations, illustrations) used by this instructor were helpful and relevant to me in learning th e subject matter. 6. Major concepts were emphasized during classroom presentations. 7. I was clearly informed by this instructor on how I would be evaluated (tested/graded). 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 51 8. The instructor covered material in this course at a pace that was reasonable for me. 9. Directions for course assignments by this instructor were clear and specific. 10. My overall opinion of this individual's teaching s kills is (range of poor to excellent) Evaluation of Clinical Teaching. For each rotation, students are expected to evaluate the clinical faculty member or members with whom there was major clinical involvement. The evaluation questions are listed below. The mean scores for all faculty teaching in the clinical year are made available, and possible student responses to each statement range from strongly disagree to strongly agree. 1. I was clearly informed by this instructor on how I would be graded. 2. The instructor actively involved me in rotation activities and case management. 3. The instructor challenged me to solve problems and to explain my decisions. 4. The instructor effectively explained diagnostic and treatment plan options . 5. The instructor was professional and respectful with patients, students, staff, clients and others. 6. The instructor provided timely feedback to me regarding my perfo rmance. 7. The instructor provided regular case or topic rounds, or equivalent instructional interactions during this rotation. 8. Overall, this instructor is an effective clinical teach er. Again, students are asked to comment on each clinical instructor's qualities or teaching skills that contributed to or hindered the success of the student in the clinics. In addition, comments are requested to determine the students' overall opinions regarding their clinical experience. Students are encouraged to take this res ponsibility of evaluation seriously and to consistently give it their best effort. Only with complete participation can the evaluations have the impact necessary to bring about improvements. Comments should be constructive, actionable, and professional. Pe rsonal attacks are violations of the professionalism code. Academic Honesty and Student Conduct Code Academic Honesty Each student is responsible for their own personal integrity in academic life. Although there is no affirmative duty to report the academ ic dishonesty of another, each student, given the dictates of their own conscience, may choose to report any violation of the Honor Statement. A reporting form exists here: https://liveutk.sharepoint.com/sites/utcvm/students/SitePages/Academic%20Honesty%20Report%20F orm.aspx . The following Honor Statement must be signed by each student upon entry to veterinary school and upon entering the clinical phase of the program . \"An essential feature of The University of Tennessee is a commitment to maintaining an atmosphere of intellectual integrity and academic honesty. As a student of the University, I pledge that I will neither knowingly give nor receive any inappropriate assistance in academic work, thus affirming my own personal commitment to honor and integrity.\" Violations of Academic Honesty Students are prohibited from engaging in the following types of misconduct: c heating, plagiarism, or an y other act of academic dishonesty, including, without limitation, an act in violation of the Honor 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 52 Statement. Violations of academic honesty are a serious breach in academic integrity. Plagiarism is using the intellectual property or product of someone el se without giving proper credit. Furnishing false information to the university is also conside red a breach of academic conduct . While collaboration between students in ABLEs is encouraged and expected, the written work produced by students (notes, papers , problem lists, reflective journals, etc.) is each individual student's work. These written materials should not be shared with students in earlier years of the professional curriculum. Sharing of written information with students in the earlier years of the curriculum is considered academic cheating or plagiarism and is a breach of the u niversity's honor code. In the event of an allegation of academic dishonesty , an instructor and/or the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs will notify the student of the a llegation, describe information supporting the allegation, and give the student an opportunity to respond within 5 business days of written notice/transmittal of the decision to the student . The instructor may impose an academic penalty, such as a failing or reduced grade on an examination or in a course, or an assignment to repeat the work. Misconduct Appeals : Students with g rievances should first seek resolution at the instructor, department, and college levels. At a minimum, the student must first confe r with the appropriate faculty member, advisor, the department head , and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs . Further appeals related to decisions of student conduct or professionalism (e.g., professional probation, misconduct, cheating, etc.) may be m ade to the D ean of the UT CVM within 5 business days of written notice transmittal . With an allegation of academic dishonesty that the student believes was not satisfactorily resolved within the UTCVM , students have the right to appeal by submitting a written Notice of Appeal of Academic Penalty within 5 business days to the UT Knoxville Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards (SCCS) using a form provided by SCCS. Students also have a right to be assisted by an advisor throughout the student c onduct process. Resolutions are usually achieved by either 1) signing a resolution agreement or 2) having a formal hearing before the Student Conduct Board . For complete information and a complete list of conduct violations, visit http://hilltopics.utk.edu/ and https://studentconduct.utk.edu . Full appeal procedures in regard to allegations of misconduct or academic dishonesty are presented in Hilltopics under \" Student Code of Conduct\" at https://hilltopics.utk.edu/student -code -of-conduct/ . Misconduct appeals should be directed to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards, 4 05 Student Servic es Building. Students with grievances related to race, sex, color, religion, national origin, age, disability , sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, parental status, genetic information, or protected veteran status should file a formal complaint with the Office of Equity and Diversity, 1840 Melrose Avenue. Per Board of Trustees bylaws, Article V, Section 5, \"Any employee or student of the University who feels that he or she may have a grievance against the University shall have the righ t of appeal through the appropriate Chancellor or Vice President to the President of the University, except as otherwise provided by University policy.\" In the case of UT students, they may appeal the decision of the Dean of the Graduate School to the Prov ost, and then the UT Knoxville Chancellor. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 53 Academic Standards Policy Academic evaluation of students is not based solely upon examination grades but is also a matter of continuing objective and subjective evaluation of student academic performance and/or p rogress. Satisfactory clinical performance and adherence to standards of professional conduct are required of each student in the UTCVM, regardless of cumulative grade point average. These factors are considered in the evaluation of each student and will be critical in determining the student's continuation in the professional curriculum. Subjective Grading In certain courses, a portion of the grading process will be subjective. Students will be advised of the method and basis for the determination of this portion of the grade by the course instructor(s). Clinical rotations are graded by performance rubrics ( https://vetmed.tennessee.edu/academics/curriculum -and- assessment/ ). Evaluation of skills performance is by observation of competency within medical standards of care. A skills log is used to record successfully performed skills. A minimum of 200 total and 110 core skills are required for graduation. Academic Progress Satisf actory completion of the professional curriculum requires a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or greater, completion of the minimum required skills, and a passing score on the Veterinary Educational Assessment (VEA) exam ination or exam remediation appr oved by the Academic Progress Committee. All three of these requirements must be completed in order to receive the DVM degree. Expectations for Progress. Students are considered in \"good academic standing\" if both the most recent semester and cumulative DV M program GPAs are 2.0 or above. Similarly, students are normally advanced in the curriculum if the most recent semester and cumulative GPA are 2.0 or above and no final grades fall below C. In this professional program, however, mastery of content and ski lls is paramount to build a foundational and growing body of knowledge to achieve the goals of the program and to succeed in clinical endeavors and on licensing examinations, so students should strive for an academic performance well above the minimum. Professionalism. Academic evaluation of students is not based solely upon examination grades but is also a matter of continuing , objective and subjective evaluation of student professional conduct. Adherence to standards of professional conduct are required of each student in the UTCVM, regardless of cumulative GPA. These factors are considered in the evaluation of each student and will be critical in determining the student's continuation in the professional curriculum. Expectations for professionalism are d escribed elsewhere in this handbook. For complete information and a complete list of conduct violations, visit http://hilltopics.utk.edu/ and https://studentconduct.utk.edu . Academic Progress Reviews. The Academic Progress Committee review s student standing if any one or more of the following occurs. 1. A student's cumulative grade point average, or grade point average for any academic semester, f alls below a 2.0. 2. A student fails a course or receives a grade of \"D\" in a course. 3. A student demonstrates unsatisfactory clinical performance , as evidenced by an NC grade, more than one \"low performance flag\" (un satisfactory marks within the clinical compe tency rubric ) within a single rotation or low performance flags repeated across three (3) or more rotations. 4. A student fails to adhere to the standards of professional conduct. 5. A student fails to pass the VEA examination after two attempts. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 54 The UTCVM Acade mic Progress Committee, composed of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, the committee chair, and at least one faculty member each from the three departments in the college, will interview and evaluate each student whose performance and/or progress is below the minimum acceptable level. Normally, the meeting will occur within 3 weeks of the last final examination of the semester (excluding holidays). The student will be asked to prepare a written narrative response prior to the meeting, including reflec tion on their progress and challenges, along with plans for improvement. The responsible instructor or instructors will be contacted by the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs , and all pertinent information - including the student's academic history, all examination grades for the semester ( pre-clinical students ), and all prior evaluations ( clinical students )-will be presented to and evaluated by the committee. After reviewing this information, the committee will determine appropriate action based on majority vote and academic guidelines . The committee chair will communicate the committee's decision in writing to the student with copies to the Dean and Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. Such action may includ e remediation and re -examination ; require ment that a course(s), term(s), or year(s) be repeated; suspension; dismissal with ability to reapply; permanent dismissal; or other appropriate measure(s). Reviews by the committee are holistic in nature and highly individualized. Normally, students with a D or F grade in a core course and a low semester or cumulative GPA, and students accumulating more than two D grades in the pre -clinical curriculum, will be advised to repeat semester content. In other circumstan ces of D grades, remediation and retesting, or advancement without retesting, may be recommended. Committee recommendations of an academic plan, actions, or resource acquisition to promote academic success will be provided to the student in writing , usuall y within 10 calendar days of the meeting . Such actions will be defined as mandatory or as recommendations. It is the student's responsibility to complete or seek assistance in meeting the ascribed recommendations or actions outlined by the Academic Progres s Committee. Failure to meet academic standards or the written requirements outlined by the Academic Progress Committee may result in academic probation, suspension, or dismissal from the UTCVM professional program. Academic Probation Academic probation is an indicator of academic standing that designates performance short of college expectations. Continued deficiencies during a probationary semester are likely to result in suspension or dismissal. Under academic probation, students must stay in regular con tact with their advisor and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, relinquish officer positions in class leadership and student organizations, and review commitments to other extracurricular activities with the Associate Dean. Existing and new scholarships (not financial aid) also may be impacted. Students placed on academic probation must maintain satisfactory academic performance in the subsequent semester of study. Satisfactory academic performance in this circumstance is usually defined as a semester GPA between 2.0 -2.5 with no grades below a C. Students on academic probation who are repeating semester course content will be expected to achieve a semester GPA of 2.5 with no grades below a C. Students will remain on Academic Probation at any time their cumulative GPA is less than 2.0 or as determined by the Academic Progress Committee. Probationary status for more than two semesters of the program may result in suspension or dismissal. Professional Probation Professional probation is an indicator of one or more documented incidents where student behavior has fallen short of the college or university expectations for professional conduct. Review of these incidents is also under the purview of the Academic Progress Committee and will be conducted as described for academic reviews above. The committee may recommend additional written reflections, targeted training or remediation, suspension or dismissal. Other penalties may be assigned by the university , as described in university documents ( http://hilltopics.utk.edu/ and https://studentconduct.utk.edu .) Academic Suspension Suspension is a temporary pause or deceleration of a student's progress. Suspension may be for a defined period (e.g. one semester or one calendar year) or indefinite period of time (until key readmission criteria have been met). The suspended student is withdrawn from the UTCVM for the period outlined by the Academic Progress Committee. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 55 Readmission requires the student to demonstrate readiness for successful completion of the professional program and completion of actionable plans outlined by the committee. Students must submit a letter of request for readmission. The letter should outline compliance with Academic Progress C ommittee recommendations or describe actions taken to achieve academic success. The letter should be received by the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs before a specified date, normally 90 days prior to the expected return date . Upon approval by the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and/or Academic Progress Committee, a readmission form will be provided by the college registrar and must be completed for readmission to proceed. Academic Dismissal Academic dismissal is the result of a pattern of receiving grades that are below the university's standards for good academic standing. Students who have been academically dismissed are not eligible to enroll in UTCVM classes, either full- time or part -time, are not permitted to live in university housing, and no longer have privileges provided through the UT VolCard. The decision of dismissal means that the student is withdrawn from the UTCVM and may not apply for readmission with advanced standing. Dismissed students will be given one of two options on readmission based on their academic and professional performance. The options for post -dismissal reapplication will be outlined in the dismissal letter as follows: 1) no option for readmission, or 2) readmission by competitive process thr ough the VMCAS application service. Eligibility for a change of status to register in another area of study within the university will be evaluated by the Dean of the Graduate School at the request of the student. Academic Appeals In general, s tudents with academic grievances should first seek resolution at the instructor and course coordinator level, communicating clearly and professionally their reasons for concern about examination, course, or other assessment results. Additional internal lev els of appeal include the department and college levels. At a minimum, the student must confer with the appropriate faculty member, advisor, the relevant department head , and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs prior to college or university appeal . If resolution at this stage is unsatisfactory, f urther appeal may be made to the D ean of the College of Veterinary Medicine , the Graduate Council Appeals Committee through the Assistant Dean of the Graduate School, and ultimately to the Dean of the Graduate School (see sections below) . Appeals of Academic Progress Decisions : The decision of the Academic Progress C ommittee may be appealed in writing within five (5) business days of written notice of the decision. The initial appeal may be made to the Academic Progress Committee if the student can show new information that is material to the original decision. If new information is not the basis for the appeal or the grievance concerns the interpretation of and adherence to college or university policie s and procedures , appeals may be made in writing to the Dean of the UTCVM , within 14 business days , but no later than 30 days , of the written notice transmittal . Such appeals include issues of academic policy, procedures, or grading (e.g. academic probation, suspension, or dismissal). Students may further appeal decisions by the Dean with the Graduate Council Appeals Committee (http://gradschool.utk.edu/faculty -staff/graduate - council/appeals -committee/ ). University Appeals: The Graduate Council Pr ocedure can be obtained at the university Graduate School or at https://gradscho ol.utk.edu/documents/2016/02/student -appeals -procedures.pdf/ . Appeals may involve the interpretation of and adherence to university, college, and department policies and procedures as they apply to graduate education and the issuance of grades based on spe cific allowable reasons stipulated in the Graduate Council Appeal Procedure . Appeals of a cademic penalties must be placed within thirty (30) days after the final grade has been issued . Appeals of policies or procedures must be placed within thirty (30) days after the UTCVM Dean's decision. Per Board of Trustees bylaws, Article V, Section 5, \"Any employee or student of the University who feels that he or she may hav e a grievance against the University shall have the right of appeal through the appropriate Chancellor or Vice President to the President of the University, except as otherwise provided by University policy.\" In the case of UT students, they may appeal the decision of the Dean of the Graduate School to the Provost and then the UT Knoxville Chancellor. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 56 Academic Withdrawal Students may withdraw from the professional curriculum before the term has ended for academic, health, or personal reasons. Students shou ld consult with the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs to aid in the withdrawal process. Students wh o withdraw and are in good academic standing may be readmitted at the discretion of the A ssociate Dean. The process for withdrawal is defined by UTK . Stude nts should consult Graduate Catalog (http://tiny.utk.edu/grad -catalog ), which describe withdrawal procedure s, academ ic dismissal, and suspension, including appeal. A portion of tuition may be refunded, based on the date of withdrawal, and any refund due is issued by the Bursar's Office. Students who withdraw from the professional program are asked to declare their withdrawal in writing to the Office of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. Instructions and/or reenrollment terms will be provided in writing upon receipt of the letter. Failure to atte nd classes for the remainder of a term, without filing for withdrawal, results in automatic F or NC grade in each affected class. Advance d Placement and Transfer of Students to UTCVM Acceptance into the UTCVM is a highly competitive process. The UT CVM has made a 4 -year commitment to those students who have been offered admittance, and a mutual commitment by the student is similarly expected. Because our professional curriculum is developed as sequentially - dependent content, the ability to accept advanced pl acement students is limited. As such, the transfer or advance placement of qualified veterinary student applicants from (or to) AVMA -accredited institutions will be considered on a very limited bas is. When exceptional factors support consideration of a tra nsfer or advanced placement, the following policy applies: Applicants to the UTCVM may be considered for entry to begin in semester 2 or semester 3 of the professional program only. Applications must be from ind ividuals who are attending AVMA -accredited U.S. or foreign veterinary medical colleges and who have equivalent curricular and veterinary medical backgrounds . Priority will be given to applicants who are residents of Tennessee. Applicants will initially be evaluated by the A dmissions Committee. Transc ripts of undergraduate and professional education will be reviewed , as well as supporting letters from the dean and associate dean from the primary (transferring) institution. Additional evaluation to aid placement may consist of examinations (written , oral, practical, or any combination thereof). The Admission s Committee will p rovide a recommendation to the Dean of the UTCVM . The Dean and Associate Dean for Academic Affairs will determine course selection and approve any and all transfer credit. Transf er from the UTCVM Students wishing to transfer from the UTCVM to another institution should discuss their need with the Associate Dean f or Academic Affairs. T he college does not generally support transfers except for extraordinary need, as these positions are not easily replaced and have denied educational access to another qualified candidate. Sh ould the need be approved, the Dean and Associate D ean will assist the student in contacting the target institution and providing supporting letters of good standi ng and any additional information needed by the transferring institution. Should the petition to transfer not be approved, the student retains their right to withdraw from the UTCVM . The y may continue to seek transfer to other veterinary medical institutio ns, and all transcripts will be sent via the UTK Registrar's Office. They will not, however , receive a letter of support from the UTCVM Office of the Dean. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 57 Student Services Financial Support Loans Eighty -five percent of UTCVM students received some form of federal financial aid during the 20 21-2022 academic year . The UT Financial Aid Office offers information on federal and private student loans (http://onestop.utk.edu/loans/ ). In addition, the UTCVM provides on -site financial aid review and oversite specific to veterinary professional students through the Office of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs . Students applying for financial aid must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) eac h academic year (an academic year is defined as consecutive fall, spring, and summer) before any financial aid award can be confirmed. The primary source of financial aid for veterinary students is Federal Direct Stafford Loans (subsidized/unsubsidized). Depending on a student's financial aid analysis, they may be eligible to receive Direct Unsubsidized and/or Direct PLUS loans. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are available to students (with or without demonstrated financial need) who have completed the FAFSA. While these loans are not need -based, they are budget -based, and students will not be eligible to borrow more than their budget. The current fixed interes t rate for the Direct Unsubsidized Loan is 6 .54%, and th ese loans begin accruing interest immediately. The interest on these loans may be paid while enrolled in school or may be added to the loan principal when it goes into repayment ( 6 months after gradua tion). NOTE: On April 6, 2022, the U.S. Department of Education extended COVID -19 emergency relief for student loans through August 31, 2022. This includes a 0% interest rate. Direct PLUS Loans are available to students (with or without demonstrated financ ial need) who have completed the FAFSA. These loans are designed to assist students to reach their budget if they have not done so with scholarships or unsubsidized loans. These loans carry a credit base , and students will need to appl y for them directly through the U.S. Department of Education . These loans have a current fixed interest rate of 7 .54%. NOTE: On April 6, 2022, the U.S. Department of Education extended COVID -19 emergency relief for student loans through August 31, 2022. This includes a 0% interest rate. Tuition rates are set by the UT Board of Trustees each June. Students should plan for a 3 -5% tuition increase each year. Excess funds for the f all 20 22 semester for students who h ave set up direct deposit will be sent to their banking institutions in late August. Students should allow 3 -5 business days for the funds to appear in their accounts. Students are strongly encourage d to set up direct deposit. For students not choosing direct deposit, checks will be mailed after the direct deposits have been processed. Loan fees (1.0 57% for Unsubsidized and 4.2 28% for Direct PLUS) will be subtracted from financial aid funds ; fees are t aken out of the loans first. Should you have questions pertaining to these loans, contact http://onestop.utk.edu/loans/ . Scholarships UTCVM scholarships are awarded early in fall semester and thereafter distributed between fall and spring semesters. Although m any UTCVM scholarships are awarded to students in the clinical year , nearly 50% of all students receive a scholarship award. Scholarship awards are based on academic excellence, financial need , and interest area . All students will be asked to complete a scholarship profile before the start of each academic year in order to best identify scholarship opportunities . Federal regulations require the UTCVM to not ify the Financial Aid Office of scholarships. Scholarships are calculated into total financial aid awards for the year and can affect the amount of other funding you may receive. Student Emergency Aid Fund (SEAF) The UTCVM SEAF fund is established through contributions provided for this specific purpose and will apply only to UTCVM students who experience emergency situations for which funds are not otherwise immediately available. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 58 Limits : A maximum of $500.00 may be borrowed from the fund. Reimbursement : Students are expected to repay the amount borrowed as soon as they are able, but no later than prior to graduation or departure from the UTCVM. Specific arrangements to repay the loan following graduation must be approved by the Asso ciate Dean and Financial Aid Office in advance. Loan Interest : No interest will be charged. However, in order to perpetuate the program and keep the SEAF solvent, it is expected that loan beneficiaries will wish to contribute to the fund in excess of the amount borrowed. Procedure : Any student in several financial need should present his or her request to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, who is empowered to render a decision and have issued immediately a draft not to exceed $500.00. Financial Aid : Federal regulations require the UTCVM to notify the Financial Aid Office of emergency loans. Emergency loans are calculated into total financial aid awards for the year and can affect the amount of funding you may receive. Registration Registration is required of all students when using university facilities. Registration allows use of services such as library checkout, laboratories, and recreation facilities not open to the public. Information concerning registration is available through Self -Service Banner via My UTK (http://myutk.utk.edu ) each term. Registration is accomplished for all veterinary students through the Office of the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs. Any veterinary student, including those who are dual enrolled in graduate programs (i.e. DVM/MPH , DVM/MS or DVM/PHD programs) should consult with the UTCVM Registrar to assure proper assignment of courses and course credits toward the correct degree. Payment of Registration Fees During priority registration, a statement is e -mailed to the registrant. Payment is due by the deadline noted on the bill. Additional information may be obtained from the Office of the University Registrar at 865- 974-2101 or http://registrar.utk.edu/ and at the Bursar's Office at 865 -974-4495 or http://bursar.utk.edu. Failure to pay registration fees before the deadline, as noted each semester on the billing statement, will result in cancellation of the schedule. Retroactive registration is not allowed. More information on tuition costs can be found at http://onestop.utk.edu/your -money/tuition -fees/ . Tuition is base d on initial residency classification as either in -state or out- of-state. Residency guidelines are determined by state law and are restrictive. Complete information can be gained from the Registrar's Office or this website http://registrar.utk.edu/residency/residency.shtml . In summary, the classification adheres to the following non -residency guidelines: if you depend on out -of-state parents/guardians for suppo rt if out -of-state parents/guardians claim you as a dependent on a tax return if you are attending school in Tennessee only for the purpose of schooling if you entered UT as an out -of-state, full -time student Where status is unclear, students should discu ss their status with the UTCVM Registrar. A process of second and third appeals exists in controversial cases. A ctive duty members of the U.S. Armed Forces and U.S. Armed Forces veterans are eligible for in -state tuition. More information is available thr ough the UTCVM Residency Classifier: College of Veterinary Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 59 Accommodations for Disabilities The UT Office of Stu dent Disability Services (865- 974-6087; http://sds.utk.edu/ ) provides appropriate accommodations and assists all students who anticipate or experience an educational barrier due to a hearing, vision, or neurological disability; a learning or attention -related disability; and/or a physical or mental health condition . The Office of Student Disability Services (SDS) is the designated office that obtains and files disability -related documents, certifies eligibility for servic es, determines reasonable accommodations, and develops plans for the provision of such accommodations. It is the student's responsibility to request in advance any individual assistance and to verify that the instructor is aware of accommodation needs. Accommodations may be course - or rotation -specific and will be provided as described by SDS. Full testing accommodations are provided through the UT Student Disability Services testing center (SDS, 100 Dunford Hall, 915 Volunteer Blvd.). Certain accommodation s may be available within the regular exam room of the UTCVM. Students should discuss with their instructor which accommodations might be available (e.g., reading software, noise -canceling headphones, etc.). If the regular exam room does not meet specific needs, students should take the exam at SDS and should sign up for an exam time online through the Student Portal at https://sds.utk.edu/student -portal -instructions/ at least 7 days in advance of the exam. Students who require additional time , a written exam , or individual, quiet space must take their exams at the SDS testing center. Students with short -term disability needs (such as a broken arm) may seek the advice of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and/or the guidance of SDS for appropriate documentation and approval of temporary accommodations. Faculty /Student Advising Program Each incoming veterinary student is assigned to a faculty advisor. Faculty and incoming students are expected to meet/connect three times during the first semester. Early on, advising is intended to be primarily academic. However, depending on the rapport established, some students consult with their faculty advisor for non -academic r easons, as well. Advisement may entail selection and supervision of the senior electives, career choices, etc. The Office of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and the Veterinary Social Work program are also available to all veterinary students for co unseling on academic, financial, or personal problems. When appropriate, referral can be made to other on -campus or off- campus resources, such as marriage counselors, mental health clinics, etc. Student Life Career Counseling Students may receive career c ounseling at four different levels: UTCVM Advisor: Faculty advisors are available to assist students with long -term career goals. See Faculty Advising Program . UT Center for Career Development: Jenny Ward , Senior Assistant Director, and Alexis Andershock, Career Coach, provide and arrange formal career services, such as resume review, mock interviews, job searches, etc. Alexis offers on -site UTCVM hours on a limited basis. For a full list of services, visit http://career.utk.edu/# . UTCVM Career Center: This Web site allows students to apply for jobs, offers tools for resume writing, and maintains a list of for -hire career coaches and o pen job positions. Visit http://careers.vet.utk.edu/ . Individualized Career Coaching is available with the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 60 UT's Pendergrass Library also maintains an employment resources gui de: http://libguides.utk.edu/c.php?g=188636&p=1246634 . Internships/Residencies : Students interested in pursuing an internship or residency for post -DVM clinical education should visit https://www.virmp.org/ , the Veterinary Internship & Residency Matching Program. Internships are 1 -year programs, typically offering veterinarians broad -based clinical exposure to areas that include surgery, medicine, radiology, emergency medicine, intensive care, ambulatory services, theriogenology , and anesthesia. Residents participate in a 3 -year program, specializing in a particular clinical area. Veterinary Social Work VSW seeks to understand and provide social work services at the intersection of veterinary and social work practice. We operate under the guidelines of the NAS W Code of Ethics . Moreover , our team has our own set of values and guidelines. These include , but are not limited to, respecting self -determination, taking a strengths -based perspective, reflecting, standing for social justice, taking personal responsibility for mental health and wellbeing, laughing, playing, apologizing when needed, being flexible and forgiving ; being available, adaptable, and here for you ; and doing our daily best to assume good intentions. Veterinary Social Work (VSW) provides time -limited counseling services for enrolled UTCVM veterinary medical students. These services are designed to help students address personal and psychological difficulties that may otherwise interfere with their academic, social, or psychological well- being. Servi ces include individual, couple, and group psychotherapy, as well as a range of workshops and programs. Each veterinary student receives 10 free sessions per academic year (fall/spring semesters ) and unlimited attendance at workshops, programs, and groups. VSW may provide more sessions on a case - by-case basis. VSW exists to support veterinary students while they develop the skills necessary to engage in required self -care for being a successful veterinary medical professional. Procedures VSW counseling sessi ons are kept confidential according to the guidelines set forth in Title 33 of the Tennessee legislative code. If they wish, students may sign a release of information to share information with selected individuals within and outside the college. The VSW t eam uses an electronic health record (EHR) for all documentation, scheduling of appointments, and releases for communication. This EHR is u sed by the VSW team outside of the UTCVM servers. Our EHR also allows us to offer secure chat and Zoom web meetings t o offer tele -behavioral health. VSW seeks to provide evidence -based practice; therefore, students seeking services may be asked to complete assessment tools so the efficacy of the treatment approach can be monitored by the student and the social worker. Al though we hesitate to become involved in disciplinary matters for veterinary medical students, there are times a student or administrator may request our advice or advocacy. We would only consider this with consent from the student. VSW services address a wide range of issues and concerns common to veterinary medical students. These concerns include, but are not limited to: Coping with common life concerns, such as adjustment to veterinary school, general dissatisfaction, specific stressors, and declining academic performance. Dealing with social or interpersonal problems such as the loss of a significant relationship, persistent interpersonal conflict, and difficulty finding adequate social support. Support following a distressing or traumatic life event, s uch as the death of a loved one or breakdown of a significant relationship. Dealing with developmental challenges such as coming out as LGBTQ, identity concerns, spiritual/religious crisis, and/or clarifying values, roles, and life goals. Treatment for psy chological disorders that may be managed effectively with time -limited treatment (e.g., five sessions or less per year), such as acute depression or anxiety. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 61 Treatment for more chronic disorders such as bipolar disorder or trauma -related disorders when sym ptoms \"come and go\" and may respond well to brief intervention and medication adjustments. Consultation with students, faculty, or staff regarding how to get help for a student. Psychological concerns that require intensive and/or long -term treatment may n ot be adequately addressed within a time -limited treatment frame or through \"embedded\" mental health services (embedded services are those offered from VSW mental health professionals who work in the UTCVM , as opposed to an outside provider such as the UT Psychological Clinic or a mental health professional in the community.) In such cases, VSW will work with the student to find an appropriate level of care through campus or community resources. Examples of such cases include, but are not limited to: Active addiction to alcohol or drugs, need for medical detoxification, or use of substances in a way that interferes with effective treatment and/or academic performance. Problems around eating and nutrition that may require medical support and an interdisciplin ary team approach. Evidence/risk of progressive deterioration in mental or emotional functioning that requires intensive intervention. Acute risk of harm to self or others requiring emergency intervention in a controlled environment (i.e., hospitalization). History of long -term treatment and continued need for that level of care. Student requests or expects multiple sessions in a week. A student's sufficient motivation and emotional investment in treatment is essential to effective time - limited therapy. The re are some circumstances where motivation and sufficient emotional investment may not exist. These circumstances include, but are not limited to: Coming to counseling primarily because of external pressure. Seeking counseling to fulfill class requirements . Fulfilling premarital counseling requirements. Seeking to meet imposed legal requirements or to reduce legal consequences without evidence of a personal desire to change. Inability to identify a focus of counseling and/or to take appropriate responsibility for identified concerns. Persistent non -compliance with treatment plan or recommendations. In these circumstances , VSW will assess your needs and provide you feedback about how to move forward with VSW or perhaps another path to care. VSW also is a training ground for all levels of social work practice , so social workers are often required to engage in supervision on their counseling cases with (Sma ll Animal Hospital) & B317 (3rd floor near Munch Box) is great) 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 62 Housing Students have the option of applying for housing accommodations that the University of Tennessee offers to students. However, because of the rigorous requirements of veterinary school, on -campus housing is usually not as conducive to study time as off -campus housing. The Division of Housing also maintains extensive listings of off -campus apartments, houses, rooming units , and mobile home units that are offered for rent to students, faculty, and staff. Inquiries about housing should be directed to the Division of Housing ( http://housing.utk.edu/ ), Off-Campus Housing ( https://offcampushousing.utk.edu/ ), housing may also be advertised on VetNet Classified s. Facilities Mailboxes for pre -clinical students (ye ars 1-3) are located in the \"Munchbox\" on the third floor, room B301 . Mailboxes for clinical students in their 4th year are located in the Large Animal Hospital student break room in the \"Barn,\" room D115. Mailbox numbers are grouped by class and updated every semester. Lockers are available for 1st-year students in the anatomy lab oratory hallway . Lockers for 2nd-year students are classroom, C100 . For 3rd- and 4th-year students, locker rooms with showers are located on the second floor, above the hospital. The w omen's locker room is B214 (in the S ACS hallway). The m en's locker room is B203 (in the L arge Animal Clinical Sciences hallway). Contact Alicia Robino if additional facilities or special accommodations are needed. Ride t he T - Campus Transit Service The University of Tennessee's transit system , \"The T ,\" provides students with a safe, convenient, and efficient campus -wide transportation service. Service is fare -free for all passengers, and r eal-time GPS tracking allows students to monitor current location and arrival time. The UT mobile app integrates T he T's GPS tracking map, route stop information, and news updates on route and service changes. All T vehicles are accessible to passengers with disabilities and have f ront-of-vehicle bicycle racks. Four USB charging stations are located at the back of each vehicle. For routes, scheduling, and maps, visit http://ridethet.utk.edu/ . Employment Occasionally, research faculty and other laboratories, including histopathology, pathobiology, clinical pathology, and the small and large animal hospitals, require summer, holiday period, and/or semester student assistance. Hirin g is performed by the faculty or heads of laboratories. It is suggested that DVM students not work more than 10 -15 hours per week while classes are in session. Additionally, students are discouraged from working during their first semester of coursework. Important note: All paid students are classified mandatory reporters for Title IX in cidents . Student employees should review regulations on mandatory reporting at https://titleix .utk.edu/faculty- and-staff/mandatory -reporters/ .

Once a student has a regular parking pass, the Office of the Associate Dean fo r Academic Affairs will sub mit the student's name for a special overnight pass at no extra charge. Overnight passes are routinely requested for clinical students each semester. That pass must be displayed with the paid permit to allow overnight parking and early morning parking in student lots. Parking Services does not make exceptions for hospital duty requiring parking between 3 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. If a student must be at UTCVM during these hours and does not have a pass, it is permissible to use client parking in front of the Small Animal Hospital until able to get an overnight special pass , or see the Office of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs for a temporary permit. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 73 A limited number of special permits are available to students when all student parking areas are full. However, s tudents are required to check o ther commuter lots before requesting one of these permits, and priority is given to fourth -year students who are returning to the hospitals. These passes are not intended for students who arrive late for their first class of the day. Students parking in o ther commuter lots may choose to use The T campus transit service (see above ). The most convenient commuter lots to the Veterinary Medicine Building are lot C25 on Stephenson Dr., lot C22 on Volunteer Blvd., and the G10 garage on Neyland/Philip Fulmer Way. Students are expected to familiarize themselves with these sites. Please see https://maps.utk.edu/?id=314 to locate these commuter lots and others. If a parking citation is incurred, it is in the best interest of the student to respond immediately; procrastination will result in penalties for tardy payment, a s well as problems with grade reports and future registration. All UTCVM parking areas are under university regulations. Paid student parking is ONLY in the commuter/non -commuter designated parking lots. Do not park in client spaces in the front of the hospital. Violations will be subject to fines and possibly impounding of the vehicle. Pets within the UT CVM Pets are not allowed in any multi -user space, including, but not limited to, classrooms, laboratories, conference rooms, the Pen dergrass Library, student lounge and break areas, and locker rooms. This policy applies to all teaching rooms, including A118, A335, A335A, PSB 100 /C100 , the Large Animal and Small Animal classrooms, departmental conference rooms, the Tickle seminar room, computer classrooms, the anatomy laboratory, and all small group teaching rooms. Pets scheduled as part of a teaching exercise (and documented service animals) are exempt. Pets should never be brought into areas of food preparation or rooms commonly used for food service functions. These spaces specifically include the Sequoyah Room and kitchen, the Tickle break room, student lounge s, hospital break rooms in the large and small animal hospital, or any other room where food is being prepared or served. Only pets that are active working service animals may be in food service areas, as allowed by law. Those animals must be working service animals to be included in this exception. Service animals, including HABIT animals, are permitted only when they are working , in appropriate locations, or as part of the evaluation process. Pets that are not patients or boarders are not to be brought into the Veterinary Medical Center h ospital areas. This policy applies 24/7/365 and w as developed to inform students, faculty, and staff of their responsibilities and of the UTCVM's expectations when pets belonging to employees or students are brought onto college premises (Veterinary Medicine Building , JRTU , and VREC). The intent is to maintain a professional, safe, and functiona l work and educational environment in balance with one that is welcoming. Procedure if you must bring a pet Any pet or animal that accompanies an employee, student, faculty, or staff member to the CVM must be kept behind a closed or gated door when in a pr ivate office and appropriately restrained (leash, cage, carrying tote, etc.) when in the hallway or other areas inside the UTCVM buildings or on the surrounding premises. Pets that need to accompany students to school due to reasons such as overnight shift s, medications, new puppy, or workers at your house, are welcome to day board in the hospital ward during these short periods (see Day Boarding Policy below) . Please contact the technician in charge of the ward to make arrang ements. You will be responsible for setting up the cage, walking, and cleaning the cage upon departure. There is no charge for 1 -3 days of such arrangements. (This policy has been truncated - to see full policy, please contact the Associate Dean for Hospit al Operations.) 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 74 Day Boarding Policy Day b oarders are personal pets of faculty, staff, and students of the UTCVM who are in the Small Animal Hospital for the day only. They are not kept in the hospital overnight and are not patients hospitalized for a medic al problem. Examples of acceptable reasons for day boarding include 1) animals needing periodic baths; 2) pets who need to be out of the home for a day when there is work or pesticide spraying going on in the home; 3) animals who are coming in for the HABI T program who are going to health care facilities; and 4) for people who work unusual shifts and need to be accompanied by their pets for personal safety (night shifts). Day boarders must be scheduled in advance with the ward/treatment room technician. Ind ividuals needing more frequent day boarding or boarding for other reasons will be expected to pay a day boarding charge. Animals t hat need feed, exercise, or medications must be regular, hospitalized patients or regular paying boarders and not day boarders. People who are bringing their animals in for baths are expected to purchase their shampoo and other products from the pharmacy and provide these for their personal animal's use. It will be the responsibility of the owner to provide their animal w ith water and exercise. Day boarders should be so indicated on a cage card listing the owner's name, the animal's name , and the words \"Day Boarder. \" The animal should also have a neck band on with the owner's name and animal's name. The individual will be responsible for cleaning the cage when their animal is removed at the end of the day. The papers are to be removed and the cage disinfected whether or not the animal has soiled the cage. The cage card is to be removed and clean papers put back into the cage. A cage is not to be reserved for an animal on successive days. Water bowls should be removed from the cage, washed, and returned to storage. The treatment room technicians should have a day -boarder schedule available through which approved day boarding may be arranged in advance. Anyone who abuses the provisions or does not follow the guidelines will be denied the privilege. Individuals who need more frequent boarding than these guidelines permit may request regular hospital boarding and pay the appropriate fee. Any questions or problems with day boarding should be directed to the Small Animal Clinic Director or the ward technician in charge . Children in the Academic Setting The UTCVM is a dynamic center of education, clinical service, and research, which encourages supervised events on campus for children as well as adults. The college is committed to promoting equity for all students and ensur ing that individuals are not disadvant aged in their academic and career aspirations by actual or perceived family responsibilities. However, the college is a place of work and study, and the ability to concentrate for extended periods of time is a prerequisite within a healthy academic environment. Students, faculty, staff, and administrators can expect to attend and teach class, provide clinical service, or complete work or research in laboratories, libraries, offices, and other workspaces with minim al distractions or interruptions. Therefore, guidelines have been established to ensure that an appropriate academic en vironment is maintained for the safety of all. This policy provide s for the safety of children while respecting the needs of parents/guardians given that the university and college may be held liable for the safety and health of children in the workplace. The Veterinary M edicine Building presents unique potential risks: animals, zoonotic infectious disease, biosecurity/biosafety, toxic and flammable chemicals, radiation, breakable glassware, medical instrumentation, etc. Parents/guardians should understand the importance of this policy in providing for the health and safety of their children. For this policy, \"children\" and \"child\" refer to minors under the age of 18. Children are not permitted in the Veterinary Medical Center when the parent/guardian is on scheduled duty. Children visiting the Veterinary Medical Center mu st be directly supervised at all times by an adult responsible for the child or children. Because of the potential for serious injury or illness, children are NOT permitted in the following areas: radiology ; nuclear medicine ; radiation therapy ; any small an imal ward or run area or large animal stall area where a cage, run , or stall is marked with a \"radiation\" sign; in large animal facilities near a stall 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 75 with \"barrier\" isolation; the necrops y floor; chemotherapy laboratories; isolation facilities; and laboratories with infectious agents, except when participating in programs and/or special events sp onsored by the college and supervised by UTCVM personnel. Children are prohibited from entering other potentially dangerous locations such as laboratories, Veterinary Medical Center facilities, and equipment rooms without the approval of the appropriate dean, department head, or supervisor. Children may not attend a class in session without prior approval of the course instructor. Children under the care of the instructor may not attend class without the prior approval of his/her department head and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs. Parents who disregard this policy will be required to remove their child from the building and will receive a written reprimand from the appropriate dean, department chair, or administrative supervisor. Students who miss a class/clinical rotations for child care needs are expected to make up missed time. Parents who are missing an in -person lecture(s) because they must b e at home with a sick child should be able to view recorded lectures at home or may work with classmate s or the instructor to provide a live-stream Zoom . Student Voting Rights Every registered voter is allowed time to vote on Election Day. Each student should enjoy the rights and privilege of voting as a U.S. citizen. Students on clinics must meet clinical and patient obligations but remember that there are four options f or voting: 1) Early voting - includes Saturday until noon. 2) Mail- in ballot - as a full- time student, you may qualify for a mail- in ballot. Apply early. 3) Voting before or after clinics. Most polls are open between 7 a.m. - 7 p.m. 4) Request voting leave - must requ est at least 24 hours in advance (no more than 3 hours of leave). United States citizens 18 and over may register to vote. You may choose to vote in your home state or county by absentee ballot or register as a new voter at your current, local address.

Legal Name Changes In addition to informing Ms. Deborah Shepherd , the following form must be completed to make a name change with the University of Tennessee: http://onestop.utk.edu/contact -updates/ . Before making a name change with the university, s tudents are strongly encouraged to discuss the procedure for nam e changes with Ms. Deborah Shepherd to avoid potential issues with financial aid. Inclement Weather Policy The University of Tennessee remains open except in the most severe weather conditions. If the university is closed, academic classes, laboratories, and examinations will be rescheduled as appropriate. If the university remains open, students are expected to attend scheduled academic classes but are advised to avoid undue risks in travel. Students are responsible for any academic work missed and are responsible for taking the initiative to complete such work. Alerts will be sent by e- mail and/or text message as soon as the decision is made with regard to inclement weather. Students are expected to report to their regularly scheduled classes only if there are 30 or more minutes remaining in the session . Local media generally list all closures on their web page s, and the Tennessee Department of Transportation reports on the road conditions at https://smartway.tn.gov/traffic/?position= -86.3568304,35.8630463,7&features=incidents,traffic . For more information, see the at https://prepare.utk.edu/emergency - management/inclement -weather -policy/ . Senior Rotation Students Students remain responsible for patients and clinical duties on the days w hen the university is closed due to inclement weather. Students are expected to report to the VMC as long as they can safely travel to and from the hospital. Students are not expected to subject themselves to unreasonable danger in traveling. If a student determines it is obvious that he or she cannot arrive at the VMC for the day's activities, the student should contact someone on their medical team by 8:00 am and inform their attending clinician of their absence. S tudents may leave a message with the oper ator or receptionist, but it is the student's responsibility to confirm receipt of the message . Students who can safely travel to and from the hospital on that day will then be reassigned for clinical duty to ensure that all essential services are maintain ed. A student on a shift must not leave until relieved by an individual on the next shift! Technicians, house officer s, and faculty will be used as needed to supplement those students who are available so that appropriate clinical service can be maintained . Dr. Samantha Beaty , State Veterinarian The state veterinarian is responsible for monitoring and protecting animal health in Tennessee. The state veterinarian also works with private veterinarians, animal pathologists, and the state's network of animal disease diagnostic laboratories in identifying diseases and making a definitive diagnosis in cases of animal deaths. The state veterinarian is responsible for the certification and enforcement of animal health standards required for interstate and internatio nal commerce of livestock and livestock products. This office also cooperates with federal animal health officials in accrediting Tennessee's approximately 1,700 practicing private veterinarians. The State Veterinarian's Office may be contacted at 615 -837-5120. Student Safety and Potential Hazards The potential for human injury always exists in veterinary medical practice. The same risks are inevitable for the veterinary student. The possibility of injury increases whenever the person is careless, under chemical influence, handicapped, or pregnant (with increased danger for both mother and fetus). The 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 77 college stands ready to provide full assistance to students in accommodating schedule and assignment changes made necessary by pregnancy, disability, or handic ap. Treatment of Animals Unauthorized individuals are not allowed in the hospital. Only UTCVM students are allowed to assist with the treatment of animals. Family, friends, and other non -UTCVM individuals must not assist. Children are prohibited from accom panying students in the Large Animal Clinic while the student is on duty or caring for patients in any manner. This is for the safety of the children and other individuals. Student Health Center & Health Insurance Neither the college nor the university car ries medical insurance to cover student accidents, and students are not covered by state workers' compensation insurance. In light of the risks and hazards inherent in veterinary medical education and the potential for veterinary student accident and or in jury, students are required to be covered by some form of major medical health insurance while in school. It is not sufficient for the veterinary student to seek care only through the Student Health Center outpatient clinic. If a veterinary student is hurt or injured during the veterinary curriculum, the student needs insurance coverage for the expenses associated with any required medical care, including emergency care. Insurance may be acquired through a family major medical policy, through a private insu rance agency, or by purchasing the University of Tennessee Student Government -sponsored Student Injury and Sickness Insurance Plan. It is highly advisable that the insurance plan offer appropriate, comprehensive coverage in Knox County. International Stude nts: All international students are generally required to hold UT Student Health Insurance. They are charged automatically for the insurance plan but may opt to have it waived and that charge returned, given that their private policy covers all items outlined under the UT Student Health Center's documentation requirements for a waiver: https://studenthealth.utk.edu/international -students/ . International students must communicate with International Student and Scholar Services. Waivers may be requested from the insurance representatives listed on the Web page. More information about health insurance available to all UT students can be found at http://studenthealth.utk.edu/insrec_studentinsurance.php . Additionally, a required Health Insurance Acknowledgement must be signed prior to participation in the clinical curriculum. A copy is provided in the appendix . The Student Health Center provides a variety of services, including primary medical care, health education, health screening programs, and mental health consultation and counseling. HOURS: M on, Tues, Thur, Fri-8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; W ed-9 a.m. to 5 p.m. To learn more visit: http://studenthealth.utk.edu/index.php . Students ma y also choose to see their primary care physician. To use the on -campus Student Health Center, students must pay the Health Fee each semester; for students enrolled in at least 9 hours in a semester, this fee ($101 for fall and spring, $61 for summer in th e 2021-2022 academic year) is automatically applied as part of the Programs and Services fee and cannot be reimbursed. The Health Fee covers many professional services, but it does not cover hospitalization, laboratory tests, X -rays, drugs, etc. For any st udent not paying the student Health Fee in a given semester, the Health Fee will apply prior to service. Student counseling services may also require a separate fee. After Student Health Center hours , students (as well as non -UTCVM externs or visitors ) may be seen Care (9625 Kroger Park Dr., Ste 300, Knoxville, 37922), or Lakeway Urgent Care (2461 University Commons Way, Knoxville, 37919; 865 -673-6603). Student Injury Any student injured during the course of their study or clinical duty must immediately report the injury to their instructor or immediate supervisor. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 78 The instructor/supervisor must report student injuries occurring while the student is in the Veterinary Medical Center or participating in related educational activities. Notification should go to the Laboratory Safety Coordinator, AND the appropriate department office: Biomedical and Diagnostic Sciences (865-974-5576), Large Animal Clinical Sciences (865- 974-5703), or Small Animal Clinical Sciences (865 -974- 5505) office. An I ncident Report must be complete d by the student and filed by the supervisor/faculty member with the Laboratory Safety Coordinator (see appendix ) within 24 hours of injury. Students are advised, but not required , to seek medical attention, as needed. Rabies In accordance with the CDC's guidance on human rabies Pre -exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) vaccination series, the UTCVM requires* all incoming to complete at leas t a 2-dose PrEP . For 1st-year students, this vaccine series must be completed before October 1 of the year of entry, before the student's first Clinical Experience (CE). For Ross and St. George's students, the series must be completed before the start of the first scheduled clini cal rotation. All DVM students are considered to be Risk Category 2 , as they will perform animal necropsies during their education. Recommendations for this risk category are as follows: 2 doses, days 0 and 7 Check titer every 2 years A 2-year titer check will align with the scheduled 3rd year of DVM education. In the semester before transitioning to clinical rotations, all transitioning students are required* to submit proof of an adequate rabies antibody level of 0.5 IU/mL (World Health Organization gu idelines) to the Laboratory Safety Coordinator. Results lower than 0.5 IU/mL will require a booster dose to be scheduled by the student as soon as possible and a subsequent titer test scheduled for 1 year later. For the convenience of students, UTCVM host s an on -site Rabies Titer Clinic every year before each class transitions to clinics. The cost of the test per student is $45 by check or money order, paid to the order of Atlanta Health Associates , to be collected from the student by the Laboratory Safety Coordinator upon arrival for the appointment. Students employed by UTCVM at the time of their titer test are paid for by their respective department. All results are delivered to the student via e -mail by the Laboratory Safety Coordinator. Rabies PrEP boo ster doses are not supplied or scheduled by UTCVM. Incoming 1st-year, Ross, and St. George's students who completed the 2 -dose or 3 -dose PrEP 2 or more years prior to their entry to UTCVM are required* to submit proof of adequate antibody response or a booster dose administered within 1 year of entry. Alternatively, these incoming students may participate in the UTCVM Rabies Titer Clinic. First -year students who have completed the PrEP within 1 year of entering UTCVM or established pre- clinical students who are repeating a year may postpone titer testing until their year of transition. *UTCVM does not offer vouchers or reimbursement for the rabies PrEP or titer testing. Students are encouraged to ask their insurance provider about coverage and/or request an y reimbursement for the vaccine or titer test from their provider. Letters of verification of these rabies requirements can be supplied upon inquiry to the Laboratory Safety Coordinator or Office of Academic and Student Affairs, to be sent by the student to their insurance provider. Questions on rabies and related requirements can be directed to the Laboratory Safety Coordinator. Radiation Safety Each clinical student is assigned a radiation dosimeter badge, which must be worn when assisting with radiograp hic or nuclear medicine procedures. The badges are to be kept on the board in the radiology work area when not in use. The badges are not to be taken outside the building. The badges are changed at the beginning of every quarter ( January, April, July, Octo ber), and the radiation dose for each student is determined. Reports are given to the Radiology Section Chief and the campus radiation safety officer. Faculty, students, and some staff are considered occupational workers and have a maximum exposure limit o f 5,000 mrem per year. All exposure levels should be kept below the \"as low as reasonably 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 79 achievable\" (ALARA) limit of 500 mrem/year. Based on data from previous years, the average clinical student will receive an annual exposure of 110 - 120 mrem. Students will not get monthly reports, but they will be informed if their badge reading is high. If you have questions about dosimeter badge reading, contact the Radiology Service. A $25 fee is charged for lost radiation safety badges. Lab Coat Safety Prior to entering the clinical curriculum, it is ideal for each student to have at least two lab coats. Coats may be temporarily borrowed from the Laboratory Safety Coordinator. For students in the clinic, lab coats should be be washed on a cycle by thems elves or with scrubs. Hospital garb should not be washed in the same cycle with domestic clothing. Coats should be washed on a monthly basis, at minimum. It is not required to wash a lab coat after every laboratory - only in the event of a notable spill, splatter, mess, odor, etc. When cleaning lab coats after a messy pre -clinical laboratory or incident in the clinic, significantly soiled coats should be kept out of domestic washers, as they can harbor chemical and biological hazards, depending on the situ ation. Off- site dry cleaning is an option. If a significant incident or a hazard exposure occurs in a teaching laboratory or during a clinical rotation, lab coats can be washed in the UTCVM Laundry Facility. Students must write their name or Net ID on the coat tag if their name is not embroidered on the front, and specify to Central Sterilization that they are dropping off a student coat . Central Sterilization washes coats early Wednesday mornings , and they are ready for pickup in late morning. Always check pockets for pens and sharps before leaving a coat with them! Student Biosafety during COVID -19 Pandemic Students are expected to follow UTCVM, university , and CDC guidelines to protect the health and safety of themselves and others during this prolonged a nd deadly pandemic. It is critically important that students follow the guidelines for biosafety and onsite protocol during the COVID -19 pandemic. Guidelines change frequently , so vigilant awareness and attention to COVID -related communications is required. COVID -19 vaccination is strongly encouraged for all students who can be vaccinated. All students are expected to adhere to the following guidelines : Regularly m onitor health for signs of illness . Students with any signs of illness or a temperature rise of 2 or more degrees must not attend in person and are still responsible for learning. Visit/speak with a healthcare provider to determine if testing is necessary. If a student is positive for COVID -19, they are advised to follow current CDC guidelines for isolation . Unvaccinated s tudents exposed to any positive COVID -19 case are advised to quarantine for 5 days. In addition, clinical students (including pre -clinical students participating in clinical experiences) are expected to: Arrive in clean clothes and a lab coat , clean scrubs , or coveralls. Wear shoes that can be disinfected (ideally, a specific pair designated for the hospital only). Complete a leave form during a time of quarantine or isolation and coordinate with the clinician on make -up requirements. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 80 For externships, b e aware that travel to high -risk areas may require unvaccinated students to quarantine and/or provide a nega tive test result before returning to clinics. Please observe all COVID -19 policies for our college found on VetNet . Be aware that these plans may be modified bas ed on changes in COVID risks within our community or the university . Therefore, students should check policies frequently. General Biosafety Procedures By working in an area where animals may be present, students are at risk for being exposed to a variety of different organisms that might result in human disease. Risks include accidental ingestion, inhalation, contact with broken skin or mucous membranes, and bites. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the risks of acquiring an illness from animals an d adhere to practices to minimize those risks to yourself and others. Wherever possible, eliminate exposure to the hazardous material or substitute with a less hazardous alternative. Apply universal precautions, and treat all body fluids and exudates as po tentially infectious material. Always wash hands before and after handling animals or their specimens and before exiting labs. Avoid touching the eyes, face, and unprotected skin while performing duties or lab work. Do not store or consume food or beverage s in labs or in any area where hazardous materials or animals are present. Wear personal protective equipment as recommended (may include protective eyewear, lab coats, gloves, respiratory protection, etc.). Full information for hygiene and infection cont rol practices may be found here: https://liveutk.sharepoint.com/sites/utcvm/students/SitePages/Health%20and%20Safety.aspx . Biosafety and biosecurity p rocedures are taught throughout all 4 years of the veterinary curriculum and emphasized in Transitions Seminars. Upon entry into the clinical curriculum, each student will demonstrate adequate knowledge of biosecurity and safety procedures in large and sma ll animal isolation. Each student will observe the isolation training video and successfully demonstrate to clinical faculty or staff the proper biosafety protocol when entering and exiting small and large isolation facilities before continuing to the clin ical rotations. Individual biosafety procedures are also found in the Small and Large Animal Student Handbooks located on the UTCVM Web site (https://vetmed.tenn essee.edu/academics/current -students/handbook -and-policies/ ). Isolation are available online: https://liveutk.sharepoint.com/sites /utcvm/students/SitePages/Handbooks.aspx . Guidelines for Pregnant Veterinary Medical Students The potential for injury during the education of veterinary students increases during pregnancy. The greatest potential hazards are accidents that may occur while working with animal patients or during necropsy of diseased patients. Such accidents may caus e physical injury to the student and/or the unborn child. Additional potential hazards include exposure to toxic agents, hormones, infectious organisms, inhalation of anesthetics, radiation, and stress of physical exertion (See State of Tennessee Right to Know Act, https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/workforce/documents/majorpublications/requiredposers/TOSHA_ Poster_Legal_Size.pdf) . When working with animal patients, students should always be cautious to prevent injury to themselves and/or the patient. Precautions should also be taken to minimize necessary exposure to the pharmacologic, infectious, and radiation hazards listed above . Total avoidance of these potential hazards will not be possible in the veterinary curriculum. Students should use all previous training and current instructions to minimize hazards to themselves, their patients, and their unborn children. The pregnant st udent should immediately consult with a physician for advice concerning ways to minimize exposure to potential hazards that may be associated with a veterinary student's educational assignments, including the advisability of interrupting t heir program of s tudy during the pregnancy. In order to minimize the possibility of injury, it may be advisable for a pregnant student to continue as a regular student only with schedule and assignment changes aimed at reducing such risk. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 81 Students are encouraged, but not r equired, to consult with the Associate Dean f or Academic Affairs when learning of pregnancy and with the Occupational Health and Safety Nurse to review a course plan and identify areas of concern within the curriculum . Rights and responsibilities It is recognized that pregnant students maintain their established student rights. Pregnant students are expected to complete each and every requirement of the veterinary curriculum. If the risks of completing certain components or specific assignments in the DV M curriculum are deemed unacceptable, pregnant students will develop, in consultation with and after approval by faculty, an alternate equivalent plan or schedule deemed acceptable by the university, the student, and the student's attending physician. Preg nant students should also consult the following resources related to reproductive health: and Safety Guidelines , and (3) UT Reproductive Health Safety Guide IH -040. Curriculum Concerns Recommendations for protecting the reproductive health of individuals from occupational exposure to chemical, biological, radioactive, and other substances include the following (lists are not always exhaustive; always check with your physician for specific guidance based on your individual health needs): Laboratories Formalin exposure in anatomy laboratories Anesthetic gas exposure in surgery laboratories Clinical Rotations Long work hours, exposure to unruly small and large animals, exposure to toxic drugs, and exposure to infectious diseases Diagnostic Imaging rotation - Expo sure to X-rays Pathology rotation - Physical labor of lifting heavy animals, slippery floors, zoonotic diseases (e.g., toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, brucellosis, salmonella, etc.), exposure to formalin, exposure to dimethyl sulfoxide Field Services rot ation , etc.); environmentally hot, humid, and sometimes dusty conditions, with much standing and walking required; exposure to large and sometimes unruly animals Anesthesiology and Surgery rotation s - Exposure to anesthetic gases Best Practices It is in the best interest of a pregnant student to maintain regular contact with their physic ian and to take appropriate steps to minimize exposure to hazards inherent in veterinary medical education. However, the college cannot fundamentally alter its established curriculum or academic program. While pregnancy is not generally considered a disability, pregnant students may wish to inform the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs as early as possible in their pregnancy, to facilitate communication and to take advantage of available options (as listed below). For questions regarding chemical exposure and pregnancy, contact UT Environmental Health and Safety at (865) 974 -5084 or safety@utk.edu . For questions regarding biological exposures and pregnancy, contact the UT Biosafety office at (865) 974- 1938 or utbiosafety@utk.edu . Radiological hazards may be found in laboratories, medical facilities, and some analytical equipment. Radiological sources should be marked with warning/caution statements. Exposures to radiological sou rces may come from direct contact with materials or indirect exposures via proximity to radiation sources. For questions regarding radiological exposure, contact the UT Radiation Safety office at (865) 974 -5580 or radiationsafety@utk.edu . 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 82 Available Options Students may opt to continue regular student enrollment with selected schedule and assignment changes, as needed. This option is not without risks and could result in delay of completion of the DVM program, e specially if maternity leave is required prior to completion. This option is dependent upon: Student's ability to participate in any revised educational program Ability of the college to make changes in the student's schedule of clinical assignments in advance Availability and willingness of classmates to exchange scheduled rotation assignments with the pregnant student Students may request a leave of absence for pregnancy and child delivery. Similarly, paternity leave may be granted for students to care fo r their partner or help with the arrival of a newborn. Students will be required to complete all assignments and course requirements that were missed during short -term leave. By taking leave, students may incur additional costs in tuition and fees should t hey require enrollment in additional semesters beyond the normative time for degree completion. Students in good academic standing may submit a written request to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs to withdraw from the DVM program for a period of time, not to exceed 1 academic year. Students who are allowed to withdraw may be readmitted, upon application approved by the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, and permitted to graduate with a subsequent class. Withdrawals longer than an academic year may necessitate repeat of prior course material or semesters. This option minimizes health hazards and risks associated with attempting to continue a veterinary medical education while maintaining a safe pregna ncy. Mothering Rooms Two lactation rooms are available for students, staff, and faculty who return to school/work following maternity leave and are still breastfeeding. One room is in the far right corner of the women's locker room on the second floor (Room B214). While its use is on a first -come, first -served basis, there is a dry erase board and paper log available to record usage. This room may better serve underclassmen and those in the Large Animal Clinic, due to location. The room has a comfortable chair, an additional chair, a power strip, and a refrigerator for milk storage. There is a second lactation room (B229C) on the second floor of the Tickle Small Animal Clinic, which may be more convenient for those located in the Small Animal Clinic. This room has a sink, desk, and chairs; a lock on the door; and is labeled as a privacy room. A refrigerator where milk can be stored is also available. Similarly, there is a log to record usage.

Year 1 Elections Elections are guided by the 2nd-year class presidents during the first several weeks of school. The process is initiated when an e -mail is sent out listing what leadership positions are available and a description of the responsibilities for each position. Additionally, the 2nd-year student executive board meets with the 1st-year class to talk in more detail about the positions they hold. Nominations f ollow during the next week. Students have the option to run as individuals or as co -position holders, and there are no set rules about which positions are singular and which are co -positions; however, traditionally, president, social chairs, and fundraisin g chairs are all co -positions due to work load required and responsibilities. Presidents have traditionally included one female and one male in order to broadly represent the class. Once the nomination period is over, each self -nominated candidate or set o f co- candidates gives a short speech to the class during a free lunch period. Then, the 2nd-year presidents run the actual elections. Usually, there are printed paper ballots where one's choice is to be circled. If electronic ballots are to be used, the vo ting process must be announced well in advance, and a process for accounting for individual student ballots must be in place. Second -year presidents are in charge of counting ballots and reporting the results to the first years. 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 84 Year 2 and 3 Elections Each class holds elections at either the end of the spring semester (usually the 3rd years) or the beginning of the fall semester. These are run similarly as 1st-year elections in that following the announcement of elections, there is a week for self-nominations. If there are multiple nominees for any position, then the current position holder and challenger both give speeches, and then voting occurs. The presidents are in charge of this unless they too are running against someone, in which case a nother unchallenged officer will be in charge of counting ballots to ensure fairness. If a position is unchallenged, the current position holder can choose to retain that position for the year or decline it, and the position will be opened and the class as ked to fill it. If no one fills the position, the responsibilities of that position are absorbed by the rest of the e xecutive board. Any challenge to the election process is managed through university policy described by the Student Government Association . Class F inancial R esponsibilities Classes are managed like clubs. With the assistance of SAVMA, they are responsible for filing taxes, and they may not solicit donations as a tax -deductible representative of the Univers ity of Tennessee, including the UT College of Veterinary Medicine. Each class is responsible for a significant financial commitment each year, which is why the fundraisers, social chairs, and president positions are labor intensive. The 1 st-year class over sees the Halloween Party as its major event. The cost is typically around $3,000, and substantial fundraising is required, especially from this newly established class. The 2nd-year class oversees the Halfway to Clinics formal event, which varies in cost b etween $6,000- $10,000. A considerable portion of the cost is covered by ticket sales, but considerable fundraising efforts are also required by the class. The 3 rd-year class oversees Open House , typically held on the second weekend in April. While approxim ately $3,500 comes from sponsors, the class is responsible for the othe r $3,500, which comes from fund raising efforts. The following is a suggested general outline of class officers: Class Officers Typically , each class will have each of these positions: President (2) . Preside over all meetings and be a member of all standing and temporary committees. Meet regularl y with the Associate Dean. Time commitment: considerable. Vice President ( 1-2).

These students can provide advice on classes, studying, and other resources they found useful. Faculty Advisor/Advis ee Program Each incoming student is assigned to a participating faculty member for advising . This takes the form of faculty advising students in their academic pursuits but also for externship and elective advice. The faculty member acts as a resource for academic situations. Additionally, the Educational Enhancement Committee sponsors a lunch event in both semesters to allow advisors and advisee s to interact. Additional social events can be planned at the discretion of the advisors . Study Days Study days are held in the fall and spring semester, between the end of class and the beginning of exams.

Published dates are subject to change. Advice for First -Year Students...from Upperclassmen Study Skills \"Find whatever works for you, whether that is studying individually or in a group. Also, your study group won't necessarily be your friend group. I know p ersonally that I enjoy studying with others, but I can't study with my best friends. Change up your study habits for each class or each semester until you are happy with them.\" \"If you have an effective study strategy, stick with it! Don't let other people pressure you into a different study style if it is not your own. Try to get involved in some interesting clubs and wander down to the hospital and ask questions. The vets are more than willing to answer questions. Make sure to reserve some time for yourse lf and the stuff you love. Read, workout, do anything you enjoy!\" \"Study hard but also take time to exercise and do things you love. It will keep you sane!\" \"For every class you had a lecture in, study 30-50 minutes per subject each night. Then, take one evening off per weekend to do something enjoyable.\" \"Take the objectives that are handed out in class very seriously, especially for Anatomy! Start studying as soon as you can for every test. But don't forget to spend time with your family and friends; you will need a support system! Also, try to find something you like about every class to make it more enjoyable. Always keep a positive attitude, and you will do great!\" \"Stay ahead. If you want a jump start, purchase the anatomy book early from Amazon and j ust start reading. Having a general idea of material before will help as you won't be seeing it for the first time. Don't worry about what other people are doing. Everyone studies and learns differently. Just do whatever works for YOU. Don't shrug off the 'easy' classes. No class is easy, so don't let a lower credit class get the best of you.\" \"See what textbooks the library has in the stacks or online, and try them out before you buy them!\" \"Make yourself a day- to-day schedule and STICK to it. Even if you don't have a test coming up, make sure you set aside a couple hours a night for reviewing material, but also set aside at least an hour or two a night to do what you enjoy, be it working out or just watching some TV. It will be a little rocky and a little rough at first to live by a set schedule, but in the end you will greatly appreciate the fact that you did.\" \"A lot of places require a 3.5 GPA or higher for internships after you graduate. They tell you not to worry too much about grades, but obviously, if you have certain things in mind, you do need to worry about your grades.\" 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 87 \"Ask lots of questions of your faculty. They will answer. Don't freak out; it doesn't get you anywhere.\" \"Get the dissection guides for anatomy.\" \"Go to rounds; it's okay if you don't know the answers.\" \"Join some clubs, but not ALL of them. Take a break every now and then.\" \"Study the way it works for you. Don't change the way you study just because someone said it works for them.\" \"Don't get bogged down trying to learn everything on your own. Make friends and study with them. It's also okay to use past class study materials to supplement your learning. That material saves a lot of time and effort, but be careful as there can be some mistakes.\" \"Find a good small group of friends to study with. It makes the long nights much more bearable.\" \"When you are trying to figure out how to study when coming to vet school, DO NOT change your habits that work for you because someone else told you that you wouldn't have time to make f lash cards or study guides, etc. Continue to study how you did in undergrad and make changes as you see fit. I changed how I studied the first semester based on what the second years told me...bad idea. When I switched back to studying how I'm used to, my grades soared. So, don't always listen to what others tell you to do/not do.\" \"Get the dissection kit. You will need it regardless of your lab habits. Sundays are for cooking; Saturdays are for studying and cleaning. Use a crock pot.\" \"Ask the students from the previous year which textbooks to buy. Sometimes the professors think books are more or less helpful than they really are. Study for all your classes regardless of what students from previous years tell you. Learn to share work. You are not possibl y going to make a study guide for each class, but all of you together can. Share notes, share advice from big siblings, share everything. You're not in competition anymore, and most of you will need the help just to get through your courses without going crazy.\" Disability \"If you have a learning disability, set up your accommodations before starting vet school. I didn't think I would need mine because I didn't use my accommodations much in undergrad, but you'll want it for school.\" Social \"Definitely make time in your busy schedule to do things that you love and do things with friends and family. Also, join at least one club to get to know other vet students and faculty better. \" \"It is very competitive to get into veterinary school, but once you get here, leave the competition at the door. You will be with your classmates for 4 years and in those 4 years , you will become like family. Make sure to always help others out because ther e will be a time when you need help yourself. \" \"Show up early on the first day to pick your seat. You're going to be spending 5 hours a day in it for 9 months, so you might as well be sitting somewhere you like.\" \"Allow yourself to say NO to a lot of adorable faces or else you might graduate with several times more pets than you started with!\" \"Don't come to school if you are really sick/contagious; no one wants your sickness to spread to the entire class.\" \"You get a discount at the animal hospital.\" Technical \"I would strongly recommend taking notes electronically. We have too many classes and too many notes to effectively carry around paper notes. You can either use a laptop or a tablet. I personally like using a tablet ( doesn't matter which brand) a nd OneNote so you can write directly on the slides and draw any pictures or diagrams presented in class. \" \"Stethoscopes can be bought from VBOT for a competitive price. Any of them will do.\" \"Get boots for PD and Anatomy (2nd semester) - easily found at Walmart - get early so that the entire class doesn't end up going to get some and they run out. Preferably ones that go up near your knees, but most will do.\" \"Coveralls run large. If on the edge for height, go lower. You can also try them on in VBOT.\" \"VBOT has low -price unisex scrubs!\" 2022-2023 Professional Student Handbook UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE 88 \"Park in Brehm parking lot - the one facing Neyland Dr/Joe Johnson Dr.\" \"Sign up for your parking pass online. You can have it mailed to you.\" \"Look at getting an apartment early in the summer. The waiting lists are shorter, and it takes away the stress of moving in and starting school at the same time.\" \"You do you. That can mean a lot of things, but I think it's an important concept to understand for vet school. You are a part of a tight- knit group of highly motivated individuals - that is wonderful and challenging. Keep perspective and take care of yourself. Vet school is a marathon, not a sprint. If you take things one exam, one day, one step at a time, you won't be so overwhelmed.\" \"Vet school is like a race - if you start out really strong at the beginning of the semester then you don't have to push as hard at the end. AKA, if you do really well on your exams in the beginning, you won't have to do as well on f inals.\" Clinical \"Look through your skills handbook or on eMedley every day. Sev eral professors adhere to the 3 -day rule, and it is easy to forge t to log skills. A lot of the skills are simple , and you wouldn't even think that they'd be on there to log them.
