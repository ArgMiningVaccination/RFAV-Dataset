The Korean National Health Insurance Corporation has reported an increasing trend in sleep disorders (disease code: G47) among young adults. Many studies have reported that poor sleep quality and reduced sleep time are related to a decline in overall quality of life and increased risk for further cardiovascular events [ [3](#B3-nrp-14-606)]. As such, sleep itself is considered essential for overall quality of life and cardiovascular health. However, several studies rely upon subjective sleep surveys to investigate nocturnal profiles or intervention effectiveness, despite the fact that self-reported questionnaires introduce method bias that undermines their scientific validity [ [4](#B4-nrp-14-606)]. Objective sleep assessments, in addition to self-reported surveys, are thereby necessary for an accurate sleep health evaluation. [5](#B5-nrp-14-606)]. A previous study monitored sleep patterns with an actigraph to uncover relationships between sleep and perceived quality of life and concluded that improvement of sleep parameters as detected by actigraph was accompanied by enhanced perceived quality of life [ [6](#B6-nrp-14-606)]. [7](#B7-nrp-14-606)]. Cardiac autonomic imbalance due to sleep disorders is associated with CVD incidence [ [8](#B8-nrp-14-606)]. A reduction in vagal tone, including a decrease in parasympathetic activity during sleep, has also been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in CVD [ [9](#B9-nrp-14-606)]. A recent study monitoring chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients with poor sleep quality using heart rate variability (HRV) revealed that these patients demonstrated decreased vagal activity during nighttime sleep, suggesting the HRV index could be a significant predictor of cardiac autonomic imbalance caused by disrupted sleep [ [10](#B10-nrp-14-606)]. As such, when assessing health problems related to sleep disorders, nocturnal HRV indices of cardiac autonomic regulation may provide critical information. [11](#B11-nrp-14-606) [12](#B12-nrp-14-606)] therapies to improve nighttime sleep. Nutritional therapy for induction of sleep could be used long-term without side effects and represents a potential alternative approach for sleep improvement [ [11](#B11-nrp-14-606)]. However, many nutrition-related sleep studies were dependent on self-reporting of the effectiveness of interventions [ [13](#B13-nrp-14-606)]. It remains unknown whether nutritional treatment can improve sleep quality or affect nocturnal HRV indices of cardiac autonomic regulation. New methods are thereby needed to evaluate the effects of sleep-inducing nutritional interventions, a need underscored by the rapid increase of sleep disorders and the relation of long-term sleep disorders to future CVD [ [2](#B2-nrp-14-606) [3](#B3-nrp-14-606)]. We have hypothesized that sleep-inducing juice which was made up of natural extracts will provide positive effects on sleep quality and enhance cardiac autonomic regulation for better-quality in sleep. To examine this hypothesis, the present study was performed to verify effectiveness of sleep-inducing juice composed of natural extracts on sleep quality and to examine whether an intervention to enhance sleep has influenced on HRV in adults who are suffering from sleep deprivation. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Subjects [Fig. 1](#F1-nrp-14-606)). The clinical characteristics of the participants are presented in [Table 1](#T1-nrp-14-606). After being informed of the experimental procedures, all participants provided written informed consent indicating voluntary participation before beginning the study. This study was approved by the Kyungpook National University Life Science Ethics Committee (IRB: 2017-0033). Table 1 Trial Anthropometry and hemodynamics [14](#B14-nrp-14-606)], body was calculated by Jackson and Pollock equation following skinfold measurements of 3 sites with caliper (Dynatronics Corp., Salt Lake City, UT, USA) and body fat percentages were estimated by Siri equation. Participants remained in a seated position for 20 min or more, after which systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean heart rate were obtained on their non-dominant arm using a BP monitor (BM 16; Beurer GmBH & Co.). follows: [(2 \u00d7 DBP) + SBP]/3. Subjective sleep quality and fatigue assessments [15](#B15-nrp-14-606)]. Each dimension is scored on a Likert-type scale from 0 to 3, with 0 representing normal, and 3 representing extremely disrupted. Global PSQI scores range from 0 to 21. A score of at least 5 indicates a poor sleeper who suffers from serious difficulties in 2 domains or moderate difficulties in 3 domains of sleep. In addition, the Pittsburgh sleep diary consists of bedtime and wake-time sections [ [16](#B16-nrp-14-606)]. Subjects were instructed to complete the both every day when they wore the actigraph. Bedtime questionnaires involved timing of breakfast, lunch and dinner; caffeine, alcohol and tobacco product consumption; use of prescribed and over-the-counter medications; and timing and duration of daytime exercise and naps. Wake-time questionnaires contained timing of going to bed, turning out lights, minutes to sleep onset; final wake-time, method of final waking; incidence, duration, and reasons for wake after sleep onset (WASO); and subjective quality of sleep episode, mood on awakening (tense vs. calm), and alertness on awakening, marked on 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS). The 9-item fatigue severity scale (FSS) and VAS scores were combined to assess the subjective intensity of fatigue on functional and behavioral aspects of daily life [ [17](#B17-nrp-14-606)]. The Korean version of the FSS presented a high internal consistency (Cronbach's = 0.93), and the item-total correlation ranged from 0.56 to 0.90 [ [18](#B18-nrp-14-606)]. Each item was expressed on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Possible scoring range was 9 to 63, with higher scores ( 36) reflecting greater levels of fatigue. The 10 cm VAS was also quantified and contributed to calculations of overall fatigue status. HRV analysis [19](#B19-nrp-14-606)]. Presently, a standardized protocol for nocturnal HRV analysis during sleep has not been established. However, previous studies have proposed recording starting one hour after going to bed [ [20](#B20-nrp-14-606) [21](#B21-nrp-14-606)]. Considering the shortest duration of sleep among study participants, nocturnal cardiac autonomic regulation was evaluated over a 240 min period at least one hour after bedtime. Time-course changes of HRV indices during sleep were assessed by dividing total sleep periods into 30 min intervals (60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 min after sleep). We computed time, frequency, and nonlinear indices using the first 5 min of each period. Time domain index, square root of the mean squared differences between successive RR intervals (rMSSD), and NN50 divided by the total number of RR intervals, which reflect vagal activity, were calculated. Low frequency (0.04-0.15 Hz) and high frequency (HF; 0.15-0.4 Hz) values were extracted via power spectrum density analysis by fast Fourier transform method [ [22](#B22-nrp-14-606)]. Nonlinear techniques have increased in importance in recent studies because non-invasive bio-signals commonly present with non-stationary characteristics. A Poincar\u00e9 plot applicable to short-term HRV measures schematized the association between continuous RR intervals. This plot is derived from a nonlinear index such as SD of the instantaneous beat-to-beat variability of data (SD1), or deviation of instantaneous RR interval variability by short diameter of ellipse, and transverse axis. Actigraphy [23](#B23-nrp-14-606)]. The Sadeh algorithm previously validated on a sample of young adults, was used to calculate objective sleep measures [ [24](#B24-nrp-14-606)]. Validity and reliability were improved by analyzing 4 days, with the 2 least reliable days excluded. Statistical analysis RESULTS Anthropometrics and hemodynamic indices [Table 1](#T1-nrp-14-606)) were associated with either group. Subjective sleep quality and fatigue index [Table 1](#T1-nrp-14-606)), while no significant differences in these values were observed for N-FS (P > 0.05, [Table 1](#T1-nrp-14-606)). Significant session \u00d7 time period interaction effects were observed on subjective measures of sleep quality and perceived fatigue (PSQI and FSS scores with VAS, P < 0.01; respectively). Resting and nocturnal cardiac autonomic regulation [Table 2](#T2-nrp-14-606)). A significant session \u00d7 time period interaction effect was observed on HF at rest (P < 0.05, [Table 2](#T2-nrp-14-606)). Table 2 [Table 3](#T3-nrp-14-606)); those of the N-FS did not show significant differences in total periods of nocturnal cardiac autonomic regulation (data not shown). Significant session \u00d7 time period interaction effects on HRV indices reflecting vagal activity at 210 min during sleep were also observed (rMSSD, HF, and SD1, P < 0.05; all 3). Table 3 Objective sleep quality [Table 4](#T4-nrp-14-606)). In contrast, MI was significantly decreased in FS from baseline (P < 0.05), while that of N-FS tended to increase compared to baseline ( [Table 4](#T4-nrp-14-606)). Significant session \u00d7 time period interaction effects on TST and MI were also observed (TST and MI, P < 0.01; respectively). Table 4 [Fig. 3](#F3-nrp-14-606)). Significant session \u00d7 time period interaction effects on SL and TC were also observed (SL and TC, P < 0.01; respectively). SFI did not have a statistically significant interaction effect (P > 0.05, [Fig. 3](#F3-nrp-14-606)). SE was statistically increased over baseline in FS (P < 0.01), while that of N-FS tended to decrease compared to baseline ( [Fig. 4](#F4-nrp-14-606)). A significant session \u00d7 time period interaction effect was also observed for SE (P < 0.01, [Fig. 4](#F4-nrp-14-606)). DISCUSSION [25](#B25-nrp-14-606)]. The current study examined the effects of sleep-inducing juice made of natural extracts on sleep quality and cardiac autonomic regulation in adults suffering from sleep difficulties. [26](#B26-nrp-14-606)]. Persons with poor sleep quality are also more likely to experience cardiovascular events due to autonomic imbalance. The cardiac sympathetic hyperactivity and parasympathetic withdrawal often observed in those with primary insomnia are warning signs indicating an increased risk of morbidity and mortality from CVD [ [27](#B27-nrp-14-606)]. [10](#B10-nrp-14-606)] and individuals suffering from primary insomnia [ [27](#B27-nrp-14-606)] may present with reduced nocturnal HRV due to autonomic imbalances defined as sympathetic hyperactivity and parasympathetic withdrawal. Studies on nocturnal HRV conducted by Tobaldini et al. [ [28](#B28-nrp-14-606)] demonstrated that poor sleep quality induced by pathological sleep conditions, such as sleep breathing disorders, could cause significant cardiac autonomic imbalances during sleep. However, since a standardized protocol for measurement of nocturnal HRV has yet to be established, the effects of sleep quality on cardiac autonomic regulation during night sleep tend to be inconsistent among studies. [10](#B10-nrp-14-606)] conducted a nocturnal HRV analysis based on TST starting one hour after bedtime and found that rMSSD and HF in HRV, measurements of vagal activity, were decreased in patients with CFS. Conversely, Manconi et al. [ [29](#B29-nrp-14-606)] investigated the influence of periodic leg movements during sleep on cardiac autonomic regulation and found no significant differences between patients with restless leg syndrome and healthy subjects for all nocturnal HRV indices. However, unlike Burton et al. [ [10](#B10-nrp-14-606)], Manconi et al. [ [29](#B29-nrp-14-606)] used only 5-min epochs of electrocardiograph signal during non-rapid eye movement sleep stage 2 when comparing differences in nocturnal HRV indices between groups. Another study by Manconi et al. [ [29](#B29-nrp-14-606)] also found no significant results associated with sleep disorders in cardiac autonomic regulation during sleep using 5 min periods of RR intervals in accordance with the standardized protocol for short term HRV analysis. While the different clinical and pathological features of participants may also affect results, HRV analysis protocol can have a significant impact on cardiac autonomic regulation profiles during sleep. The novel findings observed in this study regarding changes in HRV indices suggesting enhanced nocturnal cardiac vagal tone after sleep-inducing juice may be due to the HRV analysis protocol used. The current study used short-term HRV recordings at 7 time points at 30 min intervals starting one hour after bedtime to explore temporal changes in cardiac autonomic regulation during sleep following sleep-inducing juice intake. Parasympathetic activity is key to the induction and maintenance of sleep [ [10](#B10-nrp-14-606)], and HRV indices indicating increased parasympathetic activity during sleep suggest that sleep-inducing juice may contribute to improved sleep quality. [30](#B30-nrp-14-606)]. Since poor sleep quality may also lead to increased daytime sleepiness and fatigue, the FSS is used to assess subjective fatigue due to disrupted nighttime sleep [ [31](#B31-nrp-14-606)]. The results of the present study indicated that the 8-week intervention with sleep-inducing juice was associated with increased subjective sleep quality and decreased perceived fatigue levels. The PSQI has demonstrated high test-retest reliability and good validity in patients with primary insomnia [ [32](#B32-nrp-14-606)] and has also been used to identify the effects of intervention therapy on sleep quality [ [33](#B33-nrp-14-606)]. However, self-reported questionnaires introduce a certain amount of subjectivity due to differences in personal experiences and emotions. We thereby employed an objective data assessment technique to accompany self-reported estimations of sleep quality. [34](#B34-nrp-14-606)]. Actigraphy is closely related to subjective sleep quality and perceived fatigue and has been reported as useful in identifying whether an intervention improved nighttime sleep [ [24](#B24-nrp-14-606)]. Recently, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine Clinical Practice guidelines have suggested the use of actigraphy to assess certain sleep disorders such as insomnia, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, sleep-disordered breathing, hypersomnolence, and insufficient sleep syndrome [ [35](#B35-nrp-14-606)]. We thereby employed actigraphy to objectively detect potential effects of sleep-inducing juice on sleep quality. [12](#B12-nrp-14-606)] reported that TST and efficiency as measured by actigraphy were increased, including elevation of urinary melatonin after tart cherry juice intake. Tart cherry juice is known to have anti-oxidative stress and anti-inflammatory properties and high concentrations of melatonin [ [36](#B36-nrp-14-606)]. Melatonin produced by the pineal gland is critical to endogenous circadian clock regulation of the sleep-wake cycle [ [34](#B34-nrp-14-606)]. Thus, the increase of exogenous melatonin by tart cherry juice intake might have contributed to improvements in actigraphy sleep measures [ [12](#B12-nrp-14-606)]. [37](#B37-nrp-14-606)]. [37](#B37-nrp-14-606)]. Other studies have shown that individuals with shorter sleep durations also reported lower fruit and vegetable consumption and lower levels of associated biomarkers such as lycopene, vitamin C, total carotenoids, -carotene, and -carotene [ [38](#B38-nrp-14-606)]. The sleep-inducing juice evaluated in the present study was manufactured using fruits and vegetables as main ingredients, and increased synthesis of sleep-promoting hormones and changes in fruit and vegetable-associated biomarkers is to be expected from sleep-inducing juice consumption, and may be one of the mechanisms leading to the enhanced objective sleep quality assessed by actigraphy in this study. [39](#B39-nrp-14-606)]. [40](#B40-nrp-14-606)]. Thus, we do not think that the differences of water intake supplied to both groups have shown different patterns of sleep. Because, FS group only consumed 500 cc per day. In both group, there was no significant difference in body weight and body composition which affect sleep quality and quantity, as showed in [Table 1](#T1-nrp-14-606), during intervention as well. Moreover, with monitoring the confounding factors, such as caffeine intake, alcohol consumption, and physical activity including exercise, the experimental condition in this study was conducted with a strictly controlled experiment by crossover design. Behavioral and environmental recommendations for normal nighttime sleep indicate sleep hygiene improvements, while critical for promoting sleep, can also be used to treat mild or moderate insomnia. We examined the effects of sleep-inducing juice only, instructing participants to continue their usual lifestyle habits over the entire experimental period. "}
