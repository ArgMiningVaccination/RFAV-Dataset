In the first reverse sex discrimination case against the university, the union charged that Tufts is now paying maids and janitors equal salaries for unequal amounts of work. Vice President for Business Affairs John Mitchell explained that in the spring of 1974 the university studied its job descriptioons for janitors and maids. Finding, he said, that the differences in the responsibilities of the two jobs were minimal, the university decided to make the jobs even more comparable in that respect and also to equalize the pay for male and emale housekeepers . When the university decided to equalize the two job salaries last year, the all-male grounds nnd building union, Local 254, asked the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to rule that the maids must join their bargaining unit. But in the late fall of 1974 the NLRB decided that the maids could not be forced lo join thier union. The NLRB judge ruled that it was up to the maids to vote on whether or not they wanted to be in the union. Since prior to the NLRB ruling, the maids had voted not to join the union, the janitors took their grievance further. The janitors said that since the maids automatically receive equal salaries when the building services union bargains for raises or benefits, it is also bargaining for the maids. But, the janitors complain , the maids are not paying union dues. Thus the Building Services Employees Union Local 254 alleged that female housekeepers should have joined their union following the university 's decision to equalize their salaries. At this date, Mitchell said he did not know the present status of the union's grievance . He also said he hopes the case will be settled out of court shortly. Seven senators resign By JIM CAMPBELL The resignations of seven members of the Tufts Com\u00ad munity Union Senate were an\u00ad nounced at that body's first meet;ng Monday night. The graduation of two seniors, leaves of absences taken by three other senators, and resignations for \"personal\" reasons by two more brings the Senate's membership down from its original 29 to 22. Senior class representatives Rick Linde and Chester Smith were both elected for one semester last February .\u00b7 Their seats will be taken by two fresh\u00ad men students to be chosen in a September 29 election. Tri-Partite members Spiro Mitrokostas and Jose Giner both submitted their resignations , the latter to travel abroad. Senate Parliamentarian Steve Davis and Senator Skee O'Connell are both taking leaves of absence for the '75-'76 year, while Senior David Bianchi re$igned last semester . All seven vacancies , five on the Senate and two on the Tri\u00ad Partite, will be filled in the up\u00ad coming election. (S~ arrticle on priorities are made in the university budg~tar y procedures with the goal of holding down tuition.\" The Senate also heard its student representative lo the Executive Trustee Committee , Junior Fred Stern, announce that a mojor goal of the five student representatives lo the trustee committees will be to gain voling powers on those bodies. In the past, students have served on the trustees' Executive , Finance , Educational Policies, Resources , and Grounds and Buildings Committees only in an advisory capacity. Another objective called for by the Senate will be to examine the present method of handling TCU budgets and lo investigate TCU\u00ad f u n de d organizations ' organizational structures. The Senate voted to form a special committee to be named the \"Congress of TCU-funded Organizations.\" The Committee will \"closely examine the possibility of changing either the structure of the Senate or the method by Senate Vice-Chairperson Rob Lichtman (I.) and Chairperson Bill-O'Reilly. page .) At Monday's meeting , Chairman Bill O'Reilly an\u00ad nounced that a main goal of the Senate for the semester will be investigating the financial procedures of 'both its own Finance Committee and of the university budgetary process. The Senate passed a resolution that mandates the Senate Education and Administration Committees, the two student members of the Budget and University Priorities Student Faculty (\"Peter-Paul\") Com\u00ad mittee, and the student member of the Trustee Finance Com\u00ad mittee to \"investigate how Friday, Sept.ember 12, 1975 which organizations' budgets are approved\" in order to streamline the present time-consuming Senate budgetary procedure . The Committee will also look into the feasibility of shifting the burden of funding some activities to within the university budget or to winning additional financial support from the school, for groups such as athletic clubs. The Committee has also been asked to conduct a study of TCU organizations in order to possibly develop a \"standardized structure for charters for all TCU-funded organizations .\" This investigation comes partially in response to what O'Reilly called negative feeling about the Senate and the groups it funds (due to) the fact that many student organizations appear to be run and controlled by a few students. \" It was also announced Monday night that two students are serving on the Presidential Search Committee that is seeking a replacement for departing President Hallowell. O'Reilly and Junior Ellen Steuer will represent the student body on the Committee . Steuer has served on the Ad\u00ad vising and Counselling Com\u00ad mittee, was a member of the History Affairs Committee , and has been appointed by the Senate to the Student Faculty Ad\u00ad ministration Committee. The two student represen\u00ad tatives said they intend to \"distribute a questionnaire on a mass basis to solicit responses from students to discover what the major criteria should be for choosing a new President .\" It was also revealed that despite the Senate's concern for its financial plight last semester, there is a surplus of some $20,000 in the operating expenses budget of the TCU. The surplus resulted from unused funds returned by organizations , and an unex\u00ad pectedly large freshmen class which increases availalee revenues ._ The Senate decided that in order lo avoid the confusion lhal surrounded last year's Senior Week organization and funding, the Class of '76 will elect three of its class members in the up\u00ad coming election, who will be \"responsible for ensuring that members of the Senior class play an active role in planning Senior Week and Commencement Exercises .\" The elected seniors will work with Jack Salvatore inlhe planning of activities , and would solicit necessary funds from the Senate. In order to appear on the ballot, candidates must get twenty signatures from members of the Class of '76. Chairman O'Reilly read a letter stipulating the policy of the new Dean of Students, Tim Winant, regarding the continuing liquor licence controversy. The Dean's policy concerning the sale of liquor on campus without a licence is unchanged and thus is still prohibited . Dean Winant has been invited to the next Senate meeting, monday, to answer questions on his liquor licence policy. Observer New Dean of Students Thomas Winant. New dean of $tudents hides super powers By BETH WINSTEN The man currently occupying the dean of students office looks like mild-mannered Clark Kent. But he hasn't yet proved lo be a Superman . In his first two months on the Tufts campus, Thomas Winanl has been drowning in the liquor license issue. But despite the fact he has not been able to offer any sobering solution, he is as en\u00ad thusiastic about his new responsibilitie~ as a young child is on Christmas morning. Winanl came to Tufts\u00b7 July 28 after holding a number of position in both the social and academic affairs of university life. Most recently he was director of undergraduate residences as well as a lecturer in oriental studies at the University of Pennsylvania. Winanl, who succeeded James Steindler , said in an interview this week that his varied university experiences have prepared him for his new role of dean of students. \"I think universities like Tufts are very exciting places,\" said the 32-year-old bachelor, \"and having experienced both the ups and downs of being a student and a professor I can expect lo be doing much for Tufts.' Winant added that the excellent faculty and student body al Tufts will make his job much easier. \"I don't want lo be known as the campus disciplinarian \" he continued , \"By training I'm a scholar and by inclination I'm a liberal person, so if I spend my lime battling back and forth disciplinar y questions , I won't have time to accomplish much.\" Winant feels that one of the major responsibilities of his position is lo bring faculty and students closer together. He aid, \"Iif you complete your four years at Tufts without getting to know a faculty member or administrator well, it would be a shame.\" Three ways Winant sees to bring about faculty and student interaction are activities like the new freshman host program, classes held in residence halls, and faculty living in dormitories . Winant also noted that he is open to reasonable alter_natives on how to meet the problems of dorm security. \"I am working closely with the assistant dean of students Liz Toupin and the student labor manage F-of security on this problem,\" he said, \"so that students can talk to more than one person if they have ideas or questions. \" Although Winant is working more broadly on the security problem than the former dean did, he is handling the liquor issue in a similar fashion. In his statement on alcoholic beverages on campus, Winant said, \"the policy of the university as enforced b'y the dean of students remains unchanged from last year.\" \u00b7:_:;}}ess a proper license has been obtained from authorities in either Medford .>r Somerville , no charge may\u00b7 be made for ad\u00ad mission, tickets to be exchanged for drinks, or per drink, at any function held on the Tufts campus,\" he said. Winant added that students should not expect the university to overlook or encourage an activity that is in direct violation of the law. \"However \" he said \"I presume that the Tufts students are responsible persons who knowing that a particular activity is illegal will attempt to avoid it.\" \"Where individuals or groups make public their noncompliance of the law\" he continued \"they can expect appropriate measures to be taken to correct their behavior.\" But since Winant is so im\u00ad pressed with the high quality of students at Tufts, he does not forseee any major difficulties with the liquor license issue. Winant said, \"I was attracted to Tufts because I knew it was one of the best schools in the country and I was used to good schools.\" Winant has attended a number of American and Japanese universities and holds a~ bachelor 's degree in social studies education and a master's in Far Eastern history from New York University . He also holds a master's in Japanese history from Penn and is a candidate for a doctoral degree at that university .

White rehired by Tufts; Joost suffers set. back Tufts has been forced to rehire fine arts teacher Barbara White, while former fine arts teacher Christiane Joost-Gaugier has suffered a major set back, in summer developments regarding alleged sex discrimination at Tufts. The July 3 decision of United States District Judge Fi:ank Murray stated that the procedure used by Tufts to review White's 1972 tenure bid was \"suspect as to its freedom from sex bias influence , and its fairness,\" while Murray's ruling on Joost said that Tufts's failure to rehire her was based on professional considerations , and not sex discrimination as Joost had maintained . Murray noted that White's application for tenure was reviewed by a faculty committee which include!) Ivan Galantic, who was chairman of the fine arts department in the year before the Joost and White complaints . Galantic, Murray said, exhibited behavior showing \"sex bias toward women,\" and thus could hav influenced the faculty committee 's decision against White. \"No affirmative action was taken by the (Tufts) administration to replace Galantic on the subcommittee in the face of his expressed opposition to White's tenure and his rewtation for sex bias,\" Mu,rray wrote. Joost was dismissed -bf Tufts due to her failure to make progress toward her doctorate and due to the fact that \"lier performance as a scholar left much to be desired.\" l\\'!.irray said. ''While input from Galantic was received by Dean of Faculty Bernard Harleston , the ultimate decision not to rehire Joos! was made solely by Harl~ston, \u00b7 Lhe judge stated, while agreeing that Tufts could execute its decision as long as it wa:; not based on sex ciiscriminalion . Joost's opinion Jeanne Baker., Joost 's lawyer, reacted lo Lhe decision by saying, \"We are definitely moving ahead on this case, and are gearing up for a full trial on t.he merits.\" Baker charged that ''Judge Murray cut us off, and wouldn't listen to all the evidence we had. He made a fact fin\u00ad ding based on a very truncated record.\" She added, We are very opt1m1sl 1c that we'll be able to put in evidence specifically on the areas where he in\u00ad dicated he didn't think we'd proved our case.'' Over the summer, Joosl was able to obtain a new job as chairperson of the art department at New Mexico :state College. \"We feel very fortunate and relieved to be able to start a comeback The long and winding record of sex discrimination comelaints against Tufts saw several new developments over the past summer . One case was settled, two more took a major step toward settlement, one new one emerged (see story, page.. ), and one stood absolutely still. in her career just at the time when she would have suffered another setback,\" said Baker. In regard to White, Tufts Provost Kathryn McCarthy explained exactly what Murray's ruling means. \"We have\u00ad agreed to the condition that White teach and be paid the salary consistent with what she would have been paid had she been here since 1972,\" McCarthy said. White's reaction White, who returned to teaching at Tufts this past week, stated Tuesday _ that \"I certainly will carry on this case with the object of getting tenure and promotion to the rank of associate professor .'' Christiane Joost Barbara White I Salary discrimination: a settlement out of court By TEI) SCHACHTER \u00b7 One of the longest standing sex discrimination complaints against Tufts, that of assistant director of admissions : Alison Robart, was settled out of court May 13, 1975. Robart, who had originally ' filed her compaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission t t;t;UC) m j'\\Ugust, 1972, charged that Tufts had paid her less salary than a male who did he sarpe work but had less experience . The settlemerit _, as described by llobart, included \"a fairly substantial cash settlement for back pay and other incidentals, and an approximately ten percent salary increase to th.e level of my male counterpart in the admissions office.\" The case wasjsettled out of court through negotiations between attorneys for Tufts and Robart, after Tufts indkatf,!d to Robart that they no longer wished to work through the EEOC. Tufts had reques_ted this course after EEOC ruled in December , 1974/Jhat there was prQbable cause for a finding of sex discrimination by Tufts University against Robart in the matter of salary. Alter less than a month of actual negotiations , Tufts and Robart came to an agreement . Ho~ever, the class action section of Robart's complaint , in which she represented all; female admissions employees, has not been settled. Robart ex\u00ad pects that no futther action will be taken on that aspect of her complaint ; \"I can't push it anymore myself,\" she says. Alison Robart Lonnie Carton Robart did indicate, however, that the \u00b7university , in her repeatedly \"dawdled during the set\u00ad tlement process.\" \"It semed to take Tufts an awfully long time to settle this case\" she says. \"I often felt that Tufts was dragging its feet during the whole two and a half years this complaint was contested and negotiated .\" Tufts Provost Kathryn McCarthy, responding to Robart's allegations ,said \"It may seem that such cases are unnecessarily protracted . However, any evidence of discriminatory behavior and subsequent se~tlement must. examine not only the particular circumstance, but also the effect of the settlement on other persons in com\u00ad parable jobs in the university . It is not appropriate for a single settlement to sel up a chain reaction which bears no -'.~ relationship to discrimination, and might in fact contribute lo discriminatory behavior.\" Carton case remains at a standstill The one complaint against the university which did not. change in status over the summer was that of education instructor Lonnie Carton. Carton charged Tufts with breach of contract and with sex discrimination after she was denied tenure in 1974. \"I am very p1eased with Judge Murray's ruling,\" she added. Tufts President Burton Halowell issued the following statement , in response Lo Murray's ruling: \"In the Christiane Joost-Gaug1er matter, we are gratified by the court's decision to deny the motion for a preliminar y in\u00ad junction. In the Barbara White case we are pleased that we can now proceed with the trial on the merits. Sex discrimination h~s never been proven at Tufts University and we look forward in the upcoming trial on the merits to the opportunity to demonstrate that it is not an issue in this case.\" The next step in the sex discrimination suit filed by the EEOC on behalf of the two women will be a full trial on the merits of the ~ase. No date has yet been set for that trial. \"It may seem that such cases are unnecessarily protracted. However, any evidence of discrirni;natory behavior and subsequent settlement must examine not only the particular circumstance, but also the effect off the settlement on other persons in comparable jobs in the university.\" -Provost Kathryn McCarthy A temporary restraining order was granted against Tufts in August, 1974, by Judge Arthur Garrity, requiring the university Lo keep Carton as a teacher until the case is brought to a settlement. Carton taught at Tufts last year and is continuing to teach now under an ex: tension of that order. \"Until Garrity hears the case I'm on status quo, teaching and waiting,\" Carlon says. Provost Kathryn McCarthy agrees that nothing can be done until Garrity is free of his current responsibility to supervise Lhe busing of blacks and whites within Lhe city of Boston. \"Tufts is now working under an in\u00ad terrogatory, in which the plaintiff, Carlon. and the defendant , Tufts, gather such information as they need for presentation to a hearing,\" Mc\u00ad Carthy said. No dale has yet been set .for such a hearing. TED SCHACHTER .l'rlclar, Septanber 12, J~li Observer '\u00b7;> .. \\~\\' J, C, lalr '' Views of Barnum Hall: the first photo was taken on April 14, with local firefighters pouring water on the smoking ruins. The succeeding photos show the building in various stages of reconstruction. The bottom photo was taken two weeks ago. Page Sb: Barnum renovations: o~ly the beginning By GARY PALMUCCI and J.C. BAER Renovations on Barnum Hall, which was destroyed by fire on April 14 have progressed to the point where some classrooms are now being used and the entire facility is expected to be ready for use by January 1. Tufts has to date spent ap\u00ad proximately $249,000 in repairs on Barnum, home of the univer'iity's biology department , and on Dana Laboratories, which sustained relatively minor damage in the blaze. In addition, the university in July received a low-interest loan of $692,000 from. the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) to aid in Barnum's renovation . Local fire marshal Jt>hn Ambrogni , in a report filed last June, \u00b71abeled the fire's cause \"suspicious unknown\". Within days after the fire, university officials under the supervision of Director of Facilities Planning Laurence Ketchen had formulated both short-range and long-range plans for replacement of the building's facilities. The architectural firm of Kubitz & Pepi, which had done some previous construction work in Barnum, presented to the university several sketches for a new roof to be placed over each of the two wings of Barnum as well as a new structure to replace the building's badly damaged center section. While new steel roofing was placed over each wing in early June, no action has yet been taken to renovate the center sectio.1. The basement and first floors of each Barnum wing were cleared of all debris and repainted over the summer so that they would be ready for the start of classes this month. According to Ketchen , these facilities are just as good, if not better, than before the fire. LAB RECONSTRUCTION Still to be refurbished are the cat lab and the freshman lab, located in the west and east wings of Barnum, respectively . These labs suffered some 70-80 per cent damage in the blase. Ketchen pointed out a part of that dilemma yet to be resolved: the .reconstruction is scheduled to take place in the five weeks between this year's first and second semesters , during which the holiday periods would reduce the actual working lime to about three weeks. This is not enough time in that three week period to install thermostats , studs and new walling and to run up new water lines from the first floor. Factors of inclement weather might also hamper such a timetable. Ket\u00ad chen hopes that work on these sections will run through the first semester during hours that will least disturb classes and lab work on the lower floors. In the center section of Bar\u00ad num, walls that were judged structurally unsound, which included all walls on the upper floors, have been removed and a temporary roof put down. A corridor built through the center section now connects the two wings on the first floor. Ketchen would not estimate what the final insurance set\u00ad tlement might be. He said he is Observer waiting until the building's heat is turned on later in the semester so that any further structural damage can be ascertained. The university's insurance policy requires that Tufts pay the first $25,000 in damages for any fire and a premium of \"around $60,000 a year\", according to TU contoller Richard Thorngren . He also said that this insurance was automatically renewed over the .summer, but added that the in\u00ad surance companies still had the option to indicate any changes in the premium or the deductible rates. The approximately $249,000 which the university has thus far expen~ed on Barnum renovations breaks down roughly as follows: $175,000 for painting, alterations and repairs; $25,000 for steel roofing on the east and west wings; $50,000 for miscellaneous services and architectural and electrical work. Dana Laboratories, which suffered only smoke and water damage from the fire, is presently being Kathryn McCarthy which is composed of members of the biology \\faculty, administration, and faculty from the other un\u00ad dergraduate science depart\u00ad ments and the medical and dental schools. Provost McCarthy , along with DeBurlo, Ketchen, business affairs vice president John Mitchell and biology professors Benjamin Dane and Mary Ella Feinleib, traveled the country extensively over the summer to inspect recently-built science centers in other colleges and universities . RESEARCH SPACE SHORTAGE There has been talk among some university officials of moving the biology department's facilities into proximity with those of the engineering department.

HEW ASSISTANCE The.$692,000 loan was allocated through the disaster relief assistance program of a 1965 higher education law and is repayable in 30 years at a three per vent interest rate, according to vice president of planning and treasurer C. Russell DeBurlo. This rate is considerably lower than that offered at private banks. A bank charging the commer.cial rate on such a loan would require perhaps as much as 9 per cent for interest on a similar loan. DeBurlo called this loan \"just\u00b7 starter money. You've going to need a greater amount than just insurance benefits and govern\u00ad ment loans,\" He indicated that additional outside fundraising might be necessary to finance either a new building to replace Barnum or a complete renovation of the existing structure. In either case, DeBurlo said, the aim is to \"replace Barnum\" \u00b7 as it now exists, The vice president also said that such a project would be scheduled for completion in a minimum of two years and a maximum of \u00b7four. The exact nature of this reconstruction will be determined by a committee presently chaired by Provost Biology research space has been largely eliminated by the priorities for new classroom space in the aftermath of the fire. While administration and biology department officials presently seem content to let that situation linger, there has also been talk of building a new large lecture hall to accommodate students currently assigned to small classrooms which were formerly used as research areas. Cohen auditorium is presently being used for Biology 11-13, a large introductory lecture course, and its acoustics are reportedly better than were those in the now.gutted Barnum 28. A new 450-seat auditorium designed several \u00b7 years ago has already been given \"possibility\" status to several university departments in recent years. According to DeBurlo, \" a large lecture room will definitely be built in the future\", but whether as part of a new building or as a renovation in an older: one is still uncertain . Friday, Sept.ember 12, 1975 Chris Tsouros . Dukakis to Durkin By TED SCHACHTER Senior Chris Tsouros has a lot of faith in the American electoral system, and a lot of faith in Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis. Such faith has twice involved him in the Dukakis camp, and led him to the only major current political test in the nation-the New Hampshire Senate race. \"I wandered into the Dukakis cam\u00ad paign headquarters when Tufts canceled those two months in early 1974 because of the 'fuel crisis',\" TsouroHecalls . Soon he became a state-wide coordinator for publicity blitzes and an organizer of campaign workers, setting up three _personally delivered \"drops\" of' literature, each reaching over 1,000,000 voters across Massachusetts . Working for Dukakis under ex\u00ad McGovern regional manager Joe Grandmaison , Tsouros made the that helped him obtain another exciting job-as \"advance man\" for Dukakis over the past summer. \"Every time Dukakis left the state house, I had to be where he was going before he got there,\" explains Tsouros in his usual unassuming manner. \"I had to keep him on schedule.\" Tsouros was primarily responsible for making sure the planned event was actually occurring, providing Dukakis with advance information on wha\u00b7t kind of turnout and reception to expect, and being certain the governor had his speech or comments ready. \"It was a fantastic experience sitting with Dukakis in his car, driving around the state :Vith him, hearing him talk and question himself on certain issues and problems ,\" Tsouros recalls. Where'd the Hope Go? But what happened to the great hopes Dukakis evoked before he took office in January? Why are many of Dukakis' appointees \"spending much of their time ,racking paper clips\" as Tsouros sees it. Why is it true that the Governor 's ap\u00ad pointees \"simply aren't able to consider issues like energy alternative s and the 12.6 percent Massachusetts unem\u00ad ployment rate\"? But despite this budget mess, which he feels is hamstringing Dukakis, Tsouros' faith in the new governor' s sincerity leads him to expect a much more responsive and innovative ad\u00ad ministrati on in the future. \"These first two budgets will be very painful, as Dukakis tries to get the state lo live within its means once again,\" Tsouros feels. \"But I'm awfully op\u00ad timistic about the-next three years. I think he's done well considering the situation he's inherited .\" \"In about a year, when they_ stop having to deal with 'nuts and bolts' budget problems , you're going to see some really creative government coming out of the Dukakis administration . The reason I'm so hopeful is because. the people he's got around him are very sharp. They're stifled now by the budget problem, but I'm sure they'll hang in there and emerge with some great ideas,\" Tsouros says. Wyman-Durkin A political science major who plans to go on to law school after graduating Tufts, Tsouros is spending much of his time\u00b7now commuting.each day to and from Salem, New Hampshir e, where he works in the campaign of Senate hopeful John Durkin. The Durkin --Wyman election of November , 1974, ended in a virtual dead heat. After New Hampshire state authorities came to contradictory decisions as to who won the battle, the election was turned over lo the United States Senate for adjucication . Because the Senate is strongly Democratic , Wyman, fearful of a negative decision, appealed for a new election to \"restore the choice of their Senator to the people of New Hamp\u00ad shire.\" Durkin, encouraged by the 63-36 Democratic advantage in the Senate, wanted to let the Senate follow the law and decide a winner after a careful recount. But followint the waste of over a half-year of Senate time, and $7,000,000 in taxpayer's money, with no resolution in sight,.. Durkin gave in to the ine1itable and called for a new election. The 45-day campaign began on August 2. Durkin had been his own campaign manager in the original election, but now Grandmaison was helping him out, and Chris TsQuros rejoined his old boss. \"This is a classic Democrat versus Republican fight, says Tsouros, who has affected Ivy League attire in his new position. \"Durkin, the pro-consumer , pro-labor liberal, is opposed by Wyman, the conservative , funded by big business and their interests.\" The campaign is tinged by a hangover that many Republicans will be (facing) for quite a while: Watergate . Wyman, by some accounts,. was the middleman in one of the celebrated Nixon ad\u00ad ministration sales of ambassadorships in exchange for campaign contributions . This issue has (apparently) hurt Wyman deeply in the moderate wing of his party. Tsouros has been assigned to organize the Salem area for Durkin; his respon- CSL hears appeal The Committee on Student Life (SCL)\u00b7 Monday upheld its one-year suspension of a student who had been dismissed last spring for puncturing a tire of a car parked on campus. The student, who was to be a senior this semester, had appealed the CSL's decision on the basis that he had con\u00ad tracted a disease which impaired his sight and was physically unable to perform any regular employment. He thus felt that being allowed to return to school now was his only practical alternative. The CSL upheld his suspension for the present semester and then voted to reconsider his case in December ,. CSL chairman Walter Swap said that the committee would then vote on whether 1 to reinstate the student for the spring term. The student had previously been placed on permanent disciplinary probation by the CSL (which he could not appeal) for his role in an altercation with several gay students last April. During a CSL hearing on this case, the student's mother, against his will, had entered the hearing room. The student then bolted from the room and was found the next day by Tufts police puncturing a car tire with a tire iron. CHRIS TSOUROS ... predicting a Durkin win sibilities include seven towns and 12 percent of the 1974 vote. \"The key in this election is turnout\" he says. \"The polls indicate another dead heat, so Wf just have to get a lot of voters to the polls, as many Democrats and independents as we possibly can.\" With that goal in mind, Tsouros hopes to move enough new voters to increase his area's vote by three or four points to 15 or 16 percent of the state total. Another man understand s the goal of higher turnout-President Ford. To that end, he toured New Hampshire yester\u00ad day in an effort to win wavering Republicans and undecided independen ts to the Wyman side. Whether or not he was successful in this significant test of vole-gathering power, will be a key in\u00ad dication of the President 's chances in a prospective New Hampshir e primary fight next March. Ronald Reagan, Ford's potential op\u00ad ponent in such a Republican primary, has also appeared for Wyman in what is probably the first confrontation the two national Republican leaders had had . Reagan has not yel announced for Ford's office, but it is expected he will declare his candidacy before Christmas . Despite the presence of the Republicans' big guns, Tsouros still sees candidates themselves as being the decisive factor in this campaign . \"Ford will help Wyman, no doubt,\" he believes. \"But Durkin is taking the position that Ford should come, and try to explain to New Hampshire voters why he has vetoed the job bill, raised energy prices, and done so little about this recession .\" Shenanigans One of the most peculiar political in\u00ad stitutions in the United States has had a major influence in the New Hampshire election. William Loeb's Manchester Union-Leader has supported the Republican Wyman in typically no-holds\u00ad barred style. Loeb, who published the fake 1972 letter that played a large part in undermining Edmund Muskie's presidential campaign, recently printed another sensational letter, replete with profane and fecal references to Louis Wyman. Loeb described the letter as being typical of Durkin support. Whether or not this letter is similar in origin to the Muskie letter has yet to be determined. Tsouros feels that such tactics will not win Wyman any more votes than \u00b7 he .already has. \"Grandmaison lias always told us to read the Union-Leader , then put it down, take a deep breath and not leUt effect our decision-making process,\" he says. Despite Loeb's shenanigans , Tsouros sees ;\u00b7a Durkin victory by three to five percentage points\" in the September 16 election . The electoral system Aft.er working in the Dukakis and Durkin campaigns , as well as in George McGovern 's 1972 presidential campaign, Tsouros has done a lot of thinking about the American electoral process. \"Frankly , I don't know of another system of choosing leaders that doesn't have the same inadequacies , or just as many new inadequacies ,\" he says. \"I really don't know how you could set up a better system.\" Tsouros gives cam1;>aign reform little faith as he ponders improving the electoral process. \"The old laws were broken,\" he points out, \"and there's no rea\u00b7son to believe the new ones can't be. aws just further define the rules of this game-but people still cheat at the game.\" He adds, \"I have become a little cynical as I see people taking power who shouldn't have it, and are totally unequipped for holding it. The fact that a dozen or so organizers can have such a disproportionate effect on the power processes in this system is not what I learned in high school texts about the one-man, one-vote ideal.\" But either (you're) a participant or not a participant in choosing the people who lead us, says Tsouros, and 'I have chosen to participate .\" Just a small measure of his success will be determined next week in New Hampshire .

Frlday,;Sept.ember 12, 19'ffl arts from Tufts to Boston h i I I and hub By JEFF KINDLER BLGHT ON THE HLL: The new paint job, signs, and land\u00ad scaping at the Tufls Arena Theater might be simply \u00b7 evidence of a spirit of welcome for the many visitors who wat\u00ad ched this summer's two specially commissioned Bi'centennial plays (see story, page 10). But some members of the community, wise to clear administration signals, are suggesting thaL the fix-up work indicates a resignation to the drama department's more or less permanent residence in their ramshackle Arena and its surrounding $40,000 collapsible bubbles. Apparently , the huge arts center that was designed and planned over six years ago at a. preconstruction cost nearing $100,000 will remain merely an expensive and artful blueprint. Ironically, while this cyear the government loaned the school $700,000 to rebuild burnt-up Barnum and three national foundations kicked in about $200,000 to improve the lab facilities in the Chem building, Tufts has only been able to raise $15,000 since 1970 toward tne $3.5 million Arts Center which, in\u00ad cidenlly, would now cost more than four million. We're reminded of the sorrowful utterance of a drama major as he watched Jumbo's trunk crumble into ashes during that fateful night last spring: \"I knew those scientists would find a way to keep us in that barn.\" TUFTS IS HARTER:Aslride a hill in a little town outside Boston sits a liberal arts institution called Harter College whose coed campus includes such attractions as Professor's Row and Greek Way as well as the stuffed remains of a giant elephant left by a circus owner named Bailey. The school, which may be dimly recognizable to Medford residents , is the setting of Louise Blecher Rose's The Launching of Barbara Fabrikant , a 1974 ac\u00ad count (the word \"novel\" would imply fiction too generously) of a young girl's freshman year in college It takes place in 1961,the year of Rose's admission to Jackson, and describes, often wittily, the heroine's suffering at the hands of her detested school and parents and her rather oversexed poli sci teacher.' Before you begin your own Friday, Sept.ember 12, 1975 academic misery full-gear , you might consider wasting a few hours pleasantly with this book, of for no other reason than to see how things\u00b7 have changed (and how they haven't) in 14 years. The Fawcett Crest paperback , issued last month, is available for $1.75. PUMPERNCKEL Wl'H NUTS: A more productive use of time may be an hour and a half spent at the Central Square Cinema on Mass. Ave. where The King -of Hearts begins the fifth year of its Cambridge run. Set in World War One, Phillipe De Broca's\u00ad delightful and touching story features Alan Bates as a Scottish soldier lamely trying to rescue a small French village from a German bomb hidden in the town/ square. In the process, \"Pum- pernickle,\" as he is mistakenly called by his superiors, ac\u00ad cidently looses the inhabitants of the local lunatic asylm including the ravishing Genevieve Bujold. The 1967 film is a thoughtful and entertaining experience that begs viewing; ask any of the many area poeple who have seen it dozens of limes. RATHER GENEROUS: After his highly successful appearance here last spring, Dan Rather, the famed CBS reporter who covered the decaying Nixon White House, was so impressed by the people to he met and the response he got that he donated a hundred dollars the school library.His check, made out almost immediately after his departure, was used to buy many needed political science books, especially for the new \"Politics and the Media\" class, the only significant jour\u00ad nalism course at Tufts. THEY AIN'T HEARD NOTHING YET: If you think you can sing like Al Jolson ( and who doesn't?) then you might be good for 50 bucks.To promote their Sept. 24 grand re-opening of the 1927 Warner Brothers ' classic, The Jazz Singer, the Sack theaters are sponsoring a Jolson sound\u00ad alike contest. Preliminary judging will be held al the Bicentennial Pavillion at the Pru on Saturday , Sept. 20 from eight to ten in the morning . Anybody is eligible; you've got three minutes to sing an A. J. song of your choice. They'll provide the musical accompaniment \u00b7and pick ten finalists to compete for the five $50 prizes. That com petition will be held at seven p. m. on the 24th at Cinema 57 where later that evening the first sound film will begin its new Boston engagement. Anyone who shows up with a 78 rpm recording of the film's star will be admitted free that night. And you don't' even have to walk a million miles. GET DRUNK WHLE YOU CAN: \"The First and Final Fling,\" Tufts Social Committee 's opening bash tonight in Jackson Gym, is so named because the Senate would only give TSC money for one party this year. Chris Morse, committee chair\u00ad person, says the Senate won't fund parties that give out free booze-a procedure made nec\u00ad cessary by the school's lack of a liquor permit. Therefore , says Morse, the committee \"will become defunct\" after tonight's party which begins at 8;30 p. m. unless there is a change in school or Senate policy. Tonight's band, by the way, is called \"Good Thunder \" and is composed of people who have played with the likes of Dave Brubfck, Maria Muldaur, and the Detroit Sym\u00ad phony. Free beer and champagne P.J.mch will be served and a Tufts I.D. card is required . 'Born to run\u00b7': new Springsteen disc By GEORGE KALOGERAKIS ON THE HLL: If you're missing the fine arts department , its , because they've moved t.o a previously vacant house at 11 Talbot Ave. (across the street from Cohne Auditorium) . They can be reached at X281 or 396. The music department has expanded its Cohen offices to include f.a.'s former spot. .. Just about anything you can say in three to five minutes will be recorded and aired by WMFO (91,5 FM) in its new public access program . Their phone is 625-8566 and their offices and studios are in Curtis Hall ... The music department will give you half of a course credit and a good time if you play in one of their small ensembles. Oboes and bassoons , as well as people who play them, are particularly needed in the chamber music program . Con\u00ad tact Peter Cokkinias in Room 7 A of Cohen. It's unfortunate that Bruce Springsteen 's many talents can't all be captured on vinyl. One would like to be able to play his albums and feel the same exhiliration thah one feels at his concerts. Springsteen 's new release, Born to Run, is as suc\u00ad cessful an allempt at blurring the line between concert and studio . performances as can be expected and will have to suffice until Bruce records a live album. On Born to Run Springs! een has sacrificed thP, more melodic style of The Wild, thelnnocentand the E Street Shuffle in favor of simple, driving riffs that are occasionally reminiscent of the record review Who. Two softer tunes and typically fine lyrics contribute some welcome subtlety to all that raunchiness. A relatively subdued number, \"Thunder Road,\u00b7 opens the album. It is immediately clear that Sprin'gsteen 's lyrics are as good as ever. He can create remarkably vivid images and is at once rough-edged and com\u00ad passionate . Listen: Don't run back inside Dar:ling you know just what I'm here f\\lr - Torn Ticket's fall production is Sweet Charity which will be performed in Cohen during the last weekend of 0ctober. Shown above are six veteran stalwarts in Beth Tanner's of previous T.T. sliows, performed during orien\u00ad tation.

So your scared and you're thinking That maybe we ain't that young anymore Show a little faith, magic in the night there's You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright .. Oh. and that's alright with me. \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\" follows, a catchy uptempo tune that features the Brecker Brothers on horns. Randy Brecker also contributes a mellow trumpet on \"Meetin~ Across the River,\" a beautiful song that proves Springsteen is not, as the ads for his album saf, a ''prisoner of rock 'n' roll.\" Yet rock n' roll dominates the album. \"Backstreets ,\" \"Born to Run\" and the lengthy \"Jungleland \" are all destined to become crowd-pleasers at future Sppringsteen concerts . His singing is sometimes hoarse, particularly on \"Backstreets ,\" which is slightly annoying at first but ultimately enhances the -urgency of the lyrics. Springsteen 's E Street Band, Pasily one of the best in the business , is highlighted by Clarence Clemons . Clemons is a versatile musician whose soaring saxophone has done much to create Springsteen's distinctive sound. Roy Biltan has adequately replaced David Sancious on piano-by no means an easy taks-and Max M. Weinberg is the new drummer . The remainder of the band is much as it was on the first two albums, with Springsteen again handling all the guitar work. Born to Run has a flaw, then it lies in a basic lack of diversity in the songwriting' . For this reason, . E Street Shuffle is a more in\u00ad teresting album, although it merely hints at Springsteen 's potential as a performer . Born to Run al least comes closer to suggesting that potential. Yet no \u00b7 mere album, no matter how . inspired, can ever do justice to a i performer of Bruce Springsteen's , caliber. PageNlne the arts; Summer productions weakened by scripts By JIM DILLON One is a drunkard and emerges as a heroic anti-hero-Ryan Cunningham . The other is a British deserter torn between loyalty to the uniform of the redcoat he was and the feelings he holds to the soil of his adopted land-Will Purvianc e. These were the two protagon ists who stood out against the backdrop of historical detail and technical authenticity oi\u00b7 \"This Boston Tumult.\" By mo'>t 5tandards Tufts' Summer Theater production of these two original bicentennial works was a relative artistic success. Un\u00ad fortunately, considering all last spring's worthy hopes of these plays laking their place in per\u00ad manent American repertoire , the two plays, Dennis McIntyre's Ryan's Yorktown Tune and James Forsvthe's Lobsterback . were disappointing to this summer's theater-goers. characters and their ideas. As a result, in Lobsterback's opening for instance, Forsythe has an eloquent but wordy James Olis engaging his contemporaries in the rhetoric of the day, which becomes more like a cram course in history than an actu,;11 dramatization. McIntyre sidestepped this particular trap, only lo have a Cunningham haunted and con\u00ad trolled by his equally detailed circumstances of debt and drink. Ryan's characterization never recognizes the magnitude of events that occur both in his domestic life and in the Boston about him. Even when he is caught smuggling \u00b7weapons, he thinks only in terms of his im\u00ad media I e failure,' afterwards perhaps, considering the treachery involved-but never its full significance. Lobsterback. Here the audience had to contend with a rambling, half-insane James Otis being, without warning, resurrected from the first act. Again, the character serves as a moralizing finger pointed at the audience. But viewers were unable to grasp what was essentially a ghostlike figure; if you blinked he might have disappeared for the lack of characteral continuity. Yet these !ines stand out as the loftiest, best-written imagery in the whole play. Unfortunately, according to Collins, \"The Otis character became irrelevant after his first scene. The audience didn't care that he loses his sanity in the\u00b7 first act. He never became as fully integrated into the script as James and Ihad wished.\" He then added, \"We were fascinated by him as a historical figure. There is alway's danger in that fascination .\" The intenlio\u00b7n was lo com\u00ad memorate the people and events I hat brought about the revolution. Bolh plays attempted to pare dmrn to lhe bones all the myths surrounding the motley revolutionary mob and their uniformed adversar ies, en\u00ad dowing obscure figures with flesh and blood, with fear and hope as !heir emotions. Technically, the Summer Theatre's effort was superb. Mary Harkins' costuming ac\u00ad curately defined the characters from whore lo general. Lighting, by Curl Senie, was painstakingly Anti-heroes aren't deeply motivated ; they just muddle through one scene after another. Both playwrights, of course, wrote into their scripts characters who stood for higher ideals. Lobsterback's Ebeneezer Mcblosh stood for the visions of a free government of the future to be formed after the struggle. Forsythe was successful in playing Purviance off of Mein Losh. Our man in the middle wished only to be left alone to ti,11 the soil, to work with something tangible . And the aud~ence sensed that this was powerful stuff. Ryan, however, stood for himself, a flask in hand, fearful of being recaptured. The irony is Perhaps now that this road has been travelled , the powers that be should consider something along the lines of a contemporary parallel, at least something that doesn't suffer as much in the jump of two hundred years. After all, Boston is still with us and tyrants abound. Might not next summer's productions deal with present-day Cunninghams or Purviances ? There seem to be some of these around, a,so. Patsy Culbert as Mercy Vose and Scott Taylor as Will Purviance attempt romance in a troubled time in James Forsyth's \"Lobsterback.\" \u00b7shakespeare colllpany grows out of Tufts Arena work By PAUL PALMER September 18 marks a theatrical event which promises to be something of a landmark for Boston and one of particular interest to the Tufts community. On that date, the infant Boston Shakespeare Company will make their debut, becoming the area's only\u00b7 regional dramatic em\u00ad semble devoted to a classical repetoire . The first play that they have chosen to tackle is The ,.y ... 1 Tempest , which significantly was produced by many of the same people three years ago in the Tufts Arena Theater. 4:\"\" At.r -~ Ryan Cunningham (Tom Thompson) is beset by his reciminating wife, Christie (Amy Van\u00ad Nostrand) in Dennis McIntyre's \"Ryan's Yorktown Tune.\" exact and sometimes, in a subtle way, the mood-setter for a given scene, but the Arena allowed itself to be overcrowded by otherwise effective Michael Anania sets. Harry Ritchie and Sherwood Collins, directors of Ryan's and Lobsterback , respectively, took good advantage of its unique view of the assortment of seductions, passions and gestures of the time. In fact,the acting,especially Tom Thompson as Ryan and Scott Taylor as Will Purviance, was quite good as well. The problems were in the plays themselves. The lasting theatrical value of any play rests primarily on the strength of its main charac\u00ad terizations and on how well they relate to the storyline. Because McIntyre and Forsythe were writmg period drama, at best nearly impossible to do well, they had to make necessary ex\u00ad pository introductions to Page Ten the Purviancee dies a melodramatic death while Ryan just fades into the epilogue. Both Forsythe andMclntyre used scenes at the end of their plays that took dead aim at America two hundred years later and at their audiences . There was a missing of the mark. Ryan and his cohorts abruptly freeze in their raiding of British supplies as his mistress (and we are left to wor:ider why her) comes into view in\u00b7 a spotlight. She delivers . a stirring speech complete with a patriotic tune on a soundtrack (or did we just imagine that?). McIntyre pufls up his period play stakes-and tries to place them\u00b7 into a contemporary ground. But it is too sudden, having nothing really to lead up to it. Collins considers the shift \"anti-climactic.\" \"James didn't realize that he had ended his play the scene before.\" The drama professor had more to say about the play he himself directed William Cain, Janet Buchwald , and Norman Frisch, board members of the newly\u00ad incorporated company , refer to that particular play as the culmination of work at Tufts which lead, nowever circuitously, to the formationof the new troupe. The Tempest staged here was both a controversial and a demanding play, according to Gain, who directed it as a master's thesis. It resulted in such a degree of cohesiveness among those involved that they kept in touch in the intervening years. The final decision to start out in their own company came this year when, encouraged by Buchwald, Cain wrote lo a number of people with whom he had worked in theater in the past. There was, he says, \"an over\u00ad whelming I y affirmative response.\" \"People really do want to work in theater,\" Cain added, referring to the \"astonishing\" sacrifices which some have made to join them.On the basis of this response, the group was con\u00ad vinced that if _they could find a theater, they could make it work. Observer They found it and now they are making it work. Cain finds their current production of The Tempest \"very different\" from the show he directed at Tufts. He attributes .this change primarily to the transition from the small \"cozy\" Arena to the radically new performing situation at their new location at the corner of Berkeley and Marlborough streets, with all of its unusual demands . But however different in conception, The Tempest would weem to be an appropriate beginning for their new project. \"A play about playing,\" as Cain calls it, it suggests the self\u00ad awareness and the sense of theatricality which may prove to be the hallmark of the Boston Shakespeare Company . Al. present, plans are for a season of three or four plays to be performed in repertory . The Comedy of Errors will be added as the second production in November and a third, un\u00ad nannounced play will enter the repertoire in January. That third one, according to Norman Frisch, \"could be one of our own.\" Frisch's first play (Threeplay) was produced in the Arena during his sophomore year at Tufts. A plea for assistance sent to friends, relatives, and teachers resulted in a working budget adequate for their initial needs and The Tempest, consequently , will not be marred by the financial limitations which so consistently plague other small theater groups. Quite the con\u00ad trary, with costumes by former Tufts costumer-lecturer Mary Harkins (now with Emerson) and sets by Michael Anania, who created the sets for both of this summer's bicentennial plays at' the Arena ( as well as for the now\u00ad famous Al Pacino Richard III of four years ago), their technical sophistication seems assured. On a more personal level, there is a high degree of commitment, of common objective and ex\u00ad perience among these people which constantly reflects in their vision of the new company . As performers, they find in Shakespeare not only a literature of theater, but an approach to it as a living art. With charac\u00ad teristic enthusiasm , Cain ex\u00ad plains: ''The fact of Shakespeare .. .is astonishing . The man wrote astonishing plays and he wrote them for a very specific company over a period of 20 years.\" He emphasizes the importance of the individual members of the company to Shakespeare as a playwright and how their unique talents in\u00ad fluence his work. As the most familiar example of this relationship , he cites the loss if Shakespeare 's most famous Elizabethan clown, Will .Kemp, whose replacement by Robert Armin, the creator of Touchstone, may explain the Bard's trend toward wiser fools. \"Essential to the type of theater that Janet, Norman, and I are involved in,\" he con\u00ad tinues,\"is the idea of company . People working together in an ongoing way. Shakespeare gives us ... almost three dozen plays which a. company can attack.\" And this particular company combines a wide range of ex\u00ad perience in theater with a broad spectrum of performing skills\u00ad some outside the traditional scope of \"acting.\" Their credentials include such diverse groups as the New Jersey (Continued on page 11) Friday, September 12, 1975 \\. \u00b7tile arts Boston Shakespeare (Continued from page 10) Shakespeare Festival and lhe Royal Liechlenslein Circus, with various familiar names in bet\u00ad ween. Company members in-\u00b7 elude former Camilla Brooks, Lynn Torgove , and Francis \"Mickey\" Culver. Instead, they find their Tem\u00ad pest at the very roots, in lhe poetry, the comedy, and the \"word-movement-myth\" of Shakespeare's work. And there is one more important element, the Italian Commedia dell'arte, the highly physical, improvisatory \"actor's theater\" which is where, Cain notes, \"Shakespeare learned his comedy.\" The syn\u00ad thesis aims at a very lively and joyous kind of performance and all agree lhat those who only look upon Shakespeare as \"something you read in school\" may be surprised by their work. The Tufts Concert Board for 1975-6: From left to right, back: John \"Ewal\" Coyle, Joel Bresler, Rob Ames; front: Jon Tisch, Jack Salvatore, Larry Oshin. Their hope is to spark lhe public's imagination through an unusual diversity of resources , showing them a Shakespeare quite different from his un\u00ad fortunately dusty and academic image. The solution is what Buchwald characterizes as a \"vibrant\" production, a modern look at an old play. Rather than creating a museum piece, lhe Boston 'Shakespeare Company aims al a more organic treat\u00ad ment, resulting in a viable theatrical event for a con\u00ad temporary audience . To illustrate the distinction Cain refers to the taditional concept of Ariel in The Tempest as an actor dressed in feathers \"who walks on the balls of his feet.\" To him, this is a superficial and inadequate interpretation of the part. While this is a significant goal, it is not the essence of lhe Boston Shakespeare Company . The essence is the desire of many different people to do good theater in their own way. And love of the art, in all of its aspects, has brought them .to Shakespeare as the focus of their work. Perhaps Norman Fi::isch puts their motivation most succinctly when he says: TCB plans three By GARY PALMUCCI concerts The TCB's current \"Through Shakespeare we find we can explore a lot of things in ourselves as directors and designers and managers and actors that keep the theater alive.\" A rejuvenated Tufts Concert Board (TCB) is planning three on-campus concerts for the semester as well as a poll to determine students' musical and locale preferences.

TSC chairperson Chris Morse is no longer a member of the board.

He filed his case with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD), citing a 1972 state law that stated, among other things, \"It shall be an unfair educational practice for an educational institution ... to exclude, limit, or otherwise discriminate against any person seeking admission to a program or course of study leading to a degree, beyond a bachelor's degree, because of age.\" \"I chose to sue Tufts instead of the other 12 schools for s!!veral reasons,\" sayd Sullivan . \"First of all, Massachusetts does have this law, which apparently is not on the books in the states of the other schools to which> I applied.\" \"Second, as opposed to the other school I applied to in Massachusetts, Tufts knew me very well, knew my particular strengths beyond what could be written in an appication . Tufts' Frij)ay, Sept.ember 12, 1975 discrimination coulct Up until at least the 1968-69 TUSM catalogue, says Sullivan, the following .;tatement was printed by Tufts: '\"Applicationls over 28 years of age ... are not usually considered favorably by the committee (of admissions) .\" By the time of Sullivan's rejection, the catalogue read, \"There is no geographic quota and no discrimination because of race, creed, color, or sex.\" This year, over two years after lhe Massachusells Legislature passed lhe age discrimination law, and Sullivan's original key additional word: \"age.\" Lawyer Lamson believed that when the evidence against Tufts was added up, probable cause for a complaint to the MCAD could be found. When, in the early days of August, 1974, Sullivan received his final rejection from Tufts, Lamson filed his client's compalint. The commission found in April, 1975, \"probable cause to credit the allegation that the complainant was denied ad\u00ad mission to an educational institution because of his age,\" the \"complainant\" being Sullivan, and the \"educational institution\" being Tufts. According to the law, as explained by Jeffrey Huvelle, a lawyer for MCAD, \"after a probable cause decii,ion, we are required to try to settle the case without a hearing, and to try to work out an acceptable agreement with both parties.\" But, continued Huvelle, Tufts declined lo discuss working out an agreement. Meanwhile, Curtis was making charges against sullivan, in court af\u00ad fidavits, lo a newspaper called The Chronicle of Higher Education , and in conversations with MCAD lawyers. Sullivan denounces these charges, especially those in the Chronicle ar\u00ad ticle, as being \"damaging to my reputation , not to mention being un\u00ad i rue.\" In conversation with an investigator from the MCAD, Curtis said Sullivan could not be accepted into Tufts Medical School becaw,e of \"his ex\u00ad tensive psychiatric record and because he was in quite a bit of group therapy.\" Sullivan's reply to this claim is unequivocal. \"I have never seen, in any form, al any time, a psychiatrist , psychologist , or social worker for professional dealing of any sort.\" \"This,\" he adds, \"is _...a completely unwarranted statement.'' The MCAD accepted Sullivan's stand on this particular issue when he offered to produce his presumably blank psychiatric record for the comm1ss1on. As Lamson said, \"It would seem to be a silly stance for a medical school to deny admission on the basis of a psychological record of any sort, considering that they're probably training psychiatrists themselves .\" Observer Another charge made by Curtis, published in the August 18, 1975, issue of The Chronicle of Higher Education, is that Sullivan was \"non-productive in the activities for which he was hired, namely research , \"and that this was lhe reason he was dismissed from the Tufts faculty in 1974. Sullivan responds by noting that, from the start, he took an unusual load of courses lo teach, doing what he calls \"a very disproportionate amount of leaching \" in the biochemistry department at TUSM. Sullivan also points out that \"the slated reason for my dismissal as contained in a letter from ex-Dean of Personnel Maloney, was the difficult financial situation anticipated by Tufts University School of Medicine in the coming year.\" The dismissal , ac\u00ad cording to Sullivan, had nothing of\u00ad ficially to do with anything but lack of seniority and a budget squeeze. Curtis also claimed, in conversation with an MCAD lawyer, that Sullivan acted \"in such an irrational manner\" when talking to Curtis about the case that he was afraid Sullivan would slash the tires of his car. In\u00b7 addition, Curtis asserted in his June 25, 1975, affidavit to the Suffolk County Superior Court, Sullivan had \"engaged in disruptive and threatening behavior which made many people question his stability and suitability for (Continued on page 1:1) Meal tax may up student hoard plan-Jee By ANDREW LIEBMAN Tufts students may have to pay an additional 40 dollars for their fall 1975 meal plans unless the Massachusetts legislature exempts private colleges and universities from the state meal tax. Described by Tufts vice\u00ad president John Mitchell as \"one more nail in the coffin of private education,\" the meal tax, a statewide excise tax on meals and beverages , will, if enforced, escalate the cost of meal plans here by eight percent. Tuesday, Ballou hall learned of the state's intention to enforce this tax through a memorandum from the Association of In\u00ad dependent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts (AICUM) . AICUM advised Tufts and all other private colleges and universities in Massachusetts that they \"should make plans to collect and pay the tax which is effective Sept. 1, 1975.\" Upon receipt of AICUM's message, Tufts president _ Burton C. Hallowell pleaded in a telegram to Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis for a delay of the tax until January, 1976. This would allow Tufts to in\u00ad form its students of the increase and make it unnecessary for the university to send an additional bill to those who have already paid for the fall meal plan. The delay would also provide ad-ditional time for an exemption amendment to pass through the legislature . AICUM's memorandum, however, was not an official state notification; it was more a for\u00ad warning that the meal tax's application to the university could become a reality at any moment. In all likelihood , according to Mitchell, \"the tax commissioner wouldn't even know how AICUM got a hold of the ruling. Although the document was signed by the tax and corporations com\u00ad missioner and dated Aug. 1, 1975, it has yet to be publicly released. Historicall y, Tufts has simply neglected its responsibility for paying the meals tax over the past few years. The meals tax , which was first levied in 1941 to raise revenue for assisting the aged, provided for a five percent excise tax on all meals and beverages whose total exceeded one dollar. Over the years, the lax became a general revenue tax and the five percent figure was sub\u00ad sequently increased by the legislature early this summer to eight percent. But at the time when the bill was originally written, the cost of university board plans averaged far less than one dollar per meal. With the recent inflation-elevated cost of food and food services, average meal costs have ex\u00ad ceeded the one dollar-per-meal limit. Where the colleges and universities were once automatically exempted , now they are being called upon to pay the tax as well. from the meals tax is in the process of consideration by the Senate Ways and Means Com\u00ad mittee. Until the legislature completes the new state budget for 1975-76-a fiscal year which is already two months old-the bill will probably not be considered . Whether the legislature will add priv.ate universities and colleges to the list of exempt organizations is not at all certain. \"Obviously this is the very worst year in a decade to be :suggesting : that a tax exemption be granted when the state is undergoing such fiscal panic,\" Mitchell noted. \"But the bill proposing exemption,\" he added, \"is still in the legislature . It's not shot down yet.\" It's certain, Mitchell said, that the additional cost of meals here will have a great effect on the ability of families. to afford the cost of a year at Tufts. \"We're worried the effect on individual wil families will be monstrous,\" he said. Administrators on the hill appear befuddled over how such a ruling could come into effect after the school term has begun. Mitchell feels -that, as the bill stands now, Tufts must pay the tax. The university must sit and wait for a definitive statement from the state capital on whether or not any new exemptions will be added to the tax. Until such a time, preparations for the im\u00ad plementations of the tax seem to be inevitable . The meal this man is preparing ... At present, an amendment to the list of organizations exempt ... will probably cost these people more soon. Age discri1nination: _ the s\u00b7ullivan case ... (Continued from page 11) a career in medicine.\" Curtis' statement in this docement was ac\u00ad companied by the closing warning, \"Signed under the pains and penalties of perjury.\" 0 On June 26 past, Judge John Mc\u00ad Naught of the Superior Court held a hearing on the Sullivan case, a hearing necessita ted when Tufts refused to attempt to conciliate the case. Curtis appeared at the hearing with the above-mentioned affidavit, responding to Sullivan's charges. While admitting that \"age may have been considered\" in the decision to deny admission to Sullivan, Curtis stated that this issue \"was not a decisive factor in not admitting him.\" Also included in the affidavit were the figures describing the class to which Sullivan had applied. There were 4,580 applicants for 146 places in 1974, said Curlis, and \"younger persons more qualified than Dr. Sullivan were rejected from this class.\" Sullivan presented, among other things, his qualifications for admission. \"I averaged in the 96th percentile on the Medical College Admission Test,\" he says, \"and graduated from Harvard in 1959 with a 3.2 average at a time when a 3.2 was equivalent, on a com\u00ad parative scale, to at least a 3.5 nowadays .\" In addition, Sullivan's lawyer ob\u00ad tained the recommenndations filed on Sullivan throughout the admissions process at Tufts. The Medical School admissions process is a complicated one. It in\u00ad volves three levels of recom\u00ad mendations . On the first level, there are three evaluations , which result in a rating of either \"star,\" \"one,\" \"two,\" or \"three,\" \"three\" being the lowest. Two of the evaluators, Dr. Harold Nash, assistant clinical professor of surgery at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Brighton, and Jay Wish, a Tufts medical school student, rated Sullivan as being in a particularly unusual class; they each rated him \"a superstar.\" Nash added his opinion that \"despite the applicant's age, he deserves an interview.\" The third recommendation , a \"three,\" was written by Dr. Lucien Leape, who is chairman of pediatric surgery at Tufts medical school, after a March 9, 1975, interview with Sullivan. Leaoe felt that \"Dr. Sullivan has qualifications in the top one percent of all our applicants . There is no question he would be an outstanding student. I gave him the \"three\" because of his age ... This is a tough policy decision that must be made at the highest level. If he is taken, he will be a joy to have as a student and a credit to our school as a graduate.\" Leape refused to comment on the interview or his evaluations . Curtis countere \u00b7d these recom-mendations with the final rejection report, from the third level of the ad\u00ad mission process, of Dr. Henry Wortis, associate professor of pathology at the medical school. Wortis had never in\u00ad terviewed of met Sullivan until after Curlis informed Sullivan of his rejec\u00ad tion. \"Dr. Sullivan does not appear on this final list\" Wortis writes, \"because there are other more qualified can\u00ad didates. We noted a) he did not have an outstanding undergraduate record; bl he seems to have taken a long time to get his Ph.D.; c) his record of social involvement beyond teaching is not outstanding. We did not feel that these deficiencies were an absolute bar to his admission , nor did we feel that his age would in itself bar him.\" . Why the evaluation changed from overwhelmingly positive on the earlier !eye! to so lukewarm in the final level was not explained by Curtis in his af\u00ad fidavit. On the J!iernoon of July 2, 1975, Judge Mc.:,aughl ruled in favor of Richard Sullivan. He issued a preliminary injunction that has for~ed Tufts to admit Sullivan as a student at TUSM. Tufts has appealed to Lhe Massachusetts Supreme Court for \"interim relief\" from McNal'ght 's decision, and Judge Francis Quirico of the Supreme Court will be holding a hearing on September 24 in preparation for a decision soon thereafter. Meanwhile, according to Huvelle, the MCAD has scheduled a hearing in (Conr..nued on page ;; 2) Mini Carpet Shop 1863 Mass.

But in retrospect , it seems the professional schools. I am not going to clear that Tufts had not come to grips fully elaborate on that point today. I have done with being a university . Precisely what so innumerable times including my last Tufts would be as a university was not yet annual report to the Board. The greatest clear even a decade ago. single difficulty in attaining this objective is the way in which the graduate arts and Our original charter did not clarify the sciences train people in the univer&itiee purpose of the college or the university and the attidtudes scholar-teachers hold as beyond SttJ.ting that we should use the to their function. I felt that the un\u00ad endowment to \"most effectively promote dergraduate school needed a greater sense virtue \u00b7and piety, and learning in such of ________________ _ the languages , and of the liberal and useful arts and sciences: \" The Carnegie Self-Study in the last half of the 'fifties accepted general respon\u00ad sibility for instruction in the liberal arts and sciences and stated that Tufts was . prepared to accept the university roles of: /:-1. pursuing free study and research in the j higher arts and sciences 2. maintaining devotion to the con\u00ad servation, illumination , extension and dissemination of knowledge 3. fostering and nurturing those values which are basic to civilization - 4. training futue scholar-teachers 5. generating ideas for the progress of society \u00b7 These, the Committee regarded \"as the basic concepts of what the modern university is intended to be. The Com\u00ad mittee further stated that \"the simple pursuit of truth shall be the object sought\" and that this concept captured \"in barest detail, the essence of the university con\u00ad cept.\" As !,reflected on these statements and on subsequent acitions, I felt that the formal move to a university in the late 'fifties was largely identified with expansion of the graduate arts and sciences. This in turn influenced the qualities which were sought in new faculty members . No doubt it was understood and accepted that some cost was involved in the form of a higher proportion of faculty timt spent on research and a lesser amount of time spent on direct student contact. These changes did gradually happen. They were good for Tufts and constituted a part of what was to be very important to Tufts in assuming its university role. However , as I viewed it, there were certain deficiencies in the existing university concept. It did not seem to appreciate fully the presence and possibilities of the professional schools at Tufts. More important, this concept of the \"I consider a broader appreciation of the nature and goals of under graduate education to be at the heart of Tufts' continued success.\" of liberal education as I conceived it. I preached it, worked on it and probably won't be a winner in this regard in the foreseeable future. Nonetheless , I consider a broader ap\u00ad preciation of the nature and goals of un\u00ad dergraduate liberal education to be at the heart of Tufts' continued success. It should focus on people and recognize knowledge as a means to an end and involve faculty who recognize and practice this while still advancing the state of knowledge . As graduate arts and sciences adapt to the rigors of the decades ahead, the qualities we need in faculties require that we not return to those who only teach. We con\u00ad tinue to need those \u00b7who love to teach but are also scholars. Tufts can have both without graduate work in all departments . \u00b7 The comment that I made at com\u00ad mencement to the class of 1975 is worth repeating here. It does not fully charac\u00ad terize a liberal education but Professor Brand Blancharc;l, the philosopher , had an unusual talent of putting things together \"It follows that these bouts of college days with intractable assignments, BURTON HALLOWELL ... stick w!th quality witless classmates , and professional ogres are not mere shadow boxing. They are the means of finding yourself and thereby finding your niche in the scheme of things. A faculty should never forget that especially from the ages of 17 to 21 there are personal matters of great concern in the minds of young men and women. They are the means of acquiring that art of thinking without which our world is becoming an increasngly insoluble puzzle. Faculties do this very well. They are the means of learning to like and dislike intelligentl y and therefore rewardingly . They are the means of moulding persons who can act with firmness as well as link with point and judge with taste. This assumes that we stand for something, not that we in\u00ad doctrinate anybody, but that faculties are concerned with raising the level of standards as they see them in people. Like men in the scripture story, you are given talents, some one talent, some two, some perhaps five, and then left to your devices for 4 crucial and testing years to see what you will do with them. On what you do with them depends what the world will do with you. ... If we are to maintain and improve our position, we have to to stick with quality. Cost savings will always be with us. But if threatens real quality, it will not necessarily be to our best interests. This does not mean that we should not look at year-round-operation, workloads , productivity , financial aid policies, and the proper role of the Graduate Arts and Sciences. On YRO, the dean will \u00b7report to us as to his conclusio ns for action before the summer is over. On workloads and productivity, I am delighted that the deans did the homework that they did and that we will finish the presentat iions to the Trustees in September . In the future Tufts, there will be times when tuition increases may be less costly to the university than lower quality. This means more tough choices. But nonetheless , my message is that it is educational waulity that is going to keep Tufts in this world and that costs money. as a totaU university, build intellectual contacts, b,uild programs within itself. The whole is grieater than the sum of the parts. Now, Mr! Chairman , I want to turn to the Chief Exe9utive Officer function. The CEO must see~? it not orlly that the longer range objectives .of the l1rtiversity are translated into daily qperational decisions, but he also must see/ to it that the environment provided ih the non-educational aspects of the university are strongly supportive of the educa 1tional mission. This means first that we must have people in ~he support activities that are not just grea, people in that field, but that they appreciate the faculty and the students and understand them and can deal with them arld know what educational ob\u00ad jectives 'we are headed for. I can't over\u00ad emphasize this. I have seen historically many cases of people doing ostensibly \u00b7 good jol:fa in support activities but who are insensitive to the educational objective s and lo the people who carry them out in the University . Such situations tend to blow up! For!example, Tufts' handling of dining services and budgeting are excellent illustrations of how good relationships should ivork. Moreover , a university in its everyday activities should try to practice the values \"My :message is I that it is educational I qualjty that is going I to ke~p Tufts in this world and that costs money .'i in which it believes educationally . For . example, if we value beauty, we need to eliminate posters on buildings. prevent ex..:....,sive troddening down of lawns. pbnt ne, ; 1\u00b7ees, are for the old ones and ex:iibit a sensitive aesthetic taste in designing buildings . This is more than putting 0n our best face for admissions . It is also because as an educational institution we demon\u00ad strate that we value the beautiful things in life. Our posture with the neighboring communities falls in the same category. If as an iristit1Jlion we want to express a sense of responsibilit y to others, we have to work with our neighborhoods . And we must treat non-faculty personnel with the same dignity as faculty members . In the \u00b7decade we're in. there is an in\u00ad tensification in the attention given to the rights and privileges of people + rights, privileges not to be discriminated against because of race, creed, color. age or sex; rights of1privacy; pension rights, patient rights, 1nd others. Federal and State legislatiop have increasingly spoken to these rig~ts and universities among other institutiops must be in compliance. My educational philosophy relates un\u00ad dergraduate liberal education to the professional schools. I said this in 1967. I have\u00b7 been saying it one way or another ever since, and I have made modest progress. With tbe abrogation . of charitable im\u00ad munity (or universities some years ago and the :advent of this new legislation , universities everywhere. have been sub\u00ad jected t~ legal suits. While personnel procedures everywhere are being tightened! up, the basis for most of these cases re~ts in th~ new legislation and at\u00ad titudes encouraging people to make use of it. Consequently , cases have been brought against universities like Tufts involving decisions basic to academia ; for example, cases inv,olving, In Boston, we had done some wonderful things at Columbia Point and were starting to do something at Mound Bayou, but we were not then \u00b7doing anything in Chinatown .

Hallowell set the tone of his Inauguration speech last Sunday. His in\u00ad sistence on measuring the University's importance in terms of what kind of men it creates and what quality it gives their lives is excellent and timely. Too frequently students feel that their education is irrelevant to the important issues of their lives. We agree that man makes his contribution to society first from the wellsprings of his character , and secondly from his command of knowledge. Character and knowledge grow together as the result .of what Hallowell has called \"imaginative programmatic innovation .\" . The importance of trasmitting and pertetuating knowledge cannot be denied. But the men who must apply this knowledge must not be neglected. In our day, .knowledge is so extensive, specialized and fragmented, it has bP.r..ome a truism to say that our technology has outdistanced our very spirit. Pres. Hallowell suggests that the University has lost its unity because its focus is not on man. In his presidency, Dr. Hallowell intends to refocus on that man. Because the unique individual is the focus, Hallowell says, 'We must increase the easy availability of radically different educational options.\" The Ex\u00ad perimental College stands out as a source and vehicle for educational innovation, and its flexibility makes possible a broad range of educational options. Pass-fail , tne student-Jed fn=:shmen seminars and student-led courses in disciplines, interdepartmental in\u00ad dependent study, and a student sabbatical, are some of the concepts that were developed through the Ex\u00ad perimental College. By attending the first meeting of the Board of the Experimental College and expressing interest in the specific ideas which were discussed, Dr. Hallowell has demonstrated that he has begun working toward the goals introduced in his speech. If the University were to \"adopt\" a neighboring town, as Pres. Hallowell suggested in his address, almost every department could bring its knowledge to bear on the problems particularly relevant to it. The English Department might hold courses in creative writing in the high schools; the Art Department might paint murals or colorful posters for public buildings; the Music Department might sponsor hoots or song-fests at community centers; and the School of Engineering might work on traffic, or sanitation problems. The point is that the University would be demonstrating the wholeness of its concern for its neighbors . At the Tufts undergraduate level there is no place for the great emphasis on specialization and narrow ex-. pertise that is the domain of graduate work. The irony is that most of the large sums of money the University receives are earmarked solely for research done in thevarious graduate departments in the sciences, engineering and medicine . The best that this money can do in terms of the undergraduate goals we have outlined is to free monies for the humanities and pay to im\u00ad plement new ideas in higher education itself. With what money is available, Pres. Hallowell will have to pursue quality, flexibility and innovation in education. We cannot begin too soon to foster a 'climate of concern for the individual.' \u00b7 Pres. Hallowell has declared his philosophy. It is for us to have faith in his willingness to institute change, to offer ideas and plans, and above all, to provide an en\u00ad during critque worthy of our University. Pres. Hallowell has invited us to be partners in his efforts. We can not do less.

Page Fourteen Letters to the edito~ On Jewish liberalism One of the crises of American-Jewish liberalism in the last decade was the awesome possibility of Jewish ethnic suicide. The paradox of a Jewish liberal support of the right to self-expression and cultural self-determination of minorities and the ignoring of its own Jewish heritage is as evident as it is appalling . The crisis lies even deeper within / -lhe century-old struggle between lhe theories of cultural _,Pluralism vs. the melting pot. The liberal ad\u00ad vocacy of cultural pluralism, with its accompanying sup\u00ad port of a multi-cultural American heritage, never succeeded in disrupting the melting pot processes of American life. These same liberal ad\u00ad vocates (Jewish, especially) of cultural pluralism offered their outlook as a critique of American life. They failed in fully developing the im\u00ad portance of 'difference' as an alternative to an America devoid of any invigorating national ethic. No longer a struggling nation, America can afford becoming a \"federation of nationalities,\" a framework for democracy and freedom that nurtures individual group pride rather than its eradication. There has been movement in this direction in the recent reackno'wledging of ethnic traditions . The Jewish liberal, who realizes all too vividly the dangers of a monolithic society, has been in the forefront of support, both . moral and financial, of everyone's cultural development except his or her own. Jewish liberals can readily be approached to champion the causes of op\u00ad pressed people everywhere. He or she can be expected to supoort any effort to alleviate cultural paucity of newly enfranchised ethnic groups! Yel when approach~d lo enhance the efforts of a Jewish group wishing to free the American Jew from lhe op\u00ad pression of his\u00b7 or her cultural ignorance, they shy away. Their reluctance stems from a number of sources. First of all, they are themselves embarrassed that in the sweep of lhe liberal-intellectual vista, he or she is more con\u00ad versan l in lhe culture of his neighbor than his own. Secondly , lhe Jewish liberal with intellectual pretensions finds a balm to his or her self\u00ad imposed marginality in becoming the architect and critic of American life in general. The marginal American-Jewish liberal, self\u00ad eslranged from his or her rools, has not been fully amenable to the possibility of their dissollution into the American MacDonald's ethic. He or she has found solace in creating culture for the non\u00ad Jew, by examining non-Jewish culture and giving it grades. Jewishness becomes a symbol of secular cosmopolitanism and any attempt at \"parochialism\" such as concern for the survival of the Jewish group, is found detrimental to the abovementioned posi~ion he or she has attained.

To read four to six books a week competently is an arduous task for even the brightest of scholars, if he or she plans to do anything besides eat, sleep, and read. . Despair, barring masochistic urges, is fruitless . What is necessary is an efficient method for reading and studying . Although the following is one that may not work for everyone, (science courses, for instance, will not be touched on here) it is worth a try. 1) Books, chapters, and paragraphs are constructed similarly . The author introduces his or her point, presents a wealth of material supporting ( or possibly challenging ) it, and then concludes. If a\u00b7 whole book is assigned , read the first and last chapters fairly carefully. Skim otherwise be unable to sponsor. In addition, I.D.C. would like to generate more activity by dorms and their governments which would help create a closer and more involved campus. Last year I.D.C. did not get off to a smooth start, mainly because of problems involved with the financing of ac\u00ad tivities. It did sponsor a talent show, free movies, a MacPhie dance, and a number of Teele House parties. Should all go well this year, I.D.C. could be a valuable asset to the Tufts community. Therefore , I am requesting that each dorm elect or appoint two respon\u00ad sible, enthusiastic people to serve as I.D.C. reps. These, people should plan to maintain close ties with the dorm's government. I the middle sections for a few examples. Reading the whole book is not only unnecessary, but it may also adversely affect your understanding of the ma,terial. Absorption of too much data can lead to confusion of the author's main points. 2) If chapters are assigned, they can be read similarly . Read the first two and last two pages first, then skim the middle. After a little practice, the results are impressive. You are expected to be familiar with basic concepts, not with details. By the end of hhe first semester, a two hundred page assignment should not take more than two hours. 3) Underlining is helpful. but takes time. Underline main points, but not examples . Do not underline everything . An asterisk, exclamation point, or a line in the margin fulfills the same function as underlining . 4) If a thought inspires you while you are reading, do not dismiss it as insignificant. Write it down. It may be one of those brilliant insights that term papers are made of. Try not to feel insecure about using those thoughts in both papers and in the classroom . Remember , you are as intelligent as most of the professors -just not as refined. 5) Keep careful notes in class, but be discriminating . If you write down everything the professor says, you will be overburdened with material come exam time. Only write down what impresses you as significant. What you hear in class is really more important than what you read, because it reflects the professor 's priorities and is more likely to appear on an exam. 6) To study for exams, re-read thoroughly notes and un-derlinin~s only_. Skim other reading material. If you try and re-read everything thoroughly , you will be bogged down with too much material. That will distract you from \"the essence\" which is what most professors are looking for. 7) Think. This cannot be said enough. A computer can play back anything that is fed into it. That is its job, not yours. Con\u00ad tribute your brains, your ex- . periences, your imagination , to both the classroom and the exam. A teacher of mine once asserted that, \"A 'C' exam is one where the student show he has un\u00ad derstood some of the material. A 'B' exam is one where the professor feels the student contributed thought and imagination , and, very possibly, taught the professor something he didn't previously know.\" HEW's rules on women This article is reprinted from the Editorial section of the Washington Post, June 16, 1975. With all the hullabaloo over the impact on college sports of the new federal sex bias rules, it is easy to overlook the real im\u00ad portance of those rules which is that. they should open the coun\u00ad try's educational institutions to women in a way they have never been open before. That will mean, in the long run, more female doctors and other professionals , more female scholars and college teachers, more females in technical jobs, and, to some extent. more female athletes. The rules mean, simply, that the nation is taking another significant step toward a time when intellect and talent and competence in general will be recognized as such in all en\u00ad deavors-whether academic or athletic-regar dless of the sex of the person concerned . In that sense, the fight over what these rules will do to sports and athletic programs is a side issue. The real im_pact of them will be on things that matter much more in life-things like admission to vocational and p:\"Gf;;;;;;;Giia! g~h~!s and\u00b7 public colleges, access t0 !:01.!!\"~~!3 and scholarship funds, and em-second-rate travel arrangements solely because they are female. There is nothing in the .Con\u00ad stitution or in the nature of the world that says only males can be athletes or that male athletes are entitles, if they are good enough, to free education, free foiy and free roedical c~r~. er.titled, if they are good enough, 1noeeo, we suspect that there are a good many university presidents who, way down deep inside, are cheering that part of the HEW rules having to do dir\u00b7ectly with sports. The em\u00ad phasis of all too many campuses has reached the point where it ployment practices . In these appears the purpose of the areas, as well as in athletics, university is not to educate young educational institutions at all people but to produce winning levels have consistently football or basketball teams. The discriminated against women presiden ts know this-and down through the years. The new despair at what it is doing to their rules, if they are properly en-institutions -but many of them forced by HEW, will do much to have felt unable to tackle the eliminate that discrimination . problem because of the power There is also a matter of basic their athletic departments have fairness involved in the athletic with alumni., These new rules programs and if it takes :\u00be may provide the impetus they complete change in the nature of need to begin to bring the right intercollegiate sports to produce perspective back to to the that fairness , so be it. There is campuses. If so, HEW's efforts something fundamentally wrong will serve not only to give to with a college or university or. women what is rightfully theirs for that melter, a lower level but to restore some balance school, that relegated its female between what is meaningful in aihieies lu 5&(:uiid-raie i'aciiiiies li;gh~r education and what is fun or second-r;:!e equipment or and games. I.D.C. will have its first meeting on Wednesday at 8 p.m. in Robinson 253. At the first meeting we will begin to work on a charter and a budget that wili bepresented to the T.C.U. Senate. One important topic of discussion will be the fate of the ~ ! . ~~ per student_ :i~iocation that is currently given to all dorms and small houses. We will also plan the election of new of\u00ad ficers. I Hallowell self-examination I.D.C. has great potential at Tufts, but its ciai~:; io legitimacy rest upon re~~.:sentation by every dorm and house. I hope that each dorm and house will be able to assist I.D.C. in achieving its goals, and I am looking for\u00ad ward to meeting all new I.D.C. reps soon.

This is an increasingiy difficult task. If we are going to stick with quality and respond to social change, we are going to need capital money. We have already as a Board made the decision to secure a feasibility study con\u00ad cerning major capital raising. I hope that Board will continue on that route this year and thereafter. I have no doubt but that we'are going to do well in raising capital money. When you take the Chief Executive Officer's functions and put them together with the President 's educational views, you gain a sense as to how the present president has viewed things, and how he has attempted to determine what is important and what is unimportant. This provides you with a basis for either disagreeing or agreeing and for looking ahead to see what you want to do in the years ahead. We have had an educational philosophy . We have an educational direction . We have had management direction. The future, ladies and gentlemen, is in your hands. \u00b7Thank you, Mr. Chairman .

By STEVEN ROLTAI This past week, 80 incoming freshmen began their first year at Tufts in an unprecedented way as participants in the new In\u00ad tegrated Studies Program (ISP). The ISP was approved by the faculty of Arts and Sciences last spring and was publicized lo incoming students as \"an alternative to the freshman year\" over the summer. According to the final draft description of the program, the ISP \"is an optimal curriculum for freshmen who may prefer to elect a planned and integrated set of courses for their first year at Tufts.\" The ISP program consists of a four or five course schedule of related or integrated courses centering around a seminar course led by a faculty member from an existing academic department. The four seminar courses currently offered are: The Road to Hitler, led by Ger\u00ad man professor Sol Gittelman , Civil Disobedien ce, led by philosophy professor Hugo Bedau; Poetry and Our Lives led by English professor Denise Levertov; and Individuals and Institutions, to be taught jointly by History professor Howard Solomon and Tufts president Burton Hallowell. In addition to the seminar class, students select a support course from the regular course offerings of the semester upon the suggestiop of several possible courses submitted by the seminar leaders. A third course is offered in the form of con\u00ad temporary issues which will itself consist of three mini courses.The mini courses will be taught by various professors from throughout the university and will frequently be opened lo the general Tufts community. The director of the program , Philosophy professor Hugo Bedau, said considering the \"gamble involved in any new alternative , we are pleased with the initial response\" lo ISP>. More wonten in class of '79 BYTMLNDON More women and less minority students are included in this year's freshman class. A recently released profile of the class of 1979 also reveals that ap\u00ad plications for admissions to Tufts were up two percent over last year, reversing , a 15 percent decline the previous year. \"The most striking fact about the new class,\" Dean of Ad\u00ad missions John Palmer explained , \"is the number of women in it.\" The entering class in Liberal Arts and Jackson includes 425 women and 356 men. However, since only \u00b7 15 females have enrolled this year in the College of Engineering, there are still more men in the Medford campus. Palmer said there is a trend for increasing women engineering enrollment and he expects that soon women will comprise a third of that school's enrollment. Minority student enrollment in the entering class is 13 percent, down from last year's record high of 16 percent. Palmer said that despite the decline, Tufts still enrolls more minority students then any comparable university. He attributed the drop to the somewhat smaller number of minority students applying and to the money crunch. \"We're spending less on financial aid because there's less institutional or federal money available with the resession,\" he said. Still, Palmer claims that Tufts spends half of its financial aid on minority students. This year's entering class seems more confused as to possible majors then previous classes. Twenty five percent of the class listed their proposed major field as undecided com\u00ad pared with 13 percent last year. JOHN PALMER . . . applicants up Of those declaring proposed majors, 27 percent in Liberal Arts and 21 percent in Jackson chose social sciences. Next in popularity was other sciences listed by 21 percent of Liberal Arts and 14 percent of Jackson. Only nine percent of Liberal Arts and four percent of Jackson labeled themselves premedicine or predentistry. Thirty percent of the entering Liberal Arts and Jackson class comes from Massachusetts, 15 percent from other New England states, 38 percent from Mid\u00ad Atlantic states, seven percent from the North Central area, and 10 percent from the South, West, or foreign countries . SAT scores for entering students declined following the nationwide trend. Average verbal SAT's were 558 in Liberal Arts, 564 in Jackson, and 541 in Engineering . Average math scores were 621 in Liberal Arts, 583 in Jackson, and 670 in Engineering . Palmer said he was uncertain whether the decline in scores means the quality of undergraduates is declining or if new cultural knowledge not 625-4646 delivery boy wanted Page Eightan FREE DEUVERY UN'ftL 12 :00 MIDNIGHT 138 COLLEGE AVENUE covered by the standardized tests have become important. The entering class includes 945 freshmen and 71 transfers . Over 6400 applications were received and 2342 candidates were ac\u00ad cepted. Palmer said that \"we are now in an extraordinarily competitive world for students with ability and resources .\" He predicted that there will be important changes in the admissions staff this year in order to make Tufts more competitive but refused to disclose details. Palmer said that his biggest worries now concern the recession . He explained that \"at first a recession encourages people to go back to education at all levels but if it continues for a long period then expensive education will be the first casualty.\" Palmer also worries about the increasing vocationalism of students. \"To continue to attract students we'll have to convince them that the humanities education we offer is better then a narrow vocational educa lion tract,\" he said. r --------~ .\u00b7 \"\"R' and beautiful face of ;n. \u00b7 \u00b7 ,, ha/p does not change n h,\u00b7 : //Ii lb. harpoon ONE WHALE GETS IT EVERY 12 MINUTES KILL CATCHES FOR 1974 Fin 23,000 TOT AL THIS YEAR .... 37,300 r-\u00b7 ........ 4,000 a month o, ........... 1,000 a week or ................. 140 a day or ........ 1 every 12 minutes WHAT ARE WE DOING?

However , Friedland said Monday that the majority of the problems were cleared up this week. She pointed out that despite the increased number of room requests, everyone who asked for on-..:arnpus housing has been offered a room and that the students temporarily assigned Io lounges and study halls in Car\u00ad mjchael have been moved. Although the housing office was prepared for this year's unusually large freshman class, Friedland said she expected a lot more students lo withdraw from the universll over the summer 1 han actually did. Friedland also said that very few I udent s broke their room r\u00b7on. ra ct s because of the stiff fine's that would have resulted. However , she\u00b7 said, a few students who did break their room contracts after the Aug. 15 deadline were not asked lo pay the full $500 fine because of the need for extra rooms. Friedland added that a large number of students who expected to live off campus this semester and who couldn't fine apartments or had their leases fall through, applied for on-campus housing late in the summer. But she said once the housing office was able to determine which rooms were still available , at the beginning of.last week, it was able to find rooms for every student who requesl ed to live on campu::,. \"There are good rooms on campus and bad rooms on campus,\" she said, \"and there are always some people who are going to get stuck.\" But so far this year,\" she added, \"it seems that less students are less iiissat isfied with their rooms than before.\" The only major complaint she has received so far, she said, is that fewer juniors and seniors--are\u00ad living in Miller and Houston halls this year. She pointed out that because these dorms do not have singles they are less attractive lo up\u00ad perclassmen who usually opt lo live in down-the-hill-dorms .

When we left them last May, the Tufts Sailors were wrapping up another phenomenal season, completely dominating the competition at every regatta held in the New England area. Before previewing this year's team, a \u00b7 look at what took place over the summer is in order. The National Intercollegiate Sailing Championships were held in Chicago this past June, and both the men's and women's teams from Tufts were represented . The single handed championship , sailed in Force Fives, was won by Tufts captain Sam Altreuter,earning him All\u00ad American honors for the second consecutive year. In the dinghy class, Altreuter skippered the A division with Cindy Palladino crewing, while Neal Fowler, (also named All\u00adThe perennially strong Tufts sailing team was officially named number one team in the country by virtue of their performance at the cham\u00ad pionships.

Looking ahead al this season's team, Captain Altreuter described it as \"the strongest team we've ever had at Tufts.\" Nobody has a secure spot on the team having lost no skippers from last season, and picking up many excellent freshman sailors.

However , Yale and U.R.I. will probably remain strong, and Harvard , with All\u00ad American Terry Neff returning after a leave of absence, will probably be the greatest threat in the New England area. Once again Coach Joe Duplin has collected some of the best collegiate sailors in the natic,n, and he hopes to hang on to that number one ranking.

Carzo, White get athletic posts John White in action two years ago when a senior at Tufts. He recently assumed the head basketball coaching job here after Robert John\u00ad son's departure. Pagei'wenty Some old faces have been in\u00ad stalled in some new positions. Rocco J. Carzo, after serving a year as acting athletic director, was named to the newly created position of director of programs in physical 'education and dance, athletics and recreation. Tran\u00ad slated it means that Prof. Carzo was named to head the entire physical education \u00b7 departmen t including the intramural and dance programs. Joining him at the Cousens Gym offices will be John White '73, who after a year's hiatus with Tom Penders at Columbia, has reduced to replace the departed Robert Johnson as basketball coach, hoping to reinstill the success that he experienced during his years including one as tri-captain for the Jumbos. Carzo, who has been in the coaching business for 20 of his 42 years, has served as a football, lacrosse, and golf coach since coming to Tufts in 1966. His 1969 football team recorded the best record in a decade (6-2) and set most of the university passing records. After a distinguished career as a 165-pound fullback at Delaware , he stayed on as an assistant coach and helped develop the Wing-T offense that ha.s propelled the Blue Hens to national small college prominence . He then moved to the University of California at Berkeley where he helped work with All-American quarterback Craig Morton, now toiling with the New York Giants. In 1973, he resigned as football coach lo concentrate on the duties of assistant athletic director under Harry Arlanson . With Arlanson 's retirement in June '74, Carzo became acting AD until Dean of the Faculty Bernard Harleston announced the appointment of Carzo to the newly created position. Harleston and a search committee had mulled over a hundred applicants for the job. Harleston believes Carzo can \"bring leadership , drive and concentration to meet the challenges \" provided by the Obsener depar: mental restructuring . For those who were here when the Jumbos ran up a 22-4 basketba ll record and captured an ECAC tournament , John White is still an important part of the \u00b7TU basketball tradition . Many also remember him for his guiding the '73-'74 frosh to a 16-3 year. For White, the job is like a homecoming . \"New York City ' was more like a foreign country to me,\" he said from his new desk at Cousens. \"It was very tough, not a very comfortable en\u00ad vironment. \" His move ftom the Hills of Harlem to the Medford Hillside could mean the rein\u00ad statement of the fast break\u00ad harrassing defense style which i characterized the Penders years and was sadly missing last year. These two appointments seem to be the last of the transitional periold that marked 1974. That year saw a large influ~ of new coaching techniques begin to revitalize Tufts athletics1 Carzo and White may be the progenitors of a new Tufts tradition .

No, Medford wasn't founded in 1875, rather, it. was a hundred years ago that the Jumbos first took to the football \u00b7field. Actually, Tufts didn't acquire Jumbo until 1885 so they were probably going by some other name back then. For the first time in a while, a Tufts personality not con\u00ad nected with a court case received some national ex\u00ad posure. Sam Altreuter, the All\u00ad American senior who has been sailing successfully for Tufts' top-ranked sailing team was one of the \"Faces in the Crowd\" in the July 7 edition of Sports Illustrated .

A time for the new coach to get used to his job and a time for the players to get used to him, at least that's what the sportswriters liked to say.

Observer Downtown lntrod:ucing the Sox _ By JON CRAMER All freshmen, transfers and even old-timers must pay attention . This is to inform all of you that you will now forget about the Yankees, Mets, Phillies and Astros. When in Boston, one must do as the Bostonians do and in this year of the Red Sock that means you must concentrate on the idea of a World Series at Fenway. Just look at the Red Sox lineup. What college student could fail to recognize the innocence and purity. There aren't any $3 million defectors or glamourized tradees. You won't even find Yaz vying for the triple crown. The big story in these parts involves two rookies named Lynn and Rice, who, if Bostonians had their way would be named co-winners of the rookie of the year award, MVP award and most admired American award. . In April when the New York press wags were already preparing for the Yankees' clubhouse champagne party, Rice and Lynn were as familiar to major league fans aw Sixto Lezcano and Tom Veryzer. Today, the two upstarts have combined for 200 RB l's and 45 homers and both boys are well above the .300 mark. Now guess (without the help of you natives) who the next big gu,n is for the Bosox. l'fo, not Yaz or Petrocelli or Tiant. Next comes one Cecil Cooper, owner of a .326 average and presently a swollen face. (He was beaned in Milwaukee over the weekent). And to add insult to New York's injury a fellow named Denny Doyle, who was cast off by both the Angels and Phillies, hit safely in 22 straight games to help the Sox build their present lead. . The mound story is not quite such a fairy tale. Teams don't usually win with staff ERA's of 4.00 but \u00b7 with Lynn and Rice teeing off at their pace, the pit\u00ad chers haven't had to worry. If you go to a Red Sox game here's what to expect. For now, if Rogelio Moret pitches, you can expect a victory (he's 12-3). If Bill Lee pitches, you can expect a victory (he's 17-9). If Rick Wise pitches you can probably expect a victory (he's 18-9). Ignore the fact that none of these guys has an ERA under 3.50 because when you've got it, you've got it. Now we come to the topic of performance under pressure or in more familiar Boston parlance, the Red Sox Retreat. Behind Boston in the standings is a name as familiar as Yastremski and as popular as Nixon. The Baltimore Orioles, All are familiar with the precedent. The Red Sox build up a big lead then yield to the Orioles who feel they are the rightful owners of the Eastern Division of the AL. Hopefully, for New Englanders, this year's group will break with tradition. As of this writing, the Sox are five games up on the Birds. The Orioles, for their part,\u00b7 aren't playing prolific ball. But then again neither are the Bostons, Ignore Saturday 's 20-6 massacre of.the Brewers, the Red Sox have slackened a bit at the plate and now must peel a wary eye upon their pursuers . As a baseball fan you must now be dying for a chance to climb into your seat at Fenway and en\u00ad courage the Sox. Getting a seat is about as difficult for a Sox fan as a victory is to come by for an Astro. It takes a clever man to procure a ticket but trial and error will teach you the way. Page Twenty-One -0 New extensions, computer added to phone system By HELEN GLIKMAN Since July 9, Tufts has been using a telephone traffic analyzer to measure and record activity on departmental lines throughout the university. disconnected by New England Telephone . To have the phones reconnected this fall, students contacted New England Telephone and paid a service charge of $22.50. According to John Ward, Director of Office Services, the analyzer keeps track of depart\u00ad mental calls for billing purposes , and helps measure activity on university lines. By Sept. 30, departments will be able to place outgoing calls without operator assistance. Over the summer, additional phones were installed in many , ' rooms.If students wanted these phones activated, they had to pay the full installationfee of $32.50. The full installation fee also applied to those who had new phones installed this month. Ward eventually would like to see wall phones permanently installed in all dorm rooms. He said this would save students money and reduce theft since Departments will receive monthly print-outs which list the cost of their calls and to whom they were made. Because phones are billed on a measured business line, departments pay for each call made. Ward believes that depart\u00ad ments will becorne more cost\u00ad conscious once they see to whom they are making calls. He predicts the analyzer will reduce the un\u00b7versity's phone bill by 25 to 35 percent. The second purpose of the analyzer is to measure activity on university phgnes. Depart\u00ad ments will receive information on the number of incoming calls per hour, thus determinin_g if thE:Y have an adequate number of extensions .

Mr. Moore's feet grew some more over the summer and until some shoes are found, his feet will be a bit cramped. While the present tensions exist in Boston over the desegregat ion activity, the national guard must be mobilized to prepare for any disturbances . That's the Wl)rd that new basketball coach John White received along with an invitation to report to his national guard unit at Wakefield. White's job will be to serve with the medical corps until the guard is demobilized , despite being a political science major at Tufts. We sincerely hope no one gets hurt.

This weakness was borne out by the 6tatistics which indicate that the opposition out-gained the home folks by almost 2 to one on the ground. \"We're very far ahead of last year at this time,\" said Pawlak. And well they might be after leaving the ball in Bowdoin's hands for 35 of the first_ quarter's 37 plays last year. Hope for the defense lies in the area of stability. Last year, freshmen were run in and out while some of the more \u00b7 dependable linemen were hampered by injuries.
