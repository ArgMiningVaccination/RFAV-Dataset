Booster doses help boost your antibodies and give you good protection from becoming seriously ill or needing to go to hospital if you get COVID-19. A first booster is recommended for all adults age 18 years and older. After this, seasonal boosters are recommended for some people. The next seasonal boosters will be offered in autumn. We will update this page when autumn boosters are available.

Seasonal boosters are recommended for people at higher risk from serious COVID-19 illness. Those at higher risk need to get a booster dose more often to maintain their protection against serious COVID-19 illness. If you would like an autumn booster and are not in a high-risk group, talk to your GP or pharmacist.

[A parent or guardian will need to give consent for their child's vaccination](https://www2.hse.ie/screening-and-vaccinations/covid-19-vaccine/get-the-vaccine/children/#giving-consent-for-vaccination). Which vaccine you will be offered You will be offered a bivalent Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine as a booster dose. These are mRNA vaccines. These adapted vaccines work in the same way as the original Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. But they are expected to give even more protection against COVID-19 variants. If you are 30 or older, you will be offered either the bivalent Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine or the bivalent Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine you will be offered will depend on supply. If you are 29 or younger, you will be offered the bivalent Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine as your booster dose. You may get a non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, like Novavax, if an mRNA vaccine is not suitable or you choose not to have an mRNA vaccine.

There have not been any unexpected safety concerns so far. The safety of the vaccines continues to be monitored by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The side effects of the bivalent mRNA booster vaccines are similar to the original vaccines. The most regularly reported side effects are headache, fever, and tiredness. Myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory heart conditions and are very rare risks of mRNA vaccines. These rare side effects are more common in men under the age of 30 years after their second primary vaccine dose. The risk of these side effects appears to be lower after the first booster.
