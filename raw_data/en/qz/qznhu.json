I've always enjoyed reading and gobbling up books. But this year it seemed I couldn't get past more than a couple of pages of anything at any time. \"The Well-Lived Life\"-a new book by Dr. Gladys McGarey-had been sitting on my desk collecting dust for months. Finally, I picked it up, started reading, and could barely put it down. Thank you Gladys. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you!! Dr. McGarey is one of the most interesting and inspiring people I've ever had the honor of meeting. She is widely recognized as the Mother of Holistic Medicine, and she has lived an extraordinarily rich life. Her new book is centered around the following six \"secrets\", which she says are the keys to living a happy and purposeful life: Spend your energy wildly: How to embrace your life fully, and feel motivated every day. All life needs to move: How to move\u2014spiritually, mentally, and physically\u2014to help let go of trauma and other roadblocks. You are here for a reason: How to find the everyday \"juice\" that helps you stay oriented in your life's purpose. You are never alone: How to build connections and community that are meaningful and supportive for you. Everything is your teacher: How to glean lessons and meaning from the pain and the setbacks we all experience at times. Love is the most powerful medicine: Learn to love yourself, and you'll learn to love others. This is the wellspring of healing. Throughout the book, McGarey addresses the reality of suffering, and offers guidance on responding to it in a life-giving way: \"When we look for the lessons, we move our attention away from our suffering and direct it back toward life.\" I first met Gladys at a meeting of the American Holistic Medical Association, back in 2000, around the time we launched Holistic Primary Care. I was moved by her presence, and she has been a guiding spirit for me and for HPC ever since. Twenty years ago, we published an article covering her talk about the ways that military metaphors and fear-based logic were ruining medicine. And in the height of the Covid pandemic, we hosted an open conversation in which she reflected on the meaning of the pandemic from the perspective of someone who lived through the Great Depression, World War Two, the Cold War, the cultural upheavals of the 60s and 70s, and many personal and societal crises. Whether in person, or in her writing, Gladys McGarey has a gift for saying what needs to be said, for touching peoples' hearts. \"Grief isn't quite the same as depression-grief moves, while depression stands still. When we let our grief move, we don't suppress it; instead, we focus on our love for whomever or whatever was lost, while letting the suffering pass through us.\" The 25th anniversary of my mother's death came up this July and I was experiencing all the grief I hadn't felt at the time when way too much was happening all at once. It was like a volcano erupting or an oil cap blowing. In honor of my mother, I wrote The Peace Rose, a poem about love, loss, rebirth and life's great mystery. As Gladys writes: \"Life itself is always in movement, so aligning with our life force means that we must always look for the flow within us.\" The Well-Lived Life isn't just a description of Gladys' interesting, exotic and contemplated life, it's a support and template we all can use to frame our own existence. This very wise woman\u2014who raised six children and practiced family medicine for more than 60 years-distills a lifetime's worth of insight on how to heal - how to help. At the end of her book she shares a dream of walking up an aisle to receive an award while realizing the back of her dress is unbuttoned. With each step she takes, a hand fastens a button, and then another hand fastens the next button until she reaches the stage and her dress is completely fastened. It's a beautiful image, and doubly interesting to me because in the Spring of 2020 Holistic Primary Care was going to honor Dr McGarey with a lifetime achievement award at our then annual conference, The Practitioner Channel Forum. Then COVID came and the world shut down, our Forum along with it. We were unable to present her with the award. Not that she needs it. Gladys McGarye's life has been truly well-lived, and is its own reward. Through her writing, she shares her experiences and tells her tales in a way that inspires and comforts at the same time. This wise woman is not only a Godmother of Holistic Medicine, she's a Fairy Godmother of life itself, spreading love, and always pointing us toward the fundamental truth that we really do need each other to grow and live healthy, fulfilling lives. One of the first American women to ever earn an MD degree, Gladys McGarey trained at a time when there were so few female med students that she had to sleep on an x-ray table for want of a proper dorm room. From the very beginning of her career, she recognized the limitations of alopathic medicine. She was one of the first physicians to introduce spirituality into medical practice, to utilize modalities like acupuncture, and to speak openly about the vital role of love in the healing process. Back in the 70s, she co-founded the American Holistic Medical Association (now called the Academy of Integrative Health & Medicine). At 102 years old, Gladys is still going strong, continuing her healing work as a medical consultant via her Foundation for Living Medicine, and through her writing. Are contemporary allopathic medicine and Ayurveda mutually compatible? Is it possible to merge modern biomedical science with ancient healing principles defined millennia ago? Is there any relevance in today's medical clinic for a paradigm centered substantially around pulse diagnosis, or for therapeutics focused on behavior modification, herbs, mind-body therapies, and detoxification? Most importantly, what purpose would be served by integrating these paradigms? These are questions that confront any practitioner who recognizes that contemporary allopathy, despite its strengths, also has limitations, and who also surmises that India's ancient health practices may have some value. Qualitative & Quantitative Modern allopathic medicine derives its strength from its astonishing ability to quantify biochemical processes at the organ system, cellular, and genetic levels. Ayurveda, which evolved centuries before the invention of the microscope or the elucidation of the Krebs cycle, is highly qualitative and descriptive. It reflects a sophisticated understanding of processes and patterns within someone's body and psyche. Often, a constellation of symptoms that make little sense in allopathic terms, will fit within patterns described by Ayurveda. For example, consider a patient who is constipated and also suffers from insomnia. From an allopathic perspective, these problems are separate \"departments.\" If the \"first line\" drugs don't work, many MDs might send this patient for separate consultations with a psychiatrist and a gastroenterologist. Viewed from an Ayurvedic perspective, the insomnia and constipation are very much related: both reflect an imbalance or dysregulation of Vata\u2014one of the three doshas or basic categories of physiological functions and qualities. Vata governs and influences all movements in the body, especially its rhythms and cycles. Sleep, digestion, and elimination are all cyclic, rhythmic processes. As it turns out, we can optimize both diagnosis and therapeutics through the judicious blending of allopathic and ayurvedic paradigms. Two Angles on Diabetes Consider the condition we know as type 2 diabetes, which of course represents a major public health challenge, impacting 11% adults worldwide, according to a recent analysis of global epidemiological data (Ong KL, et al. Lancet. 2023). In allopathic terms, it is characterized by hyperglycemia caused by increased insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion, or both. Through that lens, our \"job\" as primary care doctors is to optimize blood sugar control through a combination of diet, exercise, oral drugs, and injectables like insulin. We monitor the condition by measuring glucose, insulin, and hemoglobin A1c. We try to prevent the downstream cardiovascular consequences of diabetes by prescribing statins, ACE inhibitors, and the like. In classical Ayurveda, there's no specific disease called \"type 2 diabetes,\" though physicians in ancient India did recognize that some people urinate very frequently, that the urine is sweet, and that this is connected with unhealthy fat accumulation (not all weight gain is considered unhealthy). What we call type 2 diabetes most closely resembles what Ayurveda calls madumeha, or \"honey in the urine.\" It's one of 20 types of prameha (polyuria). The Three Doshas Ayurveda views health and disease in terms of the balance or imbalance between the 3 fundamental physiologic or psychometabolic principles called doshas. These are vata, pitta, and kapha. Vata governs all movement in the mind, body, and spirit. Pitta governs heat, digestion, and metabolic transformation; Kapha governs structure and lubrication. Aggravation of one or more of these doshas can lead to imbalances which, left unchecked, eventually result in disease. A kapha imbalance often manifests as weight gain, lethargy, and then to madumeha. Associated symptoms may include accumulation of \"dirt\" in the teeth, burning sensation in the hands and feet, oily, excessive thirst, and a sweet taste in the mouth. In qualitative terms, a kapha imbalance is an excess of heaviness, sweetness, and moistness which, in turn aggravates the fat tissue (called medu dhatu in Sanskrit) \u2014a process that we might describe as insulin resistance driving inflammation. Left uncorrected, a kapha imbalance will gradually pull the other doshas\u2014pitta, and then vata-out of balance, leading to a wide range of multi-system problems. A Higher Bar Allopathic medicine recognizes that type 2 diabetes is a \"lifestyle\" disease, driven by high glycemic diets, and lack of exercise. But in routine practice, our medical systems give that little more than lip service. Prescription drugs are our primary tools for treating diabetes\u2014and most other disorders. A healthy person is someone in whom the three doshas are in balance and the organ systems are working well together. A healer's \"job,\" so to speak, is to help people find their way back to that state. In that sense, the bar for clinical success is actually much higher in Ayurveda than in modern allopathy. In Ayurveda\u2014which literally means \"science of life\"\u2014what we call \"lifestyle\" is central to the origin of most diseases, and it is the primary means by which we can restore health. Though people have innate tendencies toward particular doshic imbalances, it is really our dietary habits, sleep patterns, exercise, environment, stress levels, and relationships that determine whether they will become problematic. What we call \"unhealthy lifestyle choices\" are the result, according to Ayurveda, of praghya aparadh\u2014\"mistake of the intellect.\" This implies that someone has lost the deep understanding that the normal state is to be healthy and blissful. By getting too caught up in material concerns, and pursuit of external self-validation, people become anxious and upset, leading to unhealthy behaviors like overeating, consumption of excessive sweets, and drug or alcohol abuse. A healthy person is someone in whom the three doshas are in balance and the organ systems are working well together, allowing the person to experience pure bliss. A healer's \"job,\" so to speak, is to help people find their way back to that state. In that sense, the bar for clinical success is actually much higher in Ayurveda than in modern allopathy. In the context of diabetes, yes, we have to pay attention to blood sugar. Yes, we have to normalize insulin responsiveness, reduce inflammation, and prevent end-stage heart, retinal, and renal disease. But our ultimate goal is far beyond just getting someone's blood sugar in range. We need to help our patients restore balance and overcome the praghya aparadh that is the deeper root cause of the illness. Diagnostically and therapeutically, the two systems complement one another. Each brings strengths that the other lacks. In the case of type 2 diabetes, the Ayurvedic model allows for early detection of imbalances long before disease actually manifests, potentially empowering patients to avoid getting ill. Ayurveda offers many time-tested dietary, botanical, and detoxification modalities to help restore balance and health. It also includes meditation, movement, and stress reduction practices. These are central to the Ayurvedic approach, not low-priority \"complementary\" side-dishes as they often are in some Western \"integrative\" clinics. Pulse Assessment Recognition of doshic imbalances is a clinical art that takes time and training to master. Pulse assessment is a key element in Ayurvedic diagnosis. As is written in one of the classic texts: \"The artery pulsating at the base of the thumb indicates life. Happiness and misery, including balanced and imbalanced states of the physiology, should be known from its movements.\" -Sharngadhar Samhita, Purv Khand, m3.1 Pulse diagnosis involves placing the index, middle, and ring fingers on the patient's radial artery just proximal to the radial styloid (in other words just above the wrist). The vata value of the pulse is detected by the index finger, the pitta value by the middle finger, and the kapha value by the ring finger. This system includes a set of nuanced, almost poetic descriptions of healthy and imbalanced pulses. For example, the vata pulse detected by the index finger should feel sinuous, like a snake, while the middle pitta pulse should be jumpy like a frog, and the kapha pulse should be smooth like a swan. To a Western medical mind, trained to think quantitatively, these descriptions may seem vague and impractical. But they are actually quite precise, once you begin to sense and study them. Ayurvedic pulse diagnosis gives us a way to detect physiological imbalances at a very subtle and early level, allowing us to intervene long before disease begins to manifest. In the context of type 2 diabetes, it can help delineate the prevailing doshic imbalance, allowing for more targeted therapies such as an appropriate dosha-balancing diet, or a dosha-specific program of spices, aroma oils, and herbs. This allows for a more holistic approach to patient care, ultimately leading to improved glucose control. In Ayurveda, strong digestion is central to good health. Weak digestion leads to accumulation of toxins, which then get deposited in the tissues, providing substrate for the imbalanced dosha to cause tissue damage. Pulse assessment provides valuable information about a patient's digestive function. Further, because it is a gentle, hands-on process pulse assessment fosters the bond between physician and patient, and enhances the healing connection. An Integrated Approach The Ayurvedic perspective is very different from that of Western allopathy, yet it provides a compelling model for augmenting conventional care. Diagnostically and therapeutically, the two systems complement one another. Each brings strengths that the other lacks. In the case of type 2 diabetes, the Ayurvedic model allows for early detection of imbalances long before disease actually manifests, potentially empowering patients to avoid getting ill. If the disease has already manifested, allopathic diagnostic guidelines and lab testing provide very accurate measures of glycemic control which are useful in planning, implementing, and monitoring treatments. Because it emphasizes mind-body interventions, Ayurveda goes a long way in helping patients reduce stress, which favorably affects glucose metabolism. For example, the regular practice of Transcendental Meditation\u00ae (TM), reduced insulin resistance in a randomized controlled study of patients with metabolic syndrome. Spices like fenugreek and cinnamon, used often in Indian cooking, can favorably modify glycemic levels. There are a range of other herbs which, when coupled to proper medical, dietary, and behavioral regimens, may contribute to improved glycemic control (Elder C. Altern Ther Health Med. 2004) The best care, then, is an integrated approach merging the best of the Ayurvedic and allopathic paradigms. At Maharishi International University, our Fellowship MS in Integrative Medicine and Ayurveda for Medical Professionals provides doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and other clinicians with the knowledge base and skills to deliver top notch care that is contemporary and scientific, while at the same time ancient and holistic. Charles Elder, MD, MPH, FACP is the Executive Director of the Fellowship MS in Integrative Medicine and Ayurveda for Medical Professionals at Maharishi International University. He received his MD and MPH degrees from Boston University, did his residency training in internal medicine at the University of Michigan, and served as a primary care physician atKaiser Permanente Northwest for 30 years. Early in 2021, roughly one year after authorities declared Covid-19 a pandemic, a lot of people left their jobs, and business leaders began fretting about \"the Great Resignation,\" also known as \"the Big Quit.\" Politicians, economists, and social scientists offered a wide range of plausible explanations: people had gotten used to spending time at home and wanted better work-life balance; the break gave workers a chance to re-assess their priorities and reassert their value; wages had not kept pace with living costs; compensation was not commensurate with hassle; the pandemic encouraged laziness. And on and on. To some extent, all of these factors may be influencing the situation. But the experts missed one of the most important factors: post-viral fatigue. Simply put, many people have experienced\u2014and continue to experience-profound multi-system fatigue following infection with SARS-CoV-2. As is the case with other viral pathogens, this one can render people profoundly debilitated and, in many cases, unable to return to work. A Widespread Problem I believe the Great Resignation isn't happening because people are lazy; it is happening in large part because many people are burdened with chronic illness. Countless infections can trigger persistent chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia (CFS/FMS). For example, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Herpes simplex (HSV-1), Lyme disease, and even polio have been implicated. We can now add SARS-CoV-2 to this list. Between 10 to 15% of people who've had Covid-19 develop persistent exhaustion, as part of the syndrome we're now calling Long Covid. Unfortunately, our healthcare system seems to be treating Long Covid in the same way it has always treated CFS/FMS. Essentially, it is \"gaslighting\" people, telling them they are depressed or lazy. Historically, physicians have done this for complex, poorly understood, and time-intensive conditions, especially when they affect women and when they're not easily diagnosed or quickly treated with profitable drugs or procedures. Some examples? Multiple sclerosis used to be called \"hysterical paralysis.\" When I was in medical school, Lupus was still considered a neurosis. With CFS/FMS, patients often go for years without the correct diagnosis or thorough treatment. Too often, their doctors abusively insinuate that, \"since I don't know what's wrong with you, you must be crazy.\" This is now occurring with Long Covid as well. Long Covid carries considerable social stigma. A recent UK study of nearly 900 such patients showed that 95% experienced stigma at least sometimes, and 76% experienced it often. Practitioners may unintentionally contribute to the problem by failing to recognize that CFS/FM is rooted in actual post-viral pathophysiology, leading patients to believe their fatigue is a character flaw. Exhaustion & Insomnia Part of the challenge in treating post-Covid fatigue is that it is seldom an \"all or nothing\" condition, where people are either totally disabled or \"just fine.\" Many are \"walking wounded\", so to speak. They're marginally functional, but far from their pre-Covid energy levels. Despite the fatigue, many have difficulty sleeping. A Cleveland Clinic study just published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine shows that 40% of a cohort of 962 patients with Long Covid have moderate to severe sleep problems. The paradox of chronic exhaustion with insomnia is a typical feature of post-viral FM/CFS. The insomnia, along with brain fog, chronic pain, and weight gain, indicate hypothalamic dysfunction. When someone is overloaded by viral infections, other types of infections, or extreme stress, the hypothalamus basically shuts down and the body loses one of it's key 'circuit-breakers'. This key control center in the brain regulates sleep, along with hormonal and autonomic function. But it's a tricky situation because in the first year after a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients may experience hypersomnolence, which later gives way to insomnia. I've created a simple 10-minute free quiz to help people make a CFS/FMS diagnosis. There's also an easy-to-use one-page checklist for determining if someone meets the American College of Rheumatology's 2016 diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia. Though these tools are for CFS and FM in general, and not specific to Long Covid, they can be helpful in the post-Covid context. The acronym stands for: Sleep, Hormones (and Hypotension), Infections, Nutrition, and Exercise. By addressing these five domains, we can greatly improve the health of people with post-viral CFS. SHINE includes supplements, botanicals, hormonal therapies and in some cases, antivirals, antifungals, antidepressants, and drugs for sleep. Exercise also plays a role. The basic protocol includes a multivitamin, magnesium plus malic acid, melatonin, and a Valerian/Melissa combination. But there are many additional options depending on an individual's test results and clinical history. I've written a number of articles on applying the SHINE protocol at the patient care level. If you're interested in learning how, email me at FatigueDoc@gmail.com Ginseng Revival One herb that I've found to be particularly helpful for CFS/FM is Panax ginseng. For centuries, Ginseng has been one of most popular herbal medicines in Asia, and for good reason: it can be dramatically effective for numerous conditions. The problem is that for wild ginseng, it takes at least 17 years for a plant to mature and to develop high levels of active ginsenosides in response to harsh weather, threats from insects, and other challenges. And since it is the root portion that we use therapeutically, harvesting usually means ending the life of the plant. Decades ago, over-harvesting of wild ginseng led to insane prices (over $700 a pound), encouraged adulterations and substitutions, and essentially drove the plant to the brink of extinction. In response, farmers began cultivating ginseng, but I found that products derived from farmed ginseng just weren't as effective as those from wild plants. Because of this, I stopped using ginseng in my practice over 30 years ago. Recently, cultivators developed a unique and ingenious aquaponic farming technique which reproduces the challenges the plants face in the wild. It results in a form of farmed ginseng, called HRG80TM Red Ginseng, that has the same active phytochemical profile as mature wild plants. Initially skeptical when I first tried it, I was shocked at how effective it was. Enough so, that I decided to do an open-label study using the product with 188 patients with severe post-viral CFS. Prior to treatment, all patients reported that they were functioning at 50% or less of their pre-illness energy levels. They supplemented with 200-400 mg of the HRG80 in capsule form, or 100-200 mg in tablet form, daily for one month. The results speak for themselves: 60% rated themselves as \"improved,\" with 13% rating themselves \"much better\" (p<.001) 67% average increase in energy 44% average increase in overall well-being 48% average improvement in mental clarity 46% average improvement in sleep 33% average decrease in pain 72% average increase in stamina The bottom line is, this unique form of aquaponically-grown red ginseng resulted in marked improvements in people with disabling fatigue, including post-viral fatigue. Of the two delivery forms (capsule or tablet), I prefer the chewable tablets. They contain natural gamma cyclodextrin, which increases absorption almost eightfold. That means, one half to one tablet can be as effective as four capsules. Important Considerations Botanicals like ginseng, and other supplements, can be a big help in recovering from post-viral CFS/FM. But there are many other important things to consider: Consider adrenal fatigue if the person gets irritable when hungry (\"Hangry\"). Give thyroid & reproductive hormone support if symptoms suggest they are needed. Address orthostatic intolerance (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)): This is common. Here's a quick POTS screening method you can do in the office or even have patients do at home. Ask the patient to lie supine quietly for 10 minutes, then check the pulse and blood pressure. Then, ask the patient to stand up and check the pulse and BP again, every two minutes, for 10 minutes. If the pulse goes up by 15 BPM any time during the 10-minute standing period, it is suggestive of orthostatic intolerance. If it goes up 30 BPM or more, it confirms the diagnosis. A drop of more than 10 points in systolic BP is also suggestive. Covid-related CFS/FMS is more likely in people who felt they needed to push through the acute infection phase, instead of resting. It's so important to let patients know that rest is critical when fighting off a viral pathogen\u2014or any bug, for that matter. Metformin may also have a role in preventing Long Covid. According to a large phase 3 treatment trial of 663 overweight people in TheLancet earlier this year, metformin reduced incidence of long Covid by half, if the drug was given within the first four days of acute symptoms. When starting patients on metformin, I begin with 500 mg on the first day, to make sure that nausea or diarrhea are not severe, and then increase the dose to 500 mg twice a day for 4 days. From there, I increase to 500 mg each morning and 1000 mg at bedtime for a total of two weeks. Metformin is especially important for people who already have CFS/FMS, to decrease the risk of a flare. END Jacob Teitelbaum, MD, is one of the world's most frequently quoted integrative medical authorities. He is the author of several best-sellers, including From Fatigued to Fantastic!, the Beat Sugar Addiction Now! series, The Fatigue and Fibromyalgia Solution, and the popular free smartphone app Cures A-Z. He is the lead author of 4 studies on effective treatment for CFS/FM. In 1975, an extended bout of post-viral CFS left him homeless. He has dedicated his life to researching and writing about effective treatments for CFS/FM. Dr. Teitelbaum earned his MD from Ohio State University, and recently celebrated his 50th year as a physician. Holistic Primary Care honors the fruitful life, and laments the untimely death, of Michael A. Stroka, co-founder and CEO of the American Nutrition Association (ANA). A tireless advocate for the principle of Food-as-Medicine, Stroka accomplished much in his 53 years. With combined JD and MBA degrees from the University of Virginia, Michael began his career as a project leader for Boston Consulting Group (BCG), a strategic management firm that helps companies worldwide solve major business challenges. The job took him all over the US, and many parts of Asia. A business trip to Indonesia awakened him to the profound impact of nutrition and holistic medicine. Something he ate from a street vendor there led to severe food poisoning, and later to chronic fatigue and extreme weakness. His health deteriorated to the point that he had to leave BCG, and the intense but exciting work he enjoyed. In his quest to recover, Stroka quickly ran into the limitations of conventional medicine. \"I saw every kind of doctor in the medical system. No one could bring me back to health,\" he said in an interview posted on the UVA/Darden School of Business website. \"Michael was not only an incredible ally...but also a personal friend to many of us. His passion, dedication, and intellect touched the lives of so many in his professional and personal life.\" -Integrative Healthcare Policy Consortium It was a nutritionist who focused intensively on his diet that ultimately turned the situation around. Soon after making major dietary changes, he began to feel better than he ever had. This direct experience sparked an intense interest to learn more about nutrition, and ultimately to make a career change. He went back to school and became a Certified Nutrition Specialist. A Natural Bridge-Builder It wasn't long until he saw that despite its potential to transform peoples' lives, nutrition science remained in the margins of American healthcare. Practice guidelines give lip-service to the importance of \"healthy lifestyle,\" but the systems put little attention or money toward nutrition in practice. \"Conventional medicine is amazing for acute conditions, but the vast majority of the problems we have are chronic conditions for which nutrition is crucial. The science shows nutrition is the most powerful lever for our health, but health care attention to it is miniscule,\" Stroka said. Part of the problem, he soon realized, is that the nutrition field was fragmented, with a dizzying number of credentials, food philosophies, and \"tribes\" competing for credibility and for practice opportunities. In this muddled situation, Stroka recognized an opportunity to apply the strategic thinking and business acumen he'd honed during his years as a consultant. With several other like-minded nutrition professionals, he established the ANA which brought together five previously separate organizations\u2014the American College of Nutrition, Board for Certification of Nutrition Specialists, Accreditation Council for Nutrition Professional Education, Center for Nutrition Advocacy, and the Nutrition for Optimal Health Association\u2014under a single banner, and with a unified vision. ANA promotes the science and practice of personalized nutrition through education, certification, and public policy advocacy. With a staff of 150, and thousands of members, ANA brought coherence to a previously chaotic field. Among Stroka's many goals was to harmonize and standardize the credentialling criteria for non-RD nutrition professionals, and to ensure that they had a place in healthcare at large. Beloved Colleague To say he was beloved by his colleagues and coworkers is an understatement. \"Michael was an extraordinary person, radiating love and peace to all. It was Michael's visionary leadership that led to the American Nutrition Association coming to fruition,\" writes Joye Blount, Chair of the ANA's Board of Directors. In their public statement, the board members of the Integrative Healthcare Policy Consortium (IHPC) said: \"Michael was not only an incredible ally of IHPC, but also a personal friend to many of us. His passion, dedication, and intellect touched the lives of so many in his professional and personal life.\" A natural bridge-builder, Michael was an active participant in several holistic and functional medicine organizations. I would often see him at conferences, and I was consistently impressed with the energy he brought to his work, the clarity of his vision for moving nutrition to healthcare's center stage, and the practical steps he and his ANA colleagues were taking to make that vision a reality. His boundless enthusiasm for nutrition was only exceeded by his love for his family. Michael was a devoted husband to his wife, Nancy, and a caring, engaged father to their four children: William, Elizabeth, Margaret, and Edward. He enjoyed putting on magic shows and sharing music with his kids, and spending time in nature. He also maintained close ties with his seven siblings. Though fully engaged in the rough-and-tumble of life, Michael was also a deeply reflective and spiritual man, practicing meditation daily and working with teachings that ranged from the Advaita Vedanta to the Carmelite contemplations of Sister Bernadette Roberts. Directly, and indirectly through his work, Michael Stroka positively affected many, many people. May his family and friends be comforted by his memory, and consoled in knowing that his vision and his work will carry on far into the future. Psychedelics have been hitting the headlines nonstop these days. The New York Times, and other major media, have run a slew of articles highlighting the promise of psychedelics for hard-to-treat clinical conditions like major depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and addiction. And that's despite the fact that the vast majority of psychedelics remain classified as Schedule 1, a category of drugs defined as having \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\" \"Wait,\" you may be asking. \"Didn't you just say psychedelics show benefit as one of the most promising treatments we've seen for addiction?!\" Yes. And therein lies the rub. On the one hand, growing research shows that these therapies may offer profound relief to people for whom countless other approaches, conventional and otherwise, have failed. On the other hand, psychedelics remain stigmatized and illegal in most cities and states, though that is slowly shifting as part of a national decriminalization effort. In many ways, the uncertainty\u2014and a person's ability to surrender to the unknown\u2014is the whole point of the treatment. The unique individuality of the experience is exactly what makes it so powerful . That's very different from the linear, rational certainty we learned in medical school. Not unlike the cannabis craze a few years ago, the current \"psychedelic renaissance,\" as it's been called, is leaving a lot of us wondering how to navigate conversations with our patients about psychedelics. Though the current research is tremendously promising, there is still much more to learn about psychedelics than many advocates admit. At the same time, there's also less to fear than we've been told. The Power of Uncertainty As clinicians, we are accustomed to having a reasonable set of expectations about the benefits and risks of the treatments we recommend. From that perspective, guiding patients who seek psychedelic healing experiences-whether at home or in the jungles of Peru-is paradoxical to the risk-averse mindset we've all internalized. That's because, despite the growing research, we cannot predict exactly what will happen to a particular person during a journey, nor can we be certain the experience will leave the journeyer better off than before. Psychedelic experiences are inherently individual, subjective, and not predictable. In many ways, the uncertainty\u2014and a person's ability to surrender to the unknown\u2014is the whole point of the treatment. The unique individuality of the experience is exactly what makes it so powerful and transformative. Yikes! That's very different from the linear, rational certainty we learned in medical school. So what's a clinician to do? Seeking the Big Shift These days, many (most!) of us are overwhelmed with patients struggling with chronic physical and mental health conditions that require more than the current medical paradigm offers. These patients have been through a full array of pharmaceuticals, psychotherapy, integrative approaches, and more, none of which have fully resolved their problems or restored their health. Something more is likely going on. And now we're learning that traumatic experiences (whether \"big T\" or \"little t\" traumas) can trigger a persistent cell danger response that manifests physically and mentally, until something shifts the person out of that state. Patients are also learning about this phenomenon, and they want that big shift via psychedelic experiences. Many also want our guidance about the potential benefits and risks. As practitioners, we cannot ignore the potential to help people that are suffering deeply, even if we have hesitations. The good news is that there's not just one way to experience the benefits of psychedelics and \"Master Plants,\" as they're called by many of the indigenous cultures who have worked with them for millennia. Master Plants are plants and fungi that produce neuroactive substances that, when ingested, inhaled, or applied, affect human consciousness. Most people hear the word \"psychedelics\" and automatically think of what are referred to as peak experiences or \"tripping\" - states of profoundly altered reality, visual or auditory hallucinations that render someone out-of-commission for the duration. They think that this is the only way psychedelics \"work.\" Macrodosing for peak experiences is not the only way people have traditionally engaged with Master Plants. If you study the long history of human interaction with these plants, you'll find a tremendous precedent for use of much smaller doses. Some seek these big experiences whether for therapeutic, spiritual, or recreational reasons. And indeed, there's research to show that within a context of a therapeutic support before, during, and afterwards, full-on psychedelic experiences can be profoundly transformative and healing. Yet macrodosing for peak experiences is not the only way people have traditionally engaged with Master Plants. If you study the long history of human interaction with these plants, you'll find a tremendous precedent for use of much smaller doses. What are Master Plants? In their indigenous communities of origin, naturally-occurring psychedelics are referred to not as \"drugs\" but as Master or Teacher Plants. In some cultures, they're called Grandmother or Grandfather, Mother or Father. They're considered to be very old and powerful kin; they convey an ancient wisdom and lineage that can help individuals to heal and communities to evolve. Some examples of psychedelic Master Plants include psilocybe mushrooms, ayahuasca, San Pedro cactus, peyote, iboga, and salvia, among others. Not all Master Plants are psychedelic (think cacao, opium poppy, or the coca plant), but all psychedelic plants are considered to be masters In contrast to the way we perceive medicine in modern industrialized culture, these plants are not exploitable resources that produce \"compounds\" to be \"taken\" or \"used\"; they are revered community members- honored elders, teachers, and allies. As such, people approach them with extreme reverence and humility, with offerings in hand. The healing benefits are considered sacred gifts from the plants. Indigenous Science Skeptical? That's no surprise. Those of us from the Global North have long operated under the assumption that indigenous peoples\u2014particularly those from the Global South-are primitive, backward, or \"undeveloped.\" That's partly because they are preliterate or extra-literate, and thus unschooled in the European literature, history, and science that comprise an \"acceptable\" education in our cultures. By this logic, indigenous communities have no science, technology, or advanced forms of knowledge. Those assumptions are worth challenging in any conversation about psychedelic medicine, because indigenous knowledge is the past, present, and must remain a fundamental part of the future of our engagement with Master Plants, if it is to be safe and truly therapeutic. The prevailing beliefs about \"primitive\" people conveniently ignore the truth that many of our modern scientific \"discoveries,\" including awareness of psychedelics, have their roots in ancient indigenous knowledge. At least 75% of pharmaceutical companies' plant-based remedies are derived from knowledge taken from indigenous societies. Fewer than 2% of all the world's plants have been fully explored to date. The vast majority of those plants live in tropical forests inhabited by indigenous communities. Indeed, these communities remain the source of many current and future therapies. That's why pharma development companies employ \"bioprospectors.\" Let's consider ayahuasca, for example. The word translates roughly from Quechuan as \"spirit/soul rope,\" and this plant medicine has become increasingly popular in the US and Europe among seekers of deep healing and profound shifts in consciousness. Many people may not realize that the ayahuasca vine (Banisteriopsis caapi) alone has no significant hallucinogenic activity. To make the psychoactive substance called \"ayahuasca\" that's been prepared for millennia by South American indigenous people, two plants must be brewed together in a highly specialized way for hours. One of those plants often used in the Amazon is called chacruna (Psychotria viridis). It contains the hallucinogenic substance dimethyltryptamine (DMT). like the ayahuasca plant, chacruna alone has no hallucinogenic effect when taken orally. That's because the monoamine oxidase in our stomachs breaks down the DMT. The combination of the two plants is a whole other story. The ayahuasca vine contains compounds that render this enzyme inactive, so the DMT can survive digestion, penetrate systemic circulation, and enter the brain's inner sanctum. Indigenous peoples may not be able to explain the biochemistry behind this phenomenon, but they certainly have advanced knowledge of how and why these plants must be prepared together. Think about it: there are at least 100,000 plant varieties in the Amazonian jungle alone. Yet, somehow, unrelated indigenous communities isolated from one another, discovered not only the relatively nondescript ayahuasca vine but also the possibility of combining it with just the right second plant, and the hours-long process needed for preparing them together to have a psychedelic effect. When asked how they obtained this intricate, detailed, and very specific knowledge, indigenous people will say the Master Plants showed them. And yes, they mean this literally. Remember, for them, the plants are not just passive objects that produce useful compounds, they are intelligent beings with spirits. There are at least 100,000 plant varieties in the Amazonian jungle alone. Yet, somehow, unrelated indigenous communities discovered not only the relatively nondescript ayahuasca vine but also the possibility of combining it with just the right second plant, and the hours-long process needed for preparing them together to have a psychedelic effect. This is a lot to take in, I know. But the reverence and knowledge these communities show in their relationship with Master Plants has served them well for millennia. It's a deep contrast to the psychedelic free-for-all that took place here in the 1950s and 60s, when LSD and other psychedelics blasted onto the scene, and drastically different from the current venture capital-fueled psychedelic business frenzy. Plant Intelligence Most people in modern industrialized societies don't realize that plants do in fact possess a \"brain.\" It may not be in the form of a solid organ, as it is for us. But plants have neural networks - their root systems. In their roots, plants store memories, analyze inputs, design responses, and plan for the future. Structurally, plant root systems closely resemble the neural networks of our brains, and they perform similar functions. They produce neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, melatonin, acetylcholine, GABA and even the psychedelic molecule DMT. Since we humans like to define other beings in anthropomorphic terms, we could think of plants as upside down beings- their \"brains\" underneath the soil, their limbs and genitalia (yep, flowers!) visible to us. This idea that plants sense their environments and have intelligence is not new, even to \"modern\" science. There was a scientist, albeit a controversial one, who described the neural nature of plant root systems in his 1880 book, The Power of Movement of Plants. His name was Charles Darwin. Small Doses, Big Impact Indigenous customs and practices for interacting with psychoactive plants can vary widely from culture to culture. In certain communities, only the healer ingests the medicine in a significant \"shamanic\" quantity, which confers the ability to see inside the person needing healing. Sometimes, the person or people in need of healing might ingest a small amount. But often they ingest none at all, yet still have full healing experiences. Indigenous people have long recognized\u2014and everyone else is slowly learning\u2014that sometimes our physiology will respond best to a gentle nudge rather than a sledgehammer blow. The concept of microdosing psychedelics has gained attention recently, popularized by Silicon Valley professionals as a way to get to that \"next level.\" Microdosing means ingesting a subthreshold dose that will not induce profound changes or alter one's normal daily functions, but will still have physiological and cognitive effects. People are now exploring psychedelic microdosing as a way to enhance cognition; boost physical energy; promote emotional balance; treat anxiety, depression, OCD, and addiction; and even address medical conditions like chronic pain, autoimmunity, asthma, dementia, ADHD, or autism. People are now exploring psychedelic microdosing as a way to enhance cognition; boost physical energy; promote emotional balance; treat anxiety, depression, OCD, and addiction; and even address medical conditions like chronic pain, autoimmunity, asthma, dementia, ADHD, or autism. Microdosing may, in fact, prove to be more effective than macrodosing for some conditions. Those who regard Master Plants bluntly as neurochemical compounds can get stuck in the \"more is more\" perspective. Yet early research indicates that microdosing offers hormetic effects, in which a seemingly insignificant dose leads to big benefits. Microdosing may, in fact, prove to be more effective than macrodosing for some conditions. For example, animal studies show that microdoses of psilocybin confer anti-inflammatory effects not seen with larger doses. Small amounts over time may offer cumulative benefits that larger doses do not. Researchers have discovered a profound shift in T-helper cell recruitment, eosinophilia, and mucus production in the lungs of people with asthma who took microdoses of 5-HT2A receptor agonists that mimic psychedelic molecules. Most plant researchers have disregarded these oscillations as inconvenient \"noise\" or interference. Yet these vibrational transmissions may be as much a communicative expression as the complex chemical compounds that plants produce, and that we consider to be \"medicine.\" Under the right circumstances, we can access this vast spectrum of plant communication. For trained ayahuasqueros and other indigenous wisdom holders, to perceive this music is as potent a medicine as the ingestion of the actual plants themselves; in fact, many consider medicine songs transmitted to them by plants to be equal to or greater in power as imbibing Master Plants in physical form. Receiving the plant vibrations is a foundational avenue to profound healing, without ingesting plant material at all. Modern biomedical science points to chemical compounds as the sole source of a plant's medicinal (or nutritional) value. Indigenous science views the medicine of the plants as coming from the Mother of the plant, also referred to as the plant's spirit. According to this paradigm, it's more than just a material or biochemical substance, and beyond even an essence or an energy. The plant is considered to have intelligence and even sentience. A form of quantum dosing takes place in traditional settings through music, which is thought to be vibrational medicine given over by the Mother of a Master Plant. The Quechua word for this vibrational medicine is \u00edcaro, which derives from the word for \"to blow.\" \"Everything is created by music, by vibration, by sound. When the celestial spirits enlighten us with their wisdom, we receive the ability to sing \u00edcaros and we become part of a divine choir. Music is universal, and we are made of primordial vibration. \u00cdcaros are the music of creation.\" -Pablo Amaringo, Peruvian shaman and artist \u00cdcaros are the vibrations of the plant manifested through the Maestro (the healer and leader of an ayahuasca ceremony), in the form of songs that the healer sings or whistles, especially during ayahuasca ceremonies. To be clear, these are considered vibrational transmissions not composed by the Maestro, but offered by the Master Plants over intensive weeks or months spent training together\u2014a period known as dietas. These \u00edcaros serve different functions at the start, the middle, and the end of a ceremony- to provoke visions, to encourage purging and release, and to return to the physical body. In the words of the indigenous shaman and artist Pablo Amaringo: \"Everything is created by music, by vibration, by sound. When the celestial spirits enlighten us with their wisdom, we receive the ability to sing \u00edcaros and we become part of a divine choir. Music is universal, and we are made of primordial vibration. \u00cdcaros are the music of creation.\" Though the term \"quantum\" has been thrown around liberally by marketers and new-agers alike, it has real meaning. Quantum physics describes the behavior of the very smallest detectable particles, acknowledging that they embody both matter and wave state simultaneously. These tight packets of wave energy, known as \"quanta,\" act in ways that are nonlinear and nonlocal, helping us to explain complex phenomena that are otherwise inexplicable with classical physics. The burgeoning field of quantum science takes into account the vibration and frequency of our bodies, and the impact of vibration and frequency, including light, sound, and biofield on human physiology and consciousness. Nobel Prize winner Luc Montaigner's controversial work with water is informing a new wave of research regarding the imprinting of DNA information into water. The oscillations of Master Plants can be imprinted into liquid and then consumed. Ingesting these in the form of quantum drops are another way to experience quantum dosing. It represents another form of vibrational medicine, made together with plants that are never harvested for ingestion. In appreciation for this care, the Master Plants infuse the drops with this ceremonial relationship in the form of sonic medicine. This is similar to the principle behind the Bach Flower Remedies, or other flower essence therapies. Master Plants can share their medicine and teachings in ways that don't overdrive our nervous systems, and don't overuse the plants or turn them into pharmaceuticals or commodities to be exploited. Growing Master Plants that are legal to grow\u2014such as ayahuasca or San Pedro-and tending them, engaging with their seeds, and even creating or wearing artistic depictions of them are all ways to experience their gifts. Quantum dosing is vibrational and, therefore, legal. It is also safe for people who are highly sensitive, sober, pregnant, or have other medical or pharmaceutical contraindications to the ingestion of psychedelic substances. It is also helpful in preparing for a ceremony, and for the integration process afterward. It remains to be seen whether quantum dosing can give the benefits observed in studies of macrodosing and microdosing. Likewise, we don't yet know whether quantum dosing offers benefits not seen with ingestion of plant substances. All of this is very likely arousing your skepticism, but don't let that dissuade you from exploring. Consider what we have only recently learned about the microbiome. Thirty years ago, could we have imagined that our cognition, memory, moods, cravings, immunity, hormones, and sleep cycles are governed in large part by microbes in our intestines? Early microbiome research also aroused skepticism and scorn. Of course, all of this raises big existential questions: What are we, really? Who's in charge? Where do we end and the rest of the world begins? We think of ourselves as static. But ancient indigenous wisdom\u2014and also our most advanced science\u2014shows us that we are universes within universes within universes, far more complex than an amalgam of organ systems mechanically doing their parts. Deepening our relationship with Master Plant wisdom\u2014whether via intense psychedelic experiences, microdosing, or quantum dosing-enables us to cultivate richer relationship with ourselves, each other, and all living beings by enhancing within us a sense of greater awareness, presence, and aliveness. It helps us remember the sacredness of our existence while navigating the challenges of our ordinary human lives. And this can be profoundly therapeutic. Government agencies and medical organizations have yet to reach consensus on formal definitions of Long Covid, and there is considerable debate about its prevalence and its risk factors. But by any accounting, it is a significant public health problem. According to the World Health Organization, up to 10% of all people who've had Covid have persistent symptoms three months (90 days) or more after acute infection. Roughly 2% still have symptoms at 12 months. The Centers for Disease Control defines Long Covid as the presence of symptoms 30 days post-acute infection. By that definition, one in five US adults have (or have had) Long Covid. Recent reports suggest that incidence may be on the wane. According to a national survey of more than 60,000 individuals by the Census Bureau and the National Center for Health Statistics, the number of Covid patients who report long-term symptoms declined from 35% to 28% between June 2022 and January 2023. That's a positive signal, but on a population basis, the Long Covid numbers are still massive. And official figures may underestimate the problem, because cases only show up in epidemiological databases when practitioners diagnose them and code for them properly. Given that many Long Covid symptoms overlap other disorders, a lot of cases may not be properly logged. A Chaotic Situation There are upwards of 200 distinct symptoms linked with the post-Covid syndrome, and they can affect nearly every organ system. Though sometimes disabling, they're often diffuse and episodic, appearing, disappearing, and reappearing in seemingly random manner. And unlike the acute infection, there is no definitive \"yes or no\" test for Long Covid. In May, the National Institutes of Health published the first data from the Researching Covid to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) project. Based on records from nearly 10,000 adults, the paper is NIH's first attempt to formally define the post-Covid syndrome, catalog its most common symptoms, identify who's at risk, and provide direction for future clinical guidelines and research projects. On a practical level, though, RECOVER offers little to help practitioners right now. For patients, questions about the formal definition are academic: they simply know that their health cratered after having Covid. They want help, and they have trouble finding it. A Coherent Framework Over the last year, a working group of functional medicine practitioners came together to review the world's literature, compare clinical experiences, and lay groundwork for a comprehensive therapeutic approach to Long Covid. \"The five pathophysiological drivers give us points of orientation for treatment\" The 10-member PVRP working group was directed by OvationLab's Laurie Hofmann, MPH, and included Patrick Hanaway, MD, Kara Parker, MD, Michael Stone, MD, and Kristine Burke, MD. The group defines Long Covid as \"diverse symptoms of new, returning, or ongoing health problems...after an acute Covid infection.\" The protocols they developed are centered around the core observation that there are five main physiological drivers underlying the syndrome and its myriad manifestations: ACE2-mediated tissue damage Viral persistence Chronic inflammation Microbiome dysbiosis Mitochondrial dysfunction These basic processes are inter-related, and often concurrent (Fig.1). For example, ACE2-mediated tissue damage in one or more organs can trigger chronic, systemic inflammation. Likewise, the presence of persistent viral particles drives immune system dysregulation which feeds the inflammatory cascade. All of the above can disrupt the gut microbiome, resulting in dysbiosis, which adds to the symptom burden. \"The five pathophysiological drivers give us points of orientation for treatment,\" says Hanaway, formerly the chief medical education officer of the Institute for Functional Medicine, and founding medical director of the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine. He and other Working Group members described the PVRP principles and protocols in a series of three free webinars sponsored by ANDHealth and supported by all of the major functional and integrative medicine education organizations. \"If there's ongoing tissue damage, we can treat it. If there's evidence of viral persistence, can we identify the pathogen or pathogens and focus there. If there's chronic inflammation, we need to define what's out of balance and take steps to rectify that. Same for the microbiome. And then there's supporting the mitochondria. These factors all overlap, you can't just focus on one aspect because they're all inter-related.\" Working group members recognized that Long Covid shares features with other post-viral syndromes, and that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 often reactivates latent sequestered viruses like EBV, Herpes, and Varicella. Though Long Covid has its own unique characteristics, lessons from post-acute EBV, chronic fatigue, other coronavirus-related diseases, and even Lyme disease, have relevance in this context. Who's at Risk? \"We know that people who had more severe SARS CoV-2 infection are more likely to get long Covid,\" says Dr. Hanaway. \"However, we find that about two-thirds of those 2 million-plus people who have Long Covid actually had mild cases of acute SARS CoV-2.\" That's in part because, statistically, far more people had mild versus severe primary infections. The point is, long term problems often develop in people who had mild initial infections. Obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and/or cardiovascular disease raise the risk of Long Covid, as does having a history pre-Covid CFS or other post-viral syndromes. \"If we talk to people and get their clinical histories, we can predict who's going to get Long Covid with 95% accuracy.\" -Patrick Hanaway, MD In 2022, researchers at the Institute for Systems Biology published a study looking at potential predictive factors for Long Covid in a cohort of 309 patients. They identified four factors-type 2 diabetes, presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia, Epstein-Barr virus viremia, and presence of specific auto-antibodies as highly predictive (Su Y, et al. Cell. 2022). They also found that patients with severe post-Covid GI problems, show a unique expansion of cytotoxic T-cells measurable during the acute phase of illness. All that said, roughly one-third of people with Long Covid have no pre-existing conditions or major risk factors at the time of primary infection. Assessing Long Covid There are no definitive tests for Long Covid. The Working Group says practitioners can rule out other potential etiologies and concerns from the following basic lab tests: Complete blood count (with D-dimer; Fibrinogen; high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein, Vitamin D, Thyroid hormones. Viewed in context of a patient's history and timeline, these tests can tell a lot about the patterns of tissue damage, pathogenic reactivation, inflammatory and autoimmune processes, dysbiosis, and mitochondrial function. Several research groups contend there are distinct \"endotypes\" or \"immunophenotypes\" of Long Covid, identifiable by particular cytokine profiles, autoantibodies, and cellular activation phenotypes. In a landmark 2021 paper, Proal and VanElzakker propose that lab testing can predict which patients will likely have clotting and vascular problems, or impairment of brain and vagal nerve function, or viral reactivations, or Iwasaki and colleagues at Yale School of Medicine showed that by measuring cytokines and markers of cellular activation, they could predict 96% of Long Covid cases in a cohort of 215 individuals. (Klein JB, et al. MedRxiv. 2022). According to the PVRP Working Group, immunophenotyping may be valuable for research, but it is seldom needed for routine patient care. Assessing Functional Status \"If we talk to people and get their clinical histories, we can predict who's going to get Long Covid with 95% accuracy. We don't need all of the sophisticated immunophenotyping. It won't really change what we're going to do,\" says Dr. Hanaway. Lab data needs to be viewed in the context of a patient's symptom patterns and functional status. The PVRP Working Group advocates routine use of the PROMIS-29 (Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System), through which patients can self-assess seven key domains-pain, fatigue, physical function, sleep, anxiety, depression, and social wellbeing\u2014with simple point-rating scales. Make sure to evaluate exercise tolerance, Hanaway added. Movement is vital for restoration of health, but it needs to be carefully tailored to a patient's abilities and functional status. Too much can be as problematic as too little. ACE2-Mediated Tissue Damage All five drivers play a role in the pathogenesis of Long Covid, to varying degrees. But ACE-2 mediated tissue damage is, arguably, the most central to the disease process. SARS-CoV-2 can enter any organ containing tissue that expresses ACE2 receptors. This means the heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, brain, and tissues throughout the GI tract are vulnerable to viral invasion, inflammation, and damage. Virally-induced tissue injury leads to immune system dysregulation, which causes further tissue damage. \"It's a feed-forward process,\" says Dr. Hanaway. SARS-CoV-2 can enter any organ containing tissue that expresses ACE2 receptors. This means the heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, brain, and tissues throughout the GI tract are vulnerable to viral invasion, inflammation, and damage. According to Harry Crook and colleagues at the Imperial College, London, that simple fact goes a long way in explaining the diversity of Long Covid symptoms (Crook H, et al. BMJ, 2021). (Fig 2). A 2021 study of 201 people following acute Covid showed that 66% had MRI evidence of damage in the heart, liver, pancreas, kidneys, or spleen 4 months after infection. Many had multi-organ involvement (Dennis A, et al. BMJ Open. 2021). In an excellent review article, Malaysian researchers noted that in the brain, the brainstem region shows the highest density of ACE2 receptors. Viral damage to the brainstem worsens acute Covid, and may underlie longer term neurological and cognitive changes (Yong SJ, Infect Dis (Lond). 2021). Neuroinflammation may be triggered directly by the virus, or it may be secondary to generalized systemic inflammation, said Dr. Hanaway. It accounts for many of the common symptoms that patients experience: brain fog, sleep disturbances, chronic distress, and anxiety. The myocardium, which expresses high levels of ACE2, is also vulnerable. In a study of 79 Covid survivors, 29% showed radiological evidence of ventricular remodeling (Moody WE, et al. J Am Soc Echocardiog. 2021). Persistent cardiac symptoms like chest pain, palpitations, and tachycardia are common Long Covid. So far, there is no evidence of long-term sequestration of whole SARS-CoV-2 virus in human tissue. But researchers have identified a number of specific viral protein fragments that hang around long after the acute illness phase. These can trigger and perpetuate inflammatory responses. Treating Long Covid There's no simple \"magic bullet\" treatment for Long Covid. Restoring health in the wake of SARS-CoV-2 requires a carefully-tailored, long-term, multimodal approach that includes diet and lifestyle changes, attention to sleep hygiene and stress mitigation, movement and exercise, and intensive nutritional support. \"Changing lifestyle and helping people optimize it in the post-Covid context is not just about treating the Covid-related symptoms. It's about preventing future harm and future chronic disease,\" said Kara Parker, MD, of Hennepin Healthcare, Minneapolis, who is a member of the Working Group. \"There's no downside to helping people improve their lifestyles.\" During the PVRP webinars, which had several thousand physician attendees, Dr. Parker reviewed the key lifestyle facets of the PVRP: Food & Nutrition: Plant-based, colorful, and minimally processed are the watchwords for good nutrition following Covid. The PVRP nutrition program is built around the Whole30 plant-based program, which Dr. Parker described as \"simple and well-resourced.\" The plan provides patients with grocery guides, shopping lists, meal planning tools, plant-based recipes, and tips for navigating the inevitable the ups and downs of energy levels. Citing a six-country study of nearly 3,000 healthcare workers that looked at the impact of various diet patterns on Covid severity, Dr. Parker noted that those who had plant-based diets prior to infection had a 72% lower rate of hospitalizations and deaths. Those who were primarily plant-based but also included fish had a 50% reduction, compared to those who routinely consumed a lot of meat, processed foods, sugar, alcohol. In general, plant-based diets reduce HbA1c, increase insulin sensitivity, lower total and LDL cholesterol, improve mood and motivation, downregulate inflammation, reduce BMI, and improve the gut microbiome. All of the above will likely improve the health status of someone dealing with long Covid. The Working Group chose Whole30 because it simplifies plant-based nutrition. There's a strictly vegetarian version, and one that includes some animal protein, giving patients the option based on their preferences and nutritional needs. In general, the Working Group advises: Eliminating processed foods and sweetened beverages as much as possible Time-restricted eating, for those who can tolerate it Low-glycemic meals, to reduce post-prandial glucose surges and inflammation Increasing intake of lactofermented foods, to rebuild the microbiome. The exceptions here are patients whose symptoms are suggestive of mast cell dysregulation. Thse patients should avoid foods that trigger histamine release. This includes most fermented foods, aged cheeses, and leftovers of all sorts Increasing intake of herbs and spices for flavor and medicinal effects. For example, rosmarinic acid in rosemary, thyme, and other herbs, can help rebuild depleted ACE2 receptors. \"Sleep Snacks\": Circadian rhythm dysfunction, combined with the neuroinflammation caused by the virus, aka \"Coronasomnia,\" is rampant these days, said Dr. Parker. It can cause blood brain barrier leakage, which creates a feed-forward cycle of more sleep disruption and further circadian dysregulation. \"With sleep, both quantity and quality matter. Any way that we can help patients improve their sleep hygiene and their deep restoration time, will be important.\" One helpful way to do this is to teach patients about ultradian rhythms\u2014the cyclical ebbs and flows of energy that naturally occur over the course of a day\u2014and to work with these cycles rather than fighting them and \"pushing through.\" Periodic \"sleep snacks\" during the day can be extremely helpful for people who don't sleep well at night. Ultradian breaks need not always be full-on naps. Standing and stretching, yoga postures, walking outdoors, non-caffeinated herbal teas, engaging with a friend or pet, drawing, journaling, reading something enjoyable offscreen, or just giving the mind time to wander, can all be highly restorative. Regarding nutraceuticals for sleep, the Working Group recommends melatonin when appropriate. Not only does it help reset circadian rhythms, it prevents peroxidation of cardiolipin in mitochondrial membranes. Given that mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of Long Covid, this effect would have obvious benefit for these patients. Exercise: \"Movement is certainly a pillar of healing from Long Covid. But you have to be careful in how you message this. People know this, and they want to move, but oftentimes they have severe post exertional malaise, or POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia), or orthostatic hypotension, and movement in the way they used to move is not an option,\" says Dr. Parker. For some, even minor exertion can result in days-long fatigue and symptom relapse. Still, some activity is better than none. The key is to tailor activity to the patient's current energy level, and progress slowly. \"Make goals that are attainable for each patient accommodating the new limitations. Be aware that some patients may feel a lot of grief over the loss of their previously high functional levels. It can be a big, big loss.\" Group Visits: A group visit model enables practitioners to efficiently scale their Long Covid care to help more patients, while simultaneously providing patients with much needed social and emotional support. \"For people experiencing Long Covid to be with other people who understand them, and what they're going through is fantastic,\" says Dr. Parker who's worked with hundreds of patients in groups over the last 3 years. She runs the groups in 7-week series, that includes in-person and virtual visits. The latter, she says are really helpful for these patients, many of whom \"already have a medicalized life, and are often going to lots of visits.\" \"Movement is certainly a pillar of healing from Long Covid. But you have to be careful in how you message this. People know this, and they want to move, but oftentimes they have severe post exertional malaise, or POTS, or orthostatic hypotension, and movement in the way they used to move is not an option,\" -Kara Parker, MD Targeted Supplementation Dietary improvements and other lifestyle changes go a long way in improving someone's general health status post-Covid. But most patients with Long Covid will require a period of intensive supplementation aimed at mitigating the physiological drivers of the condition. In developing their supplement recommendations, the PVRP Working Group made an exhaustive search of the global literature to find safe, evidence-based botanicals and nutraceuticals that would be relevant for and accessible to Long Covid patients. \"We found ourselves needing a curated suite of nutritional product solutions that were targeted at the five main drivers of Long Covid: ACE2 mediated microbiome/dysbiosis,\" said Kristine Burke, MD, a member of the Working Group. \"We're not promoting specific brands necessarily. But the ones on the list, we found data to support the use of each of them to target one or more of the five key drivers,\" she said during the PVRP webinars. The protocols are divided into two sets: Foundational Supplements that include basic vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and products to optimize mitochondrial function; and \"Specialty\" Supplements, which specifically target the five drivers. \"We found ourselves needing a curated suite of nutritional product solutions that were targeted at the five main drivers of Long Covid: ACE2 mediated microbiome/dysbiosis.\" -Kristine Burke, MD The latter list includes some new and unique products, like Tollovid (Todos Medical)\u2014a compound derived from Lithospermum erythrorhizon, an Asian medicinal plant. It binds the 3CL protease that many RNA viruses produce to cleave their RNA. In so doing, it inhibits viral replication, thus targeting the Viral Persistence driver. Another new product called ITIS (Return Healthy) is a combination of anti-inflammatory herbs including Scutellaria (Skullcap), Curcumin, Boswellia, and others. It is unique in that it crosses the blood-brain barrier, meaning that it will help with the cognitive impairment and mood disturbances often seen in Long Covid. It also mitigates inflammation, reduces pain, and improves joint and muscle function. Dr. Parker says that addition of the PVRP supplement regimens can make a major difference over lifestyle changes alone. \"I've seen this over and over again.\" But it is important to recognize that adherence to this 90-day program requires a strong commitment. \"Supplementation is, in fact, a lifestyle change for many patients.\" Origins of the PVRP OvationLab, a consulting firm focused on developing products, services, protocols, and technologies in the functional and integrative medicine field became the hub of the protocol development process because its leaders\u2014Laurie Hofmann, Tom Blue, and Andie Crosby are well-known and well connected in the functional medicine space, and because they began doing surveys on the impact of Covid early on in the pandemic. Hofmann told Holistic Primary Care that she and her colleagues saw an urgent need for a comprehensive, systematized, \"root cause\" approach to the evaluation and treatment of Long Covid. ANDHealth, a private company that specializes in bundling condition-specific, root-cause care services for chronic disease reversal, played a catalytic role in the evolution of PVRP. ANDHealth launched in 2021 and is funded in part by the venture capital arm of the American Medical Association. It provides its services to patients across the socioeconomic spectrum Ovation and ANDHealth already had a working relationship when, in late 2021, AND provided funding to assemble the Long Covid working group. Early in 2022, the team convened what Hofmann called a \"social listening\" study, analyzing over 1 million social media conversations about Covid and its post-acute sequelae, to find out what people were experiencing, what were their greatest concerns, and what were their biggest unmet needs. Simultaneously, the 10-member clinical working group was gathering and assimilating the scientific literature on the post-Covid syndrome, sharing their own patient care experiences, and studying the prevention and treatment recommendations developed earlier in the pandemic by medical organizations like the Institute for Functional Medicine. From this process emerged the identification of the 5 primary physiologic drivers, a standardized set of outcomes measures, the lifestyle recommendations, and the 90-day treatment protocol which are the basic components of the PVRP. Outcomes Research Research is of paramount importance to Ovation and the members of the Working Group. To that end, the group collaborated with National University of Naturopathic Medicine to establish a REDCap patient registry to track and quantify functional outcomes in cohorts of patients as they progress through the PVRP protocols. Last December, the PVRP group began enrolling its first patients, notably Dr. Parker's group visit patients at Hennepin Healthcare, and from numerous clinical practices around the country. The goal is to evaluate patients at 30, 60, and 90 days into the PVRP program, using the PROMIS-29 and post-Covid Function Scale (PCFS). The initial patient intake process is quite thorough, and gathers complete history, lab values, and timeline information, though Parker said the forms are \"specifically written for people with low energy and brain fog.\" As of April 2023, more than 100 patients have enrolled in the registry, and the first cohort has completed the 90-day treatment protocol. The initial outcomes data will help the Working Group revise and refine the protocols. They will also provide the basis for a series of case studies from the project, the first step toward a full-scale, IRB-approved, controlled clinical trial. From a review of 30 patients with Long Covid (average 15 months) who completed the PVRP at 90 days, there was a 40% improvement in scores on the Post Covid Function Scale. Though the group has accomplished much in the last two years, Hofmann stressed that the PVRP is still in an early stage, and the discovery process is ongoing. The program and the protocols continue to be evaluated and refined. \"Right now, we're still in this phase of trying to understand what continues to be an emerging cluster of more than 200 different symptoms, and how to approach them from a systems medicine perspective. It's a very complicated constellation and, it's still very new. There are no proven therapies, no standards of care, and no clinical outcomes data from the NIH RECOVER initative,\" she told Holistic Primary Care. \"There's a window of opportunity now to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. At the same time, I feel very cautious about touting that we have something too soon. We need to continue enrolling patients in the program and the registry to track outcomes. The Long Covid nutritional protocol developed by the 10-member practitioner working group under the aegis of OvationLab and ANDHealth, is divided into two parts\u2014Foundational Supplements aimed at improving overall health, and Specialty Supplements focused on the five main drivers of Long Covid: ACE2-mediated tissue damage; viral persistence; chronic inflammation; microbiome/dysbiosis. The working group is continually re-evaluating and refining the protocol and dosing schedule. The Foundational Supplement protocol includes: MitoCore (Ortho Molecular Products): a comprehensive multivitamin that also Manganese, and Zinc. The working group recommends 2 caps, twice daily for 90 days. OmegaGenics (Metagenics), a concentrated Omega-3 product containing 710 mg EPA and 290 mg DHA; 1,000 mg twice daily for 90 days. Magnesium Glycinate, 200 mg twice daily for 90 days Co-Enzyme Q10, 200 mg per day, for 90 days Quercetin, 500 mg, twice daily for 90 days Vitamin K2 with D3: Up to 10,000 IU daily, with specific dosing based on each patient's serum levels. If the serum level is below 40 ng/ml, use 10,000 IU. If it's within 40-60 ng/ml, use 5,000IU. If above 60 ng/ml, the patient does not need supplementation. The Specialty Supplement protocol consists of: Arterosil (Calroy Health Sciences): The main constituent in Arterosil is Rhamnan sulfate, a sulfated polysaccharide from two marine algae (Monostroma Latissium and Monostroma Nitidum). Rhamnan sulfate has a similar structure to glycosaminoglycans found in the human endothelial glycocalyx\u2014the thin gel-like layer that coats the luminal surfaces of healthy blood vessels. Glycocalyx damage is one of the earliest steps in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, and it is a common consequence of Covid. \"In order to have any hope of repairing tissue damage, we need optimized blood flow and optimized vessel health. Arterosil targets the regeneration and repair of the endothelial glycocalyx,\" said Kristine Burke, MD, a co-chair of the PVRP Working Group, during a webinar outlining the protocols. ITIS (Return Healthy): This product is a complex of anti-inflammatory Burke noted that Scutellaria produces a compound called Baikalin that is able to cross the blood-brain barrier, making the product useful for mitigating the cognitive impairment, mood disturbances, and \"brain fog\" that many Long Covid patients experience. That's in addition to the product's capacity to reduce systemic inflammation, one of the main drivers of the post-viral syndrome. Tollovid (Todos Medical): This unique substance is derived from an herb called Lithospermum erthythrorhizon, known colloquially in English as Gromwell root, or Zicao in Traditional Chinese Medicine. \"Tollovid addresses persistent viral infections by blocking viral replication capacity,\" explained Dr. Burke. It does this by binding tightly to the 3CL protease, an enzyme that coronaviruses use to cleave the long polypeptide chains produced from their mRNA during the replication process. Tollovid is among a number of 3CL inhibitors being explored in the Covid context. Essentially, it shuts down the replication process. MegaSporeBiotic (Microbiome Labs): This probiotic product delivers spores from five strains of Bacillus subtilis. PVRP Working Group members believe it is ideally suited to address the marked microbiome alterations associated with Covid and sometimes, Covid vaccination. \"We want to recondition the gut and bring back a healthier microbiome, especially facilitating the resurgence of those species that are important in immune regulation,\" Burke said. Rather than \"seeding\" the gut with exogenous probiotic organisms, the goal of treatment with a spore-based product like this is to shift the microbial ecology so that it favors growth and flourishing of a patient's own endogenous bacterial species. MegaPre (Microbiome Labs): A prebiotic product containing three different types of non-digestible oligosaccharides derived from kiwi fruit, nonGMO corn cobs, and rBST-free cow's milk. Supplementation with this combination increases GI microbial diversity and selectively feeds beneficial organisms like Akkermansia muciniphilia, Faecalibacterium prauznitzii, and various species of Bifidbacteria which, Dr. Burke noted, are often decimated by SARS-CoV-2 infection. \"We found ourselves needing a curated suite of nutritional product solutions that were targeted at the five main drivers of Long Covid: ACE2 mediated microbiome/dysbiosis.\" -Kristine Burke, MD For the first 30 days, in addition to the full array of Foundational supplements, patients should take: Arterosil, 2 caps twice daily; ITIS, 2 caps thrice daily; Tollovid 3 caps 4 times per day; and MegaSpore alone (the prebiotic is added later), 1 cap daily for the first 7 days, and then 2 caps daily until the bottle is finished. From Day 30 to Day 90, patients can cut the doses to: Arterosil 1 cap twice daily; and Tollovid 1 cap twice daily for 30 days. They should eliminate the MegaSpore probiotic, replacing it with the MegaPre oligosaccharide formula, 3 caps per day. All products in the protocols are available as a bundle from Fullscript. Practitioners with Fullscript accounts can prescribe the complete protocols for patients, and Fullscript will deliver the full product suite to their homes, along with detailed implementation instructions. Dr. Burke and members of the Working Group stress that the current protocols, though based on a scientific review of hundreds of potential candidate products, are still a work in progress. The team has established a standardized registry to track outcomes in hundreds of patients now on the protocols, and they will use the data to revise the protocols if necessary. She added that these regimens are flexible. \"There may be some patients for whom we want to add some other tools not on the protocol list. You may choose to add or subtract products. But this is the broadest and simplest set of products and processes that we could develop. We're not promoting specific brands necessarily. But the ones on the list, we found data to support the use of each of them to target one or more of the five key drivers of long Covid.\" Disclosure: ANDHealth and Calroy Health Sciences are clients of OvationLab. A metanalysis of 12 clinical studies representing a total of 776 patients diagnosed with dementia shows that phototherapy interventions can significantly improve cognitive function as indicated by changes in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Phototherapy did not, however, have measurable impact on depression, agitation, or sleep patterns. Researchers at the Institute of Geriatric Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, searched the global medical literature for studies of phototherapy in the context of dementia and found a total of 1,088 citations. Of these only 12 met the project's strict screening criteria, which followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Within these 12 studies, 426 patients had undergone some form of phototherapy, with a total of 340 similarly diagnosed patients serving as controls. In all studies, there were more females than males. The mean patient ages ranged from 73 to 86 years old. The trials represented a broad range of phototherapy protocols, frequencies, and durations. Two studies used blue or blue-green light, while the rest used broad-spectrum lights. Three studies tested multiple daily exposures, while 9 looked at once-daily treatments. Duration of treatment ranged from 6 minutes to 120 minutes per session. Overall, phototherapy improved MMSE scores by a mean difference of 2.68 points between treated patients and controls. There were no meaningful differences in Neuropsychiatric Inventory score, sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and Sleep Disorders Inventory score between the groups. The metanalysis was not designed to evaluate the relative efficacy of specific types of light, or to differentiate between the diverse protocols. Rather, it was intended to answer the broader question of whether phototherapy has any merit in the context of dementia. The answer to that question appears to be affirmative. \"Our meta-analysis indicates that phototherapy improved cognitive function in patients with dementia but had no significant effect on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSDs) and sleep. This suggests that phototherapy may be one of the most promising non-pharmacological interventions for improving core symptoms of dementia,\" write authors Xinlian Lu, Chengyu Liu, and Feng Shao. Their findings were published in the journal Brain and Behavior, in April. The metanalysis was not designed to evaluate the relative efficacy of specific types of light, or to differentiate between the diverse protocols and schedules used in the trials. Rather, it was intended to answer the broader question of whether phototherapy as a general treatment category has any merit in the context of dementia. The answer to that question appears to be affirmative. Liu and colleagues cited several other studies that also suggest cognitive improvement from phototherapy, including a 2021 non-randomized controlled pilot study utilizing 2500 lux bright light for 8 weeks, that showed significant improvement in the MMSE score among mild-to-severe dementia patients (Liu CR, et al. Front Psychol. 2021). They also draw attention to a landmark 2008 Dutch trial showing that regular and frequent light exposure reduced cognitive deficits in the elderly by 5% (Riemersma-van der Lek R, JAMA, 2008). There are a number of potential mechanisms through which light exposure could affect cognitive function, including: compensation for reduced sensory input associated with aging and dementia, and stimulation of specific regions of the suprachaismic nucleus in the hypothalamus, which regulates circadian rhythms and synchronization of brain functions. Given the age curves prevalent in most of the industrialized world, and the lack of effective pharmaceutical treatments, there's a clear and pressing need for safe, effective, low-cost treatments to curtail the devastating impact of dementia. Phototherapy, say Liu and colleagues, holds great promise. Clearly, this is a field ripe for further research. Two of the country's leading naturopathic medical schools are planning to merge and become a single institution, a move that surprised many in the field. In June, the presidents of National University of Naturopathic Medicine (NUNM) and Bastyr University jointly announced a non-binding letter of intent to come together under one banner some time in 2024. The two schools, headquartered in Portland, OR, and Kenmore, WA, respectively, are the oldest modern naturopathic colleges in the country. Founded in 1956, NUNM (then called National College of Naturopathic Medicine) represented a rebirth of naturopathic medicine in the US at that time. The school has a long legacy of training excellent clinicians, researchers, and thought leaders, some of whom went on in 1978 to found Bastyr University. That school was named for John Bastyr, a teacher and early advocate of modern naturopathy. Both institutions have grown considerably since their founding. Bastyr in particular has expanded quickly over the last 20 years, opening a second campus in San Diego in 2012. But despite the growth, the schools are still small by contemporary university standards. NUNM currently trains around 360 students, and Bastyr has around 750 between its two campuses. Strength in Numbers Leaders at both schools believe there's strength in numbers, especially in today's economic environment which is generally hostile to small institutions. In an online \"town hall\" meeting announcing the proposed merger, Melanie Henriksen, ND, NUNM's president, says that by joining forces Bastyr and NUNM will create a combined student body of well over 1,000-an important threshold. \"Higher education research shows that a lot of things improve when a school has more than 1,000 students,\" she said. The new institution, which has yet to be named, would have a combined faculty of 388 members teaching 35 distinct program tracks. It will offer a total of 18 naturopathic residencies, and its three teaching clinics will have a combined capacity to provide nearly 60,000 patient visits. The merger would also allow faculty clinicians and students to use a common electronic health record system, creating opportunities to easily share information across the three campuses and to pool data for research projects. Stiff Headwinds Devin Byrd, PhD, president of Bastyr, says small higher education institutions like his and like NUNM have faced stiff demographic and economic headwinds in recent years: an overall decrease in the younger population driven by a longstanding decline in the US birth rate; a stagnant economy especially for many prospective; a relentless push toward online education; surging overhead and operating costs; and an aging faculty. These challenges are not unique to naturopathic training programs; all institutions of higher learning face similar trends, to varying degrees. But they are especially problematic for a small profession like naturopathy, which remains on the margins of healthcare at large, and which has a limited base of financial and structural resources. By joining together, NUNM and Bastyr will be able to pool financial resources, eliminate curriculum redundancies, and provide a wider spectrum of learning opportunities to the combined student population. \"This merger improves access for students while offering more flexibility in how they learn, more interdisciplinary program options, and expands research and clinical practice opportunities,\" says Byrd. One major advantage of the merger is that it will permit faculty members to concentrate on their true areas of expertise. \"Both of us are small institutions. Many of our departments are departments of 1 or 2 teachers,\" said Henriksen. \"We ask our staff to be jacks-of-all-trades. By coming together, we can allow people to focus more on their strengths, while maintaining adequate staff across all three campuses.\" The administrators envision a broader range of elective courses available to all students, based on the wide expertise of the combined faculty members. Harmonizing the Curriculum Though the two schools share many core principles and common objectives, they are unique and distinct, each with its own culture and legacy. No one is under the illusion that a merger will be easy. Byrd and Henriksen both emphasized that administrators are soliciting input from everyone connected with the schools, including current students, alumni, and faculty members. \"We need to understand what's working, what's not, and where the opportunities rest. We want to bring forward all the ideas that people may have been sitting on for a long time but not speaking about,\" says Byrd. \"We are seeking guidance from all the programs, and we'll make those decisions based on that. We'll do that with everyone around the table.\" Currently, NUNM operates on a block-based curriculum, in which students progress through a sequence of in-depth organ system block courses, one at a time. Bastyr has a more conventional curriculum, with students taking multiple courses at the same time. This is a major difference that has made it difficult for students at one school to transfer to the other if they so desire. One of the main objectives of the merger\u2014and one of its biggest challenges\u2014is to harmonize the two approaches and create a unified curriculum. Another challenge is the differences in permitted scopes of practice in the three states where the schools are located. Washington, Oregon, and California all recognize naturopathic medicine, and have licensure for NDs, but they differ in their authorized scopes. Kristina Connor, ND, dean of naturopathic medicine at Bastyr, says \"We will prepare students to operate at the highest level that they can, so grads can be successful in any state that they go to. The combined curriculum will be keeping this in mind, so students can work within different states, different jurisdictions.\" Byrd and Henriksen both stressed that the plan is to maintain all three campuses and all current faculty positions. A formal timeline for the merger has not yet been set, though the leaders say the effort of gathering input from their respective faculty, students, and alumni communities is already underway. The process of creating a new name and identity for the new school will begin this Fall. A Win for Students & Faculty Paul Mittman, ND, EdD, the president and CEO of Sonoran University of Health Sciences (formerly Southwest College of Naturopathic Medicine (SCNM), sees the Bastyr-NUNM merger as a win for students, teachers, and for the profession at large. \"I know many of the faculty at both schools. You have these extraordinary faculty members, and they won't be place-bound anymore. It'll be a school with 3 campuses, and the programs will be able to draw on each others' faculties, which will enhance the quality of the educational experience.\" A graduate of the former National College of Naturopathic Medicine, Mittman took the helm of SCNM 22 years ago, and has steered the institution through many changes including its recent rebranding as Sonoran University. He told Holistic Primary Care that he well understands the economic and demographic forces that moved his peers at NUNM and Bastyr to consider a merger. \"Schools everywhere are looking to collaborate and create new economies of scale. The headwinds facing higher education are real. The inflationary costs, the escalating costs of information technology, they're outpacing all other expenses. Even before the recent surge of inflation, costs were escalating. Schools are seeking all sorts of ways to meet those challenges. A merger is one type of collaboration along a spectrum of options.\" Mittman acknowledged that he and his team are feeling many of the same pressures as other institutions, though he added that there are no plans at Sonoran to undertake a merger with any other schools. Online learning, which accelerated during the Covid pandemic, is changing the very nature of all medical education, not just in the naturopathic field. Mittman says that in many ways it is liberating. Schools can draw on a wider range of non-local teaching expertise, and a lot of basic didactic work can be pre-recorded for students to view at home. This frees up in-person interactive time with faculty for in-depth discussions, case reviews, and practical application of knowledge, rather than rote lectures. Strengthening the Core Joseph Pizzorno, ND, who trained at National College of Naturopathic Medicine in the 1970s, and who was the founding president of Bastyr University, says the news of the merger took him by surprise. In an interview, he said he is agnostic about it. \"All I care about is that the institutions and the professions will be stronger. And I believe that multiple strong schools will make the profession stronger.\" Like Dr. Mittman at Sonoran, Dr. Pizzorno has decades' worth of experience in medical school administration. While he, too, recognizes the broader demographic and economic shifts, he sees two additional factors that underly the unique challenges confronting NUNM and Bastyr. One is the fact that many of the core principles and practices of naturopathy have been incorporated into functional medicine and holistic/integrative medicine, and are now more widely available outside of naturopathic circles. The other is the gradual shift within the naturopathic field toward a \"green allopathy\" approach. He is concerned that the naturopathic profession has lost some of the distinctive features that made it unique and appealing to many young would-be healers. Across the entire naturopathic field, new student enrollment is down, and program administrators need to figure out why. Pizzorno holds that, merger or not, the administrators at NUNM and Bastyr need to look closely at recruitment and application patterns, and to pay attention to the aspirations of prospective students who inquire about naturopathic training. A merger will, no doubt, give the schools greater economic efficiencies and increased capability to meet the demands of a new tech-enabled learning experience. But Dr. Pizzorno emphasized that the profession as a whole needs to re-commit to the basic principles of naturopathy, and to increase efforts to raise public awareness of what makes naturopathy unique and valuable. If you want to help your patients extend their life expectancies, tell them to take a hike! People who walk at least 8,000 steps per day for two or more days each week have significantly lower all-cause cardiovascular mortality rates 10 years later. That's the conclusion of an in-depth analysis of accelerometer data from 3,101 ethnically diverse US adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) in 2005-2006 (Inoue K, et al. JAMA Network. 2023). A collaborative research team based at the UCLA Geffen School of Medicine, and the Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, divided the cohort into three groups based on how often they reached the 8,000 daily steps threshold (0, 1-2 times per week, and 3-7 times per week). They then screened the National Death Index through the year 2019 to determine which of the NHANES study subjects had died, and from what causes. The cohort ranged in age from 32 to 69 years (mean 50.5 years) at the time their walking patterns were tracked. The group was more or less evenly split between women and men, and included 21.5% Black and 23.7% Hispanic participants. The 4 Mile Threshold Of the total, 532 (17.2%) took 8,000 or more steps per day on 1-2 days per week; 1,937 people (62.3%) hit that threshold at least three times weekly. Eight thousand steps equals roughly 4 miles, based on an average stride length of 2.1 to 2.5 feet. During the 10-year follow-up period, there were 439 (14.2%) deaths from all causes and 148 (5.3%) deaths related to cardiovascular disease among the study participants. After adjusting for confounding variables such as age, ethnicity, marital status, smoking status, and pre-existing disease diagnoses, the researchers found that those who met the 8,000-step criterion on one to two days per week had a 14.9% reduction in all-cause mortality compared with the subset that never met the 8,000-step threshold during the tracking period. For those who walked 8,000 steps on 3 or more days per week, the mortality reduction was 16.5% relative to those who never met the that 8,000-step cutpoint. The mortality figures were based on calculation of adjusted risk differences (aRDs). The investigators note that one aim of the study was to determine if there is a dose-response pattern in the effects of walking on health and wellbeing. The numbers suggest that this is the case. A \"Dose-Response\" Pattern \"The dose-response association for both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality risk was curvilinear; the protective association plateaued at 3 days per week,\" they write, adding that \"different thresholds for the number of daily steps between 6,000 and 10,000 yielded similar results.\" This new study confirms the conclusion of a 2022 metanalysis of 15 international populations which showed that mortality declines steadily in relationship to increasing numbers of daily steps, up to 8,000 steps per day (Paluch AE, et al. Lancet Public Health. 2022) Number of daily steps is an easy proxy for overall physical activity. A worldwide study of smartphone accelerometer data gathered from more than 717,000 individuals, and representing 68 million aggregate days of activity, showed that Americans average just 4,800 steps per day (Althoff T, et al. Nature. 2017). That's far below the 8,000-step threshold that has consistently been associated with health benefits. In her critique of the new UCLA-Kyoto University study for DynaMed, Elham Razmpoosh, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at McMaster University, pointed out two major flaws that compromise the strength of its conclusions. First, is the fact that the patients who repeatedly hit the 8,000-step threshold tended to be younger and healthier than those who did not, which suggests that frequency of walking is a reflection of overall health as much as it is a causal factor. Second, the researchers quantified mortality differences in terms of adjusted risk differences which only indicate the absolute differences in risk between the frequent walkers and non-walkers. Razmpoosh argues that hazard ratios would have been a more appropriate statistic because these calculations account for time-to-event (in this case death) whereas aRDs do not. Walking = Health Bearing in mind these caveats, the Inoue study does underscore the connection between walking and health, and it indicates clearly that people need not engage in strenuous workouts in order to obtain the physiological benefits of physical activity. Inoue and colleagues point out that inactivity is a major public health problem, one that contributes to an estimated 3.2 million deaths and $54 billion in healthcare costs each year (Ding D, et al. Lancet. 2016) As most clinicians know all-too-well, it can be very difficult to get patients\u2014especially older people and those already plagued by metabolic dysregulation\u2014to exercise regularly. Walking is an easy, inexpensive, accessible and often enjoyable way to start becoming more active. \"For adults who face difficulties in exercising regularly, achieving the recommended daily steps only a couple days a week may have meaningful health benefits,\" Inoue and colleagues conclude.
