Identication is best done by phenotypic methods, although mass spectrometric methods have been de-scribed. Serology has a limited diagnostic role. Direct molecular and antigen detec-tion methods have limited availability and sensitivity. Clinical presentations of me-lioidosis range from acute bacteremic pneumonia to disseminated visceral abscessesand localized infections. Transmission is by direct inoculation, inhalation, or inges-tion. Risk factors for melioidosis include male sex, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse,and immunosuppression. The organism is well adapted to intracellular survival, withnumerous virulence mechanisms. Immunity likely requires innate and adaptive re-sponses. The principles of management of this condition are drainage and debride-ment of infected material and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Global mortalityrates vary between 9% and 70%. Research into vaccine development is ongoing. KEYWORDS Burkholderia pseudomallei , melioidosis INTRODUCTION The genus Burkholderia contains over formally named species ( 1). Only Burkhold- eria pseudomallei ,B. recog- nized as human pathogens organisms are aerobic, non-spore-forming, nonfermenting Gram-negative bacilli. All are environmental organisms, the host-adapted pathogen B. mallei ( 2). B. pseudomallei causes melioidosis in both humans and animals and is designated a tier 1 select agent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ( 3). It isasaprophyticenvironmentalorganismfoundpredominantlyintherhizophere,moistsoil, and both surface water and groundwater ( 4-6). This infection was rst recognized in Rangoon by Whitmore and Krishnaswami in 1911 ( 7). Infection with B. pseudomallei is most commonly associated with an inoculating injury, ingestion, or inhalation ofaerosolizedbacteriaandoccursmorefrequentlyinthewetseasonorfollowingextremeweather events such as tropical storms ( 8-11). Community-acquired pneumonia is the most frequent clinical presentation and bacteremia the most common microbiologicaldiagnosis ( 9,12).B. mallei is agent of glanders, a disease predominantly affecting solipeds and livestock but also occasionally humans ( 2,13,14). In contrast to B. pseudomallei ,B. malleiisahost-adaptedpathogenpredominantlyofsolipedsandhas little environmental persistence. The organism is considered eradicated from NorthAmerica, Australia, and most of Europe, with only one reported case in the UnitedStates since 1945 ( 2,14,15). Melioidosis is predominantly a disease of subtropical and tropical regions. It is endemic in northern Australia and parts of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent( 16). The incidence of melioidosis appears to be increasing, although mortality appears to be improving in Australia, with an average mortality rate of 14% overall in aprospective Australian study ( 8). Mortality rates from patients admitted to a hospital in northeast Thailand for melioidosis remained high over the period of 1997 until 2006,withanaverageannualrateof42.6%( 17).Furtherestimates,asof2018,indicateoverall melioidosis case fatality rates of 30 to 35% in admitted patients to public hospitals inThailand ( 18). EPIDEMIOLOGY B. pseudomallei appearstohaveoriginatedinAustralia,anddispersalintoSoutheast Asia is likely to have occurred during a recent glacial period across what is now theMalay Archipelago ( 19). Emerging evidence supports the anthropogenic dispersal hypothesis, which proposes that the distribution of the organism was influenced byhuman migration ( 20). Statistical analysis of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of isolates from individual islands in the Torres Strait demonstrates nonrandomlocaliza-tion of sequence types (STs). This information suggests specic localization of B. pseudomallei STs by biogeographical niches and not random dispersal ( 20). Melioidosis is endemic in approximately 46 countries and is potentially endemic in afurther33countriesyettoreportautochthonouscases( 21,22).Figure1demonstratesGassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 2areas of both known and predicted melioidosis endemicity based on environmental suitability, as well as the predicted change in prevalence of the major risk factor forinfection, diabetes mellitus, by 2030 ( 21,23). Although Thailand and Australia have the highest reported rates of melioidosis worldwide, the true worldwide incidence isunknown,asthemajorityofinfectionislikelytooccurinruraltropicallocationswithoutresources to adequately diagnose cases ( 9,18,24,25). Current estimates based upon a modelling study suggest that 165,000 cases of melioidosis result in 89,000 deathsworldwide per year ( 21). A recent publication entitled \"Global Burden and Challenges of Melioidosis\" encompasses a comprehensive series of region-specic articles onmelioidosis ( 26). Outside of human infection, melioidosis has been found to affect a varietyofanimalsfromlivestocktodomesticpets( 9).Thismayrepresentapotentialfor epizootics to result in human infection, but reports describing this are rare, withuncertainty over whether transmission occurred from a zoonotic origin ( 25,27). The Environment B. pseudomallei has been recognized as an environmental saprophyte for a long time, with ongoing investigations dening our understanding of the interactionsbetween the environment and both human and animal hosts ( 28). Early investigators believed that a rodent host served as a zoonotic reservoir ( 29). Subsequently, several observationsweremadeleadingtoourcurrentunderstandingof B. pseudomallei being widely distributed in the environment, with exposure to soil and surface water beingrisks for subsequent invasive disease ( 28). Several factors complicate the study of B. pseudomallei in the environment, including different techniques for environmental surveys. Early studies used animal inoculation techniques, which only detected virulentB. pseudomallei . Later studies used articial media, detecting both virulent B. pseu- domallei and potentially B. pseudomallei -like organisms ( 28). Sensitivities of various culture techniques for environmental isolation have been noted to vary widely ( 30). FIG 1Twenty-ve countries with the highest predicted melioidosis incidence and predicted increase in prevalence of the major risk factor, diabetes mell itus.Melioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 3Other challenges include consistency of sampling between studies, including depth of soil sampling, as well as a limited ability to accurately quantify B. pseudomallei in soil samples ( 28). B. pseudomallei was cultured from surface water samples in French Indochina in 1955 (31). Subsequently, multiple studies have demonstrated environmental exposure asariskfactorforinfection( 32,33).Themajorityofreportedcasesoccurinregionswith environmental factors favorable for survival of B. pseudomallei , most frequently be- tween the tropical latitudes 20\u00b0N and 20\u00b0S, although multiple cases have been foundoutside these parameters, including regions of Australia and Taiwan ( 9,21,34,35). Research regarding the reason for the current geographic distribution of B. pseudomal- leihas demonstrated that both the occurrence of clinical cases and the presence of the organism in the environment are related to factors such as ambient temperature, soilmoisture content, water drainage, soil type, pH, salinity, iron content, and geomorphicposition ( 36-41). The ideal temperature for organism survival ranges between 24 and 32\u00b0C, and a soil moisture content of /H1135040% results in organism survival within soil for longer than 2 years, compared with only 30 days in soil with 0% water content ( 38). Acrisolandluvisolsoils,whichconsistofaclay-richsubsoillayerandareassociatedwithtropical climates, appear to have a positive association with B. pseudomallei isolation, whereas ferralsols are negatively associated with organism isolation ( 42). In the context of flooding, the low water permeability of acrisol and luvisol results in altered physio-chemical conditions, including reduced pH, which may favor mobilization of iron andtherefore provide a survival advantage ( 37,42-46). However, the association between soil iron content and isolation of B. pseudomallei is conflicting, with evidence demon- strating both positive and negative associations ( 47-50). High saline content in soil appearstoinducevariousvirulencegenesandmaythereforedirectlycorrelatewiththeorganism's pathogenicity in these environments ( 39). In water samples, recovery of B. pseudomallei is correlated with turbidity, which is a marker of bacterial particulate attachment( 51).Theorganismcanbetransportedviawaterwaysandisincreasedinthe setting of eroded soil during periods of heavy rainfall ( 42,52). The annual incidence of infection is also affected by humidity, rainfall, and severe weather events such asmonsoons and tropical cyclones ( 4,12,53,54). Rainfall is thought to increase bacterial concentration in topsoil via the rise in the water table, and severe weather events andwind are associated with bacterially contaminated aerosols resulting in acquisition viainhalation ( 11,54-56). A study in Laos and Cambodia reported a specic association between high humidity and a 3-fold increased incidence in children compared withthat in adults ( 54). It remains unclear as to why this association exists, with current theories including increased environmental exposure via swimming in contaminatedwater, or a shorter incubation period and subsequent presentation in children com-pared to those in adults ( 54,57). The potential for environmental interaction with Acanthamoeba was rst described by Inglis et al., who postulated an association with B. pseudomallei survival ( 58). The presence of Acanthamoeba astronyxis enhanced survival of B. pseudomallei when subjected to disinfection by chlorine, monochloramine, and UV light ( 59). However, these results may be organism specic, as multiple taxa of free-living amoebae havedemonstrated the ability to internalize but subsequently digest B. pseudomallei bacilli. This suggests that free-living amoebae are unlikely to be a signicant environmentalreservoir ( 60). Oceania Melioidosis in Australia was described rst for sheep in 1949 and subsequently for humans in 1950 ( 61,62). Australian epidemiological studies have reported an average annual incidence of 19.6 cases per 100,000 population, ranging from 5.4 to 41.7 duringsevere weather events in the Northern Territory (NT) ( 9). An above-average rainfall year in the NT during 2009 to 2010 resulted in the highest annual documented incidencesintheworld,50.2casesper100,000populationand102.4intheindigenouspopulation( 63).TheannualincidencesintheTorresStraitIslands,CapeYork,andCairnshavebeenGassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 4reported to be 42.7, 12.1, and 1.7 cases per 100,000 population, respectively ( 12,64). In western Papua New Guinea, the annual incidence is approximately 20.0 per 100,000population, and 2.6% of environmental soil samples from other regions were positive( 65,66). This percentage of positive environmental samples is substantially lower than that found in northern Australia, where soil samples taken from around the roots of nativegrasseshave B. pseudomallei directmoleculardetectionratesusingreal-timePCR of 32% in the wet season and 20% in the dry season ( 6). Notably, exotic grasses had constant high prevalences, 71% in the wet and 62% in the dry season, and B. pseudomallei was also found to colonize the rhizosphere and aerial parts of some grasses, which may suggest a mechanism of dispersal by grazing animals via either theoral-fecal route or roaming ( 6). Furthermore, this environmental interaction may aid in further understanding the incidence in certain geographical settings. Additionally, B. pseudomallei infection has been associated with outbreaks related to contaminated watersupplies( 67).Fouroutbreakshavebeenreported,twoofwhichinvolvedanimals, namely, pigs and parrots, and two involving human cases which were associated withunchlorinated water in Western Australia and the Northern Territory ( 67-70). Southeast Asia In Thailand, the true incidence is difcult to assess due to lack of diagnostic resources, potentially high seroprevalence due to B. thailandensis , and incomplete epidemiological data ( 71). Melioidosis is a notiable condition by law in Thailand; however, current ofcial reports appear to substantially underreport melioidosis-associated deaths ( 18). A study performed in northeast Thailand between 1987 and 1991 suggested an incidence of 4.4 cases per 100,000 population per year ( 72). More recent observations demonstrate a peak incidence of 21.3 per 100,000 population in2006 and an average of 12.7 per year for the period from 1997 to 2006 ( 17). Further- more, a serological study from northeast Thailand suggested an increasing seropreva-lence with age, with more than 80% of the population over the age of 4 testingseropositive ( 73). This result may be due to a number of factors, including repeated exposure in early childhood and the use of the indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA)for diagnosis. The IHA for B. pseudomallei has been reported to have cross-reactivity to the less virulent and rarely pathogenic Burkholderia thailandensis ( 74,75). Notably, despite the fact IHA the rate of cross-reactivity wasdemonstratedtobeverylow( capsular polysaccharide, is unlikely to account for a signicant proportion of seropositive patients ( 75-77). Outside of the high- endemicity northeast region of Thailand, recent studies provide evidence of highincidence in east and south Thailand ( 78,79). A bacteremia study in the eastern province of Sa Kaeo reported an annual melioidosis incidence of 4.9 cases per 100,000population ( 78). Extrapolating these data to include all cases of melioidosis suggests that the annual incidence is likely to be 10 cases per 100,000 population ( 78). The prevalence of melioidosis among patients admitted during a 10-year retrospectivestudy in a southern Thailand hospital was 36.8 per 100,000 inpatients ( 79).B. pseu- domallei is likely endemic in every region of Thailand and is currently underreported (18). RecentVietnamesereportssuggestthatallgeographicalregionsofthecountryhave either positive environmental or clinical isolates ( 80-83). The seroprevalence in Hanoi from a 1993 study was 6.4 to 31.8%, and more recent environmental surveys indicatethat over 80% of soil samples in Southern Vietnam are positive for B. pseudomallei ( 84, 85).Arecentprospectivestudyin5centralVietnamhospitalsreporteda B. pseudomallei detection rate in blood cultures of 3.4 to 10.2% of all bacteremias during the 7-monthstudy period ( 83). The rst documented cases of melioidosis in Malaysia occurred in a 1913 outbreak among laboratory guinea pigs and rabbits, with the rst human cases recognized insubsequent years ( 29,86). Currently, Malaysia has the second highest reported inci- dence of melioidosis in the region. In the northeastern state of Kelantan, 158 provenMelioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 5cases were documented from 2001 to 2015 from a single tertiary center ( 87). Current reports suggest a range of 6.1 to 16.4 cases per 100,000 population per year ( 87,88). Malaysian pediatric melioidosis infections have been reported at 0.6 to 4.1 cases per100,000 children annually, with central Sarawak having the highest rate ( 89,90). Serosurveillance data on multiple population groups from 1969 reported a seropreva-lence of 1.9 to 15.8% ( 91). A 1992 survey of army personnel in Sabah and Sarawak reported a prevalence of up to 65.7% ( 92). Notably, these studies appear to have included predominantly men and used different serological assays ( 91,92). Melioidosis is thought to account for approximately 2,000 deaths annually in Malaysia, whichsurpasses the mortality rates of both dengue and tuberculosis infections ( 93). In Singapore, the rst case of melioidosis was reported in 1920, and it has been a notiableconditionsince1989( 94).Astudyfrom2003to2014demonstratedanoverall annual melioidosis incidence of 1.1 cases per 100,000 population, with incidencedecreasing by 10% annually during this time frame ( 95). Furthermore, studies of severe community-acquired pneumonia have demonstrated a decreased proportion of thetotalofmicrobiologicallyconrmedbacterialcausesfrom24%between1989and1993to 13% in 2003 to 2005 ( 96,97). One reason for this decrease is purported to be the improved infrastructure regarding water sanitation, rainwater drainage, and floodreduction ( 95). A seroprevalence of 0.2% in Singapore has been determined using an IHAwithapositivetiterdenedas /H113501:16(98).Whilethisstudydidnotappeartostratify forsexorcomorbidities,theoverallseroprevalenceinSingaporeandspecicallyamonglocal construction workers (1.6%) was signicantly lower than in samples from foreignconstruction workers (28.3%) from Thailand, Malaysia, and the Indian subcontinent asdetermined by the same method to ( 94). One theory regarding the reportedly lower seroprevalence in Singapore is that it may be due to a combination of Singapore'shighly urbanized environment and the comparatively lower rates of B. pseudomallei in soil and water samples, with the organism able to be recovered from 5.9% of surfacewater samples and 1.8% of 395 soil samples ( 94,99). However, it should be noted that these studies were performed prior to a published international consensus method forenvironmental sampling and recovery of B. pseudomallei ( 100). A notable difference in Singapore isolates is a lack of genetic diversity, with only 3 STs from 13 environmental samples, compared with 9 STs from a single sampling point in Thailand, 33 fromCambodia, 32 from Malaysia, and 13 from Laos ( 101-105). In Cambodia, microbiologically proven human melioidosis was rst diagnosed by local institutions in 2008 ( 106). Prior to this, a case report described a Cambodian refugee in Canada who presented with pulmonary melioidosis in 1983 ( 107). Notably, regular identication of B. pseudomallei in Cambodian hospitals commenced only following the establishment of a microbiology laboratory at Angkor Hospital forChildrenin2005,andwhilethelaboratorywasbecomingestablished,itispossiblethatcasesofmelioidosisweremisidentiedforsometime,priortothecorrectidenticationofB. pseudomallei ( 105,106,108). A prospective adult sepsis study of 139 patients in Takeo Province reported that 5% were culture positive for B. pseudomallei over a duration of 1 year ( 109). However, this is likely to be an underestimate of the true burden of melioidosis, as the study primarily included blood culture specimens onlyfrom adults with sepsis ( 109). A recent pediatric study estimated the annual incidence of melioidosis at 28 to 35 cases per 100,000 children per year ( 110). This may be an underestimate due to several limitations of the study, including collection of microbi-ologicalsamplesatthediscretionofattendingcliniciansfromonlyoneoftwopediatricreferralcentersinSiemReapandalimitedabilitytoaccountforchildrenwhomayhavedied prior to hospitalization ( 108,110). A seroprevalence survey of demon- strated a 16% seropositivity rate, and furthermore, 30% of soil samples from rice eldswere culture positive ( 111). In a comparison of the bacterial soil burdens, Cambodian samples had a median of 90 CFU/g of soil, whereas Thai samples had a reported countof230CFU/g( 111,112).Thismayaccounttosomeextentforthelowerseroprevalence, but the fact that only one geographical region in Cambodia was evaluated may haveGassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 6resulted in an inaccurate representation of the burden of B. pseudomallei in the environments of other regions. In Laos, 36% of environmental soil samples were positive for B. pseudomallei in a 1998 survey, with a mean quantitative value of 39 CFU/g of soil. More recent informa-tion from a nationwide survey of 23 rivers reports 9% culture-positive samples in thedry season and 57% positive in the wet season ( 52,113). Interestingly, there appears to be a clear north-south divide with regard to environmental isolation of B. pseudomallei , with the two most northern sample sites being negative using both conventionalculture and nucleic acid detection ( 52). Current theories for this contrast include differing climates, soil types, and land uses ( 42,52,114). Clinical cases of melioidosis were rst recognized in Laos in 1999 ( 115,116). The timing of the rst clinical case in Laos is likely directly related to the introduction of diagnostic services specically forthe identication of melioidosis in 1999 through the Lao-Oxford-Mahosot Hospital-Wellcome Trust Research Unit ( 117). Initial analysis revealed a prevalence of 3% in positivebloodcultures( 115).However,since2004,theyearlytotalofculture-conrmed cases has more than quadrupled, and hence overall prevalence is likely to be muchhigher ( 117). Melioidosis has been rarely reported from Indonesia. A recent review of Indonesian cases has summarized 146 culture-conrmed cases ever reported from thisregion. The authors acknowledge that limited diagnostic capability would be the mostlikely cause of this potential underreporting ( 118). China and Taiwan The People's Republic of China reported its rst case of melioidosis in 1990 ( 119). Subsequently, it was shown to be endemic in multiple tropical southern provinces,including Hainan, Guangdong, and Guangxi ( 119). As with many parts of the world, the number of reported cases has increased dramatically, with 170 conrmed cases re-ported between 2002 and 2013 in Hainan ( 120). In Taiwan, cases of melioidosis increased following a 2005 typhoon ( 121). This was further corroborated by seropreva- lence data revealing seropositivity as high as 36.6% in certain regions within the ErrenRiver Basin. Notably, this survey also demonstrated localization of environmental B. pseudomallei distribution, which surprisingly did not correlate with seroprevalence or case incidence ( 35). South Asia Bangladesh has only reported 14 cases of melioidosis from 1988 to 2016 ( 122). Serological survey results demonstrate a seroprevalence of 9.8% in regions with noreported clinical cases of melioidosis and a seroprevalence of 22.6 to 30.8% in regionswith proven cases. Additionally, as may be expected, there is an association betweenthe highest seroprevalence areas and number of cases ( 123,124). Environmental sampling isolated B. pseudomallei from only 1% of soil samples; however, the authors of this study recognize that their methods differed from the current internationalconsensus guidelines ( 124,125). To date, cases have been described only from north and east Bangladesh, and there is no formal notication policy ( 123). In Sri Lanka, the rst culture-conrmed case of melioidosis occurred in a European resident in 1927( 126). Cases of melioidosis in Sri Lanka have predominated in western provinces, with a notable exception of no cases being reported from areas higher than 500 m abovesea level ( 127,128). Seroprevalence results from 32 blood banks across Sri Lanka showed a 7.4% seropositivity using an IHA titer of /H113501:40, with a preponderance for the North Western Province ( 127). These results also revealed a substantially greater number of seropositive females (12.2%) than of seropositive males (6.2%), which isunexpected considering that over 70% of culture-conrmed cases were in males ( 127). In India, most states have reported conrmed cases of melioidosis ( 129). From 1991 to 2018,583caseswerereported,withthesoutherncoastalregionofKarnatakaandTamilNadu representing almost 80% of these cases ( 122,130,131). These regions may not truly reflect the areas of greatest incidence, as current diagnosis and reporting may beinfluenced by superior resources in these areas ( 129). Currently, the Udupi district inMelioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 7southwest India has the highest reported annual incidence, estimated to be 1.0 per 100,000 population, with a seroprevalence of approximately 29% using an IHA titer of/H113501:20 ( 129,132). Similar to the case with other regions, there has been an increase in case detection following improvement in laboratory diagnostic capabilities coupledwith local awareness campaigns for medical practitioners ( 129). At present, there is limited environmental data regarding the geographical distribution and prevalence ofB. pseudomallei infection in India ( 133,134). MLST data suggest that Indian isolates are distinctfrominternationalisolates,specicallyAustralasianandSoutheastAsianstrains.However, some appear closely related to Sri Lankan isolates, representing single-locusvariants as determined by BURST analysis ST phylogenetic software ( 129,135). While there is no comprehensive South Asia prevalence reporting to date, the continuing risein case reporting suggests that melioidosis is underreported ( 136). The Americas Five South American countries have reported cases of proven melioidosis: Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru ( 137). Currently, Brazil accounts for two-thirds of melioidosis cases in South America ( 138). Northeastern Brazil reported the rst provencasesofmelioidosisintwooutbreaksoccurringin2003and2004,withsporadic cases shortly thereafter ( 139,140). The estimated annual incidence in South America is 1,200 cases and 500 deaths ( 21). However, the true incidence is uncertain, as Cear\u00e1, a state in Brazil, is the only region with compulsory notication of cases, and fewlaboratories in this region can identify B. pseudomallei ( 137). There are potentially two cases of melioidosis without travel to a country of endemicity reported in the United States, but in both cases the organism's origin wasnot identied ( 141-143). To date there is no evidence of environmental B. pseudomallei in the United States ( 144). The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico is a melioidosis region of endemicity, with multiple cases of autochthonous infection ( 145-147). Limited popu- lation and environmental analyses demonstrated a seropositivity of 6 to 25% andisolation of B. pseudomallei from a soil sample ( 145). Furthermore, a study of Puerto Rican wildlife described a B. pseudomallei -seropositive terrestrial monkey ( 148). In Central America, cases have been reported from every country except for NicaraguaandBelize( 138).Althoughnoformalincidenceisavailable,predictedannualincidences are 550 cases in Mexico, 114 cases in El Salvador, and 24 cases in Haiti ( 21). Within the region of Latin America and the Caribbean, the population at risk is 246 million people,with an estimate of 2,000 cases of melioidosis and up to 1,000 deaths annually ( 21,149). This discrepancy in incidence compared to that in the rest of the world may be acombination of predictive variables, including environment, climate, and patient risk fac-tors, as well as worldwide underreporting ( 21,137). Genetic analysis has demonstrated a diversity of molecular types suggesting potential endemicity ( 139). In Brazil, theories regarding the organism's origin include importation through Caribbean livestock or otheragricultural products such as rice ( 139). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis had provided evidence of anthropogenic B. pseudomallei introduction into South and Central America between 1650 and 1850 CE. Interestingly, the authors of this study implicate theslave trade via transatlantic routes as a potential source ( 150). Africa B. pseudomallei has been isolated from environmental, animal, and human samples from multiple locations in Africa ( 151). Current modelling predicts approximately 24,000caseswith15,000deathsannuallyinsub-SaharanAfrica( 21).Thereareonlycase reports of proven infection acquired in Africa. However, these demonstrate that infec-tion appears to occur in multiple geographical locations across the continent ( 151- 153). There is only one documented case from North Africa, occurring in a horse from Egypt (154). Additionally, in 2013 a prospective analysis of bloodstream infections in Gabon detected the rst case of B. pseudomallei (155). Although Nigeria is speculated to have the greatest environmental suitability and hence burden of infection, only 1casehasbeenreportedtodate( 156).FourIndianOceanislands,Madagascar,Mauritius,Gassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 8Reunion Island, and Seychelles, have had conrmed human cases since 2004 ( 157). Genetic analysis of three African isolates revealed both genetic diversity and anancestral relationship to an Asian clade, furthermore supporting the evidence of bothanthropogenic dissemination and endemicity in Africa ( 158). The African Melioidosis Network (AMENET) was established in 2014, with the aim of serological and environ-mentalsurveillanceaswellasdiagnosticlaboratorydevelopmentforidenticationof B. pseudomallei ( 159). With increased awareness and active surveillance on the continent with a more robust data set, more accurate prevalence predictions may be feasible inthe coming years. BACTERIOLOGY AND LABORATORY IDENTIFICATION Originally termed Whitmore's bacillus or Bacillus pseudomallei , the genus Burkholderia (13,160,161).B. pseudomallei is an environmental opportunistic saprophyte capable of utilizing at least 80 different compounds tested asa nutritional carbon source ( 162). It is thus able to persist in a nutritionally depleted environment for substantial periods, with a reported 16 years in distilled water ( 163). Specimen Collection The culture of B. pseudomallei from any specimen in a patient with suspected melioidosis remains the diagnostic \"gold standard.\" Specimens include blood, respira-tory secretions, urine, and, when available, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pus, and swabs from wounds or lesions. B. pseudomallei grows well on most routine laboratory media. Improved isolation of the organism from nonsterile sites can be achieved by the use ofselective media such as Ashdown's media and selective enrichment broth ( 164). Bacteremia has been found to occur in 38 to 73% of cases ( 87,88,122,130,131, 165-168). In one study isolating pseudomallei from blood using the BacT/Alert (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) automated blood culture system, 62.5% of isolateswere detected in 24 h and 93% were detected within 48 h of incubation. The time forthe system to signal positive (mean /H11006standard error) was 23.9 /H1100614.9 h ( 169). When comparing the BacT/Alert system with conventional culture, which utilized in-housebrain heart infusion media and visual detection, the automated system was found tohave a sensitivity of 73.5%, compared to 90.3% for conventional culture ( 170). The major benet of the automated system was a shorter time to positivity, approximately1 day ( 170). Additionally, a study evaluating the sensitivity of the BacT/Alert FA aerobic bottle and BacT/Alert MB bottle with those of Middlebrook 7H9 broth, glycerol, andsodium polyanethol sulfonate demonstrated improved organism recovery with the MBbottle for patients with prior antimicrobial exposure ( 171). The Bactec (Becton Dickin- son,Sparks,MD)automatedbloodculturesystemhasalsobeenusedinlaboratoriesforthe isolation of B. pseudomallei from blood and sterile fluid. There are, however, limited data regarding the comparative sensitivity and time to positivity ( 172,173). The urine culture of patients with melioidosis is estimated to be positive for 28% of cases inThailand ( 174). Centrifugation of the sample and culture of the pellet improve sensi- tivity. Additionally, a quantitative urine culture revealed a comparatively higher mor-tality rate with increasing counts, with in-hospital mortality of 39% in culture-negativepatients, 58% with a quantication up to 71% with a quantica- tionof/H11022105CFU/ml(174).Throatswabsareaneffectivemethodoforganismrecovery, and routine screening of suspected melioidosis patients is performed in certain centers( 175,176). Culture B. pseudomallei organisms are small Gram-negative bacilli with bipolar staining giving them a safety pin appearance ( Fig. 2)(2). This feature, which is not specic to B. pseudomallei , is due to central accumulation of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) granules, which do not retain the staining reagents ( 40). The Gram stain appearance alone is notMelioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 9sufcient to make a presumptive diagnosis. The organism grows well on MacConkey, blood, and chocolate agars. Improved isolation of B. pseudomallei from sites with normal flora can be achieved using the selective Ashdown's medium which containsTrypticase soy agar with 4% glycerol, 50 mg/liter of neutral red indicator, 5 mg/liter ofcrystal violet, and 4 mg/liter of gentamicin as selective agents ( 2,164,177,178). Additionally, the use of a selective enrichment broth for throat, wound, and rectalswabs is likely to increase organism isolation ( 164). Although Ashdown's agar is an effectiveselectiveagar,itmayinhibitpersistentlymucoidstrainsandtheglycerolintheagar may inhibit smooth strains ( 179,180). In addition, rare gentamicin-susceptible strains from Sarawak have been described ( 181). Due to these limitations, new media have been developed. Burkholderia pseudomallei selective agar (BPSA), which includes maltoseasacarbonsource,excludescrystalviolet,utilizesNileblueasanindicator,andhas a of glycerol than Ashdown's agar, produced large wrinkledcolonies faster, allowing for earlier differentiation ( 180). Furthermore, Francis medium was developed to improve both detection and differentiation between B. pseudomallei and B. cepacia .I no n e in vitrostudy, Francis medium had a sensitivity of 78.4% and a specicity of 92.2% ( 182). Due to the advent of multiple medium options, a trial was performed on clinical isolates, including urine, respiratory samples, pus, and throat andwound swabs, to assess comparative performances ( 183). This study found no differ- ence in organism isolation but found BPSA to be signicantly less selective ( 183). ( 184). This agar demonstrated increased specicity compared to that of Ashdown's agar in a mouse model of gastrointestinal samples.With human clinical isolates this medium had improved selectivity but equal recoveryofB. pseudomallei ( 184). As there have been limited comparative evaluations of selective media, Ashdown's medium remains the standard selective medium in regionswhere melioidosis is endemic. Even in regions of low prevalence, the use of selectivemedia has demonstrated cost-effectiveness ( 185). A study evaluating the utility of throat swabs in the diagnosis of melioidosis including 4,535 patients (1,011 proven melioidosis patients and 3,524 dem-onstrated sensitivity 36% and specicity of 100% using Ashdown's medium ( 186). Additional analysis of selective and nonselective enrichment broth demonstrated FIG 2Gram stain demonstrating \"safety pin\" appearance. Magnication, /H11003100.Gassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 10improved sensitivity, 24.2%, with modied (50,000 U/liter, equivalent to 50 mg/liter) and crystal violet, 10% with tryptic soybroth ( 175,187). Modied Ashdown's broth is therefore considered the standard for B. pseudomallei isolation from throat swabs ( 175). Overall, the sensitivity of culture in the setting of melioidosis has been reported at 60.2%. Therefore, culture can be said tohave low sensitivity and low negative predictive value (NPV) ( 188). Additionally, there is a lack of quantitative organism correlation between blood and other specimen typessuch as urine, sputum, or pus. This suggests, for example, that organism isolation inurine is consistent with renal parenchymal infection and not passive ltration into theurine ( 189). Presumptive Bench Identication Colony morphology in the rst 24 to 48 h of growth on blood agar reveals smooth, creamy colonies ( 2,190). On Ashdown's agar, the colonies are pinpoint, flat, dry, and purpleandmaybewrinkled( Fig.3)(2,177).Phenotypicdifferentiationof B. pseudomal- leiincludes the ability to oxidase activity, and nitrate reduction (2).Additionally,theorganismisindolenegative,methylrednegative,Voges-Proskauer negative, and H2S negative. The characteristic triple sugar iron reaction is acid/alkaline with gas production ( 191).B. pseudomallei is a phenotypically heterogeneous organism with various morphologies, particularly after prolonged incubation ( 192). Despite this, experiencedlaboratorypersonnelcanoftenreadilyidentifycoloniesthatmayrepresentB. pseudomallei in areas of endemicity. Simple bench testing using the Gram stain, a metallic sheen on blood agar, oxidase positivity, and a resistance pattern demonstrat-ing gentamicin and amoxicillin-clavulanate sensitivity can pre-sumptively identify B. pseudomallei ( 80,193). It should be noted that, while a rare occurrence worldwide, gentamicin-susceptible B. pseudomallei accounts for 86% of isolates located in Sarawak, Malaysia ( 181). Rapid Antigen Detection Many latex agglutination assays have been developed for the rapid identication of B. pseudomallei . Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies exopolysaccharide have been trialed ( 173,194-198). Similar to the case with biochemical proles, the sensitivity and specicity of agglutinationassays differ between regions. One assay studied in an Australian laboratory and FIG 3Colonial morphology of B. pseudomallei . Shown are B. pseudomallei cultures on ASH (left) and HBA (right) at 24 h (top) and 48 h (bottom).Melioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 11performed on bacterial colony suspensions showed a sensitivity of 94%, a specicity of 83%, and false-positive cross-reaction with multiple species, including B. thailandensis (197). Monoclonal antibodies recognizing exopolysaccharide have a re- ported sensitivity of 98.7% for B. pseudomallei and a specicity of 97.2% on direct colony testing ( 199). A prospective study of direct detection from positive blood cultures using a monoclonal antibody 4B11 immunofluorescence assay (IFA) targetingthe exopolysaccharide a specicity of 100% ( 173). This assay was subsequently prospectively evaluated at another facility using 545positive blood cultures identied as containing Gram-negative bacilli. The resultsindicated a sensitivity of 100%, a 99.6%, and a negative predictive valueof 100% ( 200). Unfortunately, with nonblood clinical samples the same IFA showed sensitivities ranging from 32.7% on respiratory samples to 50% on pus ( 201). Identi- cation of B. pseudomallei directly from blood culture samples is feasible with latex agglutination assays. Two different monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated a sen-sitivity of 100% and a specicity of 85 to 100% ( 195,196). With this diagnostic method, organism identication may occur up to 2 days earlier than by using traditionalphenotypic and biochemical methods ( 196). This latex agglutination assay is currently not commercially available and is best utilized on culture amplied blood cultures thathave signalled positive. This would unfortunately negate the advantage of early,preamplication detection. The Active Melioidosis Detect (AMD; InBios International, USA) flow assay capsular polysaccharide (CPS) via a monoclonal anti- body was recently developed. An initial laboratory study using cultured organismdemonstrated a sensitivity of 98.7% and a specicity of 97.2% ( 202). Notably, a false-negative result occurred for an isolate with a frameshift mutation in the wcbR gene, which is known to decrease production of CPS ( 203). The low limit of detection (approximately 2 ng/ml) was felt to be a notable feature of the assay ( 202-204). An additional study using stored whole unamplied blood from culture-positive patientsreported a sensitivity of 40% ( 205). Subsequently, a prospective clinical trial was undertaken and demonstrated 99% sensitivity and 100% specicity on culture ampli-ed turbid blood culture bottles and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 94% on urinesamples ( 206). The LFA was easy to perform, provided a result in 15 min, and cost approximately $2 (U.S. dollars) per test ( 206). Withcontinuedimprovementinsensitivityandspecicityofrapidantigendetection testing, coupled with ease of use and low cost per test, it is conceivable that directantigen detection from clinical isolates will become a mainstay for diagnosis inresource-limited regions where melioidosis is endemic. Serology The serodiagnosis of melioidosis is difcult, with a lack of international standard- ization and high seropositivity rates in healthy individuals from regions of endemicity( 207,208). Additionally, a number of different antigens have been evaluated, with a wide range of reported sensitivities and specicities among multiple assays ( 207,209, 210).Itcanalsobechallengingtodetermineifaseropositivepatienthasacute,chronic, or past infection exposure without infection. The serum indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) has previously been considered the clinical standard serological test for melioidosis, although 19% and 26% of culture-conrmedcasesneverseroconvertedintwostudies( antigens B. pseudomallei adsorbed to sheep red bloodcells( 2).InpreviousThaistudies,anIHAcutofftiteroflessthan1:80wasdeemed unlikely to indicate a true positive, as 21% of healthy blood donors were found to haveatiterof /H113501:40,titersof1:80to1:320weresuggestiveofinfection,andatiterof /H110221:320 was very likely to indicate infection with a specicity of 97% ( 213,214). A recent repeat study of blood donors in northeast Thailand reported 38% seropositivity with titers of/H113501:80, further demonstrating the limitation of this test in regions of endemicity ( 215). In Australia, the cutoff used for positive results is 1:40, which was determined due to aGassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 12lower seroprevalence, ranging from approximately 2.5 to 8.7%, to 35 to 38% in Thailand 99% ( 218). This study also demonstrated a greater sensitivity than that of the IHA (74%) and a similar sensitivity to that of the IgG IFA (91%) in theacute phase ( 218). A rapid immunochromatography test (ICT) strip assay for both B. pseudomallei IgMandIgGwasevaluatedin1999anddemonstratedsensitivitiesof93% and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity for both assays was 95% ( 219). A similar assay fromthesamemanufacturerwassubsequentlycreatedintheformofacassettekit.Thisassay demonstrated lower IgM and IgG sensitivities, reported as 88% and 77%, respec-tively. The specicity for IgM was 69%, and that for IgG was 90%. The calculated PPVsof this cassette assay in the Northern Territory, Australia, were 18% for IgM and 32% forIgG,althoughanotherstudyperformedinnorthernQueensland,Australia,hadaPPVof90.5% ( 220,221). Due to these conflicting results, an additional study was performed, and it reiterated the low sensitivities for for IgG (50.6%) and for IgM (72%) ( 220). This test is no longer commercially available. Because of the ease of use, the utility of thistype of cassette kit would be high in low-resource regions where melioidosis isendemic, despite relatively low sensitivity ( 222). Novel antigen targets to improve diagnostic performance have been described and assessed. Recently, hemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp1) was determined to be avirulence factor associated with the type VI secretion system, highly expressed in theinfected host and therefore a potential diagnostic target ( 223-225). Additionally, O polysaccharide (OPS) has also been considered a potential serodiagnostic target, as theantigen is specic for B. pseudomallei and conserved across strains ( 209). However, an ELISA comparison between these two antigens demonstrated a signicantly greaterdiagnostic sensitivity for Hcp1 ( 226). Furthermore, a retrospective serum analysis from a melioidosis-infected Malaysian cohort using a recombinant Hcp1 ELISA reported asensitivityof93.7%andaspecicityof100%( 225).Subsequently,thisantigenwasused as a target in an ICT, which demonstrated a sensitivity of 88.3% and a specicities of86.1% in Thai samples and 100% in healthy donors from the United States ( 226,227). Interestingly, this study reported no signicant difference in sensitivity between bac-teremic and nonbacteremic patients ( 226). While this result is in contrast to an older immunoafnity-puried IgG ELISA demonstrating a higher sensitivity than those ofboth IgM ELISA and IHA for bacteremic patients, both assays appear to have a greaterabilitytoidentifyacuteinfectionthanthatoftheIHA( 226,228).NotonlyareHcp1titers signicantly elevated in early infection, but also these may be used to monitor diseaseprogress, with an expected decrease over time ( 226). Two more novel antigen candi- dates, including heat shock protein (a chaperone in GroEL protein), and outer mem-brane protein A (OmpA), have been evaluated. Recombinant GroEL protein had asensitivity of 92.1%, a specicity of 88.3%, and a less cross-reactive antibody responsein healthy individuals than did OmpA and may be a potential serodiagnostic antigen inregions of endemicity ( 210). Another potential method of improving serology diagnos- tic performance is combining available assays. The combination of IHA and IgM ELISAin the diagnosis of acute melioidosis in an area of endemicity demonstrated a sensi-tivity ( 229).Table the methods described in this section. The serodiagnosis of melioidosis remains a challenge but still has a role to play in the diagnosis of chronic melioidosis and where culture may not always be possible,such as in neuromelioidosis or with deep-seated abscesses. Perseverance in researchand development may yield a fast, easy-to-use, and cost-efcient method specicallybenecial to resource-limited settings. Identication by and Automated Phenotypic Methods Further verication of the identication of an isolate presumptively identied as B. pseudomallei is recommended ( 177,192).Melioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 13Identication of B. pseudomallei has been an ongoing challenge since its initial discovery. The API 20NE (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) has probably had thewidest use and in some settings of endemicity performs very reliably, correctly iden-tifying up to 98% of isolates ( 192). Other studies have not found it so consistent ( 193). Chromobacterium violaceum was the most common misidentication, which was thought to relate to errant interpretation of the biochemical tests with an opacityendpoint ( 230). However, it is notable that all isolates identied as C. violaceum had identicalrepetitiveextragenicpalindromicsequencespatterns,suggestiveofapossiblelocal strain ( 230,231). Following these discrepant results, the largest identication study was performed on 800 isolates from environmental, animal, and human samplescollectedfrom8countries.ThisstudyreportedthesensitivityoftheAPI20NEtobe99%(95% condence interval [CI], 98.0 such 2 (bioM\u00e9rieux), has an improved capacity for correctorganism identication; however, it, too, has a wide margin of error, with only 63 to81% of isolates accurately identied ( 233,234). Using this method, the most common misidentications a variety of nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, includingAcinetobacter species, followed complex ( 231,235). Performance of the Vitek 2 system appears to be geographically variable. Comparisonbetween Malaysian and Australian isolates revealed a greater number of B. pseudomal- leiisolates misidentied as B. cepacia in the Malaysian samples ( 236). These misiden- tied isolates appeared to cluster with biochemical proles distinct from that of thecorrectly identied was found in 88% ofcorrectlyidentiedisolates,comparedtoonly13%inthemisidentiedisolates( 236). With phenotypically similar species, a notable difference between the potentiallyavirulent B. thailandensis and B. pseudomallei is the ( The BD (Becton identication system does nothave B. pseudomallei inthedatabaseandconsequentlywillmostcommonlymisidentify the organism cepacia with 95 to 99% condence ( 238,239). Although not used in the laboratory diagnosis of melioidosis, gas chromatography has also demonstrated areliable ability to differentiate these species via analysis of fatty acid derivatives,including 2-hydroxymyristic acid ( 240). Identication by Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF A novel diagnostic method is matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Compared with other techniques, theadvantages include reduced analysis time, high sensitivity and specicity, minimaltechnical requirements, and relatively simple staff training for implementation 244).TwocommerciallyavailableMALDI-TOFMSinstruments,BrukerMicroflexBiotyper both certied for identication of clinical isolates. Currently,neither instrument's routine diagnostic database includes the reference spectra re-quired for identication of B. pseudomallei ( 245,246). The current Vitek MS in vitro diagnostic (IVD) database is able to accurately match the acquired organism massspectrum to the genus but not species level ( 247). The Vitek MS Research Use OnlyTABLE 1 Serological diagnosis of melioidosis Serologic test % suspension IgG ELISA 90 ( 218)9 9 ( Australia 220)-93 9 210) 88.3 ( 210) Thailand Combination IHA and IgM ELISA 100 ( 229) 95.4 ( 229) Thailand aCutoff values of /H113501:40 to /H113501:320 were used in studies, with results depending on cutoff value used.Gassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 14(RUO) database does include B. pseudomallei spectra, but it is not yet FDA approved, nor has it been assessed in a clinical context ( 248). Using the conventional Bruker database the organism identication may be valid only to the genus level and identifythe isolate as B. thailandensis ( 248). In this scenario, the security-relevant library, which includes potential agents of bioterrorism, can identify B. pseudomallei (248-250). It appears that there are ve conserved biomarkers which are species specic for B. pseudomallei (251). for a ( m/z)o B. mallei,B. pseudomallei , and B. thailandensis ,m/z9,713 is required. The mass peak at m/z6,551 differentiates B. thailandensis from the rst two species. The peak mass intensity of m/z5,794 and 7,553 can be used to differentiate B. pseudomallei from B. mallei, respectively ( 245,251). The addition of phage-based diagnostics to MALDI-TOF MS, specically /H9272X216 (which is found in both B. pseudomallei and B. mallei) and addition of testing for /H92721026b (which isB. malleispecic), can aid in rapid identication and indirect susceptibility testing for ceftazidime resistance ( 252). Using the Bruker MS, in-house reference libraries have beenconstructedanddeterminedtobeaccurateintheidenticationof B. pseudomallei both from primary isolates and directly from positive blood culture broth ( 253,254). Similarly, a study using the Vitek MS RUO to create an in-house B. pseudomallei spectrum reported 100% organism identication from culture with a specicity of99.8% ( Fig. 4)(244). These studies demonstrate a viable laboratory alternative that would decrease time to identication by up to 24 h. A potential obstacle to the routine use of MALDI-TOF MS is the requirement for organism inactivation due to the potential risk of laboratory exposure ( 248). Various inactivation techniques have been trialed, including 70% ethanol, formic acid, trifluo-roacetic acid, gamma irradiation, centrifugation, and ltration, with various success( 255,256). With regard to formic acid, one study demonstrated 100% reduction in viable organism when on-plate 70% formic acid was applied ( 257). The currently uses 25% formic acid, compared to 70% in the Bruker method. Furtherexperimental results for comparison of 70% formic acid with a tube extraction methodconsisting of ethanol-formic acid-acetonitrile and centrifugal ltration demonstratedsuperior inactivation ( 255). An additional barrier to the use of mass spectrometry for organism identication is that melioidosis is predominantly endemic in resource-limited settings and is therefore unlikely to be a practical alternative ( 21). Molecular Conrmation and Direct Molecular Detection PCR testing of B. pseudomallei clinical isolates is an option for conrmatory identi- cation. However, due to the genetic variability, recombination, and lack of validationacross large data sets, its use has been limited ( 258,259). More recent research has increased current knowledge regarding specic genetic targets. At present, there areseveralreal-timePCRassaysavailableforspecies-specicidenticationof B. pseudomal- lei( 259-262). The type III secretion system gene cluster, specically cluster 1 (T3SS-1), orf2, and orf11, appear to be useful in discriminating B. pseudomallei from other Burkholderia rigorously tested on known environmental andclinical isolates and appears to have 100% specicity ( 259). Given the nature of the infection and high mortality, rapid diagnosis is imperative, and to that end, directidentication of the organism from clinical specimens would aid in early directedtherapy ( 8,12). The T3SS-1 real-time and specicity on urine, sputum, wound swabs, and drained pus ( 265). However, overall sensitivity and specicity on all clinical isolates were 73.2% and 89.2%, respectively.Performance of the assay on blood samples was less impressive, with 74% of septicbacteremic patients positive by PCR and only 17% patients PCR positive in thenonseptic bacteremic cohort ( 265,266). Notably, the sensitivity of the assay in septic patients is in keeping with previous evidence that sepsis in melioidosis is associatedwith a higher blood bacterial burden ( 267). Differentiating burden of bacteremia by number of CFU and /H1102250 CFU/ml) is associatedMelioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 15with prognosis, with one study demonstrating 50% in-hospital mortality with 1 to 50 CFU/ml, compared to 79% with /H1102250 CFU/ml ( 268,269). A study by Wuthiekanun et al. suggests the median concentration of bacteria in blood to be 1.1 CFU/ml ( 270). Therefore, the limit of detection (LOD) of the aforementioned T3SS-1 assay may play arole in its altered sensitivity in blood compared to other clinical samples ( 265). Further research on spiked blood using a more targeted T3SS-1 orf2region primer demon- strated a 95% probability of detection at an organism concentration of 8.4 /H11003103 CFU/ml (263). However, this probability decreased to just 12.5% for a concentration of 500CFU/ml.Theauthorsofthisresearchsuggestthatbyincreasingthesamplevolumeused 5-fold, which extrapolates a result of approximately 500 CFU/ml, and performingthe assay in triplicate, the probability of detection would be approximately 100% ( 263). This may not be a feasible testing methodology, and a recently described single-tubemultiplex PCR may be the alternative. Using the flagellar structural protein gene fliCto FIG 4Comparison of B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis spectra using the Vitek MS.Gassiep et al.

Previous PCR assays as described above are based on phylogenetic or virulence genes. Alternative identica-tion using species-specic /H9252-lactamase genes in a multiplex assay has shown promise, although notably not on clinical isolates ( 271). Althoughthereremainconcernsregardingspeciesdetectionanddifferentiationdue topotentialgeneticmutationsordeletion,thishasbeenrare,andthemostconcerningreportsoffalse-negativeresultsareassociatedwithnonsepticbacteremicpatients( 262, 265).Giventhecurrentbodyofresearch,thereareseveralpotentialgeneticmarkersfor genusandspeciesidentication( multiplex approach may be better ( 262). Several of the mentioned targets in combination have excellent specicity, but the limit of detection in blood asa specimen is a signicant limitation ( 263,265). Newer molecular markers are available including bucl16, for which an assay was able to detect 50 CFU/ml in a mouse model (273). The method of DNA extraction from clinical isolates may well be the key to improved LOD. Comparison of 7 DNA extraction kits revealed an LOD of 5.5 /H11003103 CFU/ml. The High Pure kit revealed the best sensitivity and technically the lowest LOD, with 1 positive result from 9 at 4.9 /H11003102CFU/ml and a cycle threshold of 37.3 ( 274). With regard to blood, plasma appears to have a higher rate of nucleic acid recoverythan other blood fractions ( 275). Furthermore, centrifugation of whole blood and then DNA extraction may increase diagnostic yield ( 276). In a true clinical scenario blood cultures would likely be performed, and detection of an organism directly from bloodculture broth (timing of aspiration and analysis to be determined) may furthermoreimprove detection ( 277). Improved detection of genetic material from clinical urine samples may also be feasible. A lter-capture DNA isolation method has demonstratedthe ability to detect 10 2CFU/ml from 0.45 ml of synthetic urine. This method appears to be faster and more sensitive than the QIAamp protocol comparator ( 278). While there are multiple methods for the molecular detection of B. pseudomallei , currently none are used in routine diagnostics. With the highest mortality rates occur-ring in septic and bacteremic patients, the ideal platform for molecular detection mustproduce a result within hours and require minimal handling. Automation, cost-effectiveness,andareproduciblelimitofdetectionof1CFU/mldirectlyfrombloodwillbe essential to achieve this ( 270). Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing and Antimicrobial Resistance Ceftazidime and meropenem are the preferred antibiotics for the initial parenteral phase of treatment, while co-trimoxazole (TMP-SMX), doxycycline, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid are used for eradication therapy and postexposureprophylaxis( 279).Nointernationalinterpretiveguidelinesexistfordiskdiffusiontesting ofB. pseudomallei . Currently, the only available guidelines are those of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) ( 280). This is by a broth dilution method and is calibrated for imipenem, ceftazidime, TMP-SMX, tetracycline, and amoxicillin-clavulanicacid. While there is limited evidence for disk diffusion methodology and interpretationcurrently, it is convenient, easy to perform, and maybe an alternative in cases wherelaboratories are unequipped to perform CLSI-recommended methods ( 281,282). Cau- tion needs to be exercised in interpreting zone diameters for TMP-SMX, as an indistinctendpoint can lead to the incorrect reporting of resistance ( Fig. 5)(282). UnlikeotherGram-negativebacteria, B. 191,283-285). There are multiple factors associated with intrinsic resistance, including antimicrobial cell entry, expulsion, and enzymatic degradation ( 286-288). In B. pseudomallei , efflux pumps of the resistance nodulation cell division (RND) family are the most clinically relevant ( 286).B. pseudomallei genomes encode up to 10 RND efflux pumps, 7 on chromosome 1 and 3 on chromosome 2. Currently, only 3 RND effluxMelioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 17pumps have been characterized, namely, AmrAB-OprA, BpeAB-OprB, and omeprazole and have synergistic antimi- crobial effects against efflux pumps, reducing the MIC of erythromycin and providinga protective benet to lung epithelium and macrophages via mitigated cytotoxicity( 289). Another intrinsic mechanism of resistance is that of reduced outer membrane permeability to antimicrobial agents ( 288). Polymyxin is poorly bound, and the self- promoted uptake pathway (in which a cationic antimicrobial displaces lipopolysaccha-ride cations and aids in uptake) is blocked ( 288). Polymyxin resistance specically is multifactorial and includes the isoprenoid synthesis enzymeIspH,metalloproteasesZmpAandZmpB,periplasmicproteinMucD,effluxpumpNorM,and many others ( 290). Resistance to rst-line antimicrobial therapy is uncommon ( 284,291-293). In the majority of primary /H9252-lactam-resistant isolates, the etiology is a class A /H9252-lactamase encoded by the gene penA, located on chromosome 2 ( 287,294). Multiple reported penAmutations are associated with Amino increased resistance ( 294,296). Further /H9252-lactam resistance has been associated with potential selective pressure and genetic rearrangement of chromosome 2 with resultant alteration of penicillin-binding protein3 (PBP3) in a clinical isolate. This isolate furthermore did not grow on standard mediaand required Ashdown's agar supplemented with 4% glycerol ( 297). Such isolates might easily be missed using standard laboratory methods. It is important to note that a study of over 4,000 isolates in Thailand and over 600 isolates in Singapore reported ceftazidime resistance at 0.5%, while multiple smallerstudies demonstrated 100% susceptibility ( 284,291,293,298-300). Detailed molecular analysis has demonstrated the appearance of novel single nucleotide polymorphismsselected during ceftazidime therapy. Additionally, these novel mutations appear tocreate a tness cost to the organism and may improve susceptibility to other agents.Notably, screening of 2,400 isolates from patients with nonrecurrent melioidosis wasnegativefortheseSNPs.Investigatorshavepostulatedthatasceftazidimeisasyntheticantibiotic,therewouldbelimitedenvironmentalselectionpressureandthereforethesemutations should be rare ( 301-303). Factors governing penAgene expression are still poorly understood, and further research is required ( 287). TMP-SMX resistance was previously thought to be more common and has been reported at 0 to 13% ( 282,284,304-306). However, a study performed on two separate isolate collections in Thailand totaling 3,293 isolates, including repeated testing of theoriginal collection with 13% resistance, revealed a total TMP-SMX susceptibility of99.7%, which is similar to the rates of 99.1% in Australia, 99.2% in Laos, 99.4% inMalaysia, and 100% in Cambodia, Bangladesh, Brazil, and Taiwan of susceptibility were seen with SXT.Gassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 18307,308). The authors suggest that the incorrect results from a prior study were likely due to inaccurate reading of the 80% inhibition zone ( 304,305). Meropenem has a reported susceptibility rate of 100% ( 284,293,298,299,307). It is notable that there is evidenceofdecreasedmeropenemsusceptibilitydevelopmentwhileontreatment,notonly in patients treated with meropenem, although these isolates did not appear tohave cross-resistance to imipenem ( 309). Fluoroquinolone resistance in B. pseudomallei is commonly associated with altera- tion of the site of activity, DNA gyrase. As with other Gram-negative organisms, this isvia a Thr83Ile mutation. This alters the gene gyrA, DNA gyrase, anenzymethatcatalyzesthesupercoilingofDNA( 310).Withregardtoaminoglycoside andmacrolideresistance,AmrAB-OprAandBpeAB-OprBeffluxpumpsplayamajorrole( 311,312). Rare gentamicin-susceptible isolates have been reported among clinical isolates and have demonstrated AmrAB-OprA operon deletion or nonsynonymoussingle nucleotide organisms, B. pseudomallei biolms are associated with ceftazidime, imipenem, andTMP-SMX ( 314,315). The mechanism of resistance is associated with decreased pene- tration and therefore reduced effect of ceftazidime and imipenem ( 315). Notably, differing strains of B. pseudomallei may have altered biolm formation capacity ( 316). Capsule and O-side chain LPS-defective strains are more likely to form a biolm,whereas flagellin-defective mutants produce a lower quantity of biolm than dowild-type (WT) strains. This suggests that flagellin may have a more substantive role inbiolm formation ( 314). Another altered growth condition is that of the anaerobic environment. In this environment, such as an abscess, B. pseudomallei can undergo adaptation with altered gene expression, enabling both anaerobic and acidic environ-mental survival ( 317). Under these conditions, the total population is tolerant of traditional melioidosis therapy. Interestingly, although resistant to standard therapy,these organisms become susceptible to nitroimidazole antimicrobials. Furthermore, asmall subpopulation (0.1%) in this environment is resistant to all antimicrobial therapy( 317). ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLING For environmental soil sampling, culture-based methods may be influenced by factors including soil sampling depth, bacterial soil attachment, soil sample volume,incubation environment, and selective media used ( 84,100,318,319). Multiple sam- plingmethodshavebeentrialed,withvariousdegreesofsuccess( 100,113,116).Based on a review of 69 articles, a consensus guideline has been proposed ( 125). A few specicaspectsofsoilsamplingstrategyincludeasoilsamplingdepthof30cm,a10-gsoil sample volume, and transport of sample at room temperature away from directsunlight. For organism isolation, an extraction broth is suggested, such as Ashdown'sbroth containing colistin or L-threonine-buffered salt solution, with vortexing of the solution, incubation at 40\u00b0C for 48 h, and subculture of 10 /H9262l of supernatant onto Ashdown's agar ( 125). Soil samples taken at a depth of 35 to 45 cm have previously demonstrated the greatest environmental persistence, and more recent evidencesuggests that a soil sampling depth of 60 cm is likely to yield greater recovery of B. pseudomallei ( 114,320). Timing of environment sampling appears to have contrasting results with regard to organism isolation; however, a number of studies demonstratedgreaterisolationinthewetseason( 50,321,322).Interestingly,onestudydemonstrated greater isolation from residential properties in the dry season ( 323). The authors theorized that this was due to increased use of bore water for garden irrigation, ofwhich 33% of water samples tested were culture positive for B. pseudomallei ( 323,324). There are several limitations of culture-based techniques for environmental isolation ofB. pseudomallei . Under certain stress conditions, including low pH or high osmolarity, the organism may persist in a viable but nonculturable state in the environment andtherefore produce a false-negative culture result ( 40). Culture is further limited by overgrowth of other environmental flora, decreasing both isolation and true quanti-Melioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 19cation of B. pseudomallei (114). A further challenge to environmental sampling is the lackofaconsensusguidelineforisolationof B. pseudomallei fromwater( 113,125,324). The identication of the organism from water samples previously included intraperi-tonealinoculationofguineapigsorhamsters,followedbyplatingofthedyinganimal'sheart blood onto selective agar and subsequent identication of resultant colonies ( 99, 325). Subsequently, multiple methods for bacterial concentration from water samples have been trialed, including centrifugation, chemical precipitation, and ltration ( 113, 125,277,326). The use of Moore's swabs to detect B. pseudomallei in flowing water has proven successful in one setting, and although it is an inexpensive and simple method,it does not provide the ability for quantication, and as with soil culture-basedmethods, the environmental burden may be underestimated ( 113). Although no current standard exists, real-time PCR following an enrichment culture has demonstrated a sensitivity nearly double that of culture alone, as well as 100%specicity ( 277,327,328). This technique is also both quicker and less labor-intensive than culture. The current major limitation for molecular detection is cost ( 277). A second limitation is the inability to perform phylogenetic analysis without culturedorganisms, therefore limiting the ability to compare strains between samples andlocations ( 277). The increasing research and use of molecular techniques on environ- mentalsamplesarelikelytoimproveandexpandthecurrentepidemiologicaldatawithregard to regions of previously unidentied endemicity, element PCR (rep-PCR),variable amplicon typing (VAT), and central intermediary metabolism (CIM) ( 329,330). The original ribotyping method was developed in Australia by Lew and Desmarchelier,comparing patterns of restriction fragment length polymorphisms in rRNA geneshybridized to Escherichia coli 16S and 23S rRNA ( 331). Using this method, Currie et al. wereabletodemonstratepersistenceofanidenticalribotypeinWesternAustraliaover25 years ( 332), therefore conrming the of ribotyping an (332).Shortlythereafter,ribotypingwasusedtoeffectivelydifferentiate B. pseudomallei and the yet-to-be-named B. thailandensis (237,333). However, these ribotyping studies reported only a few ribotypes, which were subsequently determined to be heteroge-neous when assessed by RAPD analysis ( 334). In relation to the amount of genome visualized by these techniques, PFGE allows approximately 50% visualization, as op-posed to 0.1% with ribotyping ( 335). Therefore, PFGE was introduced to improve discrimination between strains and was subsequently used in outbreak investigations( 67,336,337).Duetoalongturnaroundtimeandexpertiserequirements,PFGEwasnot widelyadopted.Oneattempttoimprovetheefciencyoftypingwasviaanautomatedribotyping method ( 338). Compared to PFGE, automated ribotyping was double the cost, but it produced similar discrimination with a faster turnaround time ( 338). In an outbreak setting, automated ribotyping may be preferable to PFGE; however, it isimportant to recognize that PFGE has greater discriminatory power than most typingmodalities ( 330,339). More recently, LPS strain typing has been developed using a monoclonal antibody immunoassay ( 340). This method is based on the premise that there are three LPS types which may confer differing severities of disease and may alsohave distinct epidemiologies ( 341-343). The use of LPS typing in an Australian setting revealed a distinct geographical relationship and correlated with MLST ( 344). Further international analysis is required to better understand the future utility of LPS typingboth from epidemiological and clinical perspectives. Compared with the aforementioned methods, molecular typing has greater porta- bility and a robust ability for interlaboratory comparison ( April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 20gation factor), (NADH dehydrogenase), is able to discriminate B. pseudomallei from B. mallei and B. thailandensis (339,346). The MLST appears to be specic for the B. pseu- domallei complex, as it is absent in all other Burkholderia species with the exception of Burkholderia ubonensis , which has a unique sequence ( 346). A signicant advantage of MLST is the ability to compare all strains in a single online database, resulting in thecapability for rapid comparison and international epidemiology analysis ( 345). A draw- back to MLST is the limited number of genes analyzed and the potential to not identifygene rearrangement outside these regions. The eBURST algorithm is unreliable ininferring geographic origin of STs ( 347,348). A supplement to MLST in the setting of isolates of unknown origin may be internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing ( 349). Analysis of ITS length polymorphisms of Burkholderia spp. indicated 10 types, of which types C, CE, and E predominate in Australia and Southeast Asia, while type G isassociated with isolates from the Western Hemisphere ( 158,349,350). Additionally, in vitroand murine virulence data suggest no clear difference between types ( 351). Therefore, this typing method may assist in determining isolate origins but is likely tobe superseded by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) ( 350). Similar to MLST, CIM is regulated by conserved housekeeping genes that encode metabolic function. One study selected 12 CIM genes, as they represented 100%coverage across the 48 strains tested. This study demonstrated a slightly greaterdiscriminatory index for CIM than for MLST, although this was not statistically signi-cant and may be associated with greater sequence lengths of CIM genes than of MLSTgenes( 330).ItappearsthatCIManalysesproducegreaterdiscriminatorycapacityacross different geographical regions, specically, the ability to differentiate Australian andAsian strains with greater resolution ( 330). Thewhole-genomesequenceof B. pseudomallei strainK96243wasreportedin2004. It is composed of two chromosomes consisting of 4.07 and 3.17 Mbp, which places genomes ( 352,353). Chromosome 1, the larger of the two, contains a greater proportion of coding sequences involved in corecell function, such as metabolism, biosynthesis, and motility. Chromosome 2 containscoding sequences primarily associated with organism environmental adaptation, in-cludingsiderophoreactivity.However,italsocontainsanrRNAgeneclusterinvolvedinamino acid biosynthesis ( 353). In comparison to the equivalent B. malleichromosomes, B. pseudomallei has genetic differences of 16% in chromosome 1 and 31% in chromo- some 2. The whole-genome size is 1.31 Mb larger in B. pseudomallei (353). B. pseudomallei isconsideredtobeahighlyrecombinogenicorganism,withanopen genomeexpectedtoresultinnewgenediscovery( 19,354).Thegenomedemonstrates substantial diversity among strains, with 14% of the accessory genome of the K96243strain variably absent from 94 strains tested ( 355). Another study analyzing 37 strain genomes revealed that 74% of genes appear to be associated with the core ( 354). Furthermore, this reference genome contains 16 large variable chromosome segmentscalledgenomicislands(GIs)( 356).Sequencingofvereferencestrainshasidentied71 distinct GIs. These GIs contain specic G /H11001C content compared to the rest of the genome and usually contain mobile genetic elements ( 357). Most GIs are located adjacent to tRNA genes, and these insertions may in fact be mediated by tRNA. Thisallows site-specic integration and recombination (SSR) and has been termed \"tRNA-mediated site specic recombination of tRNA-SSR\" ( 357). Acquisition of GIs appears to beamajorsourceofgeneticdiversityamongbacterialstrains.WhileGIsmayplayarolein virulence, the current literature is inconclusive. An analysis of severe neurologicalmelioidosis in Australian strains demonstrated a specic absence of two GIs ( 358). Additionally, human melioidosis cases clustered based on accessory gene content andspecic GIs compared to those in animal and environmental isolates ( 355). Further characterization of GIs and associated clinical manifestations may aid in diagnosis andmanagement in the future. Inthefuture,WGSislikelytosupersedetheaforementionedmethodsoftyping,and it has recently demonstrated the ability to resolve the origin of two isolates withMelioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 21identical STs from different continents ( 347). Within recent years, accessibility to WGS has increased with the arrival of high-throughput next-generation sequencing and theassociated rapid decrease in instrument and sequence cost. This technology is becom-ing a routine part of public health epidemiological and outbreak analysis. With ourcurrent understanding of the ability for B. pseudomallei to either mutate rapidly under external pressure or persist unchanged in specic environmental niches for years, thediscriminatorypowerofWGSislikelytosubstantiallyimproveourunderstandingofthisorganism in clinical and epidemiological contexts ( 359,360). PATHOGENESIS AND VIRULENCE B. pseudomallei is an environmental organism, with many factors facilitating its persistence and survival in often harsh environmental conditions ( 40). These factors may contribute to facilitating contact with susceptible hosts. Survival has been dem-onstrated in a large range of pH differences, salt concentrations, a range of tempera-tures, and in the presence of detergent ( 361,362). Once B. pseudomallei leaves the external environment and enters a host, the pathogenesis of disease often follows adened sequence of events. In vivoanimal experiments have been extensively utilized, as they reflect the natural disease process and parallel events that occur in humanhosts.Numerousanimalmodelsofinfectionwith B. pseudomallei havebeendeveloped. These include the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , small mammals such as rats, hamsters, and commonly used mice (including BALB/c for acute and C57BL/6 forchronic infection modelling), and large mammals such as goats, pigs, and nonhuman primates ( 363-366). The murine model has been found to be the most applicable, with the type of mouse, route of infection, and infecting dose all adaptable to help mimicvarious disease states encountered in humans ( 367,368). Additionally, genetic and immunological techniques can be employed within these experiments to further ourunderstanding of the disease process ( 369). Host Cell Attachment Intracellular invasion with subsequent survival is a crucial component of the patho- genesis of B. pseudomallei . Multiple virulence factors enhance the ability of B. pseu- domallei to evade host defenses and replicate in host cells. To successfully invade human hosts, B. pseudomallei in its environmental reservoir must attach to and invade epithelial cells and macrophages ( 370). Initial adhesion, demonstrated in free-living with viable bacteriabeingobservedinbothvacuolesandthecytoplasmafterengulfment( 58,371). It is postulated that a similar process occurs in the human host. Mutations in theflagellar structural gene fliCstop endocytosis into amoebae in the experimental setting ( 371). Type 4 pili likely also play a role in B. pseudomallei adherence and virulence. A strain with a mutated gene encoding a pilus structural protein, PilA, showed reducedadherence and virulence compared to those of the wild-type pilAstrains ( 372). Attach- ment to human pharyngeal epithelial cells is mediated via a thin polysaccharide layeraround the bacteria, which binds to the asialoganglioside aGM1-aGM2 receptor com-plex ( 373,374). This attachment is purported as one of the initial steps in the pathogenesis of colonization of pharyngeal epithelial cells and subsequent respiratorytract infection ( 373). Intracellular Invasion B. pseudomallei can be by phagocytes and nonphagocytes ( 375). In nonphagocytic cells, and BoaB are essential componentsfor uptake ( 376). A type III secretion system cluster 3 (T3SS-3) and type VI secretion system cluster 1 (T6SS-1) are essential for intracellular invasion, and subse-quentgrowthof B. pseudomallei andthereforearehighlyconserved( 224,377-379).The T3SS-3 TetR-type regulator, BspR ( 380). Further, BsaN functions as a activating a subset of T3SS-3 andT6SS-1 loci ( regulated by BsaN are essential for transcriptional activationGassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 22(377). Additionally, BicA acts as a chaperone to control the expression of the T3SS-3 transloconandeffector,aswellasassociatedregulatorygenes.TheBsaN/BicAcomplex,by altering gene expression, likely contributes signicantly to the adaptation andintracellular survival of B. pseudomallei within host cells ( 377). The function of the T3SS is to insert a multitude of effector proteins into the target eukaryotic cell which can undermine host cell function and therefore immunity ( 381, 382). The structure of the T3SS traverses the inner and outer bacterial cell membranes, forminganexternalneedle-likeprojectionwhichenablestheexportofeffectorproteinsfrom the bacterial cytoplasm into host cells via a pore created in the host cellmembrane by translocator proteins ( 381,382). Three translocator result in impaired transfer of effector proteins, reduced intracellular replication, reduced formation of multinucleated infected macrophage apoptosis ( BipC also plays a substantial role in B. pseudomallei virulence not only as a translocator but also as an effector ( 385, 386).BipCappearstoaffectadhesion,invasion,actinformationassociatedwithmotility and therefore both inter- and intracellular spread, endosomal membrane lysis and vitroactivity as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, allowing alteration of the host cytoskeleton, with bopEmutants showing decreased epithelial invasion ( 387). Once in the intracellular environment, B. pseudomallei is able to survive within the endosome by production of a protease inhibitor, ecotin ( 388). The organism then escapes the endosome via T3SS, replicates in the cytosol, and localizes to thenuclei of infected cells, suggesting a location of potential intracellular persistence( 389-391). Survival within Macrophages B. pseudomallei multiplies in phagocytes often without activating a bactericidal response ( 375). When lysosome fusion does occur, proliferation of surviving bacteria overwhelms the phagocyte ( 392). For replication pseudomallei purine, pathways( 393). Reactive oxygen intermediates play an important role in controlling intracellular replication. B. pseudomallei suppressesinduciblenitricoxidesynthase(iNOS)expression by activating expression of two negative regulators, a of cytokine signaling3 (SOCS3) and cytokine-inducible Src importance iNOS intracellular pathogenesis is highlighted the observation /H9253) induction of iNOS in activated crucial for optimal clearance of the pathogen ( 395). Additionally, it has been hypothesized that B. pseudomallei delayspolymorphonucleocyteapoptosistofacilitateongoingintracellular survival and propagation of infection ( 396). Intercellular Spread Frenchetal.proposethattheprimarymeansofintercellularspreadisviacellfusion, with T3SS playing a fundamental role in escape from the primary endosome ( 390). Within the host cell cytoplasm, B. pseudomallei induces host actin polymerization, and the organism spreads to neighboring cells that differ from those observed in Listeria,Shigella, and Rickettsia species (399). This is largely facilitated by recruitment of host actin-associated proteins Arp3, p21 (Arp2/3complex), and alpha-actinin, resulting in an tail 399). In the absence of actin motility, the flagellar system is able to compensate and advance intercellular spread( 390). Unique to B. pseudomallei is the employment of other virulence genes, such as bimA, in facilitating intercellular spread ( 400). BimA is a protein involved in actin polymerization, with bimAmutants unable to form actin tails ( 400). In an Australian studyofvirulencefactors,Sarovichetal.establishedthat12%of B. pseudomallei isolatesMelioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 23possessed a mallei gene (bimABm)(401). This study reported a greater proportion of pneumonia in patients with bimABpand a 14-fold increased risk of neurological disease associated with the bimABm variant (401). As aforementioned, BipC appears to have an essential role in pathoge- nicityandvirulence.Kangetal.demonstrated bipCmutantshavingdecreasedinvasion, adherence, and intracellular survival in vitro(386). also showed delayed endosomal escape and actin-based motility, a key component of intercellularspread ( 386). Six T6SS gene clusters are encoded in the B. pseudomallei genome ( 402). T6SS-5 has repeatedly demonstrated a signicant role in both intercellular spread and virulence( 223,379,402). There are two genes which encode vital components of the T6SS, hcp and vgrG(403). Hcp creates tubules which facilitate protein translocation across the membranes of host cells. Valine-glycine repeat protein (VgrG) is required for cell fusionand therefore intercellular organism spread ( 403,404). Impairment of T6SS-5 in B. thailandensis results in marked attenuation of virulence in wild-type strains but not in mice lacking the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent central innate immune adapterproteinMyD88.ThisndingsuggeststhatT6SS-5isutilizedbythebacteriatosurmountthe innate immune response ( 405). Formation of Multinucleated Giant Cells A feature of B. pseudomallei and related species is the ability to stimulate host cell fusion, thought to be partly related to their actin polymerization phenotype ( 384). A result of cell fusion is the formation of MNGC ( 397). The theoretical rationale for this feature is to promote localized dissemination and immune system escape ( 406). These giant cells have been demonstrated in infected tissues ( 407). Inactivation of the T6SS prevents MNGC formation and results in impaired virulence and intercellular spread( 379,406). Several other virulence factors appear to be essential for successful forma- tion of MNGC, including expression of the gene lfpAand with T3SS-3 mutants exhibiting studies have impli- catedtheT3SS-3effectorproteinBipBandthesigmafactorRpoSinformationofMNGC( 384,410). Secondary Spread Secondary spread refers to the dissemination of an infecting organism from its primary site of infection. While not conned to B. pseudomallei , nevertheless, this organism commonly displays this feature. Respiratory melioidosis is a common initialinfection presentation, often preceding bacteremic spread to a variety of sites, such asthe prostate, liver, and occasionally the central nervous system (CNS) ( 8). A study utilizing intubation-mediated intratracheal inoculation in melioidosis. Transposon sequencing with mutagenesis wasused to determine key virulence genes required for in vivotness, by determining phenotypic outcomes after disabling selected genes. T3SS-3, T6SS-5, and capsularpolysaccharide were identied as essential virulence factors in respiratory melioidosis( 411). B. pseudomallei produces a capsular polysaccharide (CPS) ( The antiphagocyticandenablesorganismpersistenceinblood,resultinginincreasedabilityto infect end organs ( 412-414). Virulence Multiple virulence factors accounting for the pathogenicity of B. pseudomallei have been described, with many factors thought to play only a minor individual role invirulence ( 370). The production of a capsule, as previously described, and biolm formation have signicant phenotypic diversity, with the capsule contributing to theGassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 24initial biolm deposition ( 415,416). Multiple other flagella, quorum sensing (QS), T3SS, T6SS, and morphotype switching ( 370, 405). LPS is an immune stimulating antigen, and LPS of B. pseudomallei is comprised of a core, lipid A, and O-polysaccharide (OPS) components ( 417).B. pseudomallei has been characterized as having 3 district lipopolysaccharide antigenic types, with smoothserotypes A and B and a rarer rough serotype ( 418). No immunological cross-reactivity occurs between serotypes, and they share similar macrocyte activation and endotoxicpotency, with serotype A accounting for 97% of clinical isolates ( 418). LPS from a high-virulence strain signicantly activated the innate immune response, suggestingthat the immunopathogenesis of these strains is distinct from that of infections withlessclinicallyvirulentstrains( 419).FurtherassessmentofthelipidAportionsoftheLPS using MALDI-TOF MS were performed and demonstrated substantial structural differ-ences that may account for various host responses to LPS ( 419). This study was limited by the number of isolates used, and subsequent reports suggest that the structure oflipidAishighlyconservedinamultitudeofclinicalandenvironmentalisolatesandthatthe presence of OPS may regulate LPS-associated innate immune responses in me-lioidosis ( 417). Various in vitroand animal studies have shown mixed results for the contribution of flagella and pili to virulence in human infections, and this needs to be further dened( 370). QS, a population density-mediated cell-to-cell communication mechanism, is mediated by signaling molecules, such as N-acyl-homoserine lactones. B. pseudomallei strains with inactivated genes encoding QS pathways have been shown to havereduced virulence in animal models ( 420,421). T3SS-3 is thought to have various roles in virulence in human infection, as described previously. Mutants have been observedto have reduced pathogenicity ( 370). However, our understanding is likely incomplete, with a study characterizing the vacuolar escape defect in the bsaZT3SS-3 mutant as having delayed rather than complete abrogation of virulence ( 409). The K96243 B. pseudomallei genome encodes six T6SS gene clusters, which is greater than for other bacteria ( 402,422). A murine model with BPSS1504 deletion, encoded in T6SS-1, resulted in decreasing intracellular replication and formation of MNGC ( 423). B. pseudomallei various exoproducts, such as proteases, lipases, and phos- pholipases, via the type 2 general secretory pathway (gsp). There is no clear correlationof reduced virulence looking at gspmutants lacking secreting ability, therefore sug- gesting that exoproduct secretion a minor role in virulence ( 424,425). The rpoS gene is involved in the response to nutrient restriction in the stationary phase ofbacterial cell growth ( 426,427).rpoSis associated with regulation of proteins involved inmaintainingtheintegrityofthecellenvelope,and rpoSmutantshavereducedability to repair cell wall damage, leading to decreased intracellular survival in macrophagesand attenuation in animal models ( 428,429). Morphotype switching or variation in colonial morphology is associated with dif- ferent potential virulence factor expression. Mechanisms allowing the bacteria tosurvive under adverse conditions may have key implications for host-pathogen inter-actions and intracellular persistence ( 430). Similar to B. pseu- domallei exhibitssmall-colonyvariants(SCVs)withuniquephenotypicandpathological features ( 431,432). SCVs often have reduced susceptibility to antibiotics and may have an enhanced ability to cause latent or recurrent infection, which may in part be due togreater biolm producing ability and intracellular persistence ( 432,433). Certain colony variants, such as yellow colony variant B, are capable of survival in the stomachenvironment ( 434). Approximately 8% of clinical samples of B. pseudomallei show colonial variation on Ashdown's media ( 435).In vitrostudies have shown increased cellular adherence with SCVs compared to wild-type (WT) isolates, although cellularinvasion and damage were lower in SCVs. Further, using electrophoresis analysis,protein expression was signicantly different ( 436). Different B. pseudomallei morphotypes are likely to have differential epithelial adher- ence and environmental and intracellular survival abilities. Differential expression ofMelioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 25virulence-associated proteins during the mid-logarithmic growth phase plays a key component of morphotype switching and variation ( 436). Further studies will be requiredtoincreaseourunderstandingofhowthisrelatestopathogen-hostinteractionand clinical presentation. Genomics of Virulence and Pathogenesis B. pseudomallei has a complex genome with a high rate of horizontal gene transfer ( 19). Substantial variation among genomes likely contributes to differential virulence, which is often geographically dened ( 19).B. pseudomallei genomic analysis shows variable numbers of genomic islands, with the strain K96243 having 16 ( 353). Further- more, Thai strains, including K96243, contain the horizontally acquired Yersinia-like mbrial ( ylf) gene cluster. In comparison, Australian strains contain the B. thailandensis - like flagellum and chemotaxis gene cluster ( 437). There are several possible metabolic, virulence, and regulatory genes present in a more virulent Australian strain of B. pseudomallei (MSHR668) compared to two Thai strains (K96243 and 1106a) in a mouse model (438). Determination of virulence gene expression using DNA microarrays has been performed using a murine model for both chronic infection phenotype (C57BL/6Th1phenotypewithmoderatecytokineelevation,relativelyresistantto B. pseudomallei infection) and acute infection phenotype (BALB/c phenotype with high cytokineelevation, relatively susceptible to B. pseudomallei infection). These murine models are thought to broadly correlate to disease patterns of melioidosis seen in human disease.Upregulation of bprD, a transcriptional regulator in C57BL/6mice.Further,BALB/cmiceinfectedwitha bprDmutantstrainof B. pseudomal- leihad decreased survival time. This information sheds light on the complex interac- tions of host and bacterial factors, which lead to different disease outcomes ( 439). Ongoingstudiesarerequiredtofurtherdenethegeneticbasisofvirulenceofdifferentstrains. Host Response Several host factors have been observed to increase the risk of contracting melioid- osis, including diabetes mellitus, renal failure, and excess alcohol consumption. Diseaseoutcomes\u2014whether asymptomatic, acute, chronic, or latent disease\u2014are thought tobe determined largely by host response ( 440). An exaggerated immune response with hyperproduction of proinflammatory cytokines can result in tissue destruction andorgan failure ( 441,442). While extensive work has occurred in this area, it is important to realize the contrasting data between human and animal models. Neutrophils play a critical role in host response by killing up to 90% of intracellular B. pseudomallei organisms ( 443-445). Intracellular manner, as B. pseudomallei mutants lacking the T3SS do not induce macroautophagy or bacterial endosome escape into the cytosol ( 446). Furthermore, neutrophils are able to eliminate extracellular bacteria via neutrophil extracellular trapsand promote indirect generation host cytokine response ( 443,447). Importantly, neutrophil phagocytic function in older patients or those with poor glycemic control islikely to be reduced ( 444). The alternative complement pathway is activated by B. pseudomallei , although opsonization with complement does not appear to be essential for uptake into phago-cytes or subsequent bacterial killing ( 397). Antibody-enhanced complement activation is adequate for neutrophil clearance of B. pseudomallei , unlike the case with macro- phages, which are ineffective at clearing serum-opsonized B. pseudomallei unless preactivatedwithIFN- /H9253(448).Neutrophilsareabletoeffectivelydestroy B. pseudomallei and B. thailandensis organisms that attain a critical threshold of complement deposi- tion. Phenotypic virulence demonstrated in vivomay be attributed to the contrasting ability to resist surface opsonization ( 449). Reduced levels of lysosomal fusion are seen inmacrophagesofmelioidosispatients,withresultanthighbacterialburden.Depletionof both neutrophils and macrophages has been shown to enhance infection andmortality rates in animal models ( 447,450).Gassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 26TLRs recognize conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and mediate the inflammatory response via various signaling pathways. Myd88knockout mice have increased susceptibility to B. pseudomallei infection as a result of reduced neutrophilactivity( 451).ItislikelythatTLRsinhumansplayaroleinpathogenesis,with increased expression of TLR1, TLR2, and TLR4 noted in patients with melioidosis andsubsequent decreased expression observed on recovery from acute illness ( 452). The role of antibodies in protection against infection remains uncertain. There is no clear correlation between disease severity and survival with regard to level of antibod-ies measured against LPS ( 453). Recurrent disease has been seen in the setting of high antibody levels in patients residing in areas of endemicity ( 454). In contrast, robust cell-mediated immunity appears to be essential for halting progression of disease. Inanimalmodels,depletionofCD4cellsbutnotCD8cellsleadstoincreasedsusceptibilityto infection ( 455). This, however, does not translate to humans in the setting of HIV infection with depleted CD4 cell counts, where there is no known increased incidence( 456). Cytokines play a signicant role in the pathogenesis of melioidosis, with levels of IFN-/H9253, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-18 associated with increased severity of disease and mortality in patients with melioidosis ( 457,458). Additionally, severe bacteremic me- lioidosis is associated with high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and is correlatedwith poor clinical outcomes ( 459). It is also thought that higher cytokine levels correspond to inoculation burden, rather than to certain virulence factors of theinfecting strain ( 460). IFN-/H9253, often derived from natural killer (NK) cells, plays a key role in the immune response against melioidosis, with IFN- /H9253knockout mice demonstrating higher susceptibility CXC chemokines to the CXCR3 receptor andspecicallytargetactivatedTlymphocytesandNKcells( 461).Althoughnotunique to melioidosis, patients infected with B. pseudomallei had persistently elevated IP-10 and Mig levels which correlated with elevated IFN-gamma levels and mortality ( 461). IP-10 and Mig may aid in coordination of Th1-mediated host defense during infectionby attracting CXCR3-positive Th1 cells to the site of inflammation ( 461). These results contrast animal models showing infection with a moderate cytokine response leadingto a more chronic disease course and potential development of adaptive immunity, aswell as a protective effect of IFN- /H9253in murine models ( 441,442,462). The current literature indicates that acute melioidosis results from ineffective innate cellular immune response and also suggests that both antibodies and Th1-adaptiveresponses are necessary for the successful prevention/eradication of melioidosis ( 448, 463). Although challenging, given the limitations of correlating animal model data, additional human research is required to truly understand the complex host-organismimmunopathological relationship. Figure 6 is a simplied overview of the main stages in the pathogenesis of melioidosis. CLINICAL PRESENTATION The clinical presentation of melioidosis depends not only on the route of infection, includinginoculation,inhalation,and(rarely)ingestion,butalsoonbacterialload,strainvirulence,andhostriskfactors( 279).Mostcommonly,exposureto B. pseudomallei does not result in an infection, and only 1 in 4,600 seroconversion-associated exposuresresults in clinical disease ( 464). Approximately 4% of cases have been attributed to latency as opposed to acute infection, although this is well described ( 279,465,466). The majority, 85%, of patients present with an acute infection, dened as less than 2months of symptoms ( 8). The general incubation period of B. pseudomallei has a mean of 9 days (range, 1 to 21) ( 467). Notably, there are reported cases of late reactivation, with one occurring 29 years postexposure ( 468). Pneumonia is the most commonly reported presentation, ranging from 51 to 61%. Bacteremia is commonly associatedwithpneumoniaandisfoundin55to74%ofpatientswithpneumonia( Table2)(8,12). Thesepatientspresentedwithdyspneaandaproductivecough( 279).Septicshockwas diagnosedin21to34%ofpatients( 8,12).PreviouslyreporteddatademonstraterainfallMelioidosis Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 272 weeks prior to presentation as an independent risk factor for pneumonia, septic shock, and death ( 4,53). Although severe weather events have been linked with outbreaks, only 2 of 13 events were associated with case clusters in one Australianstudy, and no association was found in another ( 55,469). Pneumonia after an inocu- lating event is recognized and thought to occur via hematogenous seeding ( 279). Bacteremic patients often present profoundly unwell, with high fevers and oftenlimited localizing symptoms. Chest X-ray features may rapidly progress from limitedinltrates to diffuse consolidation, abscess formation, and cavitation ( 470). Other common clinical manifestations include abscess formation (most commonly prostate, spleen, liver, and kidney) and genitourinary, skin and soft tissue, musculosk- FIG 6A simplied schematic representation of the B. pseudomallei intra- and intercellular life cycles. Initial nonphagocyte host cell attachment occurs via flagella, type 4 pili, and adhesins BoaA and BoaB. Cellular invasion is facilitated by the injects proteins, and BipD. During internalization the bacterium is enveloped by the host cell in an endocytic vesicle or endosome. Survival within the endosome occurs via multiple processes, including production of a protease inhibitor, ecotin. Escape from the endosome is mediated by the T3SS and subsequent upregulat ion of biosynthesis pathways, including purine, histidine, fatty acid, and amino acid, aid in replication within the cytosol. Bacilli may localize to nucl ei or form a BimA-dependent actin tail used for motility and intercellular spread. The T6SS forms a bridge between host cells and transfers effector proteins whi ch aid the formation of MNGC.Gassiep et al.

This is a higher rate than the 1 to 13% observed inSoutheast Asia. It is possible that decreased clinical and radiographic detection inSoutheast Asian patients contributes to this difference ( 8,79,87,166,167,471-473). Of note, an absence of urinary symptoms has a reported negative predictive value (NPV)of96%,andaurinaryleukocytecountof /H1102150/H1100310 6cells/literhasanNPVof100%( 471). Furthermore, digital rectal examination was negative in 55% of proven prostaticabscesses. A recent literature review revealed just 43 reported cases of primary cutaneous melioidosis( 474).Themajorityofcases(67%)occurredintravelers,withThailand(48%) being the most common destination ( 474). Interestingly, in Australian children, primary cutaneous melioidosis is a common presentation (49%), with only 20% presenting withpneumonia and 16% bacteremic ( 475). In Cambodia and Thailand, children most frequently present with skin and soft tissue infection, suppurative parotitis, or cervicallymphadenopathy ( 110). Cervical lymphadenopathy accounts for up to 40% of cases of localized melioidosis, which is thought to be associated with contaminated watersources ( 105,110,476,477). In contrast, parotitis accounted for only 1% of cases in a Malaysian cohort. Similar to adult presentations, disseminated disease and pneumoniawere most common in this cohort ( 89). An Australian report details the largest noso- comial melioidosis outbreak to date, secondary to contaminated saline and associatedwith soft tissue infections. All 6 cases developed supercial infection that resolved withparenteral and oral antimicrobial therapy ( 478). Cutaneous manifestations of melioid- osis appear to be common in relation to contaminated medical or cleaning products( 362,478,479). In Australia, central nervous system involvement has been reported in 3 to 4% of cases in adults and 7 to 33% in children ( 8,12,475,480). There appear to be fewer reported cases in Asia, with studies from Thailand suggesting an incidence of 1.5 to 3%and a Malaysian study reporting 7.5% ( 167,481,482). The most common presenting symptoms of (82%), headache (54%), and cranial nervepalsy (52%) may include weakness, ataxia, seizures, de- creased level of consciousness, and flaccid paralysis ( 475,480,484). The two most common disease processes involving the CNS include encephalomyelitis and brainabscess( 483).Diagnosisofneuromelioidosiscanbechallenging.Inoneseries,only29% of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were culture positive ( 480). CSF protein was elevated in 71 to 93% and monocytosis predominated in 64 to 67% of samplesevaluated ( 480,483).TABLE 2 Comparison of clinical presentation by region presentationNo./total (%) Australia (8,12,622)Malaysia Pulmonary (54) 225/537 (42) 203/614 36/226 (16) 35/247 b \u2014 10/360 (3) \u2014 5/180 (3) 8/134 (6) Neurological infection \u2014 (9) a\u2014, no data reported. bExcluding prostate.Melioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 29B. pseudomallei septic arthritis and osteomyelitis are relatively uncommon in Aus- tralia, with a reported incidence of 8% ( 485). In this cohort, 25.4% had primary septic arthritis and 31.7% had primary osteomyelitis. Septic arthritis of the lower limb isassociated with a 27.5% risk of associated osteomyelitis of contiguous bone ( 485). Results from Thailand reported that 48% of all cases of bacterial-culture-proven septicarthritis were due to B. pseudomallei , and 8.4% of patients had bone or joint involve- ment ( 486,487). The most common joint affected was the knee (47 to 53%), while osteomyelitis most commonly affected the tibia (44%) ( 485,486). Imaging Various imaging modalities play an important role in the diagnosis and manage- ment of melioidosis. In acute bacteremic melioidosis, the most common chest X-rayfeatures are multifocal nodular lesions which are indicative of hematogenous seeding( 470). Chest radiographs may also demonstrate rapidly enlarging coalescent nodules and subsequent cavitation in this patient group ( 470). In acute nonbacteremic melioid- osis, the most common chest X-ray ndings are that of upper lobe consolidation andpossible cavity or, less commonly, abscess formation ( 470,488). Subacute and chronic pulmonary infections most often present with slowly progressive upper lobe consoli-dation which may mimic tuberculosis ( 470,488). Notably, infec- tion,resolutionislesslikelytoresultinscarringandcalcication( of hilar lymphadenopathy is rare in melioidosis and is more likely torepresent tuberculosis in regions of endemicity ( 470,488,490,491). Computer tomo- graphic (CT) scans of the chest may aid in delineating abscess formation and earlycavitation but may otherwise be of limited additional diagnostic utility in pulmonaryinfection ( 470). Extrapulmonaryinfections,specicallyvisceralabscesses,arecommon,andmultiple modalities can aid in their diagnosis ( 488,490,492). On ultrasound, visceral abscesses appear as hypoechoic lesions, and multiple studies have demonstrated the role ofultrasound in diagnosis of melioidosis ( 492,493). Liver and spleen abscesses are most common, and small \"target-like\" lesions may be suggestive of melioidosis ( 490,492). For prostatic abscesses, ultrasound approximately 85%, comparedwith 99% by CT ( 472). With regard to liver abscesses, the CT scan \"honeycomb sign,\" described as an abscess with multiple loculations separated by thin septa,hasasensitivityof85%,ationofmelioidosisvisceralabscessesappearstofavorCTscan( 472,494). However, in resource-limited settings, ultrasound evaluation of all bactere- mic melioidosis cases may be warranted. For patients with neurological melioidosis, a CT scan was negative in 50 to 73% of cases (480,495). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated either ring- enhancing lesions or leptomeningeal enhancement in all patients ( 480,495). A retro- spective analysis of the MRI of 10 patients with CNS culture-conrmed melioidosisshowed that there was a predilection for involvement of the trigeminal nerves withcontiguous spread to brain stem trigeminal nuclei ( 496). MRI is comparatively more sensitive for diagnosis of CNS infection, including detection of cerebral edema andmicroabscesses, and in the setting of clinical features would be the appropriateimaging modality ( 490). RISK FACTORS FOR DISEASE The age of patients affected is wide, ranging from 2 days to 92 years, with a median of50(8,12,166).Worldwidethereisamalepredominanceofmelioidosiscases,ranging from 58.5% in Thailand to 84% in Singapore ( Table 3)(17,95). In Australia, up to 59% of infections occur in aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (ATSI), which is thought inpart to be associated with an increased prevalence of risk factors in this population ( 8, 12). Additionally, ATSI females account for 38.8% of those affected, in contrast to only 16.6% of females in the non-ATSI population ( 4). Precise data on the mode of acqui- sition of disease are limited. A case-controlled study by Limmathurotsakul et al. hasclaried this to a considerable extent ( 497). The main modes of acquisition in a cohortGassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 30of 414 patients were determined by interviewing subjects. Ingestion, inhalation, and inoculation were all implicated, with exposure to rainwater being an independent riskfactor ( 497). Patients with diabetes mellitus have a signicantly greater risk of infection than nondiabetics, with a relative risk for an infection-related hospitalization of 2.2 (99% CI,2.10 to 2.23) ( 498,499). Additionally, the relative risks (RR) of cellulitis (1.8) and sepsis (2.5) attributable to any pathogen are substantially higher than those for nondiabetics( 498). Diabetes is an important risk factor for melioidosis and has been reported at 37 to 56% in Australian cases, 17 to 47% in Thai cases, and up to 75% in Malaysian cases( 4,12,72,79,87,88). Because diabetes is such a pervasive risk factor, it is critical to understand that the prevalence of diabetes is expected to increase by 20% in devel-oped nations and 69% in developing nations by 2030 ( Fig. 1)(23). The adjusted odds ratio (OR) in case-controlled studies of diabetes in melioidosis cases compared withcontrols has been reported at between 5.9 (95% CI, 4.0 to 8.9) and 12.9 (95% CI, 5.1 to37.2) ( 32,33). In a population analysis, the relative risk was reported at 13.1 (95% CI, 9.4 to 18.1) ( 4). India is the country with the highest predicted number of annual melioid- osis cases, and it has a predicted rise in diabetes prevalence of the total adultpopulation from 7.1% in 2010 to 8.6% in 2030, an increase from approximately 51million to 87 million diabetics ( Fig. 1)(21,23). Diabetes specically alters immune functionthroughdecreasedchemotaxis,phagocytosis,cytokineresponse,andbacterialkilling infection ( 500,501). Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are a vital component of innate immunity and in prevention of B. pseudomallei infectiondirectlyandvianeutrophil-derivedchemokinesignalingofmacrophages( 445, 502-504).BoththePMNresponsetoandreleaseoftheneutrophilsignalingchemokine IL-8 are delayed in diabetic patients, and given that even in healthy individuals B. pseudomallei is a poor activator of IL-8 from lung epithelial cells, diabetics may therefore be at greater risk of infection via inhalation ( 445). PMN phagocytosis of B. pseudomallei is reduced, and the ability to delay apoptosis is lost in diabetic patients. While not statistically signicant in one study, oxidative burst also appeared to bereduced in diabetic patients with melioidosis ( 445). Aside from PMN activity, diabetic patients also exhibit impaired T cell immunity to specic antigens during acutemelioidosis and also reduced activity of IL-23 and IL-10, both of which are likely to beimportant cytokines in the innate immune response to B. pseudomallei ( 505,506). It is interestingthatthediabeticmedicationglibenclamideimpairscytokineproductionandmigration glutathione andglutathione peroxidase, after exposure to B. pseudomallei ( 507). More than 50% of Thai diabetics are prescribed glibenclamide, and this may contribute to the burden ofTABLE 3 Comparison of melioidosis risk factors by region Risk factorNo./total (%) Australia (8,12,622)Malaysia )Singapore \u2014 \u2014 73/317 (23) \u2014 \u2014 262/368 27/540 (5) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014Smoking \u2014 \u2014 245/372 (66) \u2014 92/204 (45) a\u2014, no data reported.Melioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 31melioidosis in that country ( 507,508). Additionally, while glibenclamide may increase the susceptibility of diabetic patients to infection, it may also have a mortality benetassociated with a decreased inflammatory response ( 509). Further research into this mechanism of cellular alteration is required both for prognostication and potentialtherapy ( 507). Alcohol intake appears to be a signicant risk factor in Australia, but less so in other countries( 136,486).Thismayinpartbeduetoreportingbiasandhasalsobeenattributed to religious beliefs, as alcohol is prohibited in Islam ( 17,88,510). Australian studies report that 37 to 52% of melioidosis cases are affected by hazardous alcohol intake at time ofdiagnosis, with an adjusted RR of 2.1 (95% CI, 1.6 to 2.6) ( 4,12). Similarly, chronic lung disease appears to have the greatest representation in Australian data, with studiesreportingaprevalenceof15to26%andRRof6.7(95%CI,4.7to9.6)( 4,12).OneMalaysian study reported the prevalence of chronic lung disease to be 3% ( 88). Theprevalenceofchronicrenaldiseaseinmelioidosiscaseshasbeenreportedat6.0 to 11.4% in Malaysia, 6 to 18% in Thailand, and 9 to 16% in Australia, with a reportedRR of 3.2 (95% CI, 2.2 to 4.8) ( 4,12,79,87,88,486). Other less common risk factor include malignancy (4 to 8%), rheumatic heart disease or cardiac failure (2.5 to kava ( Piper methysticum ) use ( 8,12,79,87). It is interesting that there does not appear to be a direct correlation between humanimmunodeciency virus (HIV) infection and risk for melioidosis ( 456,511). Independent risk factors for presentation with pneumonia include recent rainfall, chronic lungdisease, hazardous alcohol consumption, and rheumatic heart disease and/or conges-tive cardiac failure ( 8,53). Thalassemia is another signicant risk factor for melioidosis. In a Thai study, patients with beta-thalassemia had an 11-fold risk of disease ( 33). A Malaysian cohort of pediatric beta-thalassemia major patients had an annual incidenceof 140 cases per 100,000 population, compared with 0.33 case per 100,000 populationin patients without thalassemia ( 512). Notably, patients presenting with chronic me- lioidosis, representing approximately 11% of all cases, are less likely to have diabetes( 8). Reactivation of melioidosis is associated with chronic lung disease and rheumatic heart disease and/or congestive cardiac failure ( 8). In a region where B. pseudomallei is endemic, risk factors may include simple activities of daily living. A matched case-control study in Thailand identied severalfactors associated with increased risk of infection. With regard to skin inoculation,working in rice elds, an open wound, walking barefoot more than once per week, andbathingwithpondwaterallincreasedriskofinfection( 33,497).Acquisitionofinfection via ingestion was most commonly associated with eating food contaminated by soil ordust and drinking untreated water. Inhalation events were associated with outdoorexposure to rain or dust and current history of smoking ( 497). Information regarding genetic risk factors has increased in recent years. Nucleotide binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) is a receptor able to recognize pathogensand aid in immune function. NOD2genetic variation has been implicated in inflamma- toryandinfectiveconditionssuchaspulmonarytuberculosis( 513,514).Withrespectto B. pseudomallei infection, NOD2-decient mice are more susceptible to pulmonary infection and dissemination ( 515). Additionally, in a review of 1,562 Thai patients, a specicpolymorphisminthe NOD2region,rs7194886,appearedtohaveanassociation with B. pseudomallei infection, which was surprisingly greater in females, with an odds ratio of 12.56 ( 515). Furthermore, polymorphisms in TLRs may have benecial or detrimental effects. A case-control study of melioidosis patients demonstrated bothprotective benet and increased risk of disease with different TLR4genetic polymor- phisms. Interestingly, this study also revealed an association between TLR6-1-10 region genetic variants in diabetic patients with melioidosis, where homozygous diabeticpatients had an 8-fold-lower rate of B. infection specically ( 516). Recurrence Recurrent melioidosis is dened as the new onset of signs and symptoms of infection with culture-proven B. pseudomallei after response to therapy ( 517). Recur-Gassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 32rence may be further stratied into relapse, where primary and repeat B. pseudomallei culture results are genetically indistinguishable, and reinfection, where isolates do notshare an identical genetic composition ( 517,518). In Australia, the recurrence rate is reported at 5.7% with a median time to relapse of 9.4 months (range, 3.6 to 28.0).Relapse is commonly associated with poor antimicrobial compliance ( 8,519). However, reevaluation suggests that an overall improvement in relapse rates may be due to anincreased length of intravenous therapy ( 519). In a Darwin-based study, notably, only 1 (0.4%) episode of relapse was identied from 2010 to 2012 in a cohort of 223melioidosis survivors, suggesting an improvement in eradication therapy ( 519). In Northern Thailand, the most recent study reported a recurrence rate of 6%, which issubstantially lower than in previous studies, which reported that the rate of recurrencewas 13 to 17% ( 517,518,520). Of the available samples genotyped, 75% of cases were dened as relapse; therefore, 25% were reinfection with a different strain ( 510). In this study, the key determinants of relapse were antimicrobial agent prescribed andduration of therapy. Risk of recurrence was decreased by 90% when therapy wasprescribed for greater than 12 weeks, compared with 8 weeks or less ( 510). Further- more, a predictive scoring system was developed to differentiate relapse from reinfec-tion. Taking into account duration of oral therapy, interval between primary infectionand recurrence, season, and renal function, a quantiable score was created using thearea under the receiver operator curve. A score of less than 5 was able to correctlyidentify 85% of patients with relapse and therefore potentially impact treatment ( 517). While most members of the at-risk population do not develop melioidosis in regions ofendemicity, there is a subset of patients that are susceptible to recurrence and maytherefore represent a yet-unknown host-related association with recurrent infection. Latency in melioidosis is also described in the literature, and periods of latency between 18 and 29 years are reported ( 466,468,521). One case suggested a latency of 62 years; however, genetic analysis of this isolate demonstrated a likely WesternHemisphere clade that was distinct from the patient's Southeast Asia exposure history( 465,522). Additionally, it was not determined if the patient had symptomatic disease with the initial infection, and therefore, it is unclear if the presentation representedreactivation or prolonged incubation ( 465). Current evidence suggests that clinicians should be aware of the risk of reactivation in immunosuppressed patients, irrespectiveof time frame, from patients with multiple foci was up to87% ( 526). At that time, trials of third-generation cephalosporins as ceftazidime, broad-spectrum penicillins such as piperacillin, and carbapenems, including imipenem,were underway and were showing promising in vitroresults ( 525). Since then, many therapeutic options have been trialed for melioidosis. Ceftazidime (120 mg/kg of body weight/day) has been shown to provide a mortality benetcompared to \"conventional therapy\" which included chloramphenicol at and TMP-SMX at 10/50 mg/kg/day. In the initial studyby White et al., in-hospital mortality was halved from 74 to 37% ( 527). Further evidence of efcacy followed in a trial of severe melioidosis treatment with combination cefta-zidime (100 mg/kg/day) and TMP-SMX (8/40 mg/kg/day), which revealed a decrease incumulativeday7mortalityfrom47.0%to18.5%comparedwiththatwithconventionaltherapy overall ( 528). Notably, there is currently no evidence to support the use of combination ceftazidime and TMP-SMX, as subsequent trials have demonstrated nosignicant difference in short- or longer-term outcomes ( 529,530).B. pseudomallei is susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and both intravenous and oral preparationsmay be used as a second-line agent in patients intolerant to TMP-SMX or withsulfonamide allergy, or where other agents may be contraindicated due to pregnancyor young age ( 531,532). Notably, clavulanic acid appears to be integral in the efcacyMelioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 33of this therapy, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics assessment suggests a need for increased frequency of dosing to maintain therapeutic levels (intravenous,20/5 mg/kg every 4 hours; oral, 20/5 mg/kg every 8 hours) ( 532,533). Caution is required when using this therapy given an increased risk of relapse and potentialdecreased efcacy ( 531,532,534). ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, have been performed, but theseagents are less active in vitroand are associated with higher mortality ( 285,535,536). Carbapenems, including meropenem and imipenem, appear to have the greatest in vitroactivity against B. pseudomallei (537). Furthermore, they provide a strain- dependent postantibiotic effect that may last up to 3.66 h ( 538). Current therapy guidelines recommend an initial intensive phase followed by an eradication phase ( Table 4)(539,540). The 2014 Revised Royal Darwin Hospital guide- line recommends an intravenous intensive phase including therapy with either cefta-zidime at 50 mg/kg of body weight (up to 2 g) every 6 t o8hi ft h e patient is on the ward or meropenem at 25 mg/kg (up to 1 g) ever y8hi fi nt h e intensive care unit (ICU) ( 540). The duration of this phase is 10 to 14 days for uncomplicated infection or 4 to 6 weeks for persistent septic shock, deep-seated or organ abscesses, extensive lungdisease, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, or neurological melioidosis. The oral eradi-cation phase includes therapy with TMP-SMX, dose depending on weight and age,for a period of 3 to 6 months. For a child of /H1102140 kg, a dosage of 8/40 mg every 12 h is recommended. Dosage recommendations for adults include the following: /H1102140 kg, 160/800 mg every 12 hours; 40 to 60 kg, 240/1,200 mg every 12 hours; and /H1102260 kg, 320/1,600 mg every 12 hours ( 283,539,540). Although TMP-SMX is thought to be a bacteriostatic antimicrobial with time- dependent action, a time-kill study demonstrated that achievable in vivodrug concen- trations appear to have a concentration-dependent bactericidal effect 541). Second- line oral agents include doxycycline and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The recommendedamoxicillin-clavulanic acid dosage is 20/5 mg per kilogram of body weight three timesper day ( 9,283,532). Previous Thai recommendations for oral therapy included a four-drug regimen consisting of TMP-SMX, chloramphenicol, and doxycycline ( 542). However, one open-label randomized trial demonstrated no difference in efcacy ofthis regimen and poorer tolerability than with the combination of TMP-SMX anddoxycycline. Furthermore, this trial revealed that duration of therapy was critical, withpatients receiving less than 12 weeks of therapy incurring a 5.7-fold-increased risk ofrelapse or death ( 543). More recent evidence has shown noninferiority and improved tolerability when comparing TMP-SMX alone and TMP-SMX with doxycycline ( 520). Thus, the current Thai recommendation for duration of oral therapy is 12 to 20 weeks,compared to the Australian recommendation of 3 to 6 months ( 9,510). Research in the Northern Territory of Australia has revealed decreased rates of relapseorrecrudescencedependingondurationofintensive-phasetherapy( 544).With a median intensive phase of 26 days, the relapse or recrudescence rate decreased from5.2%to0.5%irrespectiveofcompliancetoeradication/oralphase( 544).CurrentDarwin guidelines recommend a minimum intensive phase of 2 weeks for skin abscess,bacteremiawithoutfocus,andpneumoniawithoutlymphadenopathyorICUadmission( 540). Four weeks is required for pneumonia with lymphadenopathy or ICU admission or deep-seated collection (abscess anywhere other than skin), 6 weeks for osteomyeli-tis, and 8 weeks for CNS or arterial infection ( 544). This study alters traditional thinking that choice and duration of eradication therapy are the most important predictors ofrelapse ( 544). Further analysis of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis management sug- geststhat5weeksofintravenoustherapyor4weeksforanisolatedsinglejointwithoutosteomyelitis will sufce. Three months of oral eradication-phase therapy appears todemonstrate a similar rate of relapse or complications. However, there is insufcientevidence to recommend a shorter course of therapy for osteomyelitis ( 485). A relapse rate of approximately 9.7% between 1986 and 2004 was reported from Thailand ( 510). This has improved to approximately 6% with an unspecied intravenous phase of atleast 10 days ( 510,520). There is a role for 3 months of oral-only therapy for uncom-Gassiep et al.

Initial observational data suggested that decreased in-hospital mortality from 95 to 10% was attributable to the use of G-CSF ( 548). However, it was subse- quently argued that concomitant improvement in other management factors con-founded these results ( 279). A randomized controlled trial of G-CSF use in severe melioidosissepsisdemonstratedalongerdurationofsurvivalwhenmeasuredinhours,but no overall mortality benet ( 547). The current Darwin guidelines recommend 300 /H9262g of intravenous G-CSF daily for patients with septic shock, initiated as soon as a probable microbiological diagnosis of melioidosis is made and continuing for either 10days or the duration of intensive care unit stay contingent on clinical progress.Contraindications to commencement or continuation include an acute coronary eventor total blood white cell count of /H1102250,000/H1100310 6/liter (540). Source control is an important feature in overall management ( 526). The majority of visceral abscesses, other than prostatic, responded to antimicrobial therapy alone inone study; prostatic abscesses greater than 1 cm should be considered for drainage( 472,549). Fever clearance may be slow, with a median of 9 days in one study, and therefore,thismaynotnecessarilystandasanindicationforsurgicalintervention( 550). While ideal, source control may not be achieved in every circumstance, particularly inresource-limited settings. It is important to note that treatment success has beenachieved with prolonged therapy in the setting of undrained abscesses ( 8,472). Novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of melioidosis are emerging. A novel cephalosporin/ /H9252-lactamase inhibitor, ceftolozane-tazobactam, was developed with specically AmpC /H9252-lactamase-producing strains,anditalsohasactivityagainstanumberof Enterobacteriaceae (551,552).Results from in vitrostudy report the MIC against B. pseudomallei to be 0.75 to 4 /H9262g/ml, with an MIC90of 2/H9262g/ml (553). This study lends support to further research of thisagent as a therapeutic option. While fluoroquinolone therapy has not been recommended based on data demonstrating a 29% failure rate, nafloxacin is a C-8-cyanofluoroquinolone containing a unique chiral C-7 substituent which enhancesits activity in low pH environments ( 554). Compared with those of ciprofloxacin, nafloxacin demonstrates greater bactericidal activity under acidic conditions assays. Furthermore, inhalational mouse nafloxacinwas comparable to TMP-SMX ( 555). Lipid A biosynthesis inhibitors prevent formation of Inhibitors of the enzyme O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)- 556). LpxC-4 is an inhibitor of the LPS biosynthesis pathway and has demonstrated in vitroactivity against B. pseudomallei ,withagrowthinhibitionconcentrationof2 /H9262g/mlpersistingto 2 4h(557). Currently there is limited evidence to demonstrate effective prevention of infection in humans ( 3,526). Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, doxycycline, and TMP-SMX have 10-day postexposure prophylaxis mouse model. TMP-SMX was the onlyagent to achieve 100% survival at 21 days in this study; however, additional murineresearch demonstrated 44% and 83% survival following a 14- or 21-day course ( 558, 559). Current international consensus guidelines recommend a 21-day course of TMP-SMX. Alternative prophylactic therapy study reported that TMP-SMX prophylaxis for hemodialysis patients during the wet season in a region of endemicity is likely to be effective in reducingincidence of infection and that an oral dose of 160/800 mg daily appears to be welltolerated and safe in this patient cohort ( 560). Notably, compared to that in a neighboring region, the study appears to have included a higher proportion ofindigenous hemodialysis patients in rural dialysis centers. This region had a lowerincidence of melioidosis among their hemodialysis cohort, and therefore, rates ofadverse effects, and cost-effectiveness modelling, would not support universalprophylaxis of their population ( 561).Gassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 36PREVENTION Prevention of infection is a critical component of a holistic treatment strategy. Intervention targeting risk factors, both behavioral and medical, is crucial. Further,accurate epidemiological data are valuable in a prevention strategy. Australia has astandard Public Health Laboratory Network case denition and melioidosis is a report-ablecondition,thereforeenablingpublichealthtomonitordiseaseburdenandidentifyoutbreaks ( 562). Additionally, the Northern Territory Centre for Disease Control regu- larly embarks on awareness campaigns to increase community understanding ofmelioidosis( 563).Thekeyfeaturesofthe2015-2016campaignweretoincreasetheuse ofshoesinthewetseasonanduseofgloveswhenworkingoutdoorsandtoencouragepeople to remain indoors during storms, decrease alcohol intake, and wear a maskwhen working with a high-pressure water hose ( 563). The unit provided additional education to all patients diagnosed with melioidosis, with the aim of reducing thelikelihoodofreinfection( 563).InDarwin,Australia,surveysofborewaterdemonstrated 33% B. pseudomallei contamination,andasubsequentstudyrevealedtheefcacyofUV irradiation as a untreated bore water supplies ( 324,564). Further- more, chlorination is an effective method of disinfection of potable water and waseffectively used in control of an outbreak ( 59,67,565). Repurposing of current biolog- ical agents is the polysaccharide derived from chitin,has wide-ranging antimicrobial activity Experiments using chitosan on environ- mental B. pseudomallei isolates reveal a bactericidal effect via disruption of the cell membrane and release of intracellular content ( 567), demonstrating potential for control in soil as well as suggesting the need for further research in clinical models. Anin vitrostudydemonstratedthesignicantandprolongedbactericidaleffectofcalcium oxide in decreasing the risk of infection from contaminated rice eld soil ( 568). AdditionalinformationregardingsoiltreatmentwithcalciumoxideinaThaizoofurtherunderlines the potential benet for environmental control ( 569). This strategy has yet to be implemented due to the unknown effects on the crop, potential ecologicalimpact, and the large volume required ( 568). InnortheastThailand,aregionwheremelioidosisaccountsformoredeathsthanthe combined effects of malaria, diarrheal disease, and measles, the awareness of melioid-osis is lacking ( 17,497,570). Reporting of culture-conrmed cases of melioidosis has been mandated only since June 2016 ( 18). A study of over 4,000 Thais revealed that 74%ofrespondentshaveneverheardofmelioidosis( 570).Thisislikelytobeassociated with a lack of education in schools and limited media reporting ( 18,570). Further investigation into barriers to prevention utilizing focus group discussion revealed that97% of a rural, diabetic, predominantly rice-farming population had no knowledge ofmelioidosis. This study found that providing information alone would be unlikely tolead to recommendation adherence. Barriers to change included time constraints inrelation to boiling water and not wearing protective footwear due to discomfort ( 571). Therefore, a stepwise multifaceted approach at both the community and governmentlevels will be required to improve long-term and lasting prevention of infection. Although the risk of laboratory-acquired melioidosis is low, there have been two documented cases ( 3,572,573). Consequently, a guideline was published in order to prevent infection in diagnostic and research laboratories ( 3). Laboratory staff working with B. pseudomallei should undergo training regarding handling of this organism in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility within a biosafety cabinet ( 3). Additionally, staff are required to wear appropriate personal protective equipment, which includes a gown,gloves, and a respiratory mask if handling infected animal material or during samplecentrifugation ( 3). It is also important to note that country-specic guidelines may differ,andtheUnitedStatesmandatesregistrationandclearancefromfederalagenciesprior to handling or work with any select agents ( 3). OUTCOMES Overall survival is affected by multiple factors, including premorbid host determi- nants. Diabetes, ATSI status, chronic renal disease, and older age negatively impactMelioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 37mortality ( 8,12,166,574). In southern Thailand, septic shock on admission has a reported in-hospital mortality odds ratio of 29.14 to 68.20 ( 79). It has been shown that 73.7%ofpatientswithapositivebloodcultureoccurringwithin24hofincubationdiedduring their admission. This compared with a 40.9% in-hospital mortality rate forpatients whose blood cultures signaled positive more than 24 h from incubation ( 169). A bacteremia quantication of /H113491 CFU/ml has been associated with a 42% mortality rate, while a positive blood culture with /H11022100 CFU/ml resulted in a fatal outcome in 96% of patients ( 267). Although mortality remains high in developing nations such as Thailand, two centers in Australia have demonstrated a remarkable decrease in overall mortality overthe preceding two decades ( 8,12,17). The initial peak mortality of 30% in one facility has decreased to 9% in all patients monitored throughout treatment ( 8). When com- paring presentation with septic shock and death over time, the improvement has beenfoundtobedramatic,improvingfrom100%mortalityto27%( 8).Patientsover50years ofagehaveanincreasedmortality,withanoddsratioof2.0(1.2to3.3),comparedwiththe rate for those under 50. The presence of any risk factor has a reported mortality ORof 9.4 (2.3 to 39.0) ( 8). With regard to bacteremia, repeated positive blood culture after the rst or second week of therapy is a strong predictor of mortality, with an OR of 4.2after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes, blood pressure, pneumonia, and duration ofintravenousantibiotics.Importantly,repeatedcultureof B. pseudomallei fromnonsterile sites did not confer increased risk of death ( 575). The mortality of chronic melioidosis is low and is estimated at 2% in Australia ( 8). In children, the mortality rates range from 7% overall in a prospective Australian study to 16.8% in-hospital mortality from a retrospective Cambodian study ( 110,475). This Cambodian study revealed a 71.8% in-hospital mortality rate in bacteremic chil-dren, and another study revealed a similarly high in-hospital mortality rate (73%) in aThaineonatalpopulationwhopresentedwitheitherneonatalmeningitisorbacteremia( 110,576). Additional prospective data from Cambodia reveal an overall mortality rate of 62% (577). Specically in Cambodia, potential reasons for a high mortality rate may be a combination of inadequate microbiology diagnostic services coupled with empir-ical therapy without adequate B. pseudomallei activity ( 578). Combined Malaysian data report an overall in-hospital mortality rate of 33 to 54% ( 87,88,93,166-168,579). Bacteremic patients have a mortality rate of of 48 to 65%, and nonbacteremic patientshad a substantially lower case-fatality rate, 19%. Additionally, the mortality rate was100% among those patients, while patients without septic shock had a mortality rateof 30% ( 87,167). Genetic risk factors for melioidosis-associated mortality have recently been de- scribed (505). In a study of melioidosis patients in northeast Thailand, HLA-B *46 and HLA-C *01wereassociatedwithanincreasedriskofdeath(OR,2.8and3.1,respectively) (505). A recent evaluation of the TLR1variants common in East Asian populations demonstrated an association with a severe bacteremic phenotype and potentiallyworse outcome ( 580). Conversely, genetic polymorphisms for two flagellin-sensing receptors, TLR5 and NLRC4, have demonstrated survival benet in patients with me-lioidosis ( 581-584). A review of 600 Thai patients with melioidosis infection reported a protective effect with regard to in-hospital death and organ failure in patients with aTLR5genetic variant resulting in decreased function ( 581). A specic NLRC4region polymorphism was also associated with survival in patients with pulmonary involve-ment. Furthermore, coinheritance of both TLR5and NLRC4polymorphisms has a cumulative effect on survival ( 583). It is interesting that while these receptors are requiredforfunctionalimmunity,inthesettingof B. pseudomallei infectiontheyappear to have a potentially detrimental immunomodulatory effect resulting in inflammation-associated organ failure ( 581). VACCINE DEVELOPMENT Due to the current burden of disease and potential bioterrorism threat, effective vaccinesformelioidosisareimperative( 585).BasedonnumerousreportsitislikelythatGassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 38both cellular and humoral immunity will be required to induce complete protection against B. pseudomallei (586). As inhalation is a common route of infection, it is important to note that antibodies are sufcient to protect against lethal aerosolinfection with B. pseudomallei and B. mallei( 587). However, an additional consideration is that vaccination from a public health perspective would aim to protect againstnatural infection and therefore target the population at greatest risk, such as diabetics( 585,588).Thispopulationisatgreaterriskofinfectionviainoculationthanarehealthy individuals from the likely bioterrorism threat of inhalational acquisition ( 585). Multiple vaccine candidates, including killed of vaccine efcacy is challenging ( 585). Yet no vaccine candidate has been trialed in a human model ( 585,588,589). Numerousliveattenuatedvaccineshavebeendeveloped,including(butnotlimited to) mutations of genes for biosynthetic pathways, such as purN,purM,aroA,aroC, and serC, or virulence factors, including bipD,tonB, and hcp1(383,455,590-593). These vaccines have demonstrated protection against both inhalation and inoculation; how-ever, efcacy appears to be dependent on the same route of challenge as vaccineadministration ( 588). In a live attenuated vaccine animal model, et al. demon- strated that nonpathogenic B. thailandensis E555 used as a vaccine showed complete bacterial clearance from the lungs, liver, and spleen on day three after mice werechallenged with B. which is thought to be a signicant factor in developing immunity, with higher B. pseudomallei -specic IgG levels and survival times noted in mice vaccinated with the E555 strain compared to a vaccination with anonencapsulated control strain ( 594). A further study utilized a subcutaneous vaccine of a highly attenuated purMmutant of B. pseudomallei strain, 1026b (Bp82), with immunized mice showing high survival rates after a wild-type (WT) challenge ( 592). HigherlevelsofIgMandIgGwerenotedintheimmunizedgroupthanincontrols( 592). Recent evidence corroborates the necessity of a robust humoral immune response forvaccine-induced immunity ( 593). Using a tonBhcp1mutant in a mouse model, Khakhum et al. demonstrated almost complete sterilizing immunity predominantly viahumoral immunity ( 593). However, due to conflicting results, the role of cellular immunityremainsunclear( 455,593).Themajorconcernforliveattenuatedvaccination is the potential for reversion to a virulent WT strain capable of causing infection. The potential advantages of KWC vaccines are the low production cost and, similar to the case with live attenuated vaccines, the potential to induce immunityvia multiple antigens ( 589). However, as with live vaccines, KWC vaccines are potentially reactogenic, and most KWC vaccines require multiple doses ( 589,595). Results regarding induction of protective immunity with killed vaccines are conflicting.Variable protection associated with heat-killed vaccines may be attributable to differ-ences in immunization organism dose and route of infection challenge ( 596-598). One study demonstrated signicantly superior protection with paraformaldehyde-killed B. pseudomallei vaccine given intramuscularly compared to that with heat-killed vaccines (597). However, a considerable disadvantage to killed vaccines is the potential for altered production of protective antigens in vitroand therefore limited protective immunity in vivo(589). Subunitvaccinescontainonlyprotectiveantigens,maybelessreactogenic,andmay be more readily reproducible ( 589,599-601). Many of the antigens examined directly relate to organism virulence, such as CPS, LPS, or constituents of the secretion systemssuch as BopA 599). with CPS-CRM197 resulted in high IgG titers as well as an opsonizing antibody responseagainst the constituent of the glycoconjugate. Inoculation with Hcp1 and TssMMelioidosis Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 39similarly achieved a high IgG antibody titer and IFN- /H9253-secreting T cell responses against these antigens ( 599). In a murine model of combined CPS-CRM197 and Hcp1 vaccination, mice challenged with a lethal inhalational dose of B. pseudomal- leiexhibited 100% survival. Additionally, this vaccine composition demonstrated the ability to generate a sterilizing immune response with no culturable bacteria in thelungs, livers, or spleens in 70% of the survivors ( 599). Several studies utilizing OMVs (noninfectious particles containing LPS and other immunogenic proteins) have shown increased survival in mice but may not providecomplete protection, as splenic persistence of bacteria was demonstrated ( 602,603). Safety and immunogenicity have been demonstrated in nonhuman primates, resultingin OMVs being a leading candidate for further vaccine development ( 604). Antigenic proteins used alone as vaccine components have demonstrated incom- plete protection against B. pseudomallei infection in murine models ( 601). However, conjugate vaccines have subsequently demonstrated a more robust immune response( 605,606). Unfortunately, although safe and immunogenic, these vaccines failed to provide complete protection ( 606). As there are only limited known vaccine antigen candidates, an alternative approach using in silico-predicted reverse vaccinology was performed ( 607). Candidates were chosen according to predicted antigenicity, physio- chemical and adhesive properties, and afnity for major histocompatibility complex(MHC) class I and class II ( 607). Two proteins which demonstrated seroreactivity with convalescent-phase human sera, together with Hcp1, were linked to LPS and incorpo-rated with the surface of a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) ( 608). A murine model of demonstrated high protein and polysaccharide-specic anti-body titers, and a combination of the andHCP1yielded100%survivalandreducedlungcolonizationfollowingalethalintranasalchallenge with B. pseudomallei ( 607). Cost-effectiveness analysis has determined that vaccination could be a practical intervention in Thailand, especially in at-risk populations, such as diabetics ( 588). In a region with an annual melioidosis incidence of 25 per 100,000 population, a vaccinewith a protective duration of only 3 years and efcacy of 50% costing $2 (U.S. dollars)would be cost-effective. Additionally, a vaccine with the same efcacy and a 10-yearprotective duration would remain cost-effective for use in all diabetics at over $25 percourse ( 588). While further development is required, vaccination could play an impor- tantpartinreducingtheglobalburdenofmelioidosis( 585).However,thedevelopment of a safe and effective vaccine against B. pseudomallei remains currently unresolved. The major barriers are the limited efcacy of candidate vaccines in animal models, themethod of inoculation in the animal models that most reflects acquisition in humans,and the logistic and nancial issues relating to the establishment of phase 3 trials in anareaofendemicity.Theefcacyofanycandidatevaccinewillhavetobeassessedintherelevant risk groups ( has already been used as a bioweapon against both animals and humans ( 609). It has also been implicated in major outbreaks resulting in the deaths of thousands of horses ( 610). Both the former Soviet Union and the United States have considered the potential for use of B. pseudomallei as a bioweapon, but there appears to have been less research into this potential than with B. mallei(609).B. pseudomallei is considered a biothreat due to the high mortality rate with melioidosis, difculty in diagnosis and treatment in regionswhere it is not endemic, and ability to survive outside its natural environment ( 611, 612). Additional features relating to the suitability of this organism as a bioterrorism agentareitsavailabilityandintrinsicantibioticresistance( 609).Itisclassiedasaselect agent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and should behandled within a biosafety level 3 facility or equivalent ( 3,611). Studies have demon- strated the ability of B. pseudomallei to survive not only in distilled water for 16 years butalsoonpaper,stainlesssteel,andpolyethylenecouponsforhourstodays( 163,613,Gassiep et al. Clinical Microbiology Reviews April 2020 Volume 33 Issue 2 e00006-19 cmr.asm.org 40614). It is proposed that with a dense inoculum, inhalation could have an incubation period of less than 7 days ( 609). Therefore, there is concern with regard to weaponiza- tion in the form of aerosolization ( 615). THE ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF DISEASE Due to its prevalence, morbidity, and mortality, melioidosis creates a substantial nan- cial burden in high-endemicity regions. Hospitals and health districts require the resourcesto diagnose and treat melioidosis. The direct cost of melioidosis cases includes specicmedical expenses such as medication, health professional time, hospital admission, labo-ratory services, and patient transportation. Indirect costs relate to productivity. This can bea loss of productivity of both the patient and the potential caregivers ( 616-618). Some regions that are likely to have underdiagnosed and underreported cases of melioidosis arenot equipped to adequately manage the true burden of infection. At a provincial referralcenter in Cambodia, only 17% of surveyed physicians had experience in treating melioid-osis, and the hospital's annual supply of ceftazidime would be sufcient to treat up to 14patients ( 109,578). Additional Cambodian data reveal a mean direct cost to the patient of $565 and that two-thirds of households would have incurred debt ( 577). The mean cost almost equaled the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of Cambodia in 2008. To addfurther context to the direct cost on a household, $565 equates to more than a 1-yearsupply of food ( 619). In a Thai study of two provinces, the estimated annual total cost of bacteremicmelioidosishospitalizationswasbetween$152,159and$465,303.Themajority,75 to 85%, of the nancial burden was because of premature mortality. The average costper fatal case of melioidosis was 2.7 to 2.8 times greater than Thailand's GDP per capita( 616).Empiricaltherapywithacarbapenem,suchasmeropenem,isestimatedtocost$140 per day in Thailand. Ceftazidime has an estimated cost of $5 per day ( 620). There is limited evidencetosuggestthatempiricalcarbapenemtherapymaybecost-effectiveinthesettingof presumed severe melioidosis, as the mortality benet is likely to be modest ( 550,620, 621). With the worldwide increase in prevalence of diabetes mellitus, a major risk factor for melioidosis, the nancial burden is likely to be compounded ( 23,616,617). CONCLUSION B. pseudomallei is increasingly being recognized as a signicant human pathogen worldwide. It presents challenges to both the diagnostic laboratory and the clinician,and early diagnosis is fundamental to appropriate management and survival. Directmolecular detection from blood remains challenging, and the mainstay of laboratorydiagnosis is still culture. The organism is well adapted for intracellular survival, partic-ularly in hosts with dened risk factors such as diabetes and excessive alcohol intake.The clinical presentation of melioidosis can be varied, although pneumonia with orwithout bacteremia is most common. Management and outcomes depend upon anearly institution of appropriate, directed intravenous antibiotic therapy followed by alengthy maintenance course of antibiotics. Vaccine prevention currently remains elu-sive.Inthiseraofglobalizationandwidespreadtourism,anawarenessofthisconditionwill be important.
