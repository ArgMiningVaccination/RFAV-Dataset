There had been conflicts between Eastern and Western medicine for a long time. Eastern medicine is viewed by many people in the Thirdly, the treatment of Chinese medicine and Western medicine is different. Chinese medicine is based on the overall concept and dialectical diagnosis and treatment as the basic characteristics, while Western medicine is to clear the local lesions for the purpose. Chinese medicine believes that the human body is an organic whole, the organs, tissues and organs are physically interrelated, interactively in pathology, interact in pharmacology, so only a disease caused by all diseases, and no disease caused by a disease of the theoretical roots. So it is clear that their treatment is not the Having spent my early years in China, I grew up with both the Western medicine that my parents practiced and Traditional Chinese Medicine that has been passed down for thousands of years. When I got sick, I took painkillers and antibiotics as well as herbal medicine. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, diseases is thought to be due to imbalance of the life energy force qi. While I know about its curative treatments, such as herbal medicine, acupuncture, and cupping, I have always felt it has a greater emphasis on preventing disease from occurring in the first place. A vital part of Traditional Chinese medicine is eating a balanced diet as well as meditating and exercise. I can't speak to the effective of Traditional Chinese Medicine in treating disease, but its doctrines promotes a healthy lifestyle with little reliance on actual medication. Medical care in China is also more hospital based than that in the US. There were very few primary care physicians in China, so people needed to go to the hospital if they wish to see a physician. With large population, wealth disparity between rural and urban area and the sheer expense of medical care, it made sense why some people continued relying on Traditional Medicine. My upbring meant that I was exposed to and more importantly can appreciate that there might different approaches to HERBALISM IN RUSSIA Heather Riley RUSC 101: Culture and Society of Russia 4 October 2015 Thesis: Efficacy of traditional herbal remedies combined with a cultural faith in those traditions, combats modern medicine 's inherent distrust of traditional healing. Accordingly, when providing care for KAs, healthcare providers must take the patient's cultural values into consideration. Maintaining a healthy body, is associated with being harmonious, or balanced, with the body and soul. Therefore, when a person is sick, it is attributed to misfortune or bad luck (Children's Mercy, 2010, p. 25). As a result, alternative medicine, also termed Chinese medicine, is widely used in the Korean culture. Chinese medicine can be traced back to traditional healing from Korea, China, Japan, and other parts of Southeast Asia. In addition, \"traditional Chinese medicine is said to rest on several pillars, the important parts of maintaining and restoring health: acupuncture, traditional Chinese herbs, diet and nutrition, exercise, stress reduction, A busy and hectic lifestyle leads to people neglecting their total health. Sooner or later they look for a way to improve their health and well-being. Certainly, Acupuncture in San Francisco along with Chinese Medicine in San Francisco is on the rise because of that fact. We firmly believe that Acupuncture The traditional Chinese treatment of acupuncture is an affective alternative medicine that has been around for thousands of years. Acupuncture is one of the most researched and documented alternative medicines around (Acupuncture). Although a vast majority of people believe Western medicine is the only cure to sickness, many people benefit from acupuncture everyday. Most people disregard the ancient art all together without giving it a chance because are scared of the needles it involves. Also, since no accurate scientific explanation of how and why it works has been found, people shy away from it. The healing powers of the body are taken to a whole different level with this alternative medicine. Out of the numerous alternative health care approaches, acupuncture is a highly effective treatment and has been an ongoing cure for over 20000 years. The insertion of fine needles enhances the breakdown of energy blockages that are essential for good health. This practice corrects any imbalance of flow close to the skin's surface. To achieve the best results an individual's age and size will determine how deep each needle is required to go to in order for the soothing to commence. As it has been around for centuries, there are many procedures to treat your illness. The theory behind TCM, as said in Encyclopedia of natural Healing, is to start with a symptom, and then look for a specific cause of that illness.One method to help cure your ailment is to use the theory of Yin and Yang.Yin and Yang is what TCM doctors use to help with headaches, smale pain, aches, and tiredness. When a person has too much Yang, headaches will occur along with pain. If you have too much yin, you will experience tiredness or chills. Another popular method of TCM is acupuncture, a very common one this day. It is used to cure pain, and disease. The way it is used is based on the theory of meridians. Meridians are channels throughout the body where your qi can be blocked (Williams 47). Once your qi is blocked, you will experience a multitude of ailments. This is where acupuncture comes into play. TCM doctors lie you down on a table and then proceed to stick thin needles into your body where the meridians lie. By doing this, your qi will be unblocked and your symptoms and will quickly dissipate. Another common remedy are herbal concoctions, mixtures of different plants and animals to cure your ailment. Most herbal remedies consist of a chief, deputy, assistant, and an envoy (Schoenbeck 2035). Each mixture is different for every illness Eastern and Western Medicine The complex structure and foreign nature of Tibetan medicine makes it difficult to relate its practices to Western medicine, making it difficult to determine the clinical efficacy of Eastern medical practice. Several clinical analysis studies have recently been performed in order to determine the efficacy of the \"holistic\" practices of Eastern cultures. Whether the studies show Eastern or Western practices to be more effective, I believe that the most effective treatment should be a combination of both practices. Traditional Chinese medicine, or TCM, is one of the oldest systems of medicine to exist among humans, and it is extremely prominent to this day. According to legend, the system has been in use since the third millennium BCE. The views of such an old system differ greatly from those The Eastern and Western worlds have often had drastically different philosophies and ideologies. In particular, one difference to note is that of medicine and beliefs about illness. In the East, one is responsible for keeping their mind and thoughts healthy in order to stave off illness. An internal affecting the external. In the West, when the mind and body are altered by the environment in certain ways, this causes illness. External affecting internal. These philosophical and cultural differences stem from thousands of years of separate evolution. Traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) began in the third century BC. Traditional Chinese medicine incorporated the idea of balance with the ying/yang from Taoism and an emphasis on harmony, moral conduct and social ethics from Confucianism. The central dogma is that \"the health of each organ depends on its relationship to all other organs, thus nothing changes without changing the whole\" (Scheper-Hughes, 12). Western medicine had a very different history. It began in Ancient Greece with Hippocrates, who wanted to eradicate magico-religious beliefs from health practices and make medicine more rational. This became the norm in the West for over a millennium. This form of medicine was further incorporated into western society with Rene Descartes, who described his consciousness as one thing (mind) and his body as a separate other. Since then, science in the Western world has developed around the idea that these two entities are separate Emily-Rose had just turned 36 and was in her first semester at university when her world began to crumble. This could not have come at a worse time as she has always looked forward to doing a Health Studies degree. Her friends and family were alarmed at the sudden moodiness, insomnia, fatigue, headaches, confusion, joint and muscle pain, nausea nd above all, the enduring feeling of tiredness she complained of. Emily-Rose has suddenly changed from a happy woman to someone who battled daily episodes of what she calls extreme tiredness and anxiety. In the first three weeks of starting university, her husband Harry and sons, Brian and Bob have put this down to overwork at university and firmly told her to \"slacken up a bit\". Although she tried a new relaxation regime suggested by her friend Anita, she still complained of daily episodes of overwhelming tiredness and general malaise. Her weekly part-time care work had all but thinned out due to this overwhelming tiredness; this is in spite of following Anita's suggested relaxation technique. She began to miss classes regularly but confided in Brian and Bob, she will only go to the doctors if things persist into the next three weeks. Emily-Rose is of mixed English-African parentage. Her paternal grandmother Iyabo is African. On Emily-Rose's last visit home, her African grandma confidently confirmed the condition as Kuru, a condition which she says occurred in those days when a woman is about to start early menopause.

The ancient Chinese physicians developed a system of medicine that has survived for over three thousand years. Chinese medicine is complete within itself but that it is based on physiological concepts, theories regarding cause of disease, methods of diagnosis, and principles of treatment that are completely different from the western way of viewing the body.
