Our meditation therapy approach is mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), which teaches clients awareness of how subconscious thoughts and behaviors affect overall health. The American Psychological Association reports MBSR is effective in helping those who practice it to reduce stress and anxiety. That makes it an effective treatment for those struggling with addiction. MBSR therapy teaches clients how to: - Be in tune with one's mental experience with less judgment. - Gain control of cognitive processes and increase calmness, concentration, and clarity. - Enhance attentional capacities and improve emotion regulation. [addiction recovery programs include one-on-one and group therapy](https://cornerstonehealingcenter.com/addiction-treatment-services/individual-therapy/), fitness and nutrition therapy, 12 Step program meetings, and life-skills training. Learn more about MBSR below. HOW DOES MBSR MEDITATION THERAPY WORK? Clients are encouraged to quiet their mind and focus on deep breathing exercises during meditation. Doing this enables clients to immerse themselves fully in the present moment. Clients are encouraged to observe and accept thoughts that pass through without judging them. Practicing meditation strengthens neural networks, which helps clients manage anxiety and stress. Clients develop self-observation techniques that lead to improved self-control, which is essential for addiction recovery. Some benefits of meditation therapy and MBSR include: - Fewer depressive symptoms - Improved ability to sustain attention - Less somatic distress - Better emotional regulation and less emotional reactivity - Boosted focus - Improved self-observation - Better communication skills - Enhanced empathy, compassion, and quality of life In addition to the mental benefits of meditation, MBSR and meditation therapy benefit physical health. Meditation can improve sleep, decrease blood pressure, increase energy, lower sensitivity to pain, and reduce memory loss. These physical benefits enhance the mental gains that are made through meditation. At Cornerstone Healing Center, no meditation experience is needed to start the practice. Clients are guided through MBSR every step of the way. MBSR sessions are taught by caring meditation guides in a supportive environment.
