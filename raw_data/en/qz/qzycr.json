Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center 22 F. INTEGRATED PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT & PATIENT SAFETY (PIPS) 1. Performance Improvement Process The goal of the Dept. of Medicine PIPS plan is to improve the overall outcome quality of patient care through continuous improvement of patient ca re processes and systems. The DOM promotes a coordinated and collaborative approach to performance improvement activities that is based on the combined efforts of multidisciplinary clinicians involved in the continuum of patient care delivery. The Departm ent's PIPS process is supportive of the hospital's mission, goals, and strategic plan and participates in organization -wide performance improvement activities. The performance improvement program within the Dept. of Medicine is comprised of multidiscipli nary activities aimed at improving patient outcomes within the individual clinical divisions and nursing units. Performance improvement efforts are systematic and characterized by process improvement strategies such as LEAN -PDSA : Find a process to improv e; Organize to improve the process; Clarify current knowledge of the process; Understand the source of process variation; Select the process improvement; Plan the improvement; Do the improvement according to the process; Study the results; Act to hold the gain and continue to improve the process. a. Objectives Incorporate the needs, expectations, and feedback of patients, families, and staff into the design of new systems and the improvement of existing processes. Determine the sy stems and processes that are the priorities for design and improvement of the Department of Medicine. Conduct ongoing measurement, assessment, and improvement of the DOM's performance of selected patient care processes and outcomes. Identify key elements of information, (e.g. indicators) required to support the performance improvement process. Ensure compliance with requirements and standards related to accreditation and licensure. b. Design of New P atient Care Processes Processes that are new or require significant changes are designed in keeping with the mission and strategic plan of the hospital and the San Francisco Department of Public Health .

Processes and outcomes of patient care that are high volume, high risk, or problem prone are priorities for analysis, so that stability, predictability, and opportunit ies for improvement can be determined. Specifically, data is collected to provide information on: Productivity/Continuity of Care Provider specific productivity is documented and measurement of continuity of care efforts are collected in accordance with the Medical Group Practice standards. Clinical Indicators Indicators are selected from identified aspects of care determined to be of high priority by the PI Committee, divisions, and nursing units. In addition to selecting indicators based on high volume, high risk, or problem prone aspects of care, indicators and outcomes recommended or mandated by regulatory bodies are monitored, as appropriate. Use of Medications and Error Avoidance The systematic measurement of the processes of medication use, inc luding prescribing/ordering, preparing and dispensing, administering, and monitoring of medication effects on patients, is accomplished through department participation in multidisciplinary, cross -departmental study(s) that include the involved divisions a nd disciplines and pharmaceutical services. In addition to medications which are high volume, high risk, high cost, or problem -prone, those identified through review of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) reported by the hospital Pharmacy and Therapeutics Commi ttee, as well as those identified by the antibiotic order and ARV order sheet process, are of priority for measurement and assessment. The Department upholds the ADR Reporting Program and the Trigger Drug Program updated by the Pharmacy Service that has s ignificantly reduced ADRs. Providers are informed and counseled if they are deemed noncompliant with ZSFG Do Not Use Abbreviations and Medical Record policies. Persistent non -compliance is referred to the Division Chief and the Chief of Medical Service.

The QI Committee reviews the incidents and complications, which are documented during the following committe e meetings: the weekly DOM Morbidity and Mortality conferences, the weekly Cardiac Catheterization meetings, and the other invasive procedure division meetings (Pulmonary and GI). These meetings are protected from disclosure under \"Confidential Document\" p rotected by California Evidence Code 1157\". The DOM adheres to ongoing HIPAA guidelines . d. Assessment The assessment process within the Department of Medicine includes the review of data collected to determine: Trends and patterns of performance over time within the department and in comparison to other areas of the hospital; Comparison of performance with community practice standards and guidelines (e.g. Core Measures, UHC). Community Acquired Pneum onia (CAP), Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), and Acute Myocardial Infarction are among the measures in which the Department and Hospital participate. Systems or processes which require improvement; Efficacy of newly designed or improved processes. Formatted: Indent: Left: 0.9\"Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center 25 Intensive assessment occurs when patterns vary significantly from expectations or external standards, when the divisions/units wish to improve performance, or when sentinel events occur. Assessment of clinical sentinel events and Unusual Occurrences (UO) are condu cted as identified by the Hospital's Quality Management Department and are analyzed by the Department of Medicine's QI Committee and at the Morbidity and Mortality Conference. UO's are categorized and entered into a database for aggregate and systemic anal yses. e. Improvement The Department of Medicine representatives participate in CHN improvement activities as outlined. In addition, improvement of patient care processes can occur within or among the Department of Medicine divisions, and involve other appropriate departments and/or disciplines as well. Potential improvements are identified during the assessment process, and changes in practice are initiated on a pilot basis in the appropriate areas. If data collected from the changed practice in dicates improvement, the changed process is finalized and implemented on a division/unit, department, or hospital -wide level. 2. Program Reporting Structure Reporting of the Department of Medicine's quality improvement ( QI) activities takes place through an established committee structure: Department of Medicine Inpatient QI Committee The QI Committee receives periodic summary reports on the status of performance improvement activities that have been undertaken in all of the department divisions/u nits.

Hospitalists' Group Faculty hospitalists and Inpatient Acute Medicine Nurse Practitioners in the Department of Medicine meet monthly to improve the quality of inpatient care and patient satisfaction. Hospitalists also serve on the Quality Improvement Hospital and Trauma Center 26 Nursing Q uality Assessment Clinical Nursing leaders participate in Nursing PI activities and as members of the PI Committee. They provide continuity and cohesiveness between clinical nursing efforts and Attending/Housestaff patient care. Issues and trends are iden tified and reported to PI Committee and may become interdisciplinary improvement activities. Ambulatory Care Committee (ACC) of the Community Health Network The ACC serves as a forum to identify and address operational and quality of care issues that affe ct the delivery of ambulatory care. Performance improvement activities created in response to these issues are evaluated by the Dept. of Medicine PI Committee, while concerns relating to services provided by the ambulatory care clinics, which are discusse d at the department PI committee are reported to the ACC by the assigned Adult Medical Center representative. Issues that affect Medicine subspecialties are taken back to the appropriate division for action. Performance Improvement and Patient Safety Com mittee The Department of Medicine reports annually to the hospital's Performance Improvement and Patient Safety Committee (PIPS) through its appointed medical staff representative, and other participating department members. A summary of department PI activity is reported from PIPS to the Hospital Executive Committee and to the Governing Body through the Joint Conference Committee. Reporting of PI activities includes a description of the process or function and/or indicator(s), results and analysis of measurement, and summary of actions taken and planned. Reports include a review of action plans, Rules and Regulations, Credentialing, and current indicators for all divisions and nursing units as well as other PI activities that may be inter departmental or relate to a hospital -wide CPI project. 3.

Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center 46 Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center 47 APPENDIX C - MEDICAL STUDENT TRAINING PROGRAM SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL Medicine 110 - Third Year Students Contents: 1. INTRODUCTION Goals, Mechanics, Philosophy 2. SCHEDULES Calendar Team Assignments/Medical Service Roster On-Call Seminars INTRODUCTION Goals (or where to direct your energies) 1. Develop ease in dealing with sick persons and working with health care personnel in relation to delivering optimum medical care in an inpatient hospital setting. 2. Be able to obtain, organize, record and present (written and oral) a complete history, physical examination and diagnostic and therapeutic formulations. A comple te differential diagnosis and understanding of the pathophysiology is more important at this stage than a complete therapeutic plan. 3. Continue to learn a body of knowledge in Internal Medicine. HOW WILL YOU LEARN THIS ? 1. General - Through close conta ct with patients. Digression #1 - Not all students will be exposed to the same types of patients, necessarily making the experience different for each student. Goals 1 and 2 can be realized through a variety of patients. Goal 3 will be accomplished through a combination of ward contact and didactic sessions (conferences and seminars) through which you will be exposed to at least a minimum amount of basic facts in Internal Medicine. Digression #2 - At all times, all patients must be treated with dignity and respect whether or not their personalities or attitudes coincide with yours. Less will not be tolerated. Patient care comes before education. Through this order of priorities will come your most important learn ing. 2. Specifics A. Ward work - Each Medicine ward team consists of a PGYII/III medical resident, two interns, a 4th year student, one or two 3rd year students, and an attending (faculty) physician. Each team may have patients on one or more wards .Each 3rd year clerk will be assigned to work with a specific team. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center 48 There are five Medicine teams. There is no overnight call. Overnight a covering resident team and a faculty hospitalist admits patients. Each team admits every fifth day (\"long call\"). Long call begins in the morning of call. Patients can be admitted to the long call team until 6pm. The team must sign out to the covering night team at 9 pm. All team members leave the hospital and return the next morning for their post -call day. Each te am also admits holdover patients and patients admitted early in the morning (\"short call\" and \"tiny call\") on the third and fourth day of a five -day call cycle. There are four Cardiology teams, each with one resident (PGYII) and one intern. There is one C ardiology attending for all four teams. Cardiology teams take overnight call every fourth night. Third year students will spend six weeks on a Medicine Team and two weeks on a Cardiology team. B. There is also an ICU (Intensive Care Unit) team. No students are on this team. C. Conferences - There will be seminars most days, Monday through Friday, usually from 1:30 - 2:30pm or1:30 - 3:00pm in which topics basic to medicine will be discussed. P lease see schedule outside of the Housestaff Coordinator's office (5H22) for specific topics and their dates. You will meet with Dr. Wheeler's for Patient Presentations Wednesdays at1:30pm. You will also meet with the Chief Residents for basic EKG instru ctions and Physical Diagnosis Rounds. YOUR PUNCTUAL ATTENDANCE AT THESE CONFERENCES IS IMPORTANT. C. Standardized Patients - The School of Medicine has arranged for actors to play the part of patients in these half -day exercises. Sessions will be held on hi story taking and physical examination as well as discussion of advanced directives. These assignments will be based on call schedule and will come from Student Programs. If, for any reason, you are unable to attend this required program please call Lisa Carella at 476 -1964. D. BSCO (Brief Structured Clinical Observation) - Each student will be observed by their attending and a peer interacting with a patient. This exercise will include a part of the history and physical exam chosen by the student and at tending, and should take no more than 10 minutes. These can be done as a separate exercise or in the course of normal clinical care such as during morning rounds. After the observed interaction the attending or peer will provide feedback to the student and fill out a form given to him/her by the student. Two BSCOs from an attending and one from a peer are required...The idea of this exercise is to increase the number of observed student -patient encounters. It does not count towards your grade, but you are required to turn in the BSCO cards to pass the course. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center 49 MS4 Sub -Internship Summary Page San Francisco General Hospital A major difference between your MS3 and MS4 experience is that you will truly be \"learning on the job\" - and you will really be assuming primary ownership of your patients. They will be YOUR patients (along with resident supervision). A new emphasis will be on your critical role in - Communication (with your resident, consultants, patients and families) - Coordination of care - Information management (timely notes, verbal and written sign -out) Goals: - Assume primary responsibility for patient, including new emphasis on communication, coordination of care, and information management - Develop comfort in being first -call for ward pat ients, including learning how to assess and manage common on -call issues that arise - Develop efficiency and effectiveness in prioritizing tasks on multiple patients Responsibilities at ZSFG : 1. Call expectations: - On average, admit 3 patients on call, at discr etion of supervising resident who understands the overall team/other intern census and complexity of patients - Expectation to pass the rotation is that you can admit and manage 2 patients a call night Daily census may range on average 3-6 patients, dependin g on call cycle - Go home post -call at same time as team; sign -out to covering intern with the rest of the team - No cross -cover; cover your patients only 2. Orders: - Write admit and daily orders with your resident. The current electronic ordering system does not allow order entry by students. Legible co -signatures with \"MS4\" for each order - (when written on 4B or other wards without electronic ordering ) 3. Discharge summaries: - You are responsible for discharge summaries at SFGH - All patients must have discharged sum maries in the LCR within 24 hours of discharge. - 4. Days off: - 1 day off per week; specific days are decided with your resident because the resident needs to consider days off/clinic days for other team members 5. Set expectations early with your team - Sit down with your resident and your attending to set up goals/expectations (yours and theirs) - As you know, every team has its own dynamic and expectations, so check in with your resident and attending at beginning, midway, and at the end - If you have a light c ensus, ask your interns, MS3, and resident to see how you can help - they will appreciate your interest in helping the team - Midway through your rotation you will be required to have your resident and attending give you feedback on your performance. There is a Midpoint Feedback card that should document these conversations with items of feedback. If the resident or attending feel you are not able to fulfill the expectations of the rotation at the midpoint you should schedule an appointment with me immediat ely. - Thank you for joining us, and we hope you learn a lot on your subinternship. Have a great month! Please contact me, the House staff coordinator or the Chief Residents with any questions: Margaret Wheeler Site Director, Medicine "}
