LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR INGREDIENTS Our ingredients are rigorously tested for impurities like pesticides, solvents, mycotoxins, heavy metals, bacteria, and allergens. Only after each ingredient passes our stringent tests is it included in our formulation. CAPRYLIC ACID Caprylic acid works by interfering with the cell walls of the Candida yeast. Its short chain length means it can penetrate the cell wall of the yeast relatively easily. It then inhibits the growth of the yeast by incorporating itself into the cell membrane and causing it to rupture. UNDECYLENIC ACID Undecylenic acid is a powerful agent that can help with stubborn Candida-related infections. The fungicidal actions of undecylenic acid come from its organic fatty acid components. It's believed to inhibit the hyphal growth of Candida albicans and biofilm formation. OREGANO LEAF EXTRACT Numerous studies have reported the efficacy of oregano oil's ability to fight Candida infections. This extract has been shown to completely inhibit the growth of Candida albicans and prevent it from returning. Oregano oil contains two naturally-occurring antimicrobial agents, carvacrol and thymol. There is evidence that extract is effective against Candida biofilms. BERBERINE HCL Berberine is the active ingredient in barberry, Oregon grape and goldenseal. It has been demonstrated to have a host of powerful therapeutic actions as an antimicrobial agent. Berberine has also shown action against yeast and fungal infections such as Candida overgrowth. BETAINE HCL This ingredient assists with digestion, maintaining a healthy pH in your gut, and supporting your immune (70% of your immune cells are in your gut). Betaine HCl also has an important role to play in anti-Candida formulations. Other ingredients like undecylenic acid require an acidic environment (which is naturally found in a healthy gut) to maximize their activity. GARLIC EXTRACT One of garlic's most important compounds is ajoene, a natural agent that has been shown to kill off a variety of fungal infections. Ajoene is formed from a compound named allicin and an enzyme named allinase. OLIVE LEAF EXTRACT Olive leaf extract is derived from the dark green olive leaves and contains an active ingredient named oleuropein. Oleuropein has an incredible array of health properties as an antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic and antiviral. It has been shown to inhibit the growth of Candida albicans. We stand behind our products, and your 100% satisfaction is our only goal.

A few of the symptoms are gone, but I am not good at staying away from sweets, so it is taking longer. Had severe bloating for the first few weeks when I took this but after the first few weeks things calmed down and some of my Candida symptoms have gone away. Seems to be working. The kit has been working as advertised - Ive been too strict on the diet either which is impressive. so far it's been 2 months & I plan on ordered another kit once this one finishes. I honestly believe pairing this with a strict diet should kill off any remaining candida colonies Well, honestly, I do not feel any big improvement in my health yet. I eat very healthy. I do like that the candida assist capsules actually smell like the herbs they contain, makes me think they are legit. That's all I can say. Sorry for the 3 stars, but, i just haven't seen results yet. Been 2 1/2 months. This is my first order and I find the delivery was reliable. CandAssist does not need to be refrigerated.
