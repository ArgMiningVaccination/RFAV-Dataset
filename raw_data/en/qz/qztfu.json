The body's defense against disease causing organisms, malfunctioning cells, and foreign particles Pathogens Pathogens: disease causing agents- such as-bacteria, virus, and fungi Patho- sickness agent Gen -to create Gen -to create The Immune System - Defence Against Pathogens In other words, how to stop David from killing Goliath... The Immune System Array of organs, cells and chemicals that: Determine self from \"non -self\" \"non -self\" Identify potential dangers to the body Eliminate them by mounting an immune response The Infant's Immune system... Naive - needs exposure to foreign antigen in order to develop normally Maternally acquired Maternally acquired immunity is temporary and does not protect against all infections. The infant immune system has the capacity to cope with a vast array of antigens at any one time. Immune System Components Source: http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/compone nts-of-the- immune-system Organisation of the Immune System The Pathogen's Journey Will Sickness Occur? The Consequences of Infection... Lifelong immunity (most of the time!) May be innocuous BUT.... May cause serious disease May cause serious disease May cause permanent damage to the host May cause death The Pathogen soon encounters the first level of defence Physical barriers (intact skin, intact mucous membranes, cilia etc....) Physiological factors (eg secretions (complement, interferons) Phagocytes -macrophages and PMNLs Defining characteristic of innate immunity -NO MEMORY PERSISTS . Macrophages - part of the first level of defence Digest most of the micro-organism Regurgitate the antigens Display antigens on Display antigens on their surface so that another type of white blood cell (lymphocytes) can take over. What is an antigen? Microbe Fragments of Microbe = antigen \"Anything that can be bound by an antibody\" The Pathogen Next Encounters the Second Level of Defence Adaptive immunity The foreign agent is recognised in a specific manner e.g -B Cells -B Cells - T Cells THE IMMUNE SYSTEM ACQUIRES MEMORY What is an Antibody? Produced to one specific epitope (ie is antigen specific) Neutralises toxins Blocks adhesion/ cell Blocks adhesion/ cell entry Kills via complement Neutralises viral infectivity and prevents replication. Immune System Superheroes! Macrophages And Helper T Cells T Cells Antibodies (from B Cells) Gone but not forgotten! Memory Cells Once infection has been eliminated, some B and T cells become memory cells These retain memory of the antigen the antigen On re-exposure, powerful immune response. This ability of the immune system to have a memory for previous antigens is the basis for vaccination. How Soon After Exposure to an Antigen are we Protected? Immune response is generated after 4-7/7 >7/7 get Primary immune response (IgM), lasts 3 response (IgM), lasts 3 weeks, memory cells made. Secondary/subsequent immune response, IgG, faster It takes 2 weeks to get optimum immune response after vaccination. In Simple Terms.... Vaccines work by making us produce antibodies to fight disease without actually infecting us with the disease. If the vaccinated person then comes into contact with the disease itself, their comes into contact with the disease itself, their immune system will recognise it and immediately produce the antibodies they need to fight it. The Ideal Vaccine Produces the same immune protection as an infection without causing disease Generates long-lasting immunity Interrupts spread of infection Interrupts spread of infection Vaccines can be broadly divided into two types Live attenuated Inactivated Basic Differences Live Attenuated -\"Weak Pathogen\" A version of the living microbe that has been weakened in the lab so it can't cause disease .Inactive - \"Dead Pathogen\" Produced by killing the disease-causing microbe with chemicals, heat, or radiation. Cannot cause disease Cannot replicate can't cause disease . Vaccines are longer lasting and require fewer boosters However the disease could mutate back to the pathogenic strain eg BCG/ MMR/ Rotavirus/ Varicella/ Yellow fever Cannot replicate Immune response mainly antibody based Antibody titre falls with time 3-5 doses required Classified as inactivated/conjugate/recombi nant/subunit Inactivated -pure -conjugate Fractional Live Attenuated Vaccines Produced by weakening a live pathogen and removing its ability to cause disease PROS CONS Large immune response Good \"teachers\" of the immune system Generally only 1-2 doses needed Need strict refrigeration Could mutate back to disease-causing strain Inactivated Vaccines Produced by killing the pathogen PROS CONS They may not have to be stored as carefully. They will never come back to life and cause the disease.They usually require booster shots because they only weakly stimulate the immune system to make antibodies.Toxoid Vaccines Produced by inactivating the toxin produced by some pathogens eg tetanus and diphtheria PROS CONS Generallyonly need one or two shots They will never come back to life and cause the disease.Require refrigeration Subunit Vaccines Produced by extracting the antigenic part of a micro-organism. Eg hep B and strep pneumo PROS CONS They will never come back to life and cause the disease.They are more difficult to make and require new, expensive technology.How Vaccines Are Made Microbes grown on Microbes grown on suitable medium Purified to remove compounds that could cause allergic reactions (not always possible) Vaccine Components Suspension fluid (water, saline etc) Preservatives, stabilisers, antimicrobial agents a) Trace amounts b) May cause allergic reaction b) May cause allergic reaction Adjuvants a) Aluminium salts - to increase immunogenicity b) Eg hep B , tet, diphth True or False? Several childhood vaccines contain mercury, which is toxic to the nervous system. Thiomersal Mercury containing compound used as a preservative and an inactivating agent In 1999 EU and US manufacturers decided to decrease thiomersal levels in vaccines as a decrease thiomersal levels in vaccines as a precaution and to retain trust in vaccine supply WHO state that there is no evidence of toxicity All vaccines in the infant immunisation programme are thiomersal free Timing of Vaccinations Why are Gaps Needed Between Doses? To allow each immune response to develop eg primary immunisation To avoid immune interference - if another live vaccine is given while the immune system is vaccine is given while the immune system is making a primary immune response, the activation of the innate immune system may neutralise the second vaccine. Hence we wait 4 weeks. Timing of Primary Immunisation Course Maternal IgG is transferred across the placenta Passively acquired IgG can suppress response to DTP , Polio, Men C and Hib for 2 months to DTP , Polio, Men C and Hib for 2 months Maternal antibody to measles may interfere for 1 year. True or False? Vaccinations can \"overload\" the immune system Can Vaccines Overload the Immune System? We are exposed to countless antigens every day, in the food we eat, in the air we breathe, in the water we drink. The human body contains 100 trillion bacteria. The immune system is capable of responding to The immune system is capable of responding to 100,000,000,000 antigens at a given time The MMR contains only 24 antigens. NO EVIDENCE THAT VACCINES OVERLOAD THE IMMUNE SYSTEM Vaccine Failures and Reactions Vaccine failures Primary failure - when an individual fails to respond to the initial vaccine (eg 10% MMR) Secondary failure - responds initially but response wanes over time (most inactivated response wanes over time (most inactivated vaccines) Timing of Vaccine Reactions Inactivated - generally within 48h Live vaccine - according to time taken for virus to replicate Eg MMR vaccine Eg MMR vaccine a) Reactions to measles (malaise, fever, rash) occur in 1 st week b) Rubella (pain, joint swelling) in 2 nd week c) Mumps (parotid swelling) in 3 rd week Adverse events Live vaccine - frequency of adverse events falls with number of doses Inactivated vaccines -frequency of adverse events increases with events increases with number of doses... if antibody levels are good, this binds to antigen in subseq dose, producing an Immune response which, if big enough, is inflammatory HERD IMMUNITY When most people in community are immune to a particular infection that is spread from person to person , the natural transmission of the infection is effectively inhibited the infection is effectively inhibited Vaccine uptake rates >90% (measles "}
