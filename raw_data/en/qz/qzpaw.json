Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs) are developed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ). Each TIP involves the development of topic -specific best -practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of substance use and mental disorders. TIPs draw on the exp e\u00ad rience and knowledge of clinical, research, and administrative experts in various forms of trea t\u00ad ment and prevention. TIPs are distributed to facilities and individuals across the country. Published TIPs can be accessed via the Internet at http://kap.samhsa.gov . Although each consensus- based TIP strives to include an evidence base for the practices it re c\u00ad ommends, SAMHSA recognizes that behavioral health is continually evolving, and research fr e\u00ad quently lags behind the innovations pioneered in the field. A major goal of each TIP is to convey \"f ront-line\" information quickly but responsibly. If research supports a particular approach, cit a\u00ad tions are provided. vii Foreword The Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP) series fulfills the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA's) mission to improve prevention and treatment ofsubstance use and mental disorders by providing best practices guidance to clinicians, programadministrators, and payers. TIPs are the result of careful consideration of all relevant clinical and health services research findings, demonstration experience, and implementation requirements. A panel of non- Federal c linical researchers, clinicians, program administrators, and patient adv o\u00ad cates debate s and discuss es their particular area of expertise until they reach a consensus on best practices. This panel's work is then reviewed and critiqued by field reviewers. The talent, dedication, and hard work that TIP panelists and reviewers bring to this highly par\u00ad ticipat ory process have helped bridge the gap between the promise of research and the needs of practicing clinicians and administrators to serve, in the most scientifically sound and effectiveways, people in need of behavioral health services. We are grateful to all who have joined with us to contribute to advances in the behavioral health field. Pamela S. Hyde, J.D.

FASAM Director Director Center for Mental Health Services Center for Substance Abuse Treatment Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services A dministration Administration ix How This TIP Is Organized This Treatment Improvement Protocol ( TIP) is divided into three parts: Part 1: A Practical Guide for the Provision of Behavioral Health Services Part 2: An Implementation Guide for Behavioral Health Program Administrators Part 3: A Review of the Literature Part 1 is for behavioral health service providers and consists of two chapters. Chapter 1 illustrates typical problems and issues that arise in behavior al health counseling with people who have exp e\u00ad rienced or currently are experiencing homelessness. It covers: Approaches that address the counselor's setting, role, and responsibilities. Screening/assessment, client -centered treatment planning, treatment processes, and contin u\u00ad ing care. Part 1, Chapter 2, presents seven vignettes; each describes the setting in which the counselor is providing services, step -by-step instructions for specific counseling techniques, and master clin i\u00ad cian comments . A d ecision tree is also included in the Francis vignette to help counselors manage key points of therapy. The techniques can be applied to and adapted for other settings. Vignettes are based on role -played interactions staged by consensus panelists. Part 2 is for pro gram administrators and consists of two chapters addressing the following topics about servicing people who are homeless: Collaboration with other service providers to provide comprehensive services Service modifications to meet the individual needs of cli ents Providing training and staffing programs that serve people who are homeless Providing outreach and engagement, intensive care, and ongoing rehabilitation services Resources for implementation of best practices, including sample policies and procedures Part 3 is a literature review on the topic of homelessness and behavioral health services and is in\u00adtended for use by clinical supervisors, interested providers , and administrators. Part 3 has three sections: an analysis of the literature, links to select abstracts of the references most central to the topic, a nd a general bibliography of the available literature. To facilitate ongoing updates (pe r\u00ad formed periodically for up to 3 years from first publication), the literature review is only available online a t the Knowledge Application Program Web site ( http://kap.samhsa.gov ). xi Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Terminology Substance abuse : Throughout the TIP , the term \"substance abuse\" has been used to refer to both substance abuse and substance dependence (as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th E dition, Text Revision [DSM -IV-TR] [American Psychiatric Association, 2000]). This term was chosen partly because substance abuse treatment professionals commonly use the term \"substance abuse\" to describe any excessive use of addictive substances. In this TIP , the term refers to the use of alcohol as well as other substances of abuse. Readers should attend to the context in which the term occurs in order to determine what possible range of meanings itcovers; in most cases, however, the term will refer to all varieties of substance use disorders d e\u00ad scribed by DSM -IV-TR. Behavioral health : Throughout the TIP , the term \"behavioral health\" is used. Behavioral health refers to a state of mental/emotional being and/or choices and actions that affect wellness. B e\u00ad havioral health problems include substance abuse or misuse, alcohol and drug addiction, serious psychological distress, suicide, and mental and substance use disorders. This includes a range ofproblems from unhealthy stress to diagnosable and treatable diseases like serious mental illness and substance use disorders, which are often chronic in nature but from which people can and dorecover. The term is also used in this TIP to describe the service systems encompassing the pr o\u00ad motion of emotional health, the prevention of mental and substance use disorders, substance use and related problems, treatments and services for mental and substance use disorders, and reco v\u00ad ery support. Because behavioral health conditions, taken together, are the leading causes of disa\u00adbility burden in North America, efforts to improve their prevention and treatment will benefitsociety as a whole. Efforts to reduce the impact of mental and substance use disorders on co m\u00ad munities in the United States , such as those described in this TIP , will help achieve nationwide improvements in health . R ecovery: A process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self -directed life, and strive to reach their full potential. Major dimensions that support a life in recovery, as defined by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , include: Health : overcoming or managing one's disease(s) as well as living in a physica lly and em o\u00ad tionally healthy way. Home : a stable and safe place to live. Purpose : meaningful daily activities, such as a job, school, volunteerism, family caretaking, or creative endeavors, and the independence, income , and resources to participate in society. Community : relationships and social networks that provide support, friendship, love, and hope. xii Part 1: A Practical Guide for the Provision of Behavioral Health Services 1 IN THIS CHAPTER Introduction Homelessness in America Homelessness and Behavioral Health Services Stages of Change, Recovery, and Rehabilitation Clinical Interventions and Strategies for Serving People Who Are Homeless Special Issues in Service Delivery Community Housing Services for People Who Are Homeless You Can Do It Part 1, Chapter 1 Part 1, Chapter 1 Introduction This TIP Is for You, the Behavioral Health Service Provider This Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP ) is for you, the beha v\u00ad ioral health service provider or program administrator who wants to work more effectively with people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and who need, or are currently in, substance abuse or mental health treatment. The TIP addresses treatment and preven\u00adtion issues. Some aspects of the TIP will be of primary interest tocounselors across settings, whereas others will be of primary inter\u00ad est to prevention professionals or providers in primary care settings. However, the approach advocated by the TIP is integrated and is aimed at providing services to the whole person to improve quality of life in all relevant domains. The information in this T IP can be useful to you if you wish to: Be a more effective clinician for people facing potential or a c\u00ad tual homelessness. Recognize and address homelessness as a special dynamic that affects your clients. Help prevent potential crises that result from beco ming hom e\u00ad less. Provide preventive services for individuals and families who are homeless, especially as they relate to emergent substance abuse or mental disorders. Be more aware of the effects of psychological trauma and co - occurring disorders (CODs) amon g people who are homeless. Provide integrated, more effective services to people who are homeless. Understand and know how to utilize resources for homeles s\u00ad ness (e.g., permanent supportive housing [PSH] ) in your community. 3 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Understand the significance of cultural competence in your work with people whoare homeless and experience substance use and mental disorders. Influence the understanding of others inyour community regarding the interrel a\u00ad tionship of homelessness, substance abuse,and mental illness. Behavioral health service providers work today in a variety of settings: publicly funded trea t\u00ad ment programs, primary care organizations,hospitals, criminal justice setti ngs, private practice, the military, schools, the community,and programs specifically for people who are homeless. Y ou will find the information in this TIP useful regardless of the setting in whichyou work. Although some content may be more relevant to your work than other content, it is important to have an overall view of howhomelessness, substance abuse, and mental illness interact to hinder recovery and rehabili\u00adtation; how to form a conceptual model to a d\u00ad dress homelessness in y our work; and how to access services available in your community. This chapter introduces you to homelessness in America. It illustrates how homelessness affects people, why it often occurs in conjun c\u00ad tion with other social and health problems,and why it cannot be addressed in isolation. It also provides a brief overview of how comm u\u00ad nities address homelessness and discusses di f\u00ad ferent types of homelessness and how eachinteracts with substance use and mental diso r\u00ad ders. In addition, the chapter discusses your role(s) as a provide r in working with this population. Some of the topics addressed include: The special competencies you will need inyour work with people who are homeless. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes in wor k\u00ad ing with specialized community resources that can support tre atment and prevention for people who are homeless. How to build responses for homelessness or the threat of homelessness into indivi d\u00ad ualized service or treatment plans. How to adapt services to the changingneeds of people who are homeless as theirlife si tuations change. How to help individuals without perma\u00adnent housing integrate with other people in behavioral health service settings. The types of preventive services people who are homeless may need. Provider self -care when working with the problems of ho melessness. The chapter closes with a discussion of how communities can address homelessness and acquaints you with services that may be avail\u00adable in your community for people who are experiencing or who may be at risk for the overwhelming problem of homelessness.Many resources already exist, and it is i m\u00ad portant for you as a behavioral health service provider to understand and actively interact with existing organizations to provide int e\u00ad grated, continuous, and nonduplicative service to clients who are homeless. Structure of the TIP This TIP has three parts: Part 1: A Practical Guide for the Provisio n of Behavioral Health Services Part 2: An Implementation Guide for Beha v\u00ad ioral Health Program Administrators Part 3: A Review of the Literature Part 1 is for be havioral health service providers and consists of two chapters. In addition tobackground information, Chapter 1 illustrates common issues that arise in working withpeople who have experienced, are currently experiencing, or may be at risk for homeles s\u00ad ness. It covers: Background issues, such as the nature andextent of homelessness among clients intreatment, descriptions of models, and 4 Part 1, Chapter 1 principles of care that anchor the practical information the TIP presents. The service provider's roles, competencies, and self -care. Outreach, assessment, treatment planning,the treatment process, and continuing care. Preventive services for people who are homeless. Part 1, Chapter 2, presents a series of vignettes that serve as teaching tools. Treatment v i\u00ad gnettes describe the setting in which a workerprovides services, step -by-step instructions for specific clinical techniques, and master clin i\u00ad cian comments. Vignettes that incorporate prevention interventions describe situations inwhich a behavioral health service provid er as\u00ad sesses prevention needs and either provides services or refers to a community agency.Some vignettes provide decision trees to helpbehavioral health service providers manage key points of service delivery. Most of t he vi\u00ad gnettes are based on role -plays conducted by the TIP consensus panelists. Part 2 is for program administrators and co n\u00ad sists of two chapters. Chapter 1 deals with providing programming tailored to the needs of people who are homeless, including: Tailoring services to the needs of the po p\u00ad ulation. Providing training and staffing to servepeople who are homeless. Providing outreach and engagement, in\u00adtensive care, and ongoing rehabilitationservices. Part 2, Chapter 2, contains sample policies andprocedures that support effective services andcollaboration with other service providers tooffer comprehensive services for people whoare homeless, along with sample forms andlists of steps for program modification. Part 3 has three sections: a review of the li t\u00ad erature on the prevention and treatment of substance abuse and/or mental illness amongindividuals who are homeless, links to selectabstracts of the references most central to the topic, and a general bibliography of available literature. To facilitate ongoing updates (pe r\u00ad formed periodically for up to 3 years from first publication), the literature review is only avai l\u00ad able online at the Knowledge ApplicationProgram Web site ( http://kap.samhsa.gov ). Topics Addressed in This TIP This TIP cover s a broad range of skills and resources useful in work with people exper i\u00ad encing homelessness or at significant risk forhomelessness. For instance, the TIP addresses different types of homelessness: transitional,episodic, and chronic. It provides informat ion on different resources and services for people who lack adequate housing, including emer\u00adgency, temporary, transitional supportive, andpermanent supportive housing resources. Itdescribes a variety of strategies that are i n\u00ad strumental in services to people who are homeless, including outreach, initial screeningand evaluation, early intervention and stabil i\u00ad zation, coordination with other resources inthe community, treatment planning, case ma n\u00ad agement, client retention in treatment and r e\u00ad habilitation, and relapse prevention and recovery management. It also sensitizes clin i\u00ad cians to the special effects of psychological trauma, both as a precursor and a contributingfactor to homelessness and as a secondary out\u00adcome of homelessness. T he TIP considers the effects of co -occurring disorders as a causative factor of homelessness and the special needs ofclients who are home less and have co - occurring substance use and mental disorders. The TIP considers stages of homelessness r e\u00ad habilitation, including outreach and e ngag e\u00ad ment, transition to intensive care, intensive care, transition to ongoing rehabilitation, and 5 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless rehabilitation. It covers a variety of evidence - based practices for both prevention and trea t\u00ad ment. Part 2 of the TIP considers major fun d\u00ad ing resources, inclu ding the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the U.S. Department of Housingand Urban Development (HUD), the U.S.Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), andother governmental resources; staffing; andother information of bene fit to administrators. The TIP is comprehensive in scope and pro\u00ad vides the detail that counselors, preventionists,and other professional staff need to provide services in a variety of contexts to clients witha variety of needs. The TIP describes interven\u00adtion methods that can be used in a variety ofstages of homelessness rehabilitation and methods for pursuing recovery from mental illness and substance abuse among people and families who are homeless. It addresses the importance of the integration of beha vioral health services with other social services and health care. The TIP recognizes the complex i\u00ad ty of providing services to clients who are instressful life situations and may resist or mi s\u00ad interpret the efforts of service providers. Per\u00ad haps most importa ntly, the TIP emphasizes the need for behavioral health systems to a d\u00ad dress the needs of the whole person, includingnot only mental health issues and substance use, but housing, safety, physical health, fina n\u00ad cial, vocational, family, interpersonal, and oth er life contexts. Additionally, this TIP considers content from SAMHSA's Strategic Initiatives (SIs) , which are delineated in the document entitled Lead\u00ad ing Change: A Plan for SAMHSA's Roles and Actions 2011-2014 (SAMHSA, 2011b). The specific SIs addressed include: Prevention of substance abuse and mental illness (SI #1) by creating safe places for people to live accompanied by mental health and substance abuse screening andsupportive treatment. Reducing the potential for and effects ofviolenc e and trauma (SI #2) by providing safe environments and by recognizingtrauma symptoms and providing trauma-informed services. The provision of homelessness services tomilitary families (SI # 3) and veterans , which includes recognizing their special needs and the importance of coordinating their care with the VA. Utilizing recovery supports (SI #4) pr o\u00ad vided by people in recovery from mental illness and substance abuse in the comm u\u00ad nity to support individuals and families who are homeless. Creating public awareness and support (SI #8) for people who are homeless and have mental illness and/or substance use diso r\u00ad ders. Did You Know? There is no typical profile for person s ex\u00ad periencing homelessness. A person who is homeless may be, for example: - Someone who has lost his or her job orexperienced mortgage foreclosure andhas been evicted along with family members. - A loner who sleeps in the park in asleeping bag. - An individual leaving jail or prisonwho has an untreated drug problem and no place t o live. - A runaway teen who trades sex forfood and drugs. - A person in early recovery withoutenough money to pay the rent. - A person with serious mental illness (SMI) who needs long -term perma\u00ad nent supportive housing. 6 Part 1, Chapter 1 - A person kicked out of the family home due to problems accompanying substance abuse. More than 1 in 10 persons seeking sub\u00adstance abuse or mental health treatment in the public health system in the UnitedStates is homeless (SAMHSA , Office of Applied Studies [OAS] , 2006). Keeping things togethe r while being homeless takes considerable skill and r e\u00ad sourcefulness. People who are homeless often have well- developed street skills, r e\u00ad sourcefulness, and knowledge of the ser\u00advice system\u2014important strengths that canbe built upon in treatment. People who are homeless, particularly those with co -occurring mental and su b\u00ad stance use disorders, present particularchallenges in treatment. All issues must be concurrently addressed for treatment to be effective. People with substance use or mental di s\u00ad orders who are homeless are more likely tohave immediate life -threatening health conditions and to live in life -threatening situations. The first steps toward healingmay be access to medical care and a safe and healthy place to live. Trauma is another major co -occurring problem for people who are homeless andhave a substance use disorder. One study found that about one fifth of men and one third of women who are chronically home\u00adless and have substance use disorders also have posttrauma tic stress disorder (PTSD; Jainc hill, Hawke, & Yagelka, 2000). Safe housing i s a point of entry into trea t\u00ad ment for many individuals. When safe housing is combined with services, the cli\u00adent has the opportunity to build strengthsto move from the precontemplation stage through the contempl ation stage to an ac\u00ad tive stage of change concerning recovery from mental illness and substance abuse. Many individuals in early recovery are only a paycheck away from homelessness. People leaving prison or jail with no place to live who have an untreated substance use or mental disorder may lack familial,occupational, and social resources andsupports. People who have experienced multiple ep i\u00ad sodes of homelessness or who have been chronically homeless may be especially demoralized and depressed. In additio n, in prior contacts with service systems, these individuals may have experienced alien a\u00ad tion that will require behavioral health ser\u00advice providers to exercise a full battery ofprofessional engagement and customerservice skills. Why Address Homelessness i n Substance Abuse and Mental Health Programs? Serving people who are homeless in behavioral health agencies is challenging. So, why do it? It is crucial. Housing instability is co m\u00ad mon among people diagnosed with sub\u00adstance use or mental disorders. This instability may take the form of: - Risk of eviction and/or estrangementfrom families. - Risk of homelessness after a stay in jail,prison, or residential treatment. - An inability to maintain adequatehousing over a period of time. Housing stability is key for long-term r e\u00ad covery from substance use and mental di s\u00ad orders; providing housing with treatment and other services reduces relapse (Kertesz,Horton, Friedmann, Saitz, & Samet, al., 2008; Sosin, Bruni, & Reidy, 1995). It is good for your organization. Addressing the root causes of crises caused by hom e\u00ad lessness results i n better client retention , 7 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless efficient organizational function ing, and greater program service diversity . Participation in your community's contin\u00aduum of care for homeless assistance ser\u00advices fosters professional relationships,funding opportunities, innovative pr o\u00ad gramming, and access to a broader rangeof services for the people you are serving. It is good for your community. As co m\u00ad munities develop plans to end homeless\u00adness, increased funding and resources become available to implement programs and coordinate services. Programs are ableto target and respond to specific comm u\u00ad nity needs more efficiently and effectively, and some of the problems intensified by homelessness\u2014such as aggressive panha n\u00ad dling \u2014are reduced. Preventive Services for People Who Are Homeless People who are homeless are at elevated risk for substance abuse, mental disorders , and va r\u00ad ious other physical ailments and social pro b\u00adlems (e.g., unemployment, poverty, victimiz a\u00ad tion). Preventive services can reduce these risks before problems occur or when early signs of the problem are evident. As shown inExhibit 1 -1, the Institute of Medicine (IOM; 2009) divides substance abuse and mental health services into four broad categories:promotion, prevention, treatment, andmaintenance. Prevention services are further divided into: Universal prevention services, which targetentire populations ( i.e., a community, State, or country ). Selective prevention services, which targetsubsets of the population considered to be at risk. Indicated prevention services, which aredelivered to individuals and target people who are exhibiting early signs of problem behaviors. By definition, universal prevention efforts are not specifically targeted to persons who are homeless because they are part of a largercommunity, St ate, or national population. Exhibit 1 -1: Types of Prevention as Described by the Institut e of Medicine Source: IOM, 2009. Adapted with permission. 8 Part 1, Chapter 1 However, people who are homeless may be the beneficiaries of these prevention efforts (e.g.,workplace programs, recreation programs,enforcement efforts to reduce crime, school - based prevention programs for children en\u00adrolled i n school). Because of their high -risk status, these efforts may be especially i m\u00ad portant to persons who are homeless or at riskof becoming homeless. This TIP focuses primarily on selective andindicated prevention , referring to them collec\u00ad tively as \"clini cal preventive services,\" as they are often provided in clinical settings (primarycare, hospitals, counseling centers, etc.). Clini\u00ad cal preventive services include life skills devel\u00adopment, stress and anger management,anticipatory guidance, parenting progr ams, and screening and early intervention. These programs may be designed to directly preventsubstance abuse and/or promote mental healthand may strengthen individuals and familiesand enrich quality of life to build resiliency. T he categories in Exhibit 1 -1 are tools for considering prevention initiatives; they aren 't hard and fast. In practice, they often blend,and a given initiative may fit into more than one category. Housing as prevention Providing housing to people who are homeless can help prevent the exacerbation of substance use and mental disorders or the transition from normal functioning to the first phases ofproblem development. A number of consi d\u00ad erations support this assertion. Homelessness itself is a risk factor for mental and substance use disorders, given the many life challenges and disruptions that people who are homeless face: f or example, stress, loss of social connectivity, increased threats, harmthrough victimization and exposure, and det e\u00ad rioration of health status. Indeed, these risk factors for adults and youth are one reason this TIP emphasizes the importance of preventive services for people who are homeless. Effects may be especially acute in children , for whom homelessness may mean a loss of family stability, disruptions i n school attendance or performance, and being ostracized by peers.Brokering prevention services in the comm u\u00ad nity can help mitigate the impact of these ci r\u00ad cumstances (see the \" C ase Management \" section later in this chapter as well as Vi\u00ad gnettes 4 and 6 in Part 1, Chapter 2 ). Are you a prevention worker in the behavioral health field? When many professionals think of prevention service providers, mental health and substance abuse workers come to mind. In truth, a broad array of professionals in the community co n\u00ad tribute s to the treatment and prevention of mental illness and substance abuse. The com\u00ad munity agencies and organizations listed inExhibit 1 -2 have a part to play in the preve n\u00ad tion of these problems. If your agency or o r\u00ad ganization is on this list, you are a preventionworker. Not only does your community benefit when professionals from a wide range of sectors pa r\u00ad ticipate in prevention; you may also find your job to be easier as well. People with substance use or mental disorders often present signif i\u00ad cant treatment challenges in the community agencies and organizations with which theyhave contact. When substance abuse and men\u00adtal health issues are prevented or identifiedearly, quality of life improves for everyone. It is beyond the scope of this TIP to p rovide an introduction to prevention theory and pra c\u00ad tice. Instead, it focuses on preventive services for persons who are homeless. 9 Exhibit 1 -2: Agencies That Provide Substance Abuse Prevention and Mental Health Promotion Services State G overnment s Public health authority Substance abuse authority Mental health authority Governor's Highway Traffic Safety Office Alcohol beverage control State aging and disability authority State police Corrections County/Local Governments Public health authority Substance abuse authority Mental health authority Tribal governments Courts/probation Local police Recreation departments Area agencies on aging Educational Institutions K-12 schools Colleges, universities Research centers Healthcare Facilities Primary care Specialty care (e.g., mental health/substance abuse, emergency/trauma, obstetrics and gynecology, home health, dentistry) Nongovernmental Organizations Community coalitions Boys/Girls Clubs, Young Men's/Women's Christian Association (YMCA/YWCA), Scouts Fraternal organizations Faith -based organizations Hospitality industry Housing and homelessness service organizations Media Outlets Print Electronic Billboards, bus placards, etc. Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless sources as you assess and work with abst i\u00ad nence readiness in your client s. Solving homelessness is more than just having a safe place to live. Homelessness typically presents along with multiple,complex other problems: substance abuse,mental health issues, medical problems,legal/criminal justice issues, social cha l\u00ad lenges, and so forth. You must be able toprioritize these factors when creating a person -centered treatment or prevention plan and know how to access appropriate supervision concerning these complexities. People who experience homelessness can be particularly demoralized, needing active and often persistent engagement; be flex i\u00ad ble in engaging them, especially in earlierstages of work. Income stability through access to Federal or local income benefits is a critical ingr e\u00ad dient in helping a person who is homeless Recommendations of the Consensus Panel You are a behavioral health professional wor k\u00ad ing with people who are homeless or at risk for homelessness, but most likely, your bac k\u00ad ground does not include detailed training inaddressing this aspect of their lives. This TIPis designed to fill that gap and increase yourunderstandi ng of how homelessness affects a person's ability to engage in treatment orbenefit from prevention. In particular, the co n\u00ad sensus panel recommends the following: Housing access is the bulwark of recovery for a person who is homeless and has asubstance use disorder and/or a mental il l\u00ad ness. Various housing models can be effec\u00adtive in addressing homelessness andsubstance abuse or mental illness. You must be active in identifying housing r e\u00ad 10 Part 1, Chapter 1 reintegrate into the social mainstream. Clinicians and prevention workers must know how to help the people they serve gain access to these benefits. Work and/or education are basic goals for the majority of people who are homeless.These are sources of significant self - esteem, counteracting demoralization andproviding daily structure and a long -term foundation to prevent subsequent home\u00adlessness. You will want to be familiar with community resources for vocational andeducational training and placement. Many people who are homeless have no social supports, but some do \u2014especially those with brief intermittent periods ofhomelessness. Family or close friends canoffer support; be alert to these resources when helping people repair their social networks. For someone with a history of chronic homelessness, you may need to re- conceptualize how to help rebuild his orher social supports. People who experience homelessness en\u00adcounter a range of problems. You can a p\u00ad ply the skills gained from serving this population to your work with anyone e x\u00ad periencing biopsychosocial challenges.Conversely, the techniques you have a l\u00ad ready mastered can be applied in yourwork with people who are homeless, d e\u00ad pending on the stage of change they are in . Homelessness in America How Is Homeles sness Defined? There is no single definition of homelessness;however, most Federal homelessness programs use the definition of a homeless individual provided by the McKinney -Vento Act (P.L. 100-77): An individual who lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence; and a person who has a nighttime residence that is (a) a s u\u00adpervised publicly or privately operated shelter designed to provide temporary living accom\u00admodations (including welfare hotels, congre\u00adgate shelters, and transitiona l housing for the mentally ill); (b) an institution that provides a temporary residence for individuals intendedto be institutionalized; or (c) a public or privateplace not designed for, nor ordinarily used as, aregular sleeping accommodation for human beings. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11302) In other words, a person experiencing hom e\u00ad lessness has no fixed place to live and often dwells in public spaces, shelters, or drop -in centers or may double up in others' homes in atemporary or makeshift way. The more recentHomeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing (HEARTH) Act of2009 (P .L. 111 -22), which amends the McKinney -Vento Act (see Part 2, Chapter 1 , for further detail) , expands the definition (Sec 103, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11302) of a person or familywho is homeless to include anyone who: Resided in a shelter or place not intendedas a home and is now leaving an instit u\u00ad tion where he or she temporarily resided. Is losing his or her housing in 14 days orfewer ; cannot obtain housing through his or her support networks or other resources. Has, at some point, lacked independentpermanent housing for a long period oftime; has moved frequently; and is likely tocontinue doing so as a result of physical disability, mental disorder, addiction, or other barrier. Has experienced domestic violence, sexual assault, and/or other dangerous or life-threatening conditions in a housing situ a\u00ad tion that he or she is leaving. Is an unaccompanied youth who is home\u00adless. HUD (2001) d efines a person who is chron i\u00ad cally homeless as \"an unaccompanied homeless individual with a disabling condition who haseither been continuously homeless for a yearor more OR has had at least four [4] episodes 11 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless of homelessness in the past three [3] years\" (p. 6). Unaccompanied individuals who are home\u00ad less are men and women not accompanied by children or a partner. Disabling conditions in\u00ad clude mental disorders, substance use diso r\u00ad ders, and medical conditions. How Many People Are Homeless? It is difficult t o count the number of people who are homeless accurately because they move frequently. This means they can be counted more than once or missed. HUD has estimated, based on point -in-time counts, that 643,067 persons were homeless at a single point in time in January 2009, of whom237,934 were on the streets, in abandonedbuildings, or in other places not meant forhuman habitation (HUD, 2010). Sixty -three percent of people who were homeless were single individuals and the rest were members of families experi encing homelessness. Anot h\u00ad er estimate using these data arrived at a sligh t\u00ad ly higher number : 656,129, a 3 percent increase over the previous year . The number of families facing homelessness increased by 4 percent over the same period, although the figures are much higher in some States (Ser\u00admons & Witte, 2011). The full extent of the effects of the 2008 recession on homelessness may not be measured for some time. On a single night in 2009, an estimated 75,609 veterans were homeless; 57 percent were staying in an emergency shelter or trans i\u00ad tional housing program, and the remaining 43percent were unsheltered \u2014that is, living on the street, in an abandoned building, or in an\u00ad other place not meant to serve as a humandwelling. Of veterans in shelters, approximat e\u00ad ly 96 percent were individuals and slightly less than 4 percent were part of a family that washomeless (HUD & VA, 2010). For more i n\u00ad formation, see the online literature review inPart 3 of this TIP . Who Is Homeless? People who are homeless come from all strataof society, although the poor are most certainly overrepresented. The high percentage of peo\u00adple of color in the homeless population is r e\u00ad lated to their chances of being poor, not to their race/ ethnicity (Burt, 2001). The National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers andClients (Burt et al., 1999) reported that: About 40 percent of clients who are homeless are African American, about 40 percent are White, about 11 percent are Hispanic, and about 8 percent are NativeAmerican. About 61 percent of clients are men by themselves, 15 percent are women by themselves, 15 percent live with their ownchildren under age 15, and 9 percent live with another adult. Clients who are homeless are concentrated in central cities (71 percent), with fewer inurban f ringe areas and suburban areas (21 percent) and rural areas (9 percent). What Factors Contribute to Homelessness? Both the environment and individual factors contribute to homelessness. Environmental factors Poverty predisposes people to homelessness through a range of environmental factors; 5 to 10 percent of people who are poor experiencehomelessness in a given year (Burt, 2001).Since the 1970s, vulnerability to homelessness has increased among the poor as access to a f\u00ad fordable housing, social safety n ets (e.g., hou s\u00ad ing/income subsidies, affordable health care, hospitalization), and adequate income havedecreased. In addition: Housing costs price many people withbelow- poverty incomes (e.g., very low- income families and single adults) out ofthe market (Burt, 2001). More than 14 12 Part 1, Chapter 1 million families have \"worst -c ase housing n eeds,\" defined as spending more than 5 0 percent of monthly income on rent (Lipman, 2002). The removal of institutional supports (e.g., deinstitutionalization) has resulted in few\u00ader hou sing options for people diagnosed with SMI (Burt, 2001). It is critical that housing issues be addressed in dispositionplanning when individuals are dischargedfrom inpatient or outpatient mental health or substance abuse treatment settings. Cl i\u00ad ents leaving intensive treatment settings who do not have adequate housing to sup\u00adport their recovery have a significantly higher risk of relapse. Decreased job options for people wi th high school educations and increasing di s\u00ad parity between minimum wage and cost of living have made it increasingly difficult to earn enough money to afford housing(Burt, 2001). Environmental factors affecting vulnerability to homelessness relate d irectly to community resources. Community solutions for preven t\u00ad ing homelessness and ending chronic hom e\u00ad lessness include affordable housing, access to permanent supportive housing for clients with mental illness and substance use disorders, im\u00ad proved schools, training, prison transition pr o\u00ad grams, job opportunities, and support services (Burt, 2001). Individual factors In addition to substance use and mental diso r\u00ad ders, a range of complex, interrelated individ u\u00ad al risk factors are related to homelessness, including trauma -related symptoms, cognitive impairment, medical conditions, lack of sup\u00adport from family, limited education and job skills, and incarceration (for more detail, see the literature review in Part 3 of this TIP , which is available online at the KAP Web site (http://kap.samhsa.gov ). A significant pe r\u00adcentage of individuals who are homeless will likely experience at least one of these issues.For example: Mares and Rosenheck (2004) found thatveterans who are homeless report thatthree aspects of their servic e contributed to their homelessn ess: substance abuse b e\u00ad ginning in the military (75 percent), ina d\u00ad equate preparation for civilianemployment (68 percent), and loss ofstructure (68 percent). People who have or have had mood diso r\u00ad ders, schizophrenia, antisocial personality disorder, or any substance use disorder are at least two times more likely to have beenhomeless than those without these diagn o\u00ad ses (Greenberg & Rosenheck, 2010a,b ). Of people who are homeless and in sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment , 68 percent of men and 76 to 100 per cent of women report trauma -related events (Christensen et al., 2005; Jainchill et al., 2000), similar to rates reported by general samples of people whoare homeless. As many as 80 percent of people who are homeless exhibit cognitive impairment,which can affect their social and adaptivefunctioning and their ability to learn newinformation and new skills (Spence, Stevens, & Parks, 2004). People who are homeless have high rates of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, cardiovascular conditions, dental problems, asthma, di a\u00ad betes, and other medical problems (Klinkenberg et al., 2003; Magura,Nwakeze, Rosenblum, & Joseph, 2000;Schanzer, Dominguez, Shrout, & Caton, 2007). Lack of familial support increases the risk of episodic and chronic homelessness andmanifests as disconnection from family, childhood placement in foster care or ot h\u00ad er institutions (27 percent), and childhood physical and/or sexual abuse by family members (25 percent; Burt et al., 1999). 13 Mikki Mikki is transitionally homeless . Her boyfriend (who is also the father of her youngest child) has left her. He promised financial support for Mikki and the two children, ages 7 and 3, but only provided money for a few months. Mikki was evicted from her apartment 3 weeks ago and has been living with her children in the family car, which won't start. When the children come down with bad colds, she takes them to the c ommunity health center. Mikki has become progressively more depressed as a result of her breakup and the stress of hom e\u00ad lessness. She has begun drinking at night to sleep. The case manager in the community health center helped her arrange temporary emergency housing until more stable transitional or permanent sup\u00ad portive housing can be arranged. He also referred her for a psychiatric evaluation and worked with the school system to provide supportive and preventive services to the children. One of his primary goals has been to intervene before a pattern of long -term homelessness is established. The case manager is also cognizant that Mikki's co -occurring depression and substance abuse must be a d\u00ad dressed as part of a larger treatment plan that includes adequate housing, employment, financial support, child care, and services for mental health and substance abuse treatment. Part 1, Chapter 2, describes how the caseworker helps Mikki obtain these services. B ehavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Thirty -eight percent of people who were homeless and received services in 199 6 lacked a high school diploma or equivalent (Burt et al., 1999). Incarceration is common among people who have experienced homelessness (54percent of tho se who received services in 1996; Burt et al., 1999). Many individualsleaving prison have no place to live andseek housing through community r e\u00ad sources for homelessness. Are There Different Types of Homelessness? Surveys conducted with people who ar e homeless indicate that there is a continuum of homelessness (Burt, Aron, Lee, & Valente, 2001). This section offers brief explanations of the types of homelessness, the prevalence ofeach, and illustrative vignettes. Transitional homelessness A first or second episode of homelessness, ranging from a few weeks or months to less than a year, is considered transitional hom e\u00ad lessness. About half of the homeless popula\u00adtion falls into this category, including many families who are homeless. Families are likely to qualify for public assistance programs, sothey are less likely to be homeless or to be homeless for long periods. People leaving pri s\u00ad on or jail may be transitionally homeless. Episodic homelessness Episodic homelessness means entering andleaving homelessness (e.g., shelters) repeatedly.Between episodes of homelessness, a personmight be tenuously housed (in his or her ownhousing or living with friends/relatives) and at high risk for becoming homeless again. Aboutone fourth of people who are homeless have gone in and out of homelessness numerous times (Burt et al., 2001). Chronic homelessness About a quarter of people who are homeless have been continuously so for at least 5 years (Burt et al., 2001). Engaging people who arechronically homeless in housing and otherservices requires willingness to provide hou s\u00ad ing and serv ices that are attractive to client s. How Do Communities Respond to Homelessness? Homelessness is a broad social problem, and 14 Francis Francis is chronically homeless . He has lived in a subway tunnel for some time and is known to the staff of the local homeless program. It 's been more than 5 years since he had a home. His medical records indicate that he has an intelligence quotient ( IQ) of about 70, possible cognitive impairment from an old injury , and diabetes. With cold weather predicted, the o utreach a nd engagement team want to see how he is functioning, if he has immediate needs, and whether he will accept shelter. Techniques for engaging Francis into appropriate services are illustrated in Part 1, Chapter 2. The importance of cultural compete nce in working with Francis is shown in the vignette. Roxanne Roxanne is episodically homeless . She has a history of illicitly using and selling extended -release oxycodone and other opioid drugs. She has been diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. She lived with friends until they tired of her drug use and erratic behavior. Roxanne now lives in single room occupancy (SRO) housing. Roxanne's drug use and erratic behavior make it hard for her to hold a job. She occasionally engages in prostitution and sells pain pills for income. She's been told not to bring customers to the SRO but sometimes brings them anyway. Failing to follow the rules puts her at risk of ending up back on the street. Roxanne's behavior and risk of eviction predispose her to vi c\u00ad timization. Although currently housed, Roxanne has a long history of episodic homelessness begi n\u00ad ning in childhood. As an adult without family, she is ineligible for most safety-net programs, so she is at risk for continued episodic homelessness. Part 1, Chapter 2, shows how her counselor helps ready her for services to reduce risk of homeles s\u00ad ness, address pervasive trauma symptoms that interfere with life functioning, and maintain commi t\u00ad ment to mental health and substance abuse treatment and recovery. Part 1, Chapter 1 communities have established a range of strategies to ma nage homelessness. On one hand, faced with demands from business own\u00aders and other citizens, some public officials have turned to criminal justice solutions torespond to street homelessness. Legal measures include prohibition of sleeping,camping, beggin g or panhandling, and storing personal possessions in public areas. Othertrends restrict serving food to the poor andhomeless in public places. Such measures canimpede provision of services and create add i\u00ad tional barriers to recovery (such as criminal records), which can delay access to housing and decrease eligibility for employment. On the other hand, a growing number of States and communities are adopting progre s\u00ad sive initiatives , including the development of drug, mental health, and homelessness courts , which divert people who are homeless from incarceration; mobile crisis teams working intandem with police trained to respond topeople who are homeless; programs to bridge reentry into the community for people exiting the criminal justice system; and specializedcommunity services, such as crisis intervention beds, sobering stations, and homelessness as\u00ad sistance centers. As of August 2007, more than300 communities had formal plans to endchronic homelessness (see the U.S. InteragencyCouncil on Homelessness [USICH] Web site at http://www.usich.go v) and were offering a wide range of treatment and housing services to meet this goal. A particularly progressive initiative is the pr o\u00ad vision of permanent and transitional suppor t\u00ad ive housing, which offers stable, safe, affordable , long-term housing for individuals and families who would otherwise be homeless. Permanent supportive housing provides long -term hou s- 15 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless ing and supportive services to people with physical disabilities, mental illness, or otherlong-term impairments (such as developmen\u00ad tal disabilities) that limit the individual's abil\u00adity to maintain housing without assistance.Transitional supportive housing provides st a\u00ad ble housing along with social and health ser\u00advices but is more often used with individuals and families in crisis or transition. PSH helps eligible people find a permanent home and obtain needed mental health and substance abuse treatment services. An i m\u00ad portant comp onent of PSH is that housing is not contingent on whether an individual o b\u00ad tains mental health, substance abuse, or other services, but rather, allows the individual to decide when and how to seek out services. PSH supports individuals in choosing theirown living arrangements and helps them ac\u00ad cess services based on the support they need atany given time. An example of a cand idate for transitional housing is an individual leaving addiction treatment who has no place to live, needs asober environment to support recovery, andcan be expected to regain employment in the near future. Transitional housing is normally limited to 2 years. Some of the social andhealth services frequently offered in supportive housing include mental health and substance abuse treatment, employment services, jobtraining, life skills training, interpersonal skills development, medical case management, and coping skills training. Transitional and perm a\u00ad nent supportive housing can range from arooming house with individuals having theirown rooms to clusters of small apartments in asingle location to scattered -site programs in which rent subsidies are pro vided for individu\u00ad als and families to have a home in the greatercommunity. A major support for persons in need is SAMHSA's Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) program. Administered by the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) , PATH is part of a formula grant to States and provide s minimal housing assistance for individuals. PATH funds help individuals with SMI and co-occurring mental and substance use diso r\u00ad ders access needed services. PATH provide s technical support and fundin g for outreach, screening and diagnostic treatments, comm u\u00ad nity mental health services, alcohol and drug treatment, staff training, case management,health referrals, job training, and educational and housing services. There are approximately 600 local PAT H or\u00ad ganizations that work to engage behavioral health service agencies and housing programs.Nearly all States use money from PATH fo r\u00ad mula grants to contact and engage people whoare disconnected from mainstream resources. This includes collaboration with the Social Security Administration to support access to Social Security Income benefits among hom e\u00ad less populations with mental illness, as well as collaborative planning efforts with local co n\u00ad tinua of care to coordinate homelessness ser\u00advices and to end hom elessness. According to the PATH Web site (http://pathprogram.samhsa.gov /), PATH providers work with service delivery systems and use effective practices by: Partnering with Housing First and pe r\u00ad manent supportive housing programs. Providing flexible consumer -directed and recovery -oriented services. Improving access to Social Security and other benefits. Employing consumers or supporting consumer -run programs. Partnering with medical providers, inclu d\u00ad ing Health Care for the Homeless and community health centers, to integrate mental health and medical services. Improving access to employment. 16 Part 1, Chapter 1 Using technology, such as handheld elec\u00ad tronic devices, electronic records, and Homeless Management Information Systems (SAMHSA, n.d.; USICH , 2011) . Vignette 7 \u2014Sammy in Part 1, Chapter 2, of this TIP \u2014illustrates how PATH can be of assistance for clients with SMI who are home\u00adless. For more information about PATH, rela t\u00ad ed resources, and a list of PATH grantees, visitthe PATH Web site (http://pathprogram.samhsa.gov ). Homelessness and Behavioral Health Services Behavioral health problems are common among people who are homeless, and the risk of chronic homelessness increases when sub\u00adstance use or mental problems are present.Substantial progress toward recovery and self - sufficiency may require significant engagementefforts and repeated attempts at treatment andhousing rehabilitation. In addition, relapseduring substance abuse treatment may create barriers to a variety of services, including tra n\u00ad sitional and permanent supportive housing(Kertesz et al., 2007). Furthermore, clients who relapse and exhibit symptoms of theirmental disorder (e.g., a person with bipolarillness who relapses into a manic episode) may find their opportunities for housing restricted.People who are homeless or at risk for hom e\u00ad lessness and have a substance use or mental disorder are often cut off from social supports and need services ranging from safe and stable housing, food, and financial assistance to me d\u00ad ical care, mental health treatment, child care,education, skills development and other pr e\u00ad ventive services, employment, screening andearly intervention, and recovery support. It is important that y ou, as a behavioral health ser\u00ad vice provider, participate in a system of carethat responds specifically to your clients' wide - ranging needs. Comprehensive recovery efforts must include not only housing, but also sup\u00adportive mental health, substance abuse, med i\u00ad cal, occupational, and social services. The Special Rewards of Working With People Who Are Homeless As a behavioral health service provider, wor k\u00ad ing with individuals who are homeless may mean entering a world you have previously seen only from a distanc e. It is common to have concerns and anxieties when first begi n\u00ad ning to work with people who are homeless.In providing services for this population, you will likely face some complex and challengingproblems. At the same time, however, yourwork with people who are homeless can be quite rewarding; their gains can be dramatic asthey move through their personal recovery processes . For many, working with clients who exper i\u00ad ence homelessness provides the opportunity tolook inside a world that may be very differentfrom their own and to learn life histories that depart substantially from those of most people they know. Living on the streets requires sub\u00adstantial skill, strength, and resourcefulness.People who are homeless have lessons to teachabout being surviv ors in difficult and often hostile environments. Perhaps surprisingly, some people who are homeless are de facto experts on the service systems in their communities. These individ u\u00ad als have valuable first hand information about where to go (and not go) to seek food, shelter,medical services, and other resources. You cangather valuable information about community resources from these people. In working with this population, you have the opportunity to make a real difference for some of your community's mos t vulnerable and di s\u00ad enfranchised citizens: With your help, a person's immediate risk of harm can be substantially reduced. Assisting 17 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless your clients in obtaining even temporary housing will substantially reduce their risk of victimization, morbidity or mortalityfrom exposure, and exacerbation of mental illness. For clients with existing healthproblems, temporary housing can meanthe oppo rtunity to obtain needed medical care. You can help people realize elusive lifelonggoals. For many persons who are homeless, life in stable housing may feel like a di s\u00ad tant or unattainable dream. But this tra n\u00ad sition can be made , and you can be one of the change agents that makes it happen. See Vignette 1 in Chapter 2 (Juan). You can help people transform their lives. The difference between being homeless and b e\u00ad ing housed affects almost all aspects of a person's life, including increasing the lik e\u00ad lihood of advancing personal recovery from mental illness and substance abuse, as is the case with Ren\u00e9 in Vignette 5 inthe next chapter , and reducing the risk of future substance abuse and mental disor\u00adders, especially for children who are home\u00ad less (see Troy and Mikki in Vignettes 4 and 6 , Part 1, Chapter 2 , of this TIP ). You will come to understand, firsthand, one ofour Nation's pressing social problems. The Francises, Roxannes, and Mikkis of yourcommunity are not able to work forchange, at least not until they are further along in recovery. Working with them andactively helping them navigate and benefitfrom a layered service system is rewardingwork. Moreover, through your experiences and your understanding of their world, youcan help improve the behavioral health system that reduces homelessness and the hardships faced by people who are hom e\u00ad less. Counselor Competencies for Working With People Who Are Homeless The knowledge, skills, and attitudes for wor k\u00ad ing effectively with people who are homeless in all ph ases of rehabilitation are presented in this section (see also the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment's [CSAT 's] Technical Assi s\u00ad tance Publication 21, Addiction Counseling Competencies: The Knowledge, Skills, and Atti\u00adtudes of Professional Practice [CSAT, 2006a] for more information on counselor competencies).Some specific knowledge, skills, and attitudes helpful for your work with clients with a sub\u00adstance use disorder and/or mental illness andfacing or experiencing homelessness are listedbelow. All of the discussion below presumes that you, as a behavioral health service provid\u00ader, possess sufficient knowledge and skills andappropriate attitudes for working with people with mental illness and/or substance use di s\u00ad orders. Some competencies will be more rele\u00advant to either treatment or prevention workers.However , anyone who provides behavioral health services needs at least a basic level of competence in each area discussed in this sec\u00ad tion to ensure the delivery of integrated care and services to the whole p erson. Knowledge To provide effective services to people who are homeless or at risk of becoming so, behavioral health workers should possess knowledge of: Homelessness: its impact on people andfamilies, how it acts as a barrier to services for other pro blems, such as substance abuse and mental illness, and how, wit h\u00ad out intervention, it can become self - perpetuating. How substance abuse, mental illness, and homelessness interact to limit clients' o p\u00ad portunities for growth and change. 18 Part 1, Chapter 1 Medical co morbidity in homeless popula\u00ad tions and how to help people address physical wellness.

The interaction of co -occurring substance use and mental disorders and homeless\u00adness. Prevention and treatment methods that have been shown to be effective or promi s\u00ad ing with people with substance abuse and/or mental illness who are homeless. The fact that having a substance use di s\u00ad order or mental illness can itself affect the process of relationship development andtrust in others. Types of housing services that might be useful and how to access these services. Skills Using the following skills will allow behavioral health service providers to work more succes s\u00ad fully with clients who are experiencing home\u00adlessness or the threat of it : Use techniques for creating trusting, co l\u00ad laborative relationship s with members of a population that experiences high rates of social disaffiliation ; for identifying client strengths ; and for helping client s empower themselves to initiate and sustain stab le housing and recovery. Demonstrate specific outreach skills forpeople who are homeless, particularly those who are chronically homeless andhave a substance use and/or mental diso r\u00ad der. Conduct an initial screening and needs assessment for clients who present with asubstance use and/or mental disorder andare homeless or are facing homelessness. Recognize the effects of psychological trauma on trust, willingness to persevereand accept help from others, and a variety of other personal and interpersonal d y\u00ad namics that are important in treatment and recovery . Support clients' early changes (e.g., enter\u00ad ing treatment, recogn izing/ addressing mental and substance use disorders, fin d\u00ad ing temporary housing, obtaining neededmedical care, getting financial support). Develop person -centered treatment and/or prevention plans that consider the whole person and his/her individual needs, i n\u00ad cluding early intervention for emerging mental and substance abuse problems,mental illness and substance abuse trea t\u00ad ment and rehabilitation, and programming to build resiliency and enhance quality oflife by developing social and occupational skills. Use case management skills in helpingpeople make contact with and continue accessing needed community resources, i n\u00ad cluding preven tion programs. Retain clients in treatment and preventionprograms by maintaining rapport, motiv a\u00ad tion, and hope and by helping them work through the obstacles they face in recovery. Develop realistic, individualized relapse prevention and recovery managementplans that include specific \"how- to\" steps to follow if the client experiences a recur\u00adrence of behavioral health symptoms,homelessness, or other life problems. 19 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Collaborate with other service providers, family members, and social supports to: - Help peopl e who are homeless access services. - Better understand needs and strengths. - Ensure appropriate care and smoothtransitions. Attitudes Behavioral health workers engaged in provi d\u00ad ing services to clients who are dealing withhomelessness can benefit from certa in att i\u00ad tudes. For example: Accept and understand powerful emotio n\u00ad al responses to client behavior and address these responses in supervision. As a precondition to a positive workingrelationship, meet clients where they are rather than where they should b e. Appreciate that people must assume r e\u00ad sponsibility for their own recovery trajec\u00adtories, although they sometimes make choices that do not appear to be in theirown best interests. Trust that change begins with small steps that are self -reinforcing and agg regate to larger changes. Understand that all change is incremental and that many clients who are experien c\u00ad ing homelessness are on a long recovery pathway. Recognize that consistency and reliability can counteract the disaffiliation and mis\u00adtrust experienced by many persons who are homeless and have substance use or mental disorders. Appreciate that w ork with people who are homeless and in need of treatment r e\u00ad quires collaboration and cooperationamong a range of service professionals andpeer supports. Self-Assessment of Attitudes Toward People Who Are Homeless Attitudes toward homelessness, substance abuse, and mental illness vary widely. Many ofthese beliefs originate in childhood and influ\u00adence your perception of these problems. These perceptions, whether beneficial or limiting, tend to be reinforced as you encounter people dealing with substance use or mental disorders and homelessness. It is important for you to be particularly aware of your attitudes and beliefs regarding these topics. Likewise, it is i m\u00ad portant to remember that not everyone holds your particular views or attitudes. Behavioral health service providers work with people who are homeless and have a substance abuse or mental health diagnosis in many di f\u00ad ferent settings: street outreach, mobile crisisteams, drop -in centers, shelters, assertive community treatment (ACT) teams (see p . 143), permanent supportive housing programs, criminal justice environments, healthcare faci l\u00ad ities, and other community behavioral healthprevention and treatment pr ograms. This work presents many challenges along with opport u\u00ad nities for professional growth. One of the i m\u00ad portant challenges is to monitor and be aware of your personal attitudes and beliefs aboutyour clients. This section presents: Opportunities to consi der your reactions to and assumptions about people who are homeless. Myths people often believe about people experiencing homelessness. Methods for managing responses whenworking with this population. Reactions and assumptions about people who are homeless Three people with mental or substance use di s\u00ad orders who are homeless were described earlier in this chapter. Your reactions, assumptions, 20 Part 1, Chapter 1 and beliefs influence how you might interact with each one. After reading their descri p\u00ad tions, some of the reactions you might exper i\u00ad ence as you imagine a conversation withMikki, Roxanne, or Francis include: Empathy (I have an emotional under\u00adstanding of what it's like to be in his or her shoes). Sympathy (I feel sorry for him or her). Fault finding (Why doesn't he or she... like everyone else?). Curiosity (I wonder what his or her story is?). Aversion (I don't want to meet him or her). Fear (This person may hurt me in some way). Your personal experiences and history play animportant role in how you perceive and work with people who are homeless and have sub\u00ad stance use or mental disorders. Ask yourselfthe following: What is my personal and family exper i\u00ad ence with substance abuse, trauma, mental illness, and homelessness? What personal experiences do I have withthese problems , and how do those perso n\u00ad al experiences\u2014for better or worse \u2014affect my work? What is my emotional reaction to people who have a mental or substance use diso r\u00ad der and are homeless? How comfortable do I feel providing ser\u00advices to people with these problems, andwhat are the areas of discomfort that I e x\u00ad perience? What did I learn about homelessness, sub\u00ad stance use, and mental illness growing up? What beliefs and attitudes do I hold today that might challenge or limit my work with persons who are homeless and have a substance use or mental disorder? Myths and realities about people who are homeless When providers have insufficient information about social and health problems, myths may arise about the nature of the problems, the kinds of people who are likely to be affectedby them, and how the problems are best a d\u00ad dressed. Homelessness, and the relationshipbetween homelessness and behavioral health problems, are not exception s. Care providers are not exempt from the myths that universa l\u00ad ly abound. Your awar eness and management of attitudes and beliefs that may interfere withyour work will result in personal growth andbetter relationships with clients. Following are some common myths about people who are homeless. Myth #1. People choose to be homeless. Rea lity: Most people who are homeless want what most people want: to support themselves, have jobs, have attractive and safe housing, be healthy, and help their children do well inschool. Myth #2. Housing is a reward for abstinence and medication compliance , and society shouldn't house people who have active sub\u00ad stance use or mental disorders. Reality: Housing may be the first step to b e\u00ad coming abstinent and/or entering treatment to address a variety of problems. From a publichealth perspective, adequate housing reduces victimization, hypothermia or hyperthermia,infectious diseases, and other risks to the po p\u00ad ulation as a whole. Myth #3. People who are homeless are une m\u00ad ployed. Reality: Many people who are homeless are employed full or part time. According to data from the National Survey of Homeless Assi s\u00ad tance Providers and Clients (Burt et al., 1999), 44 percent of people who were homeless and 21 The Impact of Homelessness on Children and Families Homelessness results in a loss of community, routines, possessions, privacy, and security. Children, mothers, and families who live in shelters must make significant adjustments to shelter living and are faced with other problems, such as feeling ashamed of being homeless and accepting help, the a n\u00ad ger and confusion of being relocated, and having to adjust to a new school and other new routines. The stress related to these risks adds to the stress resulting from homelessness itself and can i m\u00ad pede recovery due to ongoing traumatic reminders and challenges: The experience of homelessness puts families at greater risk of additional traumatic experiences , such a s assault, witnessing violence, or abrupt separation. Children, parents, and families are stressed not only by the nature of shelter living and the need to reestablish a home , but also by interpersonal difficulties, mental and physical problems, and child -related difficulties such as illness. The stresses associated with homelessness can worsen other traum a-related difficulties and i n\u00ad terfere with recovery due to ongoing traumatic reminders and challenges. Children are especially affected by homelessness: Children who are homeless are sick twice as often as other children and suffer twice as many ear infections, four times the rate of asthma, and five times more diarrhea and stomach problems. Children who are homeless go hungry twice as often as children who have homes. More than one fifth of preschoolers who are homeless have emotional problems serious enough to require professional care; less than a third receive any treatment. Children who are homeless are twice as likely to repeat a grade as those with homes. Children who are homeless have twice the rate of learning disabilities and three times the rate o f emoti onal and behavioral problems compared with children who are not homeless . Half of school -age children who are homeless experience anxiety, depression, or withdrawal compared with 18 percent of children who are not homeless. A third of children over age 8 who are homeless have a major mental disorder. These are not only challenges in themselves, but also may act as \"secondary adversities,\" putting a child at greater risk for trauma reactions and making recovery difficult. For more information and a list of resources about providing care and improving access to services for children and families who have been traumatized and/or are homeless, visit the National Child Traumatic Stress Network Web site (http://www.NC TSNet.org ). Source: Bassuk & Friedman, 2005. Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless received services did some work for pay in the month before being surveyed. A single -day count of people who were homeless in an ur\u00adban area of Washington State found that 20percent were employed at least part time (Putnam , Shamseldin, Rumpf, Wertheimer, & Rio, 2007). Myth #4. There are few homeless families. Reality: T o describe the full impact of home\u00ad lessness, episodes of homelessness, and the ef\u00ad fects on children of tenuous living situations (such as the \" doubling up\" of one family in the ho me of another family), the National Center on Family Homelessness (NCFH) used r e\u00ad fined methods for estimating the number ofchildren exposed to these burdensome andstressful difficulties. NCFH determined that in 2010, 1.6 million children in America were exposed over the course of the year and 200,000 on any given night (NCFH, 2010). Myth #5 . People who are homeless aren't smart enough to make it. Reality: Keeping things together while home\u00ad less takes ingenuity and experience. People 22 Part 1, Chapter 1 who are homeless often have well -developed street skills, resourcefulness, and knowledge of the service system. Myth #6. Those with substance use or mental disorders need to \"bottom out,\" so homeless\u00ad ness is okay and provides a motivator to make behavioral changes. R eality: People who have substance us e and mental disorders are more responsive to inter\u00adventions before they become homeless orwhen placed in housing. Myth #7 . Everyone stands an equal risk of homelessness. Reality: Although any of us could find our\u00ad selves homeless in our lifetime, some peopl e are at higher risk than others. If we can ident i\u00ad fy people at special risk of homelessness, we may be able to intervene earlier and preventthe devastating effect s experienced by people who are homeless and have accompanyingmental and/or substance use di sorders. Myth #8. All clients with substance use and mental disorders who are homeless require extensive, long -term care. Reality: The process of recovery from sub\u00ad stance abuse and mental illness is an ongoingand sometimes lifelong process, yet healingoften begins with short -term, strategic inte r\u00ad ventions. Screening, brief intervention, andreferral to treatment (SBIRT; see the sectionon p. 35 for more information) is a proven method for early intervention with substance use and mental disorders, and it ca n signif i\u00ad cantly reduce the impact and progression ofillness. Self-Care for the Behavioral Health Service Worker The intensity of the work with people who are homeless and have mental and/or substance use disorders can lead to burnout, ethical d i\u00adlemmas, and a sense of being overwhelmed by your work. Your personal history is unique;however, commonalities of experience inworking with people who are homeless allow some generalizations about the need for self - care. Some of the actions you can take are co n\u00ad sistent across a variety of roles, personalities, and circumstances. Common responses to working with people who are homeless Working with people who are homeless may entail addressing emergency situations, co m\u00ad plex case management demands, severe andpersist ent symptoms, and refusal of services. The pace of the work may be a stressor, as some people who are homeless are reluctant toengage in services and require a lot of time and patience to develop trusting relationships.You may experience stress or unrealistic expec\u00adtations when working with this population.Other common reactions include: Considerable anxiety regarding clients indangerous situations (e.g., refusing shelteron frigid nights). A strong desire to repeatedly try to per\u00adsuade someone to go to treatment because you are concerned about his or her pace in recovery. Frustration and strong urges to use invo l\u00ad untary measures (e.g., police transport tothe hospital) despite no clear risk of immi\u00ad nent danger to self/others when a severely impaired person is slow to engage. Conflict over family members' reactions,given their experience (e.g., burnt bridges,extreme feelings of guilt) with an individ u\u00ad al's past behavior. Feeling overwhelmed or frightened by your client's irritability, anger, and frustr a\u00ad tion. An example of deescalating a person in the midst of an intense emotional rea c\u00ad tion is given in Vignette 3 (Roxanne, Part1, Chapter 2). 23 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Thinking about violating ethical bound a\u00ad ries or agency policies to meet the imm e\u00ad diate needs of a person who is homeles s (e.g., give them personal funds). Feelings of helplessness or a sense of guilt about a person's situation may add to the tempta\u00ad tion to violate boundaries and policies. A struggle to understand and appreciate the survival skills of a person who is hom e\u00ad less, particularly when his or her choices and behaviors (e.g., distrust, agitation)create barriers to receiving services. Guilt about going home at night while aclient is sleeping on the street. Anger or frustration about missed a p\u00ad pointments, which indicate resistance toengaging with services. Reluctance to continue providing services to someone whose priorities conflict withyour ideas about their needs (priority tofind drugs rather than adequate housing,resistance to obtaining medical care for an immediate problem). Frustration and feelings of ineffectiveness when your efforts to help seem to be un\u00adappreciated. A sense of disconnection from clients who seem demanding, needy, miserable, oroverwhelmed. Your own experiences also play a role in yourresponses to people who are homeless, andthese experiences may interfere with yourwork, particularly if: A member of your family has a substance use or mental disorder and/or has experi\u00adenced homelessness. You have trouble differentiating your own recovery process from that of your client. You have ever been homeless or faced with the prospect of being homeless. Y ou see yourself as someone who has overcome the odds and pulled yourself up \"by the bootstraps.\" It is difficult for you to work with people who are overtly angry, excessively passive,or insist ent about doing things their way. The experience of working with people who are homeless is new to you. Whether or not you have had these types ofpersonal experiences, you may struggle wi th your reactions when working with this popula\u00adtion, especially when dealing with stressful si t\u00ad uations. Managing responses to working with people who are homeless Managing your responses to feelings and stressors is easier if you develop and maintainsources of personal support (CSAT, 2006a): Learn to recognize when you need help(both technical and personal); ask for it. Work in teams and establish networks;discuss feelings and issues with teammates to lower stress and maintain objectivity. Be open and sensitive to differences of a t\u00ad titude or opinion among your colleagues regarding individuals who are homeless and the problems they face. When you find yourself being angry, crit i\u00ad cal, or dismissive toward the feelings orneeds of a person who is homeless, c onsid\u00ad er whether this is a sign of an attitude co n\u00ad flict, job burnout, or some other dynamicrelated to your work. Work closely with your supervisor and be open about any difficulties (for more i n\u00ad formation about the benefits and process of clinical supervisi on, refer to TIP 52 , Clinical Supervision and Professional Development of the Substance AbuseCounselor [CSAT, 2009b]). Managing feelings and stressors is easier if you maintain healthy boundaries between yourwork and personal life: Resist the urge to bring work home . 24 Don't spend your free time at work or with your clients. Resist the urge to be a friend or feel r e\u00ad sponsible for rescuing the people you serve from homelessness. Recognize that your role is to help people help themselves and enable them to a d\u00ad dress their life problems, not to take r e\u00ad sponsibility for their problems. Stages of Change, Recovery , and Rehabilitation This section presents several frameworks for helping people who are homeless by descri b\u00ad ing three important aspects of a trajectory out of homelessness: Stages of change (Prochaska, DiClemente,& Norcross, 1992). Th is transtheoretical model describes the process of behavioral change, beginning with precontemplationand continuing t hrough maintenance. It is often used to reflect the process of change for people with substance use disorders. Critical stages of recovery (Townsend, Boyd, Griffin, & Hicks, 2000). The crit i\u00ad cal stages of recovery model, often appliedto describe the change process with serious mental illness, emphasizes social and in\u00ad terpersonal connectedness and the rela\u00adtionship of the individual with systems that provide care. The model describes movement through four levels, from d e\u00ad pendence through interdependence. Stages of homelessness rehabilitation (McQuistion & Gillig, 2006). This model describes the logical progression of reh a\u00ad bilitation \u2014a process of moving intensive care and intoongoing reha bilitation. It describes the consequences of homelessness in a holisticmanner, recognizing that homelessness is not only the lack of adequate housing but Part 1, Chapter 1 also the psychological, emotional, occup a\u00ad tional, interpersonal, health, and other e f\u00ad fects on an indiv idual's or family's ability to function. Stages of Change Stages of change, which comprise the key o r\u00ad ganizing construct of the transtheoreticalmodel of change, inform effective interven\u00adtions to promote behavior change. Although they have traditionally bee n associated with substance misuse, they may also be applied to a person's experience in coming to grips withserious mental illness. The stages of change are equally applicable to prevention or treatmentinterventions, although in prevention, behaviorchange may involve risk or protective factors (e.g., parenting skills, physical inactivity) r a\u00ad ther than problem behavior per se. Most people cycle through the stages more than once, and movement through the stages can fluctuate back and forth ( Exhibit 1 -3). The stages are: Precontemplation \u2014Clients view behavior (e.g., substance use, psychological symp\u00adtoms, healthcare choices) as unproblematicand do not intend to change. Your focus Exhibit 1 -3: Stages of Chang e Source: Prochaska & DiClemente, 1986. Adapted with permission. 25 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless on changing behavior at this stage may al\u00ad ienate client s. Instead, appropriate i nter\u00ad ventions help client s engage in services and become ready to consider change. Contemplation \u2014Clients think about whether to change behavior , becom e aware of problems their behavior causes, and e x\u00ad perien ce ambivalence about their behavior. Preparation \u2014Clients decid e to make a change and have perhaps already begun to change problematic behavior. Action \u2014Clients make a clear commi t\u00ad ment to change; they engag e in activities as alternatives to problem behavior s, avoid high- risk situations, and develop relatio n\u00ad ships that reward their changed behavior. Maintenance \u2014Clients have sustained new behaviors for at least 6 months. They sus\u00ad tain and further incorporate changesachieved in the action stage and are activ e\u00ad ly working on supporting their recovery. Two other s tages of the transtheoretical model are sometimes identified: relapse and is a return to problem behaviors.Most relapses to substance use occur within 3 months of behavior change ; risk of relapse then begins to decline (Connors, Donov an, & DiClemente, 2001). Termination occurs whennew behaviors are thoroughly stabilized andthere is a compelling belief that a return to the proble m behavior is highly unlikely (s ee TIP 35, Enhancing Motivation for Change in Su b\u00ad stance Abuse Treatment [CSAT, 1999b] for an indepth discussion of stages of change ). Regardless of the model for understandingchange, it is important to remember that pe o\u00ad ple are often in different stages of change fordifferent issues. For example, a person may be willing to accept housing or medical care (preparation stage of the transtheoretical model) while not yet thinking about substance abuse or mental health treatment or broaden\u00ading coping skills or community involvement (precontemplation stage).The provider's cha l\u00ad lenge is to understand and respect the service recipient's stage of readiness and provide i n\u00ad terventions and services that facilitate forward movement. Skilled providers recognize thatreadiness to change some behaviors mightprovide an opportunity to explore ambival ence and enhance readiness to change others; forexample, persons may be willing to seek hous\u00ading but not immediately address substance use behavior. When they do recognize that hou s\u00ad ing issues are intertwined with substance use,they may be more willing to explore the pros and cons of their use. As people move toward the action stages in any model, they become ready for more i n\u00ad tense services, which often require more active collaboration with clients and may be offered in more structured housing and treatment orprevention programs where individual respo n\u00ad sibility for completion of tasks and behaviorchange yields successful outcomes. Critical Stages of Recovery Whereas the stages of change model addresses psychological readiness for behavioral change, the stages of recovery model addresses devel\u00ad opmental goals that are more closely related tomental health recovery, the degree and nature of social connectedness, and the relationshipbetween an individual and the service delivery system. As clients engage in their recovery process, they begin in a state marked by highdependence on the human services system andother community supports but are paradox i\u00ad cally unaware of that dependence. As they gain greater mastery over their recovery, they may remain dependent o n support from ot h\u00ad ers, yet become aware of that dependence. Fo l\u00ad lowing this is a stage of awareness and relative independence from these structures, and finally, a stage characterized by a sense of interdepend\u00ad ence, in which they are aware of challenges and can use natural support systems, both formal 26 Part 1, Chapter 1 and informal, realizing that they are also ac\u00ad tively contributing to the social envir onment. (Townsend et al., 2000 .) The stages of recovery model recognizes the right of people to live in the community and to choose their lifestyle. It is premised on anumber of additional guiding principles. Per\u00adhaps most important is that a client directs and manages his or her recovery process. Acorollary of that is that behavioral health se r\u00ad vice providers need to be wary of their tenden\u00adcy to encourage clients to be dependent on the treatment system (Townsend et al., 2000). As part of a community system of care, the be\u00ad havioral health service provider has an i m\u00ad portant role in each of the se stages to promote recovery (Exhibit 1 -4). Processes in recovery from substance use and mental disorders In recovery, people actively manage substance use and/or mental disorders and seek to tran s\u00ad cend these experiences as they build or reclaim meaningful lives in the community (Davidson Exhibit 1 -4: Behavioral Health Service Provider Roles and Best Practices According to Stage of Recovery Stage Service Provider's Role Best Practices To Facilitate Recovery Dependent/ Unaware Demonstrate hope Encourage self- acceptance Educate about behavioral health problems and the benefits of a recovery plan Engage family and other social supports Build relationship by listening, valuing , and accepting client as a worthwhile person Collaborate with client in managing behavioral health problems Build rapport with family/others L ink to services and benefits D ependent/ Aware Promote readiness to make choices about life roles/goals Educate family about available choices Offer support in designing a recovery plan Involve client with groups that a d\u00ad dress his or her specific needs Educate about behavioral health problems and relevant coping skills H elp with choosing goals I ndependent/Aware Help develop life roles/goals Encourage individual coping strategies to deal with symptoms and distressing experiences Support medication manag e\u00ad ment and use of recovery plan Encourage appropriate support from families and others Assist with connection to commun i\u00ad ty resources Work on recovery plan, recovery support, coping skills, and crisis plan I nterdependent/ Aware Work with client and support system to support life goals Help with community resources Review recovery plan regularly Support interdependence in community Support continuing recovery Advocate use of community resources Encourage involvement in comm u\u00ad nity activities Source: Townsend et al., 2000. 27 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless & White, 2007). The term \"recovery\" may have somewhat different meanings in sub\u00ad stance abuse treatment settings than it does inmental health settings. For instance, many cli\u00adents in substance abuse recovery may say they are never fully recovered from their illness and are \"only one drink away from a drunk,\" whereas individuals with a single major d e\u00ad pressive episode in their history may considerthemselves recovered, even \"cured\" of their il l\u00ad ness. In either case, it is import ant to know how each individual client understands these terms and how they apply to the recovery pr o\u00ad cess for the specific individual. Co nsidering the broader framework of reco v\u00ad ery\u2014integrating the recovery process from substance use disorders with that of mental disorders \u2014Davidson et al. (2008) obtained information from people in recovery abouttheir experiences. For most of the respondents,recovery meant taking an active role, pro\u00ad foundly changing the way they lived theirlives, opening up to new learning, and beco m\u00ad ing more flexible. The processes the authors describe are presented in Exhibit 1 -5. The a u\u00ad thors recognize that recovery is not linear , but they believe that processes represented toget h\u00ad er on a single line in the exhibit occur more or less simultaneously. This progression also su g\u00ad gests that some recovery strategies may be more useful at some points in the process thanothers. For example, early in recovery, a beha v\u00ad ioral health service provider might want to focus on strengthening mutual support sy s\u00ad tems and fostering a belief in recovery. These processes are also valid for clients enter\u00ad ing homelessness services from the criminal justice system. Developed in partnership wi th people in recovery, these processes reflect cha l\u00ad lenges people face in recovery and solutionsfor them . Y our role and that of the program administrator is to help articulate and thensupport clients' efforts in recovery by helpingthem identify acceptable strategies and r e\u00ad sources to confront these challenges. Prevention activities can play a central role in recovery, especially those that relate to skills Exhibit 1 -5: Substance Use and Mental Disorder Recovery Processe s Source: Davidson et al., 2008. Initiating recovery and assuming control Creating and maintaining mutual relationships Renewing hope, confidence, and commitment Understanding, accepting, and redefining self Becoming an empowered citizen Assuming control Overcoming stigma and promoting positive views of recovery Incorporating illness and maintaining recovery (including managing symptoms & triggers) Community involvement and finding a niche 28 Part 1, Chapter 1 development and wellness self -management. In addition, prevention programs c an adopt and benefit from a recovery orientation when working with individuals who are homeless. The process, dynamics, and important inter\u00ad ventions related to recovery are addressed indetail in the planned TIPs, Building Health, Wellness, and Quality of Life for Sustained Re\u00adcovery (SAMHSA, planned b ) and Recovery in Behavioral Health Services (SAMHSA,planned e ). Refer to these TIPs f or more i n\u00ad formation on supporting long -term recovery. Stages of Homelessness Rehabilitation Stages of homelessness rehabili tation refer to the different types of care a client with beha v\u00ad ioral health problems, and his or her family, may receive while moving toward housing st a\u00ad bility. Your work may involve clients at any ofthese stages. For individuals who are homeless,attainin g housing and financial stability are inextricably tied to other aspects of social sup\u00adport and to rehabilitation from disabling b e\u00ad havioral health conditions. Depending on theservices an individual who is homeless needs,stagewise interventions may emphasi ze ou t\u00ad reach and case management, screening andevaluation, crisis intervention, clinical preve n\u00ad tive services, preparation for treatment, trea t\u00ad ment planning, relapse prevention or recovery promotion, or ongoing counseling. Your existing skills in providing treatment and prevention services in behavioral health set\u00ad tings will be invaluable and can often translate directly into working with people with mental and/or substance use disorders who are home\u00adless. Nevertheless, you may need to developsome specific skills for work in this area. It will be necessary to coordinate your services withthose provided by staff in other homelessness programs and health and social service organ i\u00ad zations. Y our services and the services provi d\u00aded by other health and social service organiza\u00adtions are often delivered across stages, withservice transition points being particularly high-risk periods for dropout. The stages of homelessness rehabilitation are: Outreach and engagement. Transition to intensive care. Intensive care. Trans ition to ongoing rehabilitation. Ongoing rehabilitation. The amount of time a person spends in any of the stages of homelessness rehabilitation d e\u00ad pends on barriers to providing and acceptingservices \u2014such as availability of appropriate housing options, severity and chronicity ofsubstance use disorders and symptoms ofmental illness, and availability and acceptabil\u00ad ity of social supports for changing problematicbehaviors. Progress through the stages of r e\u00ad habilitation is not steady. Clients may dropout, re lapse in their substance use, and need outreach and reengagement several times b e\u00ad fore achieving ongoing homelessness rehabili\u00adtation. For this reason, this TIP assumes that motivation for changing problematic behav\u00adiors will fluctuate, that behavioral healthsymptoms may recur, and that a client may return to homelessness during any phase ofrehabilitation. Outreach and engagement Engagement is the first stage of work withpeople who are homeless (McQuistion, Felix,& Samuels, 2008). Its goal is to facilitat e the individual's movement through the early sta g\u00ad es of behavior change (Prochaska et al., 1992).Approaches during this phase include active outreach to prospective clients and engag e\u00ad ment services \u2014including capturing prospe c\u00ad tive clients' interest in a var iety of homelessness services, as well as substance abuse, medical, mental health, and social ser\u00advices; gaining the prospective client's trust; andincreasing motivation for change. For families 29 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless who are homeless, the prospect of preventive services for children may be especially attra c\u00ad tive. During this process, you should identify and attempt to meet basic needs for shelterand safety, and you should attend to immed i\u00ad ate health concerns. For some persons who are homeless or at risk for becoming so \u2014those com ing from criminal justice settings or those being discharged from treatment programs \u2014outreach may not be a particularly difficult issue, but engagement insocial, health, and continuing prevention andrecovery services may present more of a pro b\u00ad lem. Persons with transitional homelessness may not perceive the need for additional ser\u00advices beyond lodging, seeing their stay in ashelter or other homeless housing program unrealistically as a temporary transition to ge t\u00ad ting a place of their own. Additionally, clients recently in treatment for mental and substance use disorders may not recognize the effect oftheir impending homelessness on substance abuse and mental health recovery and across all other aspects of their lives. As a behavioral health worker, you can play an important role in outreach by acknowledginghomelessness as a significant element in whenand how people can access treatment, by rec\u00adognizing the needs of people who are home\u00adless for preventive and basic services, and by developing productive, trusting, and supportive relationships with people who are homeless and come to you for services. Transition to intensive care People enter the intensive care phase of home\u00adlessness rehabilitation when they agree to a c\u00ad cept health and/or financial benefits; medical,substance abuse, and/or mental illness treat\u00ad ment and prevention services; and, frequently,housing. This transitional phase is a high -risk period during which a large percentage of i n\u00ad dividuals drop out of ser vices. The transitional phase requires intensive support (e.g., inten\u00adsive case management, critical time interven\u00adtion) and your acceptance that some people may have increased ambivalence and may notattend program sessions or keep appointments or commitments. Essential elements in this phase include locating clients or program pa r\u00ad ticipants when they fail to make contact, ma k\u00ad ing phone calls, and providing im mediate tangible benefits (e.g., f ood, safe shelter, bus fare). Accordingly, you may have to adapt tr aditional assumptions about and approaches to service provision when a client is in the transitionalphase of homelessness rehabilitation (e.g., a s\u00ad suming clients will make and keep appoin t\u00ad ments; assuming program participants will attend sessions; assuming individuals have transportation to service settings; havingstandard time lengths for counseling, psy\u00adchoeducational, or anticipatory guidance se s\u00ad sions). You may need to exercise greaterpersistence and advocacy with these individ u\u00ad als. On the other hand, the skills you regularly use, such as maintaining a trusting and sup\u00adportive relationship, working with resistance,or adapting to specific needs or concerns canbe a significant benefit in working with ind i\u00ad viduals in this stage who are homeless. Intensive care As its name denotes, the primary focus of i n\u00ad tensive care is a comprehensive but carefully synchronized orchestration of homelessness rehabilitation, including treatment for mental and substance use disorders, access to benefits,active attention to med ical problems, housing access, and preventive services, such as assess\u00adment of and training in necessary skills (e.g.,money management, parenting , employment , and other life skills) . Cattan and Tilfor d (2006) suggest that for younger people whoare homeless, including young adults, mental health promotion activities that help create asense of community and empowerment may 30 be particularly important.Thus, prevention activities at this stage may include encoura g\u00ad ing participation in positive community activ i\u00ad ties (e.g., sports and the arts) and community service. Intensive care is implemented in a manner that emphasizes clients' participation in defi n\u00ad ing and managing their own goals. People inintensive care may drop out or return tohomelessness and need to be reengaged several times. In some cases, people verbalize this choice; in others, it is evidenced by angry ou t\u00ad bursts, disappearance from services, rule viola\u00adtions, or other behaviors. Appropriateresponses include respecting personal choices,attempting to reengage, welcoming the person back, and revising treatment and preventionplans when he or she returns. Some people inthis phase will accept higher intensity transi\u00adtional housing models combined with beha v\u00ad ioral health services as well as social and medi cal services. Others will only accept o p\u00ad tions that provide housing and voluntary pa r\u00ad ticipation in supportive services. It is important in the intensive care phase of homelessness rehabilitation to ensure that people maintain the gains they have made throu gh previous substance abuse and mental health services. Maintaining momentum forrecovery and relapse prevention, continued use of new skills, and involvement in community activities can be essential at this point. Stayingin touch with mental health, subs tance abuse, and other resources in the community is crit i\u00ad cal, even given transportation problems, em\u00ad ployment considerations, multiple pressingneeds, and financial constraints. This phase requires behavioral health services that are integrated with other ongoing hou s\u00ad ing, healthcare, legal, and social services. Close collaboration among all providers is a priority.The case management skills that treatment Part 1, Chapter 1 professionals use are highly applicable to serv\u00ad ing these clients. Transition from intensive care to ongoing rehabilitation Before individuals move into the ongoing homelessness rehabilitation phase (when they are preparing for optimal social reintegr ation), it is important to ensure that they have a co m\u00ad prehensive and evolving plan for sustainingthe proce ss of recovery, including acquisition of stable housing, gains made in social andother skills, and involvement in community activities. Successful plans also include a rea l\u00ad istic long -term plan for relapse and homeles s\u00ad ness prevention, development of strongconnections to social supports (e.g., family,faith, and recovery communities), stable i n\u00ad come and health benefits (e.g., job skills andemployment, health insurance, Federal disabi l\u00ad ity benefits, local government cash supports,veterans benefits, food stamps), and meanin g\u00ad ful daily activities that complement their r e\u00ad covery plans. Making the transition from intensive care to the open -ended stage of ongoing rehabilit a\u00ad tion takes time. Increased risk of dropout from services (including behavioral health services) because of increased ambivalence is common and can be addressed by providing increasedcase management services, staff attention, i n\u00ad centives to remain engaged (e.g., paid voc a\u00ad tional services contingent on abstinence andpositive work behaviors, transport ation), and increased relapse prevention efforts. Some people may attain such improved fun c\u00ad tioning, coping skills, social support, and f i\u00ad nancial resources that they can maintain independent, affordable housing with follow - up services to ensure their gains in recovery and other areas of functioning. Others may benefit from 1 to 2 years or more of a suppor t\u00ad ive recovery and housing environment (e.g., 31 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Oxford Houses) to develop better coping skills for maintaining recovery and improving socialfunctioning. Stil l others need weekly contact with a case manager from a multidisciplinary,community -based team to address any threats to housing stability and recovery as they arise.Transportation issues that limit participationin ongoing rehabilitation activities must also be addressed prior to exiting this phase. Behavioral health counseling and anticipatory collaborative problem -solving for clients in transition to ongoing rehabilitation are partic\u00adularly important. Helping clients stabilize inrecovery, engage and maintain attendance in self-help programs, develop a realistic indivi d\u00ad ualized relapse prevention/recovery promotionprogram, and begin to develop a healthy lif e\u00ad style are also important at this point. Ongoing rehabilitation Ongoing rehabilitation is an open -ended phase in which people gradually establish anidentity as no longer homeless (McQuistion etal., 2008). This stage includes an active andcontinuing supportive counseling relationshipand continued participation in preventionprograms as appropriate (e.g., regular follow - up meetings to address any problems related to housing stability and recovery). In this stage, clients have a contact person in case of acrisis or relapse. You can play a significant role as the program participant begins to depend less on services and service providers for assistance. Your co n\u00ad sistent, ongoing collaborative relationship withclients may be especially beneficial as theirself-concept, expectations for the future, self - esteem, and ability to manage life's problems evolve. Your support for the person's continued attendance at 12 -Step and other wellness self - management programs and involvement innew community activities is also helpful. You can be a role model for appropriate absinent behavior and help people share with others what they have learned in their transition from homelessness to an interdependent relatio n\u00ad ship with their environments. Clinical Interventions and Strategies for Serving People Who Are Homeless Behavioral health service providers working with people who experience homelessness need special skills. Specific knowledge abouthomelessness and its effect on recovery andchange is important, as is careful assessmentand modification of attitudes that affect yourwork wi th this population. Understanding the cultural context of clients and having the skills to adapt to a variety of cultures of people whoare homeless is very important. The skills you normally use in providing behavioral healthservices are applicable but may also need to be modified or honed to address the specificneeds of people experiencing or facing home\u00adlessness. It is beyond the scope of most behavioral health programs to meet many of the urgent needs of people who are homeless. Inevitably,this means that you \u2014who may be the point of contact or \"first door\" for a person who is homeless or facing homelessness \u2014must have a working knowledge of resources in the co m\u00ad munity for these people, not only for housingservices, but also for services that addressphysical health care, financial crises, criminal justice constraints, and dietary needs, among other concerns. Ideally, a behavioral health program will maintain reciprocal allianceswith other community resources that allow forefficient case management of persons withcomplex needs. A dditionally , people who are homeless may have special mental health and substance abuse treatment needs, including special tra u\u00ad ma-informed treatment services, specialized 32 Part 1, Chapter 1 care for co -occurring disorders, services to en\u00ad sure med ication management , and close med i\u00ad cal supervision while undergoing detoxification. If not already integrated into programming, treatment programs must include preventionprograms in their alliances , because many of these programs are designed to meet high - priority needs of persons and families who are homeless (e.g., skills development, parentingeducation, expanding recreational opportun i\u00ad ties, community involvement). Larger pr o\u00ad grams, especially treatment programs, may alsohave a designated case management staff member who coordinates referrals and ensures that clients follow through on referrals andthat services are provided. This TIP discusses seven activities common to many behavioral health service situations along with special adaptations that are us eful in working with people who are homeless: Outreach Initial screening and evaluation Early interventions and stabilization Treatment and prevention planning Case management Client retention and maintenance of co n\u00ad tinuity of care Relapse prevention and recovery manag e\u00ad ment Some of these areas may be more applicable tosome settings than others, but unless you work in a very specialized setting, all will probably be applicable to your current or future work. Outreach Outreach plays a crucial role in work with people who are experiencing homelessness. Itmeans making contact with individuals ontheir terms \u2014where they live\u2014rather than in an agency setting. It involves developing suff i\u00ad cient trust to help people consider receivingservices and the benefits the y might accrue from them. It may well mean developing ra p\u00ad port with people who, because of their exper i\u00ad ences, have no expectation of a positive outcome. Outreach is particularly relevant to the en\u00ad gagement stage of homelessness rehabilitation.It involves d eliberately and methodically cult i\u00ad vating a relationship with the person or family who is homeless. Effective outreach skills i n\u00ad clude: Expressing appreciation for survival skills as strengths and coping mechanisms. Understanding substance abuse and/orpsych ological symptoms from the client's perspective and understanding how those symptoms are interrelated. Addressing financial and health benefits aswell as food, healthcare, housing, and ot h\u00ad er immediate needs. Expressing optimism that together you can cre ate a plan that meets the person's needs. Empowering the client to set goals andcreate a plan for recovery and growth. You will probably find that outreach efforts with people experiencing homelessness are more aggressive and proactive than those you use in traditional mental health and substance abuse settings. You may find yourself meetingyour clients literally where they are rather thanwaiting for them to come to you. While takingcare to respect people's autonomy, you may be more assertive in engaging people into ser\u00advices. In treatment settings, you may be more assertive in establishing the therapeutic rel a\u00ad tionship. You may find yourself respondingmore actively to crises or becoming more i n\u00ad volved than you would with most treatmentclients or preventi on program participants. In effect, the skills of outreach are generic, buthow you apply those skills may be differentfrom your traditional role. 33 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Initial Screening and Evaluation This activity will generally be different for treatment and prevention prof essionals. Wit h\u00ad in prevention settings, a first contact with a person who is homeless may differ little from your first contact with other program partic i\u00ad pants. However, you will wish to pay special attention to constraints on participation(transportation, child care, etc.) and assist par\u00ad ticipants who are homeless in addressing these issues. Within your zone of comfort, you may also want to inquire as to other services thatyour program participant is receiving and su g\u00ad gest community resources where addition al services may be accessed. Within treatment settings, a first contact with a person who is homeless or facing homeless\u00adness will ordinarily involve initial observations and, potentially, decisions about care. For in\u00adstance, although a prospective client m ay not be forthcoming with information, it may fall to you to evaluate whether the individual is inimmediate danger with consequences tohealth or safety as a result of his or her life si t\u00ad uation . You might be in the position of having to determine whether the client needs imme\u00ad diate care as a result of drug use or mental ill\u00adness or to evaluate his or her ability to make decisions about care. Frequently, it will be ne c\u00ad essary to determine which other team mem\u00adbers or program staff persons might be helpful in determining urgent client needs (e.g., pr i\u00ad mary care provider, housing specialist, other mental health professional). People who are homeless typically engage gradually with services as trust is established.As opposed to techniques in more traditional settings (whether focused on treatment or pr e\u00ad vention), gathering information may take more time and be ongoing; new information may surface as the client stays connected. Tounderstand the client's level of functioningand identify appropriate services, sc reening and evaluation should gather informationabout: Substance use and/or mental disorders,including: - Evidence of a substance use disorder,which can include quantity and fr e\u00ad quency of use, compulsive use, craving,and problems related to drug use. - The effect of specific symptoms (e.g., paranoid thinking, undue grandiosity,constraints res ulting from depression) on a client's ability to seek and accepthelp with housing and other services. - Problematic substance use, symptoms of mental disorders, and client read i\u00ad ness for changing substance use beha v\u00ad iors and other areas of social functioning; specific screening instr u\u00ad ments can be used to determine each of these. - Screening for the presence of a diso r\u00ad der (positive screens should be referredfor further assess ment and formal d i\u00ad agnosis). - The possibility of co -occurring mental and substance use disorders and the implications of co -occurring disorders for immediate and extended treatment and recovery . Current and past exposure to trauma andrelated safety issues. Primary care records, history of medical conditions and hospitalizations, list of pr e\u00ad vious and current medications, and the current need for medical and dental care, including risk of and treatment for HIV/AIDS and other communicable di s\u00ad eases. Onset and course of homelessness and how it relates to the course of other symp\u00adtoms. Current skills and ability to maintain st a\u00ad ble housing. Current and/or pressing criminal justice issues, including outstanding warrants that 34 Part 1, Chapter 1 might lead to incarceration ; probation an d parole status; and current behaviors that, if discovered, might lead to arrest. Social functioning in terms of social sup\u00ad ports, literacy, education, job skills, em\u00adployment, and income, as well as: - The client's family (as he or she d e\u00ad fines it) and other social supports that the client wants to incorporate into theplan for recovery. - Immediate stressors (e.g., shelter living,housing instability, lack of money, debt,legal issues). Client interest in prevention -related a c\u00ad tivities, such as life skills development, stress and anger management, anticipatory guidance for youth, parenting programs,recreational or volunteer activities, and cultural enrichment programs. Having a directory of such prevention resources inyour community will be a useful adjunct toother service directories you use in yourwork. Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment SAMHSA has endorsed the use of SBIRT, which integrates initial screening with briefinterventions or referral to treatment in some settings with people who may have problems with substance use \u2014including clients with substance use disorders and co -occurring mental disorders. SBIRT is particularly useful with individuals who are homeless in that it requires relatively little time (roughly 5minutes to screen a patient and 10 minutes toprovide a brief intervention) and can preventthe need for further, more intensive services later on (Bernstein et al., 2009). In 2009, the National Institute on Drug Abuse released an Internet -based, interactive tool for s creening and brief intervention to address use of illicit substances. Research sup\u00adports the efficacy of SBIRT in reducing heavy use of alcohol and illicit drug use across arange of settings and clients. One evaluationof SAMHSA's SBIRT service program fou nd that SBIRT interventions had a positive i m\u00ad pact on homelessness as well, with significan t\u00ad ly fewer patients reporting lack of housing 6months after the intervention than had r e\u00ad ported it at baseline (Madras et al., 2009). SAMHSA's SBIRT model provides for early intervention and treatment services on a co n\u00ad tinuum of substance use. Beyond p roviding for substance abuse treatment, SBIRT also targets nondependent substance use problems andprovides effective strategies for early interven\u00adtion before the need develops for more exten\u00adsive or specialized treatment. See SAMHSA 's planned Technical Assistance Publication,Systems -Level Implementation of Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment , for more information (SAMHSA, planned g ). Early Interventions and Stabilization As behavioral health service providers further develop and maintain trusting relationship s, they engage in intensive early intervention andstabilization while addressing urgent enviro n\u00ad mental needs (such as health or c riminal ju s\u00ad tice issues) and managing acute substance abuse and mental health symptoms. In bothtreatment and prevention, this activity involvesconstructing a treatment and/or prevention plan that is person centered, adhering to an individual's goals. Some people who are home\u00ad less will need detoxification as part of a stab i\u00ad lization process. Others may need briefhospitalization to stabilize acute symptoms.Stabilizing is a process of beginning to restorephysical health and feelings of safety, to relieve emotional turmoil, and to get a sense of future goals and needs. Stabilization is a prerequisite for beginning an ongoing recovery program. Yet, for some peo\u00ad 35 How Does SBIRT W ork? Screening No or Low Risk Moderate Risk Moderate to High Risk Severe Risk, Dependence No Further Intervention Brief Treatment (on site or via referral) Referral to Specialty Treatment Brief Intervention Screening (S) is a process of identifying clients with possible substance abuse problems and deter\u00ad mining the appropriate course of future action for these individuals. The screening process does not identify exactly what kind of problem the person might have or how serious it might be; it simply determines whether a problem exists and, if so, whether further assessment is needed. Bri ef intervention (BI) is appropriate for clients identified through screening to be at moderate risk for subst ance use problems. BI can be provided through a single session or multiple sessions of m o\u00ad tivational interventions. These interventions focus on increasing a client's insight into and awareness about substance use and behavioral change. Brief treatment (BT), also called brief intensive intervention, is a specialty outpatient treatment m o\u00ad dality \u2014a systematic, focused process that relies on assessment, client engagement, and impleme n\u00ad tation of change strategies. The treatment consists of assessment and a limited number (typically 6 to 20) of evidence- based, highly focused, and structured clinical sessions (e.g., solution- focused therapy, cognitive- behavioral therapy). Clients may receive BT on site but more commonly are r e\u00ad ferred to an outside program or another component of a medical system. Clients identified as needing BT or more intensive treatment are referred to specialty substance abuse treatment ( referral to treatment [RT]), the primary goals of which are to identify an appropr i\u00ad ate treatment program and to facilitate the individual's engagement. RT requires a proactive, col\u00ad laborative effort between SBIRT providers and those providing specialty treatment to ensure that, once referred, the client accesses and engages in the appropriate level of care. Source: SAMHSA, planned g. Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless ple\u2014particularly those who have been living in ambiguity, chaos, or from crisis to crisis \u2014 stabilization can be uncomfortable. Some might describe their experience as \" waiting for the other shoe to drop.\" Others may have a well-developed ability to \" look good\" despite physical, emotional, interpersonal, and environmental instability. It is important for you to assess carefully the rate and extent to which a person has actually begun to stabilize; you must r esist the temptation to push ahead before stabilization is established. This accen\u00ad tuates how the activities o f stabilization may often challenge engagement, in that careful and active worker -client collaboration is r e\u00ad quired. 36 Part 1, Chapter 1 Treatment and Prevention Planning Treatment and prevention planning need s to be person -centered, addressing the client's goals and using ag reed-upon strategies. Pla n\u00ad ning should include decisions about: Which services the person needs andwants. Where the services will be provided. Who will share responsibility with the i n\u00ad dividual for monitoring progress. How services will be coordinated and r e\u00ad imbursed. Developing treatment and prevention plans for clients with complex needs is, at best, diff i\u00ad cult. Services have to be prioritized and plans made based on outcomes that have not yet been achieved. Both treatment and preventionare likely to involve multiple programs, eachwith its own goals and priorities, rules, andrestrictions, and with different levels of i n\u00ad volvement with the client or program partic i\u00ad pant. For instance, some services require aone-time visit (such as obtaining identification or screening for substance- related and mental health issues) , whereas others \u2014such as ma n\u00ad agement of chronic health conditions \u2014may be ongoing. Given this degree of complexity,treatment plans should include: Specific biopsychosocial goals relevant tothe indi vidual and his her living situ a\u00ad tion. Projected timeframes for accomplishingthese goals. Appropriate treatment and prevention a p\u00ad proaches. Housing and services the client will needduring service delivery. Follow -up activities during ongoing reh a\u00ad bilitation. Some services may have priority over others by virtue of immediacy of need or other co n\u00ad straints. For many people who are homeless, life stabilization and safe housing are requ i\u00ad sites for approaching and establishing recoveryfrom substance abuse or mental illness. For others, achieving some treatment goals (suchas abstinence) may diminish the intensity or importance of other problems . Most i m\u00ad portant, treatment and prevention planningneed s to consider the whole person and to pr i\u00ad oritize clients' immediate and longer -term goals. Planning should consider the enviro n\u00ad ment in which clients live, differentiate b e\u00ad tween the problems that can be resolved andthose that can only be lessened, and set prior i\u00ad ties for services. Case Management Case management, which is often assertive inthe beginning of care for people in homeless\u00adness rehabilitation, is essential in addressingclients' manifold needs and prevent ing clients from becoming lost in the maze of community services. The job of case management will generally fall to a counselor in a treatment agency, but there is no reason why a properly trained preventionist cannot serve as a case manager. Although most behavioral health counselors are well trained in case manag e\u00ad ment processes and techniques, clients who arehomeless have unique needs and may require assistance with such tasks as arranging tran s\u00ad portation, obtaining appropriate clothing forinterviews, ensuring refe r\u00ad rals, understanding the instructions providedby other agencies, and as sembling appropriate information and credentials needed by othercommunity programs. Particularly in work with people who are homeless, case manag e\u00ad ment services need to begin when the cliententers the service system so that needs are a n\u00ad ticipated, clients are not overwhelmed with numerous referrals at once, and you and yourclients have time to prepare for upcoming r e\u00ad ferrals. 37 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Preventive services using case management methods Although traditionally associated with health, mental health, or substance abuse tr eatment services, case management extends to preven\u00adtive services as well. Indeed, the same concerns that motivate case management in treatmentservices (e.g., matching services to need s, lo\u00ad cating appropriate providers, supporting pa r\u00ad ticipation in and compl iance with collaborative treatment planning, assistingwith logistics such as transportation and child care, monitoring attendance and progress) a p\u00ad ply as much to preventive services. The same person may serve as a treatment and prevention case manager, or the prevention case management function may be fulfilled by a prevention professional collaborating withthe treatment case manager. In either case, the goal is to integrate treatment and preventionservices to meet the unique needs and personal goals of the service recipient. This TIP emphasizes that people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness can ben e\u00ad fit from a variety of preventive services, esp e\u00ad cially clinical preventi ve services (i.e., selective and indicated prevention ; see Exhibit 1 -1). The T IP has discussed a variety of preventive services, including screening and brief or early intervention for emerging substance use ormental disorders , skill building (e.g., parenting skills, coping skills, anger management),strengthening families, relaxat ion training, e x\u00ad ercise, recreation programs, and community involvement. These are illustrated in Vignettes 4 (Troy) and 6 (Mikki) in Part 1, Chapter 2.Such services may be offered by local gover n\u00ad ments, schools and community colleges, free\u00adstanding preventi on agencies, social service agencies, primary care providers, organizationsthat serv e aging individuals , community cli n\u00ad ics, Boys & Girls fraternal organizations, congregations, co m\u00ad on. Not all comm u\u00ad nities offer all these services. Prevention case manager s should develop a comprehensive prevention directory for use in match ing client needs to available services. The principles and procedures presented in this chapter apply to prevention -related case management as much as to treatment -related case management. The only difference is thatthe prevention case manager will likely need toaccess a wider variety of community agencies to meet preventive service needs. Retaining Clients in Treatment and Maintai ning Continuity of Care For clients who have been living with chronic crises of housing, health care, drug use, crimi\u00adnal justice constraints, financial needs, andperhaps other issues, providing comprehensive,integrated care can seem an impossible task.As a result, it becomes important to keeptreatment and prevention goals realistic andachievable, relatively short term (although you and the client may have long -term goals in mind), and measurable. Specific strategies toimprove retention may be desirable, such as rewards for achieving and maintaining drugabstinence or consistent participation intreatment or prevention activities. Defining a process for the setting of goals can be beneficial. You should c ollaborate with cl i\u00ad ents to set goals in accorda nce with their prio r\u00ad ities. Targeted goal management will allow you to work with client s to assess current and evolving needs for financial benefits and health insurance; substance abuse, psychological, andmedical treatment and prevention services;housing resources ; access to transportation; employment and education; social supports;assistance with legal problems; and recreational activities. 38 Part 1, Chapter 1 As people identify their most important , press\u00ad ing goals, collaboratively identify one activity related to each go al area that: Is specific (e.g., number of weekly negative urine samples screened, groups attended,parenting sessions completed, volunteeropportunities identified, or job applic a\u00ad tions completed). Can be completed successfully in a giventimeframe. Can be verified objectively via receipts, agency reports, worksheets, or the like. Is tailored to the client's individual level of psychosocial functioning and personal andsocial resources to increase the likelihood of successful completion. Small successes and progress toward persona l\u00ad ly meaningful goals while maintaining ac\u00adcountability and autonomy build client self - esteem and confidence. Y our relationship withthe people you serve is strengthened throughcollaborative decisionmaking about activitiesto be acc omplished and reinforcing the ind i\u00ad vidual's completion of activities. In traditionaltreatment programs, reinforcement for co m\u00ad pleting activities includes social recognitionand sponsor status in mutual support groups,take-home privileges, early dosing wind ows in methadone maintenance programs, andvouchers for self -care items and food. In pr e\u00ad vention programs, reinforcement may take the form of social recognition, opportunities fortraining, or attendance at conferences. Relapse Prevention and Recovery Management Clients with mental illnesses, substance use disorders, cognitive impairment, and/or family histories of substance use and mental disorders are at higher risk for relapse and subsequentloss of housing (see the planned TIP , Recovery in Behavioral Hea lth Services [SAMHSA, planned e ]). As individuals move into the cli n\u00ad ical stage of ongoing rehabilitation, a variety of evidence -based and best practices interven\u00ad tions are available to support personal reco v\u00ad ery, including relapse prevention and wellness self-management. Wellness self -management, also termed illness self-management, is a manualized, evidence - based, time -limited group technique that helps teach skills of maintaining and enhancinghealth and we llness (Mueser et al. , 2006). I n\u00ad terventions are typically delivered through aseries of classroomlike group sessions thatcapitalize on cognitive -behavioral techniques, each focusing on a wellness topic, such as medication complianc e, diet, or stress ma n\u00ad agement. Simultaneously, mental health and substance use issues undergo continuingtreatment, along with housing supports. Su p\u00ad portive housing that accepts and addresses r e\u00ad lapse or recurrence of psychiatric symptoms aids this. Coping skills training, employmen t and educational assistance, and the encou r\u00ad agement of establishing social connectedness through participating in other community i n\u00ad stitutions (e.g., faith -based organizations, sen\u00ad ior centers, community volunteer groups , recreation al groups), as well as recovering fa m\u00ad ily ties, help maintain the personal recovery process (Marlatt & Donovan, 2005). Evidence -Based Practices in Homelessness Rehabilitation Exhibit 1 -6 presents promising and evidence - based practices that support people who are homeless while th ey move through the stages of rehabilitation and establish stable housingand long -term recovery. You may already use these practices in the behavioral health trea t\u00ad ment settings in which you work. Several evidence- based practices have been evaluated specifically with homeless popula\u00ad tions, including ACT , critical time intervention (CTI), motivational interviewing (MI), contin\u00adgency management, cognitive -behavioral 39 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Exhibit 1 -6: Promising and Evidence -Based Pr actices by Rehabilitation Stage Treatment Approach Engagement Transition Intensive Care Transition Ongoing Rehabilitation Incentives (food, transportation, benefits) X X X X Primary medical care X X X X X Motivational interviewing X X X X X Clinical preve n\u00ad tive se r\u00ad vices Indicated (e.g., screening, brief intervention) X X X X Selective (e.g., skills deve l\u00ad opment, anger manag e\u00ad ment, anticipatory guidance, parenting pr o\u00ad grams) X X X X Universal prevention pr o\u00ad grams (e.g., workplace programs, recreation pro\u00ad grams, volunteerism) X X X X X Integrate d treatment for CODs X X X X X Peer support X X X X X Family and social support X X X X X Intensive case management X X X X Critical time intervention X X Contingency management X X X Assertive community treatment X X X Illness self -management X X Medication X X X X Cognitive -behavioral interventions X X X Relapse prevention X X X Supportive housing X X X X X Supportive employment (e.g., the International Center for Clubhouse Development model) X X interventions , supportive housing, and sup\u00ad portive employment. ACT is a widely used treatment met hod adapted from services for people with chronic mental illness for work with people who are homelessness. Numerous studies (e.g., King et al., 2009; N elson, Aubry, & Lafrance, 2007) have shown that the i n\u00ad tensive services provided by ACT teams i n\u00ad crease treatment adherence, reduce days ofhospitalization, and increase housing stability.Teams composed of mental health professio n\u00ad als provide a wide variety of services, includingcase management, mental health services, cr i\u00ad sis intervention, treatment, education, andemployment support. ACT services are availa\u00adble around the clock to respond to the client's immediate needs. ACT has been widely i m\u00ad plement ed in a number of countries, including the United States. For m ore information on ACT , visit the ACT Association Web site (http://www.actassociation.org ). CTI is a time -limited adaptation of intensive case management to bring problem -solving resources, community advocacy, and motiv a\u00ad tional enhancement to clients who are home\u00adless. It is particularly useful in work withclients who are in transition, such as those en\u00adtering homeless shelters from prison, and inthe development of continuity of care for 40 Part 1, Chapter 1 people with COD s who are leaving shelters for other community housing resources (Draine & Herman, 2007; Herman, Conover,Felix, Nakagawa, & Mil ls, 2007; Jones et al., 2003). New York Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University (2011) developed The Critical Time Intervention Training Manual , which describes the phases of the 9 -month program of care in CTI as follows : Phase One\u2014Transition to Community. A treatment plan is made; clients are linked to appropriate community resources. Phase Two \u2014Try Out. Linkages in the system are tested; the treatment plan is formalized, adjusted, and implemented. Phase Three \u2014Transfer of Care . Long\u00ad term community linkages are monitoredand long -term goals are established ; work toward them is begun . Contingency management uses tangible r e\u00ad wards for housing, work training, and workopportunities and can provide direct monetary reinforcement (e.g., gift cards ) for accomplis h\u00ad ing clearly defined weekly rehabilitation goals.Thes e procedures have been studied intensiv e\u00ad ly in a community setting in Birmingham, AL, in a series of four randomized, controlled trials that showed significant improvement in sus\u00adtained abstinence, housing stability, and stableemployment (Milby et al., 1996 , 2000, 2005, 2008). Cognitive -behavioral interventions have shown clear treatment advantage s and su s\u00ad tained superior outcomes for abstinence from 6 to 12 months and from 12 to 18 months af\u00ad ter follow -up compared with contingency management alone in a delay ed treatment e f\u00ad fect. Additional cognitive -behavioral interve n\u00ad tions were and compared withcontingency management alone (Milby et al.,2008). MI is a client engagement, motivational en\u00ad hancement, and counseling process that has been widely used in mental health and sub\u00adstance abuse treatment settings and has beenadapted for the needs of clients in homeles s\u00ad ness rehabilitation. It is particularly efficacious in work with clients who are homeless, abuse substances, and are entering sober housing(Fisk, Sells, & Rowe, 2007). Many standard MI techniques and protocols for enhancingcommitment to treatment and reducing r e\u00ad sistance are applicable to clients experiencinghomelessness. For more information on MI protocols, see TIP 35 (CSAT, 1999b). Supportive ho using can improve sustained a b\u00ad stinence, stable housing, and employment (Milby, Schumacher, Wallace, Freedman, &Vuchinich, 2005), and it can greatly improvehousing stability for clients with serious men\u00adtal illness who are homeless (Tsemberis, Gul\u00adcur, & Na kae, 2004). Supportive employment assists clients in a c\u00ad cessing, obtaining, and maintaining emplo y\u00ad ment as a primary method to prevent or endhomelessness. Recognizing work as a priority in preventing or ending homelessness, Sh a\u00ad heen and Rio (2007) note that early treatment and rehabilitation efforts often focus more on housing and supportive services and highlightthe value of assisting clients in obtaining em\u00adployment and/or education early in rehabilit a\u00ad tion. They suggest that employment helps clients who are experiencing homelessness d e\u00ad velop trust, motivation, and hope. Supportive employment not only help s people find jobs; it also helps them achieve continu ed emplo y\u00ad ment by teaching them skills such as problem - solving, managing interpersonal conflicts, d e\u00ad veloping appropriate work -related behaviors, and managing money wisely . Your knowledge and skills in working withclients who have mental and substance use disorders may be particularly important inhelping them maintain abstinence , regulate symptoms, maintain motivation, and 41 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless strengthen the interpersonal skills that are necessary to maintain employment and pursue education. Many individuals who have notbeen employed for months or years \u2014clients who are just leaving prison or are chronically mentally ill \u2014may first need a supervised work environment to develop or improve these skills. The VA hospital system has used a var i\u00ad ation of supportive employment called ind i\u00ad vidual placement and support (IPS). IPSfocuses on rapid placement in jobs of the cli\u00adents' choosing, competitive employment, o n\u00ad going and time -unlimited support, integrated vocational assistance and clinical care, andopenness to all who want to work, regardless of clinical status or work experience (Rose n\u00ad heck & Mares, 2007). There are dozens of universal, selective, and indicated evidence -based prevention programs applicable to populations of people who are homeless, but few have been specifically tested with these populations. SAMHS A's National Registry of Evidence -Based Programs and Practices ( NREPP ) lists two evidence -based prevention programs for youth that address substance abuse and mental health outcomes. The Curriculum -Based Support Group (CBSG) Program (Arocena, 2006) is a su p\u00ad port group intervention designed to increase resiliency and reduce risk factors among chi l\u00ad dren and youth ages 4 throug h 15 who are identified by school counselors and faculty as being at elevated risk for early substance use and future delinquency and violence (e.g., they are living in adverse family situations , displa y\u00ad ing observable gaps in coping and social skills,or displaying early indicators of antisocial att i\u00ad tudes and behaviors). Based on cognitive - behavioral and competence- enhancement models of prevention, the CBSG Program teaches essential life skills and offers emotio n\u00ad al support to help children and youth cope with difficult family situations; resist peer pressure; set and achieve goals; refuse alcohol,tobacco, and drugs; and reduce antisocial att i\u00ad tudes and rebellious behavior. Lions Quest Skills for Adolescence is a mult i\u00ad component, comprehensive life skills educ a\u00ad tion program designed for schoolwide and classroom implementation in grades 6 through8 (ages 10-14). The goal s of the Lions Quest program are to help young people develop positive commitments to their families, schools, peers, and communities and to en\u00adcourage healthy, drug -free lives. (See SAMHSA's NREPP for further information at http://nrepp.samhsa.gov.) Say it Straight ( Englander -Golden et al., 1996) is a communication training program that helps students and adults develop em\u00ad powering communication skills and behaviors and increase self -awareness, self -efficacy, and personal and social responsibility. In turn, the program reduce s risky or destruct ive behaviors (e.g., substance use, eating disorders, bullying, violence, precocious sexual behavior, behaviors that can result in HIV infection ). One area of mental health promotion/mental illness prevention that has been addressed in some literature is suicide prevention. People who are homeless have high rates of suicida l ideation and suicide attempts. Childhoodhomelessness, being homeless for 6 months ormore, and substance use disorders in adults ages 55 and older are all associated with grea t\u00ad er rates of suicida lity (Prigerson, Desai, Mares, & Rosenheck, 2003). More information on suicide prevention for clients in substance abuse treatment can be found in TIP 50,Addressing Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors inSubstance Abuse Treatment (CSAT, 2009a). Additionally, a variety of evidence -based pra c\u00ad tices noted in NREPP , although not tested specifically with populations of people who are homeless, have significant implications for 42 The Clubhouse Model of Transitional Employment NREPP lists the International Center for Clubhouse Development's (ICCD's) clubhouse m odel as an evidence- based program. A clubhouse is a day program, often run at a community center, that s up\u00ad ports people recovering from mental illness by helping them rejoin the job force and fostering stronger friendships, family relationships, and educational aspirations. Clubhouses are built on: A work -ordered day. The daily activity of a clubhouse is organized around a structured system known as the work -ordered day. Th e work -ordered day includes an 8-hour period that parallels typical business hours. During this period, members and staff work together to perform i m\u00ad portant tasks in their communities. There are no clinical therapies or treatment -oriented pro\u00ad grams in the c lubhouse; members volunteer to participate as they feel ready and according to their individual interests. Employment programs. Clubhouses provide members with opportunities to return to paid e m\u00ad ployment in integrated work settings. These opportunities include transitional employment \u2014a highly structured means for gaining work in local business and industry. Members receive part - time placements (15 -20 hours per week) along with onsite and offsite support from clubhouse staff and members. Placements generally last 6 to 9 months, after which members can seek a n\u00ad other transitional placement or move on to independent employment. Transitional employment allows mentally ill individuals to gain the skills and confidence necessary for employment while they hold a real-world job. Evening, weekend, and holiday activities. Clubhouses provide both structured and unstructured social/recreational programming outside the work -ordered day. Community support. People with mental illness often require a variety of social and med ical se r\u00ad vices. Through the work -ordered day, members receive help accessing the best quality services in their community, acquiring and keeping affordable and dignified housing, receiving psychia t\u00ad ric and medical services, getting government disability bene fits, and so forth . Outreach. Clubhouse staff maintain contact with all active members. If a member is hospitalized or does not attend the clubhouse, a telephone call or visit serves to remind that member that he or she is missed, welcomed, and needed at the clubhouse. Education. Clubhouses offer educational opportunities for members to complete or start certifi\u00ad cate and degree programs at academic and adult education institutions. Members and staff also provide educational opportunities within the clubhouse, particularly in areas related to literacy. Housing. A clubhouse helps members access safe, decent, dignified housing. If there is none available, the clubhouse seeks funding and creates its own housing program. Decisionmaking and governance. Members and staff meet in open forums to discuss policy i s\u00ad sues and future planning. An independent board oversees management, fundraising, public rel a\u00ad tions, and the development of employment opportunities for members. The ICCD Web site ( http://iccd.org/) offers a directory of clubhouses and more information on this transitional em ployment model. TIP 38, Integrating Substance Abuse Treatment and Vocational Ser\u00ad vices , covers employment services and can help you select employment support models suitable for clients who are homeless and have behavioral health issues (CSAT, 2000a). SAMHSA's Supported Employment Evidence -Based Practices (EBP) KIT (SAMHSA, 2009) provides p ractice principles for supported employment, an approach to vocational rehabilitation for people with s erious mental illness. It promotes the belief that everyone with SMI is capable of working competitively in the community. The KIT is available for free at SAMHSA's Publications Ordering Web page (http:// store.samhsa.gov ). Source: International Center for Clubhouse Development, 2009. Adapted with permission.

Part 1, Chapter 1 43 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless work with this population. Three ex amples of tested programs for trauma treatment include Seeking Safety, Trauma Recovery and E m\u00ad powerment Model (TREM), and a Boston ConsortiumModel: Tr auma -Informed Substance Abuse Treatment for Women. All of these programsuse cognitive -behavioral and psychoeduc a\u00ad tional methods to teach problem -solving, co p\u00ad ing skills, and affect regulation strategies to individuals who have experienced significanttrauma. A program that is particular ly relevant to people who are homeless and have co - occurr ing substance use and mental disorders is Modified Therapeutic Community for Per\u00ad sons With Co -Occurring Disorders, a long \u00ad term residential program with the structur e and processes of a traditional therapeuticcommunity but with adaptations for individ u\u00ad als with co -occurring disorders. The program can be flexibly applied in both correctional and community settings and includes comp o\u00ad nents on mental health and substance abuse treatment. For m ore information on these and other evidence -based programs, refer to the NREPP Web site ( http://nrepp.samhsa.gov/ ). Special Issues in Service Delivery People with substance use and/or mental di s\u00ad orders who are homeless have a variety of sp e\u00ad cific needs and considerations in treatment and prevention programs.These needs tend tofall into three major categories: Specific client needs Family services to reduce the risk of inter\u00adgenerational problem s Cultural competence Specific Client Needs needs are not met. It is also much more diff i\u00ad cult for individuals with substance use and mental disorders to manage their symptoms when these basic needs are not met. Some of the most pressing issues of people who are homeless include: Addressing acute and chronic medicalconditions (e.g., diabetes, HIV infection,heart and respiratory conditions, and thelike, as well a s drug detoxification and medical stabilization of mental illnesses). Having u ntreated or inadequately treated disabilities, such as hearing and/or visionimpairment, lack of balance, or mobility impairments. Recogniz ing c ognitive problems, such as memory deficits, poor attention, and co n\u00ad centration. Making the transition from jail or prisonto the \"free world,\" which includes adap t\u00ad ing survival skills that were functional inprison but are counterproductive outside the criminal justice system. Making the transition from inpatient ho s\u00ad pitalization, where people are free from r e\u00ad sponsibility for their care , to having to assume full accountability for their care and their behavior. Dealing with a history of trauma whensudden or unexpected events may trigger flashbacks or other responses that are per\u00adceived as inappropriate and when symp\u00ad toms of psychological trauma mimic,exaggerate, or obscure the symptoms of other mental and substance use disorders. Family Services T o Reduce the Risk of Intergenerational Problems Integration of prevention and treatment ser\u00ad vices for families who are homeless is critical. It is unrealistic to expect that people who are Family programs involving parents and their experiencing homelessness will be able to children have been a mainstay of universal, maintain housing if their social and health select ive, and indicated prevention p rograms 44 Part 1, Chapter 1 for at least 3 decades. Examples include parent participation (e.g., homework assignments) inschool -based programs (universal), home -visit programs for high -risk families (select ive), and intensive parent -child interventions when one or both paren ts are undergoing substance abuse treatment (indicated). All of these pr o\u00ad grams \u2014particularly those categorized as ind i\u00ad cated \u2014are appropriate for families who are homeless in which the parents receive sub\u00ad stance abuse or mental illness treatment. NREPP ( http://nrepp.samhsa.gov ) lists over 50 family programs that may be relevant to working with families who are homeless. Afew examples include: The Strengthening Families Program:This is a family skills training program d e\u00ad signed to increase resilience and reduce risk factors for behavioral, emotional, ac a\u00ad demic, and social problems in children 3 - 16 years old. The Strengthening Families Program forParents and Youth 10 -14: This family skills training intervention is desi gned to enhance school success and reduce youthsubstance use and aggression among 10 \u00ad to 14- year-olds. The Clinician -Based Cognitive Ps y\u00ad choeducational Intervention: Intended for families with parents who have a signif i\u00ad cant mood disorder, this intervention is designed to provide information aboutmood disorders to parents, equip them with skills they need to communicate this information to their children, and open a dialog in families about the effects of p a\u00ad rental depression. DARE To Be You: This multilevel pr e\u00ad vention program is intended for high -risk families with children 2 -5 years old. Pr o\u00ad gram objectives focus on children 's devel\u00ad opmental attainments and aspects ofparenting that contribute to youth resil i\u00ad ence to later substance abuse, including parental s elf-efficacy, effective child rea r\u00ad ing, social support, and problem -solving skills. Familias Unidas: A family -based interven\u00ad tion for Hispanic families with childrenages 12 to 17. The program is designed to prevent conduct disorders; use of illicitdrugs, a lcohol, and cigarettes; and risky sexual behaviors by improving family fun c\u00ad tioning. Cultural Competence Race, ethnicity, and culture influence how people express problems, seek help, and acceptservices. Your cultural background and that ofyour clients can influence how you presentservices and how acceptable they are to clients . Staff members should reflect the diversity of the population, work in teams that incorporate diversity, and engage in team discussions aboutthe influence of cultural factors on engag e\u00ad ment and retention, risk and protective factors,and resiliency (Rowe, Hoge, & Fisk, 1996). It may be important to include service providers on your team who have experienced home\u00adlessness themselves and understand that homelessness itself can be part of a subculture with its own expectations, behaviors , and pa t\u00ad terns of communication ; understanding this culture is essential to effective work with ind i\u00ad viduals and families who are homeless. Culturally competent service providers under\u00ad stand that people som etimes reject services because of cultural norms and/or past negative experiences with the service system. For ex\u00adample, your organization may find that manyclients who are at risk of homelessness live with family members who will not come toyour organiza tion for services. A culturally r e\u00ad sponsive service strategy may involve a service provider of the same cultural backgroundproviding services where the client lives. You can act as a consultant, offering psychoeduc a\u00ad tion and skills development to address 45 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless individuals ' issues in a manner that is accept a\u00ad ble to them (Connery & Brekke, 1999). Culturally competent counselors are also mindful of the client's linguistic requirements and the availability of interpreters. You should be flexible in designing a treatmen t plan to meet client needs, and, when appropriate, you should draw upon the institutions and r e\u00ad sources of your client's cultural community. Treatment providers need to plan for the pr o\u00ad vision of linguistically appropriate services b e\u00ad ginning with actively recruiting bicultural and bilingual clinical staff, establishing translationservices and contracts, and developing trea t\u00ad ment materials prior to client contact. Even though you cannot anticipate the language needs of all potential clients, you can develop a list of available resources and program proc e\u00ad dures that can be followed when language needs fall outside the treatment program's ty p\u00ad ical client demographics. Women often have unique experiences and challenges different from the male majorities usually found in substance abuse treatment.They often find or take few opportunities totalk in male -dominated groups about physical or sexual abuse perpetrated by the men in their li ves, perceived barriers to restoring child custody, and other women's issues. Absence of opportunit ies to discuss gender -related pro b\u00ad lems usually precludes the development of acomprehensive rehabilitation plan to address them (CSAT, 2009d). People who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgendered may face different barriers toservices. People who are transgendered may need special consideration of options and a d\u00ad vocacy prior to placement in shelters, trea t\u00ad ment centers, prevention programs, andhousing. For more information on culturally competent behavioral health treatment, see the pl anned TIPs, Improving Cultural Competence (SAMHSA, planned c ) and Behavioral Health Services for American Indians and Alaska N a\u00ad tives (SAMHSA, planned a ), as well as A Pr o\u00ad vider's Introduction to Substance Abuse Treatment for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, andTran sgender Individuals (CSAT, 2001). Community Housing Services for People Who Are Homeless Unless you work in a setting specifically d e\u00ad signed to serve people who are homeless, you are probably not acquainted with the variety ofhomelessness services available in your co m\u00ad munity. Services can vary widely from one community to another based on community needs and program goals. You may also not be aware of abstinence or other specific requir e\u00ad ments among different program and housingoptions. Housing services also exist for special populations that might be important in yourwork, such as veterans or people who live inrural areas. Additionally, the services clients need will vary by the type of homelessness they are experiencing. In general, housing services can be divided into four main categories. Emergency shelters provide brief -stay, ove r\u00ad night accommodation to people who have no safe place to stay for a short period of time.Often , people cannot enter the shelter until the late afternoon and must leave by a specific time the next morning. Most allow for storage of personal possessions during the day while the individual has to be out of the shelter;some require that all possessions be taken by the occupant when they leave each day. Mostshelters offer assista nce with food and other emergency needs, but given their short -term focus, do not provide ongoing services for res\u00adidents. 46 Part 1, Chapter 1 Temporary housing can be provided in a var i\u00ad ety of settings, including shelter settings (such as a shelter specifically for persons affected by domestic violence), multiple- occupancy dwel l\u00ad ings, hotels and single- room occupancy ) settings, small clustered apartments, or apar t\u00ad ments in the community.Temporary housingis often a resource for families and individuals in crisis who need immediate housing helpand assistance with social service, health, men\u00ad tal health, substance use, financial, le\u00adgal/criminal justice, and other needs.Temporary housing services typically provideoutreach and engagement, case management,referral, and follow -up services to mitigate or resolve crises. Temporary housing services are generally limited to 2 or 3 months' duration. After stabilization, individuals and familiesmay move to either transitional or permanentsupportive housing. Transitional housing is useful for individuals who have no permanent place to live and are making a transition from a location wherethey have been temporarily housed (temporary housing, a substance abuse or mental health treatment facility, a criminal justice setting , etc.) to housing that supports their transition to a more permanent setting. Transitional housing is normally provided for periods of afew months to 2 or 3 years and is accompaniedby a variety of resources (social services, healthcare, employment assistance, mental healthand substance abuse treatment, case manag e\u00ad ment, and other services).The use of transi\u00adtional housing supports for people who have been in substance abuse and/or mental healthtreatmen t to smooth ree ntry into the comm u\u00ad nity is discussed in Part 1, Chapter 2, of this TIP (see the vignette about Sammy) . Trans i\u00ad tional housing and accompanying supportiveservices are funded by a variety of resources. Permanent supportive housing combines a long-term commitment to affordable housing with supportive services to allow individuals and families to live more productive and stable lives; it is a primary thrust of SAMHSA 's (along with other Federal agencies') efforts to address the needs of people with disabilities.Typically, permanent supportive housing pr o\u00ad vides homes for individuals and families who otherwise would be living with the constantthreat of homelessness and would lack the supportive social and health services (such as primary health car e, mental health treatment , employment, and economic and other r e\u00ad sources) necessary to adequately cope in the community. There are no requirements that individuals in permanent supportive housingobtain mental health or substance abuse treatment, and there are no requirements about abstinence from alcohol and/or drugs as a condition for participation in the program.Supportive housing can, however, be coupledwith such social services as job training, life skills training, and alcohol, drug abuse, and mental health treatment . Case management is a key element in helpingindividuals and families in permanent su p\u00ad portive housing obtain the care they need. Permanent supportive housing can be anapartment or SRO in a building that housesindividuals who were formerly homeless, sp e\u00ad cial-needs housing in the same building with generally affordable housing, a rent -subsidized apartment in the open housing market, desi g\u00ad nated units within privately owned buildings, or individual single -family homes. Examples of populations served by permanentsupportive housing are adolescents, the elderly,persons with serious mental illness, people who are developmentally disabled, and people moving out of transitional or temporary hou s\u00ad ing who still lack the resources to live in thecommunity without housing assistance. Per\u00admanent supportive housing has been shown tobe economically viable by creating safe and 47 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless stable environments in which individuals and families can regain employment, reduce social service and healthcare costs, and reduce costs related to dependence on more expensive housing options. As with transitional housing,permanent supportive housing is supported by HUD, SAMHSA, other Federal resources, State and community resources, and directpayment from those receiving services. SAMHSA 's Homelessness Resource Center (http://homeless.samhsa.gov/ ) offers resources on community housing services for individuals and families who are homeless or threatened with homelessness. Thei r efforts include the Permanent Supportive Housing Evidence -Based Practices (EBP) KIT (SAMHSA, 2010) , a se\u00ad ries of eight booklets on developing perma\u00ad nent supportive housing programs usingevidence -based practices. What the Behavioral Health Service Provider Should Know Your community may offer a variety of hou s\u00ad ing options to behavioral health clients who are homeless or are at high risk for homeles s\u00ad ness. Some of these options are for emergen\u00adcies only or are short term, whereas others are ongoing. S ome have special restrictions, such as serving only persons with a major mental illness or requiring participation in programsto build employment, money management,and daily living skills. Some programs thatprimarily serve clients with substance use di s\u00ad orders have rules about drug use either in the residence or while a client is in the program. However, the permanent supportive housing approach, a major focus of Federal housing assistance today, does not mandate mental health, substance abuse, or other c are or social services as a condition of participation. One of your jobs is to become familiar with the resources in your community. You will want to build linkages with these organiz a\u00ad tions and with their staff members to learn what range of services they provide. This willallow you to recommend particular clients tothese organizations in accordance with their specific needs. What are the requirements foraccessing their services? What types of rei m\u00ad bursement do they accept? You may be aware of gaps in the services available in your co m\u00ad munity. Collaborative efforts can , in some cases, help obtain funding, staff, and facilities to fill these gaps. Part 2 of this TIP discusses \" bottom -up planning,\" in which treatment staff identify a service need and programsevolve in response to it. Bottom -up planning should always involve program administration,direct service personnel, clients, and othercommunity resources. K nowing how to assess your clients' needs is also part of your job. Do they need substance abuse and/or mental health services? Are they ready to accept such services? From w hat types of medical services and financial help would they benefit? Are they self -sufficient? Do fa m\u00ad ily members need prevention services? Dothey require special services to address physical or other disabilities? Are their housing needs chronic and long term or transitional andshort ter m? Along with these questions, you will want to consider the issue of how best to present a program's goals and rules to clients so as toencourag e them to take advantage of comm u\u00ad nity resources. They may need to accept r e\u00ad strictions on their behavior in exchange forshelter. Some negotiation may be necessary tohelp the client see the advantages of receiving services while consenting to a program's boundaries. 48 Part 1, Chapter 1 Housing Services for Individuals With Substance Use and/or Mental Disorders Housing services for people with a substance use disorder and/or a mental illness can be d i\u00ad vided into two broad categories: (1) housingspecifically provided for clients in early andongoing recovery from substance use andmental disorders, and (2) housing that offers asafe place to live, a variety of options forhomelessness rehabilitation, and other social,health, and behavioral health services. Some\u00adtimes , these programs will offer behavioral health treatment and prevention services pr i\u00ad marily directed toward the precontemplationand contemplation phases of treatment. Some communities may offer homelessness and behavioral health treatment services that overlap wi th these two housing options. Add i\u00ad tionally, other shelter or housing options inyour community may simply offer temporary housing with no additional social, physicalhealth, or behavioral health services. Because most communities have few, if any, preventi on services specifically designed for persons whoare homeless, training for prevention workers in the special needs of homeless populations may broaden the range of preventive interven\u00adtions available to th ese population s. Clearly, there is no \"one size fits all\" accom\u00ad modation for the diverse population of people with substance use disorders and/or mental illness who are also faced with homelessness. For example, people who are in crisis andtransitionally homeless need different services from those who a re chronically homeless. Pr o\u00ad grams for persons with mental or substance use disorders may need to work in close coo r\u00ad dination with homelessness programs, esp e\u00ad cially in early recover y. Housing services focused on supporting recovery from substance abuse and mental illness In your work , you will encounter individuals who either are homeless when they enter your program or become homeless during program participation. Some people who are homeless enter programs, especially treatment programs,because they percei ve that they have no other place to go. Others \u2014including persons co m\u00ad ing from the criminal justice system \u2014may have had stable housing (jail or prison) buthave not considered where to live after being released. Some lose their jobs before or duringprogram participation and are left with no housing options. Others may have family members who refuse to allow them to return until they have achieved substantial sobriety,significant stabilization of their psychologicalsymptoms, or significant improvement in i n\u00ad terpersonal skills. In any case, homelessness orthe threat of it represents a substantial crisis that destabilizes people and challenges theirability to maintain recovery and other gains. Homelessness also represents a significant case management problem for mental health and substance abuse treatment staff members who are concerned with finding housing resources.Some considerations that have to be addressed include limited resources for housing people inearly recovery from substance abuse and /or mental illness in the community, the time r e\u00ad quired to find and evaluate potential resources,the collaboration efforts involved in working with other community agencies, and the li m\u00ad ited funding available for housing services a p\u00ad propriate for people in early recovery. Inaddition to addressing these considerations,you will need to ensure that individuals whoare homeless can continue to participate inservices and continuing care. You will need towork with them to manage transportation,mental health, he althcare, financial, criminal 49 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless justice, and employment issues that are co m\u00ad plicated by homelessness.The reality is that an individual who is homeless is in crisis and has housing needs that must be addressed in avery limited period of time. Some frontline resource s often used to help individuals who are homeless make the transi\u00ad tion to more stable recovery are residential re\u00ad covery and other housing options that have a primary focus on recovery from substance abuse and mental illness. Generally, these r e\u00ad sourc es fall into four categories: halfway hous\u00ad es, \u00be -way houses, sober living residences for clients with substance use disorders, and sup\u00adportive housing for clients transitioning out ofintensive mental health treatment or treatment for co -occurring disorders. With perhaps a few exceptions for clients from the criminal justice system, all clients in these residences enter and remain voluntarily. Halfway houses with a primary focus on sub\u00ad stance abuse or mental illness recovery gene r\u00ad ally offer more intensive trea tment than other recovery housing options, have the most struc\u00ad tured programs, and are the most likely to be professionally staffed. They also generally are the most time -limited service (usually 30 -60 days). Persons are likely to enter a halfway house on c ompletion of intensive treatment. In a halfway house, residents are expected to pa r\u00ad ticipate in regularly scheduled (usually daily)individual and group treatment, and regularattendance at 12 -Step or other self -help and recovery programs is either mandated or ac\u00ad tively encouraged. Program rules often limitthe amount of time residents can spend away from the house and the contacts they can havein the community. Programs also specify meal and sleeping times, provide medication ma n\u00ad agement, and usually have an active focus on relapse prevention and recovery maintenance.Case management services, provided by coun\u00adselors or specialized case management staff, are often available. Frequently , supportive ser\u00ad vices, such as employment assistance, health care, and finan cial assistance, are available to residents either \"in house\" or through referral. G enerally, \u00be-way houses have fewer staff per\u00ad sons with professional credentials and may only be staffed by a house manager and assi s\u00ad tants. Residents have more autonomy in ma n\u00ad aging their time and community contacts, and(unless employment is not a consideration forthe client) they are usually employed, expected to be seeking employment, or in a job training and support program. Significantly less trea t\u00ad ment by professionals is offered in \u00be -way houses than in halfway house programs. Resi\u00addents are expected to maintain abstinence , monitor psychological symptoms, and manage their medication with the support of staff; areoften expected to participate in continuingcare and 12 -Step r ecovery programs; and may be encouraged (after some time in the house) to seek other residential options. Clients may have the option of staying in a \u00be -way house for a longer period than in a halfway house. In recent years, a variety of sober living hou s\u00ad ing options have emerged for people in reco v\u00ad ery from substance use disorders and fill a critical need for housing for people in recovery who do not need more intensive residential services. The best known sober living facilities today are Oxford Houses(http://www.oxfordhouse.org ). The Oxford House movement has residential facilities throughout the United States that are drugfree, self -supporting, and democratically go v\u00ad erned by the residents and a board of directors. They normally have 8 to 15 residents. Co m\u00ad plete abstinence from alcohol and illegal orillicit drugs is a requisite for residence. Resi\u00addents can live in the house as long as they d e\u00ad sire. There is no professional staff and there are no requirements about a ttending trea t\u00ad ment. Participation in 12 -Step programs is 50 \"wet,\" \"dry\" refer Part 1, Chapter 1 strongly encouraged. Other sober living houses that are not affiliated with Oxford Houses may also be available in your community. Community transitional supportive housingcan be an intermediate step between leavingan inpatient facility for substance abuse and/ormental health treatment and living inde\u00ad pendent ly in the community. Supportive hou s\u00ad ing programs for people leaving intensive treatment ordinarily provide an afford able place to live; close links to treatment; supportin medication maintenance; services to devel\u00adop and enhance skills in household, job, and financial management; and day -to-day sup\u00ad port from professional and paraprofessional staff. Supportive housing reduces isolation,reduces relapse rates, offers early interventionso that living problems do not escalate, andprovides safe housing for people at a very vul\u00adnerable point in their lives. Housing services focused primarily on safe housing and social services Substance use-related designations for shelter and housing Housing and shelter programs are sometimes defined by policies related to substance use onand off the premises. Different types of hou s\u00ad ing are appropriate for clients in differentstages of chan ge for substance use behavior and who are, in turn, ready for varying levels of service intensity. In h ousing, \"damp,\" and to these levels of service inten\u00ad sity and a concomitant demand for abstinence . Exhibit 1 -7 describes each program t ype. Al\u00ad though programs are defined by allowed sub\u00ad stance use, their services are not restricted to people with substance use disorders. So metimes, people are placed in housing when they are in the precontemplation stage of change regarding their substance use or mental health issues. They may show little or no motivation or behavior suggesting that they would even consider addressing their pro b\u00ad lems. Even so, you may still have several op\u00ad tions for working with clients who are in the precontemplation stage, including: Providing information about recovery andresources that are available, if and whenthey do sense a need to do something about their use. Building stronger relationship s focused on their ability to contact a service provider if they decide to get help for substance use. Supporting their efforts to consider or act on changing substance use behavior \u2014for instance, by supporting efforts toward a b\u00ad stinence, even for brief periods. Helping individuals develop or improve coping skills for managing life without substances. Locating housing in congregate living se t\u00ad tings with staff members on site who can provide safety and support. Concerns , such as drug trafficking on the premises, may be a particular risk factor for some persons attempting to maintain a bsti\u00ad nence. Onsite staff persons have a greater o p\u00ad portunity to build relationships by sharingactivities and conversation. They can also as\u00adsess an individual's functioning and engage them in appropriate services. Services for veterans who are homeless In addition to services available in the co m\u00ad munity and local treatment system, veterans who are homeless may be eligible for VA ser\u00advices. Eligibility varies for each of these ser\u00advices. In general, eligibility is least restrictive for entry to VA homeless ness programs. Those who have a service -connected disability or VA pension are most likely to access VA services.Nearly every VA hospital has a Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) Program caseworker who can inform you about local services and eligibility criteria.

Stand Downs : These give veterans who are homeless 1 -3 days of safety and security where they can obtain food, shelter, clot h\u00ad ing, and other types of assistance, includingVA-provided hea lth care, benefits certifica\u00ad tion, and linkages with other programs. Drop -In Centers: These programs are a daytime sanctuary where veterans who are homeless can clean up, wash their clothes,and participate in therapeutic and rehabil i\u00ad tative activities . Recovery -oriented and rehabilitative programs for veterans who are homeless include: Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans (DCHV): DCHV provides residential treatment and rehabilitation to veterans who are homeless. VA Grant & Per Diem Program: This program subsidizes residential treatmentand transitional housing.

Homelessness services in rural areas People who are homeless in rural and remote areas typically live temporarily in campers,cars, abandoned buildings, tent encampments,or with a succession of friends or family inovercrowded, substandard housing (Dempster& Gillig, 2006). As a r esult, people who are homeless in rural areas are often less visible than those in more urban settings and may notbe counted in census or other surveys. Out\u00adreach and engagement are different in rural areas than in urban centers , because people who are hom eless in rural areas are more diff i\u00ad cult to identify. In addition, outreach and e n\u00ad gagement activities are successful only if you can refer individuals to services relevant to r e\u00ad habilitation from homelessness. Job opportunities, transportation, health and social services, and shelter options tend to be more limited in rural areas. Individuals with mental illness who are homeless and unable to live with family in rural areas may be partic u\u00ad larly vulnerable and may migrate to largerpopulation areas to obtain h ousing and ser\u00ad vices. In rural areas where the predominantemployment is agriculture, migrant workerswho are homeless and depend on employer -supplied housing can be particularly vulner a\u00ad ble. Often , the housing offered for temporarily employed migrant workers is substandard andinadequate, creating a unique situation ofhomelessness or near homelessness. To create temporary shelter, some providers develop contracts with local property owners in which an agency pays a monthly rate forsleeping rooms used as temporary housing un\u00adtil other arrangements are made. This may be more cost -effective when actual numbers of clients do not warrant larger shelter programs; it gives the individual and the agency flexibility to better prepare for more adequate housing. Insome locations, faith -based communities can temporarily house people for brief periods in members' homes, church buildings, or in low - cost motels paid for with money set aside to help those in need. SAMHSA's PATH program provides formula grants to States, wh ich they can then use for homelessness services in rural areas. The grants can be used for outreach, screening, b e\u00ad havioral health services, case management, andother supports for housing assistance . A pr i\u00ad mary problem is that, given the actual numberof individuals and families needing a specific form of housing among a dispersed, rural po p\u00ad ulation, costs for the construction of congr e\u00ad gate housing or shelters can be prohibitive. As a result, developing an adequate supply ofrental stock and providing rental subsidies may take on particular importance. There is often a waiting list in rural areas for housingthat is available through programs servingpeople who are homeless. Where adequate services do not exist, workers in PATH -supported outreach and engag e\u00ad ment programs in rural areas often carry sleep ing bags, camping gear, and food. Some programs employ former consumers who canestablish good rapport with individuals whoare homeless. The programs work to create 53 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless linkages and good relationships with nearby communities and agencies (Robertson & M y\u00ad ers, 2005). The National Alliance to EndHomelessness (2010) emphasizes using nat u\u00ad rally occurring support networks in rural areas to provide support to people who are home\u00adless. Involvement of local area leaders and stakeholders promotes an inclusive, collabor a\u00ad tive system. You Can Do It Working with clients who are homeless or atrisk of homelessness certainly increases the complexity of your job. Clients who are facing homelessness have unique personal and env i\u00ad ronmenta l dilemmas that require special care and attention. Nevertheless, with some add i\u00ad tional knowledge, enhanced skills, and an ex\u00ad amination of your own attitudes toward homelessness, you can do this work effectively. The skills required will simply complementthe skills you already have as a treatment orprevention professional. The additional knowledge you need will benefit not only yourwork with people who are homeless, but also your work with any person who has layeredproblems. A significant milestone in pro fes\u00ad sional growth is expanding your horizons andcapabilities to work with different types ofpeople, some of whom have more complexneeds than others. In the next chapter , you will meet several peo\u00ad ple who are homeless and in various stages of need, and you will examine how your new andexpanded knowledge, skills, and attitudes canbe applied in realistic treatment and preven\u00ad tion service situations. 54 IN THIS CHAPTER Introduction Vignette 1 \u2014Juan Vignette 2 \u2014Francis Vignette 3 \u2014Roxanne Vignette 4 \u2014Troy Vignette 5 \u2014Ren\u00e9 Vignette 6 \u2014Mikki Vignette 7 \u2014Sammy Part 1, Chapter 2 Part 1, Chapter 2 Introduction In this chapter, you will meet several people with behavioral health disorders who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Each person is introduced in a vignette that demonstrates effective approaches to treatment for people who are in different phases of homelessness rehabilitation (described in Part 1, Chapter 1) and who have a su b\u00ad stance use and/or mental disorder. Prevention techniques andmethods to reduce the incidence or manifestations of mental illness or substance abuse are also demonstrated. Skills introduced in the seven vignettes include: Building rapport. Identifying client strengths, needs, preferences, and resources in housing and other life issues. Managing inappropriate behavior, requests, and expectations. Providing case management to access an d coordinate housing and other services. Developing and monitoring treatment and housing goals. Assisting clients in improving coping skills. Adapting services for people who have cognitive problems. Adopting a trauma- informed approach to working with all cli\u00ad ents who are homeless. Helping clients stay engaged in recovery despite ongoing men\u00ad tal illness/ substance abuse symptoms. Recognizing the impact of co -occurring disorders (CODs) on recovery from homelessness. Helping clients find appropriate housing among the variety ofoptions that may be available. Preparing clients to accept the terms of rental agreements andother housing constraints. Each vignette begins by describing the setting, learning objectives,strategies and techniques, and counselor skills and attitudes specific 55 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless to that vignette. A description is given of a client's situation and current symptoms. Counselor - client dialog is provided to facilitate learning, along with a selection of aids that may include: Master clinician notes : comments from an experienced clinician about the strategies used, possible alternative techniques, and insights into what the client or prospective client may be thinking. How -to notes : step-by-step information on how to implement a specific intervention . Decision trees : aids to help you sort options and arrive at the best possible outcome. The master clinician represents the combined experience of the contributors to this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP ). Master clinician notes assist behavioral hea lth counselors at all le v\u00ad els: beginners, those with some experience, and master clinicians. Before using the described techniques, it is your responsibility to determine whether you have sufficient training in the skill set and to ensure that you are pract icing within the legal and ethical bounds of your training, certifications, and licenses. It is always helpful to obtain clinical superv i\u00ad sion in developing or enhancing clinical skills. For additional information on clinical supervision, see TIP 52 , Clinic al Supervision and the Professional Development of the Substance Abuse Counselor (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment [CSAT ], 2009b). For the convenience of the reader, the TIP refers in the vignettes to \"counselor\" generally rather than specifically by name. This will make it easier for the reader to track who is speaking at any given point in the vignette. As you are reading, try to imagine yourself through the course of the vignette in the role of the counselor. The seven vignettes are as follows: Vigne tte 1: Juan is in the outreach and engagement (O&E) phase of homelessness rehabilit a\u00ad tion. This vignette demonstrates approaches and techniques for responding to his chronichomelessness. Vignette 2: Francis is in the outreach and engagement phase of homelessness rehabilitation. This vignette demonstrates approaches and techniques for responding to his health and saf e\u00ad ty concerns. Vignette 3: Roxanne is in the intensive care phase of homelessness rehabilitation. This v i\u00ad gnette demonstrates approaches and techniques for preventing homelessness and stabilizing aclient who is in the precontemplation stage of substance abuse treatment. Vignette 4: Troy is in the intensive care phase of homelessness rehabilitation. This vignette demonstrates approaches and techniques for preventing homelessness and engaging the clientin substance abuse treatment. Vignette 5: Ren\u00e9 is in the transition planning/ongoing homelessness rehabilitation phase. This vignette demonstrates approaches and techniques for substance abuse relapse preven\u00adtion. Vignette 6: Mikki is in the early intervention stage of homelessness prevention. This vignette demonstrates approaches and techniques for preventing additional trauma to her family b e\u00ad cause of temporary homelessness. Vignette 7: Sammy is in the permanent supportive stage of homelessness rehabilitation. This vignette demonstrates approaches and techniques for supporting access to housing for a client with serious mental illness (SMI) through programs partially funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA 's) Projects for Assistance in Tra n\u00ad sition from Homelessness (PATH) p rogram . 56 Part 1, Chapter 2 Vignette 1 \u2014Juan Overview Juan is in the outreach and engagement phase of homelessness rehabilitation. This vignette demonstrates approaches and techniques for responding to his chronic homelessness. Juan is in his mid -thirties and is chronically homeless. He is dependent on crack cocaine, drinks alcohol, and occasionally smokes marijuana. He typically sits alone at a soup kitchen table. He knows who the outreach team members are and has walked away in the past when approached. The outreach team has information about Juan from shelter staff members and other people who are homeless. He is unemployed but has worked in the past. Juan is hypersensitive to being \"put down\" by others. He is easy to anger, and his anger is often out of proportion to the stimulus. If he feels criticized, he will become sarcastic and will withdraw from interaction with others. He is very suspicious of the motives of others, often expecting that people have an agenda to disrespecthim. These limitations have resulted in many losses: jobs, family relationships, apartment s, and social supports. He has a history of being banned from shelters as a result of outbursts andfighting. The outreach team members believe that if they form a relationship with Juan and offer him a place to live, they will be able to engage him in treatment. Sub stance use is believed to play a significant role in Juan's homelessness, so the member of the team who provides substance abuse counseling will take the lead in engaging him. The counse\u00adlor's goals for the first visit are to: Meet Juan and begin to establish a relationship with him. Determine whether or not Juan will engage in a conversation about housing and other ser\u00advices. Setting The behavioral health counselor is a member of a community -based, interagency O&E team and works for a mental health and substance abuse treatment organization providing O&E services in collaboration with counselors, case managers, and outreach workers from other organizations.A Housing First program is available to clients through this interagency partnership. Learning Objectives Use rapport -building outreach methods: - Accurately identify the client's beliefs and frame of reference. - Reflect the client's feelings and message. - Demonstrate empathy, respect, and genuineness. - Offer concrete assistance. Establish an initial plan based on the client's needs and preferences, community resources, and the intervention plan. Determine the client's stage of change; respond appropriately to changes in client behavior . Strategies and Techniques Rapport and relationship building with a client who is difficult to reach 57 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Housing F irst as an approach to provide safe and stable housing Motivational interviewing (MI) Counselor Skills and Attitudes Recognize and address ambivalence and resistance. Work as a member of a team to remove barriers to services. Emphasize client autonomy and development of skills. Show respect for both the client's needs and the organization's services. Help the client explore resources and determine which ones he would like to use. Vignette Visit 1 (soup kitchen) The counselor walks to a seat near Juan at the soup kitchen, noticing that Juan watches her from the corner of his eye and appears tense. He sits alone and appears disinterested in the going s-on around him. COUNSELOR: How's it going? JUAN: Do you work here? COUNSELOR: I work for the local outreach and engagement team. JUAN: You're treating people? [He talks to her, but his demeanor is aloof and suspicious, and he maintains his distance.] Master Clinician Note: Building relationships wit h people who are homeless proceeds at their pace. You can give people opportunities to accept assistance, but it is important that you consistently respect their choices. If someone refuses to talk to you, respectfully leave and plan to show up again with something the client might accept (e.g., coffee, socks, a chance to talk). Building relationships with soup kitchen workers who know the client can help you gather more information and facilitate a meeting. COUNSELOR: No. I get to go out and spend time with people out here. Do you mind if I sit down? [ Juan nods. ] What do you think of the coffee here? J UAN: Not too good. Better than nothin'. COUNSELOR: Better than nothin', that's for sure. The food's okay? JUAN: Yeah. This is a good place to eat, you know, a meal. What's your name? COUNSELOR: It's Megan. How about yours? JUAN: I'm Juan. COUNSELOR: It's nice to meet you. So you've been in the area long? 58 Housing First Models Housing First approaches have been used to engage people who are chronically homeless and have severe and chronic mental illnesses. The goals of Housing First are to end homelessness and promote client choice, recovery, and community integration. Housing First engages people whom traditional supportive housing providers have been unable to engage by offering immediate access to perm a\u00ad nent scatter- site independent apartments in buildings rented from private landlords. Clients have their own lease or sublease and only risk eviction from their apartments for nonpayment of rent, cr e\u00ad ating unacceptable disturbances to neighbors, or other violations of a standard lease. To prevent evictions, teams work closely with clients and landlords to address potential problems. Refusal to e n\u00ad gage in treatment does not precipitate a loss of housing. Relapses to substance abuse or mental health crises are addressed by providing intensive treatment or facilitating admission to detoxific a\u00ad tion or the hospital to address the clinical crisis. Afterward, clients return to their apartments. Support services are often offered through multidisciplinary assertive community treatment (ACT) teams, with slight modifications. Source: Stein & Santos, 1998. Part 1, Chapter 2 [Juan says that he's been in town for a while and knows his way around. He's currently staying at a shelter that he doesn't like. The noise keeps him up at night, his things get stolen, and there are too many rules. He says he 'd rather camp out, except for the police. The counselor mentions the possibility of housing.] Master Clinician Note: Nonclinical conv ersation is an important outreach tool. Social conversation is an icebreaker and helps identify a person's interests and needs. While th e counselor talks with Juan, she listens for information that will help her guide him in creating a recovery plan \u2014that i s, information that may indicate some of Juan's strengths and limitations, problems related to substance use and homelessness, housing history, goals, values, and so forth . COUNSELOR: If you were to have your own place, what would that be like for you? JUA N: Well, that's what I do if I find a building where I can camp out. I make it my own place. Master Clinician Note: Having clients imagine themselves in a desired situation can help you identify what matters to them and the barriers to their goals. Open questions and reflection encourage Juan to elaborate. COUNSELOR: You set up house. J UAN: Right. Right now I don't have an income, so there's no way I can pay the rent or get a place, so I'm just making the best of what I got. COUNSELOR: I t's hard to imagine what i t'd be like to move into your own place right now b ecause it's hard to imagine how you'd get it. You don't have any income, and that's a problem. JUAN: Right. COUNSELOR: One of the things I do is help people find places to live that they can afford. JUAN: Are you playing a game? You want me to go to treatment or something like that? 59 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless COUNSELOR: No, you don't have to go to treatment to get into housing. We have a program called \"Housing First\" that might really be something you could look into. J UAN: Well, I don't understand. Why would you do that for me? COUNSELOR: I think somebody would do that for you if they thought you could do it success\u00adfully. JUAN: My own place \u2014somebody's gonna give me my own place? COUNSELOR: Doesn't make a lot of sense to you, does it? JUAN: No ; what's the catch? COUNSELOR: You and I would have to have a plan for how you would hang onto that place. Master Clinician Note: The counselor demonstrates that the client can expect her to be honest about what to expect. As he considers making a change, it's natural for him to feel ambivalent about it and back off. This is part of the process of engagement, and the counselor doesn't want to prevent his ambivalence from arising. In the following exchange, she'll reflect both sides of his ambivalence so he can see the discrepancy between where he is now and where he wants to be. This is a technique from MI. Additional information on MI can be found in TIP 35, Enhancing Motivation for Change in Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT, 1999b). JUAN: Make a plan for how somebody wouldn't take it away from me. COUNSELOR: How you'd be able to hang onto it, yeah. So that would mean income. Let me ask you this: When you got your last place, how did you do that? JUAN: Uh, I got on assistance and they just took the rent out of that, so I never saw the rent check. But I got kicked out 'cause I had friends over, and we were partying. It got loud and some\u00ad body got into a fight, and then somebody else called the police. The next week I was out. I still get my disability assistance from the government. COUNSELOR: So, a couple of things happened there. You got on assistance that paid the rent, you got your place, and then your friends came over and had a party. Things got loud and people started fighting, and that caused a problem. Master Clinician Note: The counselor gathers housing history information and summarizes what Juan says to reinforce her understanding of how he lost his housing. Reflecting Juan's response empathically helps him feel heard and accepted and builds a mutual understanding of the issues they will need to address to make his plan for housing work. The counselor carefully avoids blaming Juan for losing his housing. JUAN: Yeah. It's not like other people weren't having parties. They were having them every weekend, so I had a party, and the next week, I'm out of there. COUNSELOR: It didn't make any sense to you that you were bounced out and other people gotto stay, even though they were having the same kind of parties. 60 Part 1, Chapter 2 JUAN: Yeah. I don't want rules for when I can c ome and go or who I can have visit and stay over. C OUNSELOR: You want to be able to come and go as you please. JUAN: Yeah. Just like anybody else paying rent for an apartment. COUNSELOR: What other sorts of things do you think would be reas onable for a landlord to a sk from you? Paying rent, that's one. Master Clinician Note: Given Juan's history of homelessness and tendency to be irritable, the issue of reasonable expectations of a landlord is a touchy one. To avoid provoking Juan, the counselor is eliciting and reinforcing his understanding of reasonable expectations from a landlord. JUAN: Pay for your rent.Take care of the place. Don't smash in the walls. Stuff like that. C OUNSELOR: Okay. So you wouldn't tear the place up and you'd pay the rent. The only other t hing from the last story is that it sounds like maybe your guests might get a little loud. J UAN: Yeah. I mean, what can you do in that situation? You ask the guys to keep quiet. If you try t o throw them out, you may get hurt yourself. COUNSELOR: You're not real sure what to do if they start being that way. JUAN: Right. COUNSELOR: So if we're going to make a plan , we might need to include some ideas about tha t for you. JUAN: Like, no parties? COUNSELOR: Well, how to deal with that kind of situation . We could look at your options a nd see what you'd like to do. How does that sound to you? JUAN: You mean you're offering me a place now? COUNSELOR: I'm offering to work with you to help you see if it's something you want. Master Clinician N ote: If the counselor agrees with Juan's understanding of her offer, then she's agreeing to help him find a home before they have agreed on how they'll work together to help him keep it. She's balancing good judgment with moving at his pace. From his histo ry, she knows that if he's housed without being confident that he can adhere to the terms of a standard lease, he'll be at high risk for a return to homelessness. JUAN: Yeah, I mean, I'd like that. COUNSELOR: Well, there are a couple of things that you and I need to do. The first step is to begin to fill out an application where I'm going to ask you for \u2014 J UAN: [interrupts] Filling out lots of papers? 61 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless [As they move toward beginning the process, Juan experiences more intense ambivalence. The counselor expected this and responds to it with acceptance.] COUNSELOR: It's not pleasant, is it. How do you feel about that? JUAN: [irritably ] Eh, I don't need to get into that stuff. If that is where this is going, I don't want to go there. I don't need that stuff. COUNSELOR: Okay. I can appreciate that. [Juan's ambivalence intensifies. He backs his chair away and leaves, ignoring the counselor's r e\u00ad quest for him to wait. The next time she sees Juan, she tries to approach him, but he walks away.] Visit 2 (shelter) A few days after the first visit, the counselor finds out that Juan is at the shelter and stops by in hopes of bumping into him. Her goals for this meeting are: To ree ngage him. To offer him the opportunity to look at an apartment that has become available. If he wants the apartment, to see whether he can create a plan that will help him keep it. Juan is cranky but agrees to talk to the counselor. He says he's been in the shelter for 4 days, thata staff member is badgering him into substance abuse treatmen t, and that he's getting ready to leave. Noting the opportunity, she reflects his wish for new accommodations and offers to take him to see an apartment. COUNSELOR: So, you could use some options like maybe having a place to stay. We have an apartment that 's become available, and the last time we talked, you sounded like you might be interested in something like that if it could be worked out to your satisfaction. I wonder if you'd be interested in taking a look. JUAN: [ suspiciously ] Now? COUNSE LOR : Ye s , I have a van here and a coworker from my outreach team. We c an take you. JUAN: All right, where is it? Not around here? COUNSELOR: Well, it's not immediately around here. It's a few miles away. JUAN: Well, I kinda like this part of town. COUNSELOR: So that would be a big change for you, being way over there. Tough decision whether to go see a place that far out of your usual space. But, it's near a bus stop. JUAN: Sure. Well, I'll go take a look at it. [The counselor and her colleague drive Juan to the apartment. As she shows him the building, he mentions a landscaping job he had. He's proud of his landscaping abilities and describes being fired.] JUAN: Yeah, I changed the garden around to make it better , a nd they told me I was doing stuff I wasn't supposed to do. They just didn't know what they were doing. I said, \" I'm outta here.\" 62 Part 1, Chapter 2 COUNSELOR: I see . So as far as you're concerned, they didn't appreciate that you were taking initiative to try to make things better. JUAN: Oh, yeah! Right on. [They look around, and the counselor tells Juan he can move in when the paperwork is approved and they are able to reach an agreement to help him keep this apartment.] COUNSELOR: We have to do the paperwork and work out a plan that makes you and everyone else feel confident that you would be able to keep this place. JUAN: Like whether you're bringing in bags with bottles in them, or ... ? COUNSELOR: No, they don't complain about people bringing in bags with bottles in them. Remember that party you were talking about where things got heavy and the cops came? That's the sort of thing that would cause concern. You and I are going to have to figure out what theprogram guidelines are and what that means for you. Master Clinician Note: Juan is in the precontemplation stage of change for substance abuse and the contemplation stage of change for housing (see Part 1, Chapter 1, of this TIP). The counselor is seeking to enhance the relationship with him to support his engagement \u2014first to obtain housing and then to help him move toward acti ng on other issues in his life, particularly his substance abuse. [Juan agrees to go back to the shelter to start the paperwork despite his ambivalence. At the shelter, the counselor begins to collect information about Juan's housing history for the appli ca\u00ad tion. She mentions the party that led to his most recent eviction.] COUNSELOR: We started talking about the parties and how those can disturb other people. JUAN: Well, it's not like other people didn't have parties. I didn't complain about that. COUNSELOR: So this is one of those areas where it may feel like you're being treated unfairly. Master Clinician Note: Again, the counselor is careful to reframe this issue to be about Juan's experience of what happened and avoid making him feel blamed, judged, or disrespected by the counselor. This is especially important given his sensitivity to feeling criticized. JUAN: [ irritably ] I can tell you, I'm not gonna stop having my friends over. C OUNSELOR: Okay. JUAN: [ still irritably ] What's the point of havi ng your own place if you can't do what you want? I 'm not saying they're gonna come over and bust the place up. I don't want that, either. But ... COUNSELOR: Well, you don't want people to come over and bust the place up and neither would any landlord. That makes sense to you. That seems reasonable. JUAN: Yeah, sure, yeah. But these guys weren't fighting, nothing got broken, and they weren't any louder than the couple next door hollering at each other all the time. 63 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless COUNSELOR: Right. So, you feel like the thing that happened last time, the thing that caused the problem, you didn't feel it was as big a deal as they made it out to be. JUAN: No. No way! COUNSELOR: There really wasn't anything there for them to be concerned about at all. Master Clinician Note: The counselor is using a technique known as \"ov er\u00ad reflecting. \" This deliberate emphasis on Juan's initial opinion concerning the episode invites him to think more deeply about the episode and his feelings, evoking self- reflection, especially because he is a person who may not spontaneously self -reflect. There are risks with this approach\u2014such as provoking defensive anger \u2014but if presented with a nonconfrontational and supportive tone, even the most sensitive people will not respond negatively. JUAN: No. They j ust didn't treat me right \u2014with respect. COUNSELOR: That was the problem ; it felt like they were kind of singling you out. JUAN: Yeah. And then that guy upstairs was always playing that #*%! speaker \u2014I could feel the #*%!ing thing in my ceiling. Nobody else complained about that! They didn't kick him out. COUNSELOR: Uh -huh. So part of what made you so angry the last time was that it seemed like everybody else was doing this stuff and not getting into trouble for it. Y ou were the only one. JUAN: Right! COUNSEL OR: It's hard for you to see what was different about your situation that got you kicked out. JUAN: There wasn't anything different about this! They just need the excuse of their #*%!ing rules! I think it's better sometimes just to camp out. Nobody tells y ou what to do. COUNSELOR: One of the things that's easier about camping out is that you don't have to deal with other people's ideas about the things you're doing. JUAN: Right. If things get bad there, you just move off to another place, and that's cool. COUNSELOR: That's right. You just keep moving around when it starts to get bad. So that's some of the good stuff about camping out; you don't have to put up with other people's co m\u00ad plaints. If we're going to make this apartment work for you, we need to figu re out how to help you manage those situations. I can't guarantee that the housing manager won't have some opi n\u00ad ions about any parties you might throw. Master Clinician Note: The counselor identifies a potential challenge for Juan in maintaining stable housing. The counselor avoids an adversarial stance by also commenting on the client's coping mechanisms in an accepting manner. Thus , the counselor attempts to begin to frame the issue of housing stability as an objective \" problem\" that would need to be \"solved\" by Juan with the counselor's support. 64 Part 1, Chapter 2 JUAN: Those guys, they weren't fighting, they were arguing with me. Maybe they got a little bit loud, but they didn't bust up the place. COUNSELOR: That's another thing that might happen, right? You might have som e friends over and they might just be hanging out, and somebody else might complain. That'd be tough for you to deal with. JUAN: Yeah. What's the use of moving in to a place and you have some friends over and some\u00ad body complains and they kick you out in a week? [angry, dejected, and disgusted ] Hell, let's just give it up. I don't want to mess with this anymore. COUNSELOR: Okay, I appreciate that. [Juan abruptly leaves.] Master Clinician Note: The counselor knows that a lot is at stake for Juan; if he tries and fails, he might feel humiliated, so he's avoiding the risk of failure. This is a common response for people experiencing homelessness who are considering making a change. Some clients may experience ambivalence about change more intensely because failure causes them intense humiliation. Understanding this makes it easier for the counselor to accept Juan's ambivalence. Visit 3 (soup kitchen) Juan disappears for a few days. When he shows up at the soup kitchen, he looks like he hasn't slept for several days, seems to have been using, appears especially unkempt, and has a black eye and other bruises. The counselor asks if she can sit down. He shrugs with a disgusted look butsays okay. She takes a seat. The counselor says that Juan doesn't really look like himself today. Juan explains that he was a t\u00ad tacked by someone outside the shelter. She asks whether he's had any medical attention. Juan says no and that he's not interested in getting any. He's not seriously injured, though his bruise looks ugly; the counselor's anxiety increases on seeing Juan's condition. She notices her anxiety andconsciously relaxes so she can honor his freedom of choice instead of trying to push him to a c\u00ad cept health c are. She also notes that Juan gets into pretty serious fights despite portraying himself as someone who stays out of them. Juan agrees to have the counselor check in with him later. The counselor discusses Juan's condition with her supervisor , and they de cide that she should continue to check on him over the next couple of days and watch for any changes in his functio n\u00ad ing. If she notices a decrease in his ability to function, she will address this again with him and with her supervisor. Visit 4 (soup kitchen) When the counselor finds Juan in the soup kitchen several days later, he looks better. His eye is healing, he's sleeping and eating better, and he has a decent spot on the street where he can getout of the weather. Her goal is to engage him into housing and other services. COUNSELOR: So you're feeling like staying at this construction site is working for you? 65 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless JUAN: Just a little while. I mean, when they start opening up the fence and bringing in the big equipment and stuff, I won't be able to stay there. Are you still putting people in those apar t\u00ad ments? COUNSELOR: I certainly am. You think you might be interested in that? J UAN: I don't know. There's all that rules stuff, people telling you what to do. COUNSELOR: Well, it's a tough decision . JUAN: On t he other hand, I might only be able to stay at this construction site for another week. COUNSELOR: You're getting to the point where you need a more permanent plan for where y ou stay. JUAN: Yeah, it would be nice. COUNSELOR: Y eah. Y ou want to talk about it some more? JUAN: Yeah. COUNSELOR: One thing we ask is that you stay in the shelter a few nights before going into an apartment so we can get to know you a bit. We want to en sure that the housing fits your style and priorities. Master Clinician Note: The counselor avoids confrontation and allows Juan to save face while also emphasizing his need for success. Note: Housing First models generally don't require potential clients to spend any amount of time in a shelter prior to entering housing. Getting to know or assessing the client can occur on the street, in the Housing First program offices, or at sites in the community. [Juan is concerned about returning to the shelter where he had the fight, because they made him leave. The counselor says some of the shelter staff members are familiar with Juan and his situ a\u00ad tion, and she'll talk to them about helping him possibly get his shelter housing back. Several days later, when they discuss Juan's situation with the shelter staff, Juan agrees to the shelter's rules and says he'd like to stay there until the apartment paperwork is complete and approved.] Visit 5 (shelter) Megan talk s with shelter staff the next day and checks in with Juan. Her goals for the visit are to: Collect information for the housing applicatio n. Create a plan to address the issues that have caused Juan to lose housing in the past. The counselor tells Juan that he has impressed the staff by staying out of arguments and notcausing problems. She emphasizes this as Juan's accomplishment to reinforce his sense of pride inadaptive behavior. As we pick up the session, the counselor is collecting information about Juan's housing history. COUNSELOR: So far, there are a couple of things I know. I know you've had an apartment b e\u00ad fore. And we've talked about what happened with that apartment. I'm wondering about other places you've lived. 66 Part 1, Chapter 2 JUAN: Actually, a couple different places. I had a friend, Tom. We shared a place for a while. COUNSELOR: And how did you get that place? JUAN: He got it. I don't know. He just asked me if I wanted to move in and split the rent. COUNSELOR: Okay. And how were you affording your rent at that time? JUAN: I was hustling, moving product \u2014drugs and stuff. I didn't have a regular type job. COUNSELOR: That's how you were getting the money to pay the rent and to use? JUAN: Right. COUNSELOR: So, that was one apartment you had with Tom. How long did that last? JUAN: I guess about 2 months. COUNSELOR: What other places? JUAN: Well, when I was working for that landscaper, I had my own place for more than a year. COUNSELOR: Oh, so that worked out well. That's a long time to hold on to a place. JUAN: Yeah. COUNSELOR: So you had the job first, and then got the apartment on your own. JUAN: Yeah, those were some good times! COUNSELOR: You liked that work, and you were good at it. JUAN: Yeah. I liked being outside, working with the plants, seeing stuff grow and look nice. [The counselor gathers the rest of Juan's housing, substance abuse, family, financial, and health hi story. The longest he's been housed is a year. He loses housing because of drug use and fighting. It's important to him to spend time with friends.The counselor notes that he will need positive social supports to maintain his housing. He reveals that he's on parole but hasn't seen his parole officer (PO) in 10 months. He's worried about an outstanding warrant. They discuss the need to address his legal issues, and the counselor offers her support through the process. Juan expresses some discomfort talking about his parole issues. Agreeing to set this aside for now, the counselor shifts the focus to Juan's relationship with his family. J uan's brother lives upstate, and his parents live in town; he hasn't had contact with them for 3 years. He doesn't make contact with them because he believes that they're going to worry about him. The counselor believes his family could help support Juan's recovery. Once he's settled, he may be interested in inviting his family to his apartment, which could open a discussion about how his havi ng an apartment is great but may also prompt conversation about his drug use. When the time comes to create a plan with Juan for substance abuse treatment, the counselor will ask about his interest in including his family in that plan. 67 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless The counselor assesses Juan's substance use and other likely problems based on what she already knows. They will use the information to create a plan to support housing stability and recovery. The counselor continues to gather information on Juan's substance abuse.] COUNSELO R: We talked already about your use of crack. I wonder what other drugs you might use. J UAN: I smoke a little grass every once in a while. Not on a regular basis. COUNSELOR: So every so often , some pot. What else? JUAN: I drink to come down. Wine helps me get to sleep. COUNSELOR: Wine. What else? JUAN: That's pretty much it , and all that other stuff I mentioned. C OUNSELOR: So you use some grass and some wine to come down. But the one you use most is crack. J UAN: Yes. Master Clinician Note: Asking \" what else?\" and reflecting the client's response invites the client to elaborate. This lets the counselor explore client motivation for substance use without evoking resistance. Similarly, in the next exchange, she uses \"tell me more\" to gather details ab out psychiatric symptoms. COUNSELOR: Okay. I'd like to ask you a couple of questions about just how you have been feeling. Have you been feeling depressed, sad, like you are not enjoying things that you mightusually enjoy? JUAN: I haven't been too good u p here [ points to his head ] the p ast few weeks, so\u2014 COUNSELOR: Well, tell me more about the past couple of weeks. JUAN: I always wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep with guys playing music at the shelter and stuff, and that pisse s me off. Master Clinician Note: The counselor is attempting to maintain and build the relationship with Juan through reflection, restating, and paraphrasing his comments. This is an effective technique from MI, although the counselor needs to be aware that the technique can be overused. If overused, rapport with the client will suffer. COUNSELOR: So you are having some trouble sleeping. What else is going on? J UAN: That's pretty much it. COUNSELOR: That's pretty much it. What about feeling anxious or irritable and angry? JUAN: Well, yeah. All those things. 68 How To Summarize for Your Client Be concise. This makes for clarity and easier processing for the client. When summarizing: If possible, use the words and phrases the client has used. Be as accurate as possible in restating what the client seems to be tryi ng to say. Try to not exa g\u00ad gerate or minimize what the client has said. Use phrases such as \"What I am understanding is ...\" or \"It seems that you' re saying ...\" and check with the client to see if your understanding is correct. If the client says you are not understanding, ask him or her to tell you again and use the client's words in your feedback. Sometimes , it may be important to let the client know that understanding what he or she is say\u00ad ing does not imply approval of potential actions. For instance, if a client says they want to hurt someone else, be sure your feedback does not imply that you agree with their intent. Part 1, Chapter 2 COUNSELOR: All those things from time to time. Is there ever a point where they are really causing big problems for you or getting in the way of other things you want to do? JUAN: Yeah. I walked off t hat job. That was a dumb thing to do. C OUNSELOR: So that's one case of feeling angry and making a choice you didn't really want to make. J UAN: Yeah, that wasn't a good thing to do. It happens. COUNSELOR: I hope that when you get settled in your apartment and when things are going better , we can talk about what happens when you get angry and get yourself in trouble. J UAN: Yeah. COUNSELOR: Juan, tell me some more about your sleep problem. JUAN: Well, the wine just levels me off , helps me get to sleep. But then, when I drink a lot of wi ne, I wake up in the middle of the night and I can't go back to sleep. COUNSELOR: Y eah, so that's sort of interfering with your sleep, too, you've noticed. JUAN: I can't get to sleep without it, but then I wake up in the mid dle of the night. [The counselor is supporting the client's growing awareness of the relationship between sleeping p roblems and substance use patterns.] COUNSELOR: You drink wine to come down and fall asleep, but you've noticed that when you drink, you wake up in the middle of the night. J UAN: Yeah, but it's better than going for a couple more days without getting any sleep. COUNSELOR: How much sleep do you usually get? JUAN: Don't know ... 4 or 5 hours, maybe. COUNSELOR: How much do you think you need? JUAN: Maybe 6 or 7, 6 and a half hours. 69 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless COUNSELOR: How often do you usually get that? J UAN: Huh! Almost never. COUNSELOR: Not very often. So you walk around sleep deprived most of the time. JUAN: Well, I never really thought about it that way. I'd like to sleep longer. COUNSELOR: Y eah. Y ou and I could work on ways to get a good night's sleep, and you've a l\u00ad r eady connected wine with trouble staying asleep, and you have trouble falling asleep. JUAN: Yeah. Without the wine , I lie in bed a long time before I drop off. COUNSELOR: We could see what we can do to help you, if you would like us to do that. JUAN: I don't know what, but yeah, if somet hing can be done , I'm all for it. Maybe later. Master Clinician Note: The counselor suspects, from the symptoms Juan has described, such as depression, anger, and anxiety reactions, that he might have a trauma disorder, but she avoids probing his trauma ex perience , which might, given his situation now, destabilize him and/or disrupt their developing rapport. Instead, she focuses on Juan's main related concern: sleep. She helps him see how these symptoms may be related to substance use. Once Juan has stabilized in housing and is possibly more receptive to engaging in counseling, she will help him access care for both his substance use disorder and, if necessary, his trauma disorder. For more information on working with clients who have trauma symptoms, see th e planned TIP , Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services (SAMHSA, planned h). COUNSELOR: Okay. Do you ever have any beliefs that other people don't have, or do you see things other people don't see or hear things other people don't hear? JUAN: No . I'm not crazy, man. C OUNSELOR: That's not you. Are there other problems you want me to be aware of at this point? Anything else that you would like us to work on? J UAN: Just the apartment. COUNSELOR: The apartment. So at this point , we've completed thi s paperwork . The housing program will discuss this application, and we will get an arrangement that we can all agree to. J UAN: Okay. COUNSELOR: So, some of the things we've talked about working on are sleep, legal issues, a n\u00ad g er, and how to manage things when situations aren't fair. Is that about right? JUAN: So when can I move in? Master Clinician Note: Juan doesn't respond with \"yes,\" which shows that he's not yet committed to working on these issues. The cou nselor must reexplore the issues with Juan to identify which ones he 's ambivalent about. 70 How To Prepare a Client for a Conversation With a Parole Officer When your client agrees to contact his or her PO to explore options, help prepare as follows: If your client isn't ready for treatment yet, it's reasonable to expect him or her to leave if the PO says going back either to jail or to treatment is necessary. Discuss the consequences of leaving (e.g., the possibility of being remanded to jail) and tell your client that , no matter the outcome, he or she is welcome to come back for help in the future. If your client is ready for substance abuse treatment, you can indicate that sometimes, when pe o\u00ad ple agree to accept treatment and stay in it for a while, POs agree to remove the warrant. If parole concerns are a significant burden to your client, help him or her envision what it will be like to be rid of them . The PO might require substance abuse treatment or enforce jail time, but after, it will no longer be a concern. If needed, the two of you can work together on a plan for making it through treatment or jail time. Part 1, Chapter 2 COUNSELOR: Well, we went over a lot just now. We want to make the housing plan really work for you. Next, we'll review your application and get our agreement in place. You can have a little more time to think about what I just summarized as part of your plan. Tomorrow, let's r e\u00ad view the whole thing and make a housing plan we feel really good about \u2014one that will give you the best shot at making it stick with the landlord. Now , let's talk about contacting your par ole officer and get that sorted out. JUAN: Yeah, well, I'm outta here if the PO's got a warrant on me. [The counselor and Juan proceed to discuss what is going on between Juan and the PO. Juan and the counselor briefly role -play Juan talking to the PO.] COUNSELOR: Do you want to call him now, while I'm here? JUAN: That sounds okay. If he doesn't go along with this, then everything else is out. COUNSELOR: Right. We should talk with the PO first. We can use the speaker phone to hear both sides of the conver sation. We'll see how that goes, then decide about talking to the team about your plan. JUAN: Yeah, let's do that. COUNSELOR: Juan, I'll need you to sign this \"release of information\" form that authorizes me to talk with your PO and provide him with information about our work so far. Is that okay? J UAN: Okay, where do I sign? [The counselor helped Juan prepare for his meeting with the PO by using some of the guidelines noted in the how-to box above . Juan's PO determined that he could avoid incarceration if he stayed in the shelter for homeless services. Juan did move into the Housing First program, and he and the counselor continue to work on his multiple problems. Likewise, the counselor continues to work on engagement, helping Juan move from precontemplation to the contemplation stage with his substance abuse. The counselor, using MI methods, has helped Juan examine how hisambivalence and sensitivity often prevent him from initiating action s that co uld be helpful to him.] 71 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Summary Juan's story took place in the O&E phase. The work focused on: Establishing a trusting relationship through nonintrusive persistence. Identifying acceptable goals to work on. Maintaining teamwork among the counselor, Juan, and the interagency O&E team. Teamwork was central to Juan's willingness to talk to the counselor, see the apartment, regain a c\u00ad cess to the shelter (and thereby move toward housing), begin the application process, and explore his legal status. The counselor helped Juan move through the stages of change by prioritizing Juan's most i m\u00ad portant goals . Juan began in precontemplation for substance use and mental disorders and the contemplation stage for housing. Housing became the highest priority goal; this let the counselorand Juan identify barriers to maintaining stable housing and reasons to engage in other services.Juan is now in the action stage for obtaining housing and the contemplation stage for substance abuse, mental illness, and legal issues. Juan's personality problems, such as his hypersensitivity to criticism, his feelings that people are against him, and his sudden anger , may be his most challenging issues. They will be identified as concerns in his treatment after he becomes a bstinent , manages trauma disorder symptoms, and develops a resilient, trusting relationship with his treatment team. At this phase of homelessness rehabilitation, the clinician can address behavioral issues by: Demonstrating respect for and acceptance of h is feelings (e.g., anger, sense of unfairness). Helping him see how his behavior (e.g., hosting loud parties, leaving his job) contributes to his homelessness. Setting a goal of working on alternative responses to problem situations. Longer -term goals for this client will include: Creating a plan that Juan is confident he can accept and comply with for housing. Reconnecting him with family and other natural recovery supports. Working with treatment providers to engage him in substance abuse treatment. Recon necting him with employment and other meaningful roles in the community. Addressing his parole obligations. Evaluating him for mental disorders. Vignette 2 \u2014Francis Overview Francis is in the outreach and engagement phase of homelessness rehabilitation. This vignette demonstrates approaches and techniques for responding to his health and safety concerns. Francis is a 54 -year-old man who is chronically homeless and has limited interpersonal and inte l\u00ad lectual resources. He is now a loner and has had difficult y in the past maintaining a place to live. He currently lives in a subway tunnel, is suspicious of anyone who approaches him, and worries that the transit authority will put him out. He can be personable, and he often spends his day at the entrance to the subway . The outreach team has learned that Francis has occasionally gone to 72 Part 1, Chapter 2 the local community health center, which is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC; see the text box on p. 81), during the past 4 years. According to his clinic records , he has mild intel\u00ad lectual disabilities (intelligence quotient [ IQ] near 70) and may have cognitive impairments as a result of a head injury incurred many years ago. He receives a small disability check monthly. The money is managed by a designated payee, a person who is authorized to help Francis manage his money . He also receives Medicaid as a result of his disability. The program has been in contact with Francis for some time. He has always walked away afterinsisting that he is fine and doesn't need anything.The O&E team has new information from area shelters that he's building cooking fires in inappropriate places. In addition to his cognitiveimpairment, he has significant health problems, including diabetes and nutritional deficiencies.This informati on, along with an impending severe cold spell, mobilizes the O&E team to persist in trying to engage Francis in services. A team of two counselors plans to meet him, briefly assess his situation, offer material goods, and establish a relationship. Getting him to a ccept shelter, health care, and ongoing support are long \u00ad term goals. The present goals are to engage him in any possible way to improve his safety and tofind opportunities to offer other services. Maintaining the safety of O&E team members is a critical element of this type of work. Francis's location has been reviewed and approved as safe by the team. (Sample safety policies and proc e\u00ad dures are located in Part 2, Chapter 2.) Setting The counselor team is part of a multiservice organization serving homeless populations; its street outreach component is staffed by peer counselors, substance abuse specialists, psychiatric social workers, and consultant psychiatrists. It has a drop -in center, housing resources, a working agreement with a local FQHC , and ties to community homelessness programs. (Note: The designation of FQHC is based on specific funding and reimbursement criteria. There are a number of community health centers that may have an FQHC designation; however, there are other community health clinics and health centers that may not.) Learning Objectives Build rapport (offer material goods; engage in casual conversation; work at the client's pace; show empathy, respect, and genuineness) . Assess the severity of the client's problems (e.g., safety, health) and develop responses. Work with others as part of a team. Strategies and Techniques Outreach Match client and counselor Service coordination with a local health clinic, a Federally Qualified Health Center Counselor Skills and Attitudes Build rapport . 73 How To Engage People Who Are Living on the Street Several tools can help outreach workers engage a person who is living on the street: Observe from a distance to get a sense of what the person may need and how he or s he is doing. Approach respectfully. Ask to join the person at his/her bench, campsite, or other personal area. Offer safety -related items that h e or she appear s to need (e.g., food, shelter, blankets, water). Resist the temptation to offer items solely for comfort rather than safety , as this may support the client in refusing services. The goal is to develop an empathic relationship that respects the cl i\u00ad ent's wishes and creates opportunities to help the person become housed and enter treatment. Unless the individual indicates a willingness to have a longer conversation, keep your interactions brief (about 2 minutes) to avoid wearing out your welcome. Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Work collaboratively with the client and others. Recognize and accept the client as an active participant in prioritizing needs . Vignette Visit 1 (Francis's camp) During this visit, the team will: Initiate a relationship, begin to build trust, and establish rapport. Offer Francis food and a blanket. Tell Francis the weather is turning cold and offer to take him to a shelter. Assess Francis's condition. The two counselors slowly but casually approach Francis, who is seen lying down and snoozingamong some of his belongings. He's bearded, disheveled, dressed in dirty clothing, mildly mal o\u00ad dorous, and grimy. He is a large man, but he seems physically weak and malnourished. He awak\u00ad ens spontaneously as they approach but is unfocused and seems confused. Team members introduce themselves and shake Francis's hand. He doesn't know who they are and, fearing police or transit officials, he gets up, covers some items, picks up others, and begins moving away. COUNSELOR 1: Hey. FRANCIS: Hi. COUNSELOR 1: How are you doing? FRANCIS: I'm good. COUNSELOR 1: Good. My name is Alex, by the way. [gestures to colleague ] This is Tommy. [Francis acknowledges them minimally. ] We were just coming by here and noticed that you looked kind of down in the dumps a little bit. How are you doing? FRANCIS: I'm fine. COUNSELOR 1: Good. Did we startle you? FRANCIS: Are you the police? COUNSELOR 1: Oh no. We work down here in the tunnels and meet people who may be li v\u00ad ing down here or staying down here. Have you been down here for a while? 74 How To Work as a Team Member on an Outreach and Engagement Team Agencies often have p olicies supporting teamwork during outreach. Successful O&E teams collab o\u00ad rate on plans for outreach visits and respect each other's opinions. In Francis's case, the team agreed on the following: 1. O&E will proceed at the client's pace unless there is reason to fear that this will endanger the cl i\u00ad ent (see the decision tree on p. 77 ). 2. Specific problems will be addressed as the client is willing. Team members work together to cre\u00ad ate opportunities to offer assistance in resolving these problems. 3. Team members should define roles in advance, especially in terms of who will take primary r e\u00ad sponsibility for the interaction. 4. Team members should observe which worker the client prefers to speak with and respect that choice. Workers not speaking directly with the client will help in other ways by remaining alert to the needs of both the client and their colleagues. Part 1, Chapter 2 FRANCIS: Y eah. C OUNSELOR 1: What's your name, sir? FRANCIS: Francis. COUNSELOR 1: Hi, Francis. FRANCIS: Hi. COUNSELOR 1: It's ge tting kind of cold. Can I help you somehow? FRANCIS: No. COUNSELOR 1: Okay. Can we sit down? FRANCIS: Y eah. [After receiving permission to do so (it is Francis's \"home\"), the outreach workers sit down. This en courages Francis to stay and talk with them. He makes eye contact and start s to pay attention.] COUNSELOR 1: So how long you been staying down here? FRANCIS: Not long. COUNSELOR 1: Um, I was thinking that it's getting kind of cold out. You said that you were o kay. I just wanted to check and see if we could offer you a place to stay indoors. FRANCIS: No, I'm fine. I went to the health clinic. COUNSELOR 1: You did? Is that the one over on Second Avenue? FRANCIS: Y eah. COUNSELOR 1: I notice that your ankles look pretty swollen and red. Does that hurt? FRANCIS: A little, but not all the time. COUNSELOR 1: Is that what you went to the health clinic for? 75 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless [Counselor 2 suddenly notes that Francis is becoming uncomfortable, looking away and begi n\u00ad ning to pick at his clothes. The counselor assumes that his partner is being too directive with questions and, glancing at his partn er, decides to take another approach.] COUNSELOR 2: How are you doing in the food department? Can I offer you a sandwich? FRANCIS: Y eah. COUNSELOR 2: [ handing him a sandwich] Here you go. FRANCIS: Thanks. COUNSELOR 2: Sure. One of the reasons we are down here is that we're moving into a real cold spell over the next couple of days and, you know, when it gets cold, how do you usually ma n\u00ad age yourself? FRANCIS: [ making eye contact ] I'm fine. I have a bag. COUNSELOR 1: A sleeping bag, you mean? FRANCIS: Y eah. [Francis shows the counselor a warm sleeping bag in good condition.] COUNSELOR 2: Do you need anything else from us? Like a blanket, maybe? FRANCIS: Um ... sure. COUNSELOR 2: [ handing him a blanket] Here you go. FRANCIS: I'm through talking with you now. COUNSELOR 1: Okay, I'll tell you what \u2014we'll come back and see you another time. Can we do that? [Francis agrees , and the outreach team says goodbye and walks away. After the visit, the two counselors report to the rest of the O&E team (consisting of a psychiatrist, a social worker, peer counselors, and a substance abuse treatment provider) and discuss the temperature and whether to do something to ensure Francis's safety. They decide that his situation isn't that bad; he r e\u00ad sponde d appropriately to all questions, is sheltered from the weather, and has a good sleeping bag. They're concerned that he'll move now that he's been approached but decide that his camplooked well set up. That, coupled with his making eye contact and accepti ng food and a blanket, suggests that Francis will be in his camp the next day. They're concerned about his health and make a plan for the counselors to visit him frequently to monitor his general condition and the condition of his ankles, along with his ab ility to take care of himself in the cold. If the opportun i\u00ad ty arises, they'll try to look at his feet. They plan to engage him in medical and other services athis p ace and to take him some socks. The decision tree on the following page indicates how providers might decide whether and how to intervene when a person who is homeless declines services. ] 76 Decision Tree: Appropriate Follow -Up Care When Concerned About a Person Who Refuses Services When you detect a client problem in terms of health, cognition, possessions, inclement weather, or change in baseline, you must decide how to respond. In Francis' s case, the team decides to monitor him closely and seek opportunities to get him to medical services or bring the services to him. How did they make that de cision ? This decision tree maps out their process\u2014 the team's decisions are in bold. Part 1, Chapter 2 Visit 2 (Francis's camp) The next day, the O&E team members visit Francis again. Their goals are to: Offer him their business cards so he has a way to contact them. Offer him information about a new, smaller shelter that has opened up nearby. Make sure he knows that the weather is going to get even colder tonight. Observe his overall condition, the status of his feet, and his ability to take care of himself. Give him some socks. COUNSELOR 1: Francis? It's Alex and Tommy. Remember us from yesterday? 77 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless FRANCIS: Y eah. C OUNSELOR 1: Good. Man, it was cold last night! How did you do? FRANCIS: I did fine. COUNSELOR 1: I see you're fixing up a little bit more space for yourself here. FRANCIS: Y eah. [Francis attempts to stand and stumbles. He appears to be physically uncomfortable.] COUNSELOR 1: Can we give you a hand? FRANCIS: No, I'm fine. COUNSELOR 1: Okay. Hey listen, you know \u2014that shelter up on Avenue A has opened up and t here's a spot in case you need it, because it's getting really, really cold. Is that something we can help you with? FRANCIS: No. I'm fine. COUNSELOR 1: Okay. Well, we brought some socks for you ; would you like some socks? Master Clinician Note: Giving Francis socks is a nonverbal intervention that shows concern for his health and safety. It shows Francis that the team is connecting with his needs and is interested in building an alliance. FRANCIS: Y eah. Thanks. [ Tommy hands Francis the socks.] COUNSELOR 1: We'd also like to give you our cards in case you need to go to the shelter. We'll b e around. Is it okay if we come back and see you again? FRANCIS: Thanks. Yeah, you can come back. COUNSELOR 1: Okay. Good. Give us a call if you need to. There's an 800 number there. Feel f ree to just call that number if you need us. We'll come back and see how you're doing in a while, okay? FRANCIS: Okay. C OUNSELOR 1: There is a telephone right up at the top of the subway entrance, and this is an 800 number , so you don't need to use coins. You just dial this number. Is that okay with you? F RANCIS: Okay. Visit 3 (Francis's camp) On their third visit to Francis' s camp several days later, the O&E team has the following goals in mind: Continue to develop a relati onship with Francis. Introduce Francis to the idea of getting follow -up medical care. 78 Part 1, Chapter 2 Look for ways to connect him to housing opportunities. C OUNSELOR 1: Hey, Francis. FRANCIS: Hey, how you doin'? COUNSELOR 2: Hey, how you doing, Francis? FRANCIS: Good. COUNSELOR 1: I heard that you were in the shelter the other day. FRANCIS: Y eah. I was there for a couple of days. [Francis struggles to stand up \u2014even though he is obviously in some pain \u2014and he stumbles. The c ounselor reaches out his hand to help Francis stand and steady himself.] COUNSELOR 1: Let me give you a hand there. FRANCIS: Ow! I wen t to the clinic 'cause my foot was hurting a little bit, and they said I should g o to the shelter. Master Clinician Note: Francis has shown that if he really needs medical care and shelter, he can get them. This indicates that , despite some cognitive impairment, he uses good judgment in at least some situations. Cognitive impairment has a broad range of severity, from mild forgetfulness to full disorientation as to time, place, and person. Cog nitive impairment may also be temporary or chronic . Because thinking can become disordered or inefficient, cognitive difficulties can impair judgment by compromising a person's ability to evaluate the risks and benefits of a ny choice. The causes of cognitive impairment are many, but it may result from a head injury, malnutrition, alcoholism, or acute physical illness. The presence of clear cognitive impairment signals the need for a prompt medical evaluation. COUNSELOR 1: Ye ah, it looks pretty raw right down there. Looks really painful. F RANCIS: No, it really don't hurt that much. COUNSELOR 1: Really? I see that your shoes are in kinda bad shape too. So you've been walk\u00ad i ng around in shoes with holes in them, and it snowed th e night before last, too, didn't it? FRANCIS: Y eah. COUNSELOR 1: The weather must've been pretty bad on your foot. That's why you went to the clinic? FRANCIS: Y eah. COUNSELOR 1: Well, you know, Tommy and I were talking, and we were thinking you could pr obably use a better place to sleep at a certain point; you know, indoors, in an apartment. Is that something you might be interested in at some point in time? FRANCIS: Nah. I'm pretty fine out here. I mean, it's not too bad. COUNSELOR 1: But when it gets cold, it gets a bit rough, and right now it's kinda tough. 79 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless FRANCIS: I'm pretty much a tough guy. COUNSELOR 1: Yeah. I know. How long have you been staying outside? When was the last time you had your own place? F RANCIS: Oh, about 3 years ago. Yeah, me and my buddy got a place. I moved in. It was pretty n ice and everything. He kinda got sick a little bit. My friend passed away. COUNSELOR 1: Oh, he did? I'm sorry. FRANCIS: Y eah, it kinda was his place, so I couldn't stay there any longer. COUNSELOR 1: G ot it. You had trouble making ends meet and stuff like that after he passed. FRANCIS: Well, yeah. It was hard. COU NSELOR 1: Well, Francis, we 'd like to help you find some better housing if you are inter\u00ad est ed. FRANCIS: I'm fine. COUNSELOR 1: Okay. Well, it's something to think about, and we would be glad to talk more a bout it. FRANCIS: Okay. COUNSELOR 1: I'm a little concerned about your foot, though, especially the pain you're going thr ough. FRANCIS: It's not much pain. I've seen worse. [rubs his shoulder ] I was shot a long time ago. COUNSELOR 1: Oh really? Can you use that shoulder pretty good? FRANCIS: It's fine. Sometimes it hurts a little bit. COUNSELOR 1: Just so you know, at the clinic there's a nurse in charge of foot problems, and i f you'd like, we could take you down there to have her take a look at it if you want. FRANCIS: Y ou mean Miss Kate. I know her. She's nice. But I don't know. Like I said, it don 't hurt that much. C OUNSELOR 1: Okay. It's a little raw. I'm concerned about you with your shoes in bad shape a nd stuff. You know, at the clinic , they might be able to set you up with a new pair of shoes. FRANCIS: Can you get me some shoes? Master Clinician Note: This is the first request Francis has made of the O&E team, and they take this window of opportunity to let him know that they want to help him get what he needs. Offering concrete aid like this fosters engagement because it shows Francis that the team will respond to his manifest needs. Counselors will want to be sensitive to clients making a request as a test of whether the counselor and other members of the staff will really respond to the client's expressed needs. 80 What Is a Federally Qualified Health Center? A Federally Qualified Health Center is one that is qualified to receive Federal Medicare and Medicaid funds for delivering services to persons enrolled in those programs. In addition , an FQHC program may be eligible for grants to provide services to special target populations, such as individuals and families experiencing homelessness. Typically, FQHCs are found in areas that have large populations of medically underserved individuals and/or in areas with high concentrations of migrant and seasonal agricultural workers, significant numbers of people in public housing, or high rates of homelessness. FQHCs are located in every State. FQHCs are directed by a community -based board of directors and provide comprehensive primary health care regardless of a person's ability to pay. Fees are based on the individual's ability to pay. Additionally, many preventive services are offered, including screening, brief intervention, and refer\u00ad ral to t reatment (SBIRT ) for individuals at risk of substance abuse and substance use disorders. For more information, see https://www.cms.gov/MLNProducts/downloads/fqhcfactsheet.pdf . Part 1, Chapter 2 COUNSELOR 1: Yeah, we can bring you some shoes the next time we come. Would it be all right with you if I bring a worker from the clinic? They can help you get medical care for yourfeet. FRANCIS: Y eah. COUNSELOR 1: Okay, great. Take it easy, all right? By the way, what size shoes do you wear? FRANCIS: I don't know. Size 10 , I think. Okay, see you later. [The team will ask the FQHC clinic's homeless program case manager to join them on their next visit with Francis. They intend for the clinic staff person to become Francis's case manager and help him access medical care, possibly obtain permanent supportive housing, and access oth\u00ad er services. During the visit, the clinic case manager will take engagement and intervention cues from the O&E team. The team feels hopeful that they will get medical at tention for Francis's feet on their next visit. Francis has demonstrated that he'll go to the clinic when the pain becomes limiting, but the i m\u00ad mediate risk to Francis is that his feet are probably numb as a consequence of his diabetes. This creates a risk of injury and infection, which can lead to serious complications.] Visit 4 (Francis's camp) The team approaches this visit with the following goals and strategies in mind: The clinic case manager will accompany them and begin to establish a relationship with Francis. The team will offer Francis food, shoes, and a ride to the clinic, where he can have his footexamined. If Francis fears being coerced into unwanted services, they'll promise to return him to his camp. Francis is at his camp and is irritable. He didn't go to the shelter and is cold and obviously un\u00ad happy. The two counselors introduce the clinic case manager to him . COUNSELOR 1: Hey, Francis. 81 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless FRANCIS: Hey. C OUNSELOR 1: You know, I said we'd be back in a day or two, but we've been thinking about y our situation with your foot . We called up the clinic, and they were concerned. Let me introduce Jesse to you. CLINIC OUTREACH WORKER: Hi , Francis. Yeah, I've seen you come by the clinic a couple o f times. I think we spoke once. My office is just as you enter the clinic out of the waiting room, on the right. You know, we can help you with that foot, man. COUNSELOR 1: Yeah. We can take you to the clinic and then bring you back here if you want. CLINIC OUTREACH WORKER: Y eah, we can do that. You don't need to stay here. FRANCIS: I don't need no help. COUNSELOR 1: A nurse can look at that foot. FRANCIS: Did n't I just tell you I don't need no help? Master Clinician Note: The counselor appraises the situation and realizes that the introduction of another person with whom Francis has not had a chance to develop rapport and, possibly, the pressure Francis perceives about getting help are causing Francis to resist. Rather than provoke the resistance, the counselor takes the opportunity to change the topic and talk about the weather for a few minutes. He then returns to the discussion of Francis going to the clinic for health care. COUNSELOR 1: Well, man, I hope you are going to be willing to let Jesse help you get over to the clinic and get that foot taken care of. F RANCIS: That's all we're gonna do, right? CLINIC OUTREACH WORKER: Y eah. It's your call. Can we take your stuff with us? FRANCIS: Yeah. If you don't take things around here, they ... CLINIC OUTREACH WORKER: Y eah, I know. They get taken by somebody else. FRANCIS: So are we going to the clinic that I go to? C OUNSELOR 1: Ye ah, that's where the nurse is. She'll look at your foot and we'll get some food for you \u2014a sandwich and some hot coffee. How do you like your coffee? FRANCIS: All black. [On ce the team has promised not to leave him at the clinic, Francis agrees to go with the ou t\u00ad reach worker. He's now in the preparation stage for medical care and the precontemplation stage for assistance with housing.] Summary This vignette demonstrates counselor skills and attitudes involved in outreach work, including : Patience, respect for client autonomy, and trustworthiness. 82 Part 1, Chapter 2 Relationship -building skills. Ability to respond appropriately to changes in the client's behavior. Ability to work as a member of a team and respond appropriately to safety and medical needs. In the O&E phase, the team's interventions suited Francis's stages of change: contemplation andpreparation for medical treatment, and precontemplation for housing. They prioritized the goal most pressing to Francis and his well -being: addressing his medical problems. Interventions to build a relationship and increase readiness for services included: Asking for permission and respecting his decisions and personal space. Offering incentives (e.g., socks, blanket, shoes, food). Increasing access to services (e.g., bringing workers to him, helping with transportation,helping him take his things with him). Given Francis's willingness to engage on his terms , agreement to engage in additional services will also be on his terms. As shown in this vignette, Francis moves forward assisted by the creativity,care, respect, and persistence of the counselors who work with him. The challenge for the counse\u00adlors is to continuously balance Francis's freedom of choice with the severity of his condition. Long -term goals for working with Francis include: Help him engage in medical treatment at the clinic to stabilize his current medical cond i\u00ad tions. Evaluate his mental health, particularly i n light of his cognitive impairments. Make a plan that he's confident he can adhere to for housing. Reconnect him with his family and other recovery supports. Connect him with other peer -led community recovery supports. Vignette 3 \u2014Roxanne Overview Roxanne is in the intensive care phase of homelessness rehabilitation. This vignette demonstrates approaches and techniques for preventing homelessness and stabilizing a client who is in the pr e\u00ad contemplation stage of substance abuse treatment. Roxanne is 32 years old, has been diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder , and is possibly dependent on oxycodone and other opioids . She occasionally has sex in exchange for money and sells pain pills for income. Roxanne lives in a supportive housing program, but her b ehavior has put her housing at risk. Her hostility, impaired ability to regulate her emotions, physical co m\u00ad plaints, self -destructive and impulsive behavior, and impaired relationships may be indicative of a trauma -related disorder as well as a personality disorder. These behaviors may evoke an emotional reaction (countertransference) in the counselor, evi\u00ad denced in this case by the counselor's anger, frustration, and helplessness. This makes it hard for the counselor to respond effectively to Roxanne's need s. Supervision in such a situation is quite important and can help the counselor clarify boundaries, responsibilities, and strategies for hol d\u00ad ing Roxanne responsible for her behavior while providing support to facilitate behavior change. 83 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Roxanne's behavioral health counselor has talked to her many times about using drugs, br inging men paying for sex to her single room occupancy ( SRO ), and \"shopping for pills.\" Even so, Roxanne continues to have her clients \"visit\" her in her room. She also continues to seek drugs for severe chronic back pain \u2014particularly oxycodone \u2014in local emergency departments (EDs). She has been evaluated on several occasions for pain (including comprehensive studies of her back and spine in the hospital pain clinic), but no eviden ce of a physical disorder has been found. About 2 years ago, she was referred to the hospital pain management program but did not follow through with their recommendations. She has had two admissions to a local mental health treatment center, both times fo llowing arrests for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. T he clinic suggested that she might have posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or a su b\u00ad stance use disorder in addition to her personality disorder, but these diagnoses were not co n\u00ad firmed, and Roxanne refused to continue to be seen at the clinic. She did agree to enroll in a hospital case management program for ED users that includes consent to share information withthe behavioral health counselor in her SRO. The ED has called the counselor to report that Roxanne is now there and is refusing to leave without medication, even though she has been ex\u00adamined and released with a clean bill of health. Setting The behavioral health counselor provides case management services for a community program offering a variety of housing options to clients with a history of substance use disorders or SMI. All of the clients have had mental health and/or substance abuse treatment. The level of recovery varies from very stable to active symptoms that interfere with daily functioning. In most cases, a client 's level of recovery determines the housing options available to him or her. In this case , the counselor provides services to clients housed in an SRO supportive housing program fundedthrough the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ). The housing co n\u00ad sists of units with a kitchen and bath for occupancy by one person. Learning Objectives Tailor treatment strategies, including the use of incentives, to match the client's motivational level. Work w ith others as part of a team. Recognize situations in which supervision is appropriate. Work with clients experiencing homelessness who are in the precontemplation stage ofchange for their substance abuse. Strategies and Techniques Behavioral interventions, including contingency management Structuring sessions Managing and setting limits on inappropriate behavior Counselor Skills and Attitudes Work collaboratively with the client and others. Recognize and accept behavioral change as a multistep process. Take responsibility for personal and professional growth (e.g., address countertransference). 84 Part 1, Chapter 2 Adjust strategies to suit client characteristics (e.g., using a calm tone to convey safety and control when client s feel out of control , making lists of priorities to structure sessions). Vignette Visit 1 (hospital emergency department) Because Roxanne's behavior is sometimes inappropriate, two counselors go to the ED . Counselor 1 is Roxanne's assigned counselor. The counselors' goals for this meeting are to: Help Roxanne leave the ED before she is arrested. Set up an appointment for the next day to discuss her concerns. Transport her back to her SRO. Preserve their organization's relationship with the ED. They find Roxanne in the waiting area. When she se es the team arrive, she immediately begins insulting the ED staff, loudly complaining that no one is paying attention to her pain. ROXANNE: That b#*%! is ignoring me! Can't you see I'm in pain? My God! No one here cares about anybody but themselves, God #*%! it! Maybe you can help me. Tell them I'm in pain! I'm in pain!!! COUNSELOR 1: Roxanne ... ROXANNE: Thank God you're here! Oh my God, thank you. You gotta tell them I hurt! I'm hurting! My back hurts so much! They don't know what the #*%! they're doing her e! [Roxanne grabs Counselor 1's shirt. Caught off guard by this, the counselor turns his head away.] ROXANNE: Make them pay attention to me! Master Clinician Note: Given Roxanne's history and current behavior, it may be that she was not examined carefully . Barring any clear danger to the client, it is i m\u00ad portant to avoid confronting the ED staff with this possibility at this time. Issues about Roxanne's treatment in the ED can be carefully examined away from the ur\u00adgency of the moment. Moreover, Roxanne may further escalate her behavior if she senses disunity between the ED staff and her counselor. The team will address Roxanne's own behavior and desire for medication after leaving the ED, minimizing disruption and breach of privacy in the public waiting area . COUNSELOR 2: Roxanne, listen ... [ Counselor 2's calm tone and kind manner catch Roxanne's attention.] ROXANNE: No, I'm really hurting! You gotta get me some medication, pleeeease! You unde r\u00ad st and. I'm a woman. I have problems. You understand. Can you help me, please!! Please! My back really hurts!! COUNSELOR 2: Roxanne. Can you \u2014 ROXANNE: [ shouting ] Let's go to another hospital! I gotta do something! 85 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless COUNSELOR 2: [ calmly but firmly ] Can you go back to the chair, please? Listen, they called us and said they can't give you medication. We'd like to get you in the van and take you home. Master Clinician Note: Counselor 2's calm, firm tone communicates safety and co n\u00ad trol, and the simple instructions help Roxanne, who feels out of control, focus and calm down. There are no easy solutions to this situation. If Roxanne had not de\u00ad escalated, the counselor might next have opted to give her the choice of leaving the ED to d iscuss further options. She may have said, for example: \"You say you want to go to another hospital. Let's go outside , where we can speak more privately and discuss the options.\" The short walk may have allowed Roxanne to collect her thoughts away from an audience in the ED. The counselor's second option might have been to call security. Although always a potential tool for safety, using this op\u00ad tion too hastily may have resulted in a power struggle and led to Roxanne's physical restraint and sedation, the former being highly traumatizing and the latter uninte n\u00ad tionally colluding with her demand for medication. This would have reinforced her repeated inappropriate demands. As Roxanne engages in treatment, her providers will assess her trauma symptoms, develop an understanding of how her behavior helps her cope with these symptoms, and integrate this conceptualization into her treatment plan. [In a quick, nonverbal exchange, the two counselors agree that Counselor 2 will take the lead in interacting with Roxanne . Their training has prepared them for just such situations. They know that if both try to interact with Roxanne, it is likely to create an environment in which Roxanne can play one counselor against the other.] ROXANNE: What are we gonna do about this Go d #*%! pain?! That b#*%! isn't helping me. C OUNSELOR 2: We'll set up an appointment. Do you think you'll be ready for one tomorrow? ROXANNE: I want some meds. COUNSELOR 2: They aren't going to give you meds here. We already know they've made that de cision. ROXANNE: I hurt. I'm hurting. I'm really hurting! Please! Somebody help me, please! COUNSELOR 2: Tomorrow we're going to try and take care of it. Just let me \u2014 ROXANNE: Well, you better . I'm gonna sue somebody. I'm gonna sue that b#*%! over there! COU NSELOR 2: Forget them for now. You know the last couple of times we talked to you ab out some options, and we can do that again tomorrow. ROXANNE: I need something for this pain. Can you get me something tonight? COUNSELOR 2: I can't get you something toni ght. ROXANNE: What am I gonna do, then? COUNSELOR 2: We're going to get in the van, we'll take you home, and you can get some rest, tr y to sleep, and get a fresh start in the morning. All right? ROXANNE: What time? 86 How To Intervene With a Client Who Is Being Disruptive in a Public Place 1. Compassionate direction can help the client disengage from the situation and calm down. Speak calmly and firmly; give simple instructions (e.g., \"look at me,\" \"please sit down\"). 2. Get the client out of the public place. One way to shift the client's focus is to say, \"Your pain is important to us \u2014let's go somewhere where we can talk and make a plan to deal with it the best way we can.\" 3. You may be tempted to agree to unrealistic requests, like a meeting at 7 a.m. It's okay to set li m\u00ad its by saying, \"I'm not able to meet with you at 7, but I can meet with you at 8:30.\" 4. If you give in, one way to rectify it is to say, \"Look, I know we said 7. I was feeling your pain and lost my sense of what I'm really able to do tomorrow. I can't come any earlier than 8:30.\" Your client may not be pleased with waiting until 8:30, but you're modeling how to handle inappropr i\u00ad ate requests, and the client will appreciate that you are being cl ear about what you're able to do. Part 1, Chapter 2 COUNSELOR 2: You name it. ROXANNE: Sev en o'clock. [During the van ride back to her home, Roxanne tests more limits by insisting that she needs pain medication and taking off her seatbelt. The counselors stay composed, calmly tellingRoxanne that they'll pull over if she won't put on her seatbelt. They giv e her the option of getting aspirin at a drug store, which she accepts. As Roxanne begins to calm down, she throws a cup at acounselor. Both counselors stay calm, explain ing that her safety is important to them , so they can only transport her if she stops doing things like throwing cups. They say that they want to take her back home as long as she's willing to use her seatbelt and refrain from unsafe behavior.Roxanne agrees to accept the ride on those conditions.] Master Clinician Note: Reacting with harsh confrontation or a punishing tone to provocative behavior like Roxanne's is tempting. However, the counselors under\u00ad stand that her personality disorder along with possible PTSD make it very difficult for her to regulate her emotions and that it is importa nt to reinforce her sense of safety, control, and empowerment. Additionally, Roxanne has, in the past, often been successful in getting what she wants by escalating her disruptive behavior and becoming provocative. It is important that the counselors recog nize the provocation as an attempt to get her needs met and refuse to be manipulated by it. The couns e\u00ad lors believe that when Roxanne returns home, she'll buy pills on the street. They could say, \"I can see that you're really hurting and I'm worried that yo u'll do som e\u00ad thing that may put you at risk between now and tomorrow morning. Let's talk about options.\" The counselors know that this suggestion is unlikely to influence her i m\u00ad mediate choices, but planting the seed helps her develop alternative coping skil ls to manage her discomfort , and they convey their concern that she might use a mal a\u00ad daptive coping behavior. The counselors also recognize that some of the irritation, agitation, and pain that Roxanne is experiencing may be residual withdrawal sym p\u00ad toms. In subsequent visits, the counselor s will focus on helping Roxanne increase her motivation to obtain substance abuse treatment, return to the pain manag e\u00ad ment clinic , and develop coping options when her subjective experience of pain feels like it is becoming unmanageable. 87 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Visit 2 (counselor's office) Roxanne sleeps past her appointment, although the counselor has telephoned to wake her. When she finally arrives in the afternoon, she doesn't want to discuss her behavior at the ED, preferring instead to make demands on the counselor. The counselor's goals for this meeting are to: Reinforce the therapeutic relationship with Roxanne, particularly in light of their encounterin the ED the previous evening. Discuss her behavior at the clinic and her other options for pain management. Engage Roxanne in a screening process to assess for a possible substance use disorder. Help Roxanne understand the requirements of the SRO regarding drug use and visitors. Roxanne arrives with a list of complaints, including not having w ater last night and feeling back pain. In response to the counselor's attempt to focus on her behavior at the ED, she becomes even more upset. Master Clinician Note: The counselor agreed to meet Roxanne at an early hour. When she doesn't appear, he's angry. He also expects Roxanne to be erratic and provocative in today's session, possibly leading to a nonproductive or even contentious session. He needs to prepare for the session, first, by accepting his angry feelings and, second, by carefully preparing constructive responses (e.g., supportive limit setting, keeping goal expectations modest and prioritized) before the meeting. ROXANNE: I go 'cause I hurt and they ignored me last night! What are we gonna do about this water situation? I had to go out last night to get water, to take some more pills. There was no wa\u00adter. By the way, I got a letter today from public assistance telling me they're cutting off my ben e\u00ad fits. Nothing's happening! I don't understand. Somebody here did something. Somebody's got it in for me, I just know . Master Clinician Note: In almost every session, Roxanne has a pattern of raising multiple issues that seem unrelated. If the counselor begins to address one of these issues, Roxanne is likely to change the subject and move to another perceived problem. It is important for the counselor to identify the most pressing issues and help Roxanne stay focused on those issues. Some strategies the counselor could use include: 1. Assessing and p rioritizing problems to address. 2. Considering which problems, if effectively addressed, will ease the pressure of or resolve other problems. 3. Evaluating which problems Roxanne and the counselor can effectively address and which they cannot. 4. Deciding how complex problems can be broken down into several less complicated problems that can be addressed. COUNSELOR 2: They're concerned about your behavior at your building.The housing mana g\u00ad er called and said you're violating the visitor policy and getting into fights with your neighbor. I'm worried about your being able to stay there. If things keep going like this, I'm afraid you're going to lose your apartment. 88 How To Keep a Client Foc used When treating clients with many demands or problems, the following strategies may help: Limit session length at the outset ( e.g., \"we have only half an hour today\"). Create a list of the client's priorities to help you both maintain focus on treatmen t goals. Stay consistent from session to session. Stick with the treatment plan. Be firm but not rigid. Things will occur that dictate a need to change the treatment plan. Set goals that are realistic and can be accomplished in a timely manner. Identify realistic expectations for client behavior; recognize small successes as progress. Part 1, Chapter 2 [The counselor decides to focus on the housing issue with Roxanne because if she does lose her housing , it will be very difficult for her to maintain the gains she has made in other areas of fun c\u00ad tioning.] ROXANNE: I'm gonna lose my apartment if I don't get my #*%!ing benefits turned back on. COUNSELOR 2: Well, we don't want you to lose your apartment. So, the next time or maybe the time after when you come in, bring that paperwork for your benefits, and we'll see what you and I can do about you keeping your benefits. But Roxanne, we have to look at what is going on in your apartment. Maybe we can meet \u2014you, me, and the housing manager of your apartment \u2014 and see how we can resolve some of these problems. Do you think we could do that? ROXANNE: That's really not gonna do anything for my pain. My back hurts, and it hurts all the time! COUNSELOR 2: I agree ; your pain is difficult. I hope you can get back to the pain clinic at the hospital, but right now, let's see what we can work out about keeping your housing. ROXANNE: The only thing that helps is oxycodone . It really helps. Master Clinician Note: The counselor realizes that Roxanne is not prepared to focus on any one issue except getting her drugs and that continuing to pursue issues about housing or obtaining substance abuse assessment is going to be futile. He anticipates that continuing to press Roxann e at this time will only increase her alienation and escalate her complaints. He decides to forgo more discussion at this time and wraps up the session with a summary of their visit, reminding Roxanne to bring her benefits papers when she returns for the n ext visit. [This was a particularly challenging session for the counselor. Feeling overwhelmed by Roxanne's demands, the counselor knows he should seek supervision. The supervisor affirms the counselor's choice to seek assistance. His supervisor helps him assess Roxanne's problems and then structure sessions, assess Roxanne's readiness for change regarding her possible substance abuse, and iden\u00adtify appropriate interventions while also providing support for the counselor. The supervisor en\u00ad courages the counselor to continue to address the challenges of working with Roxanne insupervision. Some of the supervisor's suggestions and insights include: Support Roxanne's goal to keep her housing; this keeps the door open for her to accept ind i\u00ad cated treatment later. O ffer options , but don't take responsibility for her choices. She will make her own. Help Roxanne increase her motivation to obtain an evaluation for substance abuse treatment. 89 Trauma -Informed Care Trauma -informed care is an approach to working with clients who have histories of trauma that rec\u00ad ognizes trauma symptoms and integrates this information into treatment planning and delivery. Roxanne's counselors recognize that many of her behavioral symptoms may be a result of signi ficant trauma in her history, and they use that recognition in helping Roxanne develop a treatment and r e\u00ad covery plan that incorporates mental health, substance abuse, and trauma care along with housing. One key strategy of trauma -informed care is empower ment: helping the client take responsibility for his or her own recovery and life. Observe how the clinicians, in cooperation with the housing mana g\u00ad er, seek to empower Roxanne. For more information on trauma -informed care, see the SAMHSA - sponsored National C enter for Trauma -Informed Care W eb site ( http:// samhsa.gov/ nctic/ ) or consult the planned TIP, Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services (SAMHSA, planned h). Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Use contingency management (described later in this vignette) to help her engage and stay in treatment if it is indicated. Offer incentives she relates to (e.g., clothing vouchers) for meet\u00ading objectively measurable goals that are important to her (e.g., keeping her housing by b e\u00ad having appropriately in response to complaints, attendin g pain management for treatment of her back pain). This will help her develop internal motivation. Encourage Roxanne to develop coping skills for managing anger. If she becomes hostile, endthe session in a compassionate, noncombative way and see her again when she's able to speak calmly. Help Roxanne focus during sessions by making a list with her that includes her goals, such as getting help for her pain and addressing concerns about her apartment. Spend the last 15 minutes of every session reviewing the items covered during the session, keeping Roxanne focused on her list of goals and ways she can demonstrate that she has reached these goals. Reframe her behaviors as strengths. She is skilled at reading people, focused on her ownagenda, actively engaged in getting what she wants, and persistent. This will increase hersense of self -efficacy and help her see ways of shifting her behavior toward more adaptive outcomes. Continue noting countertransferential feelings in response to Roxanne's behaviors; seek su\u00ad pervision. ] Visit 3 (housing manager's office) After meeting with his supervisor, the counselor, with the cooperation of the housing manager ofRoxanne's apartment building, schedules a meeting with Roxanne, the housing manager, and himself. The manager has been confronted by other tenants who complain that Roxanne is loudand argumentative and may be using her apartment for prostitution. The housing manager notes that if Roxanne cannot be more coope rative , she is going to lose her apartment. The counselor wants to foster a spirit of teamwork, hear firsthand about the problems Roxanne is creating, and support the housing manager in working with Roxanne to reduce the risk of losingher apartment. The counselor's goals for this meeting are to: Assist Roxanne in keeping her apartment ; the counselor sees Roxanne's maintaining stable housing as a precondition to addressing other issues, such as pain management, substance use, and management of trauma sympt oms. Show Roxanne that her concerns are taken seriously. 90 Part 1, Chapter 2 How To Prepare for Joint Sessions 1. Support a spirit of teamwork among the staff members who are present: Create a tone that em\u00ad phasizes that everyone is working toward the same goal. 2. Use the first minutes of the session to set boundaries for the focus of the session, being clear about the issues that will be discussed. Every one comes to the session with a separate agenda, and things can get out of hand without clear agreement on session goals. Be sure all participants have an opportunity to state their goals. 3. Prepare all participants for the client's likely responses (e.g., coping styles): review the client's hi s\u00ad tory, current issues and goals, and past behaviors in similar circumstances. Create an environment that reinforces adaptive behavior. Show that the service team is unified in its approach to her problems. Address specific issues raised by a neighbor who has complain ed about Roxanne's behavior. T he counselor and the housing manager agree that the housing manager will take the lead in the meet ing. The counselor will step in to support Roxanne when she identifies positive changes she is willing to make regarding her housing situation. ROXANNE: Someone stole my public assistance stuff, and I'm sure it was her , because that b #*%! is just out to get me. She has nothing good to say about me. You've gotta take care of that! She slips nasty notes under my door and threatens me for some reason. She's just got it in for me, and I've just had it with her! HOUSING MANAGER: Well, she has some complaints about you too, Roxanne. R OXANNE: What have I done? HOUSING MANAGER: She says you're always having a lot of men over at your place. ROXANNE: [ sounding superior ] I'm allowed to entertain anybody I want. HOUSING MANAGER: Well, I ne ed you to do some things for me; I have a job to do, R oxanne. ROXANNE: You just do your job. HOUSING MANAGER: Well, you're going to have to help me do my job. ROXANNE: How? You're gonna pay me to do your job? HOUSING MANAGER: No, this is what I want you to do: Cut down on the traffic to your r oom. ROXANNE: There's nothing in the rules that says I can't have people there. I've read the rules. I know what they say. They don't say that I can't have people there. H OUSING MANAGER: I have ju st told you I've had complaints from your neighbors, so I'd be w illing to work with you if you're not going to \u2014 ROXANNE: She's just got it in for me. I'm not going to say one word to that b#!*%! But I tell ya, when I catch her stealing my mail, she's gone! 91 How To Manage Inappropriate Behavior When your client becomes inappropriately seductive and oversexualized with the staff: 1. Pause and identify for yourself what he or she is doing. 2. Consider how this behavior fits with your conceptualization of the client. Inappropriate behavior is part of chaotic relationships. 3. By stepping outside the chaos and observing what is going on, you can identify the seductiveness and label it as an issue to work on in treatment. 4. It is also important to kindly and firmly limit the inappropriate behavior. 5. Use structure (e.g ., a list of priorities) to help the client focus. Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless HOUSING MANAGER: Well, if you catch her stealing your mail, you should come tell me and I 'll make a police report. What's going on with your apartment? [Roxanne continues by listing a variety of problems with her apartment : a leaky bathtub, peeling paint, a problem with her refrigerator, a wall switch that isn't working, and a request for a new mailbox lock because she thinks her neighbor is stealing her mail. The housing manager listens carefully and takes notes of the items that need correcting. Although the housing manager does not commit to making all of the repairs immediately, he does seem to be listening carefully and taking her concerns seriously.] HOUSING MANAGER: Anything else? R OXANNE: Well, that's it for now. There's always something. But those are the worst now. HOUSING MANAGER: So you need a mailbox key, a refrigerator, a new paint job, and the tub fi xed. ROXANNE: When are you gonna do it? HOUSING MANAGER: What are you going to do for me? ROXANNE: What do you mean, what am I gonna do for you? I don't work for you! HOUSING MANAGER: What are you going to give me when I fix these things? ROXANNE: [ a bit sarcastically ] A \"Thank you very much.\" HOUSING MANAGER: Now, can I tell you what I want from you? ROXANNE: Something from me? I've got something. [ seductively ] You'll really enjoy it. HOUSING MANAGER: This is exactly what I'm talking about, Roxanne. This is not appropr i\u00ad a te. Let's talk about what we can do with the apartment. ROXANNE: But you said I was going to have to give you something, so you set me up. Master Clinician Note: The counselor steps in to interrupt the conflict and redirect the conversation and then steps back to let the housing manager take the lead once again. 92 Part 1, Chapter 2 COUNSELOR 2: Let's listen to what he would like to have you do. [ addressing the housing ma n\u00ad a ger] What is it that Roxanne can do to help with this? HOUSING MANAGER: The main thing that will help me speed up making the repairs is if you're willing to consider not having as many people over in one evening. ROXANNE: What do you mean, not as many people? C OUNSELOR 2: Limit her guests to just one or two in an evening? HOUSING MANAGER: Yeah. COUNSELOR 2: Can you do th at? ROXANNE: Yeah, I can do that. HOUSING MANAGER: Which of your apartment problems would you like me to address fi rst? ROXANNE: Uh, my refrigerator. HOUSING MANAGER: Yeah, I'm not saying I'm going to replace it. I'll replace it if it's not r epairable. ROXANNE: Okay. HOUSING MANAGER: And we'll take care of the tub. ROXANNE: Okay . What are you going to do about my neighbor, though? HOUSING MANAGER: I'm going to talk to her, and I'm going to ask her not to bother you. ROXANNE: You do that. I won't bother her , believe me. She's gotta stay away from my mail! COUNSELOR 2: If you think that she's in your mail, will you come to me and let me handle it? ROXANNE: Yes. COUNSELOR 2: Okay. So, can we go look at her refrigerator now? HOUSING MANAGER: Yeah, sure. [The housing manager leaves the meeting to get the repairman to work on Roxanne 's refriger a\u00ad t or. After his departure, the counselor spends a few minutes with Roxanne, supporting her for working toward resolving the problems. He also reinforces the need for R oxanne to limit visitors to her apartment and to bring complaints to the manager rather than confronting other residents directly. The counselor notes that during the entire meeting, Roxanne did not complain of pain or the need for pain pills. He d oes not mention this to Roxanne, but decide s to wait for Roxanne to raise the issue again. He schedules the next appointment with Roxanne for later in the week at his office. A fter returning to his office, the counselor calls the housing manager to express appreci ation for his skillful work in the meeting, thus building teamwork.] 93 How To Use Lists To Keep Clients Focused 1. Ask, \"What are the three most important things for you? It helps me to make a list of what's i m\u00ad portant.\" Lists create structure and help the counselor and client stay on the same page. 2. Help the client prioritize his or her most important concerns. 3. When the client veers off, the counselor can say, \"Well that's not on the list. Let's talk about your list because those are the most important things. If they aren't the most important, we can change the list.\" 4. Agree on the time needed for each i tem to increase structure. \"How long do you think we need to handle this item? Also, I need to speak with you about a few things, so I'll need 15 minutes at the end to talk about... \" Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Visit 4 (counselor's office) After another meeting with his supervisor, the counselor sets these goals for his next visit with Roxanne: Use a list to structure and prioritize the conversation. Help Roxanne accept medical treatment with Dr. Thomas, the program physician, who is associated with a local community health clinic. The counselor would like to use the visits with Dr. Thomas as an entry point for getting Roxanne to return to the p ain clinic at the hospital, hoping that pain management may be a way to engage her into addressing her sub\u00adstance use. Identify some strategies to help Roxanne move from the precontemplation stage to the co n\u00ad templation stage for addressing her substance use. Roxanne arrives late, looking exasperated and preoccupied. She apologizes for being late and b e\u00ad gins a rapid -fire complaint about her neighbor. The counselor helps her focus on making a list of priorities for them to work on. COUNSELOR 2: What I'd like to do is talk about the most important things for you right now. There are so many things going on. What's the most important thing for us to try to help you with right now? ROXANNE: What do you mean, \"help?\" I mean, there's all kinds of things going on. C OUNSELOR 2: Yes, there are a lot of things. Let's see if we can decide which are most i m\u00ad portant to focus on right now. ROXANNE: So, you want me to choose which is the most important thing? COUNSELOR 2: Yeah. ROXANNE: My back. COUNSELOR 2: Okay, so we want to concentrate on ... ROXANNE: The n my neighbor. COUNSELOR 2: Your neighbor? ROXANNE: My public assistance is still cut off. I got this leaky faucet. 94 Part 1, Chapter 2 COUNSELOR 2: So, there are four things. ROXANNE: I've got this guy after me \u2014I'm real worried about that. And my back. [The counselor and Roxanne settle on three issues to focus on today: her pain, the man who is after her, and relationships with other tenants at the SRO housing facility .] COUNSELOR 2: All right, so let's talk first about getting you an appointment with Dr. Thomas about your p ain. ROXANNE: I don't like him. COUNSELOR 2: He's the physician we can use in this program. ROXANNE: Can't you find me somebody else? Can't you find me a woman doctor? COUNSELOR 2: Sorry, we don't have a woman doctor. I understand that you would rather s ee a woman doctor, but Dr. Thomas is the only doctor assigned to this program. If you see Dr. Tho m\u00ad as and then still want to see another doctor who is female, I can see if we can arrange a referral. Master Clinician Note: The counselor thinks that Roxanne wants another physician because Dr. Thomas has not given her pain pills on past visits , but he is sensitive to the possibility that Roxanne may want to see a female physician because of a history of sexual traumatization. He doesn't explore that issue right now with Roxanne, but he makes a note to explore it in the future with her. ROXANNE: [ sighing ] Oh, all right. But he doesn't give me pills for my pain. C OUNSELOR 2: Roxanne, I understand that your pain is a real difficulty for you. But the drugs y ou want are very addictive, and I don't think you are going to find doctors who will consistently give you the drugs you want. ROXANNE: No, I need it. It takes away the pain . I'm not addicted to it. COUNSELOR 2: I know you don't think you are addicted. But we need to find some other ways t o manage your pain and your drug use. ROXANNE: Yes. I'm not addicted to it, I mean ... I just need something for the pain. I mean, look, if I can't get oxies, I'll buy something else off the street. C OUNSELOR 2: They help? ROXANNE: Yeah, because the pills take away the pain . Master Clinician Note: The counselor is preparing Roxanne to have modest but substantive expectations of the consultation with Dr. Thomas. By acknowledging Roxanne's pain and eliciting the relationship between Roxanne's pain and her drug - seeking behavior, the counselor enhances rapport and identifies one of Roxanne's needs. The counselor also demonstrates acceptance that Roxanne is in the preco n\u00ad templation stage of change for addressing her drug -seeking behavior and the co n\u00ad templation stage for exploring alternatives to oxycodone for managing her pain. 95 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless COUNSELOR 2: You can talk to Dr. Thomas about what you might do to manage the pain. You and he can make a plan for what you can do about the pain. [The counselor raises the issues of the man who is \"after\" Roxanne and her relationship with the other tenants in her housing, but Roxanne shows little interest in addressing either issue now.] Master Clinician Note: The counselor suspects that Roxanne's complaints have diminished as a result of her feeling understood and having her needs recognized. With another client at a more advanced stage of change, the counselor might ask if the client feels more comfortable or less distressed than when she came in, and then proceed to explore what happened to initiate the change. But with Roxanne, the counselor suspects this intervention might just invite Roxanne to begin focusing on all that is going wrong in her life and lead her to feel more agitated. [Roxanne lets the counselor schedule the appointment, and the counselor agrees to talk to Dr. Thomas about attending to Roxanne's concerns. He will also ask Dr. Thomas to consider talkingwith Roxanne about the pain management clinic and encourage her to accept a referral. Besides the meeting with Dr. Thomas, Roxanne agrees to continue to bring her concerns about the apartment to the housing manager and not the other residents. Roxanne has a letter from public assistance that she doesn't understand, so she will bring it with her when she goes to see Dr. Thomas , and the counselor can help her with it. This contingency makes it more likely that Roxanne will show up for her appointment.] Visit 5 (counselor's office) The counselor speaks with his supervisor about his countertransference with Roxanne and his concerns about forming a treatment contract. They agree on specific goals for the counselor's next visit with Roxanne, which include: Remain ing consistent with the list of priorities. Follow ing up on Roxanne's visit to Dr. Thomas. Develop ing a contingency management program for Roxanne that will support her contin u\u00ad ing in treatment and reinforcing changes she has made in pain reduction, drug use, interper\u00adsonal relati onships, and continuing in treatment. Expect ing Roxanne to present urgent issues and respond ing by maintaining a firm but flex i\u00ad ble focus on treatment goals. Help ing her form reasonable expectations of what can be accomplished; keep ing the list manageable. Roxanne reports that, as a result of seeing Dr. Thomas, she's scheduled for a magnetic resonance imaging scan ( MRI ) of her back and asks what an MRI is. The counselor explains, and Roxanne expresses disappointment that the doctor gave her no medication. She also agreed to schedule avisit to the pain clinic to re enter the pain management program , part of which is a comprehensive evaluation for substance abuse, brief intervention, and referral for treatment, if needed. ROXANNE: I'm really pissed off 'cause I'm still hurting, and he didn't give me anything. COUNSELOR 2: Well, I'm really impressed by the fact that you're hurting and yet you came to meet with me, and you worked to get some things done in the apartment. 96 Part 1, Chapter 2 ROXANNE: My bathtub still isn't fixed. COUNSELOR 2: Some things are taken care of. ROXANNE: Yeah, he gave me a new key. I got that. C OUNSELOR 2: Good. I think when you focus, you get things done and people respond to y ou. That is a real strength that you have. Master Clinician Note: This in tervention identifies and positively reinforces Roxanne's adaptive behavior, thus building her self -confidence and esteem. ROXANNE: I guess... people just keep bothering me. COUNSELOR 2: Well, look. I read over your letter from public assistance. It's just a confirm a\u00ad tion of your status. Your status hasn't changed. I can be a witness to that. R OXANNE: What happened? COUNSELOR 2: It's just a routine evaluation to see whether you're eligible to have continued a ssistance. You have to sign this to confirm it an d I can sign off on it. ROXANNE: [ after reading the document ] Where do I sign? COUNSELOR 2: Right here. [ Roxanne signs the document. ] Good. I'll sign as a witness. ROXANNE: Can I get a copy of that? COUNSELOR 2: Absolutely. So, you've shown up for the appointments with the housing ma n\u00ad ag er and Dr. Thomas, and you brought your letter as I asked, so I think you're really making some progress here. ROXANNE: My pain is still there, though. Master Clinician Note: The counselor is participating in a pilot program in the agency to use a newly developed cognitive -behavioral strategy, contingency management, with a few selected clients. Contingency management reinforces positive behaviors toward treatment goals by rewarding the client with vouchers for items that most people would like. Rewards might include special recognitions or program benefits, such as a dditional hours away from the treatment program. The rewards need to be tied to specific , identifiable, clearly measurable goals, such as clean drug screens, attendance at self -help meetings, and consistent treatment program attendance. Contingency management is generally implemented in settings with a number of clients participating. In this vignette, contingency management is used with just one client. Contingency management is often used in concert with cognitive -behavioral therapy. For more information on contingency management, refer to SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence -Based Programs and Practices ( NREPP). Contingency management is also a term sometimes used in housing services, where contingencies, such as staying abstinent , are a condition for housing. 97 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless [The counselor briefly explains the contingency management program to Roxanne in terms of rewarding positive, objectively measurable steps toward treatment goals. Roxanne seems quite interested in obtaining vouchers or coupons for products that she might not otherwise be able to purchase.] COUNSELOR 2: I want to give you a coupon because you kept your appointments with the doctor and the housing manager. I've got a voucher that will get you a free hair appoi ntment. How would you like that? ROXANNE: I'd like that. Thank you. COUNSELOR 2: Okay. Next week, if you keep doing well and I get no calls from the housing manager or from the ED, you'll get a voucher for Interfaith Clothing Closet to get some outfits. How's that sound? ROXANNE: Now what do I have to do? COUNSELOR 2: I don't get any calls that you've been into the ED. ROXANNE: What if I'm sick? COUNSELOR 2: Well, you're working with Dr. Thomas. You're having an MRI next week, so we have a plan that yo u're working on. If you get sick in the meantime, call Dr. Thomas. ROXANNE: What if I have a pain in my back again, like a stabbing pain, and I can't stand it anymore and it's , like, in the middle of the night , and Dr. Thomas is not available? COUNSELOR 2 : If something happens and you have an emergency, then you can go to the emergency room. But if you're going to ask for oxycodone, that wouldn't be following our agre e\u00ad ment. ROXANNE: So I can go to the emergency room, but I can't ask for any pills? COUNSEL OR 2: Right. ROXANNE: Okay. [The counselor educates Roxanne about how stress and pain are related, and how there may be other ways to address the pain that may be more helpful than pills. Roxanne refuses to considergoing to the pain clinic and steers the conversation back to the emergency department.] ROXANNE: [ dismissive ] Well, I just know what's gonna happen. I'm gonna wake up in the mi d\u00ad dle of the night , and I'm gonna be in pain , and I'm not gonna be able to go back to sleep , and I'm not gonna be able to get help because you're telling me I can't go to the emergency room and get some oxies. COUNSELOR 2: I didn't say you couldn't go to the ED. I said it's not consistent with our agreement if you go to the ED and try to get oxy codone. ROXANNE: I'm gonna go to the emergency room to get some relief or something. 98 Part 1, Chapter 2 COUNSELOR 2: So that will be our understanding. If the ED tells me you were requesting oxycodone again, I won't give you the voucher for the Clothing Closet. Do we agree about the voucher and the ED? ROXANNE: [ tolerant ] I suppose. COUNSELOR 2: Okay. Well, I think we have everything set up. Now, I'd like for us to put our agreement in writing. Would you like to have that? I promised you a voucher for the ClothingCloset. You could go there and pick two outfits, but in return, the understanding is that you won 't go to the ED and ask for oxycodone , and you 'll follow through with your appointment with Dr. Thomas next week. ROXANNE: [ a little confrontational] And if I don't sign? COUNSELOR 2: We won't have an agreement, and you won't get a chance to get a couple of new outfits. This is how we both understand what we're agreeing to. What have you got to lose? [Roxanne challenges the counselor; his calm response enables her to go along with the plan.] ROXANNE: Can I get some shoes with that? COUNSELOR 2: I don't know whether they have shoes, but the voucher gets you a couple of outfits. If the outfits include shoes, you could look at shoes. ROXANNE: Okay. Master Clinician Not e: Committing the plan to paper is a good idea for Roxanne; she'll have it to help her remember what she is supposed to do in order to get the clothing voucher. It also assures her that as long as she follows through, the counselor will, too. Some clients may not need written cues, but when structure and/or ability to remember details are issues for clients, it is a good idea to put agreements in writing. Summary The counselor now has the tools to respond effectively when Roxanne is demanding and chaotic. He understands that he can't realistically meet all her needs and doesn't have to. Clinical superv i\u00ad sion helped him become aware of his countertransference (i.e., feeling angry, weary, manipulated, challenged, and provoked) and develop ways to manage it so he can respond to Roxanne calmly yet firmly. This approach helps her form a plan to keep her housing, address her back pain, and consider alternatives to oxycodon e. When Roxanne was in the ED, she was in the precontemplation stage of change for finding a l\u00ad ternative ways to manage pain, substance use, high -risk behavior, provocative behavior, and hou s\u00ad ing problems. The counselor's respectful and empowering intensive -care approach (goal setting and reinforcement of appropriate behaviors) has moved Roxanne into the preparation stage foralternatives to managing pain and the action stage for keeping her home and changing problembehaviors. As she succeeds in managing pain and maintaining housing, she may be more mot i\u00ad vated to engage in substance abuse treatment. 99 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Long -term goals for working with Roxanne include: Continu ing to support and reinforce behavior that allows her to maintain her housing. Continu ing to pursue pain management. Obtain ing treatment for her substance use, if warranted. Increas ing motivation to engage in services by exploring and resolving ambivalence; creat ing a plan that she is confident she can make work. Connecting her with acceptable recovery supports (e.g., mutual support groups, faith -based supports). Vignette 4 \u2014Troy Overview Troy is in the intensive care phase of homelessness rehabilitation. This vignette demonstrates a p\u00ad proaches and techniques for preventing homelessness and engaging the client in substance abuse treatment. Troy is a 32 -year-old single father who is dependent on alcohol and marijuana. He had one brief episode of homelessness in his early twenties, was in substance abuse treatment 2 years ago, and attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) regularly until about a year ago. He relapsed about 6months ago and lost his roofing job. Until his relapse, he had been abstinent for 18 months. The relapse seems to have been triggered by his wife leaving the family, financial difficulties, anddropping out of AA. He says he quit attending AA because he could not arrange child care forhis sons, ages 6 and 8. He got custody of his children 8 months ago , after his wife left. He lacks good childcare, paren ting, and time management skills and is e asily overwhelmed. When he becomes overwhelmed, he tends to \"shut down\" and withdraw from others, which i n\u00ad creases the environmental stressors. He has food stamps and public assistance but can't cover his rent. Troy has a Section 8 voucher and is afraid tha t he is about to lose his apartment. For more information on Section 8 housing assistance, see the note on page 103. S ome of the stress -related symptoms he currently experiences include: Difficulty staying focused on one issue; when he tries to focus on one issue, he tends to b e\u00ad come overwhelmed. Lack of energy and no desire to take on problems that really need to be addressed. Difficulty remembering things, which leads to missed appointments. Feeling like he has so many problems that he doesn't know wher e to start. Troy remembered that his old behavioral health counselor was very helpful to him, so he called tosee if the counselor could help him with his housing. Setting The counselor works in a community -based, multiservice substance abuse treatment or ganiza\u00ad tion. Some of the program staff members specialize in housing and employment assistance. Learning Objectives Adapt counseling strategies to unique client characteristics and circumstances. 100 Part 1, Chapter 2 Coordinate treatment and prevention activit ies and resources that suit client needs and pre f\u00ad erences. Understand the interaction of co -occurring substance use and mental disorders with hom e\u00ad lessness. Work with others as part of a team. Strategies and Techniques Homelessness prevention Cognitive restructuring Working with persons who have co-occurring substance use and mental disorders and are homeless Interventions for substance abuse relapse Counselor Skills and Attitudes Assess basic life skills and functioning. Recognize and address underlying issues that may impede treatment progress. Respond appropriately to the client's environmental stressors, employment situation , and childcare responsibilities. Accept relapse as an opportunity for positive change. Vignette Visit 1 (counselor's office) The counselor has not seen Troy for 10 months and begins the first session with the following goals : Reestablish the working relationship. Identify the concerns that have prompted Troy to seek treatment. Understand the circumstances for Troy's relapse. Troy arrives at the session looking down in the dumps, tired, and distracted. His speech is soft , and he is slow to respond to the counselor's questions. He appears to be having difficulty concen\u00adtrating. COUNSELOR: Tell me about why you wanted to see me. TROY: Well, I dunno. Because I'm using a lot of weed and stuff. I been using it for a while; a lot of stuff 's going down. I'm behind on the rent and it's really hard to keep up. It takes the edge off, you know? COUNSELOR: Last time you were in, we spoke of coping with stress. Have you been using those skills? TROY: A little bit. I've been trying to keep up with my kids and stuff. COUNSELOR: All right. TROY: I put the kids to bed at 9, and it's my time after that, you know. 101 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless COUNSELOR: Around what time do you go to bed? TROY: It depends. Midnight, 1 o'clock. Sometimes the guys are over and we stay up a little bit late, you know, smoke a little, drink a little. But I'm so tired when I get up in the morning. COUNSELOR: You're really tired in the morning. TROY: [ affect is somewhat flat] I have to get them to school. It's good that I do that, you know? Then I go home and ... I messed up a couple months ago. I go to sleep sometimes after I drop them off , and I didn't show up to work , and now it don't even matter to me if I work. I got enough with the boys. [Troy and the counselor spend a few minutes talking about his wife abandoning the family, his dropping out of AA, his relapse, and the loss of his job. Troy thinks his most pressing problem right now is the possibility of losing his home.] COUNSELOR: Y eah, having children can be challenging \u2014it's a new life that you have, right? TROY: Yeah, I guess so. It just gets the better of me. I didn't know it was going to be like this. COUNSELOR: I remember when you were in treatment ; we talked in g roup one night about your fear that your wife might leave if you got clean . As I recall, you thought you were definitely the better parent for the boys and that, if she left, if you got c ustody of them, it might be good for everyone. Master Clinician Note: The counselor empathizes with the challenges of single parenthood and reminds Troy how proud and excited he was to get his boys. This helps Troy to decrease negative self -assessment and increase his confidence in his ability to make a change. A key treat ment effort in early recovery i s to help clients increase self -esteem, improve self-confidence , and learn to evaluate the impact of their actions before they act. TROY: Maybe. I just gotta get back to my house to just see the kids, I dunno. C OUNSELOR: Where are your kids now? In school? TROY: They should be getting home any minute. I gotta leave here in just a few minutes. COUNSELOR: Okay. I can see that you are under pressure to be there when they get home. Ca n you give me at least 5 minutes? Let's list what we talked about. You're worried about losing y our apartment, it's hard managing the kids, and you've relapsed \u2014is that correct? TROY: Yeah, like, it's just not happening for me now. Sometimes I guess I get to the point where I just say, #*%! it. And, maybe that's why I smoke and I been drinkin'. Master Clinician Note: The counselor empathically reflects Troy feeling overwhelmed, letting Troy open up more about feelings of hopelessness, irritability, and the role of substance abuse. Taking time to ga ther more information and develop rapport with the client before work ing on the problems the client and counselor have identified decreases client resistance to change. 102 How To Work With a Client Who Is Overwhelmed Once you recognize that your client is overwhelmed with life problems or with the information you've shared in a counseling session, change your expectations for what you can accomplish in session s until he or she is doing better: 1. Keep your sessions short (15 -30 minutes). 2. Don't overload t he client with information or tasks. Have realistic expectations based on the cl i\u00ad ent's abilities. 3. Keep the information you provide brief; speak in simple, short sentences. 4. Offer assistance with accomplishing a task if the client isn't able to do it independently. 5. Create a list of urgent, important tasks; work to address those as the client is able. 6. Schedule brief sessions often during the week until the urgent, important tasks are done. 7. Monitor the client's body language, facial expressions, and responses for signs of overload. Offer to take a break or offer water to help the client be able to continue and feel understood. A Note on Section 8 Housing Section 8 Housing is a voucher program funded by HUD. It assists very low income families in obtai n\u00ad ing decent and safe housing in the private housing market. Once they are deemed eligible, partic i\u00ad pants find their own rental housing in their communities. HUD (through its designee in each State) then pays the landlord the difference between a specific amount (generally 30 percent of the of the tenant's adjusted income) and the fair market rent of the housing unit. Eligibility for participation is determined by the household's gross income, which generally may not exceed 50 percent of the m e\u00ad dian income of the county in which the family resides. Special programs are available for families with disabilities and to reunify families with children placed in foster care due to inadequate family hous\u00ad ing. Involvement in drug -related or violent criminal activity is grounds for loss of Section 8 housing. S ource: HUD, n.d. Part 1, Chapter 2 COUNSELOR: So let's put that on the list of things we need to work on : the drinking and the weed, getting back into your AA program. We need to look into some emergency housing sup\u00ad port until you can get back on your feet. Do you have any income now? T ROY: My brother sometimes has a little work for me; he's a contractor. But , you know, nobody i s working in construction these days. So I hardly get enough to feed us. COUNSELOR: Okay . Do you agree that these are the things we need to work on first: getting clean, going back to AA, getting you emergency housing support, and getting back to work? TROY: Yeah. Well, I really gotta get out of here. COUNSELOR: So, real quick, did you talk to your Section 8 representative? TROY: Uh ...nah. C OUNSELOR: Okay. Here's the rep resentative 's name and number; call her and say that you lo st your job. They'll recertify your income, which will lower the rent you have to pay. [ The cou n\u00ad selor writes down Sherri's phone number and a note reminding Troy to explain that he's lost his job. ] She'll be there until 6 tonight. TROY: Uh -huh. C OUNSELOR: We can work together to help ensure that you won't lose your home. I have an 103 How To Handle Late -Shows and Missed Appointments How you address late -shows and missed appointments depends in part on the client's ability to plan and organize sufficiently to arrive on time: 1. If this is the client's first late- show or no-show, consider whether memory or concentration prob\u00ad lems may exist that make it difficult for the client to remember appointments and arrive on time. 2. In the absence of cognitive problems, explain the importance of punctuality. Don't take the client into your office to negotiate; don't go out of your way to extend session time or reschedule (r e\u00ad move positive reinforcement). You may also give the client an appointment card, express regret that the client missed the appointment, and focus on what will be accomplished in the next visit. 3. If the client has cognitive problems, ask him or her to explain the tardiness and schedule another appointment. Don't take the client into your office to negotiate. Offer an appointment card to be kept in a wallet, or suggest pu tting it on the refrigerator. 4. If this is not the client's first late -show or missed appointment, and the client is tentatively e n\u00ad gaged in services (e.g., client is chronically homeless, client 's willingness to engage in services is itself a significant acc omplishment), it may be unrealistic to expect punctuality. One effective a p\u00ad proach that reinforces showing up is to allow the client to walk in and wait for the next available appointment. 5. If the client has been late or missed other appointments, but has shown the ability to be on time , then lateness or missed appointments may be a way of demonstrating ambivalence about the counseling process. Explore this briefly, as he or she walks in or calls, to enhance the relationship and make the client more likely to return. You can also express regret that the client missed the meeting and focus on what will be accomplished in the next visit. Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless appointment available tomorrow at 11:30 if you'd like to come back. TROY: I'll come tomorrow. Master Clinician Note: Troy has made some progress on his own getting food stamps, public assistance, and setting up an appointment for the visit today. The counselor recognizes these steps as strengths and hopes to build on Troy's ability to mobilize to get him back to AA and to help him focus on staying abstinent , developing stronger parenting skills, and get ting a job. If the counselor gives him too much to do, Troy will feel overwhelmed and spiral downward, so he doesn't push these issues in the first visit. The two most pressing problems \u2014from the counselor's perspective \u2014are helping Troy regain abstinence and maintain his housing. Without abstinence , it will be challenging for Troy to attain the other goals of improving his parenting skills and getting a stable job. Without stable housing, the counselor suspects it will be difficult for Troy to maintain abstinence. He is also concerned about Troy's level of depression and decides to talk with him on his next visit about consulting with the staff psychiatrist. [After the first meeting with Troy, the counselor follows up with the Section 8 staff, explaining Troy's concern about losing his housing due to unemployment and mentioning that Troy now has custody of his boys.The counselor and the Section 8 representative agree to work together to help Troy recertify his current rent, access a local rental assistance program to help pay his back rent, and engage in substance abuse treatment.] Visit 2 (hallway outside counselor's office) Troy doesn't make his 11:30 a.m. session, but shows up later on in the lobby. The counselor is b e\u00ad tween sessions with clients, so he talks to Troy in the hallway for a couple of minutes. Troy vaguely 104 Part 1, Chapter 2 remembered that he had a n appointment but wasn't sure what time it was supposed to be\u2014 another indication of his difficulty with memory and his in ability to focus. The counselor says there's an opening at 2:00 p.m. if he wants to wait. Troy agrees, and the counselor asks if he cal led the Section 8 representative. Troy hasn't, so he tells him to ask the receptionist to let him call while he's waiting. Troy finds it helpful to have this specific task to do while he's waiting. The counselor meets with Troy at 2:00 p.m., but Troy announces that he can stay for only 15 minutes because he has to get his kids. The counselor's goals for these 15 minutes are to: Verify that Troy called the Section 8 staff and is no longer at immediate risk of losing his housing. Focus on connecting Troy wit h resources for getting clean and sober. Get Troy's cooperation in scheduling a psychiatric consultation. COUNSELOR: So, what did Sherri say? TROY: Sherri said it's all right. She gave me some information about a program I could contact for help paying the back rent. She did mention something about wanting me to stay in treatment, though. COUNSELOR: Right. She said that you need to show that you're working on a plan for absti\u00ad nence that'll help you keep your housing. You did a great job working with her; you must feel pretty good about that. TROY: Yeah, okay. COUNSELOR: So that piece is taken care of. There are a couple of things I want to talk to you about. First, I need you here on time for our meetings. We were scheduled for 11:30 today. Master Clinician Note: In situations when a counselor must rapidly change gears and abridge the content of the session (starting late and/or ending early), it is necessary to select simple priorities that can be accomplished in the time allowed. It is important to be clea r with the client that the agenda is reduced specifically because of time constraints. TROY: Well, you know, I got the kids to school, came back, had some stuff to do . I was tired. C OUNSELOR: What kind of stuff did you have to do? TROY: I needed to sort of catch up on some sleep, and then I had some business to do. COUNSELOR: You're sleeping more in the daytime. TROY: You know, I've been sleeping a good bit. I gotta catch up on it sometime. COUNSELOR: Sounds like you're exhausted. It's hard to get things done with a lot on your p late. TROY: Uh -huh. I got a call from Jimmy's teacher. He's been getting to school late and they're talking about some meeting. She mentioned calling child welfare, a nd I gotta get out of here to pick them up. They get out at 2:45. 105 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless COUNSELOR: You sound worried. You're starting to get your life back together and be a good parent, and I can see you're very concerned about getting them on time. Can we spend 5 minutes going over a few things, and we'll get you out of here? I want to get back to that child welfare issue for just a minute. TROY: Okay. COUNSELOR: Okay. Well, we've got to make sure you keep your housing. That's a big pr iority. The other thing I think is important is your getting clean again. TROY: Uh -huh. Well, I haven't used now in a couple of days. I haven't slept worth a damn, but other than that, it hasn't been too hard. COUNSELOR: Okay. What do you need to keep on staying clean ? TROY: Well, I just need to keep on. I'll keep on seeing you, if you want. I gotta keep people out of the house after the boys go to bed. That's when it gets lonely, and I'm tired , and people drop over. COUNSELOR: I want us to talk more about this, but I know you need to leave in just a minute , so I want to get back to the child welfare issue. When do you meet with the teacher? Master Clinician Note: The counselor would like to continue solving problems and building strengths with Troy to help him stay abstinent , but he recognizes that Troy has only a few more minutes left. He wants to return to the issue Troy raised of child welfare being contacted about his kids. The counselor also decides to for go the issue of psychiatric consultation. He doe sn't want to raise another issue, which might overload Troy. He respect s Troy's need to get to the school on time and doesn't want to end the session on a possibly contentious note, should Troy decline to get the psychiatric consultation. TROY: [ seems frig htened ] Well, I guess 3 o'clock. I don't know what's going to happen. COUNSELOR: You seem kind of frightened about what that meeting is about. TROY: Yeah. COUNSELOR: She may discuss the importance of them arriving on time or other things. I'll support you as much as I can. Call me if you want to talk about the meeting before our next se s\u00ad sion. TROY: Okay. Visit 3 ( counselor's office) The counselor has the following goals for this session with Troy: Have Troy accept a referral to the staff psychiatrist for evaluation of potential depression. Support Troy's abstinence and help him build strengths to continue to stay clean. Support Troy in taking action on behalf of his sons \u2014for instance, by attending meetings at the school. 106 Working W ith Clients Who Are Homeless and Have Co -Occurring Disorders A wide range of substance use and mental disorders can co -occur with homelessness. In most cases, homelessness makes treatment of and recovery from mental and substance use disorders more pro b\u00ad lematic, and the co -occurrence of substance use and mental disorders limits the person's ability to address critical life problems such as homelessness. It is imperative to treat all three conditions \u2014 substance use disorders, mental illness, and homelessness \u2014concurrently using an integrated a p\u00ad proach. For more information on the impact of CODs and homelessness, see SAMHSA's Homeles s\u00ad ness Resource site isorders 457.aspx ) CODs (http://www.samhsa.gov/co -occurring/ ). In the following sessions, observe how the counselor and Troy work together to obtain a psyc hiatric evaluation of Troy's depression, implement treatment for this condition, support his recent absti\u00ad nence, continue his attendance at AA, and help him maintain secure permanent housing through the Section 8 housing program. How To Manage the Stress of Seeing Clients Who Have Multiple Problems Counselors have many responsibilities during and between sessions. It's frustrating to work with a client who has urgent problems and fails to show up for appointments or follow through with assig n\u00ad ments. It's even more stressful when children are involved. How do you address these needs and avoid burnout? 1. Know the system and resources currently available in your area. 2. Help the client get access to these resources quickly. 3. Remember that you help clients handle urgent and important issues, but you're not responsible for their choices. 4. Resist the urge to rescue the client from his or her emergency and/or feelings of being over\u00ad whelmed ; attempt to respond concretely to what is presented as an urgent need. 5. Remember that helping the client prioritize multiple needs is an important part of the work. Help the client create a list of the urgent, important things that need to be done and prioritize them. 6. Identify teammates who should be brought in (e.g., psychiatrist, Section 8 representative , child\u00ad care specialist). 7. Seek supervision frequently. Part 1, Chapter 2 Troy arrives for the session on time. He still feels overwhelmed, very tired, and doesn't have much motivation to look for a job, but now has 7 consecutive days of abstinence . The session begins with Troy describing the meeting with the teacher and assistant principal of the school. The school authorities had not contacted child welfare but stressed that if the boys continued to act out at school and didn't arrive on time, the y would have to take some action on behalf of the boys. The counselor supports Troy in staying clean and in addressing the needs of his sons. The counselor then decides to raise the issue of the psychiatric consult ation to rule out depression. COUNSELOR: T roy, I'm concerned that you seem tired all the time, overwhelmed, don't have much energy for doing things, and are having trouble concentrating. I think it would be good ifwe could get some consultation on whether or not you are depressed, and if so, what we can do about it. So, I'm wondering if we could schedule an appointment for you with Dr. Moore, ourpsychiatrist, to have you checked out for depression. TROY: [ seems a bit helpless in attitude ] Yeah, I don't know. I don't wanna go see Dr. Moore. A friend of mine, when she went to see the psychiatrist, they took away her kids. \u00ad 107 How To Use Assignments Between Sessions Assignments between sessions are a useful tool in counseling. They help learning carry over f rom the session into daily life and put what has been talked about in the session into action. Assignments also make change a part not just of counseling, but of everyday life, and they keep change as an \" up front\" activity in the client's mind. When giving assignments, it is useful to: 1. Make sure the tasks are attainable in the time period of the assignment and, to the extent poss i\u00ad ble, can be repeated several times during the assignment period. 2. Try not to overload the client with too much to do, so the task does not seem overwhelming. 3. Make tasks behaviorally specific and measurable, a \"to-do\" rather than a \"not-to-do\" list. 4. Have clients record their successes and difficulties in achieving the tasks. Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Master Clinician Note: The counselor resists assuring Troy that meeting with the psychiatrist won't cause his kids to be taken away. It is important that the counselor never promise outcomes that are out of his control. The counselor can support the client (as shown here) to take constructive action to obtain a positive outcome. COUNSELOR: I know you're reluctant to see Dr. Moore, but I'm concerned about how stressed you are. This may affect keeping your home and your kids. Meeting with Dr. Moore could help with that. TROY: Yeah. Okay. When do I need to go? COUNSELOR: I'd like to get you in as soon as possible. I'll call and see if there's anything on Monday morning or, if not, as soon as possible. Okay? TROY. All right. When will I know? COUNSELOR: I'll call now. Give me a couple more minutes. [The counselor calls and arranges the psychiatric consult ation for the following Tuesday morning at 10 a.m. After passing along the information to Troy, he engages Troy in problem- solving about staying abstinent, not having friends over late at night, not being around people who are using, being especially careful during times when he is feeling stressed or hopeless, and particularly, g o\u00ad ing to AA again. Troy engages in the problem -solving efforts with the counselor, and the counse\u00ad lor helps Troy identify strengths to address each of these issues. He is reluctant to return to AA ; he says he quit going because his sponsor was putting too much pressure on him to complete his work on the program steps and because his best friend in the program had \"gone out,\" which Troy found really discouraging. He did agree to a noon meeting later in the week, while his boys were in school. Troy also agreed to ask his mom, who lives in the neighborhood, to babysit while he attends a meeting on Saturday night. The counselor and Troy talked about how he would r e\u00ad spond if he ran into his program sponsor, and they developed several options for this scenario. Th e counselor continues to be sensitive to Troy's potential for becoming overwhelmed with too many issues and defers other issues (parenting, employment) until future sessions. In closing, he reinforces Troy 's assignments of not being around people who are using, not staying up late at night (even if he is not sleepy), staying abstinent , and attending AA. Together, they make a list of thin gs Troy is to do and behaviors that will make it easier to accomplish them.] \u00ad 108 Part 1, Chapter 2 Visit 4 (counselor's office) The counselor's goals for this session are to: Follow up on Troy's psychiatric consultation. Follow up on how abstinence is progressing. Check on how Troy is doing with his sons. Ask Troy about his plans to resume employment . Troy arrives on time and looks somewhat less distressed and tired than he has on previous visits.He reports that his visit with the psychiatrist went well and that he liked Dr. Mo ore. The doctor had already reported to the counselor that he thought Troy's difficulties in focusing on tasks, notsleeping, feeling overwhelmed, and not thinking clearly were more a function of stress and alc o\u00ad hol and drug use than depression. He did not recommend medication but suggested that he would be glad to reevaluate Troy if he continued to have difficulties in thinking, feeling ove r\u00ad whelmed, or completing tasks. For more information on depression and substance abuse trea t\u00ad ment, see TIP 48, Managing D epressive Symptoms in Substance Abuse Clients During Early Recovery (CSAT, 2008). The session continues as Troy talks about a meeting with the teacher of his 8 -year-old son, Jimmy. TROY: I had another meeting with Jimmy's teacher. COUNSELOR: How did that go? TROY: Well, he's having some anger problems in school, and he's been getting there late. Actua l\u00ad ly, both of them are getting there late. COUNSELOR: Tell me about that. TROY: Well, they take a long time to get out of the house. They aren't exactly cooper ative all the time, you know? It's hard to pull 'em out of bed in the morning; I oversleep a little bit myself. COUNSELOR: Okay. TROY: I talked to Dr. Moore a little bit about it , and he said that maybe you guys could help. COUNSELOR: There are some things we can do to help. For example, you said sometimes you guys oversleep. We can work out a better way to manage that. TROY: Okay. COUNSELOR: What time are they supposed to be in school? TROY: They gotta get there at 8:30. COUNSELO R: Okay, 8:30. W hat time were you getting them up when they were getting there late? TROY: I don't know. I'd try to get them up around 7, but they'd get up at 8 or so. C OUNSELOR: It does take them a while to get ready for school, and they have to be there at 8: 30. H ow far is school from your home? 109 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless TROY: About 15 minutes. COUNSELOR: 15 minutes. So, you're going to need to have at least 15 minutes to get them to school. What else do you do in the morning before leaving for school? TROY: Well, they eat breakfast, usually cereal. I try to get them up around 6:30 or 7. Master Clinician Note: The counselor's technique is called cognitive structuring. He uses questions to model and encourage problem -solving about how Troy can more satisfactorily manage his time. The counselor also distinguishes Troy's intention (waking at 7 :00 a.m.) from the reality (waking at 8:00 a.m.). COUNSELOR: So let's say you get them up at 7:00. You need 15 minutes to get to school, so that leaves an hour and 15 minutes to dress and feed them. Can you do that? TROY: I can do it. COUNSELOR: So, can we make a plan for that? Today is Wednesday, so for 2 more days of school \u2014 [The counselor writes up a schedule for Troy to follow in the morning. Troy reads it and agrees that he will try it out. Troy then changes the subject to his kids.] TROY: I get a real hassle from the boys. They fight me, and they fight each other. COUNSELOR: What do you think they need? TROY: Oh, I don't know. I guess I fought with my brothers every day when I was a kid , too. [The counselor continues to explore the issue of the children's behavior with Troy, and they d e\u00ad cide that if things don't get better in a month or if things get worse in the interim, they'll look into counseling options for the boys. The counselor is reluctant to jump right into seeking coun\u00adseling for the boys, expecting that things might get better if Troy stays abstinent and the home situation stabilizes.] COUNSELOR: Troy, I would like to raise the possibility with you of having the boys participate in some after -school acti vities at the Boy's Club right down the street from our center. They have a bunch of good programs, including sports, helping them with homework, and giving them some time to socialize and play with other kids. Plus, it would give you some extra time away from having to watch the boys to get some stuff done. So, I'm wondering if you would be willingto drop by there and see what is available that might be right for your boys and consider it. TROY: Well, I could do that. I know where it is; I used to walk by it every day. I never knew what they did in there, other than play basketball. COUNSELOR: Well, actually, they do a lot of things , and some might be helpful to you and to your boys. TROY: Okay, I'll look into it. 110 Brief Strategic Family Therapy If the children continue to show behavioral problems in school, the counselor might consider adap t\u00ad ing an evidence- based practice, brief strategic family therapy (BSFT). Although Troy's sons are a bit younger than the typical age when BSFT is applied, it might pro ve helpful. BSFT is designed to (1) prevent, reduce, and/or treat adolescent behavior problems , such as drug use, conduct problems, delinquency, sexually risky behavior, aggressive/violent behavior, and assoc i\u00ad ation with antisocial peers; (2) improve prosoc ial , such as school attendance and perfo r\u00ad mance; and (3) improve family functioning, including effective parental leadership and management, positive parenting, and parental involvement with the child and his or her peers and school. BSFT is typic ally delivered in 12 to 16 family sessions but may be delivered in as few as 8 or as many as 24 sessions, depending on the severity of the communication and management problems within the family. Sessions are conducted at locations that are convenient to the family, including the family's home in some cases. Hispanic families have been the principal recipients of BSFT, but African Amer i\u00ad can families have also participated in the intervention. BSFT considers adolescent symptomatology to be rooted in maladapti ve family interactions, inap\u00ad propriate family alliances, overly rigid or permeable family boundaries, and parents' tendency to b e\u00ad lieve that a single individual (usually the adolescent) is responsible for the family's troubles. BSFT operates according to the assumption that transforming how the family functions will help improve the teen's presenting problem. BSFT's therapeutic techniques fall into three categories: joining, d i\u00ad agnosing, and restructuring. The therapist initially \"joins\" the family by encouraging family members to behave in their normal fashion. The therapist then diagnoses repetitive patterns of family intera c\u00ad tion. Restructuring refers to the change- producing strategies that the therapist uses to promote new, more adaptive patterns of interact ion. For more information, see the BSFT Web site (http:// www.bsft.org). Part 1, Chapter 2 COUNSELOR: Troy, I just want to be sure your rent situation is taken care of for now. Where do we stand with that? TROY: Well, I think it's okay. I have emergency assistance tha t has paid what I owed for the p ast 2 months, and I'm current now. Section 8 housing has reduced my rent because I'm unemployed , but, you know, this #*%! public assistance doesn't really pay for crap. I got these two kids I g otta keep going. I'm not a rich man! I'm just not making ends meet. COUNSELOR: Do you think you' re ready to look for a job? Y ou think you can handle that right now? TROY: I don't know if I want to go back to work right away , because then I got a problem o n the other end ; we sometimes work until 6 at night. What are the kids gonna do for 3 hours? COUNSELOR: Okay, let's work on child care if you need that. We need to make a plan that'll help you in the long run , so when you work and can't get home on time, the boys will still be cared for. TROY: Does that mean they're gonna take the kids away from me? COUNSELOR: No. This is all about helping you. We have a temporary childcare program here that will help you for up to about 2 months. That's the longest they will help you. It allows us to develop a plan for you. One option is for your mom to keep the boys in the afternoon. We didtalk about your mom; you were concerned about the money you owed her. 111 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless TROY: [ worried ] Yeah. We're not talking much. COUNSELOR: Tell me about when you were being raised up . Did you ever do anything that may have upset your mother? Like miss school, and she caught you , and she was upset about it? TROY: Yeah. Well, we had our days. COUNSELOR: And after those days happened, was your mom still talking to you? TROY: Yeah. Yeah. I mean she's \u2014yeah, she's all right. COUNSELOR: So she continued to talk to you? TROY: [ sounds anxious] Yeah, but like, you know, I'm trying to do the best that I can. I gotta show her that I'm doing my thing , but I owe her all this money. COUNSELOR: Do you think she would be proud of your being able to take care of a lot of the things you have taken care of, like your housing? TROY: Yeah. Yeah. I see where you're going with this. I still feel kinda uncomfortable. Y ou know , I don't feel so good about this, but maybe, maybe ... COUNSELOR: Okay. Let me ask you this. Let's practice for a few minutes what you might say to your mom and how she might respond. Then, what if you called your mom from here at the office to see if you can make some headway in how y'all get along. Do you remember how we did role-play when you were here in treatment? TROY: Sure, I'd go with that. COUNSELOR: Okay, let's start with you being your mom, and I'll be you. And talk to me, as if I'm Troy, about how you feel about me and how things have been going. I want you to really li s\u00ad ten to your mom, see what she says. You may be surprised; she may be supportive, strong, and notworried much about the money. And I want you to hear what her concerns are about how you are doing and what she expects of you. Master Clinician Note: Role-play is an excellent counseling resource for helping clients prepare for difficult interpersonal situations. A description of how to set up a role-play and how it can be us ed is presented in the next vignette (Ren\u00e9). [Troy a nd the counselor proceed to role -play an interaction between Troy and his mom. After\u00ad ward, Troy believes that he understands more of where she is coming from and can more co m\u00ad fortably talk with her about the money he owes her and about her helping with child care. ] COUNSELOR : Let me change the subject for a minute and ask you how you are doing with not drinking or smoking weed . TROY: Well, I had one beer the other evening, standing around outside with some other guys, and then I got to feeling bad about it. I had 9 days put together. But I know from here and AA that a beer is a beer. But that is all I've had , and no dope now for almost 2 weeks. COUNSELOR: What about AA? 112 Part 1, Chapter 2 TROY: I've been twice, both to noon meetings because I didn't have anyone to watch the kids. I didn't see my old sponsor either time . I guess when I run into him, we'll have to get straight with each other. [The counselor and Troy continue to talk for a few minutes about the need to remain cle an and sober. They discuss the people, places, and things that might provoke a return to use. T he cou n\u00ad selor is supportive of Troy in finding alternatives to drinking or smoking marijuana. ] COUNSELOR: Okay. I appreciate all the hard work you've put into this. I think you've done a lot. I think you've made some positive changes. Do you agree with that? TROY: So far, so good. COUNSELOR: Okay, so what if we continue to meet once a week? If and when you get your roofing job back or another job, we'll look at how we can arrange counseling around your sched\u00adule. I remember that Carl often lets people take off an hour or two around lunch if they are goingto a counseling session. And I think we have goals and priorities pretty set now: staying clean , keeping your housing, helping the boys get settled, handling stress and life problems, managingyour finances, and getting back in good graces with your mom. Does that pretty well handle it? TROY: Well, I'm better off than I was a month ago, that's for sure. Summary Troy experienced a number of significant stressors that were aggravated by marijuana and alcohol abuse and his difficulties in coping with stress. On presentation, Troy was in the action stage of change for keeping his housing and his kids and the contemplation stage of change for drinkingand marijuana use. The counselor used a variety of techniques and multidisciplinary tools (forinstance, consultation with the staff psychiatrist, referral to AA, supportive problem- solving, co g\u00ad nitive structuring, and role- play) to help Troy move ahead in the stages of change for addressing his marijuana and alcohol use and other life difficulties. Future sessions will focus on child care,improving parenting skills, preventing relapse, and maintaining his job. Long -term goals include helping Troy: Maintain stable housing through the Section 8 voucher program. Reduce his negative thinking and increase his hope and planning for the future. Maintain contact with his family for help with child care and recovery activities. Identify funds that he can use to pay his mother for helping with the kids. Identify after -school programs so his children can stay at school while he's working. Support stable continuation of recovery using agency resources and self -help programs . Continue to develop effective coping and parenting skills, problem -solving abilit ies, and stress management techniques . Vignette 5 \u2014 Ren\u00e9 Overview Ren\u00e9 is in the transition planning/ongoing homelessness rehabilitation phase. This vignettedemonstrates approaches and techniques for substance abuse relapse prevention. 113 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Ren\u00e9 is a 44 -year-old man in intensive outpatient (IOP) treatment for heroin dependence. He relapsed once during treatment but recovered and got back on track quickly. His treatment pr o\u00ad gram ends in 3 weeks, and he needs a new place to live\u2014his current apartment is attached to the program. The stress of the impending transition contributed to his relapse. Ren\u00e9 used heroin a f\u00ad ter his last paychec k, but he did keep his job. He has a history of intermittent homelessness. His job doesn't pay well but offers benefits. He's a good fit for a so ber living facility, which offers quality housing and social and abstinence supports. Setting Working in a substance abuse treatment organization's intensive outpatient program, the couns e\u00ad lor offers case management and counseling services for transition into ongoing homelessness r e\u00ad habilitation services and independent housing. Learning Objectives Use counseling methods that support positive behaviors as objectively defined goals co n\u00ad sistent with recovery and stable housing. Help client identify a nd change behaviors that are not con ducive to meeting objectively d e\u00ad fined recovery goals. Teach the client relapse prevention and life skills. Strategies and Techniques Conceptualizing behavioral change activities oriented toward substance abuse recovery as therapeutic goal management Coping skills training conceptualized as short -term goals agreed to with clients to accomplish longer -term sustained behavior change Counselor Skills and Attitudes Recognize and address underlying problem behaviors that may impede the client's recovery and housing stability. Facilitate the client's identification, selection, and practice of strategies, especially goal a t\u00ad tainment, to sustain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed for maintaining recovery andhousing. Recognize the importance of continued support, encouragement, and use of reinforcementand contingency management. Vigne tte Visit 1 (counselor's office) The counselor has worked with Ren\u00e9 throughout his time in the IOP program. He's abstinent but nervous about the future. The counselor begins the first session with these goals in mind: Conceptualize Ren\u00e9's recent relapse. Encourage him to increase his attendance at Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings. Discuss his housing options. 114 Part 1, Chapter 2 The counselor greets Ren\u00e9 and asks how he's been. Ren\u00e9 is in a tough spot, having relapsed while preparing to transition out of the program. If he didn't trust the counselor, he might respond with \"I'm okay, I can deal with it,\" but they have good rapport. Ren\u00e9 believes she'll help him, so he o f\u00ad fers an opening for help. REN \u00c9: Man, life has been crazy. Working on that bull#*%! job, it ain't payin' nothing. I really don't have no clue what I wanna do in about 3 more weeks. My girl, she's trippin'. CO UNSELOR: It's a lot. I mentioned a halfway house and a sober living facility as steps toward building some quality sober time . What do you think? R EN\u00c9: I don't know about that #*%!. I want my own spot, you know? C OUNSELOR: I understand that you 'd like your own apartment , and I hope we can work t o\u00ad ward that. R EN\u00c9: #*%!, it don't make no difference! I don't make enough money. I don't know what I'm gonna do. C OUNSELOR: Well, would you be able to accept the goal of moving to a halfway house, and then, when you have another 60 days under your belt, we can talk about moving into a sober li v\u00ad ing house ? We could talk about how you'd deal with that time in the halfwa y house. Master Clinician Note: The counselor should be aware of local housing options, including single room occupancy housing, shelters, halfway and transitional living houses, sober houses, Housing First , and other community housing opportunities. Each meets a specific housing need , and all have unique requirements for participation. Some have no financial requirements; some, such as sober housing, involve a fixed monthly rent based on ability to pay ; and some require an agreement to pay a percentage of earned income. Some have no requirements about drug use or maintaining sobriety, but others require abstinence from alcohol and any illegal or illicit drugs. Some are for relatively short periods of time and others are ongoing. Each meets a unique need in the community. REN\u00c9: I don't want that #!*%!. I had lots of time in that kind of by -the-rulebook living. I guess it's my fault, but I ain't making no money on that job. C OUNSELOR: You're thinking it's your fault? This situation? REN \u00c9:Ye a h, ' cause I been shooting dope for a long time. This #*%! may not even work for me. I probably waited too long, you know? COUN SELOR: Well, Ren\u00e9, I really hope you will work toward getting your own place. R EN\u00c9: Aw man, that #*%! is crazy. I'm tired of living with other people. Yo u know how them places are? COUN SELOR: You've done really well here. Except for that relapse, you've managed to use the pro gram to your advantage. Can you allow yourself to feel good about that? 115 How To Help a Client Identify Triggers for Relapse Working on relapse prevention is a good way to help many clients maintain housing. Identifying tri g\u00ad gers is one way to start, and this can be done in several ways. Be respectful and kind; this convers a\u00ad tion tends to evoke shame in clients: 1. Open with, \"Tell me about what happened the last time you relapsed.\" The point is not to get a list o f the triggers your client already knows about, but rather to really understand what ha p\u00ad pened this time. 2. Ask the client to look back in time to identify each choice point that led to the relapse. 3. Keep going back until you reach t he point where the client veered from the recovery pathway into relapse. The choice point may be earlier than the client thought, or it may be a feeling he or she is reluctant to talk about. I f it's a feeling, identify the thought that led to the feel ing. 4. Help the client brainstorm and practice ways to handle the situation or feeling the next time. Role-play helps clients practice coping skills and develop a sense of mastery. It also increases self-esteem and provides further motivation to continue the recovery process. For more information on identifying and addressing triggers, see the planned TIP, Recovery in Behavioral Health Services (SAMHSA, planned e). Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless REN\u00c9: Y eah! I'd never been clean very long before, so I'm real happy about that. But I think maybe this is the best it's gonna get for me. C OUNSELOR: If this is the best it's gonna get for now, let's talk about how you'll handle it. R EN\u00c9: #*%!. I don't know how. C OUNSELOR: Well let's talk about that relapse you had. What happened? I'm sure you've r e\u00ad viewed this in your treatment groups. We talked about this before, but let's just go over it again. R EN\u00c9: It was kind of a blur. I got off work and those dudes wanted to go out. They act stupid every time they drink, so I didn't wanna go with them. I was walking back to my place thinking about all this stuff that's going on, and I seen Cheryl and we started kickin' it. Next thing I know, I'm shooting dope. C OUNSELOR: So you got paid, you saw your girlfriend, and sort of went off. R EN\u00c9: Yeah. Now that I think about it, I can't remember many times that I've had sex without using . Maybe I don't think I can perform without dope. I don't know how, but that #*%! comes together for some reason. Master Clinician Note: Ren\u00e9 has had this trigger for a long time. It's important to address it because it's a powerful trigger for relapse. The counselor can reflect what he's struggling with, ask about how he can be helpful, and go back farther to identify relapse triggers that happened earlier than this one. COUNSELOR: So the main feeling that you're working toward is that feeling you have when you're high and having sex? So it's hard to imagine life without that? RE N\u00c9: Y eah. I guess so.That could be it. COUNSELOR: Have you had sex with your girlfriend without being high? 116 How To Help Clients Appreciate the Progress They Have Made You can help client s like Ren\u00e9, who are mired in feeling one step away from homelessness, see how far they have come (general strategies applicable to all clients are followed by specific examples tak\u00ad en from Ren\u00e9 's case): Elicit information about the changes they've made in their lives (e.g., by asking Ren\u00e9, \"What makes this temporary move different from all the other moves you've made in the past 20 years?\" ). Shift focus (e.g., by saying to Ren\u00e9, \"Let's think of some things you could do that wouldn't lead to meeting Cheryl and getting high.\" ) Reinforce recognition of triggers and insight s (e.g., that Ren\u00e9 is scared ab out becoming homeless and having so much going on ); unlocking triggers will help clients along the road to recovery. The goal is to boost clients' self-confidence, which will cont inue to rise as they put together additio n\u00ad al successes. Part 1, Chapter 2 REN\u00c9: Y eah, a couple times. CO UNSELOR: And how was it? REN\u00c9: We really couldn't do the #*%! that I'm accustomed to doing, you know? COUNSELOR: Um -hum. Was she high? REN \u00c9: Ye a h. COUNSEL OR: She was high and you weren 't. REN\u00c9: I wasn't. You can't really enjoy yourself or have the fun you wanna have, so you need som ething else to help you really enjoy it. Then you add on top of that the #*%! I'm going through. It could be one of a thousand things. It could be that I'm about to be homeless. Maybe that's it, and I don't wanna do that #*%! no more. I know when I'm loaded I can hustle and get some money and take care of my business. CO UNSELOR: So it's pretty hard to find a substitute for that, and yet you have just said the fea r of being homeless again almost is enough for you to imagine you can give it up. REN\u00c9: Y eah, the thought of that alone makes my stomach hurt. Have me where I can't breathe. You're asking me to see 6 months down the road.That's too long. Everything I do, I need imme\u00addiate results, immediate . I go steal something, immediately I sell it. So waiting 2 weeks for my check, I'm struggling with that, because for years, I didn't have to delay nothing. And relatio n\u00ad ships \u2014the first thing that I'm gonna do is get in a relationship, but in treatment and self -help groups , they tell you not to. C OUNSELOR: So, Ren\u00e9, is it fair to say the first thing you want to do is enjoy yourself? RE N\u00c9: Y es. COUNSELOR: The first thing you want to do is have fun, and right now, it's the old ways of hav ing fun that you're thinking ab out. You're not aware of the new ways. REN\u00c9: I don't know any new ways of how to really enjoy myself. 117 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless COUNSELOR: I understand it has been a long time since you enjoyed much of anything wit h\u00ad out being high. I'm wondering if there is anything you have enjoyed here in the treatment pr o\u00ad gram \u2014the groups, visiting with other people, helping someone out, something like that. R EN\u00c9: Man, that ain't FUN. That's just hanging out. C OUNSELOR: So it seems like things have to be high energy, high excitement to really be fun. R EN\u00c9: Maybe so. Otherwise it just seems boring. Like living in a damned halfway house or something. C OUNSELOR: C ould we look for a minute at what would be fun that isn't bad for you in the long run ? R EN\u00c9: Man, I don't know. C OUNSELOR: We ll, it seems like we've raised several issues to work on here over the long haul. The first is how to have fun without it having to be high energy or high risk. The second is how to have some high -energy fun sometimes without getting into stuff that is destructive for you, like getting involved with drugs or maybe with Cheryl. The third may be to recognize when you are having fu n and enjoying something that's just an everyday thing . R EN\u00c9: Man, that's high -level #*%!. I'm not sure I'm ready for that stuff. [ The counselor is satisfied to have raised the issue of how Ren\u00e9 conceptualizes having fun for right now. Ren\u00e9 has given a clear message that he is ready to change the topic. The counselor r e\u00ad spects Ren\u00e9 's wishes and moves on to another topic raised by Ren\u00e9 earlier. ] COUNSELOR: Well, you said that the worst possible thing is to become homeless again. R EN\u00c9: Y eah, I know once I become homeless, I'd probably be going crazy. I lose my place, I go back on the street, I shoot dope and end up back in prison. And the nights are very scary. C OUNSELOR: You have been in this program for several months, and you haven't relapsed. Master Clinician Note: This is an example of strengths -based counseling: the counselor affirms Ren\u00e9's strengths, eliciting that one of his stre ngths is the ability to derive support from his counselor and people in recovery. This, in turn, supports Ren\u00e9's adaptive coping mechanisms. REN\u00c9: Well, I don't wanna go back to prison. And then I was able to talk to you and the people in treatment. I have them for support, so ... COUNSELOR: So that is one way you helped yourself out of homelessness. [ Ren\u00e9 is looking away. ] I feel like I'm losing you because you're looking away. Can you look me in the eye? R EN\u00c9: Y eah, that's kinda hard. CO UNSELOR: Why is that kind of hard? REN\u00c9: Uh... 118 Part 1, Chapter 2 COUNSELOR: Is it hard because I'm female and we're talking about intimate things? R EN\u00c9: [tearful ] Well, I don't feel good about it, you know. I'm supposed to be way past this, but it seems like I'm just spinnin' my wheels. I'm not getting anywhere. Master Clinician Note: The shame that Ren\u00e9 is feeling can be challenging to a counselor. In this case, the counselor stays with it long enough to let Ren\u00e9 feel it. Then she reframes it as progress and helps him look forward to what he want s to do. As with all interventions, it is important that this intervention be handled in a culturally appropriate manner. COUNSELOR: I'm hearing that you've come a long way and that you've had an idea now about what are probably some of your most difficult triggers, but you've got your finger on it. R EN\u00c9: Well, what's that? COUNSELOR: We're talking about Cheryl and payday and when she calls. And also about fea r\u00ad ing homelessness and getting fearful and then wanting to go out and use. I think you understand that it's what you have to do to get to where you want to be. You think to yourself, \" I didn't like relapsing. I don't want to be homeless again.\" And yet here's this temptation in the form of your girlfriend. So what else can you do on payday when she's ca lling? RE N\u00c9: I need to quit that. That's for #*%! sure. If I wanna get myself in my own apartment , I'm gonna have to struggle with that, to not hang out with her. C OUNSELOR: So, how are you going to tell her? Or are you going to tell her that? [They discuss whether and how Ren\u00e9 will be able to make a break with Cheryl.] C OUNSELOR: Well, how about trying that. Just not call her and not see her. Do you think that'll work? Can you give it a try and we'll see how it goes? R EN\u00c9: Y eah, maybe. I'll give it a try . C OUNSELOR: Now, what about these friends? The guys out on the street that hang out and want you to join them. We've talked a lot about that all through the program. It's real hard to hang out on the corner with all those guys who are high and not use. REN\u00c9: Really, my friends are all in prison, so, it's hard for me to make friends. I probably need to try and meet some other friends. I really don't like the guys at NA. They're like, \" You can't do this, you can't do that.\" I wanna be able to do everything anybody else does. CO UNSELOR: Well, if you're going to stay clean , you're going to need a good support system. You're talking about doing something that's difficult. It's payday, and you're trying not to have any contact with your girlfriend. There are pe ople hanging around saying they want to be your friend because you've got a paycheck. R EN \u00c9: Ye a h. C OUNSELOR: So, what other people are there \u2014people to hang with and have a good time with who won't point you in the wrong direction? 119 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless REN\u00c9: Y ou know, I really don't have any fun with nobody but people that are active users. CO UNSELOR: Are you going to meetings? REN\u00c9: Y eah, I go to meetings. COUNSELOR: How often do you go? REN\u00c9: About 3 times a week. COUNSELOR: What would you think of increasing that? REN\u00c9: Hone stly? Yeah, I know I need to go more. My sponsor tells me I need to go more. COUNSELOR: How often does your sponsor say you need to go? REN\u00c9: If you asked him, he'd say 7 days a week. COUNSELOR: That sounds like it might be a good idea. REN\u00c9: That's way too much. It's bad enough sittin' in those meetings. But, that could be an o p\u00ad tio n. It's only an hour. So, how about this halfway house you were talking about? COUNSELOR: Well, it's warm, it's got beds, meals, a bunch of guys who aren't using on site. It's not treatment, everybody takes part in taking care of the house, and if you're interested, they can help with things like getting a better job. It's not treatment, but it 's a safe place for another 30 or 60 days; after that, we can maybe get you into a sober living house. REN\u00c9: How long would I have to stay there in sober living before I get my own place? COUNSELOR: Well, it is going to be a while, probably at least a year or two, before you have a ste ady income and are back on your feet. You want to go by an d check it out? REN\u00c9: I guess we can go by and take a look at it. COUNSELOR: I think the other thing we'll do is to plan to meet pretty often between now and yo ur discharge time a couple weeks from now. REN\u00c9: Y eah, that would be good, because I have more o f a relationship with you than I have with anybody else. I feel comfortable talking to you about these kinds of things. CO UNSELOR: When is payday? REN\u00c9: Uh, next week. COUNSELOR: So, let's start with that day. What do you want to happen? REN\u00c9: I really do n't know. COUNSELOR: What did you say before? Let's talk about how it can be different from other pay days. [Ren\u00e9 and the counselor create a plan for payday, which includes avoiding Cheryl, buying som e\u00ad thing with his money so he won't be tempted to use it to buy drugs, and going to the movies an d 120 Part 1, Chapter 2 getting something to eat as a fun, substance -free recreational activity. Ren\u00e9 agrees to consider staying at a halfway house after he leaves the IOP housing, to attend sessions three times a week, and to continue to give urine screens.] Visit 2 (counselor's office) Ren\u00e9 had an insight about why he has been stuck and risking relapse, and he seems ready to try out some ways to avoid further relapses. The counselor has the following goals: Review how Ren\u00e9 handled the weekend . Assess his current ability to effectively manage high -risk situations like running into his ex - girlfriend. Practice refusal skills and other appropriate skills as needed . The counselor asks Ren\u00e9 about payday; he says he didn't see Cheryl. He bough t a cell phone , got some food to eat, and saw a movie. The counselor reinforces this a chieve ment and asks Ren\u00e9 to tell her about it. RE N\u00c9: Well, it was a lot of work , because I was thinking about it the entire night before. I was thinking about what I was gonna do when I get my check and how I was gonna do it, so it wasn't easy. How not to go see Cheryl, what if I do see her? The more I tried not to think about seein' her, the more I thought about seein' her. So, it was good we talked about it in advance, because it was a struggle not goin' into the store to cash my paycheck. But, I went to the cell phone storeinstead. I kept telling myself, \"Hey, look, I'm goin' to get me a cell phone, you know, and that's what I'm gonna do.\" CO UNSELOR: Did you have the thoughts of being homeless, being back in jail? R EN\u00c9: No, because if I have thoughts about that, I'd have to see Cheryl. Master Clinician Note: The counselor notes the connection between Cheryl as a relapse trigger leading to Ren\u00e9's being homeless. She dec ides not to present this to R en\u00e9 right now because it would lead their discussion in a different direction. The counselor wants to stay focused on managing high -risk situations, building refusal skills, and building other strengths. COUNSELOR: Okay, so, th e fact that you got through that day is very commendable. And now it's about having more clean time, building that into the future. RE N\u00c9: Y eah, it kinda put it into perspective \u2014one day at a time. COUNSELOR: I think we do need to deal with the fact that yo ur ex is going to try to find you. RE N\u00c9: Y eah, I'm sure she is. Matter of fact, I know she is. COUNSELOR: So, in a couple more days, you're getting another paycheck, and this time she's going to say, \"I'm not letting that guy avoid me this week!\" So I thought maybe we should play it out a little bit. So, can you put yourself in her shoes and pretend you're her? 121 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Master Clinician Note: In this situation , role-play can help Ren\u00e9 experience the immediacy of feelings he will face when he sees his ex and rehearse a plan to manage these feelings while interacting with her. The counselor and Ren\u00e9 will role-play twice. The first time, the counselor will play Ren\u00e9 and model behavior. The second time, Ren\u00e9 will be himself in the role -play. Ren\u00e9 is already familiar with role - plays because they use them in the treatment program. When introducing role - playing for the first time, you should expect that the client may f eel silly or uncomfortable. Reinforce communication of this discomfort and provide an explanation for the purpose of the role -play. For more information abo ut conducting a role -play, refer to the planned TIP , Recovery in Behavioral Health Services (SAMHSA, planned e). REN\u00c9: Y eah, because she's been bullyin' me for a while. COUNSELOR: Okay, so we're going to take ourselves to the store. Okay, the usual thing that happens is you have the check, you go to the store. RE N\u00c9: Cash my check. Get me an iced tea and a couple of scratchers. COUNSELOR: Okay, and there she comes. She pops in. So, I'm going to be you and you're g o\u00ad in g to be Cheryl. Okay? REN\u00c9: Okay. COUNSELOR: So here I am as you, I've got my check and I buy my tea and scratchers, and I'm hea ding out to figure how to use that cell phone better and think about a movie, and there you come. Go ahead. REN\u00c9/ CHERYL: Hey, Ren\u00e9, what 'cha doin'? COUNSELOR/ REN\u00c9: Hey, Cheryl, just, uh, mindin' my own business. Just gonna go hang out. REN\u00c9/ CHERYL: Win any money on t hat scratcher? COUNSELOR/ REN\u00c9: No, not this time. RE N\u00c9/CHERYL: Well, you gotta be in it to win it. You win a million dollars, what 'cha gonna do? COUNSELOR/ REN\u00c9: Get as far away from here as I can. RE N\u00c9/CHERYL: Gonna take me with you? COUNSELOR/ REN\u00c9: Cheryl, I gotta live my life without you. I can't have you in my life. I kno w that you didn't see me last weekend and you probably thought, \"Well, he forgot about me this week,\" but you can't go with me any longer. REN\u00c9/ CHERYL: Quit playin g, Ren\u00e9. #*%!, you know you COUNSELOR/ REN\u00c9: I can't do it, Cheryl. REN\u00c9/ CHERYL: You know you like me! 122 Part 1, Chapter 2 COUNSELOR/ REN\u00c9: Can't do it, Cheryl. REN\u00c9/ CHERYL: Ain't nobody gonna treat you the way I treat you. COUNSELOR/ REN\u00c9: I like the way you treat me, Cheryl, but I can't go back down that road. Se eing you , I see drugs, I see love, I see sex, I see disappearing into some bedroom with you. I'm ne ver getting back from there, or goin' in there with you again. REN\u00c9/ CHERYL: Well, what do you want me to do? Maybe I don't want to live my life without you. Did you think of that? COUNSELOR/ REN\u00c9: I gotta take care of myself. I don't know whether I can tell you what you can do for yourself, but I know for myself that you gotta get out of my life, and I gotta get you out of my life. R EN\u00c9/ CHERYL: [ forlorn ] Look, I feel lonely, baby. COUNSELOR/ REN\u00c9: I'm goin g. I'm gonna go back to that telephone store, I'm gonna learn how to work this thing, I'm gonna pick out a \u2014 RE N\u00c9/CHERYL: Oh! so you think you're too good for me now! You go to a treatment program, you g et on this high -ass horse; you get a few dollars for bus fare, and now you too good for me! COUNSELOR/ REN\u00c9: No, I don't think I'm too good for you. I just can't be this close to you anymore . RE N\u00c9/CHERYL: You talk that # *%! about you care about me, and all that! COUNSELOR/ REN\u00c9: I'm done. I'm gone. Master Clinician Note: The counselor models imperfect res ponses and struggles a bit so the client doesn't end up thinking \"I c ould never do that!\" [The first role -play ends, and the counselor and Ren\u00e9 return to being themselves.] COUNSELOR: Okay, Ren\u00e9, how did you think that went , that little exercise that we just did ? REN\u00c9: I see she really don't care about me. She's just an addict. When she said \" you think you're be tter than m e,\" I believe that I'm better than the dope game. I work hard not to be a dope fiend, so, yeah, I'm better than her. COUNSELOR: Okay, well, you gave me a hard time during that. It was tough to walk away. RE N\u00c9: Cheryl would probably create a scene in that store, and I probably would have had to leave \u2014that 's the only way you can deal with it. COUNSELOR: Okay, how about we reverse it now, and I'll be Cheryl, and you be yourself. REN \u00c9: All right. COUNSELOR: So, you're coming out of the store, and here I come. COUNSELOR/CHERYL: Well, hey there, Ren\u00e9, where ya been? 123 How To Follow Up Role -Play In an individual session 1. Keep having the c lient do brief (2 minutes or less) role-plays to build confidence that he or she can do it. 2. If the client shows inability to follow through (e.g., the client gives in), one appropriate response would be, \"Well, that didn't go so well, what do you need to do the next time to walk away?\" In a group session When using role- play in a group, the clients are often much tougher than the counselor. When the client is successful in coping under these conditions, he or she has gone through both an emotional and a behavior al experience. Following the role- play: 1. Ask the person playing the client what he or she did well first; then ask, \"How could you do it better?\" 2. Ask the clients in the group what they thought went well and what could have been done better without repeatin g what someone else has observed. 3. Summarize the most important feedback: \"Here's what the group said you could've done; let's do it again.\" 4. Repeat brief role- plays (about 2 minutes) until the client has a sense of mastery, and he or she is demonstrating an ability to handle the situation well. Very short, repetitive role -plays work best. Each time clients role- play, they learn something more. When they feel they've learned all they can, their sense of mastery has improved and they feel they are prepared to handle the situation. If clients experience craving at the end of the role- play, use this as an opportunity to teach them to manage craving s. Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless REN\u00c9: Hey, what's up, Cheryl, how ya doin'? I don't have time, girl, I'm on my way. I gotta go. CO UNSELOR/CHERYL: Hey, you know, you dissed me last week. I didn't like that very much. REN\u00c9: I ain't never dissed you. COUNSELOR/CHERYL: Did you miss me? REN\u00c9: No. COUNSELOR/CHERYL: Aw, come on now! REN\u00c9: Cheryl, you don't give a #*%! about me; all you interested in is dope and I \u2014 COUNSELOR/CHERYL: [ cooing ] You know I love you, you know I love you. REN\u00c9: Would you love me if I was broke? COUNSELOR/CHERYL: Sure, I'd love you if you were broke. But, you know what? I got paid today. I got us a room! Come on, come on, Ren\u00e9. Let's go. REN\u00c9: No, no. I'm not cool with that. COUNSELOR/CHERYL: Come on, I got some f or us to share, baby. REN\u00c9: No, no. I'm not cool with that. COUNSELOR/CHERYL: I got some really good #*%! here, Ren\u00e9. 124 Part 1, Chapter 2 REN\u00c9: I can't do that. COUNSELOR/CHERYL: Come on, come o n! Let's go, Ren\u00e9. R EN\u00c9: No. I'm not cool with that. No. I've had it. I'm outta here! [ Ren\u00e9 gets up and walks away. ] COUNSELOR/CHERYL: Come on, come on, Ren\u00e9! You know we can feel good. [ Ren\u00e9 agrees to go to NA more often and has practiced coping skills in case he sees Cheryl. In the next session, it will be important to follow up on his use of these skills, explore how Ren\u00e9 manages his next encounter with Cheryl, and do more role -playing (if needed) to address any challenges that arise. He is ready to move into the boarding house and doesn't feel as vulnerable to relapse.] Visit 3 (counselor's office) Ren\u00e9 has decided he will stay in the halfway house until he is eli gible to enter a sober living housing unit . He completed the outpatient program last week and had to vacate his program - provided apartment. The counselor begins Visit 3 with the following goals in mind: Review his attendance and commitment to daily NA meetings. Review relapse prevention coping skills. Review skills he needs to practice for long -term recovery. The session begins with a review of how Ren\u00e9 is adjusting to the halfway house. C OUNSELOR: All right, well, the past couple times we met, we've been talking about how things have gone on payd ay, and we did the role -play about what yo u'd do if you ran into Cheryl. R EN\u00c9: Y eah, I really liked that. I saw her at a distance right before she saw me, so I got away. C OUNSELOR: There you go. R EN\u00c9: Yeah, I know, even though we went through that, you know, and I role -played, I really just want to keep myself from being in that position, so if I can see her first, I won't come in co n\u00ad tact with her. C OUNSELOR: So, that'd bring up all kinds of feelings again. R EN\u00c9: Yeah, not that I don't know if I could de al with them or not, that's not the real issue. I f I can keep from dealing with Cheryl in any form, I'm okay. But I know I'm eventually gonna run into her. C OUNSELOR: So, you've been going to your meetings? R EN\u00c9: Yeah. That sponsor of mine, he's crazy. He wants me to make a commitment, you know. I'm already working and #*%!, I can't do that. He wants me to be the coffee person at the meet\u00ading, you know, go buy the stuff, go do my 4th step, make the commitment. C OUNSELOR: So, what's your reluctance about making the commitment? R EN\u00c9: I don't have time. I don't wanna be the coffee person. 125 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless COUNSELOR: Okay. Well, at this time, you're going to need as many places as possible to be that are good places for you to be. R EN\u00c9: Y eah, that's what he said, too. Safety. Re sponsibility. C OUNSELOR: So, if it isn't being a coffee person, what else can you build in right now? What else are you doing besides the meetings and work and spending payday avoiding your girlfriend? How is halfway house living coming ? R EN\u00c9: Well, it's okay. Some of the people I knew in the program are there. I like playin' chess, so I might start playin' chess again. There is one guy in the house who says he will play with me. I really do have time to be the coffee person, you know. I guess that's my own thing, not wanting the responsibility. C OUNSELOR: Sounds like maybe you want to do it. Maybe you're just talking yourself out of it. R EN \u00c9: Ye a h. C OUNSELOR: It can be hard to make a commitment to another person. REN\u00c9: Yeah, this guy wants me to do it. Whe n I say, \" Why do I have to be the coffee person?\" he says, \"Just be the coffee person.\" He needs to tell me what I'm gonna get out of it. I don't wa n\u00ad na just do it because he wants me to. CO UNSELOR: Well, you're always on time for appointments. You can kee p an appointment. I'm wondering what it would do to how you think about yourself if you we re responsible and d e\u00ad pendable. R EN\u00c9: Well, I just don't think of myself that way.That ain't me. Master Clinician Note: The counselor is helping Ren\u00e9 clarify how reco very-oriented relationships that include commitment and responsibility can be adaptive, healthy, and rewarding in contrast to his maladaptive relationship with Cheryl, his lack of responsibility in the past, and his reluctance to commit to anything. REN\u00c9: I may be getting to the point where I don't need to go to meetings that often, you know? COUNSELOR: So maybe you're trying to get away from committing yourself to the meetings. REN\u00c9: Well, #*%!, I don't need to go 7 days a week. COUNSELOR: Remember now, Ren\u00e9, we're work ing on finishing your 60 days in the halfway ho use, then looking forward to moving into sober living . It's going to be here sooner than you know. REN\u00c9: Yeah, yeah. CO UNSELOR: You're independent even in this, you know. And being in sober housing will be another step. In sober housing, there's nobody cooking, just a few other guys around, doing their thing, no staff. You 'll be pretty independent. 126 Part 1, Chapter 2 Master Clinician Note: The counselor senses that Ren\u00e9 has begun a significant shift in his thinking about abstinence, relationships with others, personal attributes (e.g., responsibility , commitment ), and his own personal sense of worth and dignity. He has found hope that he can reach for and achieve a quality life. These shifts accrue as a result o f abstinence, stable living (such as stable housing and new \" clean\" friends), and quality treatment in the program. Ren\u00e9 still needs to incorporate these changes on a consistent basis but is making significant efforts in all these spheres. The counselor wants to support Ren\u00e9's new view of himself in relation to the world and will continue to reinforce this growth in subsequent visits. REN\u00c9: Y eah, but, I'm thinkin' he wants me to take the coffee commitment 'cause he thinks I'm gonna use if I don't take it . I'm saying I don't need to have a coffee commitment to keep me from using. C OUNSELOR: This is a big concern of yours right now. Someone else is relying on you. R EN\u00c9: Y eah, because now I can't miss. I know he thinks that it'll force me to have to go to the meetings. It gives me some responsibility, you know, so I'm gonna do it for a while. I can't say that I'm gonna be there for every meeting as coffee person, but I'm gonna try. C OUNSELOR: I think it's a good thing for you to do. You've been focused on yourself and your recovery, so now you're doing something for other people. It could be a good feeling, having peo\u00adple relying on you. R EN\u00c9: Well, maybe. C OUNSELOR: So, what else is going on? R EN\u00c9: Well, I need to make more money. The job \u2014I need a new job. I'm gonna try to buy me a car, you know, and I wanna move into my own place. COUNSELOR: Those are great goals, Ren\u00e9. So, have you tried to get leads on something that might offer more pay? R EN\u00c9: That's the thing, you know. I don't know how to look for another job. The folks at the halfway house said they would help. C OUNSELOR: Well, how about if we go back to the halfway house director, maybe on your day off, and see what he might have ? They have some stuff posted on the employment board. R EN\u00c9: Yeah, that's no t a bad idea. Master Clinician Note: The counselor is focusing on Ren\u00e9's natural supports (NA meetings, his job, and maybe his family) to help him develop supports for his recovery. COUNSELOR: Have you been in touch with your family at all? RE N\u00c9: Uh, no, not really. Been away from them a long time. 127 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless COUNSELOR: What do you think about making some contacts? Pretty soon , you'll have your own place. You can maybe have them over for coffee. Or are you thinking that would feel like too much pressure? [They discuss reconnecting to Ren\u00e9's family, particularly an uncle.] COUNSELOR: Now, I'm just thinking about another person who might show their face while you're in sober living . Who do you think that might be? RE N\u00c9: Let's see, who could that be? [ laughs] You're tal king about Cheryl. COUNSELOR: Y eah, I am. Have you thought about how that's going to work? REN\u00c9: Well, first, she don't know where I'm staying. You know, I'd never give her my address. Ha ven't given her my phone number either. I don't go to that store anymore. COUNSELOR: Have you been feeling lonely? REN\u00c9: Y eah, you know, that's part of why my sponsor had me go to those meetings a lot. Do esn't give me a chance to be lonely. I'm still around a lot of people I can talk to. COUNSELOR: You said you were not a real big people person, kind of a loner. REN\u00c9: Y eah, but I'm in the room with them, so, it's all right. Y eah, I saw a girl there and we've been talking. She's in recovery, too, so it's all right. COUNSELOR: Someone to think about for down the line. REN\u00c9: Could be. Could be a prospect, yeah. But, you know, I really want to change jobs. COUNSELOR: You changed the subject pretty quickly. Master Clinician Note: The counselor understands Ren\u00e9's abrupt shift to another topic as signaling his discomfort but decid es to further explore the relational issue and help him begin to resolve it. REN \u00c9: Ye a h. I 'm \u2014 CO UNSELOR: Maybe you need to think about how to deal with women who aren't using. REN\u00c9: Well, my sponsor told me that I shouldn't be in a relationship anyway, you know? COUNSELOR: This sponsor sounds like a very important person. REN\u00c9: Y eah, well, he thinks he is. He has some good information \u2014some good, some bad, some I d on't agree with. But I have his number , and then if something happens, he tells me don't call him after I get high, you know. Call him before. Can't really do too much after I'm high. COUNSELOR: So, it's been a while since you've been high. How's that going? RE N\u00c9: Going okay, you know? Got some good tools I use, you know. I do what they say ; I play the tape all the way through, I see the consequences. 128 Part 1, Chapter 2 COUNSELOR : There's a lot going on. You moved, you're still adjusting, there's another move coming, you're staying clear of Cheryl, you're seeing other women, and you're keeping off drugs. That's a lot. R EN\u00c9: Yeah, it's tough! C OUNSELOR: You've stayed with the plan on payday, you haven't relapsed, you're making the best of being here, you're doing more meetings, and you're maybe thinking about making some contact with your family.That's all really good stuff. R EN\u00c9: Y eah, well, it's pretty good. I guess they say I'm well on my way, huh? Master Clinician Note: The counselor continues to affirm Ren\u00e9's strengths and what he has accomplished. This supports Ren\u00e9's confidence in his ability to maintain his recovery and continue the evolution of his identity toward becoming a contributing member of his community and away from homelessness and substance abuse as a coping strategy. Summary Ren\u00e9 has come a long way. He slipped but worked with his counselor to stay i n the action stage of change through the techniques used in transitioning from homelessness intensive care to o n\u00ad going rehabilitation (i.e., affirmation, identifying strengths and relapse triggers, role -playing, and increasing and generalizing coping skills ). He moved from precontemplation to action for ending his relationship with his girlfriend and from contemplation to action about moving into a hal f\u00ad way house temporarily until he has enough time abstinent to enter a sober living home. He in\u00ad creased commitment to substance abuse recovery supports through involvement in NA. Longer -term goals for working with R en\u00e9 include: Ongoing engagement in mutual support groups and the recovery community. Reconnect ing him with his family, including using role- play to pra ctice asking his uncle to go fishing, having dinner with his aunt and uncle, and facing recriminations from his family. Finding a better job ; using r ole-playing of job interviews until Ren\u00e9 has developed the skills he needs for telling the truth about his background . Assessing Ren\u00e9's money management and living skills and improving them if necessary. Vignette 6 \u2014Mikki Overview Mikki is in the early intervention stage of homelessness prevention. This vignette demonstrates approaches and techniques for preventing additional trauma to her family during temporary homelessness. Mikki's partner of 4 years has abandoned the family, leaving Mikki with sole responsibility for their daughter, Emily, age 3, and for Madeline, age 7 , Mikki's daughter from a previous relatio n\u00ad ship. For a couple of months, he sent some money , but for the past 2 months he has not been heard from. Mikki does not know where he is and does not expect him to return. 129 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless She presents in the local community health center with one child with a high fever and both children with bad colds and coughs. On interviewing Mikki, the nurse practitioner picks up on her significant depression and begins to question her about the family's living situation. She is concerned that Mikki's level of depression will not allow her to provide care for the children, pa r\u00ad ticularly in emergency situations with their illness es. In the discussion, the nurse learns that Mikki has been evicted from their apartment and that the family has been living in her car (which is not working) for the past week. Mikki takes the olderchild, Madeline, to school each morning (except this morning , because Madeline is sick). She and the younger child, Emily, sit and play in the park all day. Mikki has no plans for coping withthe crisis and, with her depression, can barely make it from day to day. She has been receivingsome meals for her and the children at a local soup kitchen but has not told kitchen staff that she is homeless. The practitioner is faced with three immediate problems: 1. Intervening with the children's health problems 2. Intervening with Mikki's serious depression 3. Helping the family find temporary emergency housing The nurse contacts Bill, the behavioral health counselor/case manager at the community healthcenter. The vignet te depicts Bill's work with Mikki and the children. Setting Mikki and her two children present at a community health center. Bill, the caseworker, is called in after the nurse practitioner identifies the family as homeless and in need of acute care. Bill recognizes the complexity of this case, which, by his determination, calls for intensive case ma n\u00ad agement and a team approach to care. He mobilizes resources within the health center and in the community to respond to the complex needs of this family. Learni ng Objectives Recognize homelessness or incipient homelessness with individuals and families who present with other problems and do not identify homelessness as the presenting problem. Screen for and identify behavioral health problems and apply appropriate resources to address those problems. Mobilize and coordinate resources to provide interventions for complex, multiproblem families. Implement prevention strategies to limit the trauma of homelessness in families. Strategies and Techniques Case management with families facing multiple problems Using SBIRT as a strategy for identifying substance abuse and substance use disorders Prevention strategies to engage children and parents in families experiencing homelessness Using a team approach in working with f amilies with complex behavioral health issues Counselor Skills and Attitudes Develop rapport with someone who is depressed and overwhelmed . 130 Housing Options for Families in Crisis In any particular community, a variety of housing options might be available for families in crisis. At the same time, no community is likely to have the full range of nece ssary housing services for families. Some organizations may have a complete range of \"wrap -around\" services available, such as asser\u00ad tive community treatment, emergency and comprehensive health services, family counseling, em\u00ad ployment assistance, and a food pantry. Other organizations may simply provide housing. Some programs have restrictions on the length of time families may stay, whereas others provide perm a\u00ad nent supportive housing. Some resources may be limited to mothers and their children, whereas ot h\u00ad ers accept intact families. It is important for you and your program to be aware of the services available in your community, as well as to be aware of the gaps in available services. Part 1, Chapter 2 Develop and implement a treatment/recovery plan for people in acute crisis who have co- occurring disorders . Develop case management skills in work with complex, multiproblem families. Vignette Visit 1 (health center) The nurse practitioner has contacted Bill, a counselor who is currently seeing another client ; Bill says he can see Mikki in about 45 minutes. It ends up being more than an hour before Bill is free, and Mikki becomes cranky. Emily, who waits with her mother, is restless and beginning to run up and down the hallway near the waiting room. Madeline is still in the pediatrician's office. COUNSELOR : I'm sorry you have had to wait today. Things are pretty hectic around here this morning. MIKKI: Will someone tell me when Madeline is through with her visit to the doctor? COUNSELOR: Y eah, the nurse is going to call us. When she does, Madeline can join us here. I under stand Madeline is feeling pretty bad today. [Bill wants to initiate some connection with Mikki and involve her in a conversation but doesn't want to rush right into all of the overwhelming problems Mikki is facing. He engages Mikki intalking about the chi ldren's current health problems, and although Mikki continues to seem somewhat distant, she seems less cranky. Emily has put her head in her mother's lap and is b e\u00ad ginning to doze off. As Bill senses Mikki feeling a little more comfortable, he asks a genera l question about her current situation.] COUNSELOR: Mikki, it seems like you have a lot going on right now, some really tough stuff happening in your and your girls' lives. MIKKI: I don't know how I'm going to handle all of this. COUNSELOR: Well, we want to help you. Right now, Madeline is getting taken care of and Emily got a prescription from the doctor, so let's talk about your housing situation. I understand you don't have a place to live right now. MIKKI: Not since last Tuesday. 131 Family Shelters and the Need for Permanent Housing Shelter services provide emergency housing services to families without a place to live. Often, these services are limited to mothers and children who require immediate housing resources and are time limited in nature. A variety of dynamic s drive families to shelters and other transitional housing r e\u00ad sources: the lack of local low -cost housing, the disparity between housing costs and income, dome s\u00ad tic violence, and limited availability of other social service resources , among others . Some of the barriers faced by families who are homeless are available cash for a rental damage deposit and first and last months' rent, limited housing stock for larger families, and the reluctance of landlords to rent to individuals who have been previously evict ed from housing or who have a poor credit history. These dynamics create a cycle of emergency homelessness crises for families in need. Shelters and other transitional housing meet a significant need in most communities. However, shel\u00ad ters are often just the first step needed by a family without housing. Most housing experts cite the need for intensive long -term housing assistance for families to stabilize and grow beyond the imm e\u00ad diate crises that caused their homelessness in the first place. Supportive social services for emplo y\u00ad ment, behavioral health services , physical health care, education, clothing, and food are required over a longer period of time than can be provided by most transitional services. Housing First is an option for emergency shelter/transitional housing. As the name implies, this pr o\u00ad gram sees adequate and sustained housing as a precursor to support famil ies as they get back on their feet. In addition, Housing First services provide social services to support families. The f our stages of mo st Housing First programs are: crisis intervention and short -term stabilization, screening and needs assessment, provision of housing services, and provision of case management services. Source: National Alliance to End Homelessness, 2006. Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless COUNSELOR: Okay, Mikki. Let's take first things first. In addition to getting Madeline well, it seems most important right now that we help you get a place to stay for tonight that is safe and out of the weather. [Bill proceeds to gather the information necessary from Mikki to arrange temporary housing. He also explains to Mikki that , for tonight (and maybe the next few days), he will arrange shelter housing ; in the interim , they can plan for more stable housing. Bill also realizes that Mikki is d e\u00ad pressed and overwhelmed. It might be a problem for her to go to the housing office for asses s\u00ad ment on her own because her car is not working , but he has no immediate resources for taking her there. The office is about eight blocks from the health center. He therefore arranges for bus fare for Mikki and the girls.] MIKKI: I don't have any money. COUNSELOR: Mikki, I'm thinking if you can return here tomorrow, we'll start getting you some income support until you can get back on your feet and maybe start working. MIKKI: That sounds okay. [Madeline now enters the room accompanied by a nursing assistant from the pediatrics depar t\u00ad ment. She is a shy, thin child who does not make any eye contact with Bill. When the nursing assistant leaves the office, Madeline sits quietly next to her mother. Emily begins to stir, but Mi k\u00ad ki doesn't seem to respond to Emily's waking up.] COUNSELOR: Well, Mikki, if the kids are ready, maybe you should head over to the shelter 132 Part 1, Chapter 2 offices to arrange for housing for tonight. Then tomorrow, be back over here at 9, and let's see what we can do to start working on things like income and more stable housing. [Mikki bundles up the girls, takes the bus fare and a map to the shelter office, and leaves the health center with a return appointment for the next morning.] After Mikki leaves, Bill spends a few minutes developing some ideas for addressing Mikki's needs. Some o f the actions he identifies , in order of priority , are: 1. Find housing for the next couple of days, and, in the interim , arrange for more stable housing. 2. Arrange for the family to receive intensive case management and social work services from the health center that will allow Bill and other support personnel in the center to provide more concentrated and intensive services. 3. Address Mikki's depressive symp toms. 4. Find an income source that can support Mikki and her daughters until she can gain emplo y\u00ad ment. 5. Monitor the needs of the children ; in particular, monitor Madeline for school attendance and potential depression , ensure that the health and safety needs of both girls are met , and a r\u00ad range interventions to mitigate any trauma they may exper ience due to their life situation. 6. Help Mikki access resources she needs to apply for a job that can help her support her self and her children. Visit 2 (counselor's office) Mikki returns to the health center the next morning at 9 to see Bill. She is accompanied by her3-year-old, Emily. Madeline went to school this morning. Mikki looks disheveled, despondent, and overwhelmed and doesn't seem to be responding to Emily's efforts to stay close to her. After yesterday's visit, Bill requested and got approval for increased intensity of casework services. This allows Bill and a case aide to see Mikki on a more regular basis and to accompany her to a p\u00ad pointments that are criti cal to the family's welfare. Bill invites Mikki and Emily into his office . COUNSELOR: I hope you got to the housing office okay yesterday. How's it going? MIKKI: We got to the housing office yesterday after it closed, and the shelter wouldn't let us in without a voucher, so we slept in the car again last night. COUNSELOR: Did you and the girls get any breakfast? MIKKI: We had some supper at the open kitchen down the street from the housing office. I don't have any money for breakfast. COUNSELOR: Okay, then as soon as we finish here, I'll arrange a food voucher for you and Emily to get something to eat. Would it be okay with you if I call Madeline's school and see if we can arrange for her to get breakfast and lunch there each day she attends? [Mikki nods her assent to both statements , and Bill proceeds to complete a release of info r\u00ad mation form with her , which will allow him to communicate with the school counselor. Mikki signs the form without really reading it. Bill notices this and proceeds to explain what the form means.] 133 Effects of Homelessness on Children Children in families that are homeless are affected at all psychodevelopmental levels, from before birth to late adolescence. These effects in fluenc e physical growth, emotional and behavioral devel\u00ad opment, academic performance, and interpersonal and social skills development (Shegos, 1999). Additionally, homelessness for children, as well as for adults, rarely exists in isolation; rather, it occurs most often in the context of other dynamics such as the potential for violence, poverty, living with recurring crises, inadequate nutrition, and family breakup. As a result, children in families that are homeless are at particular risk for trauma and developmental and behavioral disorders. For more i n\u00ad formation on trauma -informed care for children and families who are homeless, see SAMHSA 's Na\u00ad tional C enter for Trauma site ( http:// www.samhsa.gov/nctic/ ) and site ( http://h omeless.samhsa.gov/ ). Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless COUNSELOR: Mikki, I sense that you are pretty down in the dumps this morning. MIKKI: Have you ever tried to live in a car with two daughters and one sleeping bag? I don't have any money. I'm tired. I don't know where we will sleep tonight . I haven't had a bath in 3 days. [Mikki begins to tear up. Bill just sits silently for a few moments without interrupting her.] COUNSELOR: I understand that things are really overwhelming for you right now. It must feel very difficult for you to get anything done. But I'm here to help you, and together , we can begin to take these big problems and deal with them one by one. Now first, I'm going to arrange for Kate, our case aide, to go with you this morning after you've had breakfast to enroll you and the girls in the family shelter housing program for a few days until we can get something betterworked out. It's safe, and you'll have a place for your stuff, a bathroom, and a small breakfast meal to get you all going in the morning. Once we have that squared away, Kate is going to walk over with you and Emily to the Depar t\u00ad ment of Human Services to help you get enrolled in some emergency financial assistance. It won't be a lot of money, but it will help you get through the next few weeks. Are these plans okay with you? MIKKI: Well, I don't have anything else to do, that's for sure. I do have to meet Madeline at th e school at 3. She gets real nervous if she thinks I'm not going to be there. COUNSELOR: No problem, we should be able to get the housing and income assistance stuff tucked away well before 3. Now, Mikki, there is one more thing I would like us to do this mor n\u00ad ing, and then we can arrange for you and Emily to get some breakfast \u2014and that is, I would like you to see a doctor on our staff, Dr. Wright. I know you are really overwhelmed and pretty downright now , and that is really sapping your strength. We're taking care of the girls' health, but your health is important, too. So, I want you to see Dr. Wright, who is our staff psychiatrist. Let's see what we can do to help you get more energy, get some good sleep, and feel more hopeful aboutthings.

Primary care centers, hospital emergency rooms, trauma centers, and other comm u\u00ad nity settings provide opportunities for early intervention with at -risk substance users before more s e\u00ad vere consequences occu r: Screening quickly assesses the severity of substance use and identifies the appropriate level of treatment. Brief intervention focuses on increasing insight and awareness regarding substance use and mot i\u00ad vation toward behavioral c hange. Referral to treatment provides those identified as needing more extensive treatment with access to specialty care. Please refer to the SBIRT Web page listed above as well as the text box on page 36 of this TIP for more information on SBIRT. Part 1, Chapter 2 MIKKI: You want me to see a psychiatrist? COUNSELOR: I'm concerned that you may be depressed, and , like any illness, depression is likely to get worse if it isn't treated. We have a lot of resources here at the health center that can help you, and Dr. Wright is one of them. [Mikki reluctantly assents. Bill takes a moment in the presence of Mikki to call Dr. Wright's sec\u00ad retary and arrange for an assessment interview later in the week. He then writes down the a p\u00ad pointment time for Mikki and arranges for her to come by his office for a few minutes before she is scheduled to see Dr. Wright. He then arranges for Mikki to receive two meal vouchers from the health clinic and schedules Mikki to meet Kate, the case aide, in 1 hour. While Mikki is ha v\u00ad ing breakfast, he updates Kate on the case. Kate will be able to check in with Mikki regularly justto make sure everything is going all right. He then calls Madeline's school and speaks with the school counselor, who suggests that, in addition to enrolling Madeline in the breakfast and lunchprograms, she can meet briefly with Mikki this afternoon when she comes to pick up Madeline and see what support she can offer Mikki and Madeline. Bill prepares his case notes and a referral request to Dr. Wright, describing his concerns about Mikki's depressive symptoms and the efforts that have been taken to support Mikki and her daughters.] Later in the week Mikki, with Kate's help, got housing through the family shelter, arranged for Madeline to remainin the school meals program, got emergency financial assistance, and kept her appointments with Bill and Dr. Wright. Dr. Wright suspected that alcohol use might be contributing to Mikki's d e\u00ad pression and conducted a n SBIRT assessment . The sc reening indicated that Mikki was using alcohol in a manner consistent with substance abuse, particularly in the past month. The brief intervention consisted of a discussion with Mikkiabout her alcohol use, helping her understand the ways in which alcohol might heighten her de\u00ad pression and interfere with her recovery. This elicited her cooperation in remaining abstinent 135 Transitional and Permanent Supportive Housing Two primary approaches to housing services include transitional supportive housing and permanent supportive housing. Transitional services are designed for people needing more than emergency housing assistance, but with an expectation that within a period of approximately 2 years, they will be able to move away from supported housing using their own resources. Many people are able to move from transitional housing sooner. Some examples of clients who often need transitional hous\u00ad ing are families whose major breadwinner has lost a job and been unable to find other employment, people who are homeless when leaving substance abuse treatment, and families affected by dome s\u00ad tic violence. Typically, transitional housing is accompanied by social, health, behavioral health, and other services to support the individual or family in rehabilitation from homelessness. Permanent supportive housing is more likely to be an appropriate choice for individuals who face long-term rehabilitation from homelessness and have co -occurr ing behavioral health or physical dis a\u00ad bilities. Permanent supportive housing needs to be accompanied by a variety of social, health, b e\u00ad havioral health, financial, occupational, and interpersonal services to enable the individual to function optimally in th e face of difficulties. In both transitional and permanent supportive housing, the type of appropriate housing depends on a variety of contexts , including housing availability in the community, the specific needs of the ind i\u00ad vidual or family, cost, and the availability of adjunct services. The housing may range from SRO units to conventional apartments in the community. Source: HUD, 2008. Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless while in treatment for depression and her participation in continuing follow -up with Bill. She was encouraged to attend a weekly support group that meets at the family shelter. Bill will follow up with Mikki on her efforts toward abstinence and monitor her mood. She has a return a p\u00ad pointment in a month to see Dr. Wright. Additionally, Dr. Wright prescribed an antidepressantmedication for Mikki. Visit 3 (one month later, counselor's office) Kate, with Bill's support and supervision, has continued to check in on Mikki twice a week. Mi k\u00ad ki's depressive symptoms are less intense, and she seems to be doing a better job of supportingher children. After spending four nights in the emergency family shelter, Mikki and the girls moved to transitional family housing, where they continue to live. Bill has maintained contact with Annette, the counselor at Madeline's school, who has helped Bill understand some of the effects of homelessness on young children and some of the programs and resources that are available for children to prevent additional, compounding problems.Through Kate, Bill has made time to see Mikki to check in with her before h er appointm ent with Dr. Wright. MIKKI: Hi . Kate said you wanted to see me. COUNSELOR: Hi, Mikki. It's good to see you again. Things were pretty tough for you the last time we were together. Kate has been keeping me updated; it seems things are going a lot better. MIKKI: Yes, they are. I need to get a job and a better place to live, but the girls are doing better. COUNSELOR: And you? How are you doing? 136 Part 1, Chapter 2 MIKKI: Well, better. I'm sleeping at night, even though the Family Living Center is loud and our room faces the street with traffic all night. I've got to find a better place to live, but that takes money. I'm also just sitting around all day. There isn't much to do. They don't like you downstairs watching TV all day. COUNSELOR: What about drinking? MIKKI: No drinking. When I saw the doctor, he told me I should quit, and the support group has helped a lot , too. I really couldn't afford it anyway. Mostly, I drank at night to sleep better, but I think I'm sleeping better now without drinking. My boyfriend drank every day, and I got todrinking with him. Now I'm through with him and the drinking. Master Clinician Note: The counselor decides to monitor Mikki's progress with not drinking as he continues to maintain contact with her ; he also wants her to have options for help if she does begin drinking again. COUNSELOR: What do you think would be helpful for you if you did find yourself drinking again? M IKKI: Well, I don't think that is going to happen, but I guess I would just stop. COUNSELOR: And if you find that despite your intentions, you can't stop? MIKKI: Well, could I give you a call? C OUNSELOR: Sure, I plan to be around a while. But also, if you aren't able to reach me, for i n\u00ad stance, maybe you've moved away, would you be willing to contact some resource in the comm u\u00ad nity that could help you \u2014for instance, a local alcoholism clinic or AA? M IKKI: Well, I really don't intend to start, but sure \u2014if I see that I'm drinking again, I can do that. Master Clinician Note: The counselor knows that Mikki would benefit from discussing how she would know when to seek help. He can also provide additional contact information that might come in handy in the future. He also wants to encourage Mikki to attend some AA meetings but decides to wait on that suggestion because of the multiple issues she still needs to address. COUNSELOR: Have you heard from your boyfriend? MIKKI: No, not a word. I don't know if he would even be able to find me now. I'm not wanting to find him right now , either. Maybe he was more of a problem than a solution. COUNSELOR: Well, Mikki, I'm really happy to see you doing so much better. We have a few minutes before your appoin tment with Dr. Wright, so I 'd like to talk with you about the girls. I know you've seen Annette, Madeline's school counselor, at least once since we last met. I talkedwith her last week. She would like to see Madeline get into some support programs if that's okay. MIKKI: What kind of programs are you talking about? 137 Evidence -Based Prevention Practices for Children SAMHSA's NREPP is an annotated list of programs for which there is empirical evidence of effectiv e\u00ad ness (see http:// nrepp.samhsa.gov/ ). Among those are the two to which Madeline has been referred . The Curriculum -Based Support Group Program is based on cognitive -behavioral and competence- enhancement models. It is designed to teach life skills and offer emotional support to help children like Made line cope with difficult family situations; resist peer pressure; set and achieve goals; refuse alcohol, tobacco, and drugs; and reduce antisocial attitudes and rebellious behavior. The school has prepared a workbook for parents of children in the group and will host a late afternoon parents' se s\u00ad sion with supervised games and activities for the children. The school's Coping Cat program combines summer camp activities with cognitive -behavioral treatment that assists school -age children in (1) recognizing anxious feelings and physical reactions to anxiety; (2) clarifying cognition in anxiety -provoking situations (e.g. , unrealistic expectations); (3) d e\u00ad veloping a plan to help cope with the situation (i.e., determining what coping actions might be effec\u00ad tive); and (4) evaluating performance and administering self- reinforcement as appropriate. Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless COUNSELOR: Well, one is an after -school program that runs until 6 each school day. It would help Madeline have a place where she could be with other kids after school. She would get a snack, have a chance to rest, and get her homework done. Annette says she also thinks she can get Emily into an afternoon preschool program that goes from 1 to 6 in the same building where Madeline would be. That would give you some time to yourself to begin getting things tog ether in your life. MIKKI: I could use some time to look for a job. What do I need to do about seeing this lady to get help for Madeline and Emily? COUNSELOR: While you're seeing Dr. Wright, I'll see if I can reach Annette. Maybe we can arrange a time for you to go by her office at the school. Why don't you check with the receptio n\u00ad ist's desk after seeing Dr. Wright? If I'm with someone else, I'll leave you a note there. If not, the receptionist will let me know you are available. [Mikki proceeds to Dr. Wright's waiting room. Bill calls Annette's office, and they arrange an appointment time for Mikki to visit with Annette tomorrow.] The next day Mikki arrives at Madeline's school about an hour before school is let out , and she meets with Annette. Annette does arrange after -school services for Madeline and also enrolls Emily in a f\u00ad ternoon preschool services. Annette also arranges for two other important services for Madeline: a support group similar to the Curriculum -Based Support Group Program she has read about and a summer program based on Coping Cat, which she saw on the Internet. Five months later Mikki drops by Bill's office while she is at the health center with Emily, who is getting immun\u00adizations. Mikki started out seeing Bill once a week for a couple of months, and then they d e\u00ad creased their visits to every other week. When she got a job, it became difficult to schedule appointments with Bill, so she began checking in via telephone. She is now working 6 hours aday as a housekeeper in a local upscale hotel. Emily is in child care while she works. The family 138 Coping With Work and Family Stress This workplace preventive intervention is designed to teach employees 18 years and older how to deal with stressors at work and at home. The sixteen 90- minute sessions, typically provided weekly to groups of 15 -20 employees, teach effective methods for reducing risk factors (stressors and avoi d\u00ad ance coping) and enhancing protective factors (active coping and social support) through behavior modification (e.g., methods to modify or eliminate sour ces of stress), information sharing (e.g., d i\u00ad dactic presentations, group discussions), and skill development (e.g., learning effective communic a\u00ad tion and problem -solving skills, expanding the use of social networks). The curriculum emphasizes the role of st ress, coping, and social support in relation to substance use and psychological symptoms. Usually, a facilitator with a master's degree who is experienced in group dynamics, systems theory, and cognitive and behavior interventions leads the sess ions. For m ore information, visit the NREPP Web site (http:// nrepp.samhsa.gov ) . Part 1, Chapter 2 last week moved into supported housing, a program for formerly homeless families. Mikki has continued to see the psychiatrist and a social w orker at the health center regularly and is much improved. She continues to maintain abstinence and is able to help Madeline with her hom e\u00ad work ; last weekend , the three of them went to a local community fair and had a great time. This weekend, they are shopping at local used furniture outlets for furniture for their new apartment.Mikki is taking advantage of a program offered by her employer (see text box above) to help pr e\u00ad vent her stress from becoming a barrier to her keeping her housing and maintaining abstinence. Long -range plans for Mikki and her children are: For Mikki to continue receiving treatment and support services at the local health center: - To stabilize in remission from her depressive episode. - To learn more about how to manage her recovery from her depression and alcohol use and to act early if she perceives a relapse coming. - To continue to develop better coping and parenting skills. To stay on the list for Section 8 housing and to move when this becomes available. For Mikki to continue to make plans with her parents to possibly return to her hometown (inthe same county) to live with her daughters. These plans would include contingencies for : - Local supported housing. - Continuing mental health services. - Signs of trauma reactions in the children related to what they have experienced in the past year. - Making plans to obtain long -term employment. - Maintaining abstinence from alcohol. Vignette 7 \u2014Sammy Overview Sammy is in the permanent supportive stage of h omelessness rehabilitation. The vignette show s approaches and techniques for arranging PATH -supported services and housing for a client who has SMI. Sammy, a 34 -year-old man, was discharged from the State hospital last week and referred to a community mental health center (CMHC) f or continuing care; he has yet to contact them. He 139 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless spent his first night after discharge with his parents but argued with them the next morning and left. He then spent several nights with a friend with whom he stayed occasionally before his ho s\u00ad pital admission. Last night , he had a few beers and was arrested for public intoxication, creating a disturbance, and panhandling. He spent the night in jail and this morning, as an alternative to incarceration, agreed to meet with the street outreach program staff. Street outreach in this community is a joint venture of a coalition of homelessness programs and the local CMHC. A f\u00ad ter the initial interview in jail with a mental health PATH caseworker, it was decided that Sa m\u00ad my would go with the caseworker to Welcome Home, a transitional housing program, and apply for long -term supported housing. The PATH cas eworker will follow Sammy's progress and help him transition to the community while maintaining housing at Welcome Home. Learning Objectives Use community housing and behavioral health resources to help an individual live in the community and avoid rehospi talization . Help client s learn about and access permanent supportive housing with support from the PATH staff . Provide client -directed, recovery -oriented services for housing . Integrat e community mental health services ( e.g., ACT) into a client's recovery program . Strategies and Techniques Engag e the client in community services to support recovery and get permanent supportive housing . Support the client in making housing decisions. Use community recovery resources (e.g., National Alliance on Mental Illness [ NAMI ]) to create ongoing recovery support . Counselor Skills and Attitudes Develop rapport with a client who does not easily engage with others. Manag e client resistance to accepting permanent supportive housing . Assess client strengths and limitations in developing a housing plan . Understan d community resources for housing for clients with SMI . Vignette Visit 1 (Welcome Home offices) Mike, a mental health caseworker, spent a few minutes developing rapport with Sammy, gather\u00ading some history and assessing his current life situation. This information revealed that Sammy has not had a permanent residence for nearly 4 years. He has lived primarily at a deer huntingcamp in the forest about 20 miles from his hometown. He maintains the camp for the hunters who o wn it in return for a room of his own there. When he comes to town by bus or hitchhiking , he may spend a night or two with his friend. He has had three admissions in the p ast 8 years to the State psychiatric hospital, all related to going off antipsychotic medications and using alcohol. Between hospitalizations , he has intermittently received care at the local CMHC. He doesn't like taking medication due to side effects but recognizes that he needs to take it to stay out of the hospital. 140 What Is PATH? Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness is a SAMHSA -administered formula grant program that funds community -based outreach, mental health, substance abuse, case management, and other support services for individuals who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless and have a serious mental illness or co- occurring disorder s. The program was authorized by the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1990. Monies are distributed by SAMHSA's Center for Mental Health Se rvices to Sta tes, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Terri\u00ad tories. States then distribute the monies to local programs to meet defined local needs. In this sense, each local PATH -funded program is different, reflecting the unique needs of the community it serves. For more information, visit the PATH Web site (http:// pathprogram.samhsa.gov/). PATH providers work with service delivery systems and embrace practices that work by: Partnering with Housing First and permanent supportive housing programs. Providing flexible , consumer -directed , recovery -oriented services to meet consumers where they are in their recovery. Improving access to benefits, especially through Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Outreach, Advocacy, and Recovery (SOAR). Employing consumers or supporting consumer -run programs. Partnering with medi cal providers, including Health Care for the Homeless and community health centers , to integrate men tal health and medical services. Improving access to employment. Using technology , such as hand -held devices, electronic records, and Homeless Management Information Systems. Training local provider staff on strategies to help people with serious mental i llness who are homeless. Local PATH-supported organizations provide homelessness support services, including: Outreach. Screening and diagnosis. Habilitation and rehabilitation. Comprehensive community -based mental health treatment. Alcohol and drug treatment. Case management. Supervision in residential settings. Services to help clients access appropriate housing. Part 1, Chapter 2 About 6 years ago , Sammy lived briefly in a group home, was involved in a local drop -in day pr o\u00ad gram supported by NAMI, and was able to work part time at a local carwash. Sammy says he prefers to live alone; living in the group home was \"t oo close\" for him. He felt too many pressures, and the staff 's expectations were too high. The v ignette starts with Sammy and Mike (the counselor) as they consider alternatives for housing . COUNSELOR: Sammy, let me see if I'm understanding you correctly. First, y ou need a place to live, at least for a while, because the guys at the deer camp say you need to prove you can do okay and stay o ut of trouble before you go back out there to live. Second, going home to your parents doesn't seem like a very good idea. Third, you need a place that you can call your own, without sharing a room, and lastly , you need a place you can afford. Am I correct about all of this? SAMMY: Pretty much. I don't want to go back to my parents' house or a group home. Been there. 141 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless COUNSELOR: Okay. Here's the way I see things. Let me know what you think. Number one is that we need a place for you to just hang your hat for a while until we can find a longer -term so\u00ad lution. SAMMY : [interrupting ] What do you mean, \"hang my hat for a while\"? C OUNSELOR: Just a place for you to stay, maybe a week, maybe longer, until we can help you find a place, arrange for financial support, ge t you hooked up with the ACT team at the mental health center. That sort of thing. SAMMY: I could just live with my friend until you find me a place. COUNSELOR: Remember that the judge this morning made finding adequate housing, getting involved with the mental health center, and getting settled in condition s for staying out of jail. SAMMY: I don't want to go back to that jail. Place smells. And it's noisy. COUNSELOR: Okay, Sammy, here's what I'm thinking. I know I can get you a room, at least for a week, at the local shelter. I was over there yesterday, and they have some room. Would you be willing to go over with me and take a look? SAMMY: Uh -huh. I guess so. COUNSELOR: Okay, just in summing up, let's see what we need to do from here. We're going to take c are of your housing for the next few days by going over to the shelter office. But also, if it is okay with you, I want to call Jeanette, who is on the ACT team at the com munity mental health center; let's get your appointment arranged. You've been through a tough 24 hours, and I want to be sure you have some support so you can minimize things turning tough again. Andthen we have to get you some money so you can buy a few things like a razor, and maybe a duffle to keep your meds and stuff. SAMMY: I've got some money; my parents gave me $100, and I still had about $35 when I left the jail this morning. COUNSELOR: Great! Maybe that'll last you for 2 or 3 days. The shelter will take care of your food. Now, I need your permission on a release of information form to call Jeanette. Is that okay? SAMMY: Uh -huh. [Mike proceeds to complete the release of information form and explains it to Sammy, who then signs in the presence of the housing office secretary and Mike. Mike then calls the shelter office to be sure someone will be available to meet with Sammy and him in about an hour. He thencalls Jeanette at CMHC in Sammy's presence, but she is unavailable and will return the call that afternoon. Mike and Sammy then proceed to the shelter office, where they arrange h ousing in an SRO se t\u00ad ting for the next week. Back at the office, Mike gets the call from Jeanette and makes an a p\u00ad pointment with Sammy for the ACT team tomorrow morning. He calls the shelter office, which passes the information about the appointment on to Sammy. Mike will accompany Sammy to his first visit at CMHC.] 142 What Is an ACT Team? ACT is an evidence- based practice (see http:// nrepp.samhsa.gov/ ) developed in the late 1960s. ACT (sometimes known as PACT) teams provide intensive, individualized care, including direct treatment, rehabilitation services, and support services to persons with chronic and persistent mental illness 7 days per week (some times 24 hours a day). ACT care is distinguished from traditional community mental health services in that ACT team members work collaboratively to provide most services. The client is a client of the team, not of an individual service provider. In traditi onal mental health trea t\u00ad ment, services are provided by a variety of different practitioners in a variety of settings, leading to fragmented and sometimes contradictory care. Team members in ACT include psychiatrists, ps y\u00ad chologists, social workers, licensed mental health counselors, nurses, rehabilitation counselors, and recently, peer counselors. Some principles of ACT, as identified by the Assertive Community Treatment Association, include: The ACT team is the primary provider of services. Services are provided in the client's environment, as well as in the ACT office. Services are highly individualized. ACT teams act assertively to encourage clients to participate in recovery. Services are provided over a long term. There is an emphasis on vocational services. The team provides substance abuse services and psychoeducation. Family support services are provided. Clients are supported in engaging and integrating into the community. Healthcare needs are addressed through education, evaluation, referral, and follow-up. Part 1, Chapter 2 Visit 2 ( meeting with the ACT team) Before meeting with the ACT team, Sammy and Mike spend a few minutes in the park across from CMHC. Sammy says that his room at the shelter is \"b etter than the jail, but not much.\" He is very interested in getting his own apartment as soon as possible. Mike agrees that they will meet tomorrow and begin working on finding an apartment through the PATH -supported ser\u00ad vices program. Mike is also concerned that Sammy needs a range of services to meet a variety ofneeds: housing, mental health treatment, something to do during the day, developing interpe r\u00ad sonal supports in the community, gaining income, achieving family reconciliation, ensuring pro p\u00ad er nutrition, obtaining transportation, and so on . No o ne program in the community can address all of these n eeds, and Mike will be the initial linch pin in coordinating these services. Mike begins to prioritize mentally how he will approach this task of coordination . As the ACT team engages Sammy, most responsibility for his care will be handed off to the ACT team ; Mike will begin to withdraw from active participation in Sa m\u00ad my's treatment. When it is time for Sammy's visit with the ACT team, Mike accompanies him across the street. Sammy first meets with Jeanette, an ACT team social worker, who completes the intake inter\u00adview. Sammy and Mike then meet with the entire ACT team, and they jointly come up with a short- term treatment plan that includes: Regular prescription medication and compliance monitoring by the ACT team with Mike's support. Daily contact with the ACT team Monday through Friday for the first month, with a plan to 143 What Is NAMI? NAMI is a nationwide voluntary organization with 1,200 affiliates throughout the United States that advocates for better understanding and resources for people with mental illnesses. It provides a vari e\u00ad ty of services and resources , including the NAMI Center for Excellence. Some basic services that might be provided in a community program supported by NAMI or another organ ization could i n\u00ad clude psychosocial skill training, mental health rehabilitation, case management, designated payee services, and drop -in services for clients and, possibly, their families. Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless taper contact to three times weekly in the second month, then once week ly after 3 months. Daily attendance at a local NAMI -suppor ted recovery group at CMHC for 3 months. Weekly attendance at a contemplation/preparation/action co-occurring disorders group at CMHC. Collaboration between Mike and Sammy in a transitional manner until Sammy is in perma\u00ad nent housing, then transfer of all services to the ACT team. Contact information for 24/7 access to the ACT team in case of any psychiatric emergencies. [Sammy, Mike, and the ACT team agree to the terms of the treatment plan , and all participants sign it. Sammy will begin the NAMI support group tomorrow morning and will check in withthe ACT team during his morning NAMI meeting. Mike makes an appointment with Sammy to meet the following afternoon to begin the application for a supported housing apartment. ] Visit 3 (counselor's office) Mike and Sammy meet to begin the application process for Sammy to obtain an apartment through the supported housing program. SAMMY: I don't like this shelter thing. People are everywhere, and they all talk too much. It's just like the group housing thing I was in back a few years ago! COUNSELOR : You seem to be getting uncomfortable with all the people. How are you ha n\u00ad dling that? SAMMY: Well, they make you leave the place by 9 in the morning, so I go over to the NAMI program. And then they won't let you back in until 4:30, so after NAMI is over, I just hang in the park. Don't know what I'll do if the weather gets bad. Then once I get back in the shelter, I justgo to my room. But I can still hear them through the walls. My room is right over the commun i\u00ad ty room. They've got that TV blaring , and then the people have to talk even louder. I don't like it. It's too loud. At the deer camp, I could go 3 days without hearing anything but the crickets. COU NSELOR : Sammy, I really understand that, and I know that i t's making you uncomfort a\u00ad ble. But I'm wondering if you can just hang in there until we can work out something better. Maybe have your own place in a week or 10 days. Could you do it? SAMMY: Well, do I have a choice? COUNSELOR : I don't know . What do you think? I hear that this makes you uncomfortable; remember that you and I, working together, are going to try to get you a better place as soon as we can. You're going to have lots of say in the place you get, where it is, how it looks. You'll even meet with the landlord before we close the deal. Meanwhile, you need to decide if you can hold 144 Part 1, Chapter 2 out until this lands, which it will. Let me ask you: In the past, when things hav e been noisy, what's worked best for you to deal with it? SAMMY: Well, I've had some beer. But I know I can't do that right now. Sometimes I put on headphones and listen to music. That helps sometimes. COUNSELOR : That sounds like a great idea to experiment with again. SAMMY: Okay. COUNSE LOR : Let's get some details about your housing needs, how you'll pay , and your pre f\u00ad erences. [Mike and Sammy continue to discuss the details of Sammy's housing needs. Sammy has co n\u00ad cerns about the neighbors, his privacy, rules that might be imposed on him, and who can access his apartment. Mike is concerned about public transportation availability , a cooperative landlord, finding an apartment in the rental range Sammy can afford, and the quality of the apartment.Mike encourages Sammy to apply for SSDI suppor t, and his lead clinician on the ACT team will participate in arranging for him to have an appointment to begin the process at the local Social Security office. A local NAMI recovery coach will also assist him in the process. This process can take 6 months to a year, and , in the interim, the local homelessness coalition will pick up the costs of Sammy's rent. After (if ) he is approved for SSDI, then 30 percent of his check will be applied toward the cost of the apartment. Likewise, if he doesn't receive SSD I, but finds another source of income, a portion of that income will go toward his rent.] Master Clinician Note: The kinds of information Mike might want to collect to help Sammy find a suitable apartment could include the following: 1. What area of town does Sammy want (or not want) to live in? 2. Is Sammy aware of any apartments that he thinks would be suitable? 3. What about bus routes or other available transportation in the area? 4. Are there grocery and other stores in the area that Sammy can use? 5. Are there laundry facilities in the apartment itself, in the apartment building, or nearby? 6. Can Sammy easily access his mental health service provider for appointments? 7. Are utilities included in the rent? If not, are there utility deposits, and who will pay the deposits? Visit 4 (in the community) The next day, Sammy and Mike go apartment hunting among the apartments approved by the local affordable housing program. They look at several furnished units, each having some disa d\u00ad vantages for Sammy's particular situation. The fifth apartment visited seems to meet Sammy's needs and seems to Mike like a good match. It is an upstairs one -bedroom unit in a building with seven other apartments, about six blocks from CMHC, and it's near a gro cery store . The unit has a small , parklike lawn in front, is on a bus route, and seems secure.The basement i n\u00ad cludes a washing machine and a clothes dryer. It has minimal but acceptable furnishings. Sammy was initially concerned that there was no TV but then said he thought his parents would let him have the old TV from his room at their home. The rent is $400 a month, which is within the 145 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless range of affordability for the housing program. There are two other units rented to participants in the PATH housing supports program. Master Cli nician Note: The counselor needs to know how housing is approved or preapproved for supportive housing programs. All supportive housing programs investigate potential housing units prior to their eligibility in the program. Most programs have Housing Quality Standards criteria that must be met. The program is also likely to want statemen ts from the owner s of the available unit s that they are willing to work with the housing program. Before signing a lease, renter s need to have a clear understanding of a variety of issues: for instance, whether the lease will be in the name of the program or the client, whether there is a deposit and how much it is, whether utilities are included in the rent, whether smoking is allowed in the apartment, arrangements for pest control, and whether there are rules about visitors. Many programs must complete a HUD -required Rent Reasonableness Survey to ensure that the rent is in line with community standards. Sammy and Mike meet with the apartment manager, who lives in an apartment on the second floor adjacent to the unit Sammy will rent. He mentions that he would like to help Sammy andthat he himself was a patient at the State psychiatric hospital several years ago and, after obtain\u00ading housing in the building, had become the manager about 3 years ago. Sammy, although a bit distant, seems to like him. The manager is interested in how Sammy will spend his day, goes overthe basic rules of the apartment building, and offers to help Sammy get settled in. After the meeting with the apartment manager, Sammy and Mike sit for a few minutes on a bench in front of the apartment unit. SAMMY: So, when can I move in? COUNSELOR : Well, here are some things we need to do first: [ Sammy sits quietly. ] Firs t, do you think it would be a good idea to let your parents know what's up? SAMMY: Yeah, I can give them a call. They were paying my cell phone bill while I was in the hospital , and I have it back, so I can call them. COUNSELOR : Maybe they would like to se e the place. SAMMY: Nah. They don't need to see it. COUNSELOR : Okay, well, what else do you need to do to get moved in once we have ever y\u00ad thing arranged on our end ? SAMMY: I don't know. Move the little stuff I have, I guess. I'll get Mom to give me some dishes and kitchen stuff. I can cook and they'll give me a little money to buy some food \u2014pasta and that kind of thing. I don't eat much. This medicine makes me fat if I eat too much. COUNSELOR : What about sheets, toilet paper, that sort of thing? SAMMY: Well, I know I can't keep my mom from coming over here, once she knows where I'm living, and she'll bring that stuff. 146 Part 1, Chapter 2 COUNSELOR : Okay, now, you'll be going to the NAMI Recovery Program every day, and, for now at least, you'll be checking in with the ACT team. Every week, you get your meds from them. I think you are all set, Sammy. Visit 5 (NAMI Recovery Program facility) Ten days later, Mike checks in with Sammy while he is attending the NAMI Recovery Program. Sammy has moved into his new apartment and watched a football game with Frank, his apar t\u00ad ment manager, last evening. He has made some acquaintances with other participants in the NAMI Recovery Program. Sammy and Mike find a quiet corner to visit for a few minutes. SAMMY: I'm going to go out to the deer camp for a few days next week. COUNSELOR : What about your participation in this recovery program and your ACT team visits? SAMMY: What about ' em? COUNSELOR : Well, my understanding of our agreement is that you are supposed to partic i\u00ad pate in these programs every day. [Sammy doesn't answer , and there is a long pause.] COUNSELOR : So, Sammy, let's see. If I understand you correctly, you want to go visit the deer camp, and we need to find a way for that to happen that doesn't interfere with your ACT team involvement and your participation in the NAMI Recovery Program. How do you envision doing that? SAMMY: I'm just going for a few days \u2014to check on things. COUNSELOR : And you would be going by yourself? SAMMY: Yeah, I'll take a bus out. They let me out at the old road to the camp and then I walk the last mile or two. COUNSELOR : And Mr. Devereaux, the head of the deer camp group , knows you're coming? SAMMY: Nah, but he doesn't mind. We're friends. COUNSELOR : Well, Sammy, I see a couple of problems. First, our agreement calls for you to not miss daily contact with the ACT team for your first 30 days and for you to not miss NAMI meetings. Second, I think we at least need to talk to Mr. Devereaux and let him know you 're planning to go out to the camp, how long you'll be ther e, how you would get into the building, that sort of thing. [Sammy agrees to give Mr. Devereaux a call in Mike's presence. Mr. Devereaux greets Sammy warmly, but reminds him that he left the deer camp \"in a mess\" and that he can only return when others are there and the mental health center has given its approval . Following the call, Mike and Sammy agree that Sammy will defer the visit to the camp for a few months. Sammy is disa p\u00ad pointed but accepts the decision. Mike acknowledges Sammy's disappointment and supports his 147 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless trying to make it work by clearing it carefully with Mr. Devereaux as well as his continuing pa r\u00ad ticipation in his recovery efforts.] Three months later (follow-up) Sammy has been active in NAMI now for 3 months. Working with the ACT team, he has ma n\u00ad aged to balance the amount of medicine he takes so that it can control his symptoms while not making him feel \"dopey.\" Mike is tapering off his involvement with Sammy, transitioning respo n\u00ad sibilities to the ACT team. Sammy has made a couple of friends through the NAMI Recovery Program and, with the help of the ACT team , has found part -time employment with a local moving company. He is also planning to enroll in a course on electronics repair at the community college next month. A core element of his recovery has been his ability to maintain supportedhousing, which gives him an element of independence yet continues his access to treatment. The combination of PATH support, supportive housing, mental health services at CMHC, NAMI rehabilitation services, and interim financial support has given Sammy a strong foundation for recovery. Summary Sammy has a history of SMI and was at significant risk of relapse before adequate supportive housing was made a part of his recovery plan. It is also essential that he continue to be engagedwith local community behavioral health resources, such as the local ACT team and NAMI. He was able to accept temporary housing in a shelter until permanent supportive housing was a r\u00ad ranged and, with a supportive landlord and community resources, has made a good transition to the community. 148 Part 2: An Implementation Guide for Behavioral Health Program Administrators 149 150 IN THIS CHAPTER Introduction Developing Services for Clients Who Are Homeless The Housing First Approach Challenges in Adapting Programs To Address the Needs of People Who Are Homeless Modifying Behavioral Health Services To Meet the Needs of Clients Wh o Are Homeless Interacting With Community Resources To Build a Continuum of Care Collaborative Partnerships Internet Resources Integrating Behavioral Health Services With a Community System of Homelessness Services Building Linkages Among Services Funding Community Homelessness Services Part 2, Chapter 1 Part 2, Chapter 1 Introduction Part 2 of this Treatment Improvement Protocol (TIP ) is directed to administrators and senior staff persons and is designed to pr e\u00ad pare you to help behavioral health staff persons in their work with clients facing homelessness and the specific challenges that home\u00ad lessness presents. It can serve as a resource for you to use as you support and challenge your staff to become part of a community - wide response to the problem of homelessness. How can you sup\u00adport your staff members in these efforts? Do they need further training? What additional services and collaborative arrangementsdoes your organization need? Where does funding come from?What do model programs look like? It is important to emphasize that homelessness is a problem that deserves the attention of behavioral health organizations. Some of the clients your program is currently treating may be homeless or at high risk of becoming homeless within months of their discharge from the program. People who are homeless report more problems related to alcohol use, drug use, and mental disorders than those who a re not homeless. Findings from studies of Midwest urban samples of people in shelters, food programs, or living on the streetreport high rates of problems related to substance use (58 percentof women ; 84 percent of men [North, Eyrich, Pollio, & Spitznage l, 2004]; 55 percent of women ; 77 percent of men [Forney, Lomba r\u00ad do, & Toro, 2007]). A meta -analysis studies do ne between 1979 and 2007 (Fazel, Khosla, Doll, & Geddes, 2008) revealed a pooled prevalence rate among homeless men for alcohol and substance dependence of37.9 percent (10 studies) and 24.4 percent (7 studies), respectively.Providing adequate shelter for people who are homeless can be thefirst step toward engaging in behavioral health treatment. Trans i\u00ad tional supportive and permanent supportive housing provid ed 151 152 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless by either behavioral health programs or other programs in the community have become i n\u00ad tegral components of recovery promotion inboth mental health and substance abuse treatment. (See the online literature review inPart 3 of this TIP for more details.) Why Is an Implementation Guide Part of This TIP? Part 1 of this TIP provid es the knowledge and many of the tools behavioral health workers in your program will need for working with peo\u00adple who are homeless and those facing the immediate threat of homelessness. But wit h\u00ad out specific attention to program development,staff support, and specific implementationstrategies, the tools your counselors have d e\u00ad veloped are likely to go unused or will be usedineffectively. Part 2 will give you, in your role as program administrator or senior staff per\u00ad son, ideas and strategies for program de velop\u00ad ment and implementation to supportprogramming for clients in behavioral healthtreatment who are homeless or at risk of b e\u00ad coming homeless. Programming for people who are homeless and have behavioral health issues occurs in a variety of settings: criminal justice programs,homelessness programs (e.g., shelters, outreachservices, permanent supportive housing ser\u00advices, intensive rehabilitation environments),community assistance programs, community health centers, and other community settings,in addit ion to more traditional behavioral health programs. Although this TIP is d i\u00ad rected primarily at professionals working in more traditional programs, much of the i n\u00ad formation will also be useful to administrators and senior staff members in other settings serving people experiencing homelessness and substance use or mental disorders. Developing Services for Clients Who Are Homeless Your behavioral health program may be inter\u00ad ested in serving people who are homeless or atrisk of becoming so for a number of reas ons, many of which also apply to homelessness programs that want to develop or expand ser\u00advices for clients with mental illness and/orsubstance use diagnoses. First, serving people with substance abuse and mental disorders who are homeless often is not a m atter of choice. The clients are there! Implementing specific programmatic elements to meet the ir needs serves to make interven\u00ad tions more successful and cost -effective. It also enables staff to work more efficiently. In this sense, specialized homelessness services are anessential ingredient for quality and effective care in your organization. Many of the clientsyou serve are not homeless when they come into treatment but, for a variety of reasons, b e\u00ad come homeless during treatment and have no place to live once they complete intensive treatment. Other clients receiving behavioral health services are just one paycheck or one personal or family crisis away from homeless\u00adness. Still others enter treatment because they need shelter. Having a staff with the know ledge and skills to anticipate and address these issues will help your program run more smoothly and with better outcomes. As the behavioral health field moves toward outcome -based funding, serving clients more efficiently becomes a higher priority. Whenprogram staff members are aware of the effects of homelessness on treatment, not only does itlessen problems associated with housing inst a\u00ad bility ; it also reduces the severity of social and behavioral crises that interfere with treatment. This, in turn, increases staff efficiency and cli\u00ad ent retention. 152 Part 2, Chapter 1 Additionally, making homelessness services a priority for your program will increase the c a\u00ad pacity of the program and the skills of the clinical staff responding to various other social and health needs your clients may have, suchas transportation services, health care, financial management, and responses to criminal justice issues. In this sense, programming for home\u00adlessness benefits all clients, not just those whoare currently or potentially homeless. Specific services for homelessness may be an opportunity for your program to find add i\u00ad tional sources of funding to support client ser\u00ad vices. A variety of community fundingresources are available to address the needs of people who are homeless, particularly those in need of behavioral health services. These add i\u00ad tional funding streams can help stabilize yourfunding base and incr ease your program's c a\u00ad pacity to meet the needs of clients. Some people in the community may question the costs for intensive and supportive care forpeople who are homeless and whether the benefits of such care are cost -effective. The reality is that supportive housing is cost - effective when compared with alternatives.The Corporation for Supportive Housing(CSH) report, Costs of Serving Homeless Ind i\u00ad viduals in Nine Cities (The Lewin Group,2004), presents estimates of the costs of ser v\u00ad ing people who are homeless in various se t\u00ad tings: supportive housing, jails, prisons, shelters, psychiatric hospitals, and acute carehospitals (Exhibit 2 -1). Estimates represent the average cost of providing 1 day of service to an individual in each setting and capturethe und erlying costs of providing services, compared with the payments received from public payers . The CSH report defines sup\u00ad portive housing as a combination of program - building features and personal services to en a\u00ad ble people to live in the community. The Housin g First Approach One of the first decisions you will make in d e\u00ad veloping services for people who are homeless is whether a Housing First approach is suit a\u00ad ble for the clients you expect to serve and for your community . Housing First approaches are used to engage people into services who are homeless and have behavioral health cond i\u00ad tions . They are low demand, offer permanent housing for people who are homeless, and donot require the client to enter treatment ordocument abstinence. Many, though not all,Hous ing First participants receive Federal dis\u00ad ability benefits, and many programs encourage clients to participate in money managementprograms that ensure payment for housing.Housing First programs provide substance abuse, mental health, and medical servicesthrough community case management or mul\u00adtidisciplinary teams. Clients choose which Exhibit 2 -1: Range of Estimated Service Costs per Day by Setting Setting Cost per Day Supportive housing $20.54 (Phoenix, AZ) \u2014 $42.10 (San Francisco, CA) Jail $45.84 (Phoenix, AZ) \u2014 $164.57 (New York , NY) Prison $47.49 (Atlanta, GA) \u2014 $117.08 (Boston, MA ) Shelter $11.00 (Atlanta, GA) \u2014 $54.42 (New York , NY) Psychiatric se r\u00ad vice hospital $280 (Phoenix, AZ) \u2014 $1,278 (San Francisco, CA ) Acute care hospital $1,185 (New York, NY)\u2014 $2,184 (Seattle, WA ) Range s established across: Atlanta, Boston , MA Chicago , CA; and Seattle, WA. Source: The Lewin Group, 2004. 153 154 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless services to receive. More information about these programs is available on the Corporation for Supportive Housing Web site (http://www.csh.org ). Housing First programs demonstrate substa n\u00ad tial enrollment into services and housing st a\u00ad bility for individuals who are chronically homeless and have long -standing mental il l\u00ad ness and, in most cases, substance use diso r\u00ad ders (Pearson, Locke, Montgomery, Buron, & McDonald, 2007). Enrollment status is d e\u00ad termined more by continued contact with case managers and other service providers and less by whether the client is continuously residingin program housing. Temporary departures from housing are not uncommon; program staff continue to follow up with clients evenwhen they are away from their housing. Many programs hold units for up to 90 days and en\u00ad courage clients to return. Housing First programs range from scattered - site independent housing leased from private landlords (thus increasing individual choice inboth housing and neighborhoods) to congr e\u00ad gate living programs in which the programowns or controls the housing (allowing staff toprovide a high level of onsite supervision andresponse to client crises). Staff members are available around the clock to help clients maintain their housing and meet their otherneeds. Implementing Housing First models in sub\u00ad urban or rural areas can present challenges that require modifications to the model. Staff\u00ad ing may need to be composed of smaller teams resembling assertive community treatment(ACT) teams , which maintain low caseload ratios and broker some services from comm u\u00ad nity providers. Teams can feature interdiscipl i\u00ad nary staff from different organizat ions. Resources may be needed to purchase or use extra vehicles. Housing choices may be r e\u00ad stricted to renting a room in someone's home, sharing a house, or waiting until a single unit is found. (For descriptions of Housing Firstprograms, see U.S. Department of Housingand Urban Development [HUD], 2007b.) Communication among staff members is often accomplished through daily team meetings sothat they can respond immediately to clientneeds. Many programs also have automateddocumentation services for collecting info r\u00ad mation on client status and outcomes. Funding for Housing First programs comes from diverse sources. The programs seek Med\u00adicaid reimbursement for mental health case management services and State or county funding for clinical services. Additiona l sources of funding might include foundations and other private sources. HUD assistance programs provide rental assistance. State orlocal funds may cover short -term stays in a hotel while a client seeks housing, or rental assistance may be provided to clients who are ineligible for HUD assistance programs. These programs often use a representative payee system to handle clients' income. This is a money -management system that assigns a third party to handle disbursement of funds for individuals receiving Supplemental Secur i\u00ad ty Income or Social Security Disability Insu r\u00ad ance (American Association of Community Psychiatrists, 2002). It is often a practical needand helps people develop independent livingand money management skills. Many Housing First programs strongly en\u00ad courage representative payee arrangements for certain clients. People with representative pa y\u00ad ees at baseline are more likely to stay housed(HUD, 2007b ). Although representative payee arrangements can be a valuable intervention for individuals who are severely disabled, you and your staff should carefully consider poten\u00ad tial consequences of removing client respons i\u00ad bility for deciding how and when to spend 154 Part 2, Chapter 1 money. Power struggles can result when a cli\u00ad ent's request for money is denied to coverhighe r priority needs (e.g., when the request conflicts with paying rent). One way to reduce power struggles is to have personnel otherthan the counselor act as the \" banker,\" permi t\u00ad ting the counselor to work more effectively with the client on money management skills. For more on representative payee arrang e\u00ad ments, see the Social Security Administration's Web site (http://www.socialsecurity.gov/ payee/ ). Unless you do adequate groundwork, the pr o\u00ad cess of establishing a Housing First program may run into unexpected obstacles. First, it is important to separate a client's clinical issues from his or her responsibilities as a housingtenant (Stefancic & Tsemberis, 2007). This may represent a significa nt change for staff. One challenge in implementin g Housing First programs is the presence of preexisting agency policies that couple housing with requirements that the client maintain abstinence . Rigid, ri g\u00ad orous housing eligibility requirements that o f\u00ad ten discri minate against clients with psychiatric symptoms or substance abuse c an also be cha llenging . Housing First programs usually accept clients on a first -come, first - served basis. Another challenge is ensuring collaborative agreements with the immediate neighborhoodwhere any congregate facility is to be located.Steps toward collaboration include: Involvement of neighborhood associations or boards on the board of advisors for the program. Development of a good neighbor code ofconduct. Development of shared responsibility inuse and maintenance of public resources (such as parks or gardens) . Rapid response to security or sanitary i s\u00ad sues, including police attention. Challenges in Adapting Programs To Address the Needs of People Who Are Homeless You may decide to add homelessness rehabili\u00ad tation services to your existing programmingrather than choosing a Housing First a p\u00ad proach. When you decide to implement sp e\u00ad cialized homelessness programming in yourbehavioral health organization, you will findsome special challenges, the solutions to whichcan be ultimately producti ve for your program. Still, to institute new services, you must over\u00ad come several hurdles. It is imperative to conceptualize, develop, and i mplement services for homelessness in the context of your current programming. In ef\u00ad fect, the new services need to be natural add i\u00ad tions that complement existing programs. Not to do this would mean having a unique home\u00adlessness program that is not integrated but r a\u00ad ther a separate, isolated entity. In this con text, the new service elements have to be concept u\u00ad alized in response to the question \" How can this new service integrate with and compl e\u00ad ment the services we already offer?\" Sec ond, instituting a new service component for homelessness in your behavioral he alth program means staff development to confrontthe myths about people who are homeless, the services they need, and how the services canand should be provided. Staff developmentmay mean additional skills development orenhancing and specializing skills that already exist among staff members, who will need tolearn about additional resources in the co m\u00ad munity and how to collaborate with the o r\u00ad ganizations and people that provide them. They might need cross -training to work with the specific needs of people who are homeless while maintaining their skills in behavioral 155 156 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless health services. Working with homelessness may require case management and outreachskills un familiar to most of the staff. For i n\u00ad stance, behavioral health counselors working with clients who have substance use disorders may end up doing outreach with clients who show no interest in changing substance use patterns; mental health workers may feel un\u00ad easy at first seeing clients in settings other than their office. You and your staff will need to interact with a different network of community services. Pr o\u00ad grams primarily addressing homelessness in the community may have a different orient a\u00ad tion to services. For instance, programs forhomelessness m ay have a so cial service orie n\u00ad tation; behavioral health pro grams, a health - care-focused perspective. Rehabilitation in homelessness programs may be more orientedto life skills development , whereas behavioral health program s focus on treatment and sp e\u00ad cific psychological strengths. Thus , community programs created for homeless populations may have different goals, staffing patterns, funding streams, or client goals. Behavioral health program administrators, who often are more experienced in working in the health,substance abuse, and mental health field s, should recognize these different perspectives and view them as strengths, not impediments. In addition to formal relationships among or\u00ad ganizations, an informal system of community involvement, interorganizational relationships,and services planning is required to bridge gaps between traditional behavioral health andhomelessness services. Later in this chapter,the discussion of collaborative partnerships and service modification highlights this issue. Special Needs of Behavioral Health Clients Who Are Homeless Most clients who are homeless and need sub\u00ad stance abuse or mental health treatment ( and many clients in substance abuse or mental health treatment who enter treatment without housing or become homeless during trea t\u00ad ment) have needs distinct from those of other clients. Some problems may resemble those experienced by many clients but differ in se\u00adverity and incidence. These problems extendbeyond lack of housing and include psychiatricimpairments, drug use, financial mismanag e\u00ad ment , criminal justice issues, and healthcare needs. Thus, special program elements may need to be developed. These include outreachand client retention programs, specialized case management efforts, and treatment planningand approaches that integrate life skills devel\u00adopment and s pecialized resources for relapse prevention and recovery promotion. Different Clients, Different Needs The three groups of clients who are homeless,as defined in Part 1, Chapter 1, present differ\u00adent needs to your program. Some clients are homeless for the first time in their lives. Your program needs policies and procedures toguide counselors and clinical supervisors inhelping in these emergencies. Clients who are transitionally homeless and are recoveringfrom substance use disorders may benefit from transitional living facilities , such as Oxford Houses, described in Part 1, Chapter 1, of this TIP . Most communities have a variety of es\u00adtablished resources for clients who are transi\u00adtionally homeless. For instance, the SalvationArmy, along with other faith -based resources, offers services for the transitionally homeless in many communities. These resources are es\u00ad pecially valuable for families facing the crisis of first -time homelessness and can serve to prevent the development or exacerbation ofother psych osocial and health problems. Clients who are episodically homeless needclinical workers who recognize and focus on the stressors that caused the homeless episode.Administrators need to have established 156 Part 2, Chapter 1 linkages with such community resources as vocational rehabilitation, employment r e\u00ad sources, financial and health services, and ot h\u00ad er community resources so that people who are episodically homeless can quickly get back on their feet once they are stabilized and on arecovery path. It is useful for administra tors to have open conduits to local entitlement agen\u00adcies ( e.g., Social Security , public assistance) and to ensure that counselors are well trained to negotiate these systems to help clients incrisis obtain or maintain the financial support s to which they are entitled. Clients who are chronically homeless are often the most visible subgroup of people experien c\u00ad ing homelessness in a community. They alsomay be beset with the widest variety of co - occurring mental health, health, financial,criminal justice, and employment issues in a d\u00ad dition to their homelessness. Seldom is a community behavioral health program capable of addressing all of the needs of people whoare chronically homeless; thus, they must de\u00ad pend on linkages with housing, medical, ent i\u00ad tlement, and other resources to begin to bringstability to the lives of these clients. Regardless of the housing status of your pr o\u00ad gram's clients at intake, it is important to build in resources for eliciting housing information early in treatment to ensure that potential or actual homelessness does not present as a crisis when a client prepares for discharge. Modifying Behavioral Health Services To Meet the Needs of Clients Who Are Homeless To serve people who are homeless, your orga n\u00ad ization can adapt its programs to provide se r\u00ad vices that were not previously available. These service modifications to meet the needs of people who are homeless take different routes based on knowledge about the target popula\u00adtion. A bottom -up approach to service modif i\u00ad cation (described below) begins by evaluatingthe needs of the people who will receive the services. In a top -down approach, the impetus for change comes from administrators, boards of directors, funding resources, and the like. Ifyou are unfamiliar with your community's homeless population, a bottom -up approach is best; top -down integration works best when you know the population well and can assess in advance the major barriers to care and thebroad initiatives needed to overcome them. Top-down modificat ions often require some bottom -up information to make the right choices. You can tentatively commit to a planbut then engage in community discussion b e\u00ad fore acting, making modifications as necessary. Bottom -Up Service Planning Bottom -up service planning is a process of using peer workers, case managers, clinicians,supervisors, and administrators to develop aprogram that meets identified needs of a sp e\u00ad cial client population . It oft en starts with a few unique, complex cases \u2014for example, develo p\u00ad ing services for people who often use eme r\u00ad gency shelters, emergency rooms (ERs), ordetoxification centers. The project scale in\u00ad creases incrementally as effective practices are established and resources become available. The first stage of bottom -up service integr a\u00ad tion is to identify the target population and engage people in services and then developfeedback mechanisms to identify what works and how to improve program efficiency. Ask people from the target population about theirpriorities informally or via surveys o r focus groups. The National Health Care for the Homeless Council Web site (http://www.nhchc.org/advisory.html ) offers a manual for involving a formal consumer adv i\u00ad sory board. 157 158 Exhibit 2 -2: Key Components for Bottom -Up Modification 1. Sense of urgency. Frontline staff may fear that failing to engage people in services will lead to victimization on the streets, untreated physical illness, or deteriorating life situations. This fear propels the staff into a sense of urgency about helping people get the services they need. 2. Support personal responsibility. Clinical supervisors and administrators support the frontline staff in embracing personal responsibility for the advocacy for each case. This includes unde r\u00ad standing the staff's experiences and providing flexible support (e.g., willingness to modify team structures) so the staff can more easily accomplish its work. 3. Negotiate, collaborate, and advocate. Frontline staf f members , supervisors, and administrators who are committed to providing services to the target population negotiate, collaborate, and advocate with other service providers to meet each client's needs. Interorganizational partner\u00ad ships facilitate this thro ugh joint supervision of day -to-day activities. 4. Hold w eekly frontline staff meetings . Case managers, clinicians, and supervisors meet weekly to capture the collective wisdom gained in this learning process and channel their enthusiasm i n\u00ad to understanding how to do the work effectively. They discuss and develop methods to address missed opportunities to connect with other service providers and potential clients. 5. Hold monthly administrator meet ings. You and other administrators discuss the learning pr o\u00ad cess a nd set principles of practice and procedures as needed (e.g., through case descriptions, understanding barriers to services and missed referrals, advocating for access to services on a case-by-case basis with State administrators). You'll gain a better und erstanding of the work by meeting clients and providing some direct services. 6. Include appropriate partners. As you identify new service needs and resources in your organiz a\u00ad tion or in the community, include appropriate partners in the learning process. 7. Obta in new funding resources. New funding allows the project to serve more clients. So urces: Rowe, Hoge, & Fisk, 1996, 1998. Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Collaborating with partners to identify and engage the target population Bottom -up service modification can be a co l\u00ad laboration between nongovernmental organ i\u00ad zations (NGOs) or between programs within an NGO. The first step is small but dynamic:collaborating with other service provide rs who can help identify your target population andintroduce you to new clients. These collabor a\u00ad tions can be informal or formal. Document a\u00ad tion at this stage is simple: tracking where people are identified and their progress through the system. Exhibit 2 -2 lists some helpful elements in bottom- up modification. How do you perform bottom-up services modification? Step 1: Perform a needs assessment . The needs assessment includes gathering data not only on the demographics and expressed needs of t he homeless population to be served, but also on how those services can be most effectively delivered, which services seem to result in cli\u00adent change, and which servi ces can be offered over time (see needs assessment steps listed on p. 164). St ep 2: Get internal buy -in. Take your needs assessment to the CEO, chief clinical officer,and/or board members and develop a plan forhow to proceed that includes identifying p o\u00ad tential funding sources, stakeholders, staffmembers, and services that can reasonably be added to drive the initiative. St ep 3: Make contact with funding sources. Or\u00ad ganization administrators seek funding tomeet the needs of the population. Once the possibility of funding exists, go to Step 4. S tep 4: Identify stakeholders . Identify other pa r\u00ad ticipants in your effort , begin ing with your clinical staff and fellow administrators. Other 158 Part 2, Chapter 1 potential stakeholders include: Your board of directors. The local continuum of care (housing pr o\u00ad viders; mental health, substance abuse, and medical treatment providers; hospita l emergency departments; and staff mem\u00adbers of criminal justice programs). Local business owners and legislators wi th whom your organization has strong rel a\u00ad tionship s. Program alumni and other community supports (e.g., faith-based institutions ). Community boards. Private foundations for matching funds. S tep 5: Create and formally present a concept p a\u00ad per. A strong grant -writing team or consultant creates the concept paper. Critical issues toaddress include: A clearly articulated problem statement,proposed plan, implementation process,timeline, and evaluation process. Describe the problem using a combination of stati s\u00ad tics and short personal stories. How the resources you are seeking fit yourorganization's mission/strategic plan. The roles to be played by your partners. If you are seeking private funding, a planfor transitioning to public funding. S tep 6: Conduct p ostpresentation activities. Homelessness is a politically charged issue;handle contacts with funders with tact. S tep 7: Receive funding . Designing and funding your initiative ends; implementation begins. Adapting clinical services to meet the needs of the target population At this stage, you and the clinical staff learn to adapt clinical practices to meet the needs ofclients and influence institutional policy. F o\u00ad cusing on individual cases of homelessness makes it easier to understand the context of counselor -client work and the barriers to d o\u00ad ing the work. For example, counselors in a d e\u00adtoxification program (in the same organizationas an intensive substance abuse treatment pr o\u00ad gram) request case -by-case exc eptions for people who are homeless to a policy barringreadmission of clients within 30 days of di s\u00ad charge. In each case, the counselors argue thatthe policy is a barrier to rapid readmission tosubstance abuse treatment, which would r e\u00ad duce the relapse severity and the length oftreatment needed by the client. As the cases brought to the administrator accumulate, he orshe eventually changes the policy. As project scale increases and clients engage, you will identify other components of care: Frontline s taff note good collaborative ex\u00ad periences with some NGOs, whereas oth\u00ad ers do not meet the expected clinical standards when working with people inintensive substance abuse treatment who are homeless. Referrals are withheld from the latter, which may stimulate develo p\u00ad ment of more flexible services in the co m\u00ad munity and a corresponding increase inreferrals. Counselors, case managers, andsupervisors realize the need for service andpolicy modifications to better meet the population's needs. For example, after o b\u00ad serving that some people feel isolatedwhen placed in their own apartments, cr e\u00ad ate an alumni program to facilitate co n\u00ad nection to community recovery supports and help people successfully transition topermanent housing. Documentation and use of surveys andfeedback loops become more sophisticatedand formalized to enable sharing of info r\u00ad mation with funding sources and State a u\u00ad thorities. As clinical and administrative leaders fo r\u00ad malize the integration of people who are homeless into the organization and thetreatment system, their bottom- up efforts lead, directly or indirectly, to top -down i n\u00ad tegration opportunities. 159 160 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Top-Down Service Modification Top-down service modifications work when you are familiar with the target population and can assess and overcome the barriers to care. You can develop service modifications throughnegotiations with other providers within andacross service systems. Such strategies are i n\u00ad formed by bottom -up processes, such as sol v\u00ad ing dilemmas that arise in frontline work. How do you perform top-down services modification? Step 1: A llocate money . A request for proposals is issued or a service need is identified. St ep 2: Identify stakeholders/collaborators. Identify stakeholders\u2014representatives of local governments, businesses, employers, recovery communities, and other service providers who will want to refer clients to your program. Identify partners \u2014outreach teams, hous\u00ad ing providers, mental health treatment providers, vocational and recovery serviceproviders , financial and health be nefit pr o\u00ad viders, and primary healthcare providers who want to develop new capacities in ex\u00adisting programs or create new interagency programs. Identify the scope of the project and the role of each partner. Get letters of support from partners, rec\u00adognized advocacy groups, and other stak e\u00ad holders. St ep 3: Find local or regional resources to help you develop the program. Bring in resources as needed to help you define the services you wish to provide, the adaptations your programwill need to make, and a timef rame for i m\u00ad plementing services. S tep 4: Write a proposal or concept paper. Include a budget; bring all collaborators to the table. S tep 5: Implement the plan once a contract is awarded . Hold an upper -level adviso ry and imple\u00ad mentation meeting : - Administrators in the par t\u00ad nership (interorganizational) or pr o\u00ad grams (intraorganizational) meet andidentify what needs to be done, whatneeds further investigation, and whowill be responsible for doing so. - A memorandum of understanding(MOU) or memorandum of agreement(MOA) between the NGOs (intero r\u00ad ganizational only) is drafted and d e\u00ad scribes tasks and roles. (A sample MOU appears in Part 2, Chapter 2.) Assemble an implementation team: - During the startup period, program d i\u00ad rectors work together to coordinate services. - The team identifies other committees (e.g., screening, case management) andpersons (e.g., consumers, senior clinical staff members, line counseling staff members, peer counselors, program evaluator s) to be involved in adminis\u00ad tering t he project. - The team addresses confidentiality agreements, admission criteria, and i n\u00ad take forms. Form a team of service providers ; define their roles. Staff members from collabora t\u00ad ing programs create a core team to provideservices and cross -train and educate each other about their programs, organizations,and roles. Potential members include: - Peer counselors. - Outreach workers. - Case managers. - Substance abuse and mental health treatment counselors. - Team leader(s) who collaborate withpeers in other NGOs, provide some clinical services and supervision, andare trained to work with people who 160 Part 2, Chapter 1 have been diagnosed with co-occurring disorders ( CODs ). - Consultants on medical and mental health needs of individuals who are homeless who facilitate petitions forinvoluntary transport and hospitaliz a\u00ad tion when necessary. - Liaisons to detoxification services,criminal justice, and financial andhealth benefits. St ep 6: Schedule regular interorganizational meetings. Address policies and procedures that inhibit service provision to people who are homeless. Regular working groups can i n\u00ad clude: Advisory board. Upper -level managers from each collaborating organization orthe head administrators from each organ i\u00ad zation to be involved in proposal creation,addressing outcome me asures, data, r e\u00ad ports for the funder, and the like. Client selection committee. Midlevel cli directors from each organiz a\u00ad tion. Interorganization/interdisciplinary clinicalcase management team. Direct service staff meet weekly to discuss new a dmis\u00ad sions, people in transition, and particularly challenging cases. Stakehold er advisory group. Keeps co m\u00ad munity stakeholders aboard as program starts. Example of successful service modification: Health Care for the Homeless In practice, programming chang es often co m\u00ad bine bottom -up and top -down strategies. Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) in Ba l\u00ad timore, MD, provides an excellent example of this combination, which results in comprehen\u00adsive services provided when the client is ready. Bottom-up service modification Begun in 1985 as a small triage and outreach unit, HCH is now accredited by the JointCommission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. By adding pr o\u00ad grams as needs were identified, HCH now offers a broad range of services: street ou t\u00ad reach, primary health care, mental health ser\u00ad vices, intensive outpatient substance abuse treatment, medication -assisted treatment, and referrals to residential treatment. A bottom -up modification resulted from an analysis of i n\u00ad takes that revealed that people purchased b u\u00ad prenorphine on the street when they could notaccess detoxification services. This suggested aneed for a buprenorphine initiative to improveengagement and treatment retention. Fundingfor a nurse and case manager was sought andwon, but for only one position. A nurse/case manager was hired for a caseload of five clients daily. When he left, a substance abuse case manager was hired and an agreement was cr e\u00ad ated with the health center staff to administer and store the medications. Top-down service modification A top -down modification was prompted by requirements from funding sources that influ\u00adenced the length of service delivery and pr o\u00ad gram development. Separate funding streams for mental health (mostly third -party billing systems) and substance abuse treatment ser\u00advices (mostly public funding and grants) crea t\u00ad ed differences in approaches to service delivery. Federal requirements for more formal data and reporting mechanisms led to State service outcome benchmarks for the substance abuse treatment pro gram that focused heavily on abstinence, program use, and retention. Tomeet these benchmarks and the engagementneeds of people who are homeless, HCH cr e\u00ad ated a pretreatment phase supported by the City of Baltimore. People in precontemplationfor substance abuse treatment receive readiness 161 162 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless counseling focused on health education that engages them in treatment at their own pace. Interacting With Community Resources To Build a Continuum of Care HUD defines a continuum of care as a local planning process involving the range and d i\u00ad versity of stakeholders in a community in as\u00ad sessing and planning for the needs of people who are homeless. Normally, one superagency is designated as the coordinator of the conti n\u00ad uum of care planning process, and one appli\u00adcation i s made on behalf of the community for HUD funding. \" Community\" is defined by the continuum of care planning process as the g e\u00ad ographic area included in the application. Theapplication is based on assessed needs forthree types of housing in the community:emergency shelter, transitional housing, andpermanent housing , along with the supportive services needed to address each of these hous\u00ading needs. One of the features that makes the continuum of care process unique is that itmay include nonprofit agencies, governmental agencies, community -based organizations, agencies in the community that provide sup\u00adportive services (such as mental health andsubstance abuse treatment programs), local businesses, law enforcement, and consumers who are homeless or were form erly homeless. Rarely is one program able to meet all of the client's needs, as the continuum of care i m\u00ad plies. As a result, collaboration among pr o\u00ad grams is essential. Although your program 's counselors may interact with other agencies atthe level of the i ndividual client through ou t\u00ad reach, treatment planning, case management,treatment, and follow -up, administrators must work to develop collaborative continua of care,overcome interagency barriers, and ensure thatthere is \"no wrong door\" through which to en\u00adt er services. This is particularly true when a d\u00ad dressing the needs of clients who have two ormore urgent , severe problems \u2014homelessness and substance abuse or mental illness. Like\u00adwise, although a homelessness program may employ behavioral health counselors, they areseldom equipped or funded to provide the full complement of services necessary for compr e\u00ad hensive substance abuse and mental health treatment. An integrated system of care that provides a continuum of housing services increases co m\u00ad munication among the organizations involved,improves coordination among providers, andserves more people who are homeless. Exam\u00ad ples of the interrelationship of a continuum ofcare, supportingprogram development and service modific a\u00ad tion, a nd strategies for effective service deli v\u00ad ery appear later in this chapter. Exhibit 2 -3 highlights the benefits of an integrated system of services for people who are homeless. Collaborative Partnerships In interacting with other community resources and bec oming part of your community's co n\u00ad tinuum of care, you can establish collaborative partnerships with other agencies that serve substance abuse and mental health clients who are homeless. These partnerships can helpyour organization expand its range of serv ices, link up with other systems, and foster innov a\u00ad tive programming, funding, and community acceptance ( Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [ SAMHSA] , 2006). Successful collaboration requires negotiation, compromise, and commitment to address a problem about which all stakeholders exper i\u00ad ence a sense of urgency and responsibility. An early step in forming partnership s is sharing different perspectives on the problem (e.g.,lack of treatment resources versus lack of 162 Part 2, Chapter 1 Exhibit 2 -3: Integrated System of Homelessness Services Components Description Goals Continuum of Care A plan and infrastructure of forma l\u00ad ized operations and coordinated services provided by multiple o r\u00ad ganizations.

So urce: Leginski, 2007. Adapted with permission. appropriate housing stock) and establishing guiding principles or assumptions for the co l\u00ad laboration. Failure to resolve different perspec\u00ad tives can cause covert power struggles. Otherbarriers to overcome when pursuing partner\u00adships include: Competition for scarce resources amo ng community organizations. Unwritten policies of daily service delivery. Service organizations that resist change. Creating Interorganizational Partnerships To address system and service delivery pro b\u00ad lems with people who are homeless, assess the problem and gather information about the target population and the strategies needed toresolve the problem. Interorganizational needs assessment To assess the needs of an interorganizational continuum of care, determine the size and characteristics of the population that is hom e\u00ad less and assess issues raised by community members, governmental agencies, and service providers. One way to start is by talking withother service providers who work with people who are homeless and working with the o r\u00ad ganization that will apply or has applied forHUD funds. In some localities, a single orga n\u00ad ization or agency represents the community's needs. The information contained in the \" Conti nuum of Care\" application often pr o\u00ad vides a thorough review of strengths and gaps in the community's services. 163 164 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Intraorganization assessment To assess your organization's ability to assist people who are homeless, analyze the numberand characteristics of p eople seeking services who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Start by counting the number of people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness who are admitted to substance abuse or mental health treatment during a 2 -to 4-week period. Other measures include the number of people admitted with criminal justice involvementand the number discharged without emplo y\u00ad ment, job training, or stable housing. This type of assessment includes staff discussion of fin d\u00ad ings at team meetings to better understandhow organizational factors influence findings . Steps in the assessment process Determine the population's gender, et h\u00ad nic, and racial makeup; criminal justice e x\u00ad status; language; andnature of homelessness (i.e., situational,episodic, chron ic). Determine whether these characteristics are reflected in the staff providing services. Identify gaps in the continuum: - Are people not staying in treatment? - Are some counselors seeing 1 clientwho is homeless per month while ot h\u00ad ers see 10? - Are clients referred from other services in a coordinated fashion, or are theywalking in without referrals? - Are clients transitioning out of sub\u00adstance abuse or mental health treatment without employment and housing? - Do clients have a primary care provid\u00ad er and affo rdable access to needed medication? - Are some programs in the organizationdeclining referrals because the clients are homeless? - Do some programs in the organizationhave particular difficulty working withclients who have either substance use disorders or mental illnesses? Identify policies and procedures contri b\u00ad uting to service gaps and consider how tochange them; use a formal continuous quality improvement methodology. See the Network for the Improvement of A d\u00ad diction Treatment's Primer on Process Im\u00adprove ment (2008). The Addiction Technology Transfer Center Network (2004a,b) also offers useful publications on the topic . Identify issues in the community, such as: - More people living on the streets. - Legislation that handles homelessness through arrest rather than social ser\u00ad vices. - Insufficient affordable housing stock. - Insufficient mental health, substance abuse, and medical treatment services. Determine whether this is an opportunity to partner with other providers to improveaccess to services, create resources to meetthe needs of people who are homeless, andreduce costs to the community: - If services to address these issues are compatible with your organizationalmission and strategic plan, then deve l\u00ad op programming. - If these services aren' t part of your str a\u00ad tegic plan or mission, look for commu\u00ad nity partner s. - If other providers can't offer needed services, consider developing them in your agency . Exhibits 2 -4 and 2 -5 provide information on forming and documenting partnerships . 164 Exhibit 2 -4: How T o Develop Partnerships 1. Identify organizations in your community affected by homelessness and NGOs and government entities that already provide services or interact i n the community with people who are homeless. 2. Reach o ut to and become familiar with potential partners (e.g., police, emergency services, bus i\u00ad nesses, elected officials, neighborhood organizations, health centers); the key to partnerships is finding a shared objective. 3. Agree on a definition of the problem; assess your readiness to partner with them and theirs with you. 4. Form a partnership that benefits both organizations. 5. Define the benefits for each partner. 6. Identify the contributions each organization must make in order to realize these benefits. 7. Sustain partnerships by negotiating agreements that capture the basis of the partnership and the active linkages between partners that allow monitoring of both challenges and successes. So urce: SAMHSA, 2006. Adapte d from material in the public domain. Exhibit 2 -5: How T o Document Partnerships A memorandum of agreement is a written agreement between parties (e.g., NGOs, Federal or State governments, communities, and/or individuals) to work together on a project or meet an objective. An MOA outlines the responsibilities and benefits of each partner. It can be a partnership agreement or a legally binding document that holds parties responsible to their commitment. A memorandum of understanding is less formal than an MOA. Many NGOs and government agencies use MOUs to define relationships between departments or NGOs and to ensure smooth operations of shared resources and service provision. MOUs can address intraorganizational connectivity, com\u00ad munications, escalations, and response patterns. See Part 2, Chapter 2, for a sample MOU. Part 2, Chapter 1 Example of Successful Partnership: Downtown Emergency Service Cente r In Seattle, WA, the Downtown Emergency Service Center (DESC) has used partnerships to improve housing services, integrate trea t\u00ad ment services, access other community r e\u00ad sources, and create innovative housingprogramming (SAMHSA, 2006). Internally, DESC integrated its shelter, clinical services, and housing programs. Staff members from each clinical program (i.e., outreach andengagement case managers, substance abuse treatment counselors, and crisis respite pr o\u00ad gram workers) are co -located in the shelter. DESC provides intensive support for housingstability by having o ne project manager super\u00ad vise the staff responsible for supportive hous\u00ading property management an d the sta ff re\u00ad sponsible for supportive services. DESC uses information technology to make informationabout people receiving services available tostaff members in different programs. In daily meetings, outreach and engagement, housing, and clinical services staff members discuss n ew clients and emerging client problems. DESC partners externally with community services and political organizations. Comm u\u00ad nity partners include the Seattle Departmentof Social and Health Services, the police d e\u00ad partment, mental health a nd drug courts, and the local emergency center. Political partners include the county executive, mayor, anddowntown association president. To increase access to benefits for people who can't tolerate the regular process, the staff represent s them and work s directly with benefit managers, 165 166 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless resulting in more successful benefit applic a\u00ad tions. A mutually beneficial collaboration with the police includes offering a standardizedprogram for police trainees to work alongside service providers, making shelter space availa\u00adble as an alternative to incarceration, assistingwith safety issues, and meeting regularly toaddress issues. DESC provides case management, substance abuse treatment, and mental health and em\u00adployment services to people referred by the drug court. Shelter staff communicate daily with the ER to increase the shelter's access to emergency medical care. DESC obtains don a\u00ad tions from businesses by showing that the housing program decreases the use of emer\u00adgency services, jail, court, and detoxification,and saves the community money while provi d\u00ad ing more humane, respectful services for peo\u00adple who are homeless. DESC maintains astrong relationship with political partners by showing that programs effectively meet the needs of people who are homeless and by a d\u00ad vocating for policies that facilitate innovative programming, funding, and support. DESC's relationship with political partners supportedthe creation of an innovative housing andtreatment program in Seattle. Internet Resources Becoming informed about housing programs is one way you can help your program create relationships with other community agencies serving people who are homeless. A great deal of information is available on the Internet from the following Web sites: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development: http://www.hud.gov National Alliance to End Homelessness: http://www.naeh.org Corporation for Supportive Housing:http://www.csh.org SAMHSA's National Registry ofEvidence -Based Programs and Practices: http://nrepp.samhsa.gov National Health Care for the Homeless Council: http://www.nhchc.org U.S. Depart ment of Health and Human Services (HHS) Health Resources andServices Administration Information Center: http://www.hrsa.gov U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)Web site on reaching out to veterans whoare homeless: http://www1.va.gov/homeless VA Web site on health benefits eligibility for veterans: http://www.va.gov/healtheligibility National Resource Center on Homelessness and Mental Illness: http://www.nrchmi.samhsa.gov Integrating Behavioral Health Services With a Community System of Homelessness Services Across the continuum of rehabilitation ser\u00ad vices for people who are homeless, a variety ofcommunity care providers may be engagedwith the client. Some of these services include mental health and substance abuse treatment,housing and rehabilitation services specifically for people who are homeless, general health \u00ad care p rograms, and other community social and rehabilitation services. Your program maybe a small part of the larger services contin u\u00ad um, or may be a major provider of care thatspans several of these domains. In either case,it is important that programs have a common goal of quality care for people experiencinghomelessness, a recognition that homelessness in the community cannot be addressed by simply providing shelter, and a commitment toand a strategic plan for the coordination andnonduplication of service s. 166 Part 2, Chapter 1 Additionally , there are distinct phases of care for persons who are homeless and are affected by substance abuse or mental illness. These are described in Part 1, Chapter 1, and include engagement, intensive care, and ongoing reh a\u00ad bilitation (McQuistion, Felix, & Samuels, 2008). Two additional transition phases (fromengagement to intensive care and intensive care to ongoing rehabilitation) are critical times during which clients may regress from their homelessness rehabilitation, experience arelapse to their substance use or psychiatricsymptoms, or drop out of treatment ; these phases are therefore important to consider in your community programming. In a few communities, the entire continuum of care might be offered by one comprehensive program, but it is more likely that different organizations work at different points on thecontinuum. Be aware of services provided in your community, the scope of the services inan individual agency, and the extent to which outreach and treatment services for behavior al health are provided. This will allow you toidentify gaps in services and develop programs to address them. The phases of rehabilitation form a frameworkthat can guide your decisionmaking aboutprogram development, implementation, ma n\u00ad agement, and evaluation. The outline below lists the ways your agency can prepare for andparticipate in providing services to clients whoare in each phase of rehabilitation from hom e\u00ad lessness. Outreach and Engagement In this first phase of rehabilitation, counselor s begin to build and leverage relationship s to offer the kinds of help needed by people withsubstanc e use and mental disorders who face homelessness. As an administrator, you can: Establish collaborative relationships withcommunity organizations. Form interdi sciplinary teams from several organizations that are coordinated through a single entity. Teams can provide direct access to services that meet client needs and help clients transition from this phase into intensive care. Outreach services that respond to community stakeholders' needs include taking hotline calls from individ u\u00ad als and neigh borhood and civic association representatives , in addition to forging strong relationships with local police pr e\u00ad cincts and ERs. Schedule staff members to be off site and available to potential clients. Ensure that your staff ha s the training and experience to perform outreach and e n\u00ad gagement and to work with individuals and families experiencing crises related tohomelessness. This also entails beingaware of community resources for emer\u00adgency and temporary housing, their r e\u00ad strictions and limitations on services, and their admission requirements. Provide funding for practical goods and resources that can be offered to prospective clients (e.g., specific needs of children wholive in families who are homeless, batteredand abused women and children, people who live on the street). Develop tools to document outreach co n\u00ad tacts. (See Part 2, Chapter 2, for a sa mple Homelessness Outreach Contact F orm and a sample Daily Contact Log .) Provide training for staff members to pr e\u00ad pare them for the realities of outreachwork (e.g., working outside the office set\u00adting; working with individuals and familieswho are experiencing immediate crises;working with people who want resources but resist or only passively comply withtreatment services; tolerating clients whoare inconsistent in their contacts and ap\u00adpear one day, then disappear for several days). 167 168 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Ensure that your staff is trained in the ap\u00ad propriate interventions for this phase of homeless rehabilitation (such as rapportbuilding) and that staff members are able to rapidly develop case management plans for services. Ensure that staff members can recognize signs that a potential client is ready tomake a transition to the intensive care phase of homeless rehabilitation or the contemplation stage of change for sub\u00adstance abuse or mental health treatment. Provide supervision for outreach workers. Provide a for um for discussion of policies and procedures related to conduct and safety on the street and in shelters; forma l\u00ad ize policies and procedures (see Part 2, Chapter 2, for samples). Policies should require that staff members work in pairs, carry cell phones, a nd be able to contact a supervisor when needed. Policies and pr o\u00ad cedures should require teams to leave sit u\u00ad ations in which any one member feels unsafe and to choose next steps together. Plan and structure critical incident de\u00adbriefings. Discuss steps necessary for quality assur\u00adance. Transition to Intensive Care This phase begins when the client agrees toaccept case management, entitlements, hous\u00ading, treatment, health care, or other services \u2014 or when there is a need for acute medical or mental health treatmen t. As an administrator, you can: Formalize policies and procedures forrecordkeeping for potential clients enter\u00ading the system. Provide for delivery of tangible benefits,such as food, clothing, and transportation. Enlist help from emergency shelters forpretreatment beds to house clients while they wait for treatment slots. Assign case management specialists toprovide flexible services, such as housing negotiation , completi on of financial and/or health benefit applications, and as\u00ad sistance with using public transportation. Provide intensive case management (ICM)and critical time intervention (time \u00ad limited ICM) to potential clients as a p\u00ad propriate. These strategies help the agency keep track of clients, help clients stay co n\u00ad nected to the agency, and provide access toa variety of services and agencies. Offer attractive support services for clients , such as employment, financial and healthbenefits, and medical and mental healthservices. Offer peer -led services to encourage en\u00ad gagement in services and enhance empo w\u00ad erment and confidence. Coordinate transition planning with local agencies, such as jails, hospitals, and su b\u00ad stance abuse and mental health treatment programs , to provide housing resources for clients being discharged or released. Develop protocols for transition planning. Offer transportation to housing for clients exiting jails, hospitals, or treatment pr o\u00ad grams. Ensure that your staff is familiar with your community's housing resources, their r e\u00ad quirements, and their limitations. Intensive Care Intensive care begins when a person engages in a clinic, shelter, outpatient, or r esidential treatment program, accepts ACT team ser\u00ad vices, or obtains transitional or permanent support ive housing (McQuistion et al., 2008). Treatment of substance use and mental diso r\u00ad ders and medical conditions is the primary focus during this phase . Yo u c a n: Develop MOAs and MOUs with collab o\u00ad rating housing resources in the community (e.g., programs providing transitional and 168 Part 2, Chapter 1 permanent supportive housing) so clients do not fal l through the cracks in trans i\u00ad tioning between or working with two di f\u00ad ferent community systems (housing andbehavioral health). Provide thorough screening and asses s\u00ad ment by behavioral health professionals that includes assessment of substance use and mental health as well as housing needs, financial status, employment status,and other areas of life functioning. Fully accomplish active introduction toongoing and nonemergent general healthand wellness services, whether off site with active case management o r on site through implementing models of behavioral healthand primary care integration. Increase engagement and retention by r e\u00ad ducing or eliminating waiting time; usingpeer facilitators, mentors, and senior pr o\u00ad gram participants to orient people to ser\u00advices right after they are assigned to a treatment program; and providing educa\u00adtional sessions for the client's family as a p\u00ad propriate. Provide peer mentoring to strengthenconnections to recovery supports. Develop methods to improve compliance with treatment of substance use, mental illness, and medical disorders and cond i\u00ad tions. Address , through your programming , the needs of parents with children. Provide services or care for children in your agency or by referral. Offer treatment with afamily focus. Assess the safety of children who do not accompany their parents totreatment. Ensure that the services you provide are trauma informed. Offer anger manag e\u00ad ment and assertiveness training. Provide training to staff in nonconfrontationalmethods of addressing conflict and in strengths -based approaches. Offer gender - specific treatment groups (see the planned TIP, Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Servic es [SAMHSA, planned h ]). Be familiar with behavioral health trea t\u00ad ment models for people who are homeless and how your community uses those models. Behavioral health treatment models for people who are homeless You should be familiar with rehabilitation models for people who are homeless. Y our agency may want to partner with other age n\u00ad cies in your community; your staff members may want to be involved with clients from other programs. This section describes three approaches. Assertive community treatment was first used for people with serious mental illness (SMI) at high risk of institutionaliz a\u00ad tion and modified for people who are home\u00adless. HCH is a model program designed to engage people who are homeless into housing,services, and substance abuse recovery. Modi\u00ad fied therapeutic communities (MTCs) com\u00ad bine housing and treatment program models. ACT teams SAMHSA has designated this evidence -based practice as appropriate for clients who have extensive histories of psychiatric hospitaliz a\u00ad tion, are homeless, have co -occurring su b\u00ad stance abuse or medical problems, and/or are involved in the criminal justice system. ACTservices are sometimes used in Housing Firstprograms, but ACT teams also function ind e\u00ad pendently of housing programs and are oftenpart of a behavioral health organization. A team -based approach is used to offer s ub\u00ad stance abuse and mental health treatment,housing, healthcare, medication, and emplo y\u00ad ment services; help with family relations; and recreational opportunities. People can refuse formal treatment without losing housing. Eventhen, the team visits at least weekly to assess the person's safety, well -being, and living cond i\u00ad tions and to keep communication channels 169 170 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless open between the client and the team. On vi s\u00ad its, the team notes the person's mental and physical state, follows up on outstanding issues from the last visit, and offers help with wha t\u00ad ever the individual wishes to address. The team often helps with routine chores and co n\u00ad veys to the individual that he or she matters tothe team (Hackman & Dixo n, 2006). Health Care for the Homeless HCH combines comprehensive services in a manner that is appealing to people who are homeless. Substance abuse treatment intake, assessment, and engagement occur on a flexible walk-in basis to accommodate clients' di fficulty with keeping appointments. Participants who meet the criteria for outpatient or intensive outpatient treatment are encouraged to engage in treatment at HCH. Those needing inp a\u00ad tient medical care, methadone maintenance, orresidential treatment are referred to other pr o\u00ad grams. People too ill to navigate the sheltersystem are provided shelter and nursing ser\u00advices in a convalescent care program. Counselors assess for substance use, symptoms of mental illness, housing, criminal justice sys\u00adtem involvement, social supports, job interests,work history, and goals, then reframe this i n\u00ad formation to reflect client strengths and i n\u00ad crease motivation to complete treatment andpursue stable employment when possible.Each counselor sees 15 to 20 clients. Each caseload is a mixture of people in various sta g\u00ad es of treatment preparedness. Clients receive individual counseling once a week or as oftenas determined by their recovery plans, includ\u00ading walk -in sessions. The group counseling progr am is based on the stages of change. Modified therapeutic communities MTCs are specialized residential settings staffed by workers who are trained to address both mental and substance use disorders. This model includes a supportive housing comp o\u00ad nent in continuing care. Following the client's decision to accept MTC services, a structured daily regimen is gradually introduced. Services emphasize personal r e\u00ad sponsibility and mutual support in addressinglife difficulties, peers as role models andguides, and the peer community as the healing agent. Staff and clients create action plans tomonitor short -term goals. These goals build as success accumulates, adapt to reflect relapses and return of symptoms of mental illness, andreflect the unique needs and readiness forchange of the individual. At program entry, clients join a housing preparation group and receive other initial ser\u00ad vices. Staff members build trust, increase mo\u00ad tivation, and provide education onhomelessness, mental illness, and substance abuse through multiple contacts and a weekly orientation group. The group also strengthens peer affiliations and provides information onprogram structure and activities. MTCs operate on token economies. Points are won for behaviors , such as medication compl i\u00ad ance, abstinence, attendance at program activ i\u00ad ties, follow -through on referrals, completed assignments, and activities of daily living.Negative behaviors result in loss of points.Points can be exchanged for phone cards, to i\u00ad letries, and so forth. Peer facili tators act as role models to encourage the involvement of peo\u00adple who are newly admitted, build hope, andplan for the future. Teaching vocational and independent living skills is a key part of an MTC program. Voc a\u00ad tional activities begin shortly after entry , and work experience begins in a peer work group.Vocational exploration and work readiness as\u00adsessments detail client work history, interests,attitudes, and ability to find a job (e.g., applic a\u00ad tions, interviewing, interpersonal relationships). 170 Part 2, Chapter 1 Basic vocational skills training in maintenance, clerical, and inventory tasks are taught, withweekly job assignments and peer group review. Interested individuals who show commitment to the program, personal progress, and ability to help others are recruited into peer counselortraining near the end of residential treatment.They get didactic and practical experience as role models, group facilitators, and counselorsand attend briefing and debriefing sessionsbefore and after each group and activity. Thesupervisor or program director provides supe r\u00ad vision each week and a written evaluation each month, and other staff members, assisted by senior trainees, run weekly peer counselortraining groups . Trainees are paid a stipend. Those who successfully complete both peer counselor training and the MTC residential program can become counselors in the MTC or comparable programs. Transition to Ongoing Rehabilitation This transition is gradual and is a high -risk time for dropout and/or relapse. Much of the programming that behavioral health programscan undertake at this phase relates to buildingrecovery skills, reducing relapse risks, and en\u00ad couraging participants to increase their i n\u00ad volvement in the community through 12 -Step programs and other community support ef\u00ad forts. Transitional housing for individuals lea v\u00ad ing intensive behavioral health treatment, as described in Part 1, Chapter 1 , may become a primary support for the transition to ongoingrehabilitation. Halfway and \u00be -way houses for individuals graduating from intensive beha v\u00ad ioral health treatment and Oxford Houses for people recovering from substance use disorders are examples of housing resources that canbenefit individuals making the transition to ongoing homelessness rehabilitation. To make your program most effective at this stage, you can: Facilitate staff efforts to plan for discharge from substance abuse or mental health treatment for clients facing homelessness. Plan for clients' ongoing medical and r e\u00ad habilitation needs, including continuing care, relapse prevention training, support services, transportation, and other recoverysupports (see the planned TIP, Recovery in Behavioral Health Services [ SAMHSA, planned e ]). Include ICM and other evidence -based practices that support recovery. Maintain agency c ontacts with the hou s\u00ad ing network, particularly transitional sup\u00adportive and permanent supportive housing . Facilitate connections in the community that could provide opportunities for clients to obtain paid or volunteer work. Ongoing Rehabilitation In this o pen-ended stage, the client self - identifies as no longer homeless, sustains andfurther incorporates changes made in intensive care, and works to avoid relapse (McQuistionet al., 2008). Administrators can: Support staff members as they continue to devote time to clients in ongoing rehabil i\u00ad tation and abstinenc e (e.g., by helping cli\u00ad ents establish roles in the community ). Provide a means for clients to contact the agency in case of a relapse to substance use, a return of symptoms of mental il l\u00ad ness, or a cri sis in housing. Provide ongoing support for clients , in\u00ad cluding regular follow- up meetings or phone calls. Service approaches \u2014model programs Permanent supportive housing Permanent supportive housing for persons with psychiatric disabilities offers individua ls who are homeless, at risk of homelessness, orprecariously housed an opportunity to obtain 171 172 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless and maintain a residence in the community. The residence can be a single -occupancy house or apartment (scattered -site housing) or single- site housing, in which residents share apartments in a single building or cluster ofbuildings. Permanent supportive housing o f\u00ad fers people the opportunity to be integratedwithin the larger community, to have a homeof their own, and to have choice in where andhow they live. SAMHSA 's Permanent Supportive Housing Evidence- Based Practices (EBP) KIT (2010) lists 12 elements of permanent supportive housing programs that form the core guiding principles of these programs and differentiate them from other forms of housing assistance.The 12 elements are: 1. Tenants have a lease in their name; thus, they have full rights of tenancy underlandlord-tenant law, including control over living space and protection against evic\u00adtion. 2. Leases do not have any provisions thatwould not be found in leases held by someone who does not have a psychiatricdisability. 3. Participation in services is voluntary , and tenants cannot be evicted for rejecting ser\u00advices. 4. House rules, if any, are similar to those found in housing for people without psy\u00ad chiatric disabilities and do not restrict vis i\u00ad tors or otherwise interfere with life in the community. 5. Housing is not time limited, and the lease is renewable at the tenant's and owner's option. 6. Before moving into permanent supportive housing, tenants are asked about theirhousing preferences and are offered the same range of choices as are available toothers at their income level in the same housing market. 7. Housing is affordable ; tenants pay no more than 30 percent of their income t o\u00ad ward rent and utilities, with the balan ce available for discretionary spending. 8. Housing is integrated. Tenants have the opportunity to interact with neighborswho do not have psychiatric disabilities. 9. Tenants have choices in the support ser\u00advices they receive. 10. As needs change over time, tenants can receive more intensive or less intensive support services without losing theirhomes. 11. Support services promote recovery and are designed to help tenants choose, get, andkeep housing. 12. The provision of housing and the prov i\u00ad sion of support services are distinct. The ultimate goal of permanent supportive housing is to reduce discrimination and social stigma experienced by people with psychiatricdisabilities; to offer choice in housing and de \u00ad emphasize institutional and custodial care,which invites withd rawal from family and the community; and, especially, to reduce relapse leading to the need for specialized intensive mental health treatment . Several types of rental assistance can be provided throughpermanent supportive housing, including: Project -based rental assistance : Housing subsidies are tied to a specific housing unit. Sponsor -based rental assistance: The te n\u00ad ant leases a unit owned by a nonprofit group that rents to people qualified for the program. Tenant -based rental assistance: Qualified tenant s receive a voucher that can be a p\u00ad plied to rent in a housing unit that agrees to accept the voucher for part of the rent. Oxford Houses The Oxford House movement began in 1975in Silver Spring, MD, with the establishment 172 Part 2, Chapter 1 of a house, in a residential neighb orhood, for persons in recovery from substance use diso r\u00ad ders. The houses are democratically run by the residents and are drug free. There are now more than 1,200 houses throughout the Uni t\u00ad ed States. Each house operates under the guidelines of the Oxford House World Coun\u00ad cil and is guided in its operation by the Oxford House Manual. Some houses are exclusively formen or for women; others accept both sexes. Afew houses operate exclusively for individuals with children who also reside in the house. Participat ion in 12 -Step and other community change resources is strongly encouraged . Though most residents stay less than 2 years, there is no fixed time for residence. Individuals can live in the house as long as they share inthe rent and share in the operation a nd maintenance of the house. For more info r\u00ad mation on Oxford Houses, see Part 1, Chapter 1, of this TIP or the organization's Web site (http://www.oxfordhouses.org ). Building Linkages Among Services Individuals facing homelessness deal with multiple stressors in their lives. In many co m\u00ad munities, services to address these stressors have historically been segregated, making itdifficult for the client to access and use them. The lack of access to primary healthcare ser\u00advices can be a major difficulty. In recent years,however, community health centers have b e\u00ad come an integral component of healthcare d e\u00ad livery for individuals and families affected by homelessness. Some community health pr o\u00ad grams provide only primary healthcare se r\u00ad vices, but others have expanded to outreach,behavioral health, health promotion, and otheractivities. Federally Qualified Health Centers The \"Federally Qualified Health Center\" (FQHC) designation is given by the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Se r\u00ad vices to nonprofit public or private clinics thatprovide care to medically underserved areas orpopulations. FQHCs provide a comprehensive range of primary healthcare, behavioral health , and supportive services to patients regardless of ability to pay. A key function of FQHCs is thus to provide care to people who are home\u00ad less in their communities. Th ese centers are supported in part by grants from the Community Health Center program. Some, in com munities that have high rates of homelessness, may receive Federal HCH Pr o\u00ad gram grants; in fact, some FQHCs are sup\u00adported solely by these grants. The HCH care delivery approach involves a multidisciplinary integration of street ou t\u00ad reach, primary care, ment al health and su b\u00ad stance abuse treatment, case management, andclient advocacy. Coordinated efforts betweenFQHCs and other community health service provider s and social service agencies character\u00ad ize this approach to serving homeless popula\u00adtions. According to the National Academy for State Health Policy, the ability of these coo r\u00ad dinated efforts to improve the quality and eff i\u00ad ciency of care is increasingly important, given the emphasis in healthcare reform legislationon consolidated, integrated care (Takach & Buxbaum, 2011). The National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC) offers technical assistance to all HCH health centers. For re\u00ad source materials relevant to the provision ofcare to people who are homeless, visit their Web site ( http://www.nachc.com/homeless \u00ad healthcare.cfm ). 173 174 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless It is critical that behavioral health programs providing services to people who are homeless coordinate their services with community healthcare and other primar y healthcare pr o\u00ad viders. Clients facing homelessness may enterthe system through a variety of doors, and the locus of care may depend in part on primary symptoms exhibited by the client. An int e\u00ad grated approach, however, remains essential to quality care. Clients may enter the system in primary healthcare settings, State psychiatric hospitals or jails, community substance abuse treatmentfacilities, or community mental health centers,but should have access to care for primary health, substance abuse , and mental health services regardless of entry point. Dependingon the symptom presentation, clients may have one predominant need at the point ofentry to the system. Symptom severity may define how services are provided , but the i m\u00ad portant element of integrati on of care exists throughout the range of services available. Integrating Other Community Support Services Most individuals recovering from both hom e\u00ad lessness and a mental and/or substance use disorder need a variety of supportive services,especially in early recovery. Permanent housing is not sufficient to address the urgent needs they experience. The supportive resources pr o\u00ad vided by a variety of community agencies are essential. As opposed to the typical experience in institutional settings, clients in permanentsupportive housing always have a choice in which supportive services they will use. Add i\u00ad tionally, the services offered need to be tailoredto the unique needs of the individual client.Some people in recovery might need transpo r\u00ad tation, whereas others need case management services to orchestrate their path through amaze of social services. Still others may needfinancial management, including a designated payee to help handle their income and expen s\u00ad es; others may benefit from peer mentoring. Most will need a variety of supportive services.Contrary to their past experiences , individuals entering permanent supportive housing canchoose which services they will use. SAMHSA's Permanent Supportive Housing Evidence- Based Practices (EBP) KIT (2010) lists several domains of relevant services, i n\u00ad cluding: Services to support housing retention,such as helping clients understand t heir rights and obligations as renter s in the program, crisis intervention, using peermentoring and support groups, and devel\u00adoping recreational and socialization skills. Independent living skills, including co m\u00ad munication skills, conflict management skills, budgeting, personal hygiene, andhousekeeping. Recovery -focused services, such as partic i\u00ad pating in recovery support groups, beco m\u00ad ing an advocate for mental health and substance abuse recovery, and being a peermentor to new clients entering permanentsupportive housing. Community integration services designedto help the individual become part of the larger community and thereby develop a sense of belonging and connection to the neighborhood and the larger community through participation in communityevents, such as recreational activities, spi r\u00ad itual programs, community educational a c\u00ad tivities, and community events. Other service domai ns include involvement in traditional community support programs,which can include : Mental health services. Substance abuse treatment. Health and medical services. Vocational and employment services. Family services. 174 Funding Community Homelessness Services Various community, State, and national r e\u00ad sources provide funding for homelessness ser\u00ad vices. These funding sources may be private foundations, government entities , or comm u\u00ad nity groups. Only rarely can health insurance be a reliable funding source for homelessness services. Funding may be for \"bricks and mo r\u00ad tar,\" for provisions such as food or clothing, or for the targeting of sp ecific needs , such as su b\u00ad stance abuse treatment, mental health services,primary health care, or case management. One place to start with program development is tosurvey what resources for homelessness existin your community, what services those r e\u00ad sources provide, and who offers the fundingfor available services. Ideally, services shouldarise from identified commu nity needs (bottom -up planning); h owever, it is not u n\u00ad common that services arise from availa ble funding (top -down planning) or a combin a\u00ad tion of both. F ederal funding for homelessness services can be divided into two major categories: direct funding for housing and funding for services that support individuals who are homeless.The primary source of direct funding forhousing is HUD. In fiscal year 2011, $1.63 billion was available for Continuum of Care (CoC) grants. CoC programs are ba sed on community needs assessment and have a goal of helping individuals and families who are homeless quickly transition to self -sufficiency and permanent housing. In a CoC community,a local or regional planning board coordinatesfunding for housing and homelessness services for the geographic area. Local programs see k\u00ad ing funding apply jointly with other comm u\u00ad nity programs in a single application to HUD.The four primary components of CoC are: Outreach, intake, and assessment. Part 2, Chapter 1 Emergency shelter to provide immediate and safe alternatives for people who are homeless. Transitional housing with supportive ser\u00advices. Permanent supportive housing. The four primary programs available t o pro\u00ad vide these services are : Supportive Housing Program, now part ofthe Continuum of Care program. Shelter Plus Care Program, now part ofthe Continuum of Care program. Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation SingleRoom Occupancy Program . Dwellings for Homeless Individuals (Section 8/SRO) Program. Other HUD -sponsored housing programs include: Base Realignment and Closure. Housing Opportunities for Persons W ith AIDS Program. Veterans Affairs Supportive HousingProgram. Disaster Housing Assistance Program. Housi ng Choice Voucher Program (Sect ion 8). Public Housing Program. Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program. Section 811 Supportive Housing forPersons With Disabilities. Additionally, a variety of funding is availablefor supportive services for individuals andfamilies who are homeless or at risk of hom e\u00ad lessness. Some of these programs can also fundhousing services, but often only on a temp o\u00ad rary or transitional basis. In addition to HUD funding for services, programs from HHS, VA, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the U.S. Department of Labor contribute substantial funding to address homelessness. 175 176 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) is a SAMHSA - supported formula grant program to provide homelessness services for people with serious mental illness, including those with co - occurring substance use disorders. The pr o\u00ad gram provides funding to all 50 States and the U.S. Territories and possessions through a l\u00ad most 600 local agencies. Services include community -based outreach, mental health and substance abuse treatment, case managementand other support services, and limited hou s\u00ad ing options. Application for funding is madethrough each State's Single State Agency de s\u00ad ignated to manage PATH funding. The ser\u00advices provided in a particular State depend onthat State's need s. For instance, in rural areas, funding may be available for outreach in areaswhere homelessness services have not trad i\u00ad tionally been available. Some States have sup\u00adport programs for special populations withSMI. Other States coordinate services with local community mental health centers to e n\u00ad sure that individuals who are homeless or at risk of homelessness receive comprehensive care for mental illness or COD s. PATH mo n\u00ad ies are also available for training local provid\u00aders on effective strategies to assist people withSMI who are homeless. Other programs available through HHS for persons and families who are homeless i n\u00ad clude: Health Care for the Homeless. This mul\u00adtidisciplinary , comprehensive program provides primary health care, substance abuse treatment, emergency care wit h re\u00ad ferrals to hospitals for inpatient care se r\u00ad vices, and outreach services to helpdifficult -to-reach people who are homeless establish eligibility for entitlement pr o\u00ad grams and housing. Services in Supportive Housing (SSH) (SAMHSA). The SSH program helpsprevent and reduce chronic homelessness by funding services for individuals andfamilies experiencing chronic homeless\u00ad ness and living with a severe mental and/or substance use disorder. Grants are awar d\u00ad ed competitively for up to 5 years to co m\u00ad munity- based public or nonprofit entities. Services supported include, but are notlimited to, outreach and engagement, i n\u00ad tensive case management, mental healthand substance abuse treatment, and assi s\u00ad tance with obtaining benefits. Grant s for the Benefit of Homeless Ind i\u00ad viduals (GBHI) (SAMHSA). GBHI is a competitively awarded grant program thathelps communities expand and strengthen their treatment services for people exper i\u00ad encing homelessness. Grants are awardedfor up to 5 years to com munity- based pu b\u00ad lic or nonprofit entities. Funds may be used for substance abuse treatment, mental health services, wrap -around services, i m\u00ad mediate entry into treatment, outreachservices, screening and diagnostic services,staff training, case management, primary health services, job training, educational services, and relevant housing services. VA provides a variety of programs to assist veterans who are homeless. In cooperationwith HUD, VA provides permanent suppor t\u00ad ive housing and ongoing case managemen t services for veterans who require those sup\u00adports to live independently. HUD has also a l\u00ad located more than 20,000 Housing Choice Section 8 vouchers to Public Housing A u\u00ad thorities throughout the country for eligible veterans who are homeless. The HousingChoice Section 8 vouchers program is partic u\u00ad larly beneficial to female veterans, veterans recently returned from overseas, and veterans with disabilities . Housing is permanent and accompan ied by supportive services; the voucher is portable, allowing users to move todifferent locations or get better housing sol u\u00ad tions as they become available. 176 Part 2, Chapter 1 VA also funds community- based agencies to provide transitional housing and supportive services for veterans who are homeless through the Capital Grant Component pr o\u00ad gram. For m ore information on this program and the Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Programs, contact Jeff Quarles toll -free at 1-877-332-0334. Stand Down programs, located throughout the United States, are developed and operatedby veterans service organizations, local CoC programs, community groups, military per\u00adsonnel, and other interested citizens to provide shelter, meals, clothing, employment services,and medical care for veterans who are hom e\u00ad less. Normally, Stand Down programs are time limited (1 -3 days). VA funding is available for up to $10,000 to conduct events each year. The Interagency Council on Homelessness and the HEARTH Act The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) is an independent agency of the Federal executive branch and is composed of 19 Cabinet S ecretaries and age n\u00ad cy heads. Its mission is to coordinate the Fed\u00aderal response to homelessness and to work with State and local governments and the pr i\u00ad vate sec tor to end h omelessness in the N ation. The blueprint for this monumental task is provided in USICH's strategic plan, Opening Doors (http://www.usich.gov/opening_doors /). The plan calls for heightened dedication tosolving the problem, with an emphasis on i n\u00ad creasing economic security, improving healthand stability, and returning people experien c\u00ad ing homelessness to safe housing as soon as possible . The Council was established by the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assista nce Act of 1987 and was reauthorized by the Homeless Emergency Assistance and RapidTransition to Housing (HEARTH) Act of 2009, which amends the McKinney -Vento Act. Under the HEARTH Act, programs forhousing assistance were consolidated as fo l\u00ad lows: The Shelter Plus Care Program , Supportive Housing Program, and Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Single RoomOccupancy Program have been consolida t\u00ad ed into the Continuum of Care Program.The Act added 12 services to those eligible for funding: housing search mediation oroutreach to property owners; credit repair;provision of security or utility deposits;rental assistance for a final month at a l o\u00ad cation; assistance with moving costs;and/or other activities that help individuals who are homeless move immediately intohousing or would benefit individuals whohave moved into permanent housing in the past 6 months. The Emergency Shelter Grant program has been modified and renamed the Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) Pr o\u00ad gram. The ESG Program is meant to fundnot only traditional shelter and outreach activities, but also more prevention, rapidrehousing, and emergency shelter activ i\u00ad ties. Family support services for youth who are homeless, victim services, and mental health services now appear on the list ofeligible services that shelters or street ou t\u00ad reach teams can provide. Homelessness prevention activities are also expanded toinclude prevention and rehousing activ i\u00ad ties\u2014such as short -or medium- term housing assistance, housing relocation orstabilization services, housing searches, mediation or outreach to property owners,legal services, credit repair, security or uti l\u00ad ity deposits, utility payments, and assi s\u00ad tance with moving costs \u2014for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. 177 178 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless In addition, the HEARTH Act creates the \" Collaborative Applicant.\" This allows a single entity to submit one application for McKin\u00ad ney-Vento funds for all agencies in the co m\u00ad munity. Each geographic area has its own Collaborative Applicant, which is not neces\u00adsarily a legal entity. Cha nges in funding are likely to be made by future State and Federal legislation. Requir e\u00ad ments, eligibility, levels of funding, and types of favored programs can change, as can thecommunity agencies with whom you collab o\u00ad rate to provide services. A skillful administra\u00adtor is proactive, anticipating modifications in policies and opportunities covered by the new laws. Chapter 2 of this section introduces you to the types of policies and procedures that behavio r\u00ad al health agencies have found helpful in wor k\u00ad ing with clients who are homeless or at risk ofhomelessness. The intent is to provide admi n\u00ad istrators with a starting point for handling i s\u00ad sues of safety, transportation, medical emergencies, and the li ke, along with proc e\u00ad dures for tracking your staff 's contacts and a c\u00ad tions with clients. 178 IN THIS CHAPTER Introduction Organizational Approaches to Programming for Homelessness Services Sample Policies and Procedures Sample Forms Part 2, Chapter 2 Part 2, Chapter 2 Introduction This chapter provides program descriptions and sample policies, procedures, and forms that support development of programming to meet the needs of people who are homeless. All documents are meant to serve as starting points; you must adapt them to suit the philosophy and procedures of your organization. Our thanks to Deborah Fisk, LCSW, Director, Connecticut Men\u00ad tal Health Center Outreach and Engagement Project in New H a\u00ad ven, CT, and Douglas J. Warn, LCSW, Director, Project Renewal Chemical Dependence Outpatient Clinic in New York, NY, forproviding some of the materials in this section. Additionally, anumber of programs described below offered program descriptions illustrating different approaches to programming for homelessness. Organizational Approaches to Programming for Homelessness Services Homelessness services may be provided by a variety of community - based organizations: mental health clinics, substance abuse trea t\u00ad ment programs, developmental disability service agencies, organ i\u00ad zations specifically concerned with housing and homelessness, or as part of the community's criminal justice system or social service o r\u00ad ganizations. Additionally, these programs may be part of a faith - based organization, part of a national organization (su ch as Volun\u00ad teers of America or the Salvation Army), or an element of State or local government. Few programs at the community level attempt to meet all community housing needs. Some may focus primarily onemergency homelessness needs, others on Housing First, and still others on individuals with substance use disorders or mental illness in remission. 179 180 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Following are descriptions of four programs that reflect the range of available homelessness services in various communities. Their organ i\u00ad zational scope , target population, staff size, funding, and response s to community needs differ , yet all four have their origins in an ide n\u00ad tified community need that was addressed by program development and implementation. Responsibility House Responsibility House in New Orlea ns, LA, began in 1994 as a half way house for people recovering from substance use disorders. The programs of Responsibility House focus onproviding services to, and improving the lives of, the most underserved populations in the New Orleans area: indigent adults who have disabilit ies, such as substance use disorder s, serious mental illness, and/or HIV/AIDS, andpeople who are homeless. Contact person Mike Martyn, Executive Director: 504-367\u00ad 4426; mmartyn@rhousela.org Programs The Men's Residential Treatment Program offers 3 to 6 months of treatment services in a modified therapeutic community setting forpeople who have substance dependence. Cli\u00adents begin working on the 12 Steps, conn ect with sponsors, and perform community service while transitioning through four phases oftreatment: discovery, primary, work search, andreentry. Funding is contracted through the State with the Jefferson Parish Human Ser\u00advices Authority. Housing Opportu nities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) programming and services are available for adult m en who have substance dependence and are HIV positive. Fundingcomes from a U.S. Department of Housingand Urban Development (HUD) HOPWAgrant to the City of New Orleans; Responsi\u00adbility House is a subgrantee. Following prima\u00adry treatment, those interested in living in adrug-and alcohol -free, recovery -focused set\u00ad ting may apply for the Sober Living Program.The program is designed for adult m en who have at least 2 months o f demonstrated absti\u00ad nence and are employed. Responsibility House also offers an Outp a\u00ad tient Treatment Program for men and womenwho have a substance use disorder and/or aco-occurring mental illness and who are at least 18 years old. Group, individual, and fami\u00ad ly counseling are offered for recovery from substance use disorders. Funding is from the U.S. Probation Service, Access to Recovery,private pay, and some insurance providers. In 2000, Responsibility House began offering supportive housing to individuals and families who have disabilities and experience chronic homelessness. The goals of this program are toenable people who are homeless to maintainpermanent independent housing, to assist cli\u00ad ents in improving their financial independenceand living ski lls, and to support clients in their quest for self -sufficiency. Community collaboration In 2011, Responsibility House was presentedwith an award for Outstanding Homeless Ser\u00advice Provider by UNITY of Greater New O r\u00ad leans, the lead agency for the local Con tinuum of Care. Funding for the agency comes from HUD, the Jefferson Parish Community D e\u00ad velopment Block Grant, and several one -time grants from private foundations (Entergy, O r\u00ad ange County Foundation, and Greater New Orleans Foundation). Center for Urban Co mmunity Services The Center for Urban Community Services (CUCS) of New York , NY, provides a wide range of services to help individuals and 180 Part 2, Chapter 2 families who are homeless or were previously homeless (particularly those with behavioral or other disabling conditions) live full and sati s\u00ad fying lives in the community. In 2011, CUCS provided supportive housing services to 2,000people and mental health services to 3,000people; provided legal services, benefits, and/orother financial counseling to 5,500 adults andfamilies at four sites, including one inside Rikers Island jail; helped 13,000 people gainaccess to housing and/or case managementservices, working under contract to city and State mental health authorities; and trainedmore than 3,000 service provi ders from 300 nonprofit organizations. Contact person Tony Hannigan, Executive Director: 212 -801\u00ad 3300 Programs Clients' mental health and substance use issues are addressed in an integrated manner as a p\u00ad propriate to the program. Street outreach andplacemen t programs follow a strict Housing First approach, aided by motivational inte r\u00ad viewing to address specific aspects of mental illness or substance abuse. Transitional pr o\u00ad grams maintain the same tight focus on o b\u00ad taining permanent housing but are able tooffer integrated psychopharmacology using onsite psychiatric and medical treatment,along with an array of evidence -based practi c\u00ad es, including motivational interviewing, illness management and recovery, and co -occurring disorders skills groups. Permanent suppor tive housing programs use these same evidence - based practices to help tenants pursue a broadrange of personal goals and aspirations in a d\u00ad dition to embedded supported employment.Medical detoxification and residential bilitation are handled by partneri ng agencies. CUCS case managers follow clients enteringsuch programs, helping inform treatment andcoordinate transition planning. Community collaboration CUCS is passionate about the welfare of all its clients, the quality of all its programs, and the skills and commitment of all its staff members. Recent highlights include the agency's lead support role in the Manhattan Outreach Co n\u00ad sortium, which has reduced the Manhattanstreet homeless population by almost half by using an intensive Housing First model. The agency's Project for Psychiatric Outreach tothe Homeless recently received an AmericanPsychiatric Association Silver AchievementAward for providing services to thousands ofpeople who are currently homeless and people who had previously been homeless at 54 sites across the city. Another accomplishment is CUCS's shift to a culture of evidence- based practice and continuous, data -driven quality improvement. Serious challenges remain,however. Perhaps the most important is theneed to fully integrate primary medical care with mental health and substance abuse ser\u00advices. Even harder to solve is how to address the needs of New Y ork City's undocumented immigrants who are homeless, given r e\u00ad strictions imposed by most major funders. Open Arms Housing Open Arms Housing, Inc. (OAH) of Was h\u00ad ington, DC, provides permanent housing withongoing supportive services for unaccomp a\u00ad nied women who have lived on the streets or in shelters in Washington, DC. The organiz a\u00ad tion is dedicated to providing permanenthousing for vulnerable women who have pr e\u00ad viously been overlooked by current housingprograms and services for the homeless. OAHowns a building in Northwest Washington,DC, that opened in 2009 to house 16 women who have experienced a range of mental health issues, substance use disorders, andmedical conditions. 181 182 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Contact person Marilyn Kresky -Wolff, Executive Director: 202-525-3467 Program The OAH model is unique in DC in that it operates under a Housing First approach,which holds that all individuals are entitled to safe and decent housing and that access to this housing should not be contingent on partic i\u00ad pation in services. Those services can come later, but housing is first. The OAH model is one of only a few similar programs across the country because: The OAH model rests on the premise thatstable, safe housing is necessary to pr o\u00ad mote the physical, mental, and emotional well- being of all persons, particularly women with a history of chronic hom e\u00ad lessness. OAH offers onsite supportive services thatare tailored to ea ch individual's needs and are designed to prevent a return to home\u00adlessness. The building is designed to feature eff i\u00ad ciency units with a full set of kitchen a p\u00ad pliances and a private bathroom, andcommunity rooms with shared phones,TVs, computers, and space for workshops,meetings, and get -togethers. Addition ally, the building has three wheelchair -accessible units and a unit equipped for a deaf person; units like these are scarce . Onsite services provided by staff include: Outreach and engagement. Orientation to community living and as\u00adsistance in obtaining housing subsidies. Financial management and help with ac\u00adtivities of daily living. Supportive counseling and crisis interven\u00adtion. treatment teams, employment counseling,day programs, volunteer opportunities,self-help groups, medical treatment, home health care, and food and clothing re\u00ad sources . Community collaboration During the period from the founding of the organization until its opening in 2009, OAHreceived: Financial support from the DC Depar t\u00ad ment of Housing and Community Devel\u00adopment (DHCD) via a permanent loan and a grant jointly from DHCD and the DC Department of Mental Health. A Supportive Housing Program grantfrom HUD via the DC Community Par t\u00ad nership for the Prevention of Homeless\u00adness. Critical early support from private lenders(e.g., acquisition loan from the OpenD oor Housing Fund ). Predevelopment and construction funds from Cornerstone, Inc., construction loans from Local Initiatives Support Corpor a\u00ad tion and Enterprise Community Partners,and a capacity -building grant from the Corporation for Supportive Housing. Ongoing support through the DC Hou s\u00ad ing Authority's Local Rent SupplementProgram. Open Arms has served 17 tenants. Fourteen ofthe initial residents are still in the building.One original resident moved out after reco n\u00ad necting with family, and another moved to anapartment. No Open Arms resident has r e\u00ad turned to homelessness. Project Renewal Project R enewal in Ne w York , NY, is designed to help people who are homeless empowerthemselves and leave the streets for a return to L inkage to mental health treatment, alc o-health, homes, and jobs. Since 1967, it has cre\u00ad h ol and drug abuse counseling, assertive at ed innovative strategies to address the barr i\u00ad 182 Part 2, Chapter 2 ers that these men and women face. Services range from outreach to permanent housingand span case management, substance abuse and mental health services, primary medical care, and vocational rehabilitation. Contact person Mitchell Netburn, President and CEO: 212 \u00ad 620-0340 Programs One innov ative program of Project Renewal is In Homes Now (IHN), a Housing First mo d\u00ad el for chronically relapsing individuals who have substance use disorders and are homeless. It is designed to meet the special needs ofpeople who have experienced long -term homeles sness and have active substance use disorders. The program leases 110 apartments in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Brooklyn forparticipants, and a multidisciplinary team pr o\u00ad vides intensive case management, medical andmental health services, and occupational t her\u00ad apy, as well as socialization and recreationalactivities. All services are delivered in either the program office or the client's home. Staff members receive ongoing training in motiv a\u00ad tional interviewing and trauma -informed care. The culture of the program is one of no n\u00ad judgmental acceptance, and all interactions are centered on clients' needs rather than program rules. The relationship that develops betweenthe staff and the client s becomes a stabilizing force in the clients' lives, allowing the staff t o help guide client s toward a healthier lifestyle. Nearly all (97 percent) tenants have remainedstably housed over the past year. This success has led to the inclusion of harm -reduction beds in a key New York City -New York State supportive housing agreement. IHN operates from an office in Upper Manhattan that isviewed as a key factor for success because the office models itself after a drop -in center. Te n\u00ad ants come for socialization, for recreation, to meet with staff, or just to relax in a supportive community environment. Another program success is the ability to work with clients withco-occurring disorders and cognitive impai r\u00ad ments. The team's psychiatric nurse practitio n\u00ad ers treat such clients (about 75 percent),allowing integrat ion of treatment for m ental illness with other services. Occupational ther\u00adapists help clients who have never lived ind e\u00ad pendently master activities of daily living. Community collaboration Clients in In Homes Now are linked to co m\u00ad munity hospitals, methadone programs, andoutpatient clinics. About 25 percent of clients are veterans and receive services at the local VA medical center. Funding is received from HUD, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Sample Policies and Procedures As your organization increasingly provides services to people who are homeless, the needfor policies and procedures to cover staffmembers working off site, dealing with othercommunity agencies and partners, and r e\u00ad sponding to situations that are new to yourorganization will become clear. The policies and procedures presented in this section may alert you to areas where your organizationneeds additional guidelines. They refer to saf e\u00ad ty outside the office (for example, the \"No H e\u00ad roes Policy\"), safety during outreach activities, client transportation, and handling medicaland psychiatric emergencies in outreach set\u00adtings. A sample memorandum of understan d\u00ad ing (MOU) is also included at the end of this chapter. 183 184 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless No Heroes Policy Policy [Name of program] recognizes the need to address the safety of clinical and case ma n\u00ad agement staff persons who deliver services to clients outside of the organization setting andto provide resources to facilitate safe practice. Procedures A wide range of service activities are un\u00addertaken outside the office by clinical andcase management staff affiliated with the [name of program].

Routine community- based contacts with clients who are assessed to present low risk can be accomplished by an individual staffmember according to the procedures ou t\u00ad lined in this policy. Under no circumstances will any staffmember enter any situation that is felt tobe unsafe: - Any questions regarding the safety ofan intervention or activity will be r e\u00ad viewed and cleared by the Director of[name of program] or his/he r designee prior to undertaking the activity or i n\u00ad tervention in question. - Local police will be involved in all community visits that have been a s\u00ad sessed as having significant potentialfor violence. - When there is disagreement among the staff regarding the s afety of a pa r\u00ad ticular situation, the planned activitywill be suspended until consultationwith the Director of [name of pr o\u00ad gram] or his/her designee takes place. 184 Part 2, Chapter 2 - The circumstances listed below will trigger particular attention to safetyconcerns and will result in the abbrev i\u00ad ation or suspension of direct clinical contact in the community, pendingconsultation with the Director of [name of program] or his/her designee.Such consultation will address co n\u00ad cerns about the safety of the staff and of the client and/or others in the cl i\u00ad ent's environment or network. If fur\u00ad ther intervention is indicated, develop a plan to e nsure the safety of involved staff members, including consideration of the need for police escort during: a. Outreach to a client who is suspec t\u00ad ed of being under the influence of nonprescribed substances at the time of contact or whose enviro n\u00ad ment includes other individuals who are using substances. b. Outreach to a client who is suspec t\u00ad ed of or known to be carrying aweapon at the time of contact orwhos e environment includes ind i\u00ad viduals suspected of or known to be carrying weapons. c. Outreach to a client who becomes volatile or threatening during co n\u00ad tact or in a setting in which volatileor threatening behavior is observedor anticipated. d. Outreach to a client who has a known history of physical violence. All community visits for the purpose ofclient contact require that workers bring an activated beeper and cellular phone. Established sign -out procedures will be used to facilitate awareness of staff wher e\u00ad abouts and attention to the safety of staff persons working outside the office setting. Sign-out information will include: - Name(s) of all staff members to be i n\u00ad volved in outreach activity. - Destination. - Time of departure. - Anticipated time of return. - License plate number of vehicle being used. - Cellular phone number. - Beeper number (if applicable). If, in the course of providing community outreach, the staff begin s to suspect or o b\u00ad serve that the behavior of a client is expo s\u00ad ing a child, elderly person, or individual served by the Department of Mental R e\u00ad tardation to abuse or neglect \u2014including exposure to illicit activity or to circu m\u00ad stances that might imminently compr o\u00ad mise the safety of these individuals\u2014reports must be filed with the appropriate protective servi ces agency according to e s\u00ad tablished procedures for such reporting. All incidents that trigger safety concerns and/or require police/ambulance interven\u00adtion will be reported to the Director of[name of program] or his/her designee immediately following the i ncident. Also: - Following interventions triggering saf e\u00ad ty concerns and/or the assistance of thepolice or an ambulance, staff will co m\u00ad plete the Outreach Incident Report andan emergency response form doc u\u00ad menting the circumstances of the need for emergency services. A review will be scheduled. - Team -and p roject -based reviews will be held as quickly as possible followingall such incidents to facilitate discussion of issues related to staff safety, clienttreatment planning, and the interface between the project and the local police,as well as other emergency personnel. 185 186 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless Ensuring Safety During Street and Community Outreach Policy Street -level and community services will be provided through an interorganizational co l\u00ad laboration between [name of program] and other service agencies. The following street - level and community outreach procedures will serve as addenda to those outlined in the \"No Heroes Policy\" and will inform the work of all outreach staff. They will be reviewed and r e\u00ad vised yearly in collaboration with the involved network service agencies. Procedures These procedures will guide the work of pr o\u00ad ject staff members providing clinical or case management services in outdoor public places,such as street corners, the public green, underhighway bridges, and the like: The safety of all street outreach sites will be reviewed and approved by [name ofprogram] leaders prior to providing ou t\u00ad reach to those sites. Review will include the following factors: - Street outreach location s cannot be isolated and desola te. Staff members must always be visible to the street andbe able to access other people (includ\u00ading the general public) for assistance ina crisis situation. - The time of day is relevant to the saf e\u00ad ty of any specific street outreach site. - Differing numbers of staff members may be required to sustain safety at any particular outreach site. - Safety issues known to exist in the general area of any specific outreachsite may vary. The safety of all approved outreach sites will be reviewed quarterly and as needed so that changes in the safety of specific sites are reflected in the day- to-day list of a p\u00ad proved outreach sites. Street -level outreach may be conducted from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 p.m. - Between 7:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., co n\u00ad duct street -level outreach with at least two staff members. - Between 4:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., co n\u00ad duct street -level outreach with at least three staff members; one stays in the driver's seat of the outreach vehicle. - Street outreach to individuals with whom the outreach staff ha s little or no familiarity will be guided by the following principles: a. Such individuals will not be invited into an organization vehicle for pu r\u00ad poses of engaging in an interview orfor the provision of transportation. b. Efforts will be made to interview such individuals in community age n\u00ad cies or public buildings (e.g., the li\u00adbrary , a train station) instead of on public streets. The following procedures will guide the prov i\u00ad sion of clinical and case management services that take place inside community settings (e.g.,local shelters, soup kitchens, train stations, public libraries ): All indoor sites will be established in co l\u00ad laboration between the [name of program]leaders and the proposed community o r\u00ad ganization sites before using those sites foroutreach. The safety of each proposedcommunity outreach site depends uponthe following factors: - The community organization mustagree to have outreach staff members visit their site. - A contact person must be identifiedwithin each community organizationand must be available to outr each workers when they are on site to pr o\u00ad vide support. 186 Part 2, Chapter 2 - The community organization must agree to allow workers telephone access for emergencies. The following guidelines apply to outreachand clinical/case management services provi d\u00ad ed in either outdoor locations or s pecified i n\u00ad door community sites: At least one member of the outreach team will have an activated beeper and cellularphone. Street -level outreach activities may be conducted in [name of program] vehicles.[Name of program] staff can be grante d permission to drive the vehicles through aprocess initiated by the Director of the [name of program]. Use of vehicles b e\u00ad longing to any one of the involved affiliat\u00aded organizations will be guided by the policies and procedures established by thatorganization. Outreach activities will end if any outreach team member indicates serious concerns about the safety of any particular activity. All outreach workers will receive yearly project -based training in clinical and comm u\u00ad nity safety, and they will be eligi ble to partic i\u00ad pate in the Clinical Safety Training offered at[name of program], regardless of organizationaffiliation. Client Transport Policies and Procedures Policy The Director of [name of program] will esta b\u00ad lish procedures to guide staff decisionmaki ng regarding the transport of clients to enhance both the safety of the staff members providing transportation services and the safety of the clients they transport. This policy will serve as an addendum to the \"No Heroes Policy.\" Procedures Organization v ehicles may be driven only by staff persons who possess valid State drivers ' licenses. Under no circumstances will a staff me m\u00ad ber use his/her personal vehicle totransport a client. Organization vehicles will be used only tocarry out work -related duties . Vehicles are available primarily to facilitate the care ofregistered clients of [name of program].However, it is recognized that the transport of a client's nonregistered signi f\u00ad icant others is indicated at times the organization's ability to p rovide tran s\u00ad portation can also facilitate the process ofengaging nonregistered individuals whomight otherwise be reluctant to accept ser\u00advices. These circumstances will be viewed as exceptions and will be discussed andapproved by the relevant team leader , pro\u00ad gram leader, project director, or his/her designee. The provision of transportation to clientsand their significant others will be regar d\u00ad ed as a service, and the staff members who transport these individuals will be expectedto maintain the same pro fessional stan d\u00ad ards of practice that guide the provision ofall clinical services at [name of program].Clients' rights to safety and confidentiality will therefore be respected and protectedat all times. Staff persons will carry an activated cellu\u00ad lar pho ne when transporting clients. Organization vehicles used for clienttransport will be equipped with the fo l\u00ad lowing items for emergencies (e.g., acc i\u00ad dental injuries, inclement weather): - An operable flashlight - Snow scraper - Personal protection gloves - First-aid kit - List of emergency phone numbers 187 188 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless - Information regar ding vehicle insu r\u00ad ance coverage - Reflective safety triangles Staff will make a general inspection of the organization vehicle before driving it tomake sure that there is adequate fuel andthat there are no objects within or outside the vehicle that might compromise thesafety of the driver or other vehicle occ u\u00ad pants. The driver of any organization vehicle willmaintain responsibility for ensuring thatall vehicle occupants honor relevan t seat\u00ad belt laws, including laws governing the use of child safety seats when applicable. The number of passengers transported inan organization vehicle will not exceed thevehicle's stated capacity, and team- , pro\u00ad gram -, and project -identified staff -to\u00ad client ratios will be honored. Clients who are symptomatically unstable and whose behavior may be impulsive and/or unpredictable will not be transpor t\u00ad ed in an organization vehicle, includingclients suspected of being under the influ\u00adence of any nonprescribed drug. Safety concerns that arise at any point during the course of transporting a client will result intermination of the transport. Clients will not be left unattended by thestaff in an organization vehicle. Clients needing hospitalization will gener\u00adally be transported via ambulance. Any ex\u00adceptions will be reviewed and approved by the appropriate team leader, program lea d\u00ad er, project director, or his/her designeeand will be based on a thorough assess\u00adment of client needs and the availability ofthe resources necessary to facilitate safe transport. Factors that will preclude the transportation in a vehicle of a client need\u00ad ing hospitalization include, but are notlimited to: - The p resence of medical needs better addressed in an ambulance. - Client history of violence, impulsiv ity, substance use, or other factors that might contribute to unpredictability during transport. - The lack of at least two clinicians or case managers available to assist in the transport of the client. Management of Psychiatric and Medical Emergencies Policy Procedures will be established to guide the handling of psychiatric or medical emerge n\u00ad cies within the office or in the community thatrequire resources beyond the scope of [name of program] services. When a medical emer\u00adgency occurs, basic life support, first aid, and immediate emergency care will be given until the arrival of emergency medical service (EMS) personnel, who will provide any fur\u00adther emergency treatment and transport to the emergency department (ED). Purpose To facilitate the safety of clie nts served by the [name of program] and the safety of team orproject staff. Procedures Section A: Psychiatric /medical emergencies that occur within the office will be managed as follows: Staff members involved in the manag e\u00ad ment of a psychiatric or medical emergen\u00ad cy will dial 911 to access emergency services or will use the panic button system available within the office. If possible, one staff member will announce a Code 3 on the overhead telephone paging system,specify whether the code is medical, andnote the location of the code. All available clinical staff persons will r e\u00ad spond. 188 Part 2, Chapter 2 The first senior staff member on the scene will take charge of a psychiatric code. The first senior medically trained staff memberon the scene will take charge of a medical code. If the code bag and first -aid kits are not present, the staff member will directanother staff member to bring this equi p\u00ad ment to the scene. If no medical personnel are available, the first person on the scene will be in charge of the code, direct basicsupport and first -aid to the victim, and designate someone to bring the code bagand first -aid kit. A staff member should gather relevant cl i\u00ad ent data to provide to EMS and the ED.When EMS arrives, care of the victim in a medical code will be handed off t o them. In the event of a psychiatric code, the staffmember in charge of the code will manage the code collaboratively with EMS. The s taff member in charge of the code will gather interim assistance from otherstaff working in the office at the time ofthe emergency. If the incident is in the o f\u00ad fice, a program supervisor will also facil i\u00ad tate the management of other clients whomay be on site at the time of an emergen\u00adcy. These interventions will be guided by an appreciation of the importance of pr o\u00ad tecting a ll clients exposed to emergencies and of the need to preserve the rights, di g\u00ad nity, and well- being of all involved clients. The clin ician and supervisor managing in- house psychiatric or medical emergencies are responsible for the completion of do c\u00ad umentation needed to facilitate transport to an ED and will facilitate continuity ofcare for the client by communicating rele\u00ad vant information to ED care providers. After the care of the victim has been co m\u00ad pletely assumed by EMS, staff should: - Inform the client's family or emergen\u00adcy contact persons. - Inform appropriate administrative staff persons. - Address and allay the anxiety of clients who witnessed the incident. - Meet to review the incident as soon as possible after it occurs. The involved clinician will complete an incident report and an emergency response form documenting the circumstances ofthe need for emergency services, and a r e\u00ad view will be scheduled. A note will be entered into the medical record reflecting the circumstances of the emergency and the outcome of plannedinterventions. Following a medical code, the [position ofperson responsible] will direct a memberof the nursing department to check thelock on the code bag. If the lock is broken,the nursing staff member will call [name,phone number] to ch eck and replace co n\u00ad tents. Section B: P sychiatric or medical emergencies that occur in the community will be handled as follows: Staff members involved in handling a psy\u00ad chiatric or medical emergency in the community will use their cell phones tocall the local police department directly orto call 911 to access emergency services. Acall to 911 from a cell phone will access State Police, who will contact local police. A program supervisor will be notified ofthe emergency and will facilitate the d e\u00ad ployment of additional staff resources as needed. A first -aid kit is kept in each vehicle to facilitate interim management of medical emergenc ies. No code bag is stored in v e\u00ad hicles. Documentation needed to facilitate transport to an ED will be completed by the clinician most involved in the emer\u00adgency situation. The involved clinician will also give relevant client information to ED 189 190 Behavioral Health Services for People Who Are Homeless care providers to facilitate continuity of care. Procedures 3 through 9 as outlined in Sec\u00adtion A of this policy will be f ollowed. Sample Forms Recordkeeping is a necessary part of engagingpeople who are homeless in services and trac k\u00ad ing the course of these individuals' contacts with service organizations. When possible,records should be kept electronically and up\u00addated as n ew information becomes available.

Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs) are the products of a systematic and innovative process that brings together clinicians, researchers, program managers, policymakers, and other Federal and non - Federal experts to reach consensus on state- of-the-art treatment practices. TIPs are developed under CSA T's Knowledge Application Program to improve the treatment capabilities of the Nation's alcohol and drug abuse treatment service system. What Is a Quick Guide? A Quick Guide clearly and concisely presents the primary information from a TIP in a pocket -sized booklet. Each Quick Guide is divided into sections to help readers quickly locate relevant material. Some contain glossaries of terms or lists of resources. Page numbers from the original TIP are referenced so pr o\u00ad viders can refer back to the s ource document for more information. What Are KAP Keys? Also based on TIPs, KAP Keys are handy, durable tools. Keys may include assessment or screening i n\u00ad struments, checklists, and summaries of treatment phases. Printed on coated paper, each KAP Keys set is fastened together with a key ring and can be kept within a treatment provider's reach and consulted fr e- quently.The Keys allow you, the busy clinician or program administrator, to locate information easily and to use this information to enhance treatmen t services.
