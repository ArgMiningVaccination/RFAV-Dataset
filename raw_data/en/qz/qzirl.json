N/A Have you ever been arrested or involved in any criminal proceedings? If so, please explain: Never Have you ever been involved in any civil lawsuits or declared personal or professional bankruptcy? If so, please explain: Never What is an example of how you led a team or group toward achieving an important goal? Serving as Committee Chair for the 2010 American Kannada Kootas of America (AKKA) Conference, I utilized my position to bring a philanthropic endeavor to the forefront of our convention participants - a two-day blood drive benefiting Carter Blood Care. Our goal: raise 50 units of whole blood and platelets to benefit those in need throughout the state of New Jersey. I chose the blood drive because as a nurse and case manager, I believe that blood is the most precious donation you can make to your community. To meet this goal, I assembled a team, educated them about the impact a blood drive can have on a community, and delegated responsibilities to each member of the team. Additionally, I handled logistics and deployment with the set-up and two-day event with Carter Blood Care. Lastly, I coordinated and scheduled meetings from end to end to guarantee benchmarks were achieved and the event was successful. In total we exceeded the goal of 50 units and acquired 64 units of blood and plasma for the community in just two days. This is because we worked as a team with everyone contributing something to mission, we prescribed deadlines with specific deliverables, and galvanized all internal and external resources. Why are you running for this office? The passion for serving the community is in my genes. In India, my family built and donated a 100-bed maternity hospital in my hometown. Additionally, kids who needed shelter in order to attend school while their parents resided in the local villages would stay at our home for free. Also, the United States has afforded me many opportunities. As was the case in India, these opportunities made me grow myself and think about serving the community where I live. More granularly, in Frisco, I have built a life here. I am raising my family here. I want to set the expectation and example for them to continue our family's tradition of public service. Lastly, I believe firmly in the philosophy that many hands make light of the work, especially when a good leader with a plan and vision is in charge. I want to be that leader. I want to use this position to make my children's hometown better and safer for them, their friends, our neighbors, and future generations. Why should voters choose you over your opponent? My residents will vote for me for the following reasons: Sai stands for Sincerity Accountability Integrity which means... My representation will be residents voice in City council. I am very transparent and can be reached 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I hold myself accountable and will be easily accessible to our citizens. I will listen to their concerns and answer their questions. I am a good listener, understand our citizens' desires, and act upon them. I will be accountable and not blame others for my actions or lack thereof. I will discuss decisions in open meetings and make sure that our citizens understand the reasoning behind my votes. I will be fiscally responsible with Frisco taxpayers' money. I will work with the Mayor, council, and city departments to develop a long-range plan to aggressively pursue commercial, industrial, and retail developments, and public-private partnerships to broaden our city's tax base so that we do not keep increasing sales and property taxes. I will work with the Mayor and council to make sure we balance the budget and avoid financial burdens without making sure that all citizens know and understand what this will mean to them. I will work to ensure balanced, smart growth with our Mayor, council, and planning and economic development staff. The more our population grows, the more our roads, sidewalks, plumbing, etc. will be stressed. We must balance our residential footprint with commercial, industrial, and retail developments to support the infrastructure, amenities, and services that our city deserves. Our city's population will also continue to grow, and along with this growth we need to strategically plan for and actively recruit commercial growth. We need industry and high-tech engineering and manufacturing companies to choose Frisco as their home. We need to augment retail growth by recruiting companies which will employ hundreds of well-paid workers. People want to live here; we want them to work here too. Length of residency in Texas and, if applicable, within the district or jurisdiction of the specific office you are seeking: I have resided in Texas for 5 years and in Frisco for 3 years. What prior service have you had on city boards or commissions? I have not served on city boards or commissions, but I am a born leader who has led large teams of healthcare workers and other non-profit endeavors. Describe your reaction to the protests in the wake of the killing of George Floyd. Do you support the protests, and why or why not? What actions would you take if elected to address concerns raised during these protests or as result of them? All human life is precious. On the most basic, human level I understand the pain and frustration that is associated with the seemingly senseless death of George Floyd among others. I am sorry families' losses the and I empathize greatly with each. Through my work in the nursing field, I have seen families mourn inconsolably all too often. No matter the circumstance grief is never easy. With that said, I support peaceful protests as they have served as the backbone for many of the most positive, long lasting, and systemic changes that have taken place in our nation's history. This is juxtaposed to the self-serving looting and riots that take place, devastating communities and granting ill-gotten reparations to those who feel entitled. This emotional reaction of rioting does not allow to cooler heads and logic to prevail. When they do, we can and utilize the investigatory process and Sunshine Laws to ensure the system is doing the right thing and holding the right parties accountable. As a city official and private citizen I would take part in the peaceful protests happening in the community. I would also go door-to-door in whatever framework that is based on social distancing guidelines, social media and local press to communicate the information regarding the situation as it came available, dispel rumors, discuss sentiments, and layout an action plan for the catharsis and results the citizens need in a productive, dignified way. If elected, what role, if any, would you take in implementing public health measures to combat COVID-19? Assess the federal, state and local response to COVID-19, specifically addressing each. As a newly elected Council Member, I promise to work with the city and other stakeholders to create a task force where we will review all COVID disaster plans and see what is currently in place. Next, the team and I will compare these plans with cities throughout the nation, New York City in particular as it was hardest hit by the crisis at the onset, and learn what best practices were put in place and mobilized in order to achieve gains as quickly as possible in the areas of residents, tourists, commerce, hospitality, commerce, healthcare and more. Then we will compare and contrast the city or cities situationally with Frisco and augment their recommendations with our current plans where they make sense. Finally, we will create action steps as to when and if we need to mobilize to mitigate risk and prevent a devastating aftermath. Each of these steps will be communicated to the citizenry consistently throughout the process. Emphasis on evidence based practice and always have plan B and implement when needed. A resource that I have already found great value in exists in https://www.usmayors.org/ What are the three most important actions you would take, if elected, and how would you advance them and pay for them? Increase govt interactions within the community in the subdivision levels, Police officers and kids often have a special bond. Police officers have a unique opportunity to positively influence the lives of countless children to become productive members of society when they grow up. They can quite literally turn a kid's life around with one interaction. They come to the rescue at the scene of a traffic collision or a house fire. They walk the halls of the school, not only enforcing the law and school policy, but providing mentorship and friendship to kids who might otherwise feel shunned. With each positive police interaction, officers are \u2014 hopefully \u2014 making deposits in the Bank of Goodwill, creating lasting memories of being \"the helper\" and \"the good guy.\" Pedestrian footbridge or Skywalk for the schoolkids crossing the roads to reach school and back: The main advantage of pedestrian footbridges is that they separate pedestrians from road traffic. As a result, footbridges (and stopping pedestrians from crossing the roadway at-grade) may reduce pedestrian accidents up to 90%. In terms of traffic, pedestrian bridges can mitigate traffic burdens because pedestrians do not need to wait for a signal light, and vehicle traffic can run more smoothly. In terms of the environment, smooth driving can not only decrease fuel consumption but also reduce the total emission exhaust. Conducting Town Hall Meetings or virtual Town Hall Meetings to poll constituency the before signing anything measure: The purpose of town hall meetings is for local and regional officials to hear the community's views on public issues. To keep the dialogue honest, warm and free-flowing, I will moderate it personally and have no specific rules other than an agenda to keep us focused on covering all of the business at hand followed by a question and answer session if needed. Where does the development or redevelopment emphasis need to be in your community \u2014 residential or commercial \u2014 and how has your city government performed in this area? City has done a good job and the Mayor Jeff Cheney, but there is always room to improve as the city grows and attracts more business and residents to be mindful of infrastructure, city trails, parks, green space, Most important - in parks need to have a patrol for safety. For example, instead building one big library, we could have turned that into 4-6 small libraries around the city and have avoided the big crowd of kids and parents. Secondly, we would have not worried about safety in the long run. Also we could have avoided the traffic and especially time for parents. What challenging demographic changes have been taking place in your city? What would your response be, if elected? Frisco is now community akin to a salad bowl - Whites, African American, Indian, Hispanics, Chinese, Vietnamese, etc. being committed diversity. Indian community is growing. Unless opportunities and gains are shared equitably in the community among all workers, owners, and business leaders, we will not have strong, ongoing economic growth. Inequality among ethnic groups, women, LGBTQ, and people with disabilities hinders prosperity for all and fuels the need for safety nets in lieu of self-empowerment, independence, dignity and respect. Much of this inequality stems from long-standing, systemic and structural inequities in the economy that have kept certain groups from having a fair chance to get ahead. Unfortunately the playing field is not yet level. If elected I will use my office and world view work to correct these debilitating norms by challenging the status quo, bringing our collective voice and interests together to develop and support policy for sound business strategy and practices that will ensure a sustainable, healthy economy for an increasingly diverse global school system. Assess the project for Keurig Dr Pepper to move its Texas headquarters to the Dallas Cowboys' Star development. Do favor the Frisco city council's decision to sell the 2.5-acre building site for about $600,000 - less than a fourth of the current property value? Why or why not? Pluses and minuses exist; however, City could have done better negotiations on this deal,but I don't want to discuss the past things. We should always think future and plan appropriately and learn from our mistakes. At the same time I believe It is beneficial to receive the bulk about at once, even though it is less than the market value, because we will continue to make financial gains as the company continues to grow, pay taxes, create jobs and more. I look at it like an annuity. We agree to a onetime payment and reap the dividends throughout time. What's your view on how the city council has handled negotiations with Exide Technologies to clean up areas still contaminated by the closed battery recycling plant. This clearly shows the failures in every stage of all responsible entity. The officers were irresponsility and have not excercised their roles and responsibility on their designated job. They should be accountable for the issue. It is not just city council, there are other government entities that must deal with and manage this major issue. It will need to be a prioritized task as it is a very vast subject. Focus on the action rather than blaming eachothers. Please assess crime in your city and what, if anything, you would do to try to improve or change. Frisco city has lower rate of crime than the state average and has lowered instances of crime increasingly over the past several years. With that said, I would absolutely partner on this and other efforts with the police department to find ways to deliver heightened services without the need for increased spending. We really appreciate our Frisco Police Department. Do you prefer to reduce funding for police in your city, increase funding, or keep it level? Please explain. My Six Sigma training has taught me that there is always room for improvement. As such I would aim to keep spending level and identify ways to improve the quality of the output of a process by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing impact variability in manufacturing and business processes. It uses a set of quality management methods, mainly empirical, statistical methods, and creates a special infrastructure of people within the organization who are experts in these methods. Each Six Sigma project carried out within an organization follows a defined sequence of steps and has specific value targets, for example: reduce process cycle time, reduce pollution, reduce costs, increase customer satisfaction, and increase profits. A six-sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects. Does your city deliver services in the most cost-effective manner? Please be specific about improvements you would advocate. As a resident and candidate for city government, I do see at least one significant area to improve essential service delivery - air and ground transportation to area emergency rooms. At this time neither insurance nor taxes cover this type of medical transportation. As such, we need to look at solutions other parts of the country including my initial state of residency, Pennsylvania, have employed. It involves ambulance or EMS membership programs for ground or air services. These programs are most often designed to charge an annual fee to members, who - in return - receive financial benefits of some kind. The benefits typically involve the write-off or reduction of out-of-pocket charges, or a discount on the services, after insurance has been billed, or even write-off the entire bill if the member is uninsured. Memberships vary in length and when they can go into effect (i.e., immediately or after a waiting period). Annual membership fees can range anywhere between $45-135 per year, depending on the coverage options: Who is covered (e.g., individual, individual and spouse or everyone living in the household) What is covered (e.g., ground transport, air transport or both) How long the membership lasts (e.g., 1 year, 3 years, lifetime) Discounts (e.g., for military or first responders) Membership programs not only provide a community benefit to those we serve but can also be a modest alternative revenue source for most EMS services, even after the write-offs occur. If an agency has a program or plans to develop one, the following key elements can ensure an ambulance membership program is effective. Please assess the property taxes levied by your city and whether it has the right balance between its residential and commercial base. Would you take any initiatives in this area? Presently, property tax is not balanced. Frisco should not tax its residents simply because the market is high. There needs to be a standard tax and when property is sold any additional money based on the purchase price of the house has to be taxed to nearest $100,000 to keep uniformity. I will definetely press on keeping the taxes low and fetch the funds from state and federal. How would you improve the quality of life in your city and, if appropriate, pay for any added programs? I would like to create a community enrichment program where volunteers agree to share their knowledge and passions in areas of the dramatic arts, writing, cooking, gardening and more. The city already has community centers, parks, and other spaces for these interactive learning experiences to be held. Participants would simply pay a modest fee for materials and/or an expert instructor's time in needed. Please rate the transparency of decision-making in your city hall. This is a three-tiered approach: I would conduct Town Hall Meetings or virtual Town Hall Meetings to poll constituency the before signing anything measure. The purpose of town hall meetings is for local and regional officials to hear the community's views on public issues. To keep the dialogue honest, warm and free-flowing, I will moderate it personally and have no specific rules other than an agenda to keep us focused on covering all of the business at hand followed by a question and answer session if needed. Additionally, I would also go door-to-door in whatever framework that is based on social distancing guidelines to communicate the information regarding any important situation as it came available and obtain feedback. Lastly, I would use online media and local media to dispel rumors, discuss sentiments, layout action plans and provide a phone number and email where I can be reached 24/7 to serve the people and communicate with them most effectively. What is an uncomfortable truth about your city that voters must confront? The difficult truth is that when something goes wrong in government the first line of defense from a human psychology perspective is denial. This must be addressed head on. Since the last election for City council, our residents will recall their memory about how many times \"their elected Council man visited their sub-division over the period of 3 years, and educated on every important decisions took place in City\". Did the Council man poll the opinion and considered the opinion before he voted/opposed on the decisions took place in city. Our residents are very smart, this time game plan is different and they will make a wise judgement on electing me as their new Council man. I will be transparent and can be reached 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I hold myself accountable and will be easily accessible to our citizens. My cell phone number is 302-401-8768. I will listen to their concerns and answer their questions. I am a good listener, understand our citizens' desires, and act upon them. I will be accountable and not blame others for my actions or lack thereof. I will discuss decisions in open meetings and make sure that our citizens understand the reasoning behind my votes. A growing number of residents are concerned about booming development eroding the suburban experience/lifestyle that brought them to their community in the first place. What is your point of view on this growing tension and how would you navigate the challenge? Like a growing family we need to assess the needs with each new addition and not just on a superficial level. Accommodating much-needed growth in public safety personnel without diminishing other public services is going to be a significant yet important challenge. We're going to have to do that by growing our tax base and not just rely on tax increases. The state has tied another hand behind the city's back. Property values go up in part because services and amenities are improving. We must figure out how to stave off a decline if we can't make improvements in the city's services and infrastructure. We must plan and learn where cities in the north mis-stepped to assuage the erosion of our beautiful Frisco. Likewise, the increase in apartment units, including new high-density developments, are raising resident alarm. What is your stand on multi family housing and what multi-family would you/would you not support? We need to start somewhere from small and think big. Initially everyone start with apartment/sharing and I believe multi-family living offers those with limited financial resources to take advantage of places of growth and prosperity like Frisco. I support any multi-family situation that has been previously approved to build by city to the land owners. There is nothing that we could as an any elected official stop OR deny for multi-family growth. But at the same time we should emphasis to enhance the culture, safety and prosperity of Frisco while nurturing families at varying income levels to build their own version of the American Dream in our backyard. But always it should be balanced. How would you bridge the gap between the very real need for municipal funding with the blowback related to rising property taxes? My apologies for the repetition but I would like to use the same answer here I as I did for question 14. My Six Sigma training has taught me that there is always room for improvement. As such I would aim to keep spending level and identify ways to improve the quality of the output of a process by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing impact variability in manufacturing and business processes. It uses a set of quality management methods, mainly empirical, statistical methods, and creates a special infrastructure of people within the organization who are experts in these methods. Each Six Sigma project carried out within an organization follows a defined sequence of steps and has specific value targets, for example: reduce process cycle time, reduce pollution, reduce costs, increase customer satisfaction, and increase profits. A six-sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects. Utilizing tax money wisely and also press on fetching more funding from state and feredal is also my priority. In order to cut taxes or keep them low, specifically what would you cut? Utilizing the tax in effective way on needs rather wants. If you support the Effective Tax Rate, what will you do when property values go down, as they inevitably will from time to time? Property values going up and down is not new and it is a pattern, depends on the financial market trend. It is beyond my control. Financial analysts will find a solution for this. Most all suburbs have aging infrastructure. How will you pay for infrastructure maintenance, especially if oppose density and/or favor Effective Tax Rate? Currently, the cost of public safety expenditures \u2014 police, fire and municipal court services \u2014 is more than the amount the city collects in property taxes for its general fund. And the Police Department continues to be short-handed and is still shrinking. With that said, over the next two years, accommodating much-needed growth in public safety personnel without diminishing other public services is going to be a significant challenge. We're going to have to do that by growing our tax base and not just rely on tax increases The state has tied another hand behind the city's back. Property values go up in part because services and amenities are improving. We must figure out how to stave off a decline if we can't make improvements in the city's services and infrastructure. If we cannot come up with how to make these invests, we only need to look to the north and east to cities like Detroit to know the perils heading our way. What is your vision for the future of your community? My vision for the citizens of Frisco is to use the trust and benevolent authority of the office in which I hope to be elected to create a haven where residents of all ages feel safe and secure living and pursuing their dreams. However, this can only be done under the protection our executive branch. On the local level this is the Frisco Fire and Police Department. The Frisco Fire Department always saves lives in an fire accident and also on other crisis. They also play vital role in our daily lives. The Frisco P.D. is involved in our everyday lives. They patrol our streets, our sidewalks, and our public spaces, and are often first on the scene when crime breaks out and when disaster strikes. They support people in crisis. They are \u2014 and have been for nearly two centuries \u2014 our nation's first responders. As a candidate for Frisco City Council, Place 6, I believe we need a common language so we can work together to promote public safety while protecting civil rights. We need to work at the national, state, and local levels \u2014 in our communities \u2014 to realize a shared vision of public safety that respects and protects human life. We need innovative ideas \u2014 from all perspectives in our diverse society \u2014 to rethink public safety and renew community trust. My personal stance is not to defund the police department nor is it to cut departmental personnel or resources in anyway. However, with my Sigma Six training, I believe that by conducting a thorough audit of budgets and their allocations and uses, we can maintain our current capacity and presence while being increasing fiscal responsibility. Moreover, I believe the department will need to take less punitive action if education and community bridge-building shows the citizenry that we are all working towards the same utopian goals. Lastly, as our city's population increases we will also be able to increase the number of officers themselves. Therein, we find our voice as one community. Need help?
