This comes after Norway's health authorities said they would not recommend them for children aged 5-11. Norway's decision is based on the latest Omicron data, whereas Denmark still bases its child vaccine recommendations on the Delta variant, paediatrician Klaus Birkelund Johansen, chairman of the Danish Pediatric Society, said. According to Johansen, the National Board of Health should reassess the efficacy of vaccinating children in light of the new Omicron variant. \"When countries that are comparable to Denmark look at the same data and come to different conclusions, I can understand why Danish parents find it difficult to decide what to do\", he said. In Norway, health authorities stressed that the vaccine is most relevant for children with chronic diseases or children in contact with particularly vulnerable persons. The Danish health authorities did not comment, but PM Mette Frederiksen made a few remarks. \"Of course, the authorities are constantly considering what is the best thing to do, including when it comes to children. Until now, the recommendation from the health authorities has been clear and unequivocal: vaccinate your children. And if that changes at some point, the authorities will, of course, have to tell the Danes about it,\" Frederiksen said. In total, 27.4% of those aged 5-11 have been fully vaccinated in Denmark, while 41.1% have only received their first shot.
