State Action Plan - Cross-Cutting/Systems Building", "date": "2012-02-22", "cleaned_text": "Public health research and data show that generations-long social, economic, and environmental inequities, including structural racism and other forms of discrimination and their consequences, have resulted in adverse health outcomes. For example, segregation in housing and education and racist mortgage lending and zoning policies have historically advantaged white Americans and disadvantaged communities of color. Together, these policies and practices have a greater influence on health outcomes than individual choices or access to healthcare. These inequities have been shaped by the distribution of power, money, and resources at the global, national, and local levels. Reducing health inequities through policies, practices, and organizational systems can help improve opportunities for every Rhode Islander. Rhode Island had the following priorities for cross-cutting systems building from October 1, 2019 to September 30 2020: - Improve system coordination - Improve mental/behavioral health - Adopt social determinants of health in public health planning Priority: Improve System Coordination The following strategies support RIDOH's priority to improve system coordination: Develop certification process & core competencies for MCH workforce statewide through Community Health Worker workforce development initiatives RI has benefited from a Certification Program for Community Health Workers since 2016. To date, there are 340 Certified Community Health Workers in RI, each with demonstrated competency in the following domains: Domains - Engagement Methods and Strategies - Individual and Community Assessment - Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Responsiveness - Promote Health and Well-Being - Care Coordination and System Navigation - Public Health Concepts and Approaches - Advocacy and Community Capacity Building - Safety and Self-Care - Ethical Responsibilities and Professional Skills Standards - Experience: Six months or 1000 hours of paid or volunteer work experience within five years - Supervision: 50 hours specific to the domains - Education: 70 hours relevant to the domains - Portfolio: Demonstrated competency through approved portfolio. The portfolio is a collection of personal and professional activities and achievements. This part of the requirement for the Community Health Worker is highly personalized and no two applicants will submit the same documentation. Components of the portfolio include documentation and requirements of at least three of these categories: Community Experience & Involvement Research Activities College Level Courses / Advanced or Specialized Training Community Publications Presentations & Projects Statement of Professional Experience Achievements / Awards Resume / Curriculum Vitae (CV) Performance Evaluation Training and Development - RI MCH Program partners with the following training entities for CHW education and preparation: - Community Health Innovations of RI provides ongoing training and apprenticeship opportunities especially for CHWs based in the community through health Equity Zones - Rhode Island College Healthy Jobs offers ongoing CHW courses at Central Falls Parent College, Rhode Island College campus in Providence throughout the academic term, and in a centralized Warwick location - RIDOH Chronic Disease Programs offers core community health worker training and modules specific to patient navigators working in chronic disease through the CHWARI. - Rhode Island Parent Information Network provides ongoing training opportunities for Resource Specialist including parents of children with special healthcare needs - Clinica Esperanza sponsors ongoing Navagante trainings for Bilingual / Bicultural CHWs. All of these training programs have aligned their curriculum with Rhode Island's Certified Community Health Worker standards meeting the certification requirements. RI MCH Program also partners with the Department of Labor & Training in supporting the Community Health Worker Association of Rhode Island (CHWARI) at Rhode Island College. CHWARI is an organization to provide CHWs resources around trainings and other professional development opportunities. The Community Health Worker Association of Rhode Island (CHWARI) actively supports frontline healthcare workers who work in underserved communities to improve high quality healthcare access for people in need. CHWARI envisions a state in which all Rhode Island communities receive high quality, equitable health and social services in order for all individuals to realize their optimal state of health and well-being. The mission of CHWARI is to increase the power of Rhode Island's Community Health Workers to promote health equity through increasing access to quality healthcare and social services and conducting advocacy. Facilitate Interdepartmental, interagency, and statewide discussion to improve the health care delivery system RI MCH Leadership facilitates interdepartmental, interagency and statewide discussion around Title V programs through participation on a variety of tables: EOHHS Partnership Meeting: RI MCH Leadership plans for and conducts a monthly stakeholder engagement meeting with the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) called the EOHHS Partnership meeting. This meeting draws between 50-75 advocates, consumers, providers, and state agency representatives to review Medicaid policy and program, grant opportunities, Medicaid redesign initiatives, barriers to coordinated care, Medicaid budget and spending, and Medicaid legislative proposals. Many of these topics affect MCH populations, especially children and youth with special needs. Children's Cabinet: The RI Children's Cabinet provides overarching leadership and a comprehensive, strategic approach necessary to improve the well-being of RI's children and youth. Its members engage in shared planning and decision making, interagency agreements to implement policy or programs, and appropriate data-sharing to improve services and outcomes for children and youth. The Cabinet is comprised of the Secretary of the Executive Office of Health and Human Services, the Commissioner of Elementary & Secondary Education, the Director of the Dept. of Health, the Child Advocate, the Director of the Dept. of Human Services, the Director of the Dept. of Administration, Director of the Dept. of Labor and Training, the Director of the Dept. of Children, Youth & Families, the Director of Dept. of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities & Hospitals, and the Commissioner of Post-Secondary Education. The overall goals of the Cabinet are to: - Improve the health, education, and well-being of all children and youth in RI. - Increase the efficacy, efficiency, and coordination of service delivery. - Improve data-driven, evidence-based decision-making through strengthened data sharing capacities among agencies and research partners, while adequately protecting the privacy rights of children. In 2020, RIDOH worked with the Children's Cabinet to continue to implement activities in the Preschool Development Funding. This grant enabled RIDOH to fund Health Equity Zones to implement evidence-based parent education and support programs and to embed family navigators into early childhood programs. The goal of the navigators is to help families understand and access services that they need. The grant also funds the expansion of the parents as Teachers program by 300 slots. Patient Centered Medical Home-Kids (PCMH-Kids): PCMH-Kids is an initiative of the Care Transformation Collaborative of Rhode Island (CTC-RI) which is a statewide multi-payer patient centered medical home initiative. CTC-RI is co-convened by the Executive Office of Health and Human Services and the Office of Health Insurance Commissioner. RIDOH MCH leadership participates in PCMH-Kids leadership planning activities, committee meetings, and work groups. PCMH-Kids was founded in 2015 as a pediatric primary care patient-centered medical home initiative that is driven by data, quality care and collaboration. Practices receive financial support and technical assistance to achieve NCQA recognition as a patient-centered medical home, meet state established clinical quality measures, and participate in quality improvement activities on important child and youth health topics. Cohorts of practices enroll for three years. In January 2019, the third cohort of pediatric practices signed on. Currently there are 37 pediatric and family medicine practices participating in the PCMH-Kids initiative, including 260 primary care providers and trainees, covering over 110,000 lives, and representing more than 80% of the state's pediatric Medicaid population. PCMH-Kids successes include: - Improved developmental screening of all children age 9-30 months from a baseline of 41% screened to 85.9% screened which is fundamental to the Governor's Children's Cabinet third grade reading readiness initiative - Improved obesity screening and counseling from a baseline of 55% to 85.8% - Developed and implemented a pediatric specific high-risk framework to identify children and families that would benefit from care coordination services - Reduced Emergency Department usage by 2.5% compared with non-PCMH practices Practices have also embraced a pediatric vision of care coordination and integrated behavioral health, using a model that includes practice-based social workers as care coordinators. Accomplishments in integrating behavioral health services into primary care include: - ADHD screening, diagnosis and treatment plans - Maternal postpartum depression screening: baseline of 22% to 87% with implementation of referral protocols for intervention - Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral, and Treatment (SBIRT) in the adolescents with 75 providers with a total pediatric population of ~34,000 - In 2020, RIDOH will continue collaborating with the CTC to support PCMH-Kids practices in integrating Family Home Visiting within the Medical Home and doing joint care coordination for families facing adversity. RIDOH MCH programs work closely with PCMH-Kids to support medical home efforts. KIDSNET, the state's integrated child health information system, works with providers to create reports that practices can use for patient care. Practices can utilize this centralized database to identify children in need of newborn hearing screening, immunizations, lead screening, developmental screening, Kindergarten readiness screening as well as participation in other early childhood programs such as WIC, Family Visiting Programs, and Early Intervention. KIDSNET recently worked with PCMH-Kids to develop a new practice report to identify newborns and young children with medical and family risk factors that would benefit from care coordination and referrals for support. In 2020 RIDOH received a Healthy Tomorrows Partnership for Children grant to improve communication between primary care and home visiting programs and implement a process for integrated care coordination. PCMH-Kids will partner with RIDOH to implement this work. To date two practices and two family visiting agencies have worked together. Aligning MCH research to impact system development To support Rhode Island in achieving its goal that 75% of 3rd graders will read at grade level by 2025. Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH), in collaboration with the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), partners with the Hassenfeld Child Health Innovation Institute to foster a research driven approach to improving early childhood health to support the third grade reading goal. Rhode Island can capitalize on its small geography, high-level interagency coordination efforts (e.g., Children's Cabinet), and research strengths (e.g., Brown University and University of Rhode Island) to understand and address the causes of poor outcomes, and improve the health and education outcomes for children. RIDOH supports the following areas of work: - Investing in Knowledge: Hassenfeld Birth Cohort Study funded by Hassenfeld Foundation: This project serves as a pilot for collecting, analyzing, and evaluating data associated with this prenatal, maternal and child health population. Doing so will provide the state with lessons learned for any other related projects or potential scale-ups of existing projects. - Investing in Practice: Working Across Sectors to Accelerate the Delivery of Evidence-Based Programs: To accelerate near-term implementation of action steps, RIDOH dedicates efforts and energy to address already known recommendations within and between existing child- and family-serving programs. Engage community members, CHWs, and consumers in all areas of program, policy, and systems change RIDOH has engaged community members, CHWs and consumers in all program areas, policy-making and systems change in the following ways: Commission for Health Advocacy and Equity: RIDOH, Health Equity Institute convenes the Commission for Health Advocacy and Equity (CHAE). The CHAE is a legislatively mandated commission created to address the social determinants of health and eliminate health disparities. The CHAE membership reflects the diversity of RI, including individuals from or representing racial / ethnic minorities (Latino, Native American, and Black), persons with disabilities, LGBTTQQ, and people with limited English proficiency. Members also represent a variety of disciplines including consumers/residents, academia, housing, substance use, advocacy, medicine, public health, business, child welfare, local government, community development, planning, commerce, transportation, and social services. The Commission is required to complete a Disparities Impact and Evaluation legislative report every two years. The first report was published in January 2015 and it identifies disparities in 5 areas (nutrition and physical activity, asthma, infant mortality, chronic illnesses and oral health) that needed to be addressed. In addition to the five focus areas, the report identifies global recommendations for addressing health disparities in RI. The second report released in December 2017, establishes definitions of equity terminology including health, health equity, determinants of health, and health disparities and identified 2 priority areas that the Commission's work will focus on for the next two years. These priority areas are (1) increase minimum wage to $15 per hour, and (2) increase high school graduation rates. The Commission actively engages with community organizations, members of the public, and legislators to impact these two priority areas. The third report was published in January 2020 and highlights RI's Statewide Health Equity Indicators. This report provides data related to these measures to help educate the Rhode Island General Assembly, State agencies, and partner organizations on health inequities in Rhode Island. For each measure, the report also includes examples of programs and policies in Rhode Island and across the country that are showing promise for reducing inequities. During the 2020 pandemic, CHAE members participated on the State's Equity Council to ensure equitable access to both COVID-19 testing and vaccine allocations. CHAE also issued a letter to the Governor in May 2020 sharing their urgent concerns from the community and recommendations pertaining to racial equity and health justice during the current COVID-19 crisis. Peer Resource Specialists: Peer Resource Specialists are culturally diverse family members with experience accessing MCH services and are assigned to various RIDOH programs based on the program's need for parent and consumer participation. Peer resource specialists are full partners in policymaking, outreach, and program quality assurance and evaluation. During the last reporting period, the RIDOH contracted with the RI Parent Information Network (RIPIN) to employ 16 Peer Resource Specialists (PRS) in various programs throughout the Department. The PRS were employed in programs including WIC, Immunization, Birth Defects, Diabetes Prevention, Wise Woman, Integrated Chronic Disease, Health Communications, Family Visiting, EDHI, Emergency Preparedness, and Special Needs. They served as a partner in policymaking, outreach, and program quality assurance/evaluation. All staff employed by the contracted agency is part of an apprentice program to achieve Community Health Worker (CHW) certification or recertification. Training is a total of 70 hours for new CHW's with 20 hours for recertification. The training covers topics relevant to the domains identified by the RI Certification Board including a minimum of 3 hours in ethics. During the next reporting period, the RIDOH will continue to support the employment of existing and new Peer Resource Specialists to provide culturally diverse family members with experience accessing MCH services throughout the Department, which ensures the parent and consumer voice at the program level. Parent Leadership Initiatives: A main tenant of the MCH Program is supporting, empowering, training, hiring, and promoting parents and family partners at all levels of decision making, policy development, service provision, and community development. RIDOH partners with the RI Parent Information Network, Parent Support Network, Sherlock Center on Disabilities (RI's UCEDD), the Autism Project of RI, and other disease specific family organizations. Parent leaders are cultivated and supported to lead policy initiatives, make systems improvements, and champion principles of parent-professional partnerships. Parent support groups are organized throughout the state. RIDOH has contracted with RIPIN (Family Voices) to maintain a calendar of support groups based on topic, age, and language. Through the Family Voices Leadership Team, RIDOH has addressed system barriers and developed a parent policy team to provide peer-to-peer support in addressing statewide policy, especially health reform. Throughout RI over 1850 parents have been trained in navigating the special needs service delivery system such as basic rights, college success for students with disabilities, options for medical assistance, and transition planning. RI Asthma Control Program: The RI Asthma Control Program (RIACP) is working closely with families and seeking to develop family leadership in multiple areas including but not limited to: improving indoor air quality at home and in schools asthma and chronic disease self-management skills healthy housing policies and training and support for development of advocacy skills. In February of 2021, with the help of several key stakeholders across sectors, RIACP developed an updated Asthma Strategic Plan for the state of Rhode Island. The new strategic plan focuses on four priority areas, including: 1) housing, 2) education and schools, 3) healthcare/systems, and 4) air quality and transportation. Stakeholder Engagement in the Health Equity Zones (HEZ): Each of the 11 funded Health Equity Zones has a lead organization (local government or local non-profit entity) that acts as a backbone on behalf of a collaborative of key community stakeholders and residents in the designated geographic area. One of the requirements of HEZ funding is to conduct authentic and in-depth stakeholder and resident engagement to ensure that individuals who are experiencing poor health outcomes and health disparities are represented and are included in HEZ decision-making and oversight efforts. Youth Resource Specialists: Since 2014, the Health Equity Institute has invested in hiring and supporting Youth Resource Specialists. Their input into the transition process and generation of self-determination resources has been invaluable. Youth Resource Specialists on the YAC Advisory participate as a team in the RIDOH annual youth conference opening/volunteer activities, represent RI at national youth forums, and promote inclusion in RI's youth serving organizations. In 2019, youth resource specialists led a monthly Youth Advisory Council where an average of 35 students with disabilities served as advisors to RIDOH programs and policies presented at the national AMCHP Conference; and presented at the Turn Up Rhode Island Conference featuring career exploration for 300 students of color. Unfortunately, youth conferences expected to take place in the Spring of 2020 were cancelled due to COVID-19. During the last Title V reporting period, the YAC served fifteen (15) members who met monthly from September 2020 through May 2021 in the virtual environment to address topics including: strengths assessing, stress reduction, health equity, emergency preparedness, and voting rights. The YAC also has a significant role in the RI Department of Health Programs to provide youth voice on health/wellness messaging and the development of strategic plans. The YAC meeting structure also provides a means for members to connect with their peers. As a group, the YAC wrote a beautiful poem, It's OK not to be OK, describing the difficulties of the past year. The ease of taking part in remote meetings appealed to youth and we had a banner recruiting year with 6 new members. Through a contract with several professional entities, the YAC also provided needed supports relevant to the COVID pandemic including a Coping with Covid series that was open to the public. This workshop series showcased strategies on how to incorporate coping skills into daily life and how to utilize tools to help deal with stress/life changes. The YAC also facilitated a capacity building training series on running remote meetings for youth and young adults. These Zoom Boot Camps taught community serving organizations how to reach youth and keep them engaged through remote connections. The plan for the 2021/2022 reporting period includes continuing a remote meeting option along with in- person meetings (when resumed) to accommodate the many youths with transportation challenges. The planned agenda for this period will include professional development/ leadership training, social/emotional/resilience workshops, community youth engagement opportunities, and RIDOH Program support activities. Continue to implement & support the Health Equity Zone (HEZ) Initiative. RI's Health Equity Zone initiative is an innovative, place-based approach that brings communities together to build the infrastructure needed to achieve system and policy changes at the local and statewide levels. With a mission to \"encourage and equip neighbors and community partners to collaborate to create healthy places for people to live, learn, work, and play\", eleven Health Equity Zones directed approximately $5 million in public health funding, during the reporting period, towards community-led projects, increasing the impact of efforts to build healthier and more resilient communities. HEZs are contiguous geographic areas that are small enough to have a significant impact on improving health outcomes, reducing health disparities and improving the social and environmental conditions of the neighborhood, yet large enough to impact a significant number of people. HEZs can be defined by political boundaries (e.g., cities, wards) or by less defined boundaries (e.g., neighborhoods). The geographically defined HEZ community must have a target population of at least 5,000 people, demonstrate economic disadvantage, and demonstrate poor health outcomes. The HEZ are administered by a \"Backbone Agency\" which may be a municipality or a public not-for-profit community-based organization which coordinates the efforts of a HEZ Collaborative to achieve project goals. Existing Health Equity Zone Collaboratives include residents, diverse community-based organizations, youth-serving organizations, educators, business leaders, health professionals, transportation experts, and people in many other fields who come together to address the most pressing health concerns in their neighborhoods. Through a collaborative, community-led process, each Health Equity Zone conducts a needs assessment and implements a data-driven plan of action to address the unique social, economic, and environmental factors that are preventing people from reaching their optimal health. The HEZ approach recognizes that communities have different needs and assets to build upon. By aligning strategic investments with existing resources across sectors, each community can address their unique needs, reduce disparities, and stimulate economic growth. Listed below is a summary description of efforts undertaken by each HEZ to improve maternal and child health outcomes in their communities. Additional projects have also been included in specific domain reports as well. Bristol: In the Bristol Health Equity Zone, an Engagement Navigator at Mt. Hope High School offered one-on-one counseling to students with immediate need for a variety of support services, including housing resources, food access, and more. This position offers students and families immediate assistance, prescreening services, and referrals to a variety of wrap around programs. The long-term goal of this effort is to decrease the number of students and families accessing emergency rooms for mental health support services. The new student advocate continued this work and also worked with a group of students to implement the Change Direction campaign in Mt. Hope High School. This group morphed into a student union group that worked on additional activities around equity and inclusion. Bristol HEZ continued supporting the Parents As Teachers program, which offers free family visiting to any family with a child between prenatal and kindergarten entry. This program provided knowledge for parents regarding age-appropriate skills and activities to promote school readiness, and increased families' connections to various education, employment, family, and physical and mental health resources in the community. Last year, 54 families, including 68 children, received a total of 335 visits, and 9 group sessions were offered. The Parents As Teachers program has remained a strong program in Bristol and was able to grow through HEZ funding, continuing to sustain its high enrollment rates. A group of residents and community stakeholders, including representatives from the School Department, the Bristol Police Department, Bayside YMCA, Roger Williams University, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, and more, meet monthly toward a community-wide suicide prevention plan. This group initiated the Kindness Rocks campaign to spread kindness and compassion and increase the sense of community connectedness. Accomplishments include getting signage on Mount Hope Bridge, conducting mental health forums, and suicide prevention trainings in coordination with American Foundation of Suicide Prevention. Additionally, in this reporting year, they worked with faculty and students who developed a policy brief around barriers on RI bridges. They presented this brief to their working group and BHEZ distributed it to Representatives Susan Donovan and Joseph Solomon, both of whom were instrumental in introducing legislation this year. The Personal Health and Mental wellness working group continues to work on the Bristol Kindness Project - this reporting year, they focused on getting happy mail (over 1,300 letters) and on Don't Give up Signs in the community. BHEZ also participated on the Bristol Warren Regional School District's Wellness Committee to provide input on wellness activities within the school. Additionally, BHEZ continues to be a part of coordinating the Bristol-Warren Thrive by Five and Beyond. The group's mission is to maintain a coordinated network of collaborating partners to support families in their efforts to help children reach their full potential. Throughout the reporting year, the group provided professional development for the group to help them be able to provide services to families and children in the community. Central Providence: In 2019, the Olneyville Health Equity Zone expanded to additional adjacent neighborhoods in Providence to create the Central Providence Health Equity Zone. With the addition of new areas of the community, the Central Providence HEZ conducted a needs assessment in those areas to determine what the HEZs action plan should be for those neighborhoods. Lack of affordable childcare was identified as a community need, and the HEZ developed a plan for establishing a new resident-led childcare center and for improving existing childcare centers in the area. The Central Providence HEZ's main focus was on economic opportunity, and those efforts included the development of internship opportunities for teens, and a computer science skill-building program for middle school girls. The HEZ also used community health workers to connect residents to social services and to keep a pulse on the needs of the community. Community Health Workers also worked with families to increase enrollment in Family Home Visiting programs. The CP HEZ's CHWs have been an integral part of their response to COVID-19, by supporting efficient communication of residents' needs to the HEZ, which was then able to leverage its relationship with RIDOH and other agencies to direct resources to families with urgent needs during COVID-19. In 2019 the Central Providence HEZ, specifically collaborative member organizations Federal Hill House and The Autism Project, carried out programming to support children and their families. Federal Hill House developed playground extension projects, supported a First Providence Talks Extension (PTE) group that was designed to build parental behaviors that promote early childhood language and literacy, and promoted the Olyneyville community's Multi-Cultural Festival, which saw over 500 attendees. The Autism Project consulted local agencies to support children and families, as well as offered 10 hours of Conscious Discipline training for parents and caregivers, presented in both English and Spanish. In 2020, the Central Providence HEZ was awarded funding to support a Family Navigator to provide navigation services to parents and families in the HEZ community, working with a total of 161 families. Family navigation services provided through PDG funding, supporting families across the HEZ community. East Providence: The East Providence HEZ conducted a comprehensive community assessment in the 2019-2020 year, which included a youth focused survey. The youth survey was distributed to youth at the East Providence Boys and Girls Club and EBCAP's Youth Center. The response rate from the community needs assessment totaled 494, representing both youth and adult community members. Based on the findings from the EP HEZ Community Needs Assessment, the HEZ created five preliminary action areas, one of which being Supporting Health & Wellness Across the Lifespan. This focus area was addressed by hiring a Family Navigator to engage families with young children/expectant families to participate in the array of evidence-based maternal/early childhood home visiting programs, and to support families to secure the social and health resources they need. Newport: In addition to continuing to support ongoing maternal and child health work throughout their community, the Newport HEZ began focusing on key target populations most in need of health equity work. For example, they began working with community partners and healthcare providers to improve healthcare access and improve healthcare experiences for LGBTQ+ teens. The Newport HEZ also focused intensively on racial equity and racial justice. One of the Newport HEZ's leading priorities was to eliminate disparities in Black maternal and child health outcomes. In efforts to improve racial equity, the HEZ participated in and hosted several racial equity trainings throughout the reporting year, reaching hundreds of attendees in the Newport community and beyond. The Newport HEZ conducted all their work through a resident-centered, racial justice lens. The Newport HEZ partner Conexion Latina provided rent relief and gift-cards to support families in accessing basic necessities. Conexion Latina supported 27 families who were ineligible for state assistance with $500 in rental assistance. Conexion Latina also distributed gift cards of $50 each to families who expressed needing support in terms of basic necessities, hygeine items, and food. Several of Newport HEZ's workgroups incorporated youth voice and needs into their action plans. The LGBTQ+ Health Working Group partnered with Child & Family, a social service provider in Newport County. This workgroup aimed to support healthcare facilities in earning the designation as LGBTQ+ safe spaces, thus increasing the safety and wellbeing of LGBTQ+ youth. Newport HEZ's Arts and Culture Working Group partnered with the Newport Youth Chorus and Newport Public Schools to engage young people in coordinating public art and other cultural activities in Newport. Pawtucket/Central Falls: The Childhood Lead Action Project (CLAP) continued to provide lead poisoning prevention and education to the Pawtucket and Central Falls communities. CLAP facilitated five lead poisoning prevention workshops at local schools. The HEZ's partnership with CLAP has contributed to achieving a decrease in childhood lead poisoning in Pawtucket, and the HEZ continued to support work to decrease childhood lead poisoning throughout the community. The Pawtucket Central Falls HEZ developed an Opioid Action Plan, which included plans for substance use education for youth, and the creation of positive social opportunities and employment opportunities for youth and young adults. The plan was informed by the 2019 Opioid needs assessment. Target population included young adults, families with a loved one who has a substance use disorder, and pregnant women and mothers with substance use disorder (or in recovery). Needs assessment participants also included staff of organizations in the community who work with young adults or people with a substance use disorder. Secondary data from RIDOH and law enforcement was also used to identify needs. The PCF HEZ's substance use education programs reached over 216 students at local schools in 2020. In a post-presentation survey of those students, 91% reported that the presentation helped them understand how opioids affect the body, and 92% reported feeling very or somewhat confident that they would be able to help someone in the case of an overdose. The PCF HEZ's substance use education programs reached over 216 students at local schools in 2020. PCF HEZ continued to leverage the expertise of state and community stakeholders and remain flexible in their approach as they empower youth in guiding the work. The PCF HEZ identified youth engagement as a priority focus. Under this focus area many priorities were addressed through the lens of youth's perspective and voice and choice. To that end intentional opportunities for youth leadership and advancement were prioritized. Through their partnership with the Boys and Girls Club, the PCF HEZ engaged families and youth in a family swim program, anti-bullying and conflict resolution programming, and fitness and wellness classes. The Boys and Girls Club also helped serve local families with groceries, gift cards, and activities for youth during COVID-19. Another HEZ partner, Progreso Latino, provided individuals with birth control options and information regarding prenatal and postnatal care. PCF HEZ held a number of financial training and home education opportunities in collaboration with Pawtucket Central Falls Development ( PCFD). HEZ residents participated in Tenant/Landlord and Homebuyer classes. Classes incorporated information regarding asthma risks and preventions. In response to COVID-19, education classes transitioned into virtual sessions, which allowed PCF HEZ to continue facilitating education and training. PCF HEZ worked closely with PCFD to make changes in their program in response to COVID-19 and to meet the needs of their residents. Staff did outreach to their tenants, ensuring they had information regarding COVID-19, rental and other available assistance. The PCF HEZ worked with GroundWorks RI to build community resilience to climate change. Youth were employed and trained on how to grow their own food at SCLT's Galego Court farm in Pawtucket, how to process and cook their food at Harvest Kitchen, and how to engage residents and gather data regarding climate resilient mitigation strategies with GroundWorks RI. The partnership program between SCLT, Harvest Kitchen, and GroundWorks RI ran successfully with online and new safety protocols. SCLT has continued to train garden leaders and supported a resident lead apiary project in Pawtucket. PCF HEZ identified parents who were recruited for the Nurturing Parent Program that targeted all families at risk for abuse and neglect from birth to age 18. PCF HEZ purchased multicultural classroom materials for Pawtucket and Central Falls classrooms. Classroom materials included items such as bilingual books, CDs, and dolls and clothing representing diverse nations around the world. Backpacks were filled with multicultural learning materials (similar to the classroom materials) and were also purchased to foster the home-school connection. Additionally, to support the materials, 60 hours of mentor coaching was provided to teaching teams. It is approximated that 216 children and their families were impacted by this program. PCF HEZ continued to address the social determinants of health and the causative relationship that hinders access to care. One of the impacted areas was in addressing quality learning for English Learning preschoolers as well as family engagement in children's learning. Fifty-three percent of children met or exceeded expectations in language from winter to spring and 50% more in mathematics. Progreso Latino also provided clients with information on COVID testing, birth control options, and information regarding prenatal, and post-natal care, including \"Am I Ready to be a Mom?\" and \"Am I Ready to be a Dad?\" brochures. These brochures (distributed in either English or Spanish) are educational documents focused on promoting preconception, prenatal, and post-natal care. A HEZ partner, the YMCA, became an important Beat COVID partner providing staffing for flyer distribution regarding testing. The YMCA outreach team provided hundreds of hours of canvassing and outreach to Pawtucket and Central Falls, focusing on COVID hotspots as identified by RIDOH during the reporting timeframe. Outreach staff (including the Family Support Team with interns; multilingual Community Health Workers and outreach staff; and city stakeholders) informed COVID response efforts. The HEZ distributed masks to PCF organizations and to the city for large give away and prevention events, hundreds of thousands of masks and meals were distributed. In addition, 944 supply kits with food and PPE were tailored to the Cape Verdean community. The HEZ was able to quickly identify needs and partners to address community needs. In all, 2,000 individuals were assisted with COVID prevention, testing, or how to quarantine/isolate during this portion of the pandemic. Early on, HEZ partners supported testing sites and 13,000 tests were given. Washington County: Maternal and child health was a primary focus of South County Health Bodies Healthy Minds (HBHM), which served as the backbone for the Washington County Health Equity Zone. HBHM implemented 5-2-1-0 to prevent childhood obesity and promote healthy habits, by encouraging families to be more physically active and eat healthier, while engaging community partners to create healthier environments for children. The 5-2-1-0 program promotes eating 5 fruits and vegetables, engaging in no more than 2 hours of recreational screen time, getting 1 hour of exercise, and drinking 0 sugary drinks per day. The Washington County HEZ reached over 19,000 children and adolescents with their 5-2-1-0 programming. Forty-six 5-2-1-0-related strategies were implemented in schools, child care centers, and other organizations. Five summer camps incorporated 5-2-1-0 materials and/or activities into their curriculum. An estimated 16,986 youth and adults have been indirectly impacted by 5-2-1-0 this reporting year through the efforts made at the organizational and county-levels. Ten K-12 schools implemented policy, systems, or environmental changes including offering a new grab-n-go breakfast option, eliminating chocolate milk for breakfast, and starting advisory committees for students to work with food service providers to give input on school nutrition. Three Washington County schools have established student committees. In addition, policy, systems, and environmental (PSEs) have impacted an estimated 1,439 children. From an organizational standpoint, HBHM has made substantial progress in impacting their community, engaging 71 organizational partners, including 18 schools (K-12), 23 preschools, 8 health service organizations, and 22 afterschool programs, and provided 145 hours of technical assistance to organizations in their efforts to support healthy eating and physical activity. This included: Connected community partners with Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) to assist with needed COVID-related resources; supported Community Health Workers (CHWs) and the community members they serve to address food insecurity needs; provided school staff\u2014nurses and health and physical education teachers\u2014physical activity resources to engage children and families remotely; assisted 10 child care organizations fulfill a total of 17 NAPSACC^ goals; and disseminated 1,522 5-2-1-0 materials, including frisbees, water bottles, jump ropes, toolkits, and pedometers to increase awareness of, and support for engaging in healthy behaviors. HBHM organized and conducted an online school garden conference with local school garden experts, now posted on HBHM's YouTube channel; and partnered with Peace Dale Library to provide garden kits (accompanied by gently used books related to healthy habits) to children in the Champaign Heights neighborhood as well as South County YMCA and South Kingstown Parks & Recreation programs. Through Project LAUNCH (Linking Actions for Unmet Needs in Children's Health), the Washington County HEZ implemented 3 key prevention and promotion strategies : (1) conducted Incredible Beginnings training with 19 early care & education providers, including home visitors (2) partnered with schools and Head Start to conduct 4 Incredible Years Parenting groups (to promote family strengthening and positive parenting skills), and (3) integrated behavioral health services into primary care settings by providing mental health consultation in 4 small pediatric practices. In all, 337 children received developmental screenings, and 101 children received mental health consultations through Project LAUNCH. The Washington County HEZ published Healthy Habits/recipe book, and distributed hard copies and electronic versions throughout the county, and created the Feeding Toddlers Info Sheet for local pediatricians/PCPs to use with families in their practices. In addition, water bottle filling stations were installed in Narragansett schools, the HEZ provided support for the state passage of sweetened beverage tax, supported the Bradford-on-the-lane food pantry, and the Davisville hangouts, which provided an online middle school community to support youth connections during the COVID-19 lockdown. HBHM recognized the need to continue wide-scale mental health literacy training with Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) and the QPR ( Question, Persuade, Refer) with the national goal of attaining 1:10 trained in MHFA. Subsequent to goal and implementation, it was evaluated that 356 people were MHFA trained. 92 of the 356 individuals trained are youth. HBHM recognized how death by suicide; particularly among youth was devastating their community. An innovative strategy employed was outreach and support through QPR suicide prevention codes which launched in October 2020. Washington County HEZ was the first in Rhode Island to launch this initiative. There are over 54 signs county wide and over 800 unique devices scanned. 709 people were trained in QPR suicide prevention. Signs were strategically placed county-wide provide access to free mental health & suicide prevention supports. West Elmwood: In July 2020 the West Elmwood 02907 HEZ received PDG funds to provide Families Thrive programming through the Genesis Center and Providence Community Library. They also were able to support a Family Navigator, who would eventually assist 26 people by providing systems navigation support, including support in applying to the COVID-19 Relief Fund. West Warwick: West Warwick Public Schools Implemented a 3-tier trauma-informed high school initiative and trained teachers and staff throughout the school department. Trauma informed care was an important focus of the HEZ. West Warwick is a trauma informed community with trauma informed schools. The HEZ in association with the partner agencies focused on families. Parents were worried how the social isolation caused by the pandemic would affect their children's ability to successfully interact when they re-started school. A Preschool Development Grant (PDG) award was used to bring together partner agencies (School Department, Thrive, and the YMCA) to prepare young children for kindergarten in the fall, through the \"Play and Thrive\" program. West Warwick has the highest rate of foster and kinship care in the state, which led a West Warwick resident and HEZ ambassador to establish the Grands Flourish program to support the experience of grandparents raising grandchildren due to the opioid epidemic and other trauma. Grands Flourish piloted a peer-to-peer grandparent support and resource group at the West Warwick HEZ Hub, and West Bay CAP implemented a part-time case manager solely dedicated to supporting grandparents raising grandchildren in West Warwick. Throughout the reporting year, the West Warwick HEZ continued to support these efforts and others to support families with children impacted by substance use. Woonsocket: Teen Health continued to be a key focus area of the Woonsocket HEZ. Throughout the reporting year. The HEZ continued to support a Family Planner and Sexuality Educator in Woonsocket High School and continued to implement an inclusive, medically accurate, comprehensive, and evidence-based health curriculum for high school students. Since baseline in 2014, the HEZ's work has contributed to a 30% reduction in birth to teens in Woonsocket. Woonsocket HEZ continued to engage community partners in building youth leadership by supporting an overnight youth leadership retreat with the Woonsocket Alliance to Champion Health. During the 2020 State fiscal year, Woonsocket HEZ collaborative organizations were awarded PDG funding to facilitate Circle of Security training as well as Parents as Teachers (PAT) programming. As a result of the Circle of Security training, 9 trainers were able to be certified to facilitate the training. COVID-19 HEZ Response: Given the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated effects on the residents of Rhode Island beginning in March of 2020, the focus of the HEZs turned to responding to the arising acute needs that emerged in communities as a result of the pandemic. The Health Equity Zones worked to rapidly identify and respond to emergent needs in their community while continuing their HEZ work and achieving progress toward their goals. The HEZs played a critical role in response efforts, serving as a liaison between the community and the Department of Health, and coordinating resources and services at the community level.\" And the state of Rhode Island leveraged the HEZs and capacity to address the disparate impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Specifically, the HEZs coordinated food delivery, distribution of PPE, and social and educational supports for families with children. During the reporting timeframe, HEZ COVID-19 responses outreached to about 16,000 Rhode Islanders, served over 14,000 residents through Community Health Workers and Community Outreach Specialists, distributed nearly a million masks and nearly 200,000 meals to residents. The following summary outlines many of the accomplishments HEZS have made regarding the COVID-19 response both collectively and individually, and in that way, advanced Maternal and Child Health from October 1, 2019-September 30, 2020. Highlights are provided along with COVID-19 HEZ response data within the associated time period (data included were collected from June through September 2020). - HEZs continued to utilize community health workers to connect community members to social services and residents, and to keep a pulse on the needs of the community. - CHWs worked with families to increase enrollment in Family Home Visiting programs. - CHWs provided interpretation services and assisted families in navigating resources for COVID-19 related Q&I. - All the HEZs conducted comprehensive community needs assessments, focusing largely on MCH populations (families, women, youth, and teens). - All HEZs developed an action plan to address the identified community needs, including MCH populations. - HEZs collectively provided Basic Needs Services throughout the COVID-19 pandemic (see total statistics for the time period below), such as: - Provided PPE (masks), cleaning supplies, information, education, and support - Assistance with unemployment, SNAP and other assistance applications - Support for local food banks: restocking with food and PPE - Delivered meals and culturally relevant food products - \"Be Safe Kits\" - fresh produce (bread, eggs, vegetables), cleaning supplies, face masks, hand sanitizer - Emergency resource gift cards, food assistance, and personal care items - Home-safe programs: providing rental assistance, cash assistance to support housing stability - Utility assistance - Thanksgiving and holiday baskets - Transportation assistance - Assistance getting medication to individuals in need - In addition, individual HEZs continued to serve their communities throughout the pandemic and to meet their work goals that aligned with their community needs assessments. Priority: Improve Mental/Behavioral Health Increase the number of programs implemented in Rhode Island that support healthy social/emotional development and address behavioral health issues. RIDOH is supporting a number of program that support healthy social/emotional development and address behavioral health issues including: Maternal Psychiatry Resource Network (MomsPRN): At the end of 2018, the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) was one of seven states awarded a 5-year Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) grant to implement teleconsultant line to help obstetrical, adult primary care, pediatric, and psychiatric providers treating pregnant and postpartum patients screen and manage behavioral health disorders. To achieve this end, the RIDOH partnered with the Center for Women's Behavioral Health at Women and Infants Hospital (CWBH) to implement the teleconsultation line and the Care Transformation Collaborative of Rhode Island (CTC) to provide intensive quality improvement coaching about behavioral health screening, treatment, and referral to contracted prenatal care practices. The RI MomsPRN teleconsultation line is staffed by perinatal experts at the CWBH and is modeled after Rhode Island's successful Pediatric Psychiatry Resource Network (PediPRN) program (see Child domain for more information). The goal of the RI MomsPRN psychiatry teleconsultation line is to empower providers in effectively managing their perinatal patients' behavioral health and substance use concerns, by initially providing treatment guidance from RI MomsPRN perinatal psychiatric specialists, and/or offering information and referral for additional supports and services in their patients' geographic area. In addition to providing perinatal behavioral health teleconsultation and practice transformation services for healthcare providers, the RI MomsPRN program also collaborated with RIDOH's Family Home Visiting Program and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program to create, distribute, and promote a public service campaign about perinatal depression and anxiety and the importance of seeking help by connecting with a healthcare provider. The 30 second spot featured a patient testimonial and was aired on a local news station in June 2020. To help further amplify this campaign, the RIDOH created a new mental health resource page for new moms and featured the campaign on its various digital platforms. During this reporting period (October 2019 - September 2020), the RI MomsPRN teleconsultation line fielded 346 teleconsultation calls, with 55 coming directly from perinatal patients and the remaining 291 calls coming from 182 unique providers (39 behavioral health clinicians, 38 OBGYNs, 19 family visitors, 18 midwives, 15 nurse practitioners, 13 social workers, 11 pediatricians, 10 family physicians, 6 residents, 2 internal medicine/general practice physicians, and 11 others). In total, 328 women (including 103 pregnant women) were helped because their provider contacted the RI MomsPRN teleconsultation line during this reporting period. These race (1% American Indian or Alaska Native (2), 2% Asian (7), 10% Black or African American (31), 1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (4), 49% White (162), 9% multiple race/other (29), or 28% unknown (93)), - ethnicity (20% Hispanic/Latinx (65), 54% non-Hispanic/Latinx (178), or 26% unknown (85)), - insurance coverage (50% Medicaid (164), 40% commercial (133), 4% other (13), <1% uninsured (1), or 5% unknown (17)), - primary language spoken (English, Spanish, and Chinese), - reported provisional behavioral health diagnosis by provider, with 39% of calls involving depression (201), 30% involving anxiety (154), 6% involving PTSD (33), 5% involving bipolar disorder (28), 5% involving SUD (24), 4% involving ADHD (19), 3% involving complicated grief (14), and 5% involving other disorders (29), (psychotic disorder (7), personality disorder (6), eating disorder (5), OCD (4), among others (7)), and 3% involving no provisional diagnosis (17), and - reported psychiatric prescriptions by provider, with 42% of calls involving patients taking psychiatric medication(s) (137 in total, with 133 for mental health and 4 for SUD). Also, during this time, the RI MomsPRN program was able to launch its first perinatal behavioral health quality improvement learning collaborative through a statewide call for applications. After applications were scored and reviewed by a selection committee, 4 prenatal care practices (Care New England Medical Group-Women's Care, Lifespan Physician Group OBGYN Associates-Women's Medicine Collaborative, South County Health-Center for Women's Health, and WIH Obstetrics and Gynecology Care Center) were invited to participate. Taken together, these four practices manage 36% (5,903) of all the estimated perinatal patients in RI (16,235). Each practice formed a quality improvement team that included a practice champion, a practice leader, and an IT/EHR staff member. The teams met monthly with CTC practice transformation experts, attended joint learning sessions, and were welcome to call the teleconsultation line for patient specific clinical advisement. In exchange for providing cumulative de-identified quarterly screening data, updating and finalizing behavioral health Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) forms, and completing practice- and provider-level baseline and follow-up self-efficacy surveys from RIDOH and HRSA, practices were eligible to receive practice payments. During this reporting period, cumulative de-duplicated screening data from January through August 2020 was reported, which showed that 59% (2,815) of attributed perinatal patients were screened for depression, 27% (1,306) were screened for substance use disorder, and 25% (1,168) were screened for anxiety at least once using a validated instrument. Practices had until the end of 2020 to increase those percentages further. Finalized aggregate performance period data of this first learning cohort (January 2020-December 2020), showed 65% (3,823) of attributed perinatal patients were screened for depression, 36% (2,116) were screened for substance use disorder, and 30% (1,754) were screened for anxiety. In addition to providing perinatal behavioral health teleconsultation and practice transformation services, during this reporting period the RI MomsPRN program also engaged with 1,560 providers through various outreach (35) and professional education (16) sessions that included information about perinatal behavioral health and available program services. RI MomsPRN clinical staff also supported five family visiting agencies that were participating in a HRSA Home Visiting Collaborative Improvement and Innovation Network (HV CoIIN) maternal depression continuous quality improvement initiative. During this reporting period, 28 staff at 5 home visiting agencies/programs were able to call the line for resource and referral support and/or attend relevant outreach/professional education sessions hosted by RI MomsPRN program staff to support their maternal depression quality improvement work. In total, 19 staff members (68% of staff participating in HV CoIIN) called the line for resource/referral support and 5 outreach/professional education sessions were held by RI MomsPRN staff during this reporting period. Finally, the RI MomsPRN Program collaborated with the RIDOH's Family Visiting Program and the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) Program to create, distribute, and promote a public service campaign about perinatal depression and anxiety and the importance of seeking help by connecting with a healthcare provider. The 30 second spot featured a patient testimonial and was aired 42 times on a local news station in June 2020. It reached 48,846 individuals aged 25-54 residing in RI and Bristol County Massachusetts (9.9% of that targeted demo). To further support this campaign, the RIDOH created a perinatal mental health webpage that was promoted with this news partnership and regularly on the RIDOH homepage and social media channels, which resulted in 458 page views during this reporting period. Emotional Regulation Intervention Project: The Rhode Island Department of Health Violence and Injury Prevention Program, in conjunction with the Rhode Island Student Assistance Program (SAP), aims to provide a wide range of prevention and early intervention services to high-risk adolescents. The intervention will be implemented by master's level counselors who will provide a Prevention Education Series (PES) involving individual and group counseling for students enrolled. It will refer to community-based social services and mental health agencies. The intervention was piloted during the '17-'18 school year. During the pilot, SAP counselors were trained in Project TRAC, a developmentally tailored emotion regulation training program designed for middle school students. The focus of the program is to help students 1) become aware of the connection between emotions and behaviors (especially risk behaviors), 2) improve recognition of when one is having a strong emotion, and 3) learn strategies for managing emotions in moments when they are making decisions. The 2018 Title V MCH Venture Capital Funding allowed the Violence and Injury Prevention Program (VIPP) to scale up the implementation of the Emotional Regulation Intervention Project from two to five schools. During the '18-'19 school year the SAP hosted a two-day emotional regulation intervention training for five counselors across five Rhode Island school districts, both returning and new, who showed interest in the Emotional Regulation Intervention Project. The number of students who participated varied between three to eight students per group. The Emotional Regulation Intervention Project served a total of over 50 students, but the pre- and post-surveys were only completed by students who received parental approval before the start of the workshop. The evaluator analyzed the pre/post survey data and developed a report in September 2019. In an effort to sustain the intervention project, the VIPP will work with the emotional regulation consultant to adapt the 12-session workshop into strategies that can be implemented by teachers in the classroom. In addition, the VIPP was able to obtain additional funding through the Rape Prevention Education grant to implement seven workshops in the 19-20 school year. The RISAS program was able to implement the Emotional Regulation Program in Westerly, North Kingston, Johnston, Pawtucket, Barrington, Chariho, and Burrillville in the '19-'20 school year. The Program was interrupted by COVID-19, however, and not all seven schools were able to complete the 12 sessions. Once schools went to a virtual platform RISAS counselors were not able to assemble the students to complete the sessions. No schools were able to complete the evaluation component, which includes a pre survey, post survey and a 1-month survey. Mental Health Consultation within early care and education: Through a partnership with DHS, child focused mental health consultation is available statewide. RIDOH is currently working with DHS to sustain its program focused mental health consultation to childcare as well. In 2020, several mental health professionals from Bradley Early Childhood Research Center, who are also early childhood mental health consultants, developed and delivered training on how to become a child care mental health consultant with the goal of expanding the capacity of the system overall. Offer training to support providers who may be caring for families who may be experiencing toxic stress: RI continued to make progress toward developing systems and strategies of recognition and response for families with young children who are experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, toxic stress and/or trauma. Over the past year RI focused on continuing to support First Connections home visiting to implement the Experience Screen to identify Toxic Stress. RI also focused on offering training to providers who are caring for children and families experiencing toxic Stress and/or trauma. RI is conducting ongoing research with the Experience Screen to ascertain if risk for Toxic Stress can be determined at birth. RIDOH will also continue to focus efforts around ensuring that the highest risk children and their families are linked to comprehensive services. Additionally, RI will pursue targeted funding streams to increase the capacity to mitigate toxic stress. RIDOH will continue to offer training to groups of multi-disciplinary providers on caring for children and families who experience toxic stress and/or trauma. Three training sessions are planned for the coming year. Develop and implement a model of mental health consultation to the Family Visiting Program: The Family Home Visiting Program will continue to support its 14 family visiting agencies with access to mental health consultation and similar supportive resources. With support from national experts, TA and local mental health consultants, RI has developed a tiered framework to support mental health consultation within family visiting so that family visitors, supervisors and program managers have levels of support while working with complicated families. Two levels provide for mental health consultation to family visitors and to families. The Family Home Visiting Program provided each family home visiting agency with dedicated funding in the agency's contract for the past few years. That funding may be used for mental health consultation and supportive services. The Family Visiting Program will continue to provide that dedicated funding in future contracts. There is also funding in the Preschool Development Block grant, beginning in Fall 2020, to support mental health consultation. In addition to providing funding to each family home visiting agency, the Family Home Visiting Program has partnered with the RI Association for Infant Mental Health (RIAIMH) to provide additional support to the family home visiting workforce. The Family Home Visiting Program works with RIAIMH on training and support related to infant mental health. The Family Home Visiting Program is also supporting family visiting staff by funding home visitors engaged in the process of Endorsement for Culturally Sensitive, Relationship-Focused Practice Promoting Infant Mental Health\u00ae (RI-IMHEndorsement\u00ae). This endorsement process ensures that family home visiting staff have the competencies and skills to support the parent-child relationship and promote positive parenting practices that address the needs of infants. The family home visiting program has worked with training providers of the reflective practice and supervision to align their training curriculum with the competencies for Endorsement so that their reflection practice and supervision training and group sessions support a family visitor that is working on Endorsement. Implement suicide prevention programs: The Rhode Island Youth Suicide Prevention Project (RIYSPP) works with a broad range of partners to implement a combination of strategies aligned with the 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention that are focused on lowering youth (10-24) suicide death and attempt rates. The three primary interventions associated with this project are: - Training youth and adults across the state in evidence-based gatekeeper training programs, - Training counselors/school crisis team members from schools across the state in a novel streamlined crisis evaluation assessment tool/protocol and referring them to clinicians (via the Kids' Link line at Bradley Hospital) who can help them triage and connect students in crisis with a local mental health provider, and - Implementing RI's first systemic linkage of non-health organizations with mental health using various strategies in order to coordinate and share resources for the assessment, referral, treatment, and provision of follow-up care with wrap-around services for at risk youth, including sharing de-identified data. Also, the project maintains a statewide Youth Suicide Prevention Coalition with representation from all priority populations and funded/non-funded partners and works to promote suicide prevention principles to all Rhode Island residents. VIPP is currently working to rollout the SPI Youth Suicide Prevention work to every public-school district in the state. The VIPP has also implemented the Emotional Regulation program in one Health Equity Zone middle school (Westerly). Additionally, the VIPP has participated in the HRSA funded Collaborative Office Rounds grant, whereby the HEZ has received the funding and training is targeted to local pediatricians. Furthermore, the VIPP participates with the Bristol Health Equity Zone through their suicide prevention subcommittee. Other Programs/Projects Related to Mental/Behavioral Health Governor's Council on Behavioral Health The Governor's Council on Behavioral Health is the State of Rhode Island's behavioral health planning council. It was established by both federal and state law to review/evaluate the needs associated with Rhode Island's services for individuals with mental/behavioral health and substance use disorders. The RI Department of Health, Office of Special Needs participates on the Council which serves in an advisory capacity to the Governor and the General Assembly and has 18 Public Members. More than half of the members are required to be consumers of behavioral healthcare services, their family members, and advocates. During the last reporting period, the RI Department of Health, Office of Special Needs participated as a representative of the Department on the Governor's Commission on Behavioral Health. In this role, the perspective of the needs of children/youth with special health care needs and their families were brought forward to state agency and community stakeholder leadership. During the next reporting period, the RI Department of Health, Office of Special Needs will continue to participate as a member of the Governor's Council of Behavioral Health. In this capacity, the OSN will advocate for the needs of children and youth with mental/behavioral health diagnosis and their families to be met through a quality system of services and supports. Drug Overdose Prevention Program The mission of the Drug Overdose Prevention Program is to decrease drug overuse, misuse and abuse and to decrease nonfatal and fatal drug overdoses in RI. The PDO PfS Program educates prescribers and pharmacists on the responsible prescribing of opioids, connects people struggling with substance use disorder (SUD) to community health navigator services, evaluates public health policies relevant to drug overdose prevention, improves access to drug overdose data, and engages diverse stakeholders to facilitate multi-agency collaboration and partnerships. The Program works very closely with and supports the Governor's Task Force on Overdose Prevention and is responsible for overseeing the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP). Overdose Prevention Task Force The Governor's Task Force on Overdose Prevention and Intervention was created by executive order in August 2015. It is co-chaired by the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Director of BHDDH (the state substance abuse agency). The task force meets on a monthly basis and includes state police, local police, healthcare providers, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), the Department of Corrections, the PDMP, recovery and treatment community centers, CBOs, and individuals in active recovery. In November 2015, the Task Force published a Strategic Plan and in May 2016, the Task Force released an Action Plan that outlines how the Strategic Plan will be implemented. The Strategic Plan includes four strategic initiatives: (1) expanding access to medication assisted treatment (MAT), (2) saturating high risk populations with naloxone, (3) preventing high risk prescribing of opioids, and (4) increasing access to peer-based recovery services. Each strategy has a statewide working group committed to development, implementation, and evaluation of the respective strategy. The plan is a rapid response to the overdose epidemic in RI and commits to reducing the number of overdose deaths by one-third within three years. This is a multiagency, volunteer-based approach that leverages existing resources and partnerships to stop the overdose epidemic in RI. Peer Recovery Specialists RIDOH partners with the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities, and Hospitals (the state substance abuse services authority) to fund Peer Recovery Coaches in three settings Emergency Rooms, the Department of Corrections, and through targeted street outreach. A certified peer recovery specialist helps individuals navigate treatment and recovery resources, provides education on overdose prevention, and the use of naloxone, and acts as a contact for additional recovery support. RIDOH has also hosted training for individuals to be trained as Perinatal Peer Recovery Specialists. Priority: Adopt Social Determinants of Health in Public Health Planning The following strategies support RIDOH's priority to adopt social determinants of health in public health planning: Develop certification process & core competencies for the MCH workforce statewide through a Community Health Worker workforce development initiative. RI has benefited from a Certification Program for Community Health Workers since 2016. To date, there are 340 Certified Community Health Workers in RI, each with demonstrated competency in the following domains: Domains - Engagement Methods and Strategies - Individual and Community Assessment - Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Responsiveness - Promote Health and Well-Being - Care Coordination and System Navigation - Public Health Concepts and Approaches - Advocacy and Community Capacity Building - Safety and Self-Care - Ethical Responsibilities and Professional Skills Standards - Experience: Six months or 1000 hours of paid or volunteer work experience within five years - Supervision: 50 hours specific to the domains - Education: 70 hours relevant to the domains - Portfolio: Demonstrated competency through approved portfolio. The portfolio is a collection of personal and professional activities and achievements. This part of the requirement for the Community Health Worker is highly personalized and no two applicants will submit the same documentation. Components of the portfolio include documentation and requirements of at least three of these categories: Community Experience & Involvement Research Activities College Level Courses / Advanced or Specialized Training Community Publications Presentations & Projects Statement of Professional Experience Achievements / Awards Resume / Curriculum Vitae (CV) Performance Evaluation Training and Development RI MCH Program partners with the following training entities for CHW education and preparation: - Community Health Innovations of RI provides ongoing training and apprenticeship opportunities especially for CHWs based in the community through health Equity Zones - Rhode Island College Healthy Jobs offers ongoing CHW courses at Central Falls Parent College, Rhode Island College campus in Providence throughout the academic term, and in a centralized Warwick location - RIDOH Chronic Disease Programs offers core community health worker training and modules specific to patient navigators working in chronic disease through the CHWARI. - Rhode Island Parent Information Network provides ongoing training opportunities for Resource Specialist including parents of children with special healthcare needs - Clinica Esperanza sponsors ongoing Navagante trainings for Bilingual / Bicultural CHWs. All of these training programs have aligned their curriculum with Rhode Island's Certified Community Health Worker standards meeting the certification requirements. RI MCH Program also partners with the Department of Labor & Training in supporting the Community Health Worker Association of Rhode Island (CHWARI) at Rhode Island College. CHWARI is an organization to provide CHWs resources around trainings and other professional development opportunities. The Community Health Worker Association of Rhode Island (CHWARI) actively supports frontline healthcare workers who work in underserved communities to improve high quality healthcare access for people in need. CHWARI envisions a state in which all Rhode Island communities receive high quality, equitable health and social services in order for all individuals to realize their optimal state of health and well-being. The mission of CHWARI is to increase the power of Rhode Island's Community Health Workers to promote health equity through increasing access to quality healthcare and social services and conducting advocacy. Continue to Support a Comprehensive System of Engagement & Leadership Development for Vulnerable Populations RIDOH's supports a comprehensive system of engagement and leadership development for vulnerable populations through the following initiatives: Health Equity Institute: Health Equity Institute (HEI) was created by Director Nicole Alexander-Scott, MD, MPH in 2016 as a strategy to promote RIDOH's three leading priorities. The priorities include: - addressing the social and environmental determinants of health - eliminating the disparities of health and promote health equity and - ensuring access to quality health services for Rhode Islanders, including our vulnerable populations The mission of the HEI is to address systemic inequities so that all Rhode Islanders achieve their ideal life outcome regardless of their race, geography, disability status, education, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, language, age, or economic status. HEI recognizes that achieving health equity requires action, leadership, inclusion, cross-sectoral collaboration and shared responsibility throughout RIDOH, and communities across the state. HEI has substantial expertise in providing communities and policymakers with data, technical assistance, and evidence-based programs to address health disparities in vulnerable populations. Several large programs are housed within the HEI, including: Disability & Health, Minority Health, Refugee Health, Maternal and Child Health and the Health Equity Zones (HEZ). HEI also provides collaborative support to all of RIDOH's equity initiatives including: the Social Justice Roundtable, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Workgroup, Vulnerable Populations Data Collection Workgroup, Disparities in Population Health Goals, Social Determinants of Health Workgroup, Community Health Assessment Group, Commission for Health Advocacy & Equity, Community Health Resiliency Project, and the Kresge Initiative. Healthy Equity Communication Trainings: RIDOH received a Kresge Foundation Applied Learning Resource Grant through the Emerging Leaders in Public Health (ELPH) initiative to support agency transformation to integrate social justice into RIDOH's practices and create a new role for public health to advocate for social and environmental justice policies. As part of this work, RIDOH partnered with The Praxis Project and Berkeley Media Studies Group (BMSG) to host two full-day trainings to help us communicate more effectively about social justice and health equity. The ELPH Initiative provided critical support that has helped RIDOH transform the way we communicate about health disparities enabled RIDOH to obtain technical assistance and training for staff across the department from leading experts in the health equity and health communications field, including The Praxis Project1 and Berkeley Media Studies Group2. As a result of this training, RIDOH has developed new messaging to help make the case for advancing health equity and social justice, and garner support for specific health equity initiatives, like its Health Equity Zone model. RIDOH has also begun applying a stronger racial equity lens to its messaging, explicitly calling out racism as a barrier to health and advocating for approaches that advance racial equity. To encourage further engagement in health equity work across the Department, RIDOH continues the regular health equity series in its employee newsletter, called \"Health Equity Now,\" and maintains a page on its intranet to share health equity resources and training opportunities with employees. RIDOH is also exploring how to better highlight stories about how employees are advancing health equity in their work, and how the lived experiences of employees motivate them to do this work. With funding from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), and in partnership with ChangeLab Solution, RIDOH published, updated, and maintains the [Health Equity Zones: A Toolkit for building Healthy and Resilient Communities](http://bit.ly/HEZ-toolkit), which demonstrates how together, state and local health departments can all begin to guide our communities towards the goal of truly achieving health equity. This toolkit explores what it means to establish Health Equity Zones, identifies the four key components of an HEZ-like initiative, and describes how RIDOH's HEZ model and theory of change address the shortcomings of traditional public health prevention approaches. In addition, with the support of ELPH project consultants Human Impact Partners and Berkeley Media Studies Group, RIDOH's Health Equity Institute (HEI) created a guide, \"Building a Shared Language around Health Equity,\" to foster shared understanding about terms and concepts including social justice, institutional racism, and structural inequities. Commission for Health Advocacy and Equity: RIDOH, Health Equity Institute convenes the Commission for Health Advocacy and Equity (CHAE). The CHAE is a legislatively mandated commission created to address the social determinants of health and eliminate health disparities. The CHAE membership reflects the diversity of RI, including individuals from or representing racial / ethnic minorities (Latino, Native American, and Black), persons with disabilities, LGBTTQQ, and people with limited English proficiency. Members also represent a variety of disciplines including consumers/residents, academia, housing, substance use, advocacy, medicine, public health, business, child welfare, local government, community development, planning, commerce, transportation, and social services. The Commission is required to complete a Disparities Impact and Evaluation legislative report every two years. The first report was published in January 2015 and it identifies disparities in 5 areas (nutrition and physical activity, asthma, infant mortality, chronic illnesses and oral health) that needed to be addressed. In addition to the five focus areas, the report identifies global recommendations for addressing health disparities in RI. The second report released in December 2017, establishes definitions of equity terminology including health, health equity, determinants of health, and health disparities and identified 2 priority areas that the Commission's work will focus on for the next two years. These priority areas are (1) increase minimum wage to $15 per hour, and (2) increase high school graduation rates. The Commission actively engages with community organizations, members of the public, and legislators to impact these two priority areas. The third report was published in January 2020 and highlights RI's Statewide Health Equity Indicators. This report provides data related to these measures to help educate the Rhode Island General Assembly, State agencies, and partner organizations on health inequities in Rhode Island. For each measure, the report also includes examples of programs and policies in Rhode Island and across the country that are showing promise for reducing inequities. During the 2020 pandemic, CHAE members participated on the State's Equity Council to ensure equitable access to both COVID-19 testing and vaccine allocations. CHAE also issued a letter to the Governor in May 2020 sharing their urgent concerns from the community and recommendations pertaining to racial equity and health justice during the current COVID-19 crisis. Refugee Health Program (RHP): The responsibilities of the RI-RHP include tracking new refugees who enter the state via the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Electronic Disease Notification (EDN), ensuring that all new refugees receive an initial health assessment within 30 days (in compliance with ORR State Letter 12-09 guidelines), tracking refugee health status through the completion of the Rhode Island version of the refugee health screening form, holding refugee network stakeholder meetings to connect stakeholders, sharing information with community agencies and health care providers, and assisting in the completion of the I-693 report of medical examination and vaccination form, which accompanies refugee green card applications. The ORR Refugee Health Promotion Program Grant enables the RI-RHP to assist refugee resettlement agencies and health clinics in building on their health promotion activities for refugees who are recent arrivals. Rhode Island arrivals in 209 totaled 89 with refugees largely coming from the following countries: Burundi, United Republic of Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ukraine, Somalia, Syria, and Colombia, and Eritrea. The mean age of refugees is 21 years old with a range of 3 to 65 years. All newly arrived adult refugees attend community orientation that covers a multitude of topics geared to helping the newly arrived refugees adjust to their new environment. The major areas of focus include the following: Medical and Health issues, Rights and Responsibilities of Refugees, Employment Counseling, Housing, Financial Literacy, Social Guidelines, School Registration, Education, and Cultural Adjustment. Within this framework, more detailed discussions are dedicated to topics that are immediately relevant to the lives of each family. All the newly arrived refugees are connected to the local healthcare providers for medical screenings and vaccinations. The medical case management services include navigation of the health care system beyond primary care providers to include pharmacies, dentists, ophthalmologists, immunologists, audiologists, obstetricians, imaging specialists, insurance providers, billing offices, and others. Newly arrived refugees attend four sessions within the first 3 weeks after arrival. Interpreters are provided as needed. Due to COVID-19 and a capping on the number of refugees allowed to resettle in the United States, the RHP saw a record low in 2020 for the number of refugees placed in Rhode Island. Culturally Linguistic Appropriate Services (CLAS): The Rhode Island Health Equity Institute (HEI) has been actively developing and implementing CLAS throughout Rhode Island through a multi-faceted approach. - CLAS Training: RIDOH conducts CLAS training for RIDOH staff as well as community partners to enhance the implementation of culturally and linguistically appropriate services. These trainings include practical ways of improving language access and creating an environment that is welcoming of diverse cultural backgrounds. Examples of community partners that have received training include: college students, refugee service providers, case workers for child protective services, state agencies and more. - CLAS Materials: In addition to the CLAS training for community partners, RIDOH distributes \"I Speak Cards\" which are durable, bilingual wallet-sized resources that educate the public about their rights regarding language access. There are efforts underway to evaluate the use of these cards. - CLAS Complaints: RIDOH has revamped the process for tracking and handling CLAS related complaints. CLAS related complaints are now handled through the centralized customer service line. This has resulted in an improvement in the coordination between the customer service staff, health facilities regulation staff, and the Health Equity Institute regarding addressing complaints. - Facilitating Training of Bilingual Staff: RIDOH is working to compile a repository of state and web-based programs that enable staff of RIDOH and any other facility to become a certified interpreter/translator. This initiative is designed to rectify the common practice in the community of non-certified bilingual staff serving as translators or interpreters. - CLAS Champion Program: RIDOH runs a CLAS Champion elective for physicians who are working under a J1 Visa. Doctors working under a J1 Visa are required to engage in one of three options of meaningful public service-oriented work, one of which is becoming a CLAS champion. This involves undergoing CLAS training and championing CLAS at their respective institutions thereafter. In 2019 RIDOH had 27 doctors in the J1 Visa program complete CLAS training. There are efforts to better engage the CLAS champions regularly and better understand how they are serving as ambassadors for CLAS at their respective institutions. Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) workgroup: The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) has formed two large, multidisciplinary teams which are working to improve LGBTTQQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Two- Spirit, Queer and Questioning) public health policies, systems, and environmental change. One SOGI Equity Work Group is internal, working to improve RIDOH's ability to measure and document health disparities impacting these populations, and to promulgate policy and systems changes improving RIDOH's ability to meet these needs. The second SOGI Equity work group facilitates dialogue and identifies collective action opportunities among RIDOH and its Community Partners\u2014other organizations (healthcare providers, CBOs, advocacy groups, other State agencies, etc.) serving the needs of these populations\u2014to help improve and coordinate community and State supports and responses. Sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals often face a variety of healthcare challenges, including identifying and accessing providers who are knowledgeable about their health risks and behaviors and who provide culturally affirming care. SOGI health is also intersectional \u2014 sexual orientation and gender identity/ expression are important parts of a person's identity, but there are often other demographic factors, societal biases, and other circumstances influencing equity and access to care. The group works to ensure that our health surveillance systems include questions about sexual orientation and gender identity to establish accurate statewide public health data, encourage intersectional workforce development across partnerships to improve our collective ability to respond to SGM health inquiries, and build relationships with other organizations to improve SGM equity statewide. Recent initiatives include: - Data and Surveillance: In 2016, RIDOH began including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) optional module on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in RI's adult Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. RIDOH also began including a gender identity question in RI's high school Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) in 2017. RIDOH began analyzing findings from these surveys related to gender identity, and issued a brief on YRBS results to community partners at the state's most recent Trans Health Conference in 2019. - SGM Health Resources: RIDOH has developed a list of resources that RI SGM community members may find helpful in assessing culturally proficient healthcare. To view these resources, visit www.health.ri.gov/lgbt. - RI Pride and SGM Event Sponsorship: RIDOH has been a proud sponsor of RI's Pride Festival since 2016, distributing public health resources and standing with SGM Rhode Islanders to celebrate their many contributions to our wider community. At RI Pride, dozens of RIDOH staff have volunteered their time to provide SGM attendees with information and support around issues such as sexual health and wellness, HIV/STI prevention, smoking cessation, cancer screening, chronic disease self-management, sun safety, healthy relationships, HPV immunization, tick/ outdoor safety, and adolescent health. Please note: Pride has been suspended since the pandemic began, but it is anticipated that there will be a state Pride event in 2022. Additionally, SOGI Equity has organized Department-wide sponsorship of additional SGM events, including a biennial Trans Health Conference and a Trans Day of Remembrance event. RIDOH staff have also offered technical assistance as guests presenting information to local CBOs. - Listening Forums on SGM Health and Public Safety: RIDOH held a listening forum with the City of Providence in 2016 to learn more about ways to improve health and public safety for SGM community members. RIDOH held a second listening forum on SGM youth concerns in 2018.These types of events are a valuable means of gathering community input; it is envisioned that they will continue to be held in more accessible, virtual spaces post-pandemic. - All-Access Restroom at RIDOH's Cannon Building: As part of planned renovations to modernize its public restrooms, RIDOH has designated two of its bathrooms within the Cannon Building as all-gender (all access). These facilities ensure a more welcoming environment for SGM visitors and staff, as well as families, caregivers, individuals with disabilities, individuals with atypical bodies and physical presentations, and others. RI Department of Health Information Line: The RIDOH Information Line (HIL) is the Department of Health's single point of entry for telephone inquiries. The HIL answers an average of 6800 calls per month on behalf of the Department's programs and the Director's office. When there is a Health emergency within the Department or the State (e.g., COVID-19) the HIL will set up a separate line for the specific emergency. From October 02, 2019 - September 30, 2020 we have received a total of 206,867 calls (5,245 in Spanish and 457 in Portuguese), 122,510 calls were just for COVID-19. The office hours on the HIL are from 8:30-4:30pm, Monday through Friday. There are always at least two individuals (bilingual) on the phone line. The telephone system used by the HIL is a Uniform Call Distribution (UCD) system. This system allows all calls coming into RIDOH to come into a single number. From there, HIL staff will answer the calls and route them to the appropriate program/division if they cannot be answered by staff. The HIL phone number is 401-222-5960. The HIL maintains a call database. All staff have access to the database through their own computer with a personal login. Once a call is received, it is logged into the HIL call database. There is a Database Input Sheet that is used when logging in calls. There are currently 38 programs listed on the input sheet, for which calls are taken. The HIL maintains three voicemail boxes: an English voicemail, a Spanish voicemail and an emergency voicemail. There is also a central email account for anyone wishing to contact RIDOH with questions, which is also answered by HIL staff. The HIL also manages the complaint intake for Health Professionals and Facilities Regulation. The complaints are received via telephone, e-mail, e-fax or walk-in. They are processed and forwarded to the respective programs. RIDOH also has the ability to stand up an Emergency Information Line (EIL) as needed to respond to a high volume of calls during emergencies and other crisis response scenarios. RIDOH is currently utilizing the EIL to respond to inquiries from the public related to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) response. Family to Family Health Information Center: RIPIN is also the Rhode Island's HRSA funded F2FHIC, which is housed within Family Voices. This program provides families of CSHCNs with support, resource referral, training workshops, advocacy, and relevant information via newsletters/publications/websites. The National Center of Leadership for Family and Professional Partnerships provides technical assistance, training, and connections to F2FHICs. Title V dollars are utilized to provide staffing support. RIREACH: RIREACH is an initiative under the RI Parent Information Network (RIPIN) Call Center that works in partnership with the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC) and HealthSource RI. RIREACH helps Rhode Islanders with any type of health insurance including: Medicaid, Medicare, commercial coverage (provided by an employer or purchased through HealthSource, RI) and the uninsured. Using a diverse team of advocates through a peer-to-peer support model, RIREACH provides assistance on the phone or in person, at both consumer's homes and within the community, providing multi-program expertise that is critical to their ability to solve complex issues. Together with RI Family Voices, RIREACH provides valuable information and support to families of CYSHCN and transitioning youth in navigating and utilizing health insurance. Develop \"data-to-action\" initiatives to build internal and interagency support and action RIDOH's supports the following \"data-to-action\" initiatives to build internal and interagency support and action: Statewide Health Equity Indicators: Over the past few years, the Health Equity Institute (HEI) went through an extensive community engagement process where the Community Health Assessment Group examined more than 180 potential indicators to measure Rhode Island's progress in advancing health equity. This process led to the selection, in 2018, of a core set of 15 health equity indicators in 5 domains: integrated healthcare, community resiliency, physical environment, socioeconomics, and community trauma. Data comes from various sources. When possible, data are reported by geographic location, race/ethnicity, disability status, income level, or other demographic characteristics. The selected measures are intended to help communities assess the impact of health equity initiatives, such as RI's Health Equity Zones, by providing baseline data and supporting outcomes evaluation. They also provide a way to measure our shared progress. A complete list of Rhode Island's Statewide Health Equity Indicators can be found in the Appendix. HEZ MCH Activities Analysis Summary and Proposed Metrics: An examination and analysis of the end of year reports of activities of each Health Equity Zone provided information to form a summary of activities by grouping MCH related activities by type of activity, social determinants of health addressed, and populations served. The Health Equity Zones (HEZs) provided MCH related activities and programs across the different HEZs to communities in six primary focus areas addressing Social Determinants of Health, as identified by the needs of the communities. These key areas of MCH activities across the HEZs include: - Family and parenting support/education (including infant safe sleep education); - Youth/teen engagement, education, academic and social-emotional support, mental health, health education, and sexual health education; - Quality/healthy child care, afterschool programming, preschool, and Kindergarten readiness; - Healthy lifestyles for youth and family, including healthy food access and availability, nutrition, breastfeeding support, and exercise; - Healthy homes, including lead and asthma correlates; and - COVID-19 related health needs and supports, including PPE, food, and education. Given these six primary areas of activities and reach, the following measures are proposed for tracking and evaluation over time of each of these areas as well as the overall impact of MCH activities within the HEZ areas and for the Health Equity Zone initiative overall as it relates to MCH activities: - Childhood obesity rates for different age groups ranging from infant to high school, and infant mortality rates (related to programs/activities of healthy lifestyles/nutrition and healthy food access/exercise/breastfeeding support); - Child maltreatment rates and infant mortality (related to family/parenting support/education); - High school graduation rates, school chronic absenteeism, and teen birth rates (related to youth engagement, academic and social-emotional support, and health and sexual education); - Preschool and childcare enrollment rates, and Kindergarten readiness scores (related to quality, healthy childcare and preschool access, and afterschool programming); - Incidence of high household lead, rates of childhood asthma/incidence of asthma related ER visits among children, tobacco use rates in homes with children (related to healthy homes); - COVID-19 incidence and vaccination rates by area (related to COVID-19 related health needs) MCH Data Dashboard: The SSDI Program developed an MCH data \"dashboard\" that is available internally to MCH program management on a SharePoint folder. The dashboard is an Excel spreadsheet that includes all state and federal Title V outcome, performance and evidence-based or -informed strategy measures, as well as the SSDI minimum and core data set, with separate tabs for each. Definitions and descriptions of the numerator and denominators for each measure are presented, along with historical data up to 10 years back and future targets through the year 2023. Where relevant, national averages and Healthy People 2020 objectives are presented for comparison. These data can be used to inform program planning, policy decisions, needs assessment and grant writing. Next steps include connecting the dashboard, using Power BI software, to the RIDOH website to display selected MCH data measures for the public. KIDSNET: KIDSNET is a population-based integrated child health information system that facilitates the collection and appropriate sharing of preventive health services data for the provision of timely and appropriate follow-up. It contains demographic data and information on children's preventive health services for all RI children born on or after January 1, 1997. KIDSNET also serves as Rhode Island's childhood immunization registry for children up to age 19. Expansion of the immunization registry component of KIDSNET was completed, providing capacity to evaluate the immunization status of pregnant womxn. Currently it links data related to the following: newborn screening (bloodspot, hearing and developmental screening), vital records, family visiting, immunization, lead screening, WIC, Early Intervention, early childhood developmental screening, Asthma (Breathe Easy at Home), Cedar (Medicaid Care Coordination), Head Start, and insurance as well as having connections to birth defects and foster care data. State-wide data systems for Child Outreach and Dental Sealant programs are built into KIDSNET. Also collected are enrollment data from major health insurers (including all Medicaid Managed Care plans) and Head Start as well as developmental screening from participating primary care providers and Cedar Family Centers. Because of the integrated nature and easy on-line access, medical homes, child health programs, Early Intervention (Part C), specialty care providers, Head Start, School Nurse Teachers, home visitors, and other authorized users can access information necessary for case management, care coordination, and the tracking of children who are missing or need follow-up from various preventive health services such as newborn hearing screening, lead screening, and immunization. KIDSNET data managers support MCH programs by responding to numerous data requests for program development, quality assurance, and quality improvement activities. For example, the Newborn Hearing Screening and Early Childhood Programs work with the Early Intervention (EI) Program to reduce the number of families who do not consent to share data in KIDSNET and to reduce the number of children where consent is missing. These programs use KIDSNET to identify when children are enrolled in EI so complete data is important. Another example is KIDSNET working with WIC, Family Visiting, Cedar, Head Start, and Early Intervention to promote the running of reports to assure clients receive preventive services and follow-up. This is critical to efforts to reverse the declines in lead screening and immunization associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The inclusion of race, ethnicity, insurance and address information allows data analysis at that level to support public health planning and understanding of those social determinants of health. RITRACK migration to KIDSNET: The newborn hearing screening database (RITRACK) was developed in the early 1990's as a stand-alone system. At the time, it met the needs of the newborn hearing screening program. Over time, data transfer between RITRACK and KIDSNET has improved its functionality but still has several issues. It is inefficient and no longer meets the needs of the program, it requires Women & Infant IT department support and it is unavailable to RIDOH staff. Migration of the functionality of RITRACK directly into KIDSNET is underway to resolve these issues. Program staff used test data to simulate work-flow and worked with the developers to fine tune the system prior to the anticipated release into KIDSNET in June 2021. Title V funding was blended with other sources to cover the overall project costs. This project improves the efficiency of data management and reduces the time for data to become available to partners serving children and families. These partners assist RIDOH to ensure that all infants receive newborn hearing screen and appropriate follow-up. The KIDSNET data system provides PCPs, audiologists, Early Intervention, home visitors, WIC, and other community partners access to run hearing screening follow-up reports on their patients/clients to help reduce loss to follow-up from newborn hearing screenings. PRAMS Data and Oral Health: The Rhode Island Oral Health Program used 2012 - 2017 Rhode Island Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data to understand the impact of efforts to increase the number of pregnant women receiving dental care. A lifetime of good oral health care starts during pregnancy. Dental caries is one of the most common chronic, preventable diseases among children. In fact, it is five times more common than asthma. The bacteria that cause dental caries is transmissible between mother and baby. Providing anticipatory guidance to the mom-to-be and providing her with good dental care will create a pattern for good oral health of the whole family. In Rhode Island, pregnant women enrolled in Medicaid receive a dental benefit. However, in 2015, only 55% of pregnant women received preventive dental care. The results of this analysis (1) illustrate the need for funding to address oral health of pregnant women and (2) help RIDOH monitor the impact of the Perinatal and Infant Oral Health Quality Improvement Project (PIOHQI), a four-year grant that was awarded by the Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA) to decrease the prevalence of dental caries in infants and pregnant women. PRAMS data & Maternal Depression: The Rhode Island Maternal Psychiatry Resource Network (RI MomsPRN) Program continues to actively collaborate with RIDOH's Center for Health Data, Analysis, and Public Health Informatics Unit to collect and analyze related maternal depression and behavioral health data within the PRAMS survey. This past year staff from both units collaborated to create a report and related poster for the RI Prematurity Task Force Summit that explored the connection between maternal mental health and preterm birth. Both the publication and related poster were distributed and highlighted to 125 attending prenatal care staff on November 14, 2019. The Summit also featured a panel discussion that included RI MomsPRN clinical staff and a related keynote address by Dr. Jennifer Payne, Director of the Women's Mood Disorder Center from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The panel discussion further reinforced and explored findings in the PRAMS data report. In addition, the two RIDOH units continue to analyze related phase 8 PRAMS data (2016-2018) and are actively partnering with a Brown University Public Health School Graduate Student to create a maternal depression during pregnancy report. COVID-19 staff reassignment at RIDOH has delayed the finalization of this brief, but it will be completed in the near future as RIDOH staff return to their normal job functions. This partnership also resulted in PRAMS behavioral health data being included in a new Title V perinatal mental health factsheet, which is being used to guide stakeholder strategic discussions. Finally, RI MomsPRN funds continue to support the administration of the RI PRAMS survey and the fielding of substance use disorder related modules and questions that will be reportable in the near future. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS): BRFSS is an annual state-based telephone survey assessing the health status and behavioral risk factors of the non-institutionalized adult population 18 years of age and older. The BRFSS survey provides valuable information on health trends, chronic disease risks, and data for monitoring the effectiveness of policies, programs, and interventions. Subject areas include self-reported health status, access to health care, health awareness, use of preventive services, as well as knowledge and attitudes of healthcare and healthcare practices. BRFSS data collection, analysis and reporting is a critical component of the 5-year needs assessment, and BRFSS results are used by the MCH program, other RIDOH programs, state agencies, academic institutions, non-profit organizations and others to develop and evaluate programs that promote the health of Rhode Island residents. About one half of the questions asked on the 2021 survey were recommended by the Rhode Island Department of Health. BRFSS collects data related to 17 of the 23 Population Health Goals of RIDOH's Strategic Framework, including: - Reduce obesity in children, teens, and adults - Reduce chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, heart disease, asthma, and cancer - Promote the health of mothers and their children - Promote senior health to support independent living - Promote behavioral health and wellness among all Rhode Islanders - Support Rhode Islanders in ongoing recovery and rehabilitation for all aspects of health - Increase access to safe, affordable, healthy food - Reduce environmental toxic substances, such as tobacco and lead - Improve access to care including physical health, oral health, and behavioral health systems - Expand models of care delivery and healthcare payment focused on improved outcomes - Increase patients' and caregivers' engagement within care systems - Reduce communicable diseases, such as HIV and Hepatitis C - Reduce substance use disorders - Minimize exposure to traumatic experiences, such as bullying, violence, and neglect - Ensure that quality public health data are collected consistently using current technology - Analyze public health data to monitor trends, identify emerging problems, and determine populations at risk - Provide public health data to support program planning, policy development, and surveillance needs BRFSS also provides data to inform some of RIDOH's Health Equity Indicators, which addresses RIDOH's three leading priorities: - Integrated Healthcare: Healthcare Access (percentage of adults who reported not seeking medical care or dental care due to cost - Community Trauma: Discrimination (percentage of adults reporting racial discrimination in healthcare settings) The Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS): YRBS is a collaboration between CDC, RIDOH, RIDE, and BHDDH. The survey, which is administered every two years, is implemented through anonymous questionnaires in a random sample of Rhode Island public high schools and middle schools. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and challenges facing schools and students, the RI Department of Health postponed the administration of the 2021 RI YRBS from Spring until Fall 2021. The survey will be fielded between September - December 2021 and will include state added questions related to the following topics: prescription drugs, maternal and child health priorities, oral health, homelessness, food insecurity, transportation safety, gender expression, transgender status, and assets. The data are used to help policy makers, school administrators, social service workers, and public health professionals understand trends in the health behaviors of young people across the state and to create health-related policies that will impact those behaviors. At RIDOH, data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey are used to develop health programs for adolescents throughout Rhode Island and to understand how students are disproportionately affected by different health issues. Understanding these disparities allows an opportunity to address the factors at the community-level that affect students' decisions and behaviors. Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) Academic Center: The RIDOH Academic Center was created in 2015 to enhance RIDOH's capacity to integrate scholarly activities into public health policy and practice by establishing and facilitating collaborations with academic and research colleagues across the state, and build upon internal and external partnerships and synergy to establish the RIDOH Culture of Learning at the department. The RIDOH Academic Institute supports three areas of engagement to achieve these goals: Public Health Education and Research, Workforce and Career Development, and Research Integrity and Accreditation. Public Health Education and Research: Through the work of the RIDOH Academic Institute, RIDOH has become an Academic Health Department that looks forward to having formal affiliations with all of Rhode Island's colleges and universities. Formal affiliations currently exist with: Brown University School of Public Health, Community College of Rhode Island, Johnson and Wales University, New England Institute of Technology, Providence College, Rhode Island College, Roger Williams University, and University of Rhode Island. Collaboration between RIDOH programs and academic faculty is encouraged based on RIDOH's public health policy and practice and similar research and teaching interests of academic faculty. These partnerships drive development of collaborative research ideas that create experiential learning opportunities for RIDOH Public Health Scholars, who are undergraduate, graduate, professional or clinical students currently enrolled in courses of study that relate to public health. RIDOH's utilization of a health equity lens for public health program planning and policy development provides multidisciplinary opportunities for collaboration with faculty and students in programs of study such as public health, healthcare, communications, graphic design, technology, housing, finance, law, urban planning, architecture, etc. Collaborative state-academic forums and partnerships are developed to enhance statewide research and outcomes in public health-related topic areas. These research-based groups include multiple researchers from various academic institutions as well as state agencies and community partners. Research Integrity and Accreditation: To facilitate appropriate use of RIDOH data, public health research is reviewed by the RIDOH Institutional Review Board to ensure ethical use of human subject research in compliance with federal laws. Additionally, RIDOH's quality and performance is advanced through measurement and comparison with nationally recognized, practice-focused, evidence-based standards to improve and protect the public's health. Between October 2019 - September 2020, RIDOH staff authored the following MCH related journal articles: 1.
