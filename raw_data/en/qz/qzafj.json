In the same spirit, the 2016 launch of theFrench plan for genomic medicine ( AVIESAN, 2016 ) was designed to serve a range of medical disciplines, includingcancer and rare diseases. The France Genomic Medicine 2025plan cited rare diseases as one of the key areas at the forefront ofNGS implementation, to improve patient care, shorten theirdiagnostic odyssey and boost research. Indeed, geneticdiagnosis is the rst step towards appropriate care, follow-up and genetic counseling. Moreover, enhancing our understanding of pathogenesis could help to elaborate more speci c therapies. The general goal of French Genomic Medicine plan is toimplement the use of Genome Sequencing (GS) in Francewithin the next 10 years, by creating national sequencingplatforms (2 of which are now fully operational), and as a kickoff, to implement four pilot studies, one of which is dedicated torare diseases, namely the DEFIDIAG pilot study. This DEFIDIAG pilot study focuses on intellectual disability (ID), as one of the most challenging models of rare disease. IDaffects around 1 -3% of the general population, with around 15 per 1,000 persons having mild ID and around 3 per 1,000 having severe ID. It is the most common cause of referral to pediatricgenetic centers. ID results from abnormal brain development dueto numerous possible cellular processes, including neuronproliferation and differentiation, neuron or astrocytemetabolism and maintenance, neurotransmitter synthesis,receptor or signal transduction, transcriptional andtranslational control. It is also well recognized that mayresult from non-genetic causes (neonatal anoxia, toxic effects,deprivation ...) or from genetic causes. Gene and chromosomal variations involved in human ID are numerous and include recurrent chromosomal events from complete chromosomal duplication, segmental chromosomal duplication small genic variations altering the function one amongmore than 1,500 genes such as single nucleotide variants (SV) in coding or non-coding regions, or even rarer events such as repeat expansions, uniparental disomy, mobile element insertion etc., which arereported in the registry. Approximately 15% ID isattributable to cytogenetically clear-cut abnormalities, with atleast two-thirds of these cases accounted for by trisomy 21(Ellison et al., 2013 ) and up to 40% to one variation in one of the 1500 ID gene when exome sequencing is performed ( Han and Lee, 2020 ). Before next generation sequencing methods, genetic testing was limited to traditional karyotype and fragile X analysis, sometimeswith gene speci c Sanger analysis, when a speci cs y n d r o m i cI Dw a s suspected. In the past 10 years, mi croarray analysis (CMA) has been widely used for the genetic diagnosis of ID. NGS tests recentlyemerged, in the last 5 years, with gene panel approaches andWhole Exome Sequencing (ES) following CMA and fragile Xsyndrome screening. Today, the question arises about the input ofwhole genome sequencing as a rst approach in such patients, as this m a yp r o f o u n d l ym o d i f yt h et e s t i n gp r o c e s sb yr e p l a c i n gC M Aa n dother sequencing approaches (speci c genes, panel, ES) and in addition, may detect new molecular mechanisms not detectable byCMA and ES. Nowadays, most patients with no clinical diagnosis in France still undergo basic investigation (Fragile X and CMA) with a diagnostic yield of less than 20%. This basic exploration is usually followed by additional analysis using gene panel approachescontaining at the very least a minimal core of 44 genes,namely the 44GPS minimal list recommended by the Frenchnational association of molecular genetics practitioners(Association Nationale des Praticiens de G\u00e9n\u00e9tiqueMol\u00e9culaire, ANPGM). The panel sequencing in the probandgives an additional diagnostic yield of 10 -12% (using the 44 gene panel), and up to 40% ( Han and Lee, 2020 ) in case of ES. ES as the rst line test for the diagnosis of rare genetic diseases has recently been shown in some countries to be cost-effective, tripling the diagnostic rate at one third of the cost, in children with suspected monogenic disorders ( Stark et al., 2017 ;Schoeld et al., 2019 ). There is also emerging evidence of the ef ciency of GS over Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 766964 2Binquet et al. DeDiag Study Protocolstandard testing ( Alam and Scho eld, 2018 ). However, the heterogeneity in clinical presentation, sample sizes and healtheconomic evaluation standards makes it dif cult to generalize the rst published results ( Schwarze et al., 2018 ) to other settings. A recent study in Ontario, Canada reported that GS might have a higher diagnostic yield than standard genetic testing, and couldbe a cost-effective strategy when used after standard testing orwhen used earlier in the diagnostic pathway ( Ontario Health (Quality), 2020 ). However, these results need to be con rmed in the French setting since marked differences exist betweencountries in the technologies used, the costs, and theorganization of clinical, biological and bioinformatics pathways. Against this background, the DEFIDIAG study aims to evaluate the diagnostic performance and cost-effectiveness of GS as asystematic and unique molecular investigation for French patients with ID of unknown etiology, compared to the standard minimal protocol de ned by the ANPGM, under conditions close to routine. Indeed, GS provides an opportunity to analyze a wider panel ofmolecular events, such as: 1) SNV and insertion/deletion (indel) incoding regions, even in CG rich regions, 5 and 3 UTR, promoter or intronic regions; 2) unbalanced chromosomal anomalies accuracy coverage; 3) variants, such as inversion and translocation, 4)mechanisms observed very infrequen tly, such as uniparental disomy for imprinted chromosomal regions or insertion of mobile elements.Genome analysis was chosen because potential splice site mutations in deeper intronic regions are not enriched by exome analysis; CNV in exome enrichment strategies are still not sensitive, speci c and reliable; partial inversions or translocations affecting codingregions are not found by ES, and promoter or regulatory regionsare not analyzed by ES. This study also includes impact studies, aiming to assess the perceived impact for patients and their parents, for whom thistechnique may herald the end of their diagnostic odyssey. To thisend, the DEFIDIAG study involves 15 medical geneticsdepartments with strong clinical expertise in ID patients, aswell as six diagnostic laboratories with a proven track record of competence in ID gene exploration, and the national sequencing platform of the National Center of HumanGenomics Research (CNRGH), recognized for the high qualityof its genomic sequence production and bioinformatics processes. Speci cally, the primary objective of this study is to compare the percentage of causal genetic diagnosis identi ed by GS performed on a trio (the patient and both parents) (GST), tothe use of the current French reference minimal strategy (FragileX + CMA + 44GPS) in ID patients attending a rst genetics consultation. Secondary objectives focus on the diagnostic yield,and include the following: \u0081To compare the percentage of ID causal diagnosis identi ed by GST, to GS in the proband only (i.e., genome in solo,GSS) in a subgroup of randomized patients attending for arst genetic investigation. This evaluation is useful because in genetic counseling, both parents are not always available. \u0081To describe the estimated additional diagnostic yield thatwould be obtained at each step in sequential analysis of theGS data: for the minimal 44GPS gene panel, the list of genesknown to be associated with disease from OMIM (referred to simply as OMIM), and ES, in patients attending for a rst investigation (never-explored patients) and in patients whohave already undergone investigations (previously-explored patients). \u0081To compare the percentage of causal diagnosis of ID identi ed by GST to that obtained with the French reference minimal strategy in various subgroups (de ned according to age, severity of ID, presence of major non-cerebral manifestations or epilepsy), for patients with IDattending for a rst genetic investigation (never-explored patients). \u0081To compare the percentage of causal structural changes(CNV, balanced structural variants) identi ed by GST versus CMA. \u0081The DEFIDAG study also aims to compare the referencestrategy, GST and GSs, in terms of costs and effectivenessfor the causal diagnosis of ID in patients with ID ofunknown etiology, attending for a rst genetic investigation. \u0081Finally, three impact studies are planned. The rst will estimate the costs associated with searching for amolecular diagnosis that could potentially be avoided byperforming GS as the rst line approach. The second will evaluate the impact on the frequency and type of medical,medico-social and psychological care in the year following the release of GS results, compared to care during the year prior to inclusion, in particular in patients who were alreadyengaged in a diagnostic process prior to being invited toparticipate in the DEFIDIAG study. The third impact studywill be performed in two centers, and will use a qualitativeapproach, namely interviews with a sample of parents, toexplore: 1) the burden experienced by the parents, 2)emotional adjustment of the patient and the parents tothe results of genetic tests, and 3) the patient and parents ' perception of the future. METHODS AND ANALYSES Study Setting The DEFIDIAG study is a prospective multicenter diagnostic study comparing two main strategies (namely GST versus theminimal reference strategy) applied in a blinded fashion toconsecutive patients with no obvious clinical diagnosis,referred to medical genetic departments. Each patientincluded serves as their own control, and will undergo bothstrategies being compared. In parallel, the percentage of ID causal diagnosis identi ed by GSS, as compared to GST, will be evaluated in a randomized subgroup of patients attending arst genetic investigation. In addition to the prospective diagnostic study, we will also perform quantitative impact studies to collect data concerningmanagement of patients before inclusion, during the geneticanalyses process, and after the results are made known(Figure 1 ); as well as a qualitative substudy using interviews (one interview after inclusion, a second interview after the results Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 766964 3Binquet et al.

DeDiag Study Protocolare made known to the parents/patients, and a third and nal interview 12 months after the results are made known) in asample of parents. The target population for each objective isdescribed in Table 1 . Strategies Compared In order to avoid producing redundant sequences, for each patient included, one unique set of genomic data sequences will be produced by a unique sequencing platform (CNRGH,Evry, France). Analyses are then performed blindly by twoindependent mirror laboratories: one laboratory will analyzethe genome with the parental inheritance information (GST),while the second will analyze only the 44 genes of the referenceminimal strategy (44GPS), without parental inheritanceinformation, as well as the proband genome (GSS) in arandomized of patients ( Figure ;Supplementary Table S1 ). The results of the 44GPS will be withdrawn from the GS data for all patients, using a speci c bioinformatics ltering procedure that mimics the results obtained using targeted capture analysis(exons \u00b120 intronic bases, SNV and CNV analysis). Fragile-X and CMA (included in the reference strategy) follow the routinecare circuit, which is mainly independent of the GS circuit. GST analysis is performed following a harmonized, consensus protocol adopted by the six clinical laboratories involved in thisstudy, and using a common web interface (Polyweb.fr, developedin-house at the Genetic diseases IMAGINE Institute, Paris,France). All genomic variations are called by standard callers (GATK and BWA) and are subsequently ranked using severalfactors to facilitate analysis (protein impact, inheritance model,ID known gene and control data bases, splice prediction effect ... ) in the Polyweb interface. For the SNV/small indel, the schemecontains a rst minimal ltration step (for SNV/indel, elimination of the variations with over 1,000 hits in GnomAD, or 5 hits at homozygous state). All variations with a predicted protein impact are ranked at the top of the list and will be studiedeven when a rst deleterious causative variation is detected. This broad approach ensures that co-occurring mutations in differentgenes will be identi ed [multi allelism is expected in about 5% of the cases ( Yang et al., 2014 )]. Additional bioinformatics modules such as repeat tracking, promoter and evolutionary conservedregions analysis, and mobile element insertion detection will beimplemented and applied onto negative genome results duringthe ongoing protocol. Speci c protocols for the proband GS data and 44GPS analysis are also developed and shared between the six laboratories. To limit time dedicated to GS proband analysis, SNV/indel analysis only focuses on exonic \u00b120 bases of the known ID genes (SysID list) and OMIM disease-associated genes. When the analysis is completed, variants of interest (highly suspected to be pathogenic) are recorded in a dedicated andsecured electronic Case Report Form (e-CRF). Variant class(pathogenic as class 5 variant, probably pathogenic as class 4variant or of unknown signi cance but highly suspected to be pathogenic as class 3 + variant) is validated during a Multi- FIGURE 2 | Sample flow description (DEFIDIAG study).

Each clinical center (C, numbered 1 -12) is af liated to one reference laboratory (numbered 1 -6) in charge of the analysis of trio-genome sequencing \u2014GST; each laboratory (L) is af liated to 2 clinical recruitment centers as a reference laboratory (for example: L1 will be the reference laboratory for patients from C1 and C2) and wi ll work in pairs with another laboratory (mirror laboratories), in charge of ID44 and of the analysis of solo-genome sequencing (GSS) for patients randomized i n the appropriate sub- group. This mirror laboratory is itself af liated with two other recruitment centers (for example: L1 will be the mirror laboratory for patients from C3 and C4). The 4 clinical centers organize the multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) together with their 2 of cial laboratories.

The results of the microarray analysis and Fragile X analysis will be communicated to families and collected in the dedicated e-CRF by the recruiting genetic team as soon as the results are obtained from the diagnostic laboratories. The laboratories incharge of the GS analyses will remain blinded to these results. TheGS results will be available approximately 6 -9 months after inclusion in the study. In the event of an emergency (such aspregnancy), the blinding can be lifted and the results delivered tofamilies as soon as they become available. Study Endpoint Primary Outcome The primary study endpoint is the identi cation of a causal diagnosis of ID, de ned as the identi cation of one or more class 4 or 5 variant(s) that explain the symptoms presented by thepatient, and validated during a speci c MDM. Secondary Outcomes \u0081Efcacy in terms of diagnostic yield: identi cation of causal structural changes \u0081Efciency: estimation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, expressed in terms of cost per additional positivediagnosis. \u0081Quantitative impact studies \u0081Cost of the diagnostic odyssey: mean cost related to theiterative search for a diagnosis in the previously investigatedpopulation. \u0081Change in follow-up: criteria will be the change in thenumber and type of medical, medico-social, rehabilitative,and psychological care induced by the results of the triogenomic analyses. \u0081Qualitative impact studies: A sociologist and a clinicalpsychologist will explore the consequences on the family,and on the personal, professional and social life of theparents who take care of a child or an adult with ID, as well as the emotional adjustment and possible information overload for the parents at the various stages of the study(inclusion, results rendering, 12 months after receivingresults). Population The DEFIDIAG study will be conducted in 15 clinical geneticcenters in France. All patients consulting a geneticist in one of theparticipating centers will be screened for eligibility. The study willinclude children or adults with ID of unknown etiology (indexcases or probands), whatever the severity (but with proven ID by ad hoc neuropsychological testing in patients in whom ID is clinically questionable), and whatever the associatedmanifestations. Individuals with an obvious ID syndrome witha well-known molecular diagnosis will not be considered forinclusion. Children aged between 0 and 5 years will only beconsidered for inclusion in case of severely delayeddevelopment in terms of motor skills, language, and/orsociability. Patients and both biological parents are included ifthey con rm their willingness to comply with all the studyprocedures, their availability for the duration of the study, and sign the appropriate consent forms. Non-inclusion criteria include: isolated learning disabilities; no possibility of obtaining a blood sample from both biological parents; any in the patient condition that, in the investigator 's opinion, would jeopardize compliance with the protocol; one orboth parents with ID; parent placed under judicial protection(guardianship, curatorship, tutorship). The strategy based on GST is expected to yield a diagnosis in at least 60% of patients with ID versus 30% with the referenceminimal strategy in the population of patients attending for a rst genetic investigation (never-explored patients). However, thestrategies will be compared in 7 subgroups: 1) 3 de ned by age: children <2 years old/2 -5 years/ >5 years; 2) 4 subgroups of patients de ned according the severity of ID, and/or 3) with associated manifestations:1) mild ID associated with another sign, 2) moderate to severe ID, 3) ID with major non-cerebral abnormality, and 4) ID associated with epilepsy Thesmallest sub-group (subjects with mild ID associated withanother signi cant sign) should represent around 15% of the total population, and the difference between the GST and thereference strategy in this particular subgroup can be assumed tobe less than 15%. In addition, it is assumed that fewer than 1% ofdiagnoses identi ed with the referral minimal strategy will not be identi ed by the GST. Finally, we will also compare GST and GSS in a subgroup of randomized patients referred for the rst time. For this speci c comparison, a difference of 7% is expected, and <0.1% of diagnoses identi ed by GSS and not by GST. Considering these 9 planned comparisons (8 comparisonsbetween GST and the reference strategy and 1 between GSTand GS), the one-sided alpha risk is xed at 0.00278. Based on these hypotheses, and a power of 80%, among patients seen for arst genetic investigation (50% of the population to be recruited), 41 patients are required for the main comparison, and 91 patientswith mild ID + other syndrome are necessary. To recruit thisnumber of patients, we estimate that it will be necessary to screen607 patients attending for a rst referral. A subgroup of 196 patients will be randomized to undergo GSS in addition to GST plus the reference minimal strategy. The sample size for thissubgroup will be suf cient to compare GST and GSS in terms of diagnostic yield, as well as in terms of ef ciency (a sample size over 150 is usually deemed suf cient). As we intend to include 50% of patients attending for a rst genetics evaluation (never- explored patients), and 50% of patients who have already beeninvestigated (previously-explored patients), a total of 1,214patients are necessary. Considering that approximately 5% ofsamples will not be analyzable, it will therefore be necessary toinclude 1,275 index cases plus both their parents, for a total of 3,825 participants. The qualitative study will be performed in a sub-sample of the overall population, in two centres. In order to maximize thescienti c rigor of the study and to alleviate the potential burden resulting from the interviews, whilst fostering discussionsbetween the sociological and psychological sides, we chose toseparate the interview procedures into two groups. For thepsychological sub-study, 15 interviews with parents will beconducted at each assessment timepoint (T1, T2, T3), giving a Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 766964 6Binquet et al. DeDiag Study Protocoltotal of 45 interviews. For the sociological sub-study, 15 interviews with parents will be conducted at each assessmenttimepoint (T1, T2, T3), giving a total of 45 interviews. A total of15 interviews per assessment timepoint was chosen to achieve data saturation, a key concept of qualitative analysis, namely the point beyond which further interviews do not yield any newinformation ( Glaser and Strauss, 1967 ). As far as possible, the study populations of patients and parents will be strati ed into two subgroups, namely never-explored, and previously-exploredpatients. The subgroups of parents will also be strati ed according to the clinical pro le of the patients (mild vs moderate or severe ID). Study Conduct Inclusion During a genetics consultation and after verifying the inclusionand non-inclusion criteria, the patient and both parents will beinformed about the study by the investigators and invited toparticipate. If they agree either during the visit or after a period ofreflection, they will be invited to sign the consent form. During this visit, the history of the illness, family history, theexaminations already carried out and the correspondingresults will be collected with the assistance of a ClinicalResearch Technician (CRT) in the dedicated e-CRF preparedby the DEFIDIAG methodology and management center(INSERM Clinical Investigation Center \u2014Clinical Epidemiology Unit CIC-EC1432), using CleanWEB software (Telemedecine technologies SAS, Boulogne-Billancourt, France). If necessary,the clinical geneticist will prescribe additional neuropsychologicaltests. A blood sample (5 ml -EDTA tubes) will be obtained fromeach participant (patients with ID as well as both biologicalparents). These blood samples will be sent to the referenceDEFIDIAG laboratory of the center ( Figure 2 ,Supplementary Table S1 ) in compliance with regulations for the shipment of diagnostic samples (category B). A diary will be given to thefamily where they will be asked to note the patients 'use of healthcare and medico-social services until the return of the GS results. This diary makes it possible to collect the medical examinations, biological investigations, rehabilitation andpsychological consultations as well as the medico-socialfollow-up. A follow-up by phone will be performed every3 months by the CRT in order to guarantee the completenessof the collection. For parents/patients willing to participate in the qualitative study in the two centers conducting this part of the study,additional data concerning the familial situation, the numberof children, the social deprivation level and the existence ofinformal and/or professional caregivers at home will be collected, as well as the contact details and address of the participants, for the sociologist or psychologist to organize theinterview. Genomic Circuit All blood samples received for the DEFIDIAG study by thereference laboratory are extracted using a method previouslyvalidated by the sequencing platform (Centre National deRecherche en G\u00e9nomique Humaine, CNRGH). This validationstep was performed on the same blood sample, and genomic sequences obtained after various DNA extraction methods werecompared by the CNRGH in terms of global DNA quality, meancoverage and SNV/CNV detection. In all, ve extractions methods were validated (three automatic and two manual). After blood extraction, 3 \u00b5g DNA aliquots labelled with ananonymous barcode are sent to the CNRGH viaa courier at room temperature. Several quality controls are then performedbefore the sequencing step ( fluorimetric DNA quanti using the DNA integrity number, PCRampli cation test, and sex control). If DNA of the trio is accepted, 1.1 \u00b5g of DNA is fragmented using an optimizedCNRGH GS protocol. The GS is optimized in order to reach amean coverage of 30X for each sample; a minimum of 25X meancoverage is required. Below these speci cations, the sequencing is considered as a failure and will not be repeated. Variant Calling Whole genomic sequences are analyzed by two separate SV and SNV/indel pipelines developed and validated by the CNRGHsequencing platform and IMAGINE bioinformatics team. Brie fly, the raw data will be produced as compressed FASTQ les generated from the. bcl les by the CNRGH sequencing platform. The sequences are aligned to the human reference genome GRCh37using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner BWA software ( Li and Durbin, 2010) and made available as BAM les. Aligned sequences are sorted, cleaned and the PCR duplicates are marked using the Sambamba software ( Tarasov et al., 2015 ) in order to eliminate most of the NGS ' well-known biases. A local realignment of the sequences aroundinsertion and deletion sites and the base quality recalibration isperformed using GATK ( McKenna et al., 2010 ). After sequence quality control and alignment of the reference genome, the CNRGHp e r f o r m st h ev a r i a n tc a l l i n go nt h ee n t i r eg e n o m ef o rt h eS i n g l eNucleotide (SNV), performed using the Haplotype Caller fromGATK software in \"bp resolution les. Imbalanced SV (CNV) Wisecondor ( Raman et al., 2019 ), et al., 2016 ) and Manta Chen et al., 2016 ). (translocation, inversion) detection is done using Manta software.Results are produced in the format of a VCF le to match the common le standard format in NGS analysis. These les are then collected by the IMAGINE Polyweb platform: additional combinedTRIO gVCF analysis (genotypeGvcf) and CNV Wisecondor analysiswill also be performed. Quality Controls Several quality controls are carried out before biological analysis:genome mean coverage over 25X is required for the trio; (SRY detection) and trio concordance ( <1% error transmission in trio using Plink software) arechecked before interpretation. Biological Analysis The .vcf and .bam les are implemented in Polyweb software developed and previously validated by the IMAGINE Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 766964 7Binquet et al. DeDiag Study Protocolbioinformatics platform. This software makes it possible to annotate, analyse and visualise all the genomic variations SNV, small indel, exonic deletion orduplication) and Polycyto (for balanced and unbalanced SV) of all human genes in trio or solo analysis. Moreover, a speci cI D 4 4 bioinformatic gene panel will make it possible to study variationsfrom this gene list. Read variations are visualized using IGV software(Robinson et al., 2011 ). 1) SNV/indel analysis The polyviewer interface gives access to several annotations, such as patient and trio sequencing data (number of mutated andtotal reads), data from et )...), licensed database HGMDpro and also internal databases (D\u00e9j\u00e0Vu), gene or protein predicted impact, splice prediction [SpliceAI(Jaganathan et al., 2019 )], and for trio analysis, inheritance status of the variation. Our objective is not to evaluate the value of GSfor early detection of ID, but rather, to evaluate the risk/bene to f GS for the etiological diagnosis in already-identi ed ID. The internal database (D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu) contained over 20.000 exomes,50.000 panels and 1,000 genomes for SNV/Indel variationswith differentiation between ID and non-ID patients. The following ltration keys are applied to focus on potentially pathogenic variations: GnomAD allele count <1,000, GnomAD homozygote count <5, and predicted protein impact onto all gene transcripts (Stop gain, Stop loss, Start loss, frameshift, in framedeletions or insertions, missense, and predicted splice region,D\u00e9j\u00e0 for patients non ID <1,000 and homozygote count <5). Ranking of identi ed variations is then performed based on internal Polyweb criteria: variation sequence quality, de novo status if available, known ID gene or OMIM gene, protein orsplicing impact prediction, gene with AR inheritance andhomozygous or compound heterozygous variations, male andX linked variation, known pathogenic variations in HGMDpro or ClinVar, frequency in GnomAD. Those criteria will ensure that all variations are analyzed from all known human genes (OMIM or not) that are predicted toaffect proteins. 2) SV analysis The polycyto interface gives access to several annotations using AnnotSV software ( Geoffroy et Vu databases. The internal SV database (D\u00e9j\u00e0Vu) contained at the beginning of the project 200 Novaseq sequenced genomes from non-ID patients. The number of genomes in D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu is now up to 2000 (mostly ID patients). Ranking of identi ed variations is based on calling quality and inheritance status. For balanced SV (translocation and inversion)a greater weight is given to variations whose break points arefound in OMIM genes. After ltering CNV already detected at least 10 times in the D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu database, all detected CNV are analyzed using standardcriteria [ACMG recommendations ( Riggs et al., 2020 )]. For D\u00e9j\u00e0Vu count, two CNV are considered identical if they overlap over 75% of their reciprocal length. For balanced SV (translocationand inversion), break points must have an identical genomicposition \u00b150bp. All imbalanced and balanced SV are checked in IGV software by visualizing paired read alignment anomalies (insert size, pairorientation and split read). In addition, for CNV, allele frequencyplots ranked according to chromosomal positions are alsoavailable. Biological Interpretation Biological interpretation follows standard criteria [ACMGrecommendations ( Richards et al., 2015 ;Riggs et al., 2020 )]. Briefly, balanced and imbalanced SV and SNV/Indel/Small exonic deletions, or duplications are all performed by two independent biologists. All variations are checked on. bam data and doubtful variations are con rmed using standard molecular analysis before biological analysis (less than 10mutated reads for SNV, doubtful de novo status, doubtful deletion, duplication or translocation/inversion ...). For CNV (duplication, deletion), current cytogenetic is performed based on DGV, inheritance mode, recurrency, andgene contents. For balanced SV, only variations disrupting aknown ID gene are retained for interpretation. Small SNV/indelare analyzed following mendelian modes of transmission ( de novo AD or X linked variations, transmitted AD variation in case of known incomplete penetrance or suspected parental mosaic, maternally X transmission in male homozygous orcompound heterozygous variations approach ensuresthat mutations (expected in about 5% of cases) willbe identi ed (Yang et al., 2014 ). Variants of interest are then recorded in the e-CRF and discussed during the MDM. Multidisciplinary Meeting Each MDM includes clinician geneticists from the recruiting center, clinicians in charge of the patients 'follow-up (i.e., neuropediatricians, neurologists, pediatricians, etc.),molecular and chromosomal geneticists (from the referencelaboratory and its mirror laboratory). To ensure a reasonablenumber of cases to be reviewed by each MDM, three independentMDMs are organized in parallel, each of them grouping twolaboratories and four clinical centers. Each MDM will thus reviewabout 400 inclusions. In order to ensure consistency in decision-making between MDMs, all positive cases from the three MDMswill be validated in a general DEFIDIAG study review meeting. Each MDM is organized according to the following format: discussion of the list of variants of interest obtained by the simplex 44GPS analysis; then by GSS analysis (for the 196randomized patients); and nally, by GST. At each step, additional con rmation analysis that would be required in the course of standard care (Sanger, qPCR, FISH, analysis on mRNA,etc.) is recorded on the MDM report and in the e-CRF, for furthermedico-economic evaluation. The nal conclusion concerning the pathogenicity of variant(s) identi ed by the different approaches will be reached during the session and recorded in Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 766964 8Binquet et al. DeDiag Study Protocolthe e-CRF MDM conclusion. If additional con rmation methods are required, the reference laboratory will be in charge of thisanalysis and the case will subsequently be reviewed in a futureMDM. The nal results are recorded in a research report communicated to the clinical geneticist who included the index case. Candidate genes or variations (new genes, or putative variations with no obvious pathogenic effect in known genes)are classi ed as class 3, of unknown signi cance until the end of the project. Potential reclassi cation will be managed using standard care procedures such as splice effect, epigeneticsignature, functional studies, and cohorts of patients usinginternational collaboration. GS Results Visit and Subsequent 12 months Follow-Up When the results become available, and regardless of the results (positive or negative), the clinical geneticist who included thepatient (and parents) will inform patient/family about the resultsof the GS during a dedicated visit. These results will be madeavailable approximately 9 months after inclusion in the study. Ifthe study identi es one or several class 3+, 4, or 5 variation(s), the clinical geneticist will explain the type of associated medicalcondition, its mode of inheritance and the risk of recurrencefor a future pregnancy, as well as the modalities of care. Allinformation (examinations, medical or non-medical treatment, medico-social follow-up, etc.) will be collected by the geneticist, assisted by a CRT. The diary kept by the families will be retrievedand integrated into the e-CRF. A new diary will be given to thefamily for the subsequent 12 months, and the phone contact bythe CRT is planned. If the parents or adult with mild ID agreed toparticipate in the qualitative study, the sociologist/psychologistwill then contact them to check that they all still agree to continuethe interviews and organize the second interview. Twelve months after the GS results are made known to the patient, a nal visit at the hospital will be organized (this visit can be replaced by a telephone contact, if necessary) to assess the medical condition, collect any results and retrieve the diary. If the parents agreed to participate in the qualitative study, once again,the sociologist/psychologist will then contact them to check thatthey all still agree to continue the interviews and organize thethird interview. Medico-Economic Evaluation A cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted over the estimated9-12 months (maximum) required to perform the GS, interpret the data and return the results to the patient. Ef cacy will correspond to the diagnostic yield of each of the three strategies being compared. In order to estimate costs from the perspective of the health service, patient management will bedivided into three main periods of healthcare consumption(Figure 2 ). The costs in the medico-economic evaluation will be direct costs, corresponding to medical procedures carried outduring period 2. They will include: 1) the costs of consultationwith the clinical geneticist in the recruitment centers, 2) the costsof exams preceding the genetic analysis and inclusion in theDEFIDIAG project, and the cost associated with the rst bloodsample and its transport, 3) the costs associated with any new blood draws required; 4) the costs of genetic analyses, and 5) thecosts of any additional and con rmatory tests. Most of these procedures will be valued using social security prices, except for GSS and GST, which will be valued using a micro-costing method (Drummond et al., 2005 ). Impact Studies Two impact studies will be conducted: the cost of the diagnostic odyssey will rst be estimated. It will include the cost of all diagnostic procedures from the rst genetics consultation, to inclusion in the DEFIDIAG project (period 1 of Figure 1 ). The impact of genomic analyses on follow-up will also beassessed. It will be based on a before-after study (period 3compared to period 1) and will include treatment and diet as well as rehabilitation, psychological and medico-social follow-up. Data Management and Data Analyses Data Management Clinical and paraclinical data as well as the results of the genetic analyses carried out will be entered directly into the dedicatede-CRF by the investigators, helped by CRTs and by biologists andbioinformatics specialists in charge of the GS analyses. Thepatient diary speci c to microcosting and patient follow-up are in paper or electronic format (forms independent of thee-CRF). Each patient is identi ed by a unique code including: the number of the recruiting center, the inclusion rank, the initials of the patient ( rst letter of surname and rst letter of rst name) and a code corresponding to his/her sex. The use of theCleanWEB software makes it possible to carry out checks formissing and incoherent data, and to generate queries immediatelyafter data entry. Requests for corrections may also be generatedby the CIC-EC1432 and sent to the recruiting center and/or thereference laboratory. The corrections will be made directly in thee-CRF by the investigators and/or the biologists, assisted by theCRTs. Histories of changes are systematically recorded. A datamanagement plan, speci c to the study, integrating centralized monitoring (enabling, for example, comparative monitoring of the distribution of subpopulations between centers and indicatorsof the quality of sample processing) was prepared before initiatingthe study in the participating centers. Statistical Analyses The percentage of ID causal diagnosis identi ed will be compared between strategies (GST vs reference strategy) using a McNemartest in the overall rst-investigation population, then in the seven subgroups of interest. To account for multiple testing, theunilateral alpha risk is set at 0.00278, and also for the secondary comparisons of the diagnostic yield of GST vs. GSS, which will be performed in the dedicated randomized subgroup. McNemar tests (unilateral alpha risk set at 0.025) will also be used to compare the percentage of causal diagnoses identi ed by GS and reference strategies in the sub-groups of the individualscoming for a rst genetic referral without major non-cerebral abnormality or without epilepsy. This test will also be used in theoverall population ( rst-investigation patients and previously investigated patients) to compare the percentage of causal Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 766964 9Binquet et al. DeDiag Study Protocoldiagnoses identi ed by GS strategies in patients with negative CMA. The percentage of causal structural changes identi ed by GST vs the reference minimal strategy will also be comparedusing McNemar tests in the rst-investigation population ( rstly considered all together, and then strati ed by subgroups). The number and type of consistent and divergent variants identi ed with CMA and GS strategies will also be described. The frequencyand characteristics of the situations where the causal diagnosis isidenti ed by the reference strategy but not by the GS analyses will be described, as well as the frequency and characteristics ofsituations where the causal diagnostic is made by GSS and notby GST. Cost-Effectiveness Study The cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed in the population of randomized patients coming for a rst genetic referral and for whom both GS strategies are performed inaddition to the reference minimal strategy (i.e., 196 patients).The analysis will be based on the estimation of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios expressed in terms of cost per additionalpositive diagnosis. Deterministic analysis will take account ofprogress in technology. In order to manage the uncertaintyassociated with sampling, a non-parametric bootstrap analysiswill be performed. Impact Studies The costs of nding a diagnosis will be described only in the population of patients who had previously had geneticinvestigations (50% of the 1,275 index cases), as the mean andstandard deviation, if normally distributed, or as median andinterquartile range otherwise. The analysis of the impact of genomic analysis on medical, medico-social, rehabilitation and psychological follow-up afterthe results are made known, will be performed separately in thepreviously-explored population (50% of the 1,275 index cases) onthe one hand, and in the population attending for a rst genetics investigation on the other hand (never-explored patients). Frequencies of follow-up changes between the period prior to inclusion and the period following the results will be calculatedwith associated 95% con dence intervals. A global analysis will then be performed, regardless of the results of GST. Sub-analyseswill be conducted according to the result of GST: positive,negative or uncertain. Qualitative Study The analysis of the interviews will be based on the following steps:1) open coding of transcribed interviews, to identify as manytopics as possible in the initial corpus; 2) categorization of codes; careful re-reading of the corpus as a whole will be performed to clearly de ne each category; 3) linking categories and writing of detailed memos and designing explanatory diagrams; 4)integration of the previous steps to identify the key points ofthe phenomenon; 5) theorization: meticulous and exhaustiveconstruction of the \"multidimensionality \"and \"multicausality \" of the phenomenon of the relationships between needs,expectations and hopes, suffering, and the result of geneticanalysis. For the psychological aspects, the interviews will beanalyzed using the general inductive method ( Thomas, 2006 ), which encompasses the rst 3 steps mentioned above. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The study sponsor is the Institut National de la Sant\u00e9 Et de la Recherche M\u00e9dicale (INSERM). DEFIDIAG study was supportedby The French Ministry of Health in the framework of Frenchinitiative for genomic medicine ( AVIESAN, 2016 ). An independent international scienti c advisory board was constituted in order to make recommendations about the protocol and to evaluate and oversee the scienti c and ethical integrity of the study. It is also tasked with evaluating potentialsub-study proposals. The Ethics Committee Sud M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Iapproved the protocol in June 2019 (under the number 1955/19.05.29.60442). Authorization for detaining nominativedatabases was granted in March 2020 by the French dataprivacy commission (Commission Nationale de l 'Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s, CNIL, reference number: 919361). with ClinicalTrials.gov under the identi er NCT04154891 in November 2019. The rst patient was included in March 2020 and the study is expected to be completed by 2023. We anticipate that the DEFIDIAG study will demonstrate an increase in performance of genetic testing performance inpatients (children and adults) affected with ID of unknownetiology. This study will bene t the patient and the family, because it will identify a diagnosis, in turn providing thefamily with an explanation for the clinical condition, whichwill at last have a name (heralding the end of their diagnosticodyssey). Finding a diagnosis will enable initiation of appropriatemedical therapy and ad hoc care if available, and help in theorganization of follow up for the patient, prevent unnecessary medical biological and imaging investigations, authorize reproductive counseling for patient and/or family (prenataldiagnosis, preimplantation diagnosis), enable referral to ad hocpatient and support groups, and contribute to research protocols.Indeed, future perspectives include numerous research projectsthrough the data collected concerning genotype-phenotypeanalyses, biological integrative analysis of pathways involved inbrain development and functioning and last but not least, mayhelp in the elaboration of targeted therapies. In addition, it is expected that the cost-effectiveness and impact studies will show the ef ciency of GST and also the cost-saving and the change in medical practice that can be expected from its implementation. To the best of our knowledge, no data has been published in France on the economic and medical impact of GScompared to the reference strategy or between trio and solo strategies.These arguments are essential to support the decision to implementthe appropriate rst line GS strategy in diagnostic routine practice, to help public health authorities to d etermine an adequate tariff with regard to the complete cost of GS, and also to demonstrate the impactof GS on improving patient care. Speci cally, we believe it is important to determine the ef ciency of a solo strategy, which is less costly in terms of sequencing, but also more pragmatic in manysituations where biological relatives are not readily available. Frontiers in Genetics | www.frontiersin.org February 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 766964 10Binquet et al. DeDiag Study ProtocolHowever, it is potentially more time consuming to interpret than trio sequencing data. Comparing thes e two strategies from a medico- economic point of view therefore seems important. We made someimportant choices concerning the methodology of data collection. The completion of the DEFIDIAG study should enable the key stakeholders to decide on the implementation of GS in France as therst-line test in the care of patients with ID. It will help us to con rm the robustness of the results obtained with traditional data collectionby providing GS diagnostic yield estimates in conditions close toroutine. DATASHARING All requests for the study 's data will be considered by the De diag trial steering committee. After the end of the study; and forparticipants who provide consent, data (excluding datacorresponding to the image capture) will be transmitted toand stored at the \"CAD \"(Collecteur Analyseur de Donn\u00e9es) of French initiative medicine ( AVIESAN, 2016 ), for potential re-use by other researchers including those notinvolved in the present study. The conditions for CAD datasharing are being implemented. TRIAL STATUS Recruitment is ongoing (955 patients included as of 09/06/2021).
