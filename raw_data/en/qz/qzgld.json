He was 76. The Carellfamily name is virtually synonymous with caringabout children and families\u2014including children withautism and other developmental disorders served bythe Vanderbilt Kennedy Center. \"Monroe Carell was a man of great heart and spirit who understood the strengths of families at the sametime that he understood the need to support families whose children are challenged by illness or disability,\" said Pat Levitt, Ph.D.,Vanderbilt Kennedy Center director. \"His gifts to the Vanderbilt Kennedy Centerfunded workshops for families of young children with autism and allowed us toserve additional children and families in TRIAD autism clinics. The Carrellssupported innovative research through the Ann and Monroe Carell PretermCare and Diagnosis Discovery Grant. His legacy will continue in many ways.\" Monroe Carell, Jr.The numbers are staggering. We come into contact with an average of 500 manufactured chemicals every day, have over200 synthetic compounds in our bodies, andthe paucity of testing of these compounds iscause for alarm among both parents andscientists. The numbers strike home when putinto the context of a report from the NationalAcademy of Sciences, which reported that 3%of all neurobehavioral problems in children aredirectly caused by a chemical exposure and25% are caused by environmental exposureinteracting with a genetic trigger. Faced with these numbers, the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) hosted a day-long intensive examination of these issueson Earth Day, April 22. VKC patrons Dan and Claire Marino sponsored thesymposium titled \"Environment and Autism Etiology.\" Symposium chair BethAnn McLaughlin, Ph.D., assistant professor of neurology, summarized the impetus to organize this meeting: \"The publicoperates under the assumption that chemicals used in agriculture, industry, andin our households have been rigorously tested and have been deemed safe bygovernment regulatory agencies. In truth, only a few thousand of the over80,000 compounds registered for use in the U.S. have been tested. For the vastmajority, their safety is not known, and children, before and after birth, areenormously vulnerable to even small amounts of compounds that candetrimentally affect the course of development.\" Marinos Thank VKC and Community Champions Dan and Claire Marino came to Vanderbilt on a mission. For the last 3 years,the Marinos have sponsored VKC research on autism spectrum disorders (ASD)under the umbrella of the Marino Autism Research Institute (MARI). TheirVanderbilt visit provided the opportunity for the family to see the impact oftheir investment, galvanize VKC researchers and a national gathering ofinvestigators, and thank other VKC patrons (see p. 11). The NFL Football Hall of Fame quarterback and his wife Claire began their visit with a tour of cellular and molecular neurobiology research labs.They visited with McLaughlin, Daniel Campbell, Ph.D., Kathie Eagleson,Ph.D., and members of research groups working with Pat Levitt, Ph.D., and McLaughlin. Jeannette Stankowski, a neuroscience student in the McLaughlin lab, was one of many awestruck scientists in the group. \"It was tremendously excitingto see this incredibly famous family come to see what we were working on,\"Stankowski said. \"We all spend so much time working in lab, and to see howexcited they were by our work was inspirational.\"\"Iwant to challenge us to think differently about where the field of disability isgoing,\" Timothy Shriver, Ph.D., said. Shriver leads the worldwide Special Olympics movement,which has 3 million athletes and1.3 million coaches andvolunteers taking part in 182countries. During his visit to theVanderbilt Kennedy Center onApril 1, he met with VanderbiltMedical Center leaders and thenspoke to a rapt audience at theVKC Celebration of CommunityPartners, \"Growing T ogether,\" as he shared his life's work and passion. Introducing Shriver, Elisabeth Dykens, Ph.D., VKC Associate Director, praised Shriver for his \"leadership in novel Special Olympics programs to promotepositive attitudes toward people with disabilities, to train athlete leaders, to buildinclusive international disability public policies, Moving From Need to Value By Jan Rosemergy Number 21 Summer 2008 Vanderbilt UniversitySusan on page 2Continued on page 3GERLINDE PHOTOGRAPHY, MICHAEL HOPKINS TOMMY LAWSONThe Environment & Autism By Jan Rosemergy Timothy Shriver receiving gift of photograph by Matthew DrumrightDan Marino COURTESY OF MONROE CARELL JR.

It is the Marino's vision of excellence,collaboration, and information sharing that has setthe standard of today's program.\" Dan Marino in his welcome said, \"I love seeing the passion you have for what you're doing. We allshare the common goal of making a difference forfamilies affected by autism. Research is the next stepto making an impact on the lives of children withautism and their families.\" The symposium covered a wide range of possible toxicological factors, including pesticides, metals,organic pollutants, viruses, bacteria and otherinfections, pharmaceuticals, and food additives. Theevent is available via webcast at www.kc.vanderbilt.edu.Brief highlights are summarized below. Clinical and Behavioral Aspects The symposium opened with an overview of clinicaland behavioral aspects of ASD by Peter Mundy,Ph.D. (Education, University of California-Davis).He reviewed the changes in diagnostic criteria andscreening that have occurred over the last severaldecades, which contribute to the difficulty inaccurately determining the extent of the rise in ASD prevalence. \"The essence [of ASD] hinges on attentional function,\" Mundy said. taken us a long time todefine the social phenotype of autism, and we haveto tie our biological, genetic, or epidemiologicalscience to that, to try to link the biological processesto what we are coming to understand are thecardinal behavioral symptoms of the disorders.\" If the increase in prevalence is related to changes in diagnostic criteria, one would expect to seeprevalence increases not just in younger children\u2014who would be most vulnerable to newenvironmental factors\u2014but also in older children,Mundy argued. He indicated that more epidemiologicstudies are needed to address that question. A recent provocative finding, Mundy said, are two studies in different parts of the country followingchildren in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) thatshowed an increase in ASD prevalence in infantsstressed by low birth weight. Anotherepidemiological factor appears to be more years of higher education in parents. As prevalence is increasing, there are proportionately more children with ASD withoutintellectual disability than in the past. \"If biology orenvironment is driving ASD, why is it driving it inthe higher functioning children?\" Mundy asked. Genetics of ASD James Sutcliffe, Ph.D. (Molecular Physiology &Biophysics, Vanderbilt) stressed the substantial genetic component in ASD etiology, describing it as\"enormously complicated.\" Sutcliffe explained,\"Different genes contribute to susceptibility, anddifferent constellations of genes in different families\u2014not causing ASD but conferring additional risk.\" Sutcliffe discussed work from his group using large groups of patients to identify genetic\"susceptibility\" factors or candidate genes that maycause ASD or greatly increase the chance that, underas yet to be defined environmental agents or otherinfluences, cause one to be at high risk of developingASD. Sutcliffe described for the nongeneticists howgenome-wide linkage screens, genome-wideassociation studies, and candidate gene studies allowresearchers to find common genes associated with ASD risk. Other approaches Sutcliffe described included mapping chromosomal translocations andinversion breakpoints, and copy number variations.Of particular recent is the idea that genescontrolling neural development and transmissionmay be associated with ASD, which are active areasof research for his group. Genes and Neurobiology \"Brain biology is altered early on,\" said Pat Levitt, Ph.D. (Pharmacology, Vanderbilt), as he reviewedevidence that included accelerated brain growth inthe first 9-12 months and increases in the size ofwhite matter. \"There's an early maturing and then aflattening,\" he said. Reviewing a list of genetic syndromes that co-occur with ASD, he pointed out that what they allhave in common is \"a disruption of [brain]connectivity.\" Illustrating the complexity, he pointedout that as many as 14,000 genes are active at thepoint of synapse between brain neurons. Levitt focused on findings in genetic research that he has conducted, with Daniel Campbell, Ph.D., andcolleagues, involving the MET gene, which isexpressed in forebrain circuitry and is related togastrointestinal function, a system often disrupted inASD. \"Changes in brain development and the GIsystem travel together,\" Levitt said. \"Is the MET signaling pathway a convergent node in ASD?\" heasked, pointing out that MET signaling affects thedevelopment of multiple biological systems: centralnervous system, peripheral nervous system,gastrointestinal system, and the immune system.Signaling of genes other than MET, includingPLAUR and SERPINE1, is involved. \"Somecombination of genes causes vulnerability to maternaland environmental factors,\" Levitt summarized. Epidemiology of ASD \"Derived from the Greek, meaning 'what is upon the people,' population approaches are critical todefinitions of epidemiology,\" said Craig Newschaffer,Ph.D. (Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Drexel University). Newschaffer contrasted descriptive versus analytic studies. The latter includeshypothesis-driven studies grounded in some a priori evidence, as well as exploratory analytic studies. Hethen provided an overview of basic epidemiologicdesigns relating ASD and environmental factors,noting strengths and weaknesses of each. Ecologic studies involve a correlation between group-level exposure data and group-level outcomedata. They do not consider individual-level data andindividual subjects. Studies correlating childhoodvaccines and ASD are ecologic studies. \"Thesestudies tend to be exploratory, and you have to usecaution when you're interpreting these group-levelstudies,\" Newschaffer warned. \"They are importantstudies, they can generate ideas, but as causalevidence, we need to interpret them with caution.\" As an example of a case control study, Newschaffer cited a recent study on pesticideexposure linking a database of agriculture pesticidesused in California counties to the mother'sgeographic location during pregnancy. This studyfound a higher incidence of ASD when motherswere exposed in the first trimester. Other currentstudies include the Center for Disease Control'sSEED\u2014Study to Explore Early Development, a 5-year, multisite collaborativeEnvironment & Autism from page 1Summer 2008 Discovery MARI directors, MARI Symposium presenters, and Dan Marino Foundation leaders\u2014(left to right, seated) Craig Newschaffer, Wendy Stone, Isaac Pessah, Darryl Hood, BethAnn McLaughlin, Mark Noble (left to right, standing) Irva Hertz-Picciotto, James Sutcliffe, Michael Aschner, Pat Levitt, Claire Marino, Dan Marino, Mary Partin, Daniel Messinger, Theodore Slotkin, Peter Mundy, Michael AlessandriGERLINDE PHOTOGRAPHY, MICHAEL HOPKINS 2Continued on page 7 Director's Message Summer 2008 Discovery to foster family support networks, and to promote athlete health and wellness through large-scale health screenings.\" Healthy Athletes Shriver focused on the need for improved healthcare, in this country and worldwide, for individualswith intellectual disabilities when he met withVMC physicians, administrators, and facultyresponsible for medical education. He emphasizedthe new Special Olympics, which is now a global movement that uses sports to change attitudes andbehavior, and which bridges service, research, andsocial change. Healthy Athletes screenings at the 1995 Games demonstrated significant untreated health anddental problems. These disparities in health carewere further confirmed by the U.S. SurgeonGeneral's 2002 report, Closing the Gap: A National Blueprint to Improve the Health of Persons withMental Retardation . The Healthy Athletes program has had significant impact. There are programs in 85countries. Over 650,000screenings have beendone. Over newpatients intellectualdisabilities. data fromscreenings in 159countries are available foranalysis in collaborationwith universities. Shriver called on health care professionals anduniversity researchers to address the pressing healthcare needs. \"We need to rethink the curriculum of health care professionals, so that they are prepared toserve persons with intellectual and otherdevelopmental disabilities,\" he said. \"Significantchanges are needed in insurance andreimbursement policies to enable improved accessto health care.\" \"The Search for Value\" As the featured speaker for the Center's Celebrationof Community Partners, Shriver addressed anaudience of over 100 individuals with disabilities andfamily members, disability advocates, and VKCfaculty and staff involved in community outreach. Shriver made his points by telling stories of change. The Opening Ceremony of the 1995 WorldSpecial Olympics was the first ever attended by a U.S.President. A professional photographer taking photos of President Clinton in the distance saw a group ofSpecial Olympians holding their disposable camerasup\u2014but with the lens toward their own faces.Concerned that they did not know how to takephotos, he explained the need to turn the camera,lens outward. They thanked him\u2014and thenexplained that the lens functions like magnifyingbinoculars when one looks through it. \"I like that story,\" Shriver said, \"because it frames expectations and changes in expectations. Thephotographer's assumption was about incompetence.Who was the most changed person on the field thatday? That photographer changed just as much as theathletes. It's that kind of change we need to thinkabout as community partners and as scholars.\" Shriver readily acknowledged the substantial progress of the last several decades focused oninclusion, social justice, services and supports,education and IDEA, ADA, housing, employment,and more. \"But this is about social justice and need,\" Shriver pointed out. \"It's not so much about the value of individuals with intellectual or other disabilities.\" Shriver characterized the care of individuals with intellectual disabilities in many places around theworld as \"simply criminal,\" and indicated that national and international agencies are not addressing this population. He showed findings of areview of national data systems in 12 countriesworldwide to illustrate the disparity between thelarge number of national data systems trackingindicators of well-being for the typical populationand the far smaller number of national data systemstracking indicators for persons with disabilities, andfewer yet for those with intellectual disabilities. \"If you have no problem identified, you have no solution identified,\" Shriver said. \"Y ou have no gapbetween what's ideal and what's real. And so you do nothing.\" Every individual has weaknesses, every individual has strengths, Shriver stressed. \"But we don't talkabout strengths in this field as much as we ought to.We don't talk about the absolute benefit of being acolleague, a friend, a brother, a sister, a father, amother, a team mate of aMoving From Need to Value from page 1 Last fall, the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) launched a strategic planning process that included more than 50 faculty, staff, andcommunity partners. Four main groups emerged:Message to Leadership; Balance Collaboration andCommunication. Far-reaching recommendationswere made that will sharpen the mission of the VKC. The Message to Leadership Committee helped us realize how complex we are. With so manyongoing research, training, and service activities, itis difficult to keep up. The group developed awonderful strategy of providing monthly one-pagesynopses to the senior leadership of the Universityin the form of VKC Notables . Each synopsis highlights three elements that comprise our ownVision 20/20 \u2014multilevel partnerships,empowering the community, and best practices.This new way of communicating to leadershipillustrates not only the growing humandevelopment and disability research portfolioacross campus, but also our emerging influence inother areas, including policy, clinical service, and training. The goal of the Balance Committee is to achieve a seamless integration of research, service, andtraining in half of our activities by 2013. This is achallenging task, because these activities typicallyoccur in academic silos. However, our faculty, staff,and community partners are developing specificgoals and timelines to garner the space and intra-and extramural resources needed to meet ourtrifold mission. The Membership Committee had a difficult task of defining the meaning of VKC membership forfaculty. One recommendation was clear\u2014thecommitment by the VKC for promoting theintellectual atmosphere on behalf of facultyengaged in research, service, and training relevantto our mission must be met with a reciprocalcommitment to the VKC. Input is being soughtbefore enacting recommendations regardingadministrative structure and function. Finally, VKC members will incorporate 21st- century ways of communicating, with each otherand with colleagues and the community, the vastarray of scientific knowledge that accumulates on adaily basis. The Collaboration andCommunication Committee was visionary in itsrecommendations to provide the best in tools and infrastructure. We have grown into a truly unique multidisciplinary center. Any great venture needs awell-honed plan, with input from stakeholders. Wehope all of you will be part of our efforts to set thefuture of human development and disabilityresearch, service, and training for generations to come.

Receiving a college education that leads tothe securing of employment is anopportunity every person should have.Historically, individuals with intellectualdisabilities have not had manypostsecondary education opportunities.However, as science and as self-determination help to improve thequality of life and skills of these individuals,the college experience becomes a moredesirable option, and the need for programsbecomes more apparent. The T ennessee Task Force for Postsecondary Education for Students WithIntellectual Disabilities was formed in May2007 to increase awareness about the need forpostsecondary opportunities in T ennessee, togather information about postsecondary programsin other states, and to develop a pilot program on aT ennessee college campus. The task force iscomposed of representatives from State and localagencies, self-advocates and family members,representatives from colleges and universities inT ennessee, and business owners who are potentialemployers for these individuals. \"This Task Force will effectively plan and implement steps to begin programs in T ennesseethat will meet the needs of today's secondary schoolstudents who have an intellectual disability andwho are seeking a postsecondary education,\" saidWanda Willis, executive director of the T ennesseeCouncil on Developmental Disabilities. \"There areseveral complex areas of discussion that the TaskForce has tackled, including eligibility criteria for apilot program, and the risk of unintendedsegregation of students with disabilities by creatinga special college-based program. Open andthoughtful discussion of these and other issues helpto clarify and firm up goals and desired outcomesfor postsecondary programs in T ennessee.\" Approximately 120 postsecondary programs for individuals with intellectual disabilities exist acrossthe nation. Some are 2-year or 4-year degreeprograms, while others issue certificates forcompletion of a course of study. Some offerindividual courses for credit, and others offerauditing courses as the sole option. Currently, thereare no postsecondary programs on a college campus for students with intellectual disabilities in T ennessee. Gathering Information The members of the Task Force have investigated andexplored many postsecondary programs across theUnited States. One such program is Pathway atUniversity of California, Los Angeles Extension.Pathway is a 2-year certificate program thatemphasizes educational enrichment, careerexploration and work readiness, life skills, andtransition to independent living through its research-based curriculum. In 2007, Pathway had 17 studentsenrolled, 16 of whom requested housing in theprogram's dormitory. All were between the ages of 18and 25 and had completed a high school program. Interested students enroll in the program and go through a typical university application process. Theyalso are required to interview, as are their parent(s),and to undergo an independent living skillsassessment. The program has no public funding, andout-of-state tuition applies. Outcome measures arecompetency-based and are constructed around thestudents' strengths. Courses support the developmentof these competencies, and students leave with acomprehensive portfolio and a college certificate. \"The Task Force has looked at many postsecondary programs,\" said Sheila Moore, theexecutive director of the Down SyndromeAssociation of Middle T ennessee. \"All have pros andcons. It is our hope that by holding conversationswith representatives from existing programs, we canlearn what has worked and what has not. As wecontinue to work toward developing theseopportunities in T ennessee, we must not lose sight ofthe fact that our work is fueled by individuals withintellectual disabilities who want the sameopportunities as their siblings and their typically developing peers. They want to livein the community, be meaningfullyemployed, and have their dreams come true.\" Developing a Pilot Program on a Tennessee College Campus \"Both individuals with disabilities and thepostsecondary institutions have much togain by developing these programs,\" saidGarret Westlake, coordinator of DisabilityServices at Volunteer State CommunityCollege. \"Individuals with disabilities whoattend college gain the opportunity toimprove their academic, social, andvocational skills. These are the sameopportunities that any student gains byattending college. Nearly all colleges and universities across this country stress the importance of diversity as well as the values ofteaching and learning in their mission statements.By accepting and educating students withdisabilities who have unique talents andpersonalities, and who have a strong desire to learn,colleges and universities are simply fulfilling theirmissions. It is a win-win situation.\" While the structure of the program still is in question, the mission of the Task Force is to create aprogram that provides meaningful collegeexperiences that also may lead to a greater variety ofcareer opportunities. It is a fact that a college degreeaffords more job opportunities. For individuals withintellectual disabilities this may be doubly so. \"Individuals with disabilities need every competitive advantage in the job market that theycan gain,\" said Andrea Cooper, assistantcommissioner of the T ennessee Division ofRehabilitation Services. \"This is especially true withthe unfortunate attitudinal barriers that exist inmany workplaces. We see a lot of success at thecommunity college level in developing job skills thatcan be applied directly and immediately at work.Making college opportunities accessible toindividuals with intellectual disabilities makes a lotof sense in helping these individuals be competitivein the employment market.\" Members are eager to see a planning grant awarded to a T ennessee college or university in thecoming year.

Some may be hypersensitive and avoidstimulation, while others may seek extra stimulation. Mark Wallace, Ph.D., a neuroscientist who studies multisensory processing, and Wendy Stone, Ph.D., apsychologist who studies the diagnosis andtreatment of autism, have teamed up to comparemultisensory processing in children with ASD and inchildren who are typically developing. Wallace isassociate professor of hearing & speech sciences andpsychology, and Stone is professor of pediatrics andpsychology. Their project is funded by a NicholasHobbs Discovery Grant. Multisensory Processing T o understand the basic processesof perception, scientists havefocused on each sensory system,and today much is known abouthow the brain processes visualstimuli, auditory stimuli, and tactile (touch) stimuli\u2014but largelyas separate systems. \"If we think about how we perceive the world, it's in amultisensory way,\" Wallaceexplained. \"How does the gap inour knowledge.\" Initially, Wallace investigated multisensory processing byfocusing on information encoding\u2014how individual neurons in the brainencode information from different senses, and howthis encoding is changed when stimuli occur incombination, e.g., a visual cue with an auditory cue. \"My goal was to relate this understanding of basic multisensory processes to human perception, andnow we're doing this in more of a clinical context,\"Wallace said. \"What kinds of neurodevelopmentaldisabilities might have a basis in sensory processing,or even in multisensory processing? When I beganreading the research literature on autism, I foundnumerous reports of disturbances in sensoryprocessing but little concrete empirical evidence.\" Current Study Over the years, Wallace and colleagues havedeveloped a battery of basic tests to assessmultisensory perception. Now Wallace and Stone,with graduate students Leslie Dowell and JenniferFoss-Feig, are using these tests to comparemultisensory processing in 10 children with ASDand 10 who are typically developing. Children range in age between 8 and 17 years. One important way of examining multisensory functioning is to focus on temporal processing. \"If avisual event and an auditory event happen within a certain window of time, the brain strives to unify thetwo events. If the two events happen outside that window of time, the brain signals that they are notrelated,\" Wallace explained. \"Our hypothesis wasthat if persons with ASD have a longer temporalwindow than those who are typically developing,their brains may 'bind' unrelated visual and auditoryinformation, resulting in altered sens ory perception.\" Wallace's lab has focused on defining the basic characteristics of this temporal window. In their experiments, they use simple, low-level stimuliconsisting of flashes of light and tone bursts. Thetests are simple so that they can be used with brainimaging to identify brain areas involved inmultisensory processing, and so that they can beused in young children and in clinical populations. Flash-Beep Illusion . In this test, participants sit in a quiet room viewing a computer screen and areasked to press one of two buttons to indicatewhether they perceived one or two flashes of light. Inone condition, the single flash of light is paired withone beep; in the other condition, the single flash oflight is paired with two beeps. If the time intervalbetween the flash and beeps is short enough, theparticipant has the illusion of seeing two flasheswhen two beeps are heard. \"It shows that auditory cues have a strong ability to drive visual perception,\" Wallace said. \"Whenthere is more time between the two beeps and thesingle light flash, the illusion falls apart, and theparticipant recognizes that there was only a single flash.\" When Wallace's team compared the performance of children with ASD and typically developingchildren, they found that the children with ASDcontinued to perceive the illusory flashes over much longer temporal intervals than the comparison group. T emporal Order Judgment . A second task involves a judgment in temporal order in whichparticipants indicate which of two lights appearsfirst. If the two visual stimuli occur at long intervals,participants are good at the task. As the time interval decreases, performance worsens untilfinally it is at chance, \"because we'vesurpassed the ability of the visualsystem to distinguish between the twostimuli,\" Wallace explained. Whenauditory cues are added to the visualpairings, with a specific temporalstructure, performance improves. Forpersons with ASD, the window of timeduring which they receive the benefit from the auditory cues issignificantly enlarged. Findings . Preliminary data indicate that the multisensory temporalwindow may be almost twice as longin children with ASD compared withchildren who are typically developing.\"That is a very exciting finding,\" Wallace said, \"because it provides anempirical foundation for suggesting that a core set of sensory and multisensory processing deficits may contribute to the complex constellation of behaviors seen in individuals with ASD. The effectsare robust, and we're seeing them in several differenttest paradigms.\" Next Steps Wallace and Stone are continuing the multisensory testing with additional children. T o provide a moresocially relevant task, they will add a multisensoryspeech-related task in which perception is againdependent on the temporal window. Finally, theyplan to conduct the tasks in combination with brain imaging. \"Our ultimate goals are to develop more sensitive diagnostic tools,\" Wallace indicated, \"and to use whatwe learn to improve treatment.\" Families of children, ages 8 to 17, typically developing or with a diagnosis of ASD, who areinterested in taking part in these studies can contactJennifer Foss-Feig (615) 936-0265.Autism and Multisensory Processing By Jan Rosemergy TONY MAUPIN Research participants are asked to make judgments about the relative timing and number of visual and auditory events that they perceive.Summer 2008 Discovery DOUG FUCHS, PH.D.

In cohort studies, children are monitored prospectively. \"This maintains temporality inrelationship between exposure and disease, and itoffers us an opportunity to measure those exposuresin real time,\" Newschaffer explained. A disadvantage isthat such studies are expensive and time-consuming toconduct. The National Children's Study, just underway, will follow 100,000 pregnancies, representative ofthe entire U.S., through age 21 and will collectcomprehensive exposure data during pregnancy and inearly life and will track many developmental outcomes,including ASD. Environmental Exposures The latest findings from the CHARGE Study, a case-control epidemiological study being conductedby the University of California-Davis Center Environmental Health, was reviewed byIrva Hertz-Piccioto, Ph.D. (Epidemiology andPreventive Medicine, University of California-Davis).Its goals are to identify causes and contributing riskand protective factors for childhood autism, includinggenetic susceptibility and environmental exposures. The study design has three groups: children with autism, children with developmental delay, andchildren drawn from the general population of births,frequency-matched on age, gender, and geography.Hertz-Piccioto presented findings on Biosciences, University of California-Davis) focused onenvironmental agents in ASD from molecular andtoxicologic perspectives. Pessah emphasized that fewpeople realize that the thousands of commercialchemicals in use, including industrial chemicals, pesticides, ingredients, and food additives, often lack adequate toxicity testing, especially forneurodevelopmental toxicity. Moreover, even for thescant chemicals on which this testing was performed,it is highly likely that, as in any population, someindividuals will be more hypersensitive and others willbe more resistant compared to the typical population.This likelihood would not be reflected in standard testing. \"Could autism represent a multisystem disorder whose outcome is likely to be more profoundlyimpacted by environment than other disorders anddiseases,\" Pessah asked, \"and if so, what are thepossible mechanisms involved?\" He proposed that acommon mechanism in autism susceptibility maystem from abnormal ratios of excitatory/inhibitoryneurons and the networks they form. Many of themost heavily used pesticides alter the balance ofexcitation/inhibition within the developing nervous system. Toxins and Cell Stress BethAnn McLaughlin, Ph.D. (Neurology, Vanderbilt)discussed her work on cellular energetics and howcommon themes have emerged in understandingcellular risks when exposed to stressful circumstances.\"Individual cells are exquisitely sensitive todisturbances in global metabolism,\" she explained,\"which can change cell architecture, cellcommunications, and cell fate.\" Pesticides, herbicides, solvents, and other well-appreciated \"probable toxins\" have a profoundeffect on the cell's ability to make sufficient energy.When this energy is depleted, she explained,communication is sometimes irreversibly damaged.McLaughlin then pointed to recent data from drugcompany screens showing that many prescriptionmedications had profound effects on cellularmetabolism, or \"mitochondrial liability.\" She seesmany parallels between young cells with energeticrequirements and those sheEnvironment & Autism from page 2 Continued on page 9Summer 2008 Discovery For the Susan Gray School (SGS) graduating class of 2008, going to kindergarten is a very popular topic of conversation. \"Kindergarten is gonna to be fun,\" said Johnny, a soon-to-be graduate. \"We're gonna play.\" \"Y eah,\" said Daschell, best friend of Johnny and fellow graduate-to-be. \"Y eah, because Johnny andme, we're going to be the next ones! Know what I'mgoing to do? Know what I'm doing in kindergarten?I'm going to have lots of fun there with Johnny.\" \"Y eah,\" added Johnny. \"We're gonna tell our moms we're going to kindergarten. We never went there before.\" This is just a taste of what SGS preschoolers are thinking when interviewed about what adultsrecognize is one of their first major life transitions\u2014preschool to kindergarten. And some of theirteachers are experiencing wonderful transitions oftheir own. Graduating From Preschool When questioned about what they expect will happen in kindergarten, many of the graduatingstudents predict that they will \"learn more words.\"Several say they have plans to learn how to read andhow to write letters and numbers. Some know howto write their letters and numbers \"good enough\"already and don't expect to learn that at all. Some areexcited to learn how to draw \"different kinds of cars\"that they don't know how to draw at present, andone young lady expressed how wonderful it feels tobe moving to a \"big kid's school\" where her brotheris enrolled and waiting for her. Deep concerns about kindergarten are circulating as well. Many worry there will be \"hard homework\"and \"a million rooms and a million classes.\" Onegraduating preschooler confesses she is nervousabout making new friends. She hopes the peoplearen't mean, because then she will have to be meanback, and she doesn't like being mean. \"Talking about expectations and concerns with children who are transitioning from preschool tokindergarten can be very helpful,\" said MichelleBryant, a teacher at the Susan Gray School. \"Thechildren are dealing with a lot. They are moving to anew place and they will have to adjust to new peergroups and new teachers. They aren't really sure what to expect, and some are anxious about it. If we can talk about the transitioning and answertheir questions, some of their anxieties might be eased. I know inmy heart that the children are readyto transition. My question is for theparents\u2014'Are youready?'\" \"Do you know, I have a video at one of my grandmother's houses, andit gets me ready for kindergarten,\"said Sam, a soon-to-be preschoolgraduate. \"Actually, I got two tapes.It's good. It just makes us do stuff. Itmakes us know what it is. Some onesare very hard.\" Teachers Graduate Too This year two Susan Gray School teachers willgraduate as well. Catina Martinez will graduate witha Bachelor of Science in psychology from T ennesseeState University (TSU), and Suzy Reese has justcompleted her Masters in Early ChildhoodEducation at Peabody College. Martinez started as an intern at SGS in 2004. After her internship was complete, she continued toattend classes at TSU full-time and also beganworking full-time at a car dealership. One day, while at work selling cars, one of Martinez's customers seemed very familiar to her. Martinez soon realized itwas Michelle Wyatt, coordinator of the Susan Gray School. \"Michelle told me they had an opening for a teacher position and that I should apply,\"remembered Martinez. \"I had loved interning thereand was so excited. I interviewed and was hired andstarted the following November. Working therechanged my entire focus in school. When I firststarted taking classes, I had no idea I would want towork with kids with disabilities.\" Martinez is thrilled to be graduating. Working full-time and going to school full-time has meant her\"free time\" has been filled with writing papers andstudying for tests. She is looking forward to the summer and to having three months to relax and\"justwork a full-time job.\" She is thinking about applying to Peabody in the fall and plans to continueworking at Susan Gray School throughout. Suzy Reese began working part-time as an SGS teacher in August 2004 as a part of her graduateassistantship. A full-time student at the time, in Augustof 2005, Suzy decided to change her student status topart-time and to begin working at SGS full-time. \"My parents were not exactly thrilled with the decision,\" remembered Reese. \"They wanted me tofinish school and were a little worried that I mightnot. I admit the first several weeks were exhausting. Iwould go home from work and just crash, but in thelong run it was a great choice. It usually takes peopletwo years to get through the program and it only tookme an extra year and a half. That's not bad. I was ableto gain so much from working in the field I wasstudying, and I broadened my interests in the process.\" Reese began teaching full-time in a classroom for 2-year-olds. It is this class that will be graduating thisyear and going off to kindergarten. \"I am so excited for them,\" said Reese. \"I know I'm going to be crying my eyes out at their graduation. They are such a good group of kids, and I learned as much from them as they learned from me. T o seethem going off to kindergarten after making somuch progress in their own individual ways is great,but I'm going to be sad not to see them in thehallways anymore.\" \"The kids are beautiful,\" added Martinez. \"They love to learn and to teach. They are going to rub offsome of their goodness on all the people they meet.If they can pass on what they have learned hereabout accepting differences, then our world is goingto be a little better.\" Congratulations to the students and the teachers in the graduating classes of 2008.Susan Gray School Graduation By Courtney Taylor 8 TONY MAUPIN TONY MAUPINSummer 2008 Discovery 9studies in neurodegenerative states like stroke. She discussed how clinical and basic tools could bebrought to bear on understanding if adaptiveresponse pathways could augment stressed cells inboth kinds of disorders. McLaughlin also discussedhow contact with families affected by autism whowere relying heavily on dietarysupplements led her to includeASD in her research program.MARI Discovery Grants helpsupport McLaughlin's work. Metals in ASD Results of studies of methylmercury vs. ethylmercury (thimerosal) werereviewed by Michael Aschner, Ph.D.(Pediatrics, Vanderbilt). Two studies performed in the UK examined whether thimerosal invaccines caused neurodevelopmentalor psychological problems (Parker etal., Pediatrics , 2004). Neither found evidence that early exposure tothimerosal was harmful.Thompson et al. ( New England Journal of Medicine , 2007) also found no evidence of neurologicalproblems in children exposed tomercury-containing vaccines orimmune globulins. In a study oftime trends in the prevalence by age and birthcohort of children with autism (1995-2007), wherethe estimated prevalence in children aged 3 to 5years with autism increased for each quarter from1995 through 2007, no evidence was found for arecent decrease in California despite the exclusion ofthimerosal from nearly all childhood vaccines since2001 (Schechter and Grether, Archives of General Psychiatry , 2008). Aschner also reviewed studies that examined metals and ASD. Adams et al. ( Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health , 2007) determined the level of mercury, lead, and zinc in baby teeth ofchildren with ASD. Children with autism hadsignificantly (2.1-fold) higher levels of mercury butsimilar levels of lead and similar levels of zinc.Children with ASD had significantly higher usage oforal antibiotics during their first 12-36 months oflife, and antibiotic use is known to almostcompletely inhibit excretion of mercury due toalteration of gut flora. Kern et al. ( Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health , 2007) examined the difference between sulfhydryl-reactive metals (mercury, lead,arsenic, and cadmium) in the hair of 45 childrenwith ASD (1-6 years) and matched controls. Arsenic,cadmium, and lead were significantly lower in thehair of children with ASD than in matched controls.Mercury also was lower in children with ASD butdid not achieve statistical significance. Aschner and colleagues are conducting a study funded by NIEHS that is based on the hypothesisthat inherited variations in metal transporters or metal clearance genes may render certain individualsmore susceptible to mercury (Hg) toxicity and, inthe context of environmental exposure to Hg, areassociated with ASD. T o date, 64 polymorphisms areidentified. Preliminary data indicate thatpolymorphisms in genes for Hg transport andclearance do not exhibit allele frequencies orgenotype frequencies that differ significantlybetween populations with and without ASD. Cells and Toxicology \"The most important enemies are ignorance and arrogance,\" said Mark Noble, Ph.D. (Genetics,University of Rochester), emphasizing, like others,how much is yet to be known about ASD, inparticular questions about regressive ASD and evenremissions in ASD and whether there may beunifying metabolic disorders in ASD. \"All disease isbased on cellular dysfunction,\" he explained, \"butwhat cells are dysfunctional in ASD?\" He theorizedthat ASD may be caused, at least in part, bydisruption of normal stem and progenitor cellfunction\u2014although this does not mean that autismwould be amenable to stem cell therapies. Many children with ASD are more oxidized than is typical, he indicated, asking whether this might beimportant in pathogenesis. He pointed out that theWorld Health Organization estimates that about 30-40% of the burden of childhood diseases is dueto environmental factors. There are 80,000 to150,000 registered chemicals for which we have noinformation, meaning that these substances areunregulated. \"We each have hundreds of thesechemicals in our bodies,\" he said, \"and we knownothing about combined activities.\" Noble stressedthat many environmental toxicants are potent pro-oxidants. \"We need data, not belief systems,\" he summarized. Toxins and Prenatal Development The developmental effects of benzo[a]pyrene wasthe topic of the presentation by Darryl Hood, Ph.D.(Biological Sciences, Meharry Medical College). Benzo[a]pyrene has been linked to cancers and isfound in a variety of environmental sources,including coal tar, auto exhaust fumes, and tobaccosmoke. Among geneticists, it is known to dysregulateMET temporary developmental expression. Previousresearch demonstrated that exposure duringpregnancy affected early cognitive development. Hood and colleagues are conducting a study, using a rodent animal model, to test the hypothesis that prenatal exposure to thecombustion byproductbenzo[a]pyrene is associated withbehavioral learning and memorydeficits mediated throughdownregulation of developmentalglutamatergic receptor subunitexpression at a time when synapsesare being formed. Hood and hiscolleagues have developed a modelsystem to expose animals prenatallyto toxins and assess the cellular andbehavioral events associated withdiscrete exposure. Ongoing workdescribed by Hood will addresshow the genetic risk factorsassociated with ASD may combinewith environmental factors to\"push the balance into CNSdysfunction.\" Animal Models of Exposure \"Developmental said DukeUniversity). Over 5,000 appearannually. estimates that 25% are neurotoxic,and 67% of high-production chemicals are not testedfor neurotoxicity. The brain is highlyvulnerable, and Slotkin questioned whether increasesin ADHD and other learning and cognitive problemsmay be related to environmental toxins. Presenting a model of how neuroactive agents may disrupt brain development, Slotkin indicatedthat the same neurotransmitter is used for multipledecisions in cell processes. Neuroactive agentsdisrupt neurotransmitter signals that control cellfate, thus disrupting brain development. If thishappens during a critical period of development, it creates a change in cell differentiation that can leadto permanent change in the response to stimulation.If it happens after a critical period, the result is a short-term response that is either reversible or forwhich the cells can compensate. Slotkin traced the effects of two neuroactive agents that have been linked to neurodevelopmentaldeficits in animal models and in humans that mayhave relevance to ASD: organophosphate pesticides,which are widely which is usedin preterm labors. Neurodevelopmental disordershave multiple causes, not a single cause, he argued.\"The origins of ASD may not be so distinct fromother neurodevelopmental disorders.\" See www.kc.vanderbilt.edu for the MARI symposium program, videos of presentations, poster abstracts, and photo gallery.Environment & Autism from page 7 Dan Marino, Daniel Campbell, Ph.D., Claire Marino in Levitt LabGERLINDE PHOTOGRAPHY, MICHAEL HOPKINSKennedy Center Donors Spotlight Summer 2008 Discovery Courage, Networking, and \"The Boss\" DONNA ESKIND By Courtney Taylor \"Iwas raised in a suburb outside of Boston called Brookline,\" said Donna Eskind, Vanderbilt Kennedy Center Leadership Council member andco-chair of the 2008 Nicholas Hobbs SocietyLeadership Dinner. \"I graduated from HarvardCollege and worked in Boston for a number ofyears. I met my husband there when I was 28 yearsold. It was on our second date that he said to me,'Y ou know I'm going back to Nashville when I finishhere.' I told him, 'No, I didn't know that,' and Ididn't. I've been in Nashville for 23 years.\" When Eskind arrived in Nashville, she was 6 months pregnant with her eldest son, David, today aNew Y ork University graduate who will studymedicine at Vanderbilt in Fall 2008. Eskind's middlechild, Matt, a junior at Tulane, is studying businessand is \"loving it.\" \"My daughter, Sarah, is in said Eskind. \"She was attending Currey Ingram Academybut switched schools recently.
