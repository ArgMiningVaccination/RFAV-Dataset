{"title": "Louisa's Natural Therapies - Stress and anxiety... Big topic, and so many of us are suffering from it. The last two years have really taken their toll and I am seeing more clients presenting with anxiety than ever before. If left unchecked stress and anxiety will have a huge impact on your mental, physical and spiritual health and it creeps into every part of our lives. I am very concerned about the increase of children presenting with stress and anxiety and not knowing how to manage it naturally. I am truly grateful to be able to work with people on a one to one basis to support, guide and teach them simple techniques and strategies to reduce stress and anxiety naturally. I have decided to team up with others in the holistic field and to bring to you FREE workshops where you can come along and learn about different ways to reduce stress and anxiety, support your mind, body and soul, boost your immune system and learn some simple techniques and routines to incorporate into your daily life that will make lasting change. Our first guest speaker is a Holistic nurse and health coach with decades of experience and believe me you do not want to miss out on hearing what she has to say. Our first FREE information session will be on Friday 13th May at 6.30pm at Bellbird Park. More details to come. Drop me a comment if you are interested in coming along. | Facebook", "author": null, "url": "https://zh-cn.facebook.com/1013401688870875/photos/a.1013854565492254/2238781299666235/", "hostname": "facebook.com", "description": "Stress and anxiety...
