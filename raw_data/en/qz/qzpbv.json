When we coach patients through natural healing, we refer to cellular detoxification as \"The 5 R's of True Cellular Detox\" or \"5 R's of Cellular Healing\" These 5 R's are the roadmap towards health. As you pass from R1 to R5 your cells will truly have the ability to detoxify naturally and your health will return. R1 - Remove The Source Remove the source is R1 for a reason. This is truly the starting point regardless of how long you have had your condition or how much you have tried to heal yourself in the past. Of all the R's, removing the source (the cause) is the most overlooked aspect by practitioners (alternative or allopathic). Treating symptoms without considering the cause is the main reason Americans are so sick today as medical doctors have fallen into the habit of using medications/surgeries to cover up the source. Alternative doctors use supplements to control symptoms. 98% percent of the time, treatments are simply a Band-Aid, dealing with the effects rather than cause. Although supplements are safer than medications, the outcome is the same, and the methods must be used for a lifetime. When properly identified, the source can be safely removed from the body using the protocols we offer. Most common sources of toxic-ill-health: BPA from plastics - Heavy metals from amalgam fillings (50% mercury by volume) and vaccines (mercury as preservative) - Bio-toxins (mold, mildew, fungus, lyme) - Pesticides from the conventional foods we consume - Electro Magnetic Frequencies: cell phone towers, WiFi and 3G/4G/LTE frequencies. - Pharmaceutical and OTC medications - not only toxic, but now the leading cause of death in the U.S. - surpassing all disease as cause of death Removing these to heal may sound like drastic measures, but this is the only way patients recover. If you don't remove the source, you are never going to get well. Many of you reading this need the proper testing to determine if toxins are playing a role in your diabetes or other illnesses. The following are a few really common toxins that have the potential to do a lot of damage to your health: pesticides, mercury and mold. Pesticides Pesticides have become endemic in our modern society. It's a rather large and corrupt industry\u2014though that might be a conversation for another time. Nevertheless, you are very regularly exposed to it. High levels of exposure can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, eye and skin irritation, abdominal pain and more. However, it's unlikely you are getting such a high dose at once unless you work directly with the chemicals. The long-term effects are much more sobering. Pesticides are carcinogens and are known to lead to several varieties of cancer. It has also been linked to Parkinson's Disease and dementia. It can negatively impact unborn children as they grow and develop in their mother's womb. One way to limit your exposure to pesticides is to only consume fruits and vegetables labeled as pesticide free or organic. If you have a garden or lawn, use natural and organic pesticides. And try not to live too near to any industrial farming operations. Mercury If you've got a filling in your teeth, you've probably got mercury in your system. Fillings are often presented as being cast from precious metals\u2014silver or gold\u2014but it is impossible to actually make anything durable out of these metals without combining them with some other type of metal. Often, that other metal is mercury (among other things). Gold fillings are particularly harmful as they better conduct electricity, causing mercury to leech into your system around ten times faster than fillings made from other types of metal. Mercury in your system affects a sort of triangle of glands and organs in your brain: the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland and the adrenal gland. There are \"mercury free dentists\" out there who are more than happy to safely take out your amalgam fillings and replace them with non-toxic ones. However, mercury poisoning can come from other sources as well: your tap water, canned goods (particularly canned seafood), vaccines and air pollution\u2014particularly if you live near a coal plant or coal-burning facility. Mold Homes infested with mold are surprisingly common. It just happens, especially to older homes in wet climates. Wood, like food, is an organic substance and mold grows on it. Mold contamination is at the root of several ailments, including chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), drastic weight fluctuations and fibromyalgia.In extreme cases, removing mold from your life requires moving to a new home and getting rid of most of your stuff. It may seem dramatic, but it's worth it. Luckily, that's likely not the case. Nevertheless, living a mold-free, toxin free life is of the utmost importance. When you begin removing toxins from your environment, you'll want to move on to removing toxins from your body, and more specifically, your cells. We'll discuss this much more in detail in the remaining \"Rs\" below. However, your cells cannot properly detoxify themselves without a compound called glutathione. Glutathione is the cell's primary antioxidant and its most important compound for neutralizing free radicals (toxins) in the cell. So, once you've determined that you want to heal yourself and you've identified and removed the toxins in your environment, it's time to get your glutathione levels up to optimal levels and move on to the second \"R\": Regenerating the Cell Membrane... R2 - Regenerate The Cell Membrane Once the source is identified and removed (R1), repairing the cell is the next main focus. The cells of your body are made of a soft, bi-layer of fat - the \"cell membrane.\" This membrane acts like a \"gate keeper\" allowing for nutrients to enter into the cell and toxins/ free radicals to leave the cell. If this membrane is inflamed the transfer of nutrients and waste becomes blocked, allowing toxins to accumulate leading to poor cellular health and ultimately organ sickness. The cell membrane also houses hormone receptors, which are responsible for proper cell function. Toxic cell membranes result in poor functioning receptors, which is the main cause of all hormone related disorders (diabetes, weight loss resistance, thyroid conditions, adrenal fatigue, fibromyalgia etc) If you don't regenerate the cell membrane, you will never truly be able to detox the cell and ultimately you will never get well. R3 - Restore Cellular Energy Now that we have removed the source, and repaired the membrane, its time to recharge your cells power source - mitochondrial ATP (energy). Toxic cells have low energy reserves and recharging them requires nutrients to enter the cell. This step is vital, because a low energy cell produces inflammation, damaging the membrane preventing R2 (repairing the membrane). A high-energy cell is naturally anti-inflammatory. Signs of low energy cells are fatigue, brain fog, muscle spasms and pain! Lack of cellular energy is the root cause of many metabolic disorders and yet again practitioners only look to manage symptoms of low cellular energy instead of addressing energy as a fundamental cell function. Our cellular healing diet plan feeds your cells the nutrients it needs to recharge to 100% and stay functioning at that level for optimal healing! R4 - Reducing Inflammation/Oxidative Stress Once the source is removed, membrane is regenerated and cellar energy is restored, cellular function will return and a natural byproduct of a working cell is inflammation and oxidation (consumption of oxygen for energy creation). Inflammation is triggered by 3 main sources: - Overconsumption of refined sugars and grains (wheat/rice etc) - Bad fats and toxins from foods - Cosmetics and cleaning products - Inflammation and oxidative stress destroys normal cell function and prevents healing - the root cause of all disease processes. R5 - Reestablish Methylation Methyl groups and the process of adding methyl groups to toxins (methylation) is how your body regulates genetic expression and identifies and removes toxins safely. Because methyl groups turn on and off stress hormones, almost everyone is deficient in methylation (and therefore unable to detox!) Methyl groups also play a role in protecting DNA from damage and hormone production and utilization. Methylation is the key epigenetic protective mechanism our bodies use to protect us from serious illness. Simply put - without methylation you cannot detoxify the cell or your body and a toxic body is a diseased body. R1-5 summary: If you can't fix the cell, you can't get well.
