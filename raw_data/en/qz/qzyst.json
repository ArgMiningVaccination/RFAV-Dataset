Naringin has become a focus of attention in recent years because of its ability to actively participate in the body's immune response and maintain the integrity of the immune barrier. Aim of the study This review aims to elucidate the mechanism of action and therapeutic efficacy of naringin in a variety of inflammatory diseases and to provide a valuable reference for further research in this field. Materials and methods Literature was searched in electronic databases, including Pubmed, Web of Science, and Elsevier. The search terms were as follows: naringin, bioavailability, signaling pathways, pharmacokinetics, inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular inflammatory diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, renal inflammation, skin inflammation, and joint inflammation. Results The review provided the chemical structure, bioavailability, pharmacological properties, and pharmacokinetics of naringenin and found that naringenin has good therapeutic potential for inflammatory diseases, exerting anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative stress, anti-ulcerative and detoxifying effects in the disease. Moreover, we found that the great advantage of naringenin treatment is that it is safe and can even alleviate the toxic side effects associated with some of the other drugs, which may become a highlight of naringenin research in the future. Conclusion Naringin, an active natural product, plays a significant role in anti-inflammatory and antioxidant regulation of various systemic diseases through a variety of signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms.
