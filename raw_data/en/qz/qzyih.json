They are prescribed to set up the body for yoga practises. They are named shatkarma in view of fact that they are six in number. In short, these techniques are used to clean digestion and excretory system of our body. These systems mean eyes, respiratory system, digestive system and excretory system. If there is any imbalance in these systems of the body, it leads to diseases. Yoga recommends six purification processes to keep the equilibrium in. They are known as Shat kriyas (six purification processes) which are given as under: 1. Kaphalabhati - Purification of frontal lobes and lungs. 2. Trataka - Blinkless gazing. 3. Neti - Nasal cleansing. 4. Dhauti - Cleaning of digestive track and stomach. 5. Nauli - Abdominal massage. 6. Basti - Colon cleaning. The shatkarmas should always be learned and practiced under the supervision of an experienced teacher. Purpose and Significance : To maintain balance between tri-dosh Vata, Pitta and Kapha Improve chemical functioning of the body and mind. Balance prana stream in Ida (left nostril) and Pingala Nadi (right nostril). From that point reviving the course through Sushumna Nadi (both the nostrils). To eliminate toxins from our body. To purify our body from inside and keep our body healthy. Contribute strength to our internal systems like respiratory system, blood circulation, digestive, and immune system. These six cleansing processes are excellent practices designed to purify the whole body, and to get good health.Unit-1 Introduction to Yoga and Yogic Practices-II 1 YogaA. KAPAL BHATI Kapal Means Skull and Bhati means shining. In this practice, the breath is forcefully exhaled through the nostrils by firmly contracting the abdominal muscles after which the inhalation happens naturally. This is repeated 20 times in quick, rhythmic process. This Kriya or cleansing process cleanses the impurity of the Kapal region and makes it shine with purity, so it is called as Kapal Bhati.

It can be performed in two ways: either using a neti pot to purify the passages with salt called Jala Neti, or using a thread passed through the nostrils and out from the mouth called Sutra Neti. TECHNIQUE OF JALA NETI In a feeding cup or a small pot having a nozzle, take tepid water with a little salt added to it. Insert the nozzle in one of the nostrils.

It's purpose is mainly to unleash spiritual and mental powers of an individual. However, in recent times yoga has been extremely popular in context of fighting stress, anxiety and depression in these times of industrialization and super- fast lifestyle. While yoga may look like just a couple of body-bending exercises to the normal eye, a lot goes on under the skin when the limbs are twisted and are left to the breath consciously. Yoga is not just a set of asanas that one performs on the mat, but rather a way of living. With a healthy body and calm mind, one is bound to live a happier and stress- free life. ASANAS: MEANING, PROCEDURE, PRECAUTIONS AND THEIR HEALTH BENEFITS 4 Figure 1.1 (E) Figure 1.1 (F) Central Board of Secondary Education - XIIAsana means a state of being, in which one can remain steady, calm, quiet and comfortable, both physically and mentally. According to the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali \"Sthiram sukham asanam\" means a position which is comfortable and steady. So, it is wrong to say that yoga asanas are practiced to improve the practitioner's ability to sit comfortably in one position for an extended period of time, as it is necessary during meditation. Nowadays, a particular asana is explained in various ways by different teachers that make students confused. Therefore, it is necessary for the practitioners to know why they practice a particular technique. Before we explain the importance of the particular technique for particular asanas, we should first understand the importance of asanas from the point of view of physical health. Human body is made up of various organs and organs are made up of tissues. So, it can be stated that the health of the human body depends on the health of tissues. Physiologically speaking, there are three conditions on which the human body remains healthy. They are - I. Constant supply of adequate nourishment to the endocrine glands and other tissues. II. Effective removal of waste products. III. Proper functioning of all the nerve connections. Cultural poses are fully capable of fulfilling these conditions. (I,II) Elements necessary for the nourishment of tissues are carried to them through blood. This supply of nourishment depends not only on the quality and quantity of the food, but also on the power of digestion and absorption of the digestive system. In that way, the circulatory system and digestive system are interconnected. This system can be kept in a disciplined manner through cultural poses. The smooth muscles of our digestive track need a gentle and automatic massage for proper functioning. When these abdominal muscles become strong and elastic, they can work more effectively. Asanas like Bhujangasana, Salbhasana, Paschimatanasana, Ardha-matsyendrasana, yoga-mudra etc., help to keep our digestive function normal by making the abdominal muscles stronger and more elastic. Asanas keep all the organs in their respective places and help in proper removal of waste products. Human health depends not only on the adequate supply of nourishment but also on the secretions of the endocrine glands. Yogic exercises have been observed to be outstanding exercises for the functioning of the endocrine glands' functions. The most important element for nourishment is oxygen. By practicing asanas, we can keep our respiratory system in a well-organized condition. For proper breathing activity, the health of lungs and the respiratory muscles should be in a good condition. Salbhasana helps to keep them more strong and elastic. The practice of anulom-vilom pranayama helps to improve our lung volume capacity. The third condition of the healthy body is the healthy functioning of the nerve connections. Functioning of all the organs and tissues are regulated by the nervous system. 5 YogaEvery organ and tissue can perform their proper function mainly because of adequate nerve connections. Asanas are found to be capable of preserving the health of the brain and spinal cord. They have beneficial effects on the autonomic as well as the peripheral nervous system which is spread throughout the body. Asanas can be categorized into meditative and cultural poses. Cultural poses can be divided into physical poses and relaxation poses. Practice of yogic asanas, inattentively, may cause several injuries. Therefore, some important points to be kept in mind while performing yogic asanas are as follows: 1. Asanas should not be done by only following books, it should be under the guidance of an experienced teacher. 2. Asanas should not be performed with jerks, but slowly and step by step, gradually up till the final pose on the condition that counter poses are also done. 3. The final posture should be held for some time, but not beyond one's capacity. In case of injuries or illness, the teacher should be consulted and followed. 4. The place should be clean and well ventilated. 5. Always breathe through the nose, unless specific instructions are given to the contrary. 6. Do not practice beyond your capacity. 7. Concentrate on the effects of the asanas on the mind and the body. 8. Shavasana may be performed at any point of time during asana practice, especially when feeling physically and mentally tired. 9. After completing shatkarma, asanas should be performed, followed by pranayamas. Regarding asanas, there are a few aspects that need to be taken care of, such as the perfect time, place, duration of an asana and the condition in which the practice should be done. The aspects that need to be taken care of, are as follows: Time Early morning is the best time for practicing asanas. It should be kept in mind that after taking lunch up to 4 hours, no asanas, mudras or pranayamas should be done. Place Practicing yoga asanas in a well-ventilated place or open air place is recommended. We should avoid artificial air. Duration of asanas It depends on the availability of the time. Normally, a healthy man should practice asanas for 45 minutes every day, and pranayamas for 15 to 20 minutes. If kriyas are to be performed, 30 minutes can be given for them. Restricted conditions 6 Central Board of Secondary Education - XIIYoga After going through a major surgery, one should be advised not to perform asanas within 6 months. One can restart the practice under the guidance of the teacher after 6 months or so, when the affected parts and muscles become strong enough to bear the pressure of the performance. Limitation for women Normally women during first 3 months of pregnancy should avoid all the asanas which create abdominal pressure. During menstruation cycle, they should also avoid all the asanas. TYPES OF ASANAS Various categories of Leg Raise Step-1 Figure 1.2 Figure 1.2 Supine Line Asanas - These prepare you to proceed further in yoga and bring consistency in the development of physical and mental pliability. Examples of such Asanas of Secondary Education - XII Figure 1.2 Figure 1.2 Prone Line Asanas - These bring physical and mental, sharpness and alertness. The postures are the opposite of forward bends as are the effects. In prone line asana, the posterior spine is extended, bringing constituency and mental peace. Such Asanas are Bhujangasana, Salbhasana, Dhanurasana & Naukasana. Sitting Asanas- Sitting upright in supine extending positions, and sadaka help prepare physically and mentally for pranayama. Some of them are Padmasana, Supta Vajrasana, padahastasana step-1 padahastasana step-2 Central Board of Secondary Education - XII Figure 1.2 Figure 1.2 Standing Asanas - Beginners should start with these as they bring elasticity in the joints and muscles, in addition to building up stamina and physical ability. These constitute the most basic of trainings in the early stage of yoga practice. Some basic standing poses 1.2Gyan Mudra Gomukhasana 12 Central Board of Secondary Education - XII Figure 1.2 Figure 1.2NOTE: PROCEDURE AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF EACH ASANAS WILL BE DESCRIBED IN PRACTICAL AND DEMONSTRATION CHAPTER. 1.3 INTRODUCTION OF PRANAYAMA AND DHYANA AND THEIR HEALTH BENEFITS PRANAYAMA MEANING, PROCEDURE, PRECAUTIONS AND BENEFITS Pranayama forms an important component of yogic practice. Pranayama is a science which helps to regularize vital energies through the regulation of breathing. The main purpose of pranayama is to gain control over the autonomous nervous system and mental functions. Pranayama practice involves slow deep inhalation (Puraka), holding breath (Kumbhaka) and near complete exhalation (Rechaka). The flow of Prana or vital energy to all the vital parts of the body is regulated by these breath-regulating practices. Regular practice of pranayama can modulate the sensitivity of chemo-receptors and can also make the mind calm and quiet. These are the pranayama mentioned in the Hatha Yoga Texts. (a) to be practiced. Before doing the above pranayamas, one must follow the essentials for practicing them as stated below: 1. External environment :- Any place that is well- ventilated and free from noise, insects and flies should be preferred to practice pranayamas. 2. Right season to begin the practice of Pranayama : - One should start to practice Pranayama in spring season i.e. March-April and autumn season i.e. Sept- Oct. One who is already in practice should continue its practice. 3. Right time :- Morning is the best suited time to practice Pranayamas. 4. Seat or Asana: - The seat should be soft, thick and comfortable. 5. Asana :- Asanas such as Padamasana, Siddhasana, Vajrasana and Sukhasana are considered the most suitable postures for the practice of pranayama. NOTE: PROCEDURE AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF EACH PRANAYAMA WILL BE DESCRIBED IN PRACTICAL AND DEMONSTRATION CHAPTER. 1.3 ( MEDITATION) DHYANA AND THEIR HEALTH BENEFITS MEDITATION Meditation (Dhyan) is a state of pure consciousness, which transcends the inner and outer senses. Meditation can be an effective form of stress reduction and has the potential to improve quality of life and decrease health care costs. Meditation involves achieving a state of \"thoughtless awareness\" in which the excessive stress producing activity of the mind is neutralized without reducing alertness and effectiveness. Authentic meditation enables one to focus on the present moment rather than dwell on the unchangeable past or undetermined future. Meditation is the art of focusing 100% of your attention in one area. The practice comes with a myriad of well- publicized health benefits including increased concentration, decreased anxiety, and a general feeling of happiness. Although a great number of people try meditation at some point in their lives, a small percentage actually stick with it for the long-term. This is unfortunate, and a possible reason is that many beginners do not begin with a mindset needed to make the practice sustainable. Meditation is an absolutely wonderful practice, but can be very difficult in the beginning. Types of Meditation (Dhyan) Mindfulness Meditation: The most well-known type of meditation, mindfulness meditation, is about being aware of the sounds and activities happening around you. It's almost a flow-like type of meditation, because you just let your mind be fluid and 14 Central Board of Secondary Education - XIIflow from one thought to the next, not really focusing on one particular thing. For instance, if you live in a noisy city, you don't have to block out the outside sirens and screaming children, you let your mind be aware of the sounds without becoming too focused. Spiritual Meditation: This type of meditation is for those who regularly participate in prayer, as it's based on communicating with God. Just like the other styles, you must be calm and quiet and then begin to focus on a question or problem you might have. This style of meditation can not only be relaxing, but rewarding as well. Focused Meditation: If the idea of clearing your mind of all thoughts stresses you out, focused meditation is great because you can focus on a sound, object, mantra, or thought. The key here is to just focus on one of these things and stay committed to that one thought or object. This is when relaxation music comes in handy. Even though you're essentially using your mind, you'll be amazed at how rejuvenated you feel afterwards. In our day to day lives, our minds really are in 10 different places at once! Movement Meditation: Movement meditation may seem intimidating, but if you're by yourself and you really get into it, it can be extremely uplifting and relaxing at the same time. Sitting with your eyes closed, simply focus on your breath and try out different gentle, repetitive flowing movements. Rather than focus on a sound, object, or thought, just turn your attention to your movement. A slow left and right swaying motion can be therapeutic, or you could try moving your entire upper body in a slow circular motion. Mantra Meditation: Mantras are words that are chanted loudly during meditation. It may seems odd to make loud noises during a meditation session, but it's actually the sounds that becomes the object being focused on. In yoga, the mantra Om is regularly used since it delivers a deep vibration that makes it easy for the mind to concentrate on that particular sound. Benefits of Meditation (Dhyan) A feeling of tranquility and freedom in daily life. Reduction in psychological disorders like anxiety, tiredness and depression etc. Relief from various pains, such as headache, joint pains etc. Highly beneficial in insomnia. Increase in patience, and affection and sympathy for others. Growth in devotion and belief in the Supreme Being. A stronger urge and aptitude for service and cooperation in social life. 1.4 Identify career opportunities in Yoga To accredit the students to become competent and committed professionals willing to perform as yoga instructor, yoga teacher, yoga therapist, resource officer in yoga, yoga instructor and naturopathy doctor 15 Yoga To accredit the students to have good health, to practice mental hygiene, to possess emotional stability, to integrate moral values, to attain higher level of consciousness To acquaint students with the theory and practical knowledge of yogasana, Bandhas, Mudras and Pranayama.

Food is fundamental need for everybody to live. Nutrition is essential for sound life. A balanced and nutritious diet routine is important from the onset of life for development and advancement. With regard to younger students, it expects more significance as earlier stages, like youth and puberty are the phases of development and improvement; the requirement of nutrition during these phases of development is definitely more. Balanced and nutritious eating regimen is a fundamental requirement for keeping one healthy. Balanced Diet:- A balanced diet is the one which contains all the elements of food that are needed to keep one healthy. A balanced diet can be divided into two parts: the macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients:- Macronutrients cover principally three components namely carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Carbohydrates and fat provide energy and heat. Proteins are crucial for building of tissues, maintenance of the cellular integrity and functioning of the cells. Micronutrients: The micronutrients comprise of vitamins and minerals. They maintain tissues and regulate functions of the body. They also enhance the utilization of carbohydrates, proteins and fats by the body. Therefore, school children require nutrients in large quantities for maintenance as well as for further growth. Concept of Aahara Shrimadbhagvadgita classifies three types of Yogic Diet The ancient yogis has characterized Aahara into three qualities namely, Sattvic, Rajsic and Tamasic. Each individual has three distinct qualities which are transcendent and decide the nature and likings of an individual. Yogic system categorizes Aahara(diet) into three groups: Sattvic diet: Diet that relates to expansion of lifespan, mental essence, quality, wellbeing and Unit-2 19 Yogacharm, that are tasty, Unctuous, stable, and fulfilling to the heart are the nourishments that are favored by sattvic.\" Sattvic diet is also mentioned as Yogic diet. It is considered as condition in which food occurs naturally and liberated from any added substances or preservatives. Sattvic diet ought to be expended in its normal structure as could be expected under the circumstances, for example raw, steamed or lightly cooked. Sattvic diet contains Whole grains (carbohydrates), pulses, nuts and seeds (proteins), fresh leafy foods (nutrients and minerals), herbs, natural sweetners, for example, honey (in small quantities) etc. Rajasic diet: \"Bitter, sour, salty, excessively hot, pungent, dry, and burning are the foods favored by rajsic, causing discomfort, depression and illness.\" Rajasic things of food ought to be abstained in a yogic eating diet; they include: Caffeinated beverages, for example, tea and coffee, Over processed artificial added substances in food. Hot chilli or anything that can aggravate the mucous membranes, garlic, onion, mushrooms etc. Tamasic diet: Not completely cooked, flavorless, smelly, extra food by others, not fit as a contribution to health is known as tamasic.\" Tamasic diet contains food items which are substantial and cause exhaustion or laziness in a person. Such nourishment is best avoided by individuals experiencing chronic depression. Tamasic diet includes food items like: Red meat, alcohol, spoiled food, overripe or unripe organic products, burnt food, overly processed food sources, fermented food. Basis of yogic Diet Various yogic scriptures identify food items to be as Pathya (wholesome) and Apathya (unwholesome) food and forms basis of Yogic diet. They are discussed below: Apathya/ Un-Wholesome food: The foods which are restricted (for the yogi) are: those which are, sour, bitter, salty, heating, green vegetables (other than those ordained), oil, sesame and mustard, alcohol, fish, flesh foods, curds, buttermilk, oil cakes and garlic. Undesirable eating routine ought not be taken, what is warmed subsequent to getting cold, which is dry (without common oil), which is too much salty or acidic, has too much (blended) vegetables. 20 Central Board of Secondary Education - XII Figure 2.1 (a) Figure 2.1 (b)Pathya/Wholesome food: The most helpful food for the yogi are: acceptable grains, wheat, rice, grain, milk, ghee, sugar sweets (solidified sugar), dry ginger, natural product (types of cucumber), five vegetables and such pulses, and pure water. The yogi should take nourishing and sweet food mixed with, milk and ghee; it ought to sustain the dhatus (basic body constituents) and be satisfying and suitable. Yogic scriptures firmly discourage habit of Over-eating and inspiring moderation of diet . The Indian philosophy says that too much (surplus) of anything is worthless; Yogic literature strongly suggests diet must be taken with some limitation and overeating should be kept away at all cost. Likewise, Higher Yogic practices, for example, meditation and pranayama are done while sitting for extended periods for which light and adequate quantity of any food is relevant. There is no yoga for an individual who eats plenty or who eats nothing for one who is always ready to sleep excessive or one who rises throughout.

Yoga is known to play remarkable role in the improvement of mental health as well as in the treatment and prevention of mental (psychological) health related problems. Patanjali yoga sutras start with the idea of 'cittavrti nirodha' enlighting the importance of controlling the mind. Patanjali yoga sutras highlight the capability of yoga to maintain mental health.

We can begin with these concepts for promotive curative, and preventive aspects in relation to mental wellbeing. Pata\u00f1jali explains about the disturbance of the mind and the development of disease (vyadhi), their symptoms and process to overcome them. [I Chapter, 30th Sutra] says Patanjali. Disease: Mental laziness, doubt, lack of enthusiasm, lethargy, craving for sense- pleasure, false perception, despair caused by failure to concentrate and unsteadiness in concentration Effects on Cittavikshepa Maharshi Patanjali precisely explains the effects of the obstacles on the mental health as pain, (Dukha), depression (Daurmanasya), trembling of the body (Angamejayatva) and, irregular breathing (Shvasprashvasa) are the major symptoms of mental distraction (Cittavikshepa.) 24 Central Board of Secondary Education - XII[I Chapter, 31st Sutra] Developing positive attitudes and feelings for Cittaprasadana Further Maharshi Patanjali suggests a person to inculcate the qualities to achieve a blissful state of mind called Cittaprasadana, By cultivating the right attitude towards different kind of people: Friendliness (ma\u00eetri),toward the happy (Sukha), compassion (Karuna) for the unhappy (Dukha), delight (Mudita) in the virtuous (Punya) and indifference (Upeksha) toward the immoral (Apunya) respectively. Then the mindfull-stuff achieve the Citta prasadana (Blissful and peace of mind). Steps for promoting mental modification of health Yoga practice is being promoted for a high potential for prevention of illness and promotion of health. Kriya Yoga Kriya\"is defined as: practical action, practice, and skill. According to Patanjali, Kriya Yoga is classified into three parts: tapas, swadhyaya, and Ishwarapranidhana. It involves the acts of self purification, self observation and self awareness. Tapas literally means 'to generate heat or energy'. So it means, conservation of heat and energy. In the sense of awakening or stimulating the whole body of our being to higher consciousness. It helps to discipline the mind. It enables the individual to control the urge for materialistic and physical pleasures and thus helps in the attainment of goal. \"Swadhyaya means 'self-study.' This is usually interpreted as the study of the scriptures which deals with the nature of the true Self (spirit) and its realization. Continuous self analysis leads towards awareness of entire structure of one's personality involving physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects. \"Ishwarapranidhana means the offering of one's life to God. It is an important tool to develop the sense of surrendering the ego to the Supreme Being in humility, it is thought that the character of the divine can be attained. Ishwarapranidhana also signifies placing or combining the consciousness completely in inner awareness. 25 Figure 2.3 YogaPatanjali Ashtanga Yoga: Ashtanaga Yoga is a mode of Yoga which consist of Eight Limbs or Steps i.e. Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahar, Dharna, Dhyana and Samadhi have been found to control the mental modification thereby helping in attaining good health. 2.4 Yogic practice of Patanjali yoga: Bahiranga and Antranga Yoga Ashtanga Yoga of Patanjali eight limbs.

Asana (posture): Asana according to Patanjali, is the sitting posture which should be steady and comfortable so the yogi can sit and meditate for long periods of time. 26 Figure 2.4 Figure 2.5 Central Board of Secondary Education - XIIPranayama (breath control): Pranayama, which literally means stretching or expansion of prana, the vital life force, involves breath control and helps train and prepare the mind for dharana (concentration). Pratyahara (sense withdrawal): Through pratyahara one gains the ability to withdraw the senses from their objects thus achieving perfect control over the senses. The pratyahara thus helps in mental and spiritual health of an individual. Antaranga Yoga Dharana (concentration/focus): Dharana involves focusing the mind on a single object of concentration for long periods of time. Thus it is beneficial for psychological and spiritual growth.

Samadhi (total absorption): Finally when even the self-awareness of the mind disappears, and only the object of meditation shines through, it is called the state of samadhi. This leads to enlighten the state of self realization. 2.5 Concept of healthy living in Bhagawat Gita The Bhagavada Gita is a yogic scripture, the description of which is found in the Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata. It includes the knowledge of Indian religion and philosophy. Those who cannot read Vedas, Upanishads. texts, they can get full benefit by reading Gita. The Gita is a book that affects various aspects of life. In difficult times of life, Gita guides a person. The Gita has received worldwide acceptance. The Bhagawat Gita is a Sanskrit text derived from the Mahabharata epic. The Bhagawatgita includes eighteen chapters. The content is in the form of a discussion between Krishna and Arjuna that happened in the middle of war zone of Kurukshetra. Reacting to Arjuna's confusion and puzzle, Krishna explains to Arjuna his duties as a fighter and comments different Yogic and Vedantic philosophies with examples. During this discussion, Krishna declares his identity as the Supreme almighty (God in itself), blesses Arjuna with a glance of his divine universal form, \"Vishvarupa\". The Bhagawatgita is admired/considered as sacred by ancient Indian traditions. It is commonly known as The Gita. The following three types of Yoga in particular have been highlight in the Bhagwatgita: Bhakti Yoga (Yoga for Devotion) is summarized as a mode of worship, which involves of continuous and loving remembrance of God. Karma Yoga(Yoga for Selfless Action), works are done without attachment to the results. It is highlighted by many as the ideal path for Self-realization. 27 Yoga Jnana Yoga (Yoga of Self transcending Knowledge) is a path to achieve the true knowledge about the self. Healthy living in Bhagawat Gita It has been translated into 75 languages of the world. In present times, man is getting trapped in confusion, lies, superstitions and materialism. In the race for industrial progress, a person is becoming distant from his own reality. It has a direct impact on his health. An unhealthy person cannot live life to its full potential. To understand the concept of healthy life according to the Bhagavada Gita, some important facts are indicated, if a person follows them he can lead a healthy life. YOGA MEANS EQUANIMITY: Bhagavad Gita says \"Samatvam Yoga Uchate\" Practice of equanimity of mind for any circumstance without any hatred or greed. Treating all pain or pleasure in same way with love. This type of practice helps one to keep mind constantly tranquil. When mind is peaceful, body functions properly. When equanimity is practiced, fear of disease or fear of death will be thrown away from mind, main causes of disease like jealousy, hatred, anger, will disappear automatically and mind gets quiet. Hence practice of Yoga helps to cure and prevent any disease and keeps you healthy. YOGA IS SKILL IN ACTION: Yogah Karmasu Kausalam: Gita 2.50: Yoga is skill in action. The skill is in maintaining relaxation and awareness in action. Relaxed action is the process. Regular planning in action is an outcome. Thus yoga is skill in action and ability to stay mastery over the mind. \"Yoga is art and science of Healthy Living\" At the point when you practice calmness in mind and are able to concentrate on one thing, you can understand something and takes decisions with its right knowledge at ideal time.

All other developments depend upon it. Physical development relates to structure of the body, height, weight ratio of the body, anatomical and physiological development of all internal and external organs, nervous system, various physiological and general conditions of health. An even greater factor in the maintenance of good health is the food. What we eat effects both our body and mind, our habits and qualities. In short, the food we eat has an effect upon our whole body. Food is the source of our physical energy and vitality. Mental Health Mental health is an important component of overall health and well being. It can be defined as state of psychological and emotional well being in which an individual is able to use learning abilities, can function practically and fruitfully in society and it can meet with the ordinary demands of everyday life.

First aid can be performed by someone with basic medical training or, even untrained person. Everyone should learn CPR properly, and also know how to use an automated external defibrillator (AED). AED is a machine that is used for electric shock in case of cardiac arrest (stopping of heart beat). The AED is usually available at public places/ commercial set-ups like malls, cinema halls and airports etc. The primary aim of first aid is to minimize pain, prevent death or serious injury from worsening. The key objectives of first aid are as follows: 1. The primary objective of first aid is to minimize the pain and save lives. First aid done correctly should help reduce the patient's pain and stabilise the patient. 2. First aid also includes addressing the external factors, such as moving a patient away from any cause of harm or site of accident, away from fire as smoke may cause further choking, and applying first aid techniques to prevent worsening of the condition. 3. It would also include to accelerate the recovery from the illness or injury, and in some cases might involve completing a treatment, such as applying adhesive bandage to a small wound or supporting a broken arm or leg. It is important to note that first aid cannot be compared with the care what a trained medical professional provides. First aid involves making common sense decisions in the best interest of an injured person in an emergency situation. Following (ABCD) points may be noted in the patient during such emergency : 1. Airways : Airways are clear ? 2. Beathing : Respiration is adequately maintained ? 3. Circulation : Any possibility of internal bleeding ? 4. Disability : Difficulty in body functions or, activity limitations ?Unit-3 Yoga for Health Promotion 33 YogaIn such scenario, the following points should be kept in mind and appropriate actions taken accordingly for the benefit of the patient : 1. Is the environment safe for the person? 2. Is the person conscious or unconscious? 3. If the person appears unconscious, tap and talk, shake his/her shoulder and ask loudly (shout) , \"Are you okay?\" 4. Call your local emergency helpline number. 5. Look and listen : See the movements of chest, and try to listen breathing sound 6. Try to feel pulse at neck (carotid artery, one side, not more than 10 seconds) 7. Begin CPR. 8. If an AED is available, deliver one shock as instructed, then begin CPR. CPR Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a life saving procedure. It's very useful where someone's breathing and/or heartbeat has stopped. Nowadays it is expected that everyone should learn CPR. This may save someone's life during emergency. There can be two situations regarding CPR : 1. If you're not trained and not confident about CPR, then provide hands-only CPR. That means chest compressions of 100 times in a minute until medical helps arrive. 2. If you're well-trained, start CPR with 30 chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths (mouth to mouth resuscitation; mask may be used to prevent transmission of infection). CPR can keep oxygenated blood flowing to the brain and other vital organs until more definitive medical treatment restores a normal heart activity. When the heart stops, the lack of oxygenated blood supply can cause brain damage in a few minutes only. A person may die within 5 to 10 minutes. CPR : Compression only (hands-only); C-A-B For adults with cardiac arrest, compression-only (hands-only) CPR involves chest compressions without ventilation support. It is recommended as the method of choice for the untrained person (helper) as it is easier to perform. The recommended order of interventions is chest compressions, airway, breathing (CAB) in most situations, with a compression rate of at least 100 per minute in all groups. Recommended compression depth in adults and children is about 5 cm (2 inches) and in infants it is 4 centimetres. In adults, rescuers should use two hands for the chest compressions, whereas in small children one hand should be used and two fingers (index and middle fingers) should 34 Central Board of Secondary Education - XIIbe used in babies (infants). Compression-only CPR is not as good for children who are more likely to have cardiac arrest from respiratory causes. Both, children and adults, should receive about 100 chest compressions per minute. ABC vs CAB The order of CPR interventions in new-born babies : airway, breathing, chest compressions (ABC) whereas in adults and children : chest compressions, airway, breathing (CAB). CPR : Compressions with rescue breaths Please note this should be tried only if you are well trained in CPR. Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation A universal compression to ventilation ratio of 30:2 is recommended for adults, it means 30 times chest compression followed by 2 rescue breaths, then repeat the same cycle again and again till the medical help arrives. With children, if at least 2 trained rescuers are present a ratio of 15:2 can be maintained. Rescue breaths for children and especially for babies should be relatively gentle. CPR : Method : C-A-B Compressions 1. Put the person on his/her back on a firm surface. 2. Kneel next to the person's neck and shoulders. 3. Place the heel of one hand over the centre of the person's chest, between the nipples. Place your other hand on top of the first hand. Keep your elbows straight and position your shoulders directly above your hands. 4. Use your upper body weight as you push straight down on the chest at least 2 inches (approximately 5 cm). Push hard at a rate of 100 compressions a minute. 5. If you haven't been trained in CPR, continue chest compressions until there are signs of movement or until emergency medical help arrives. If you have been trained in CPR, go on to next step, opening the airway and rescue breathing. CPR method, compression (Source: Wikipedia) 35Figure 3.1 (A) YogaAirway If you're trained in CPR and you've performed 30 chest compressions, open the person's airway. Put your palm on the person's forehead and gently tilt the head back. Then with the other hand, gently lift the chin forward to open the airway. Breathing Rescue breathing can be mouth-to-mouth breathing or mouth-to-nose breathing if the mouth is seriously injured or can't be opened. A mask may be used to prevent transmission of infection. 1. With the airway open, pinch the nostrils shut for mouth-to-mouth breathing and cover the person's mouth with yours, making a seal. 2. Prepare to give two rescue breaths. Thirty chest compressions followed by two rescue breaths is considered one cycle. 3. Resume chest compressions. 4. As soon as an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available, use it while following the instructions. 5. Continue CPR until there are signs of movement or emergency medical help arrives. Mouth to mouth resuscitation (Source: Wikipedia) CPR in children : C-A-B Compressions If you are alone, perform five cycles of compressions and breaths on the child - this should take about two minutes - before calling your local emergency help number and getting the AED, if one is available. 1. Put the child on the back on a firm surface. 2. Kneel next to the child's neck and shoulders. 3. Use two hands, or only one hand if the child is very small, to perform chest compressions. Press straight down on the chest about 2 inches (approximately 36Figure 3.1 (B) Central Board of Secondary Education - XII5 cm). Push hard at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions a minute. 4. If you haven't been trained in CPR, continue chest compressions until there are signs of movement or until emergency medical help arrives. If you have been trained in CPR, go on to next step, opening the airway and rescue breathing. Airway If you're trained in CPR and you've performed 30 chest compressions, open the child's airway. Put your palm on the child's forehead and gently tilt the head back. Then with the other hand, gently lift the chin forward to open the airway. Breathing Use the same compression-breath rate that is used for adults: 30 compressions followed by two breaths. This is one cycle. 1. With the airway open, pinch the nostrils shut for mouth-to-mouth breathing and cover the child's mouth with yours, making a seal. 2. Prepare to give two rescue breaths. Give the first rescue breath - lasting one second - and watch to see if the chest rises. If it does rise, give the second breath. 3. After the two breaths, immediately begin the next cycle of compressions and breaths. If there are two people performing CPR, conduct 15 compressions followed by two breaths. 4. As soon as an AED is available, use it while following the instructions. 5. Continue CPR until the child moves or emergency medical help arrives. 3.2 Yogic Management of Stress and its Consequences CONCEPT OF STRESS Stress is a universal term which is used by anyone or everyone without understanding it properly. Stress is now formalized to mean any change within a system induced by external forces. Medical science defines stress as a specific response of body to all the nonspecific demand i.e., secretions of certain hormones. When a person faces problems in his everyday life which exceeds his resources for coping with them, he feels stressed. Stress is a demand on our adaptability to evoke a response. But we must remember that stress is not just caused by external environment, it can be generated within from our fears, hopes, expectations and beliefs. How modern medical science deals with stress is not our topic of discussion, we are 37 Yogagoing to talk about how yoga can manage stress. It is an accepted fact amongst the world population that 'Yoga' brings happiness, peace of mind and a positive state of health. However, there is a limited understanding regarding the ways in which yoga achieve these things. Actually, yoga aligns with the level body, mind and intellect the by proper knowledge of structure and function, through self-realization and inner awareness. When our resources are over utilized, our exhausted body stops functioning smoothly. The signs that indicate may be physical signs such as high blood pressure , high blood sugar, digestive disorders, back pain, and many others. The Yogic asanas stretch and tone every muscle of the body, joints, spine, the entire skeletal muscles organs, as well as nerves, keeping the entire system in radiant health. By releasing physical and mental tension, a person liberates a vast amount of energy. The yogic breathing practice known as Pranayamas, revitalize the body and help to control the mind, leaving the person calm and refreshed. Relaxation helps control anxiety, hypertension and other discomforts of the mind and body. Definition According to WHO, \" mental Health is a state of well being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully and is able to make a contribution to his or her community\". Types of STRESS A good stress has the following characteristic features it: Motivates Focuses energy Improves performance A bad stress has the following characteristic outcomes: Anxeity Tension Decrease performance Mental and Physical problems CAUSES OF STRESS There may be various reasons for stress. Few of them are listed below: 1) FINANCIAL PROBLEMS According to a survey, money is a significant source of stress. Financial stress 38 Central Board of Secondary Education - XIIcan take months or years to come out from. In the long-term, stress related to finance results in distress, which may bring up blood pressure and cause headaches, upset stomach, chest pain, insomnia, and a general feeling of sickness. Financial stress has also been linked to a number of health problems, including depression, anxiety, skin problems, diabetes, and arthritis. 2) WORK According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people now spend 8 percent more time at work compared to 20 years ago, and about 13 percent of people work a second job. At least 40 percent report their jobs are stressful, and 26 percent report they often feel burned out by their work. Any amount of things can contribute to job stress including too much work, job insecurity, dissatisfaction with a job or career, conflicts with a boss and/or coworkers, etc. Whether worrying about a specific project or feeling unfairly treated, putting jobs ahead of everything else can affect many aspects of life, including personal relationships and mental and physical health. 3) PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS There are people in our lives that cause stress. It could be a family member, an intimate partner, friend, or coworker. Toxic people lurk in all parts of our lives and the stress we experience from these relationships can affect physical and mental health. 4) PARENTING Parents are often faced with busy schedules that include a job, household duties, and raising children which results in parenting stress. High levels of parenting stress can cause a parent to be harsh, negative, and authoritarian in their interactions with children. Parenting stress can also decrease the quality of parent-child relationships. For example, you may not have open communication so your child doesn't come to you for advice or your child and you may argue often. Sources of parenting stress may include lower income, long working hours, single parenting, marital or relationship tensions, or raising a child who has been diagnosed with a behavioral disorder or developmental disability. 5) DAILY LIFE AND BUSY-NESS Day-to-day stressors are our daily inconveniences. They include things like misplacing keys, running late, and forgetting to bring an important item with you when leaving the house. Usually, these are just minor setbacks, but if they become frequent, they become a source of anxiety affecting physical and/or psychological health. 39 Yoga6) PERSONALITY AND RESOURCES Personality traits can be independent sources of stress. Extroverts, for example, tend to experience less stress in daily life and have greater social resources, which buffer against stress. Perfectionists may bring stress onto themselves unnecessarily because of their exacting standards, experiencing more negative mental and physical health consequences than those who merely focus on high achievement. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF STRESS a. Common effects of stress on mood Anxiety, restlessness, lack of motivation or focus, feeling overwhelmed, irritability or anger and sadness or depression b. Common effects of stress on your behavior Overeating or under eating, anger outburst, drug or alcohol abuse, tobacco use and social withdrawal. EFFECTS OF STRESS Stress is a natural, physical and mental reaction to life experiences. Everyone experiences stress time to time; Stress can be beneficial to your health. It can help you cope with potentially serious situations. Our body responds to stress by releasing hormones that increases heart and breathing rates and muscles to respond. Yet if the stress response doesn't stop firing, and these stress levels stay elevated for longer than necessary for survival, it can impact your health. Chronic stress can cause a variety of symptoms and can affect your overall well-being. Some of the effects are discussed below: 1) Respiratory and cardiovascular systems: Stress hormones affect the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. During stress, breathing becomes faster in an effort to quickly distribute oxygen-rich blood to our body. If one already has a breathing problem like asthma or emphysema, stress can make it even harder to breathe. Under stress, the heart pumps faster. Stress hormones can cause the blood vessels to constrict and divert more oxygen to your muscles so that one has more strength to take action. But this also raises the blood pressure. As a result, frequent or chronic stress will make the heart work too hard for too long. When the blood pressure rises, so does the risk of having a stroke or heart attack. 2) Digestive system Under stress, the liver produces extra blood sugar (glucose) to give the body a 40 Central Board of Secondary Education - XIIboost of energy. If under chronic stress, the body may not be able to keep up with this extra glucose surge. Chronic stress may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The rush of hormones, rapid breathing, and increased heart rate can also upset the digestive system where one is more likely to have heartburn or acid reflux. 3) Muscular system The muscles tense up to protect themselves from injury when you're stressed. They tend to release again once you relax, but if you're constantly under stress, the muscles may not get the chance to relax. Tight muscles cause headaches, back and shoulder pain, and body aches. This can set off an unhealthy cycle as you turn to pain medications for relief. 4) Sexuality and reproductive system Stress is exhausting for both, the body and the mind. If stress continues for a long time, a man's testosterone level begins to drop. This interferes with sperm production and can cause erectile dysfunction or impotence. Chronic stress may also increase the risk of infection for male reproductive organs like the prostate and testes. For women, stress can affect the menstrual cycle. It leads to irregular, heavier, or more painful periods. Chronic stress can also magnify the physical symptoms of menopause. 5) Immune system Stress stimulates the immune system, which can be a benefit for immediate situations. This stimulation can help to avoid infections and heal wounds. But over time, stress hormones will weaken the immune system and reduce the body's response to foreign invaders. People under chronic stress are more susceptible to viral illnesses like the flu and the common cold, as well as other infections. Stress can also increase the time it takes for you to recover from an illness or injury. Yogic Management of Stress 1. Om chanting and prayer. 41Figure 3.2 (A) Yoga2. ShodhanaKriyas: Kapalabhati,. 3.

It is the most common nutritional or metabolic disorder. Obesity is a condition in which excess body fat accumulates to such an extent that health may be affected. It is commonly defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30kg/m2 or higher. Obesity, in absolute terms, is an increase of body adipose tissue (fat tissue) mass. Causes A combination of excessive calorie consumption and a sedentary lifestyle are the primary causes of obesity. In a few cases, increased food consumption can be attributed to genetic, medical or psychiatric illness. Excess fat accumulation may be due to imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Some patients may be obese due to the abnormal secretion of the Thyroid gland or due to hereditary causes. Actually, there are no specific causes but factors influencing are: Diet: Consumption of high calorie and low fiber diet. Sedentary Lifestyle: significant role in obesity. Genetics: Polymorphisms in various genes controlling appetite and metabolism may predispose to obesity. Medical and psychiatric illness: Certain physical and mental illness and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase the risk of obesity. Early malnutrition: Malnutrition in early life is believed to play a role in the rising rates of obesity in the developing world. Endocrine changes that occur during periods of malnutrition may promote the storage of fat, once more calories becoming available. Gut Flora: There is an indication that gut flora in obese and lean individuals can affect the individuals' metabolic potential. This apparent alteration of the metabolic potential is believed to confer a greater capacity to harvest energy contributing to obesity. Neurobiological mechanism: Leptin and ghrelin are considered to be complementary in their influence on appetite, with ghrelin produced by the stomach, modeling short-term appetite control. In particular, they, and other appetite related hormones act on the hypothalamus, a region of the brain central to the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. Socio-economic: High socio-economic group. Heredity: Obesity may inherit from parent to child. Endocrine factors: Hypothyroidism, Cushing Syndrome, etc. 52 Central Board of Secondary Education - XIIFaulty metabolism: The person whose rate of metabolism is low, tend to get fat deposited in their body. Psychological factors: Worry, anxiety, fear, feeling of loneliness, dissociation and frustration may stimulate the person to over eat. Water retention: Too much consumption of tea, coffee, aerated water, alcoholic drinks results in deposition of fluid in the body tissues and causes increase in weight. The excessive fat accumulation can be measured through the following means: Some expression of weight in relation to height, especially one to referred to as the body mass index (BMI). A BMI of all round 25kg/m2 is considered normal. Skin fold measurements. Various body circumferences, particularly the ratio of the waist to hip circumference. Yogic Management of Obesity 1.

The levels of Systolic and Diastolic pressure are both risk factors. BP > 140 mmHg. & Diastolic Bp > 90 mmHg are generally accepted as hypertension. Classification of hypertension 1. Primary Hypertension (high blood pressure in the absence of any underlying disease): Benign Hypertension Malignant Hypertension 2. Secondary Hypertension (high pressure due to some underlying disease): Cardiovascular Hypertension Endocrine Hypertension Renal Hypertension Neurogenic Hypertension Pregnancy induced Hypertension Manifestations of Hypertension: Renal Failure Left Ventricular Failure Myocardial Infarction Cerebral Hemorrhage Management of Hypertension I. Dietary Management Maintain a healthy life style by maintaining adequate nutrition. Regularize eating habits by consuming foot at regular intervals of time. Avoid fried foods. Avoid high salt content foods. Sprinkle lemon juice over vegetables instead of table salt. Take foods rich in fibre, like vegetables and fruits such as apples, oranges, carrots, tomatoes, and beans etc. Do not skip a meal. Avoid pickles, chutneys, pappads, etc. which has high salt content. Eat foods rich in antioxidants like Citrus fruits, papaya, tomatoes, grains, cereals, potatoes, green leafy vegetables, etc. Avoid dishes,containing baking powder. 57 YogaII. Yogic Management The role of yoga in the management of hypertension is well documented now. Aim of treatment of hypertension should be to lower the blood pressure and to prevent further complications. In general, the practices prescribed for the hypertension cases are: Kriyas: Jalneti, Sutraneti Surya-namaskara and selected practices of Yoga Om Meditation. Contraindications: The Topsy-turvy postures, hyperventilation breathing practices should be avoided. (C) LOW BACK PAIN Low back pain is the most common cause of job- related disability and a leading contributor to missed work. Fortunately, most occurrences of low back pain go away within a few days. Others take much longer time to resolve or lead to more serious conditions. Chronic back pain is a major cause of social and financial concerns as it is associated with impaired quality of life, loss of productivity and large health care expenses. Acute short- term low back pain generally lasts from a few days to a few weeks. Most acute back pains are mechanical in nature - the result of trauma to the lower back or a disorder such as arthritis. Pain and strain may be caused by sports injury, work around the house or in the garden, or a sudden jerk such as car accident or other stress on spinal bones and tissues. Symptoms: Symptoms may range from muscles ache to shooting or stabbing pain, limited flexibility and/or range of motion or inability to stand straight. Occasionally, pain felt in one part of the body due to disorder or injury, may \"radiate\" elsewhere in the body. Chronic back pain is measured by duration - pain that persists for more than 3 months is considered chronic. It is often progressive and the cause can be difficult to determine. 58 Central Board of Secondary Education - XIICauses of lower back pain: As age advances, bone strength and muscle elasticity and tone tend to decrease. The discs begin to lose fluid and flexibility, which decreases their ability to cushion the vertebrae. Pain can occur when, someone lifts something which is too heavy or over stretches, causing a sprain, strain or spasm in one of the muscles or ligaments in the back. When the nerve roots become compressed or irritated, back pain results. Low back pain may reflect nerve or muscle irritation or bone lesions. Most low back pains follow injury or trauma to the back, but pain may also be caused by degenerative conditions such as arthritis or disc disease, osteoporosis or other bone diseases, viral infections, irritation to joints and discs or congenital abnormalities in the spine, obesity, smoking, weight gain during pregnancy, stress, poor physical condition, improper posture for doing a particular activity and poor sleeping position may also contribute to low back pain. Yogic Management of Low Back Pain 1. Om chanting and prayer 2. Spinal exercise: The simple spinal movements facilitate the practice of a further range of Yogic techniques by loosening the joints and muscles. 3. Sukshma Vyayama: Griva-sakti-vikasaka (Strengthening the Neck) (1, 2 & 3), SkandhatathaBahu- mula-sakti-vikasaka (Developing the strength of the Shoulder- Blades and Joints), Purnabhuja-sakti- vikasaka (Developing the arms) (Exercise B, C, D, E - vikasaka & F), Kati-sakti (strengthening the Back) (1, 2, 3, 4 & Dhyana: Meditation Tips to a healthier back Following any period of prolonged inactivity, begin a program of regular low-impact exercise. Yoga can help to stretch and strengthen muscles and improve posture. Low impact for appropriate exercises age are designed to strengthen lower back and abdominal muscles can help as well. 59 Yoga Always stretch before exercise or other strenuous physical activity. Don't lean when standing or sitting. When standing, keep the weight balanced on the feet. At home or work, make sure the work surface is at a comfortable height. Sit on a chair with good lumber support along with proper position and height for the task. Keep the shoulders straight. Switch sitting positions often and periodically walk around the office, gently stretch muscles to relieve tension. If one must sit for a long period of time, rest the feet on a low stool. Wear comfortable, low-heeled shoes. Sleep on the side to reduce any curve in the spine. Always sleep on a firm surface. Don't try to lift objects too heavy. Keep the objects close to the body. Do not twist when lifting. Maintain proper nutrition and diet to reduce and prevent excessive weight, especially around waistline that taxes lower back muscles. A diet with sufficient daily intake of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D helps to promote proper bone growth. If one smokes, quit smoking. Smoking reduces blood flow to the lower spine and causes the spinal disc to degenerate. Avoid excessive stress. Stress will also contribute to the pain intensity. (D) BRONCHIAL ASTHMA Asthma is a disease of the respiratory system where the airways get narrowed, often in response to a \"trigger\" such as exposure to an allergen, cold air, exercise, or emotional stress. This narrowing causes symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing, which respond to bronchodilators. The asthmatic disorder is a chronic (recurring) inflammatory condition in which the airways develops increased responsiveness to various stimuli, characterized by bronchial hyper-responsiveness, inflammation, increased mucus production and intermittent airway obstruction. Asthma is characterized by episodic, reversible broncho- constriction resulting from increased responsiveness of the trachea-bronchial tree to various stimuli. The exact basis of bronchial hyper reactivity is not entirely clear. But bronchial inflammation plays an important role. Clinical course: Signs and symptoms of Asthma Asthma is characterized by episodic dyspnea (difficulty in breathing), wheezing and cough. Difficulty in expiration. 60 Central Board of Secondary Education - XII Tightness of the chest/discomfort in the chest may be seen. Attack lasts from one to several hours. Severe attacks may affect the heart and circulatory system. Severe attack, not responsive to usual therapy is called \"status asthmaticus\" and is a medical emergency. Hypercarbia (increased level of CO2), acidosis and hypoxia (decreased O2 level) is rare in asthma. Management of Bronchial Asthma I. Dietary management 1. The diet plays an important role in the management of asthma and other respiratory conditions. 2. There are foods which are allergic to asthma patients and such foods should be avoided. 3. Cold foods, ice creams, chocolates, other stimulants, fruits like banana etc. are to be avoided. 4. Also, the foods which add to the production of should be specifically avoided. II. Yogic Management The role of yoga in the management of Bronchial. Asthma is well documented now. Aim of the treatment of asthma should be broncho-constriction and to tackle the triggering factors. 1. Kriyas: Jalaneti, sutraneti, kapalabhati, kunjal, vastradhouti 2.

Yoga falls in many forms, but generally involves positioning the body in various poses along with coordinated breathing and meditation exercises. Clinical course: Signs and symptoms of arthritis Regardless the type of arthritis, the common symptoms for all arthritis disorders include varied levels of pain, swelling, joint stiffness and sometimes a constant ache around joints. Other than this a variety of symptoms can be found such as: Inability to use the hand or walk. Feeling tiredness. Weight loss. Poor sleep. Muscle ache and pain. Tenderness. Difficulty in movement of joints. Yogic Management of Arthritis: 1. Om chanting and prayer 2.

In contemporary psychology, personality has been examined in a few different ways. Psychologists refer personality as qualities and characteristic behavior within an individual. Personality development has several interrelated dimensions namely, physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual. From yogic point of view the person is viewed as a spiritual entity, connecting in the material world, utilizing body/mind as a vehicle. Human being here is seen as an autonomous spiritual consciousness, independent of the body. Yogic philosophy views the person as having five koshas which surround the divine self or the atman. These sheaths, from the outermost to innermost order are known as Annamaya Kosha (physical body), body). Inner shr are related to the higher levels of conscio sness while the outermost shr eath is related to the outward going or lower level of consciousness. Personality Development through Yoga Yoga is considered as an effective tool for development of personality of children. Yoga acts on all five koshas (shr eaths) surrounding the self. Asanas are the tools which mainly influence annamaya kosha by bringing flexibility, relaxation, toning, strength, balance and general fitness. Various researches have revealed that at the pranamaya kosha or the subtle energy level, pranayama restores harmony to the flow of prana (vital force) by removing blocks and imbalances. The manomaya kosha works at two levels, the level of mind and the level of emotion. At the mental level, dharna, dhyana and smadhi facilitate channelization of thoughts and then focus on a single thought leading to the state of super consciousness. At the emotional level, Bhakti Yoga is good for culturing emotion. It gives emotion the right direction for growth. By devotional practices, negative, harsh and violent emotions can be replaced with the positive, soft and gentle emotions. Thus, Dhyan and Bhakti Yoga facilitate the mental and emotional development of the children. Dhyana and Jnana Yoga are helpful to reach the level of higher buddhi. Good intellect, intuition, wisdom, higher knowledge and psychic abilities shine out from the innermost sheath(anandmaya kosha). Love, compassion, joy, accomplishment and mutually fulfilling relationships get evolved from the crude level to a more refined level. This will help to evolve better intra-personal and interpersonal relationships. Ananamaya kosha (bliss body) is the ineffable experience of peace, love and ecstasy from being in contact with the ultimate consiciousness which can be reached by attaining the state of smadhi. 63 YogaYoga for Physical Development Physical growth for an ideal body means proportionate body with all the muscles relaxed in a normal state, all systems and organs of body with least abnormality and absence of ailments. Yogic practices can play positive role in promotion of wellness and in preventing and curing various ailments of the body and in helping the body work more efficiently. Well proportionate body and flexibility in the muscles and parts of the body can be attained with the help of various asanas or postures. Contribution of Yoga to the physical development of personality has been proved time and again. Yoga for Cognitive Development Mental development is the growth and change in cognitive processes such as attention, memory, thinking, perceiving, imagination, reasoning and problem solving. It is a continuous process which continue without any interruption during all the stages of life. Surya Namaskar, Tratak and Pranayama helps to maintain the pineal gland (responsible for development of cerebral faculty) and beneficial for learning, retaining information and memory. Yoga for Emotional Development Emotional development can be considered in terms of control and expression of emotions as well as management of relationships with oneself and others. Stretching exercises, relaxation techniques and pranayams are good tools for conditioning of the autonomic nervous system. These yogic practices have been found to bring significant positive changes in the emotional states of anxiety, stress, depression, regression, fatigue, guilt and arousal. Yoga for Social Development Social development refers to the development of attitude and behavior in relation to others behavior. The process by which attitude and behavior of a child are brought into harmony with other's is called socialization.Yama, Niyama, Pratyahar and Dhyana of Ashtang Yoga are important tools for social development. Yoga for Spiritual Development The texts on Yoga describe the spiritual health as self awareness of one's natural state of contentment. Spiritual development takes place in the form of habit, values, ethics etc. Good habits and a strong value system inculcated right from the childhood will have lasting effects on the personality of a child. Dhyana is a powerful tool for a spiritual growth. Teaching and practice of Yama, Niyama and Meditation (Dhyana) are beneficial for spiritual growth. 64 Central Board of Secondary Education - XIIQUESTION UNIT- 3 TOPIC 3.1 1. What is stress? 2.
