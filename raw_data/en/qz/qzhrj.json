Methods .A study nested within the CVT intention-to-treat coho rt was designed to assess high-risk HPV variant lineage - specic vaccine ef cacy (VE). The 2 main end points were (1) long-term incident infections persisting for 2 years and/or progres- sion to high-grade squamous 2/3]) and (2) incidenttransient infections lasting for <2 years. For ef ciency, incident infections due to HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -45, and -51 resulting in persistent infection and/or CIN 2/3 were matched (ratio, 1:2) to the more-frequent transient viral infections, by HPV type. Variant lineages were determined by sequencing the upstream regulatory region and/or E6 region. Results .VEs against persistent or transient infections with HPV-16, -18, -33, -35, -45, and -51 did not differ signi cantly by vari- ant lineage. As the possible exception, VEs against persistent infection and/or CIN 2/3 due to HPV-31 A/B ( P= .02 for test of equal VE). No difference in VE was observed by variant among transient HPV-31 infections ( P= .68). Conclusions .Overall, sequence variation at the variant level does not appear to explain partial cross-protection by the bivalent HPV vaccine. Keywords. HPV vaccine; with high- risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) causes cervical cancer, a very common female malig-nancy worldwide [ 1]. Although >200 HPV genotypes have been characterized, cervical cancer is associated with a limited set of 12 related types from 5 Alphapapillomavirus species (alpha-5, -6, -7, mately 70% of cervical cancers [ 5] and are targeted by the virus- like particle -based prophylactic HPV vaccines Gardasil and Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium).

Partial cross-protection has been demonstrated in studies using either the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine [ 12], while variable and/or increased rates of infections have been ob- served for HPV-51, -52, and -58 [ 12-14]. Variant lineages are classi ed as viral genomes of a known HPV type with <10% sequence variability [ 15]. Speci c variant lineages show epidemiologic patterns in their distribution andassociations with CIN 2/3 and cancer [ 15,16]. In addition, HPV variants are associated with hosts of common geographic ancestry and are even evident with population movements; thus, not all geographic regions harbor similar variants (or at similarfrequencies) [ 15,17-19]. Whether viral genomic polymor- phisms associated with variant lineages alter infection rates upon vaccination has not been thoroughly evaluated, but this isof interest because variants exhibit differences in natural history and disease risks [ 15,17,20-22].

This study was designed to assess the impact of HPV-16/18 vaccination on incident infection(s) at the viral variant level. This study evaluated the relative vaccine ef cacy (VE) by variant lineage in samples obtained from young women participating inthe Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (CVT), a National Cancer Institute (NCI) -sponsored community-based, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of Cervarix in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. The presentstudy examined the hypothesis that viral variants circulating inGuanacaste were differentially affected by HPV vaccination. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study of viral variants was a nested analysis within the pre-viously reported CVT (clinical trials registration NCT00128661). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in CVT. Institutional review board approval was obtained for theinformed consent forms at both the NCI and in Costa Rica. CVT Study Design The study design and main outcomes have been published pre-viously [ 6,23,24]. Brie fly, the study involved female residents living in Guanacaste and Puntarenas, Costa Rica, with commu-nity-based census recruitment occurring during 2004 -2005. A total of 7466 women aged 18 -25 years were randomly assigned (ratio, 1:1) to receive the HPV-16/18 vaccine, Cervarix, or con-trol (hepatitis A vaccine; Havrix, GSK Biologicals). Prior to vaccination, all women completed a study survey and had a clinical visit; specimens collected prior to randomizationwere classi ed as having been collected at enrollment. Vaccina- tion with 3 doses occurred over 6 months in the majority of women in the CVT; 71.5% of participants received doses withinthe prespeci ed vaccination windows at 0 months (enrollment visit) and 1 month and 6 months after enrollment. A total of 3736 women received Havrix, and 3726 women received Cervarix [ 6]. When the last vaccine dose was administered, at 6 months,women who were sexually active provided a self-collected speci- men for HPV testing [ 23]. Follow-up included annual collection of cervical samples for HPV and cytological testing. Abnormal cytological ndings (dened by shifted clinical visits to a 6-month schedule; if 3 consecutive negative results of cytological tests were obtained,annual visits resumed. Participants were referred to undergocolposcopy for a diagnosis of high-grade atypical squamous cells (cannot exclude HSIL), or glandular abnormalities and for repeat cyto-logical testing of LSIL or HPV-positive ASC-US [ 6,23]. Exfoliated cervical cells were obtained using a Cervex-Brush (Rovers Medical Devices, Oss, the Netherlands) directly appliedto the cervix and eluted into PreservCyt medium (Cytyc, Marl- borough, Massachusetts) for cytological and HPV testing as previously described [ 6]. HPV Variant Study Design Infecting HPV types were selected based upon phylogenetic re- latedness to vaccine types and/or previous evidence for partial protection or observed enhanced susceptibility to infection afterimmunization [ 6,13,26-31]. A total of 7 high-risk HPV evaluated: HPV-16 and HPV-18; HPV-31, -33, HPV-16 the alpha-9 species); HPV-45 (a type in the alpha-7 species related to HPV-18); and HPV-51 (a type from the alpha-5 species) [ 3]. Incident infection(s) were eligible for selection, de ned as an HPV infection that was detected after vaccination and notpresent at either enrollment (time of rst vaccine dose) or the 6-month visit. Infection duration was estimated as the interval between the initial HPV-positive test result and the time of thelast positive HPV test. Long-term/persistent infections were de- ned as incident infection(s) that lasted for >2 years worth of vis- its (ie, >660 days) and/or resulted in a CIN 2/3 diagnosis. Short-term/transient infections were de ned as those lasting <2 years and not associated with CIN 2/3. For ef ciency, all incident per- sistent infections/CIN 2/3 were selected, whereas a random sam- pling of the more abundant incident transient infections matchedby HPV type were selected in a ratio of 2 short-term infections for each long-term infection. Selection for testing was masked to vaccine arm and number of doses administered. Laboratory Characterization of HPV Type -Speci c Variant Lineages The laboratory was blinded to all data except HPV type. Brie fly, DNA was isolated from exfoliated cells, and HPV genomes were assigned to variant lineages by DNA sequence analyses as previ-ously described [ 17,32]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) anal- yses targeted the upstream regulatory region (URR) and/or E6 open reading frame (ORF), because these regions allow classi ca- tion of HPV variant genome lineages that are also correlated withthe major polymorphisms in the L1 and L2 ORFs [ 15,33-35]. Samples for which the URR assay did not yield ampli cation un- derwent the E6 assay. PCR primers and con-ditions are provided in Supplementary Table 1 [17,33,36]. To classify HPV-31 lineages for the extended study, an tional PCR (L1_FG) amplifying a smaller fragment on lineage-speci c sequence differences in a hypervariable region of the L1 encoding the FG surface loop Classi cation of HPV-31 variants by the L1_FG characterized by theURR/E6 assays ( =0 . 9 5 ; Supplementary Table 2 ). Samples characterized by at least 1 HPV-31 variant assay were included in the HPV-31 extended analysis; samples with discordant var-iant results were excluded (n = 9). Thus, there was a difference in the number of HPV-31 infections classi ed as persistent in- fections/CIN 2/3 in the main and extended studies. 940\u0081JID 2016:213 (15 March) \u0081Harari et alDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/213/6/939/2459308 by UCSF Library and Center for Knowledge Management user on 02 July 2020 Statistical Analysis The lineage-speci c VE was calculated for each variant group. All incident persistent infecti ons/CIN 2/3 for the described types and a 2:1 match by type for incident transient infectionswere included in the analysis. Since the total numbers of women at risk for the end points in the 2 vaccine arms (Cer- varix and Havrix) were practically the same for each analysis,we used event counts instead of attack rates. The estimated HPV VE against viral variant lineages for each HPV type was calculated as the ratio of the difference in numbers of var-iant lineage end points obser ved between the Havrix arm and the Cervarix arm, divided by the number of events in the Hav- rix arm. The expected number of events in the Cervarix arm is a bi- nomial variable, and the sample size is equal to the total number of events in the two arms. Noting that the VE is the complement of the ratio of attack rates in the two arms, we transformed theestimates of the proportions and the con dence bounds to ob- tain a corresponding con dence interval (CI) for the VE, using the Clopper -Pearson method [ 37].Additionally, we tested whether the ef cacy of Cervarix var- ied by variant lineages within the same viral type, separately for each end point (ie, persistent infections/CIN 2/3 and transientinfections). The ratio of the attack rates was evaluated by a Pois- son test for rates, using the rateratio.test package in R [ 38]. The null hypothesis of the tests is equal VEs for each viral lineagewithin a given HPV type. HPV-31 Extended Analysis: Sample Selection and Variant Detection To follow-up on a suggestive initial nding in the main analysis, all HPV-31 infections were tested or retested; infections detect- ed within 180 days of enrollment were considered prevalent andused for exploratory analyses. RESULTS The study design is shown in Figure 1. A total of 1106 incident infections were selected for lineage characterization of high-risk HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, and 51 ( Supplementary Table 3 ). Of the 1106 incident HPV infections selected, 842 (76.1%) were successfully characterized for variant lineage Figure 1.

Design of sample selection for analysis of incident HPV infections in a subset of women in the intention-to-treat (ITT) cohort of the CVT. This s tudy was designed to assess whether the HPV vaccine relative efficacy differed for incident type-specific variant infections, using 2 different outcomes: (1) transien t infection and (2) persistent infection and/or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 (CIN 2/3) -associated infection March) \u0081941Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/213/6/939/2459308 by UCSF Library and Center for Knowledge Management user on 02 July 2020 classi cation; 264 infections (23.9%) were excluded either be- cause the sample was unavailable (n = 47) or the PCR reactions failed (n = 217). Of the 842 infections characterized, 284(33.7%) were persistent/CIN 2/3, and 558 (66.3%) were transient. To assess whether differences in type-speci cV Er e s u l t e d from differences in HPV variant lineage infections, the genomes were partially sequenced to classify variant lineages, categorized by infection outcome and vaccine arm, and compared with re-spect to lineage-speci c VE. For vaccine types HPV-16 and HPV-18, there was strong protection upon vaccination, irre- spective of variant lineage or infection duration (Table 1). We next assessed vaccine variant ef cacies for HPV-31, -33, heterogeneity for HPV-33 and HPV-35 limited estimation of VE by lineage. Al- though HPV-45 infections showed cross-protection in the CVT[6], no difference was observed in comparison of lineages A (n = 35) and B (n = 40) for VE among transient infections (P= .52) or persistent infections/CIN 2/3 ( P= .99; Table 1). Incident HPV-51 infections were previously found to be in- creased in the Cervarix arm, compared with the Havrix arm, of the CVT [ 6]. Infection with this relatively common type was due to lineage A variants in 85.2% of cases (n = 150) and due to Bvariants in 14.8% (n = 26); no statistically signi cant differences for VE were observed for either persistent infections/CIN 2/3 (P= .46) or transient infections ( P= .80) by lineage. Lineage A infections were more common in persistent infections/CIN 2/3 after vaccination, whereas lineage B infections were more common in transient infections after vaccination; the interac-tion was not statistically signi cant (Table 1). HPV-31 infections were dichotomized into variant lineages A/B or C, representing the divergence of the lineages from amost recent common ancestor [ 33]. In women who received Cervarix and developed HPV-31 persistent infection/CIN 2/3, VE against HPV-31 variant li neage C infections 86.4% infections (P= .02; Table 1). No signi cant difference was observed for VE against transient HPV-31 infection by variant lineage. Because of the intriguing difference between persistent infec- tions/CIN 2/3 and transient infections due to HPV-31, a post hoc study was performed to test all incident HPV-31 infections(Figure 2). An additional PCR assay was developed to character- ize HPV-31 variant lineages by amplifying and sequencing a small fragment within the L1 FG loop (see \"Materials and Methods \"section). Seventy-four HPV-31 infections (9.2%) that were unampli ed by all 3 HPV-31 variant assays were excluded. To determine whether differences in infection duration mod- ify the effect of vaccination on HPV-31 variants, the number ofHPV-31 positive tests during follow-up was used to categorize infection periods: transient single infections, transient multiple infections, or persistent infections/CIN 2/3 (Table 2 ). The -positive tests detected within the <2-year period. The end point of 2 years for persistent infection was the same as that used in themain study, although the numbers are slightly different, owing to use of an additional assay. The majority of HPV-31 infections (any lineage) were tran- sient, and, among these, no signi cant difference was observed in lineage-speci c VE, whether for single or multiple transient infections (Table 2). As previously observed, persistent infec- tions/CIN 2/3 due to HPV-31 displayed signi cant differences by variant lineage. Incidence of persistent infections/CIN 2/3 due to HPV-31 A/B was similar by vaccine arm (17 infections in the Cervarix arm and 16 in the Havrix arm), resulting in a VEof6.3% (95% CI, .15% to 30.2%), whereas the VE against HPV-31C (4 infections in the Cervarix arm and 25 in the Hav- rix arm) was 84.0% (95% CI, 63.9% -95.5%; P= .017). To determine whether the vaccine in fluenced the natural his- tory of existing HPV-31 infections, we tested 266 infections that were prevalent at the time of vaccination. No lineage-speci c ef- fect on infection duration was observed among the prevalentHPV-31 infections (data not shown). To evaluate an HPV- naive group that should have maximum protection from Cer- varix, we limited the analyses to women who received 3 vaccinedoses and were negative for HPV by PCR and HPV-16/18 sero- logic analysis at baseline. HPV-31 results were similar as report- ed above (13 transient HPV-31 A/B infections in the Cervarixarm and 52 in the Havrix group, with a VE of 75%; 9 and 47 transient HPV-31 C infections, respectively, with a VE of 81%; 3 and 4 persistent infections/CIN 2/3 due to HPV-31 A/B,respectively, with a VE of 25%; and 0 and 5 persistent infections/ CIN 2/3 due to HPV-31 C, respectively, with a VE of 100%). DISCUSSION This study evaluated whether the partial protection against orincreased susceptibility to some high-risk HPV types after ad- ministration of the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine couldbe due to viral type genetic heterogeneity. The evolution of HPV genomes has resulted in the emergence of stable viral variant lineages with highly correlated nucleotide changes across theviral genome [ 15,35]. To determine whether synthetic selective pressure created by the recent introduction of HPV vaccines limits the dispersion of speci c HPV variants, we used speci- mens and data from the ITT cohort of the CVT. We selected HPV types previously shown to be signi cantly protected, par- tially protected, or increased after HPV vaccination in either theCVT [ 6,24] or other studies [ 12]. We chose our end point based on the most important predictors of cancer risk following infec- tion, viral persistence and/or CIN 2/3. We observed moderate- to-high VE against variants of HPV-31 lineage C for bothtransient infections (VE, 61%) and persistent infections/CIN 2/3 (VE, 84%), whereas, lineages A/B showed only partial pro- tection for infections that were transient (VE, 58%) but not for 942\u0081JID 2016:213 (15 March) \u0081Harari et alDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/213/6/939/2459308 by UCSF Library and Center for Knowledge Management user on 02 July 2020 Table 1.

If cor- roborated, this nding could be of clinical importance, since HPV-31 lineages A/B have been observed to more likely leadto development of CIN 3, compared with HPV-31 lineage C [17,22]. We evaluated whether the difference in VE of HPV- 31 A/B lineages for persistent infections/CIN 2/3 might be re-lated to changes in duration of infection, but we did not observe a difference by vaccine arm (data not shown). Thus, it is unlike- ly that the vaccine acts subsequent to acquisition of an HPV-31A/B variant infection to change the natural history and/or duration of these infections [ 39]. In women with no prior evidence of HPV exposure, vaccina- tion and 6,13,27,39]. As reported in the CVT, the bivalent vaccine displayed VE CI, 40% -100%) against related CIN 2/3 in the ATP cohort [ 24], as well as a VE of 49% (95% CI, 38% -58%) in the ITT group [ 6]. A more stringent end point of 2 years for persistence used in the cur- rent variant analysis con rmed a high ef cacy against vaccine- types (HPV-16 and HPV-18) irrespective of variant lineage, maintaining high-type speci c protection. As previously reported in the CVT, VE against the HPV-16/ 18-related types HPV-31, was 44% the ATP and 16% (95% CI, 5% to 32%) in the ITT group for protection against 1-year persistence [ 6]. Analysis by HPV genotype in the ATP revealed that only the closest HPV-16/18 -related ef ca- cy against 6-month and 1-year persistence in the ATP arm of the CVT was signi cant for HPV-31, with a 1-year (95% only 6-monthpersistence 73% (95% CI, 45 to 88) was signi cant [ 6]. We observed no signi cant differences in VE for HPV-45 line- ages A and B (Table 1). HPV-51 1-year persistence was signi cantly increased in the ATP vaccine arm, with a VE of 64% (95% CI, 151% to 8%). lineage B variantswere differentially increased in persistent infections/CIN 2/3 and transient infections, respectively, although VE was not statistically signicantly different by lineage. In contrast, the PATRICIA trial that also used the bivalent HPV-16/18 vaccine observed weak but signicant cross-protection for HPV-51 6-month persistence [13]. The reasons for the differences in VE for HPV-51 variants in this study and the HPV-51 increased incidence between stud-ies could be related to statistical instability due to the limited number of HPV-51 lineage B infections reported here. In a previous report, HPV-31 partial protection was associat- ed with anti -HPV-16 antibody the ability antibody avidity [ 28]. We the number of vaccine doses received by womenwith HPV-31 infections. There were no signi cant differences between the proportion of women receiving 3 versus <3 doses either by HPV-31 variant lineage (ie, A/B vs C) or by outcome,transient infection versus persistent infection/CIN 2/3 (data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that viral titers are related to HPV- 31 variant differences in partial protection for persistentinfection/CIN 2/3. Theoretically, differences in protection ofHPV-31 variants could result from polymorphisms within the L1 sequence that alter conformational epitopes recognized by vaccine-induced antibodies. Based on our previously reporteddata on the heterogeneity of HPV-31 variant complete genome sequences (supplementary gure 2 Ain the article by Chen et al [33]), we noted only 1 consistent L1 amino acid change Figure 2. Expanded study design to assess the relative efficacy of the bivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine against HPV-31 variant infections. Sample s in which HPV-31 was previously detected [ 6] were selected for variant lineage classification, and incident infections were evaluated for lineage-specific vaccine efficacy. A total of 433 incident HPV-31 infections, classified into variant lineages, were evaluated for relative vaccine efficacy, based on infection duration ([1] tran sient infection or [2] persistent infection and/or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3). Prevalent infections (n = 266), defined as HPV-31 detected within 180 days of study enrollment, were excluded in this analysis. Repeats for QC were an additional sample selected from a different time point in 32 women.

HPV-31 C lineage contains an alanine at L1 -267, similar to that seen in HPV-16, as well as the HPV-16 L1 amino acid sequence used in Cervarix (NCBI AAC09292.1) [ plementary Table 4 ). Thus, it is plausible that this genetic var- iation could contribute to HPV-31C lineage being better protected than the A/B lineages, consistent with the enhancedactivity of monoclonal antibody 31.F16 to recognize HPV-31C variant as compared to HPV-31A/B variants [ 45]. Nevertheless, it is not clear why this differential protection was not seen whenusing HPV-31 transient infections as the outcome. It is possible that persistence involves both protection and natural history differences of HPV-31 variants, as HPV-31 lineage C appearsto persist longer than A/B [ 17,47]. The data suggest that VE by lineage for persistent infections/ CIN 2/3 was generally lower than that observed for transient in- fections (eg, for HPV-45 A lineage, VE against transient infectionwas 79%, and VE against persistent infections/CIN 2/3 was 29%). Since the number of events was limited and because this was not an a priori hypothesis, we have not pursued this analysis in detail.It is possible that lower VE in long-term persistent infections was a result of misclassi cation of incident infections that were low- level prevalent infections, as discussed by Malagon et al [ 12]. This study has limitations. The number of infections in each outcome was limited by strati cation on variant lineage. The study was well powered to detect clinically signi cant differenc- es, but it does not rule out variant differences in other popula-tions. Our study did not access rare variations in the viral variant genomes, particularly in the L1 ORF containing the neutralizing epitopes, but evaluated common changes con-served among variant lineages, based on knowledge of the evo- lution and conservation of HPV genetic variations. In conclusion, we tested the hypothesis that HPV variant lineages might explain the partial protection or increased sus- ceptibility to the HPV vaccine. Although we did not nd a con- sistent pattern of variants having differing vaccine ef ciencies, HPV-31 A/B versus C lineages showed differences in the main outcome, persistent infection/CIN 2/3. We are perplexed by these observations, as transient HPV-31 infections showed nodifferences. Based on the knowledge that the vaccine inducesneutralizing antibodies that should affect both persistent infec- tions/CIN 2/3 and acquisition of transient infections, we have no underlying mechanism that can explain these observations.However, data on HPV-31 variant natural history suggest that lineage C tends to be more persistent, whereas, lineages A/B are more associated with CIN 3. These observations are notTable 2.

Complex- ities in viral-host relationships beyond current understandingmight be at play, or there may be random effects of population sampling yielding data that are dif cult to interpret. Neverthe- less, considering the enhanced oncogenicity of HPV-31 A/Blineages, this study requires con rmation or refutation in addi- tional vaccine cohorts to determine whether HPV-31 variants show differential protection by the bivalent vaccine.
