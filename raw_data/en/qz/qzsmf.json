For many years,Eddy had had limited success in achieving healthusing a wide variety of methods, most notably home-opathy and the mind-cure methods of Maine healerPhineas Quimby. The moment of her healing repre-sented a breakthrough not only in her search forhealth but in her understanding of the nature ofreality. The essence of her 1866 discovery, which shecalled Christian Science, was that reality is, in truth,spiritual, and that the material world is only thehuman mind's primitive, distorted view of reality,which she understood as God's kingdom, always athand. Eddy spent the next several years developingan extensive theology and metaphysics to help othersunderstand the implications of her discovery; the firstedition of her magnum opus, Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures , was published in 1875 under the title Science and Health . The metaphysical and theological basis of Christian Science is distinctive; comprehending it can requiretime and careful study. Adherents of Christian Science,called Scientists, are considered \"students\" and areThe Christian Science Tradition Religious Beliefs and Healthcare Decisions Edited by Deborah Abbott Revised by Stephen Gottschalk Contents The Individual and the 5 Patient-Caregiver Relationship Family, Sexuality, and Procreation 6 Genetics 8 Organ and Tissue Transplantation 8 Mental Health 9 Medical Experimentation 9 and Research Death and Dying 10 Special Concerns 11 Part of the \"Religious Traditions and Healthcare Decisions\" handbook series published by the Park Ridge Center for the Study of Health, Faith, and Ethics THEPARKRIDGE CENTERDeborah Abbott, M.P.H., formerly with the Park Ridge Center, is currently affiliated with Georgia State University. Stephen Gottschalk, Ph.D., is a scholar in the field of religious studies, specializing in Christian Science.expected to spend time each day studying the Bible and Science and Health . Through this study, they seek to change their view of realityand to understand more fully the true nature ofGod. One of the major principles of ChristianScience is that because God is not the cause ofsin, sickness, and disharmony, these can be over-come through a deeper understanding of divinetruth. Christian Science teaches that God couldnot create disharmony; therefore, because God isthe creator of all things, it follows that dishar-mony is not in accord with God's will and has noontological reality\u2014however real it seems toconventional human perception. Another majorprinciple is that the miracles of Jesus (includinghis healings, resurrection, and ascension) exem-plify ultimate freedom from the bondage of phys-ical laws and that we, too, should strive to freeourselves from the delusion that mortality andthe suffering it entails are divinely instituted andin consonance with God's will. Jesus' miracles donot represent exceptions to the laws of nature butrather illustrate what can happen when one isable to see the reality of God shining through thedifficulties that only appear to be true. WhenJesus was confronted with a diseased person, forinstance, he did not see the physical appearanceas a fixed reality; rather, he discerned the pres-ence of a spiritual individual perfectly created byGod. The clarity of Jesus' vision brought imme-diate health to the individual. To ChristianScientists, Jesus represents perfect understandingof and harmony with God and therefore stands asthe model for all time. Christian Science, though distinct in many ways, has more links to traditional Christianitythan its critics (and some of its adherents) mayhave supposed. Mrs. Eddy, for example, teachesthat the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are threeaspects or offices of one God, signifying God asFather-Mother; Christ as divine manhood; andthe Holy Comforter as God's sustaining power,which Mrs. Eddy believes has been revealedthrough Christian Science. Christian Science is\"Christian\" in that it grew out of the Christiantradition, relies heavily on the Bible, andupholds Jesus as the Savior and \"Way-shower\"; it has always distinguished itself from othermetaphysical traditions (to which it is oftencompared) by its focus on Christ Jesus and itsChristian roots, and especially by its emphasison the need for redemption. Christian Science is\"scientific\" in that Eddy believed that herdiscovery embodied a truth so real that it couldbe repeatedly verified by anyone willing to prac-tice its \"divine Principle\" according to its fixedrules for demonstration. FUNDAMENTAL BELIEFS CONCERNING HEALTH CARE Christian Scientists believe that all illness and suffering are ultimately illusory. Obviously,Scientists feel sick and experience disease asothers do, but they believe illness results from amistaken view of the nature of reality, indicating aneed for spiritual renewal. One prominentChristian Scientist has framed the issue in thisway: This [understanding] does not deny that within a strictly physical framework of causation, certainconclusions are warranted\u2014for example, that manyinfections have a bacterial origin. And a ChristianScientist would not presume to question the accu-racy from a medical standpoint of a competentdiagnosis. What a Christian Scientist does questionis the physical framework of causation itself . . . Totake a medical analogy, a Christian Scientistregards all forms of disease as symptomatic of anunderlying condition that needs to be healed. Thisis the healing, or spiritual wholeness, that he orshe seeks to effect through prayer. 1 Prayers therefore focus not on the symptom, the sickness, or disease, but rather on the under-lying condition\u2014flawed human perception andestrangement from God. Through their prayersand practices, Christian Scientists hope to alignhuman understanding with God's divine, disease-free reality, thereby restoring spirituality to the 2 THECHRISTIAN SCIENCE TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONShuman spirit and destroying the illusion of disease. A renewed relationship with God is theprimary goal. Physical healing is simply a naturalby-product. Eddy wrote, \"Healing physical sick-ness is the smallest part of Christian Science. Itis only the bugle-call to thought and action, inthe higher range of infinite goodness. Theemphatic purpose of Christian Science is thehealing of sin; and this task, sometimes, may beharder than the cure of disease; because, whilemortals love to sin, they do not love to be sick.\" 2 Despite her view of bodily healing as secondaryto the healing of sin, Eddy still saw it as a vitalpart of Christian salvation. Christian Scienceperiodicals regularly publish dramatic personalaccounts of healing. Since 1900, over 53,900such accounts have been published, mostinvolving physical healing. 3 According to Christian Science, drugs do not have real power; they are effective only insofaras they are supported by general human faith inmaterial cause and effect. \"Certain results,supposed to proceed from drugs, are reallycaused by the faith in them which the falsehuman consciousness is educated to feel.\" 4 Because this faith is fundamentally misguided,the effect can only be temporary. Eddyexplained, \"A hypodermic injection of morphineis administered to a patient, and in twentyminutes the sufferer is quietly asleep. To himthere is no longer any pain. Yet any physician\u2014allopathic, homoeopathic, botanic, eclectic\u2014willtell you that the troublesome material cause isunremoved, and that when the soporific influ-ence of the opium is exhausted, the patient willfind himself in the same pain, unless the beliefwhich occasions the pain has meanwhile beenchanged.\" 5 Christian Scientists and others in need of healing often rely on Christian Science practi-tioners, professionals who are committed to theministry of healing. This ministry involvesconsultation with the sick, discussion ofChristian Science principles, and prayer. Inaddition to treating physical ailments, practi-tioners often treat alcoholism, anxiety, stress,family difficulties, and other such problems. All practitioners listed in Christian Science periodi-cals have undergone an intensive two-weekcourse of training and are committed to full-time ministry. Consultation with a practitioneroften occurs over the telephone, and he or shenormally receives a modest fee. Christian Science nurses complement the work of practitioners with nonmedical physicalcare. They provide spiritual support; feed provideother nonmedical care. Especially important istheir mission of maintaining a mental atmo-sphere conducive to spiritual healing. ChristianScience nurses do not receive any informationabout medication or physical therapy as part oftheir training. (See \"Pain control and palliativecare,\" below.) More than thirty Christian Science nursing homes and sanatoria are located in the UnitedStates and Canada. Most major health insurancecompanies cover the cost of Christian Sciencecare, including practitioners' fees; unreimbursedpayments are deductible as medical expenses forthe purposes of federal income tax assessment. 6 Among Scientists, sole reliance on Christian Science treatment is clearly preferred over theuse of medicine and medical treatments,although individual Christian Scientists arepermitted to decide for themselves which kind of care they receive. Christian Science teaches,however, that while both medicine and ChristianScience seek the healing of the patient, they reston very different bases and are therefore incom-patible with each other in practical situations. It makes little sense, Scientists believe, to admin-ister medical treatment to a patient while at thesame time denying the ultimate reality of matterand the reality of material cause and effect,which is the basis of medical treatment. Therefore, the two methods should not be used simultaneously\u2014not to satisfy some stan-dard of \"purity,\" but for the welfare of thepatient. If anyone under Christian Science treat-ment chooses to seek medical treatment, the 3 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERpractitioner will discontinue work on the case, although he or she may still visit or pray for thepatient in a general way. If a practitioner choosesto seek medical care personally, the practitionermust temporarily remove his or her name frompractitioner listings. The strong tradition of rejecting modern medicine does not apply in all situations.Christian Scientists regularly engage the serv-ices of medical professionals under certaincircumstances, most notably in childbirth. ManyScientists either give birth in a hospital orarrange to have a doctor or certified midwife inattendance at home births; if complicationsarise, Scientists may accept a variety of drugs orother medical treatments, including cesareansections. Eddy recommended medical oversightof labor following a widely publicized 1888incident in which a mother and child diedwhile under the care of a Christian Sciencepractitioner, who was, in this case, the motherof the patient; Eddy held that the practitionerhad not taken the requisite medical training tohandle the case professionally. Other situationsin which Christian Scientists commonly interactwith health officials and professionals includereceiving legally required vaccines (unless legalexemption is available), obeying public healthlaws involving quarantines and the reporting ofinfectious and communicable diseases, partici-pating in mandatory physical exams, and usingthe services of dentists; many employ doctors toset bones and will use narcotics to quell severepain long enough to apply Christian Sciencemethods. 7With respect to surgery and the setting of bones Eddy wrote, \"Until the advancing ageadmits the efficacy and supremacy of Mind [i.e.,accepts Christian Science], it is better forChristian Scientists to leave surgery and theadjustment of broken bones and dislocations tothe fingers of a surgeon, while the mentalhealer confines himself chiefly to mental recon-struction and to the prevention of inflammation.Christian Science is always the most skillfulsurgeon, but surgery is the branch of its healingwhich will be last acknowledged.\" 8In practice, although many Christian Scientists allowmedical professionals to set broken bones orextract teeth, Scientists commonly reject surgeryin favor of treatment by Christian Scienceprayer. Scientists believe that eventuallyChristian Science principles will become widelyaccepted and traditional medicine will becomemore spiritually and less physically based. INSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY AND INDIVIDUAL CONSCIENCE Christian Scientists believe that individuals must determine for themselves what theybelieve and practice. Those who choose tocommit themselves to Christian Science areexpected to learn and practice the teachings ofthe church as explained in the ChristianScience textbook Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures . (See \"Clergy, worship, and polity,\" below.) 4 THECHRISTIAN SCIENCE TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSMedical professionals should treat Christian Scientists with the same respect accorded to other patients, recognizingthat they are less likely than other patients tobe medically informed, to accept medicalassumptions, or to accept medical treatments.Caregivers should also recognize that medicaland hospital surroundings are unfamiliar tomost Christian Scientists, and this unfamil-iarity may in itself be disturbing to the patientand affect his case. When caring for ChristianScientists, medical professionals should sharerelevant medical knowledge, offer appropriatemedical options and advice, and give Scientiststhe opportunity to decide how to proceed withtheir own care. CLINICAL ISSUES Self-determination and informed consent With respect to medical treatment, each individual is allowed to decide whether andwhen to seek medical treatment, although solereliance on prayer is clearly preferred amongScientists. In lieu of giving informed consent totreatment, many will sign a waiver of medicaltreatment absolving the physician or healthcareinstitution of responsibility for the consequencesof nontreatment. Truth-telling and confidentiality In the context of its teachings, Christian Scienceuses the word \"truth\" to refer to spiritual reality;the physical world, being a limited percept, isnot truly real. Therefore, the \"truths\" of diseaseand medicine, while they may appear to beabsolutely real, proceed from an ultimately erro-neous and limited view of reality. Sickness is part of the error which Truth casts out. Error will not expel error. Christian Science is thelaw of Truth, which heals the sick on the basis ofthe one Mind or God. It can heal in no other way, since the human, mortal mind so-called is not ahealer, but causes the belief in disease. Then comes the question, how do drugs, hygiene, and animal magnetism heal? It may be affirmedthat they do not heal, but only relieve sufferingtemporarily, exchanging one disease for another.We classify disease as error, which nothing butTruth or Mind can heal, and this Mind must bedivine, not human. Mind transcends all otherpower, and will ultimately supersede all othermeans in healing. 9 According to Christian Science, medical science rests on assumed truths which areprofoundly challenged by the \"truths\" of theultimately spiritual nature of man and themental basis of disease, as portrayed in ChristianScience. Therefore, clinicians should be particu-larly sensitive to the issue of truth-telling wheninteracting with Christian Scientists; clinicianand patient should find and maintain an under-standing about what level of discourse is appro-priate for both parties. For example, cliniciansshould be aware that when Scientists forgoChristian Science treatment to seek medicalcare, their attitudes about their physical condi-tion may differ significantly from their attitudeswhen they interact with clinicians for reasonscommonly accepted among Christian Scientists,such as childbirth or the setting of brokenbones. (See \"Fundamental beliefs concerninghealth care,\" above.) Christian Scientists respect the confidential nature of medical records. Proxy decision making and advance directives Christian Scientists may or may not execute advance directives. By their commitment toChristian Science, they indicate a preferencefor Christian Science treatment over medicaltreatment. 5 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERTHE INDIVIDUAL AND THE PATIENT -CAREGIVER RELATIONSHIPFor Christian Scientists, marriage is the legally and morally appropriate context for procre- ation, but it is a human institution rather than adivine one. No marriages are performed by thechurch; Eddy stipulated that Scientists shouldbe married by clergy from other denominations.She believed that, in a marriage, \"separationnever should take place, and it never would, ifboth husband and wife were genuine ChristianScientists.\" 10Although the church strongly emphasizes the healing of marital and otherfamily difficulties, its members are no less proneto divorce than are Protestants as a group. Eddy understood God to be beyond sexual characterization and referred to God as \"Father-Mother God.\" This understanding of God, alongwith the fact that Eddy was a female leader in atime of few female leaders, has provided a foun-dation for relatively egalitarian gender relation-ships within the Christian Science tradition. Christian Science teaches that homosexuality is a condition that should be addressed withcompassion and with efforts to heal rather thanwith either condemnation or uncritical accept-ance. Sexual activity is appropriate only withinthe bonds of marriage. Known homosexuals andadulterers are unlikely to be elected to officeswithin the church or accepted as practitionersuntil full healing has occurred. Eddy believed that as long as people under- stood themselves to be physical beings, theywould be sexual creatures who could sustainhumankind only through sexual reproduction.Once human thought was perfected, however,sexuality for its own sake would subside,humans would become immortal, and procre-ation as we know it would become unnecessary. CLINICAL ISSUES Treatment of children Adults in this country may legally choose toforgo medical treatment for themselves. Butwhen a guardian or proxy decides to forgo medical treatment on behalf of a minor orincompetent adult, many ethical and legalconsiderations arise. Because ChristianScientists have often rejected commonlyaccepted medical treatment for their children,they have been involved in an ongoing debateabout the rights and responsibilities of parentsin caring for their children. Defenders ofChristian Science maintain that parents have aright to exercise their religious convictions andshould not be punished for acting in what theyjudge to be the best interests of their children.They also point frequently to continuingevidence of physical healing through ChristianScience treatment of children and adults. Critics,however, argue that no child should be\"martyred\" or denied important medical treat-ment on the basis of the parents' religiousbeliefs. It seems that, due to heavy pressure andglaring publicity over the last few decades,Christian Science parents are now much morelikely to seek medical treatment for their chil-dren at the outset of a physical problem\u2014thoughthis is by no means universal. This debate certainly has implications for those who take temporary responsibility for thecare of Christian Scientists' children, includingteachers, day-care providers, relatives, andfriends. Ideally, such caregivers should reach aprior agreement with parents about how toproceed in cases of emergency. In the absence ofsuch an agreement, caregivers should exercisetheir own judgment regarding the provision ofemergency medical care to children. Aspokesperson for the Church of Christ, Scientist,advises that \"in cases of accident, ChristianScience parents would not object to the admin-istration of on-the-spot first aid for their chil-dren. But in some instances they might prefer,after careful consideration, to have ChristianScience treatment rather than hospitalization,surgery, or extended therapy. Again, however,prayer and reasoned judgment amid the exigen- 6 THECHRISTIAN SCIENCE TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSFAMILY , SEXUALITY , AND PROCREATIONcies of practical situations\u2014rather than abstract criteria\u2014tend to shape the choice of treatment inemergency cases.\" 11 The idea that parents would rely solely on prayer for the healing of their children seemsforeign to many medical professionals. ForChristian Science families, it seems very natural;teaching children to use prayer as a practical aidin all aspects of their lives is a common part offamily life. Such aid may include finding a lostpet, conquering fear, or overcoming sickness.Christian Science parents often find that chil-dren are very receptive to this approach tohandling problems and Scientists believe thatchildren, through their easy understanding ofGod, are able to heal others. Eddy taught that the thoughts and actions of parents can have profound effects, both positiveand negative, on the physical well-being of theirchildren. She wrote: Mind regulates the condition of the stomach, bowels, and food, the temperature of children andof men, and matter does not. The wise or unwiseviews of parents and other persons on thesesubjects produce good or bad effects on the healthof children . . . Giving drugs to infants, noticing every symptom of flatulency, and constantly directing the mind tosuch signs,\u2014that mind being laden with illusionsabout disease, health-laws, and death,\u2014theseactions convey mental images to children'sbudding thoughts, and often stamp them there,making it probable at any time that such ills maybe reproduced in the very ailments feared. A childmay have worms, if you say so, or any othermalady, timorously held in the beliefs concerninghis body. Thus are laid the foundations of thebelief in disease and death, and thus are childreneducated into discord. 12 To Christian Scientists, the mental influences of parents upon their children are of muchgreater consequence than physical threats ormedical treatments. Published accounts and personal experiences of healing in children under Christian Sciencecare demonstrate for Christian Scientists theeffectiveness of such treatment for children.Reports include healing of children withmedically diagnosed conditions such as chemicalburns, pleurisy, stomach tumor, bowed legs, andbone disease. Because of these and many otherexperiences of healing, Christian Scientistsbelieve that parents should have the legal rightto choose this form of treatment for their chil-dren rather than medical treatment. Others disagree. They cite cases in which children under Christian Science care have diedas a result of conditions for which early medicaltreatment is normally successful, such as menin-gitis and juvenile diabetes, as proof of theimportance of medical treatment. Because ofthis conviction, they believe that all parentshave a duty to seek medical care for their chil-dren under certain circumstances. Occasionally Christian Science parents in the United States have been criminally prosecuted forfailing to seek medical care that others thoughtcould have saved their child's life. In recent years,the number of such cases has dramaticallyincreased; during the period from 1983 to 1989,Christian Science parents were criminally prose-cuted in seven separate cases in various stateswith various outcomes. Most of the verdicts havebeen appealed to higher state courts, but nonehas been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In1993, the first civil trial of a Christian Scienceparent began; in that case, the Minnesota Courtof Appeals upheld the trial court's award of $1.5million in compensatory damages to the deceasedboy's father, which were to be paid by the boy'smother, his stepfather, and his Christian Sciencenurse and practitioner. The defendants filed apetition for writ of certiorari, a request for review,with the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Courtrefused to review it, thus making the MinnesotaState Court of Appeals' judgment final. Most states have \"religious exception\" or \"religious accommodation\" provisions in theirchild welfare statutes that protect parents from 7 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERbeing judged negligent solely on the ground that they do not provide medical treatment for achild because of their religious beliefs.Experience has shown, however, that the mereexistence of these provisions does not automati-cally protect parents from prosecution by deter-mined legal authorities. Current federalDepartment of Health and Human Servicesregulations require that all cases in which chil-dren are denied medical treatment be reportedto state welfare authorities, regardless of theparents' religious intent. 13States may or may not charge religiously motivated parents withmedical neglect, depending on state laws, theattitudes of state authorities, and the circum-stances of a particular case. Nevertheless, in allcases, states do have the authority to ensure thatnecessary medical services are provided to achild. Because this is such a controversial issue,the battles to define the rights and responsibili-ties of parents as they relate to the care of theirchildren are likely to continue. Contraception Most Christian Scientists would not use birthcontrol pills because they are drugs, althoughthis may not be their sole reason. Discretion isleft to those involved.Sterilization No official position was found on sterilization. New reproductive technologies No official position was found on artificial insem-ination, gamete intrauterine fallopian transfer(GIFT), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or surrogatemotherhood. Christian Scientists would generallyapproach fertility problems as they deal withother physical challenges\u2014through prayer. Abortion and the status of the fetus Abortion is rare among Christian Scientists, more because of its moral implications than because it is viewed as a medical procedure. Prenatal diagnosis and treatment Discretion is left to those involved. Care of severely handicapped newborns Discretion is left to those involved. 8 THECHRISTIAN SCIENCE TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSGENETICS Christian Scientists believe that to examine or alter human genes is to focus on the physical rather than the spiritual and to concedethat our physical substance, rather than ourrelationship with God, determines who we are. About hereditary disease Eddy wrote, \"TheScientist knows that there can be no hereditarydisease, since matter is not intelligent.\" 14 Most Christian Scientists reject organ andtissue transplants for the same reasons that they reject other medical treatment.ORGAN AND TISSUE TRANSPLANTATIONFor Christian Scientists, mental illness, like all other ailments, arises out of a false under- standing of the nature of reality and can behealed through right understanding. Speaking ofthe \"arguments,\" or prayerful affirmations ofspiritual truth, used in Christian Science treat-ment, Eddy wrote: The treatment of insanity is especially interesting. However obstinate the case, it yields more readilythan do most diseases to the salutary action of truth,which counteracts error. The arguments to be usedin curing insanity are the same as in other diseases:namely, the impossibility that matter, brain, cancontrol or derange mind, can suffer or causesuffering; also the fact that truth and love will estab-lish a healthy state, guide and govern mortal mindor the thought of the patient, and destroy all error,whether it is called dementia, hatred, or any otherdiscord. 15 CLINICAL ISSUES Involuntary commitment No official position was found on involuntary commitment.Psychotherapy and behavior modification Psychotherapy and behavior modification areconsidered undesirable treatment for ChristianScientists suffering from mental illnesses becausesuch illnesses can be treated with ChristianScience prayer, as can any other illness. Psychopharmacology \"The supposition that we can correct insanity bythe use of purgatives and narcotics is in itself amild species of insanity.\" 16 Electroshock and stimulation Electroshock and stimulation are consideredundesirable treatments for Christian Scientistssuffering from mental illnesses because suchillnesses can be treated with Christian Scienceprayer, as can any other illness. Christian Scientists believe that experimenta-tion on humans is not appropriate. 9 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERMENTAL HEALTH MEDICAL EXPERIMENTATION AND RESEARCHChristian Scientists regard death not as the end of being or of individual identity\u2014nor as a sudden plunge into a heaven or a hell. Insteaddeath is a transition to a new stage of existenceand growth. They believe that, for individuals,\"life in the hereafter involves growth in holiness,repentance and spiritual regeneration as doesthis life.\" 17On a higher level, they believe that once the last traces of sin and delusion disappearfrom the human mind, death itself will disappear. CLINICAL ISSUES Determining death \"If you or I should appear to die, we should notbe dead. The seeming decease, caused by amajority of human beliefs that man must die, orproduced by mental assassins, does not in theleast disprove Christian Science; rather does itevidence the truth of its basic proposition thatmortal thoughts in belief rule the materialitymiscalled life in the body or in matter. But theforever fact remains paramount that Life, Truth,and Love save from sin, disease, and death.\" 18 Pain control and palliative care \"If from an injury or from any cause, a ChristianScientist were seized with pain so violent that hecould not treat himself mentally,\u2014and theScientists had failed to relieve him,\u2014the sufferercould call a surgeon, who would give him ahypodermic injection, then, when the belief ofpain was lulled, he could handle his own casementally.\" 19 Christian Scientists in general and Christian Science nurses in particular are guided byEddy's teaching that \"it is no more Christianlyscientific to see disease than it is to experienceit. If you would destroy the sense of disease, youshould not build it up by wishing to see theforms it assumes or by employing a single mate-rial application for its relief.\" 20Thus, many commonly accepted forms of monitoringpatients and providing palliative care\u2014such as using a fever thermometer, taking a pulse,applying heat or ice, or giving a backrub\u2014areincompatible with relying on spiritual means forhealing; Christian Science holds that if one isconfidently relying on prayer for healing, he orshe will not choose to use physical ways andmeans. Forgoing life-sustaining treatment Christian Scientists generally forgo most kindsof medical treatment because they choose to relysolely on Christian Science treatment, both forthemselves and for their children. (See\"Treatment of children,\" above.) Suicide, assisted suicide, and euthanasia The Church of Christ, Scientist, has issued thefollowing statement with respect to euthanasia: Normally, questions about euthanasia are discussed within a medical context in which certain condi-tions or diseases are regarded as irreversible.Christian Scientists, on the other hand, do not consider any disease beyond the power of God toheal . . . Thus, they wouldn't ordinarily approacheven serious or 'terminal' problems from the perspective that resignation to death is the only option. 21 Autopsy and postmortem care In most cases, Christian Scientists would prefer that female bodies be handled by other femalesand that no autopsy be performed. 22Nonetheless, the governing by-laws in the Manual of The Mother Church state that \"if a member of The Mother Church shall decease suddenly, withoutprevious injury or illness, and the cause thereof beunknown, an autopsy shall be made by qualifiedexperts.\" 23 Last rites, burial, and mourning customs \"The Christian Science Church does notperform last rites, nor does it have ritual or 10 THECHRISTIAN SCIENCE TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSDEATH AND DYINGdoctrinal requirements regarding the bodily remains of the deceased. Arrangements forburial or cremation are left to the next of kin, asare decisions regarding services. Some familiesmay prefer not to have a service. Others mayhold services at home or in a funeral parlor. In many cases, a simple memorial service would beheld.\" 24Christian Scientists often prefer cremation over burial.25 ATTITUDES TOWARD DIET AND THE USE OF DRUGS Active members of the church avoid alcohol, tobacco, and the use of drugs on grounds that these are artificial and unnecessary materialstimulants. Eddy wrote, \"The depraved appetitefor alcoholic drinks, tobacco, tea, coffee, opium,is destroyed only by Mind's mastery of the body. . . Puffing the obnoxious fumes of tobacco, orchewing a leaf naturally attractive to no creatureexcept a loathsome worm, is at leastdisgusting.\" 26Narcotics may be appropriate under certain circumstances. (See \"Pain control andpalliative care,\" above.) Scientists avoid gamblingon traditional moral grounds, and usually do notmake use of medical therapies because of volun-tary reliance on spiritual means for healing. CLERGY , WORSHIP , AND POLITY The Church of Christ, Scientist, has no ordainedclergy. The Bible and Science and Health act as the \"pastor\" of the church, but Science and Health is not considered to be scripture. Worship consists of music, silent prayer, theLord's Prayer, and the reading by two membersof a lesson-sermon containing assigned textsfrom the Bible and Science and Health . Many members study the lesson-sermon each day during the preceding week. There is no personalpreaching or ceremony or administering ofsacraments in the church. Eddy taught thatcommunion occurs in one's heart and thatbaptism is a process of continued spiritualpurification. During Wednesday testimony meet-ings, the first reader reads selections from the Bible and Science and Health , and then members share experiences of healing. The governmental structure of the church is specified in Eddy's Manual of The Mother Church , which places governance of the church with a five-member board of directors at theFirst Church of Christ, Scientist, in Boston,Massachusetts\u2014commonly known as The MotherChurch. The Board, while entrusted with exten-sive practical authority in the day-to-dayconduct of church business, itself operatesunder the constraints of the church's Manual in an essentially constitutional form of churchgovernment. Board members serve for varyinglengths of time and appoint their own succes-sors. Most Scientists are members of both TheMother Church and a local branch church.Branch churches operate democratically withinfairly strict guidelines set out in the Manual . SPECIAL DAYS Services are held on Sunday mornings, and testimony meetings are held on Wednesdayevenings. MEMBERSHIP There has been a decrease in the number ofChristian Science practitioners worldwide fromapproximately 8,300 in 1960 to about 1,700 in2002. The number of Christian Science branchchurches and societies has declined from about3,000 in 1950 to about 1,400 in 2002. Taking 11 THEPARKRIDGE CENTERSPECIAL CONCERNS12 THECHRISTIAN SCIENCE TRADITION : RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND HEALTHCARE DECISIONSthese and other indicators into account, one can arrive at a rough estimate of possible MotherChurch membership. The Mother Church doesnot report membership statistics, since Eddyprohibited doing so at a time when memberswere becoming more prideful because ChristianScience was growing rapidly. But a U. S. Censusreport in 1936 listed Mother Church member-ship in the United States as about 269,000.Informed estimates would indicate that thenumber of Mother Church members today iswell below half that figure, though many whoare not formal members of the denominationcount themselves students of Christian Science. While it is true that women have dominated the church numerically, they have not domi-nated in the high offices of the church. Andalthough the demographic characteristics ofmembers are not precisely known, more of themembership is rural or of lower-middle-classbackgrounds than many people assert. 27 TENETS The religious tenets, or basic convictions, ofChristian Science are these: 1. As adherents of Truth, we take the inspired Word of the Bible as our sufficient guide to eternal Life. 2. We acknowledge and adore one supreme and infi- nite God. We acknowledge His Son, one Christ;the Holy Ghost or divine Comforter; and man inGod's image and likeness.3. We acknowledge God's forgiveness of sin in the destruction of sin and the spiritual understandingthat casts out evil as unreal. But the belief in sinis punished so long as the belief lasts. 4. We acknowledge Jesus' atonement as the evidence of divine, efficacious Love, unfolding man's unitywith God through Christ Jesus the Way-shower;and we acknowledge that man is saved throughChrist, through Truth, Life, and Love as demon-strated by the Galilean Prophet in healing the sickand overcoming sin and death. 5. We acknowledge that the crucifixion of Jesus and his resurrection served to uplift faith to under-stand eternal Life, even the allness of Soul, Spirit,and the nothingness of matter. 6.

Increasingly, health-care workers face the challenge of providingappropriate care and services to people of differentreligious backgrounds. Unfortunately, manyhealthcare workers are unfamiliar with the reli-gious beliefs and moral positions of traditionsother than their own. This booklet is one of aseries that aims to provide accessible and practicalinformation about the values and beliefs of differ-ent religious traditions. It should assist nurses,physicians, chaplains, social workers, and adminis-trators in their decision making and care giving. It can also serve as a reference for believers whodesire to learn more about their own traditions. Each booklet gives an introduction to the history of the tradition, including its perspectiveson health and illness. Each also covers the tradi-tion's positions on a variety of clinical issues,with attention to the points at which moraldilemmas often arise in the clinical setting. Finally, each booklet offers information on spe-cial concerns relevant to the particular tradition. The editors have tried to be succinct, objec- tive, and informative. Wherever possible, we haveincluded the tradition's positions as reflected inofficial statements by a governing or other formalbody, or by reference to positions formulated byauthorities within the tradition. Bear in mindthat within any religious tradition, there may bemore than one denomination or sect that holdsviews in opposition to mainstream positions, orgroups that maintain different emphases. The editors also recognize that the beliefs and values of individuals within a tradition may varyfrom the so-called official positions of their tradi-tion. In fact, some traditions leave moral decisionsabout clinical issues to individual conscience. Wewould therefore caution the reader against gener-alizing too readily.The guidelines in these booklets should not substitute for discussion of patients' own religious views on clinical issues. Rather, theyshould be used to supplement information coming directly from patients and families, andused as a primary source only when such first-hand information is not available. We hope that these booklets will help practitioners see that religious backgrounds and beliefs play a part in the way patients dealwith pain, illness, and the decisions that arise inthe course of treatment. Greater understanding of religious traditions on the part of careproviders, we believe, will increase the quality of care received by the patient.
