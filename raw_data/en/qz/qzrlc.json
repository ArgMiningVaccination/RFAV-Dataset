Long used in Ayurvedic medicine and TCM, they are suitable for the keto diet and plant-based diets.", "sitename": "South China Morning Post", "date": "2020-07-29", "cleaned_text": "superfoods used in Ayurveda and TCM, why they are good for you and how to eat them - three recipes - Lotus seeds help prevent cancer, boost immunity and relieve depression, stress and anxiety. They've long been used in Ayurvedic medicine and Chinese medicine - Water lily seeds, or fox nuts, are often misnamed lotus seeds. Eat them as a high-protein, low-fat popcorn alternative and as part of keto and plant-based diets Heard of Plant Pops? They are touted as a healthy alternative to popcorn, with less fat, more protein, and fewer calories. It's probably why they're a celebrity favourite, too, with actor and producer Priyanka Chopra Jonas, who prefers them as a snack, and Irish chef and food writer Darina Allen, who says they have an addictive crunchiness. While the packaging refers to them as lotus seeds, they are, in fact, seeds of the water lily, also known as fox nuts. Indian-born Anushi Desai turned her childhood snack food - the popular spiced and roasted fox nuts known as makhana - into a business for Plant Pops in the UK, and took home the best snacking innovation award from the World Food Innovation Awards in 2019. Desai says: \"When we started making our snacks, I always knew them as makhana - the term we used growing up. We spoke to numerous farmers and manufacturers, who referred to them as fox nuts or lotus seeds. The reason we've used the term lotus seeds is to stick to the tradition of what it's called in India, where our snacks come from.\" A host of other fox nut snack makers do the same, sparking some confusion. While fox nuts and lotus seeds differ, both are superfoods used in Ayurveda - traditional Indian medicine - and in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In TCM, both are consdered to be herbs that stabilise and bind, with a neutral nature and a sour-sweet taste. Both target the kidney and spleen, and the lotus seed also targets the heart. Fox nuts come from the floating water lily plant native to East and South Asia - whose scientific name is Euryale ferox - and are widely used in India, China and Japan. As the lily's seed is harvested in stagnant wetlands, no fertilisers or pesticides are needed, making them naturally organic. Known also as gorgon nuts, in TCM they are called qian shi, or cock's head. Apart from fox nuts' use as a snack, they are found in Indian desserts like kheer - a milk pudding - and also ground into flour, to be used in Indian flatbreads or rotis. An episode of the new Netflix series Indian Matchmaking even features a nitrogen-injected version of fox nuts.. Ruchi Shrivastava, food historian and owner of Mumbai-based food media company Greed Goddess, says the confusion of fox nuts, or makhana, with lotus seeds \"comes from the fact that we don't differentiate the water lily from the lotus in our native languages\". Used in the right way, makhana can offer many benefits, particularly in the fight against lifestyle diseases.

Shrivastava calls makhana \"poor man's are affordable and beneficial to health. \"They are low in sodium and high in potassium, so they reduce blood pressure and are good for diabetics, too. So, instead of adding almond or cashew paste in curries to make them rich, we always use a mix of fox nuts and poppy seeds. \"As a kid, when I was unwell, my mother used to give me roasted makhana with a dash of ghee and a pinch of salt and black pepper - it would help restore the taste in my palate,\" she says.

It has been cultivated in China for more than 3,000 years for its edible seeds. They are packed with fibre, calcium and host of other nutrients, and used in baking, in puddings and candies, or mixed into dishes such as the Chinese sticky rice dumpling known as bajang, and in desserts, like the custardy Thai dish khanom mo kaeng. In the book Ten Lectures on the Use of Medicinals from the Personal Experience of Jiao Shu-de, a TCM practitioner describes lotus seeds, or lian zhi, as \"sweet and astringent in flavour and neutral in nature\" and says they nourish the heart, fortify the spleen, supplement the kidney, and work as an astringent. In TCM, an astringent is a substance that is seen as able to prevent the leakage of needed fluids and prevent the loss of vital energy. Astringents also work as a diuretic, to promote secretion of unwanted or excess fluids. China's Ministry of Health approved lotus seeds' use as both food and medicine. A 2016 study by Zhu et al, published in Frontiers in Plant Science, highlights the benefits to be derived from lotus seeds. Previous studies have shown that lotus seeds are rich in flavonoids and alkaloids. Flavonoids are lauded for their potential in preventing chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and various types of cancers. Lotus seed alkaloids have been found to have properties that relieve depression, help manage irregular heartbeat and relieve excess fluid in the lungs.
