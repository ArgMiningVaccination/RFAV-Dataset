Vaccination is the best way to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection. To the best of our knowledge, more than eight COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for vaccination among priority groups under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), including the Moderna variant 20H/501Y.V2 (lineage B.1.351) appeared in South Africa. [8](#B8-jkms-36-e124)On January 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 variant 20J/501Y.V3 (lineage P.1, a branch of the B.1.1.28 lineage) appeared in Brazil, which again attracted attention. The UK SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant is defined by multiple spike (S) protein in South Africa has eight mutations involving S protein (L18F, D80A, (B.1.351 lineage) does not contain the deletion at 69-70. The SARS-CoV-2 P.1 variant in Brazil harbors three S protein mutations E484K, K417N and N501Y in common with 20J/501Y.V2 (lineage B.1.351). Why Is the S Protein the Target of Most COVID-19 Vaccine Designs? [Fig. 1](#F1-jkms-36-e124)). The S1 subunit mainly contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which is responsible for recognizing receptors. Mutations involving RBD-associated amino acids lead to changes in the preference and infection characteristics of viral species. The S2 subunit comprises elements that are essential for membrane fusion. The S protein plays a vital role in the binding of the virus to, and its fusion with, the host cell membrane receptor. [10](#B10-jkms-36-e124)Given its crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 infection and adaptive immunity, the S protein is an important target site for neutralizing antibodies and a key target for vaccine design. [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines)), there are 64 COVID-19 candidate vaccines in clinical trials ( [Supplementary Table 1](#S1-jkms-36-e124)) and 171 COVID-19 candidate vaccines in pre-clinical trials ( [Supplementary Table 2](#S2-jkms-36-e124)). Among the 64 COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials, 44 are based on the S protein, of which 29 are based on the full-length S protein (65.91%, 29/44), 14 on the S protein RBD (31.82%, 14/44), Pfizer-BioNtech BNT162b2 vaccines were designed based on the nucleotide sequence of the S protein. Table 1 What Are the Key Mutations of the S Protein? [Fig. 2A](#F2-jkms-36-e124)). By analyzing the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from nextstrain.org ( [https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global)), we found that the viral mutations were more likely to occur in spring, autumn, and winter, and less likely in summer (as shown by white lines in [Fig. 2A](#F2-jkms-36-e124)). This may be related to the slow spread of the virus in summer due to higher temperatures, as demonstrated by a temporal multivariate time series model in a recent study. [11](#B11-jkms-36-e124)In addition, we found that the number of mutants in the 20I/501Y.V1, 20H/501Y.V2, and 20J/501Y.V3 [https://nextstrain.org/sars-cov-2/](https://nextstrain.org/sars-cov-2/)) and GISAID Mutation Tracker It was found that as many as 26,844 single mutations were tracked in 203,346 human coronavirus 2019 (hCoV-19) genomes, and the most frequent mutations were observed to involve the NSP3 and S proteins ( [Fig. 1](#F1-jkms-36-e124)). Considering the importance of the S protein, we further focused on S protein mutations. By December 26, 2020, at least 5,003 mutations were identified in the S protein by Mutation Tracker ( [Supplementary Table 3](#S3-jkms-36-e124)). There were 13 nonsynonymous mutations with a total frequency of > 1,000, and three mutations that are of interest, and P272L) occurred in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein, and five (N439K, Y453F, S477N, E484K, and N501Y) appeared in the S protein RBD. Do These Mutations Affect COVID-19 Vaccines Targeting the S Protein? [12](#B12-jkms-36-e124)The emergence of these variant strains is remarkable because the N501Y mutation shared by the three strains is located in the key RBD of the S protein. [13](#B13-jkms-36-e124)This mutation may enhance the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to bind to human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), thus accelerating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. [7](#B7-jkms-36-e124) [14](#B14-jkms-36-e124)A preprint study published in medRxiv showed that serum of convalescent COVID-19 patients and vaccinators could neutralize the N501Y variant, suggesting that current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will protect against the 20B/501Y.V1 strain. [15](#B15-jkms-36-e124) [16](#B16-jkms-36-e124)A previous study reported that the D614G mutation increases susceptibility of the virus to neutralization, and the D614G mutation is not expected to threaten current vaccine development. [17](#B17-jkms-36-e124)However, in another study, the D614G mutation did not alter the binding of the spike protein to ACE2 or the neutralization sensitivity of pseudoviruses. The authors suggested that the D614G mutation might increase infectivity by assembling more functional S protein into virions. [18](#B18-jkms-36-e124)S477N, a mutation involving the RBD, has emerged independently in Australia and is responsible for much of the summer 2020 outbreak. Previous studies have indicated that this mutation may slightly increase the ACE2 binding affinity [19](#B19-jkms-36-e124)of the virus and confer resistance to multiple antibodies. [20](#B20-jkms-36-e124)The E484K mutation is associated with the 501Y.V2 variant in South Africa and the 501Y.V3 variant identified in Manaus, Amazonas, and Brazil. [8](#B8-jkms-36-e124) the neutralizing potency of convalescent sera from some donors by 10-fold. In one study, following the co-incubation of SARS-CoV-2 with convalescent plasma, the virus was reported to completely escape neutralization by day 73 due to the emergence of the E484 mutation. [22](#B22-jkms-36-e124) [23](#B23-jkms-36-e124)Another study evaluated antibody and memory B cell responses in a cohort of 20 volunteers vaccinated with the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines. The results showed that the neutralization activity induced by both vaccines decreased slightly, but nevertheless, significantly, against SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding E484K or N501Y, or the K417N-E484K-N501Y January 26, 2021, a preprint study in bioRxiv reported that Covaxin, the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech, effectively neutralized the UK variant of SARS-CoV-2, reducing the possibility of immune escape by the mutant virus. [25](#B25-jkms-36-e124)Similarly, the neutralizing activity of antibodies induced by the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was 9-fold lower against the B.1.1.7 variant than against the canonical non-B. 1.1.7 lineage, but its efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant (74.6%) was similar to that of the vaccine against other lineages (84%). [26](#B26-jkms-36-e124)Recently, a preclinical study demonstrated that the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine increased the levels of neutralizing antibodies and provided protection against the SARS-CoV-2 G614 spike variant by performing immune challenge experiments in a Syrian hamster model. [27](#B27-jkms-36-e124) [28](#B28-jkms-36-e124)Furthermore, a phase IIb clinical trial of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine in South Africa showed that the vaccine is 60% effective in preventing the replication of the original strain of COVID-19. However, its effectiveness in preventing the South African variant strain was only 49.4%. [28](#B28-jkms-36-e124)This is the first vaccine to demonstrate clinical efficacy against 'normal' COVID-19 and both the UK and South African variants. What Measures Should Be Taken to Deal with Viral Mutations? (1) The monoclonal antibodies employed in the clinic should be tested again against the new variants. As a COVID-19 therapeutic agent, S protein-specific neutralizing antibodies can interact with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to inhibit the virus from invading the human body. Monoclonal antibodies have been authorized for emergency use. It has been reported that viral mutants may reduce the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies. [29](#B29-jkms-36-e124)Therefore, it is urgent to confirm the efficacy of these monoclonal and serum antibodies in neutralizing mutant viruses. (2) Vaccines under EUA may need to be updated periodically with respect to clinical efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Currently, 44 vaccines that have entered the clinical trial stage were developed based on the S protein, and the data indicate that the S protein is the most mutated part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Increasing evidence also shows that some COVID-19 vaccines are less effective in protecting against variants. [24](#B24-jkms-36-e124) [28](#B28-jkms-36-e124)These data suggest that vaccine manufacturers must update their vaccines in time to deal with viral mutations. Otherwise, the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine may be affected. (3) The effectiveness of vaccines under EUA should be evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Phase III clinical trials of the six vaccines currently approved for emergency use were completed before the end of 2020. The actual efficacy data were also obtained based on infection by the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. This means that the efficacy of these vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants remains unknown. Thus far, only the efficacy of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine against variants has been studied in a phase III clinical trial, and the results indicate that the efficacies of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine against the original COVID-19, the UK variant, and the South African variant strains were 95.6%, 85.6%, and 49.4%, respectively. [28](#B28-jkms-36-e124) (4) For vaccines still in pre-clinical studies, SARS-CoV-2 variant-infected animal models should be established to assess their efficacy. Transgenic mice with humanized lungs and immune systems represent ideal animal models for COVID-19 vaccine and drug development. [30](#B30-jkms-36-e124)In August 2020, Hansen et al. [31](#B31-jkms-36-e124)created a humanized mouse model and compared the similarities and consistencies of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein produced by humanized mice and convalescent patients. In the future, the development of a transgenic or humanized animal model for SARS-CoV-2 variant infection will greatly promote the development of more effective COVID-19 vaccines. (5) Implement more stringent public health control strategies, such as wearing masks and social distancing. The scientific formulation and rapid and effective implementation of public health control strategies by governments are decisive factors for decreasing viral transmission, especially in countries where vaccines have not yet been made available. If people strictly abide by these public health control strategies, SARS-CoV-2 transmission would decrease, thereby lowering the frequency of mutations. In the face of the rapidly mutating virus, formulating and following public health control strategies is one of the most effective and economical strategies to deal with such crises. (6) Efforts should be made to curb the spread of variant SARS-CoV-2 strains through international cooperation and by strengthening immigration quarantine. Experience and studies indicate that the rapid spread of COVID-19 is closely related to intensive personnel exchanges and cross-border travel. [32](#B32-jkms-36-e124)What is even more worrying is that variant SARS-CoV-2 viruses tend to have stronger transmission capabilities, which makes the spread of such variants more difficult to control internationally. To circumvent this challenge, effective international cooperation strategies should be formulated and implemented, and at the same time, countries should strengthen their immigration quarantine policies to reduce the risk of the cross-border transmission "}
