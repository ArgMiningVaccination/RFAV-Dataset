In today's connected and fast-paced world, keeping pace with the rigorous demands of work and social life can lead to mental exhaustion. Technology overload, excess amounts of stress, and the natural process of aging can impair memory and focus, leading to brain fog. Brain Reboot IV infusion therapy delivers a potent mix of nutrients including B12, B6, B-complex, glutathione, folic acid, taurine, alpha lipoic acid, and niacinamide that reduce mental fatigue while boosting clarity and focus. Recent studies have shown that close to 40 percent of the US population is vitamin B12-deficient. Low B12 levels cause memory loss, fatigue, and other nervous system-related problems. Brain Reboot IV infusion delivers the right amount of B12 to boost cognition and memory. Vitamin B6, also called as pyridoxine, regulates mental function, boost memory while stabilizing mood by stepping up the production of the \"happy hormone,\" serotonin, and by increasing the blood circulation in nerve cells. Glutathione is one of the most powerful antioxidants that fight oxidative stress, which is linked to many brain disorders including poor memory, cognition, and concentration. Scientists have found that high doses of folic acid can slow down memory impairment that accompanies aging while boosting mood. Clinical studies show that taurine, an amino acid, has neuroprotective effects, and boosts both memory and learning ability. Alpha-lipoic acid has antioxidant properties and is effective in correcting memory deficit and cognitive decline. Some studies show that niacinamide is effective in reducing memory loss in Alzheimer's while boosting focus and mental clarity in healthy adults. Brain Reboot IV therapy should ideally be taken every week for four weeks followed by monthly infusions thereon. A la carte enhancement with phosphatidylcholine is available. Toxins are all around us. Sometimes, our lifestyles willingly invite toxins into our body, which over time, can potentially cause chronic diseases. Cleanse & Detox IV drip cleanses your body off toxins and helps your vital organs function optimally. The IV infusion comprises Vit C, B pack, trace minerals, glycine/glutamine/taurine, each providing benefits for your physical and mental wellness. Vitamin C is an essential antioxidant that your liver needs to process and eliminate toxins. A low level of Vitamin C not only disturbs your body's detoxification process, it also causes fatigue, depletes your energy levels and affects your mood. A non-essential amino acid, glutamine supports your brain during times of stress, lowering anxiety and lifting your mood. As an antioxidant amino acid, taurine helps your body combat free radicals, protects brain cells, and avoids tissue damage. Glycine is another important amino acid that helps facilitate neurotransmissions in the brain, benefitting cognitive function. Trace minerals are so called because your body does not require them in large quantities. Still, their deficiency can disrupt the energy creation process and prevent the proper facilitation of nerve impulses, affecting the brain, muscle and all vital body organs. The role of B Vitamins in maintaining energy levels, maintaining good digestive health, supporting healthy heart and brain function, and counteracting damage from free radicals is well documented. Cleanse & Detox IV drip is recommended three times a week for two weeks. Glutathione is offered as an a la carte addition.

When you are looking to build the perfect physique of your dreams, you need to focus on losing fat, building muscle, improving health, and boosting endurance. Peak Performance IV infusion contains an ideal blend of amino acids, vitamins, and minerals that pack a powerful punch. Carnitine boosts athletic performance and endurance by transporting fat to muscle cells where they are used to produce energy during intense exercise. Studies show it can also improve the action of insulin on muscle cells, aiding in muscle building and facilitates post-workout muscle recovery. The demand for glutamine goes up during intense exercise or stress, injury, and illnesses. The amino acid prevents muscle loss that is caused by hormonal imbalance. Arginine is another amino acid that promotes muscle growth apart from burning fat stores. It also boosts endurance by releasing nitric oxide that promotes blood circulation. Intense workouts can increase the levels of cortisol, a hormone which can induce muscle breakdown. Vitamin C is a natural antioxidant that lowers cortisol levels post workout, preserving muscle mass and aiding in recovery. The vitamin also promotes wound healing and collagen synthesis. Clinical studies show that magnesium boosts athletic performance and endurance. Magnesium and B vitamins play key roles in energy production, muscular contraction, neurological activity, cardiac health, and bone metabolism. Vitamin B12 ensures the muscle cells get oxygen-rich blood during intense workouts, thereby boosting endurance. For best results, Peak Performance IV therapy should be taken after each strenuous exercise session. Phosphatidylcholine-based a la carte enhancements are available. Water makes up 60% of the human body. Losing just 1.5% of the body's reserves of water causes an imbalance of electrolytes with symptoms such as dry and flaky skin, headaches, light-headedness, confusion, and low blood pressure.

Favored by very famous athletes, it has also been credited as the reason some have been able to make a successful comeback to sports. What is PRP? Our blood constitutes a liquid (plasma) and small solid components - red and white cells and platelets. The latter consists of hundreds of proteins, which are referred to as growth factors, and they are vital in helping injuries heal faster, naturally. In PRP treatment, the technique employed segregates the platelets to deliver plasma that is approximately 5 to 10 times richer in growth factors than our normal blood is, which in turn accelerates the healing process tenfold.
