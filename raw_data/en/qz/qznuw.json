Length of cleanse: 2 Days Ingredients: Distilled Water, Grapefruit Juice, Orange Juice, Lemons What Is It? The 2 Day Detox is a special formulation of fresh grapefruit juice, orange juice, lemons and distilled water. It's based on the time-tested European method of periodic fasting. The main purpose of the cleanse is to help you cleanse, detoxify and rejuvenate your body. You flood your body with vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes and other phytonutrients to lose weight, detoxify your body, improve your immune system and boost your energy. What's In It? - Grapefruit Juice: This citrus fruit helps remove impurities from the blood, aids digestion, and promotes diuresis. A wonderful fat metabolizer, grapefruit contains limonene, pimene and citrol, which are all phytochemicals that can fight cancer. - Orange Juice: One of the highest sources of Vitamin C, oranges can protect us against colds and help the body fight cancers of the lung, cervix, esophagus and stomach. Oranges also contain bioflavonoids -- limonene in particular. - Lemons: Lemon juice is high in vitamins C, P, A and Folic Acid. Rich in bioflavonoids, lemon is a natural diuretic with antiseptic, germicidal, and mucous-eliminating properties. How Does It Work? Drink 8 bottles each day. (This product is available in gallon jugs in retail stores) Drink as much distilled or reverse osmosis water as desired - but no food. After the two days, slowly re-introduce unprocessed food into your diet in the form of fruits and vegetables.
