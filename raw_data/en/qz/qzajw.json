Novartis Confidential Page 15 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J Protocol summary Protocol number CLJC242A2201J Full Title A randomized, double -blind, multicenter study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a combination treatment of tropifexor (LJN452) and cenicriviroc (CVC) in adult patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NA SH) and liver fibrosis (TANDEM ) Brief title Study of safety , tolerability, and efficacy of a combination treatment of tropifexor and cenicriviroc in adult patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis Sponsor and Clinical PhaseNovartis Phase 2 b Investigation type Drug Study type Interventional Purpose and rationale The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy of two regimens of tropifexor and cenicriviroc compared to monotherapies tropifexor and CVC in patients with NASH and liver fibrosis. Primary Objective(s) The primary objective of this study is t o evaluate the safety and tolerability of tropifexor + CVC in patients with NASH withfibrosis stage F2/F3by monitoring adverse events, vital signs and laborator y values during 48 weeks of treatment as compared to monotherapy with each of tropifexor and CVC Secondary Objectives To characterize the efficacy of different doses of the combination drug tropifexor +CVC in patients with NASH withfibrosis stage F2/F3 as assess ed by histological improvement after 48 weeks of treatm ent compared to monotherapies (tropifexor and CVC) compared to baseline biopsy . Study design This study is arandomized, double- blind, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of tropifexor +CVC as compared to monotherapy with each of tropifexor and CVC . Population Adult male and female patients with histologic evidence o f NASH with stage 2 or 3 fibrosis based on centrally -read liver biopsy . The study will include a total of approximately 200patients. Key Inclusion criteria Written informed consent must be obtained before any assessment is performed. Male and female patients 18 years or older (at the time of the screening visit). Patients must weigh at least 50 kg (110 lb) and no more than 200 kg (440 lb) to participate in the study. Adequate liver biopsy sample for evaluation by a central reader. Presence of NASH as demonstrated by histologic evidence based on liver biopsy - NASH with fibrosis stage F2/F3 , demonstrated on liver biopsy during the screening period. Alternatively, a historical biopsy can be used if performed within 6 months prior to s creening, if: the patient has been receiving any of the therapies listed in Table 5-4, the dose must have been stable (since 1 month before the biopsy up to and including screening) , the patient's weight has been stable (maximum weight loss of 10% since bi opsy up to and including screening). Novartis Confidential Page 17 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J There is a single secondary objective in this study which is to characterize the efficacy of tropifexor + CVC as assessed by histological improvement after 48 weeks of treatment compared to monotherapies (tropifexor and CVC) relative to baseline biops y.There are two estimands that will be used to evaluate this objective. The first estimand is the difference on the proportion of patients on the different tropifexor + CVC regimens who achieve at least a one point improvement in fibrosis a t We ek 48 com pared to tropifexor and CVC monotherapy patients. The second estimand is the difference in the proportion of patients on the different tropifexor + CVC regimens who achieve resolution of steatohepatitis at W eek 48 relative to baseline compared to tropifexor and CVC monotherapy patients . Differences between tropifexor combination therapy and monotherapy with tropifexor or CVC with respect to these proportions (response rates) will be evaluated using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test controlli ng for baseline fibrosis stage (F2/F3). The estimand will be evaluated in the FAS population .

NAFLD is often a \"silent\" liver disease and usually associated with obesity , Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), dyslipidemia, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. Although most patients with NAFLD have a benign course, a subset of these patients may have the more severe and progressive form of NAFL D called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is characterized by the presence of ballooning degeneration and lobular inflammation with or without perisinusoidal fibrosis in addition to steatosis. Figure 1-1 Schematic progression of NAFLD/ NASH The disease spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. (A) Schematic of progression of NAFLD. The accumulation of Trigly cerides (TG)within lipid droplets in hepatocytes causes steatosis. Steatosis associated with inflammation, cell death, and fibrosis is referred to as NASH, which can progress to Novartis Confidential Page 19 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J cirrhosis. Individuals with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). (B) Histological sections illustrating normal liver, steatosis, NASH, and cirrhosis. Collagen fibers are stained blue with Masson's trichrome stain. The portal triad (PT), which consists of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and bile duct, and the cen tral vein (CV) are shown (Figure from Cohen JC 2011 ). The projected estimate of NASH with advanced fibrosis is approximately 4.1 million adults in the US. (Kabban y MN 2017) .Estimates vary due to the diagnostic modality used, study heterogeneity , but also the region of the world studied. Among NAFLD patients, NASH estimates are 29% -59% in North America. I n the overall global population, NASH prevalence is 3.8% (3-6.45%) (Foster et al 2012, Younossi et al 2016) .Patients with NASH can progress to cirrhosis, liver decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), need for a liver transplantation, and are at increased risk of death from liver disease. The incidence of advanced liver disease, liver failure and HCC related to NAFLD/NASH are increasing dramatically and NASH is projected to become the most common indication for liver transplantation (Beste LA 2015, Wong 2015, Neuschwander and Tetri B 2003 ) . NASH is the cause of progressive fibrosis in the patients with NAFLD. Fibrosis is the most important histological feature associated with all-cause mortality (e.g. cardiovascular disease) and liver complications in NASH (Angulo 2015, Ekstedt 2006) . Despite recent improvements in soluble biomarkers, liver biopsy is still the gold standard for diagnosing NASH and assessing the stage of fibrosi s in patients with NAFL D. Of note, rapid progressors may proceed to develop cirrhosis in only a 10-year perio d (Singh S 2015). Reducing liver fibrosis is expected to improve the long-term clinical outcomes of patients with NASH (Ratziu V 2015 ). There are no globall y approved treatments for NASH. Several studies have been conducted with Vitamin E and thiazolidinediones, but no long-term benefits have been demonstrated. There are potential new therapies being evaluated, currently in phase II or III trials, but the reported efficacy from the available studies are still lacking substantial benefit . The significant global burden of NASH, the currentl y available study results especiall y when considered with multifactorial etiology of NAFLD/NASH suggests that combinat ion therapy of different mechanisms of actions will bea more effective therap y for NASH patients. Farnesoid X receptor: tropifexor The bile acid receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), is a nuclear receptor expressed in liver, intestine, and kidney . FXR acts as a sensor of elevated bile acids and initiates homeostatic responses to control bile acid levels and modulate other metabolic processes such as gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis (Figure 1-1) (Pattni et al 2012 , Walters et 2015 ). In the liver, FXR agonism modulates bile acid synthesis and detoxify ing metabolism. FXR agonist increases expression of genes involved in canalicular and basolateral bile acid efflux and bile acid detoxify enzymes basolateral bile acid uptake by hepatocy tes FXR represses bile acid synthesis in the liver through induction of Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP), which is a negativ e regulator of CYP7A1, the rate-limiting enzy me of the neutral bile acid biosy nthetic pathway (Goodwin et al 2000). Furthermore, FXR agonists increase excretion of bile acids through the kidney, increase bile acid binding protei ns in the ileum and stimulate FGF15 (in rodents) or FGF19 (in humans) expression (a key regulator of bile acid metabolism). Novartis Confidential Page 23 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J Part 1 of the CLJN452 X2201 study in PBC patients is ongoing. No safety concerns were identified with doses ranging from 30 to 90 \u00b5g orally once dail y for 4 weeks. In summary , in clinical studies tropifexor has been well tolerated to date, with doses currentl y being tested up to 200 g orally in the ongoing phase 2 NASH program . C -C chemokine receptor type 2 and type 5 inhibitor: c enicriviroc Cenicriviroc mesylate (CVC) is an oral, dual antagonist of C-C motif chemokine receptor types 2 and 5 currently in clinical development for the treatment of liver fibrosis in adult patients with NASH. The Investigator 's Brochure (CVC IB) provides a detailed review of the pre-clinical and clinical information on CVC available to date. Human pharmacokinetic and pharmacod ynamic as well as safet y and tolerability data are further described in the CVC I B. Briefl y, CVC has demonstrated antifibrotic activity in animal models of liver and renal fibrosis ( Lefebvre et al 2016). Preclinical (Lefebvre et al 2016, Puengel et al 2016 ,Tacke et al 2015 ,Mossanen et al 2016 )and clinical evidence (Friedman et al 2017, Lefebvre et al 2016, Thompson et al 2016) support its anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties, which are mediated by C-C motif chemokine receptor types 2 and 5 blockade. The mechanism of action of CVC, as an anti -inflammatory and anti -fibrotic agent, supports its use in liver diseases, such as liver fibrosis associated with NASH. CVC treatment decreases the recruitment and migration of CCR2 -expressing monocytes to the site of liver injury, mainl y via CCR2 antagonism, thereby reducing the infiltration of pro -inflammatory , monocy te-derived macrophages into the In addition, CCR5 antagonism by CVC is expected to impair the migration, activation, and prolifer ation of collagen -producing activated hepatic stellate cells therefore reducing . Assessment of cenicriviroc in non- clinical s tudies In vitro data with CVC have demonstrated that it blocks the binding of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL 2; also known te chemotactic protein 1 [MCP -1]) to CCR2, and also blocks the binding of CCR5 ligands, CCL 3 (also known as macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-1, CCL 4 (also known as MIP-1 and CCL 5 (also known as regulated on activa tion normal T -cell expressed and secreted [RANTES]), to Ex vivo experiments showed that nanomolar concentrations of CVC achieved 98% receptor occupancy of CCR2 on human monocy tes and ~90% receptor occupancy for on human CD4+ and CD8+ Additionally , CVC an te and human lymphocy te (primaril y T-cells) migration in vitro. CVC's anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects have been evaluated in a range of nonclinical models of inflammation and fibrosis, and has demonstrated activity in multiple animal fibrosis models. The effects of CVC on the central nervous, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems were examined in a core battery of safety pharmacology studies. CVC at oral doses up to 1600 mg/kg had no effects on the general physical condition or behavior of rats. CVC had no significant effects on blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, or electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters (including PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and corrected QT interv al) at Novartis Confidential Page 24 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J oral doses up to 2000 mg/kg in cynomolgus and no effects on the respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute volume, or enhanced pause (Penh) up to 24 hours post- dose. Toxicology studies showed no target organ toxicity , thus no adverse liver findings, in mice or monkey s. In rats, the liver was the primary target organ identified in repeat dose studies, with biliary hyperplasia being the primary finding. Overall, the risk for hepatobiliary effects due to CVC appears to be low. The nonclinical data suggest that CVC will not adversel y affect the liver at or near clinical exposures. L iver findings were present in only 1 of 3 species and when present, a high safet y margin was apparent (>27 -fold). CVC was not genotoxic, and did not adversel y affect fertility or embry ofetal development ( refer to CVC IB for further details). Assessment ofcenicriviroc inclinical studies Overall, asofJanuar y 2 018, approximately 1154participants have beenexposed toCVC in completed andongoing clinical studies (January 2018 Development Safet y Update Report cutoff). CVC doses ranged from 25 m g to900 mgacross allCVC studies. There was no apparen t dos e-or exposur e-relationship for safe ty. Overall, CVC was generally well tolerated in the Phase 1 studies evaluating single doses of CVC up to 900 mg and at multiple daily doses of up to 900 mg for 7 days. In participants with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, CVC 150 mg QD for 14 days was general ly well tolerated regardless of level of hepatic impairment, and no safety concerns were identified in this population. In the Phase 1 studies, most adverse events (AEs) were mild or moderate in severi ty. The most commonly observed AEs ( 2%) with CVC in singl e-dose studies were headache, nasophar yngitis, all abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, contact dermatitis, andsomnolence. The most commonly observed AEs ( 2%) with CVC in multiple- dose studies were headache, and constipation. In the CENTAUR Phase 2b studyin adult participants with NASH wit h liver fibrosis, CVC appears to be safe with no notable differences observed compared to previous clinical studies in incidence of treatment -emergent AEs and laboratory abnormalities, including liver transaminase elevations, which were general lysimilar between treatment group s. Safety findings in CENTAUR were consistent with that of the extensive clinical experience with CVC, including the Phase 2 HIV studies. Study 652-2-203 (CENTAUR) isa 2-yearplacebo -controlled Phase 2bstudy in289 adult participants with liver fibrosis and NASH. Enrollment completed in June 2015 andYear 2 database lock was performed on 22 August 2017. In CENATUR ,theYear 1primar achieved inasimilar proportion of subjects onCVC (N = 145)andplaceb o (N = 144)(16% vs stage noworsening ofsteatohepatitis) was met intwice as many subjects onCVC than placebo in theITTpopulatio n (20 % vs 10%; p = 0.02) . At Year 1, a higher proportion of participants intheCVC group(29%) compared with thecombined placebo group(19%) had an improvement of at least 1 stage at Year 1 per the NASH CRN stagin g system .Similarl y,a higher proportion ofparticipants in the CVC group (35%) compared with the combined Novartis Confidential Page 25 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J placebo 1stage atYear pertheIshak inthose with highe rdisease activi ty and fibrosis stage at baseline. Biomarke rs of systemic inflammation were reduced with CVC .In summar y,CVC showed aclinically meaningful antifibrotic benefit and NASH patients with liver fibrosis. Todetermine thedurability ofhistological improvement achieved after 1 year of treatment, improvement in fibrosis by 1stage wasassessed insubjects with available biopsy results at all3 timepoints (baseline, Year 1, andYear 2). Results from this analysisshowed that the proportion of subjects in the CVC group who achieved improvement in fibrosis by 1 stage attheendof Year 1 intheCVC group versus 60% in the placebo group. Furthermore, in the subgroup of subjects with f ibrosis Stage 2or 3atbaseline, a highe r proportion of subjects receiving CVC achieved a 2-stage improvement infibrosis (and noworsening o Year tosubjects ving placebo (9.3% in the CVC group versus 2.7% in the placebo group, from baseli ne to Year2).When only subjects with Stage 3fibrosis atbaseline were included intheanalysis, 14.0% of subjects receiving CVC versus 4.2% of subjects receiving placebo for2 ye ars achieved a 2-stage improvement infibrosis (and noworsening of steatohepatitis) at Year 2. CVC had a generall ycomparable safety and tolerability profile to placebo over 2 years. Overall, the results from the final Year 2 analy sis confirmed the clinically meaningful antifibrotic effect of CVC treatment observed in the Year 1 primary anal ysis (Ratziu et al 2018 ). Given that severi ty offibrosis stage has been shown tobetheonly histological feature independent ly associated with clinical outcomes over thelong term, these results provide additiona levidenc e y profile ofCVC(150 mg QD) wascomparable to thatin participants treated with placebo andwaswell tolerated over 2 years.Thetypes, severity, and frequency ofTEAEs reported after 2years ofCVC treatment wasconsistent with those reported after 1 year of treatment. Theoverall incidence ofTEAEs during thestudy was similar across the treatment groups ( 95.0% of participants in each group). No deaths occurred during the study.Thefrequency and ty pesofTEAEs reported were comparable between treatment groups during Year 1 and Year 2. The frequency of treatment -related events reported after 2 years of CVC treatment was comparable to that reported after 1 year of treatment (41.7% vs 42.1%). The most frequent ly reported dru g-related TEAEs of at least Grade 2 severity through 1 year of treatment were fatigue (2.8%) and diarrhea (2.1%) in the CVC arm and headache (3.5%) in the placebo arms. The most frequent ly reported study drug-related TEAEs of at least Grade 2 severi ty through 2 years of treatment were fatigue (5.0%) in the CVC/CVC group, headache Novartis Confidential Page 26 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J in the placebo/CVC group (6.6%), and ALT increased (3.3%) in the placebo/placebo group. For participants who crossed- over from placebo and received CVC for 1 year, the frequen cy of TEAEs reported (44.3%) was similar to that reported in participants who received 1year CVC during Treatment Period 1 of the study (41.7%). A smaller number of participants experienced TEAEs that resulted in discontinuation of study drug. After 2 years of CVC treatment, the number of participants who discontinued the study due to a TEAE was greater than that reported for participants treated with 2 years of placebo (4.1% vs 0), but was comparable to that reported after 1 year of treatment (6.3%). Theonly AE leading to discontinuation, regardless of causali ty, reported in at least 2 participants in the CVC/CVC group was ALT increased (3 participants, 2.5%); all were Grade 3 severit y . Although the number of participants who experienced serious adverse events (SAEs) increased after 2 years of CVC treatment compared to placebo (18.2% vs 11.8%), almost all were considered not-related to study drug and did not lead to study discontinuation. Only 1 participant experienced a study drug-related event (Grade 3 heartarrh y thmia ),and only 1 event led to discontinuation (Grade 3 congestive heart failure considered not related to studymedication). With the exception of treatment -emergent Grade 3 and 4 amyl ase elevations and Grade 4 lipase elevations observed more frequentl yin the CVC arms versus the placebo arm (3.3% 1.7%, 2.2% versus 0.0%, and 21.1% versus 16.7%, respectivel y), the incidence of treatment -emergent Grade 3 or 4 laboratory results were generall ysimilar between the CVC arms and the placebo arm No meaningful changes in vital signs or anthropometric parameters were observed. Overall, the proportion of participants with confirmed liver transaminase elevations that met protocol -defined biochemical criteria for suspected drug-induced liver injury was 9.7% in the CVC group and 7.6% in the placebo group during the first year of treatment. The frequency did not increase in CVC-treated participants in Arm A after an additional year of treatment with CVC. No cases of H y's law were ob served in the s tudy. Among the participants who met the criterion for suspected drug induced liver injury , 2 hepatobiliary adverse events of autoimmune hepatitis were reported during Year 1 (1 participant in the CVC Arm A and 1 participant in the placebo Arm C). These participants did not continue onto treatment during Year 2. In addition, a case of possible autoimmune hepatitis was observed upon liver biopsy (1 subject in CVC Arm A, event not reported as an AE or SAE by the investigator). No cases of autoimmunehepatitis were observed during Year 2 of the study . There have been no deaths related to CVC treatment. Based on the results of CENTAUR, the Phase 3 AURORA study was initiated in April 2017 to study the antifibrotic benefit of CVC as compared with placebo in adults with NASH and Stage 2 or 3 fibrosis. CVC is currently also in Phase 2 development with prima ry sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) . Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J In over 1000 subjects treated, including those with NASH and liver fibrosis, HIV-1 infection, and cirrhotics with hepatic impairment, CVC demonstrated good safety M et al 2017, CVC IB) , supporting evaluation in combination therapy with tropifexor for the treatment of liver fibrosis associated with NASH. This study is the first study with a combination of tropifexor and CVC in patients with biopsy confirmed NASH and it aims to assess safety and tolerability as well as efficacy after daily dosing for 48 weeks . Tropifexor and cenicriviroc (combination) pre-clinical data A preclinical animal study investigating the potential additive effects of CVC and tropifexor in STAM mouse models of diet induced NASH, shows that combination therapy of tropifexor and CVC further improved steatosis, ballooning, and inflammation as measured by NAS vs. vehicle when compared to either agent as monotherap y (Laffitte B, AASLD 2017 The combination of tropifexor and CVC wasassociated with more pronounced reductions and hepatocellular ballooning .

The only effects noted during in-life phase were slightly decreased mean body weight and body weight change for males administered 1.0 mg/kg/day LJN452, alone or with 30 mg/kg/day CVC and slightly decreased food consumption for males administered 1.0 mg/kg/day LJN452 with 30 mg/kg/day CVC. Clinical pathology changes were seen primarily in animals administered LJN452 and consistent with the changes reported in previous studies with LJN452 and with the expected pharmacology of the drug. Most of the test-article related clinical chemistry effects may be associated with expected pharmacology of the test article(s). Clinical pathology changes in animals administered CVC included minimally to mildly lower absolute monocy te counts which was attributed to the pharmacology of CVC (CCR2 antagonism) and was not noted in animals administered L JN452 alone. Based on the microscopic findings, primary target tissues for LJN452 were the liver, kidney, and intestines as previously reported in other studies with LJN452 alone. These findings may be attributable to the pharmacologic activity of LJN452, as FXR is highly expressed in the liver, kidney , and intestines. Secondary findings, consistent with stress, were observed in the thymus and prostate in animals administered LJN452, which correlated with decreased individual and/or group thymus and prostate weights, respectivel y, as well as decreased individual terminal body weights. In conclusion, administration of CVC alone caused no microscopic findings indicative of toxicity and administration of CVC in combination with of LJN452 had no impact on toxicity of LJN452. CVC and LJN452 were administered incombination daily via oral gavage to rats for at least 13 weeks to assess the reversibility , persistence, or delay ed occurrence of any effects after an 8- week recovery phase ( Study 1984- T01- 052).

During the dosing phase, males administered 3/0.03 mg/kg/day (CVC/L JN452) gained slightly less weight compared to controls, while females gained more. Both effects reversed during the recovery phase. Several relativel y minor, CVC -and L JN452 -related cl inical pathology findings were observed at the terminal sacrifice in animals administered 3/0.03 mg/kg/day CVC/L JN452. These findings were (CCR2 antagonism/decreased monocy tes) or LJN452 (FXR agonism); those changes were similar to the one observed with the single agents (see above). At the terminal sacrifice, CVC -and LJN452 -related microscopic findings occurred in the liver, kidney , intestine (cecum, duodenum, and ileum) and the spleen. In the liver, minimal to moderate hepatocy te hypertrophy and periportal vacuolation was observed microscopicall y animals Higher correlated with females administered 3/0.03 the intestine, an increased incidence of crypt/gland ectasia was noted in the cecum, duodenum, and ileum animals administered incidence of basophilic tubules the cortex of males administered 30/0.5 mg/kg/day . Higher spleen weights correlated with the microscopic finding of increased marginal zone size in animals administered 30/0.5 mg/kg/d ay; this change is consistent with the effect of a pharmacological inhibition of CCR2 by CVC in the spleen (Flaishon 2004 et al). At the recovery sacrifice, no CVC and LJN452 -related microscopic findings were observ ed, indicating reversibility of the changes observed during the phase. The NOAEL is30/0.5 mg/kg/day CVC /LJN452 ) the toxicity findings observed during the single agent studies and the combination studies were similar. The changes in clinical pathology were either due to the CCR2 pharmacology (decreased monocy tes) or FXR agonism and were similar in the combination studies compared to the single agent studies. The primary target organs observed microscopicall y were the liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract and were similar in the combination studies compared to the single agent studies. The nature and the severit y of the findings in these organs were also similar. In addition, minimal to mild increased marginal zone in the spleen was obser ved after 13 weeks of treatment at 30/0.5 mg/kg/day CVC/L JN452. Although the mechanism of action has not been determined, this change is consistent with a pharmacological inhibition of CCR2 in the spleen (Flaishon 2004 et al) .The NOAEL in the 13 week study was the high dose of 30/0.5 mg/kg/day CVC /LJN452 . In conclusion, the findings in the 4 -and 13 -week combination therapies were aligned with the findings observed in similar studies with the single agents and/or with their expected pharmacology . Clinical tropifexor interaction Confidential Page 33 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J with CVC inclinical trials. Tropifexor and c enicriviroc and ood The tropifexor + CVC drug-drug interaction study CLJC242A2101 in health y subjects suggested that co-administration of CVC reduces tropifexor exposure (both Cmax and AUC 0 - 24h) by about 35% .No safet y concerns were identified at the doses of 60 \u00b5g tropifexor alone, 150 mg CVC alone or their combination, administered once dail y with a sta ndard breakfast for 14 days. In addition, anacross -study exploratory comparison indicated that tropifexor plasma exposure (both Cmax and AUC) at 60 \u00b5g administered fasted (study CLJN452X2101) is similar to that at the same dose administered following a st andard breakfast (study CLJC242A2101). In summary , as compared to the fasted status, a high -fat meal increases tropifexor exposure but a standard meal appears notto. It is recommended that NASH patients, in this study , will be dosed following a standard m eal without high fat (i.e. per AHA diet see appendix 17 ). Tropifexor and cenicriviroc (combination) -safety considerations In the DDI study (CLJC242A2101) the safet y and tolerability of th e combination treatment of tropifexor + CVC were found to be comparable to those of each of the mono therap y treatment. No additional particular safet y considerations are expected for the combination of tropifexor and cenicriviroc, beyond those previously observed for each of the indivi dual monotherapies (see section 1.1andsection 3.6for risks). As both drugs may increase liver transaminases, there is a potential fo r an additive effect, thus close liver monitoring is included. Diarrhea has been identified as a non-serious adverse effect for cenicriviroc and is a possible (but unconfirmed) adverse effect of tropifexor from animal studies. Tropifexor and cenicriviroc (combination) -rationale Due to the multifactorial etiology NAFLD/NASH and limited monotherapy results so far, thecombination therap y of compounds with different mechanisms of actions may provide more effective therap y for NASH patients. This study will preclinical animal study STAM mouse models of diet induced NASH, shows that combination therap y of tropifexor and cenicriviroc have additive effects on steatosis, ballooning, and inflammation . Both tropifexor and cenicriviroc as monotherapy are currently being evaluated in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials, respectivel y CLJN452A2202 and to date have shown improvements on biomarkers and in case of cenicriviroc improvements in liver fibrosis in NASH patients. In summary , these two drugs have different mechanisms of action (FXR and CCR2/5 inhibitor), and this multi target approach may lead to greater efficacy than monotherapy alone. Novartis Confidential Page 34 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 1.2 Purpose The purpose of this study is to assess the safety , tolerability , efficacy of two regimens compared to monotherapies tropifexor and CVC in patients with NASH a nd liver fibrosis.

The total study duration is up to 62 weeks. The screening period starts from the time of the signing of informed consent and continues for up to 10weeks when all inclusion/exclusion criteria have been evaluated and all baseline assessments have been performed. Patients are eligible to participate in the study if they have histological evidence of NASH and liver fibrosis stage 2 or 3 (NASH clinical research network (CRN) staging criteria) Novartis Confidential Page 38 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 3.2 Rationale for study design A Novartis sponsored Phase 2 trial (CLJN452A2202 ) is ongoing, with the purpose to identify the appropriate doses of tropifexor in patients with NASH , the tropifexor doses selected for this study are based on the currentl y planned doses being utili zed in that study (CLJN452A2202). The availability of long term non-clinical toxicity data supports the treatment duration with tropifexor up to 48 weeks and the inclusion of a histological endpoint (GLP -toxicology studie s of 13 weeks duration, and longer term GLP -toxicology of 26 weeks duration in rat and 39 weeks in dog studies (tropifexor IB) . For tropifexor monotherap y a long term efficacy study (CLJN452A2202) is ongoing, with 48 week treatment period and safet y follow -up to Week 52 which will provide the opportunity for evaluation of histological improvement by paired biopsies at Baseline and Week 48. Paired liver biopsies at baseline and at Week 48 will be included for all patients in this study. Inclusion criteria will require histologic evidence consistent with NASH and fibrosis level, F2 or F3 at baseline, based on liver biopsy (as determined by a central reader) obtained during the screening period or within 6 months before randomization. CVC at a dose of 150 mg once dailyis currentl y in Phase 3 (AURORA ) clinical development for the treatment of liver fib rosis in adults with NASH and in Phase 2 development in subjects with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Overall, over 1000 subjects have been exposed to CVC in both ongoing and completed studies ( CVC IB). ), adult patients with liver fibrosis and NASH were randomized. The recent data onCVC reported significant antifibrotic benefit in subjects with NASH, in addition to decreasing markers of s ystemic inflammation . All the available data for both compounds support the use of the tropifexor and CVC monotherapies and combination regimens for a total duration of 48 weeks. The current available reports of NASH monotherapy studies have been lacking significant efficacy . The expectation of a combined therapy is to improve efficacy based on the combination of different mechanisms of action. In this study we are combining a potent FXR (anti-steatotic, anti -inflammatory and anti -fibrotic) and a CCR2/5 inhibitor (anti -inflammatory and anti -fibrotic). The patient population will be described in more detail in Section 4 below . 3.3 Rationale for dose/regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment Tropifexor is currently being studied in NASH as monotherap y in study CLJN452A2202. The initial range of doses of 10 \u00b5g to 90 \u00b5g tropifexor studied in CLJN452A2202 Part A were chosen on the basis of safet y and likely pharmacological activit y, indicated by elevation of FGF19 up to 6 h after dosing in the First-in-Human CLJN452X2101 for study CLJN452A2202, upon review of CLJN452A2202 Part A data, recommended to investigate doses higher than 90 \u00b5g.

Tropifexor Based on the mechanism of action of tropifexor as a highl y potent and specific agonist of the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) and data acquired in the First-in-Human study CLJN452X2101 and in nonclinical toxicology studies the risk- benefit assessment of tropifexor is as follows: Transient and asymptomatic increases in ALT have been identified as an adverse reaction to tropifexor in healthy volunteers. Potential toxicities to be considered for tropifexor include more severe liver effects, gastrointestinal effects, coagulation effects, renal function abnormalities, and embry o-fetal toxicit y. In addition it is anticipated that tropifexor may have pharmacod ynamic effects on drug metabolism and elimination. Guidelines for the evaluation and detection of these potential toxicities and for their management and for minimization of risk if they do arise are discussed in the tropifexor Investigator's Brochure. Tropifexor treatment may have the anticipated benefits on biliary metabolism (reduced synthesis and increased detoxification), lipid profile (lowering triglycerides) and anti-fibrotic activiti es (reduced hepatic fibrosis) may improve pathophy siology and patient outcomes over longer term treatment in longer- term development studies. In addition to usual study monitoring, patients' liver tests will be followed closely , especiall y early in therap y, in conjunction with the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC ), including frequent checks of a liver safet y panel and drug dosage dose reduced or discontinued if necessary . Cenicriviroc CVC is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of liver fibrosis in adults with NASH and in Phase 2 development in subjects with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Overall, over 1000 subjects have been exposed to CVC in both ongoing and completed studies, with a maximum exposure available of 48 weeks of treatment in approximately 260 subjects. CVC doses ranged from 25 mg to 900 mg across all CVC studies. Study 652-2-203 ( CENTAUR )is an ongoing 2 -year placebo -controlled Phase 2b study in 289 adult patients with liver fibrosis and NASH. CVC demonstrated significant antifibrotic benefits in adult subjects with NASH, in addition to decreasing markers of systemic inflammation after only one year of treatment ( CVC IB ). Toxicology studies showed no target organ toxicity , thus no adverse liver findings, in mice or monkey s. In rats, the liver was the primary target organ identified in repeat dose studies, with biliary hyperplasia being the primary finding. Overall, the risk for hepatobiliary effects due to CVC appears to be low. The nonclinical data suggest that CVC will not adversel y affect the liver at or near clinical exposures. L iver f indings were present in only 1 of 3 species and when Novartis Confidential Page 42 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 4 Population The study population will consist of approximately 200 adult male and female patients with histologic evidence of NASH and fibrosis (stage 2 or 3 as per NASH CRN histological score, F2/F3) ; see Inclusion and Exclusion criteria for details.

Presentation: Bottles Novartis Confidential Page 46 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J Tropifexor Placebo: gelatin capsules Presentation: Bottles form: 150 mg coated tablet Presentation: CVC Placebo: Dosage form: coated tablet Presentation: Bottles Novartis will provide sufficient supplies of tropifexor and CVC to last each patient between visits (or more). 5.1.2 Additional treatment No additional treatment beyond investigational drug and placebo is provided in this trial. 5.2 Treatment arms Patients (n = 200) will be assigned at baseline visit to one of the following 4 treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 in a blinded manner. Placebo capsules/tablets will be given in each treatment arm where necessary to maintain blinding. Arm A: tropifexor 140 g, once -daily Arm once -daily g + CVC 150 mg , once -daily Arm D: tropifexor 90 g + CVC 150 mg , once -daily In order to maintain the blind, placebo capsules matching tropifexor 10, 30, 90 and 100\u00b5g capsules and placebo tablets matchin g CVC 150mg will be given to patients as indicated in Table 5-1, so that all patients will receive 3capsules and 1 tablet per day. One capsule/tablet from each of the 4bottles dispensed should be taken with food (e.g. immediatel y following a meal )and at about the same time each day . 5.3 Treatment assignment and randomization At baseline visit, all eligible patients/subjects will be randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) to one of the treatment arms. The investigator or his/her delegate will contact the IRT after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The IRT will assign a randomization number to the patient, which will be used to link the patient to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number for the first package of study drug to be dispensed to the patient. The randomization number will not be communicated to the caller. Novartis Confidential Page 48 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J If the subject fails to be treated for any reason, the IRT must be notified within 2 day s that the subject was not treated. The reason for not being treated will be entered on the appropriate eCRF. 5.5.2 Dispensing the study drug Each stud y site will be supplied with study drug . The study drug packaging has a 2-part label. A unique medication number is printed on each part of this label which corresponds to a certain treatment . Investigator staff will identify the study drug package(s) to dispense to the patient by contacting the IRT and obtaining the medication number(s). Immediately before dispensing the package to the patient, investigator staff will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the source document (Drug Label Form) for that patient's unique subject number. For patients who are unable to come to the study site for their end-of-treatment visit ( week-48) and the liver biopsy visit as schedule d per study protocol due to the COVI D-19 pandemic :-the investigator may consider to extend the study treatment to allow the visit (including liver biops y) to be performed later. This can be done using the following stepwise approach: The study medication dispensed at week 40 should have about 2 weeks' excess medication. The liver biopsy visit can be delay ed until the medication runs out. If this is not sufficient, an unscheduled visit can be performed (by phone if necessary ) and an additional 4-week supply of study medication requested via IRT and send the medication to patient's home address (if considered safe and appropriate). If feasible, central or local lab assessments (Liver tests, Serum BUN & Creatinine) should be performed ev ery 8 weeks to monitor the patient's safet y. If that is still not sufficient, a second 4-week supply of study medication can be requested via IRT . The Investigator should ensure that this study treatment extension is discussed with the impacted patients t horoughl y, including the possible risks and benefits of longer treatment duration. The discussion and the patient's willingness to extend the study treatment duration should be recorded in the source documents. 5.5.3 Handling of study and additional treatment 5.5.3.1 Handling of study treatment Study treatment must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safel y and properl y, and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and designees have access. Upon receipt, all study treatment must be stored according to the instructions specified on the labels. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. Technical complaints are to be reported to the respective Novartis CPO Qualit y Assurance. Medication labels will be in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of each country . They will include storage conditions for the study treatment but no information about the patient except for the medication number . Novartis Confidential Page 49 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study treatment in a drug accountability log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by monitors during site visits and at the completion of the trial. Patients/subjects will be asked to return all unused study treatment and packaging at each visit or at the time of discontinuation of study treatment. At the conclusion of the study , and as appropriate during the course of the study , the investigator will return all unused study treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the Novartis monitor or to the Novartis address provided in the investigator folder at each site. 5.5.3.2 Handling of additional treatment Not applicable. 5.5.4 Instructions for prescribing and taking study treatment Patients should be instructed to take the dose of study medication daily ,in the morning ,with food (e.g. immediatel y after a meal) at approximately the same time each dayexcept the days with a morning visit. On the days where there are study visits, ifthe visit is in the morning time, the patients should take their doses at the clinic following a meal. From the baseline day onwards , patients will be instructed to take 1 tablet and 3capsules each day during the duration of the study . The patient will be dispensed 4bottles for each 4 weeks period and should take o ne tablet from one bottle and 3capsules (one from each of the other 3bottles) . Table 5-1 Overview of treatment -type and number of capsules and tablets taken per 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 B 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 C 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 D 1 0 0 0 1 0 2 Dosing recommendations: Patients should take the medications in the morning with food (e.g. immediately after a meal) and at about the same time each day . Patients should be instructed to swallow the capsules whole and not to chew them. If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, no re- dosing of the patient is allowed before the next scheduled dose. Missed doses should not be made up. All kits of stud y treatment assigned by the IRTwill be recorded/databased in the I RT. The investigator must promote compliance by instructing the patient to take the study treatment exactly as prescribed and by stating that compliance is necessary for the patient's safet y and the Novartis Confidential Page 50 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J validity of the study . It should be emphasized to the patient that the study medication bottles are not identical; the patient must take one tablet or capsule from each bottle each day. The patient must also be instructed to contact the investiga tor if he/she is unable for any reason to take the study treatment as prescribed . 5.5.4.1 Dietary restrictions No alcohol consumption is allowed for 8 hours before each dose of study medication. Alcohol should also not be consumed for 8 hours before each study visit . To keep the fat intake as constant as possible, patients participating in this study will be instructed to carefully adhere to American Heart Association (AHA) diet or local equivalent if there is a country specific recommended diet (Appendix 5). Patients will be asked about dietary compliance to the AHA diet (or local equivalent) as outlined in Table 6 -1. Patients should also be counseled regardi ng appropriate exercise as per local standards, and will be asked about their exercise as outlined in Table 6 -1. 5.5.5 Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment For potential drug- related adverse events, temporary interruptions are permitted up to 28 consecutive day s. Study drugs can be reintroduced under careful monitoring if the investigator feels it is in the best interest of the patient. Interruption of study drug for more than 28 consecutive day s should lead to permanent discontinuation of the patient from study drug with the respective follow -up visits. Investigational treatment dose adjustments are not permitted. These changes must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. 5.5.6 Rescue medication Use of rescue medication is not allowed in this study . 5.5.7 Concomitant medication The investigator must instruct the patient to notify the study site about any new medications he/she takes after the patient was enrolled into the study . All medications, procedures and significant non-drug therapies (including physical therap y and blood transfusions) administered after the patient was enrolled into the study must be recorded in the appropriate e CRF. Each concomitant drug must be individually assessed against all exclusion criteria/prohibited medication. If in doubt the investigator should contact the Novartis medical monitor before randomizing a patient or allowing a new medication to be started. 5.5.8 Prohibited medication Use of the treatments displayed in the be low table ( Table 5 -2) is NOT allowed after the start of investigational drug. Novartis Confidential Page 51 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J Table 5-2 Prohibited medications Medication Guidance Inhibitors, inducers and sensitive substrates Herbal remedies and UGT inhibitors: diclofenac, probenecid, valproic acid Prohibited Strong Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors: gemfibrozil, clopidrog rel.Prohibited from intake to end -of-study visit Sensitive CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic index (i.e. drugs that should not be co -administer ed with weak CYP3A4 Sensitive CYP3A4 substrates exceptions: midazolam , triazolamUse only for sedation on the day of the liver biopsy or for surgical outpatient procedures. If given after intake of study drug, the first dose should be reduced by 50% of the recommended dose and titrated according to the desired clinical response. Sensitive CYP3A4 substrates exceptions: intravenous alfentanil or fentanylUse is allowed for sedation on the day of screening biops y but is not allowed for any procedure af ter intake of study drug. Sulfasalazine and methotrexate Prohibited from first drug intake to end -of-study visit Novartis Confidential Page 52 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J Medication Guidance Vitamin E Prohibited at doses > 400 IU/day 5.5.8.1 Drugs to be used with restrictions If required ,the medications specified on Table 5-3should be used with caution, at the lowest dose possible and for the shortest duration possible considering individual subject risk-benefit considerations. Clinical monitoring and dose titration are recommended t o achieve the desired clinical response. Other medications of a similar class should be considered if possible. Consult the individual medication prescribing information for additional guidance. Table 5 -3 Drugs that are allowed but must be taken with caution Medication Guidance Acid- reducing agents (H2receptor antagonists, proton - pump inhibitors)Acid reducing agents should be administered at least 2 hours after study drug administration. W hen possible, use of an H 2receptor antagonists (except cimetidine) or antiacids is preferred over a proton -pump inhibitor. It is recommended to start with the lowest dose of these agents and titrate acco rding to clinical response. H2receptor antagonists (e.g. famotidine or ranitidine) should preferably be given from 2 to 12 hours after administration of study drug at a dose that does not exceed doses comparable to famotidine 40 mg daily. Antiacids (e.g. alum or bismuth subsalicylate) should preferably be given at least 4 hours after administration of study PPIs (e.g., omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, rabepraz ole, or delansoprazole) should preferably be given approximately 3 hours after administration of study drug at a dose that does not exceed doses comparable to omeprazole 20 mg daily. Lipid lowering agents The maximum recommended daily doses of atorvasta tin, simvastatin, are restricted mg, simvastatin 10 mg , pravastatin 40 mg , and rosuvast atin 10 mg ; pitavastatin use is allowed without dose restriction. CVC may increase the exposure of rosuvastatin and simvastatin and patients taking these drugs concomitantly could be at increased risk for adverse effects. Monitor patients closely for sy mptoms of m yopathy or liver injury. PDE5 inhibitors The recommended starting doses for these CYP3A4 substrates are as follows: sildenafil 25 mg, tadalafil 2.5 mg and vardeafil 2.5 mg. Patients on medications specified in Table 5-4can be included if the dose has been stable for at least 1 month before the baseline biopsy (historical or performed during screening). A stable dose is defined as a dose within 25% of the baseli ne dose. No new use of the medications in Table 5-4is allowed between 1 month before the baseline biopsy and until Study Completion . Novartis Confidential Page 53 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J Table 5-4 Medications permitted only if dose is stable within 25 percent of baseline dose Medication Oral anti -diabetic medications such as pioglitazone, 5.5.9 Emergency breaking of assigned treatment code It is the investigator's responsibili ty to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to allow access to the IRT at any time in case of emergency . The investigator will provide: protocol number study drug name (if available) patient number In addition, oral and written information to the subject must be provided on how to contact his/her backup in cases of emergency, or when he/she is unavailable, to ensure that un -blinding can be performed at an y time. Study treatment must be discontinued after emergency unblinding. The appropriate personnel from the study site and Novartis will assess whether study treatment should be discontinued for any patient whose treatment code has been broken inadvertentl y for an y reason. 5.6 Stud y completion and discontinuation 5.6.1 Study completion and post- study t reatment A patient will be considered to have completed the study when the patient has completed the last visit planned in the protocol. Continuing care should be provided b y investigator and/or referring ph ysician based on patient availability for follow -up. The investigator must provide follow -up medical care for all patients who are prematurely withdrawn from the study, or must refer them for appropriate ongoing care. This continuing care for patients who complete 48 weeks of treatment may include enrollment in an extension study , if any , to allow for therapy beyond 48 weeks. For all patients who discontinue treatment early or who complete treatment and do not rollover to an extension study (if available), a safet y follow -up visit (visit EOS) should be conducted 4 weeks after last treatment (EOT, Week 48). The information to be collected at this follow up visit includes concomitant medications, adverse events, and laboratory samples, as detailed on Table 6-1. Novartis Confidential Page 54 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 5.6.2 Discontinuation of study treatment Discontinuation of study treatment for a patient occurs when study drug is stopped earlier than the protocol planned duration, and can be initiated by either the patient or the investigator. The investigator must discontinue study treatment for a given patient if, on balance, he/she believes that continuation would negativel y impact the risk/benefit of trial participation. Study treatment must be discontinued under the following circumstances: Patient wish Pregnancy (Ref. protocol Section 6.5.6 and Section 7.6) Use of prohibited treatment as per recommendations ( Section 5.5.8) Any situation in which study participation might result in a safet y risk to the patient Emergence of the following adverse events: Hypersensitivity reaction to tropifexor or CVC For ALT, AST, total bilirubin and/or alkaline phosphatase elevations mandating study treatment discontinuations ( Section 7.3 and Table 14 -1for further instructions and monitoring). Specified renal events ( Section 7.4 and Table 15 -1for further instructions and monitoring). Other SAE that are related to study drug. Other life-threatening SAE regardless of attribution to study drug . Any other adverse events, abnormal laboratory values or abnormal test result that indicate a safet y risk to the patient. Decompensated cirrhosis as defined b y ascites, bleeding esophage al varices, hepatic encephalopath y, jaundice or an y other liver decompensation related s ymptom. The appropriate personnel from the study site and Novartis will assess whether study treatment should be discontinued for an y patient whose treatment code has b een broken inadvertently for any reason. Study treatment must be discontinued after emergency unblinding. If discontinuation of study treatment occurs, the patient should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study. The patient should return to the clinic a s soon as possible, after discontinuation of study drug, for a study treatment discontinuation visit. Treatment discontinuation visit assessments detailed in the treatment discontinuation visit (TD) in Table 6-1should be completed and recorded in the appropriate eCRF. The investigato r must determine the primar y reason for the patient's premature discontinuation of study treatment and record this information on the appropriate eCRF. The investigator must a lso contact the IRT to register the patient's discontinuation from study treatment. During the Treatment discontinuation visit (TD) , at least the following data should be collected: new/concomitant treatments adverse events/Serious Adverse Events For patie nts who discontinue study treatment prematurel y before the end of the treatment period for any reason other than withdrawal of informed consent, the TD visit (EOT) and Week 52 (EOS) visits must be performed. Novartis Confidential Page 55 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J If stud y drug discontinuation occurs because tre atment code has been broken, refer to protocol Section 5.5.9. 5.6.3 Withdrawal of informed consent Subjects may voluntarily withdraw consent to participate in the study for any reason at any time. Withdrawal of consent occurs onl y when a subject: Does not want to participate in the study anymore, and Does not allow further collection of personal data In this situation, the investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) to understand the primary reason for the subject's decision to withdraw his/her consent and record this information. Study treatment must be discontinued and no further assessments conducted, and the data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing. Further attempts to contact the subject are not allowed unless safety findings require communicating or follow - up. All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. A final evaluation at the time of the patient's study withdrawal should be made as detailed in Table 6 - 1. Novartis/sponsor will co ntinue to keep and use collected study information (including an y data resulting from the analysis of a subject's samples until their time of withdrawal) according to applicable law. For US and Japan: All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal may still be used for further testing/analy sis in accordance with the terms of this protocol and of the informed consent form. For EU and RoW: All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal will no longer be used, unless perm itted by applicable law. They will be stored according to applicable legal requirements. 5.6.4 Loss to follow -up For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to discontinue or withdraw, the invest igator must show \"due diligence\" by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the subject, e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A patient cannot be considered as lost to follow -up until the time point of his/her planned end of study visit has passed. 5.6.5 Early study termination by the sponsor The study can be terminated by Novartis at any time for any reason. This may include reasons related to the benefit risk assessment of participating in the study , practical reasons, or for regulatory or medical reasons (including slow enrolment). Should this be necessary, the patient must be seen as soon as possible and treated as a prematurely discontinued patient. The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that Novartis Confidential Page 56 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient's interests. The investigator will be responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRBs/IECs) of the early termination of the trial. 6 Visit schedule and assessments Table 6-1lists all of the assessments and indicates with an \" X\" when the visits are performed. An 'S' indicates the data for that assessment are in the source documents at the site. Patients who have been screened and have a screening visit recorded in the IRT system at the time that the planned enrollment number is met will be allowed to enter the trial and to be randomized if they are eligible. Patients must be see n for all visits on the designated day, or as close to it as possible. Missed or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Patients who prematurel y discontinue the study for any reason should be scheduled for a visit as soon as possi ble, at which time all of the assessments listed for the final visit will be performed. At this final visit, all dispensed investigational product should be reconciled and the adverse event and concomitant medications reconciled on the appropriate eCRF. For patients who are unable to come to the study site for their scheduled visit due to COVID - 19 pandemic and related measures , consider to conduct patient study visits on schedule as a remote consultation (except the Week 48, End Of Treatment visit) and send the medication to patient's home adress (if considered safe and appropriate). At these visits, the occurence of AEs or SAEs, change in co -medications, study drug compliance, alcohol and AHA diet compliance should be determined. Patients with child bearing potential must be reminded to perform urine pregnacy test at home every 4 weeks. Any unplanned assessments for: Vital signs, ECG, Hepatitis serology, Liver tests, Serum BUN and Creatinine, Coagulation panel, Clinical chemistry panel, HbA1c, Urinaly sis and Serum pregnancy test must be recorded in the unplanned e CRF. For patients who discontinue study treatment prematurel y before the end of the treatment period for any reason other than withdrawal of informed consent, the Week 48, planned End of Treatment (EOT) and Week 52 End of Stud y (EOS) visits must be performed. If a patient refuses to return for these assessments or is unable to do so, every effort should be made to contact them, or a knowledgeable informant, by telephone or by sending appropriate correspondence (i.e. certified letter) immediately. At this contact, the safety (e.g. potential occurrence of AEs or SAEs) and the primary reason for the patient's premature withdrawal should be determined. Documentation of attempts to contact the patient should be recorded in the patient source documents. Refer to Section 5.6for additional details regarding procedures for patients who discontinue study treatment or prematurely withdraw. Patients will be contacted for safet y evaluations during the 30 days following the last administration of study treatment. Novartis Confidential Page 57 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J Patients who develop medicall y important laboratory abnormalities or medically important adverse events (AE) that are considered related to study drug will be followed bey ond the End of Study visit until these events have resolved or stabilized. The following will be considered as medically impo rtant: i. severe AEs , ii. serious AEs, iii. hepatic and renal AEs, iv. elevated liver enzy mes (AL T, AST or alkaline phosphat ase >2x ULN and >1.5x baseline).

Drug screen X X Study Com pletion Form X Novartis Confidential Page 65 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 6.1 Information to be collected on screening failures All patients who have signed informed consent and discontinue before randomization into the study at Baseline Visit are considered screening failures. If a patient discontinues before entering the treatment epoch, IRT must be notified within 2 days and thereason for not entering the study will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. In addition, the following eCRFs should be completed: Visit Date, Informed Consent, Demograph y, Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria, Subject Re-Screening (if applicable), Disposition, Withdrawal of Consent (if applicable) and AE should be completed for any SAEs that occurred during the screening epoch. Adverse events that are not SAEs will be followed by the investigator and collected onl y in the source data. If a patient is a screening failure, but is rescreened and subsequentl y enrolled, the reason for the original screening failure must be documented in the source documents. A new subject ID will be assigned to the patient. If for any reason the patient is a screen failure, the patient may be rescreened. There is no restriction on the number of times a potential patient may be rescreened or on how much time must pass from the date of screen failure and the date of rescreening. If a patient rescreens for the study, THEN the patient must sign a new I CF and be issued a new patient number prior to any screening assessment being conducted for the patient under the new screening patient number. For all patients, the investigator/qualified site staff will record if the patient was rescreened on the rescreening eCRF and any applicable screening numbers the patient was issued prior to the current screening number. The date of the new informed consent signature must be entered on the Informed Consent eCRF to correspond to the new screening patient number. Informed Consent for a rescreened patient must be obtained prior to performing any study -related assessment or collecting any data for the new Screening Visit. For rescreening, all screening assessments must be performed as per protocol. Investiga tors will have the discretion to record abnormal test findings on the medical history eCRF whenever in their judgment, the test abnormality occurred prior to the informed consent signature. 6.1.1 Pre-screening Prior to screening visit 1 optional pre-screening assessments may be carried out, including assessments and/or local laboratory tests (HbA1c, platelets, INR, total bilirubin, ALT, AST, Alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin as applicable) to assess patient eligibility for inclusion. Prior to any assessments being carried out the pre -screening informed consent form must be signed b y the patient. Only data related to SAE's causally related tostudy procedures (i.e. blood sampling) will be reported . All other data related to pre-screening will be recorded only in the source documentation. Novartis Confidential Page 66 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 6.2 Patient demographics/other baseline characteristics All baseline assessments should be performed prior to first study treatment administration. These may be in the screening period (e.g. demographics) or at the Randomization Visit (e.g. PROs), depending on the assessment. 6.2.1 Demographic Information Patient demographic data to be collected at screening on all patients include: age, gender, race, ethnicity and child -bearing potential (for females only ). 6.2.2 Medical history Any relevant medical history including surgical/medical procedures, protocol solicited medical history , and/or current medical conditions before obtaining informed consent will be recorded in the Medical History eCRF. Significant findings that are observe d after the patient has signed the informed consent form and that meet the definition of an AE must also be recorded in the AE eCRF (see Section 7.1 for the timeframe to record AEs during the screening period). Whenever possible, diagnoses and not sy mptoms will be recorded. Investigators will have the discretion to record abnormal test findings on the medical history eCRF whenever in their judgment, the test abnormality occurred prior to the informed con sent signature. 6.2.3 Alcohol history and assessments Any history of alcohol use will be recorded in the eCRF. Further, the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) will be administered to the patients at the screening visit 2 and as indicated inTable 6-1. At screening visit 2 the 10-item questionnaire will be used, whereas at the following visits, the shortened version (AUDIT- C), a 3 -item questionnaire will be used. 6.2.4 Smoking history The current and/or previous use of tobacco products will be recorded, as well as the estimated number of pack -years based on the approximate consumption per year. Non-smokers will be advised not to start smoking during the stud y. 6.2.5 Prior and concomitant medications Concom itant medications and prior medications taken over the 6 months preceding study enrollment will be captured at the screening visit, and updated at the baseline visit. 6.2.6 Liver evaluation 6.2.6.1 Liver biopsy Patients must have histologic evidence of NASH and liver fibrosis stage 2 or 3 (NASH clinical research network (CRN) staging criteria) demonstrated on liver biops y during the Screening period. Alternativel y, a historical biopsy can be used if performed within 6 months prior to screening, if: Novartis Confidential Page 68 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 6.2.8 Screening visit 2 -additional assessments The second screening visit should only be conducted if eligibility is confirmed at screening visit 1. Assessments for this visit include: Liver biopsy , and other non -lab assessments as indicated in Table 6-1. The period between screening visit 1 and the anticipated randomization / baseline visit isa maximum of 10 weeks. Screening visit 2 should be done at least two weeks prior baseline visit to allow sufficient time for liver biopsy central reading . A repeat of the liver test, INR as well as the serum pregnancy test (if applicable) . Both repeat tests should be in compliance with protocol requirements be fore randomization of the patient. 6.3 Treatment exposure and compliance All doses of st udy t reatmen t administration will b e recorded on th e app ropriate CR F page . Compliance wi llbe assess edby means of site and subject -specific drug accountability by Novartis st udy personnel during the site monitoring visitsusing m edi cationpack numbers, Drug Label Form information and information co llec tedbyIRT. 6.4 Efficacy All efficacy assessments should be performed prior to the administration of study treatment. The recommended order for the efficacy assessments is described below. All remaining study visits procedu res (e.g. laboratory samples collection, vital signs measurement, etc.) must be completed prior to administration of study treatment. Novartis Confidential Page 69 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 6.4.2 Liver tests ALT, AST, GGT, alkaline mes if 5'nucleotidase either GGT or total alkaline phosphatase is > ULN during study participation), total bilirubin, direct bilirubin and albumin will be assessed as indicated in Table 6-1. If the total bilirubin concentration is increased above 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, direct and indirect reactive bilirubin will be quantified. The methods for assessment and recording are specified in the laboratory manual. Some of the liver tests may be completed as part of the blood chemistry panel. 6.4.3 Coagulation tests Coagulation parameters including APTT, PT, INR and TT will be assessed as indicated inTable 6-1. The methods for assessment and recording are specified in the laboratory manual. Novartis Confidential Page 70 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 6.4.9 Liver biopsy Patients will have paired liver biopsies (Baseline and EOT, after 48 weeks of treatment). Fibrosis staging and scores of steatohepatitis markers (steatosis, ) will be determined by a Central Reader. Five (5) toeight (8) unstained liver biopsy sections, must be prepared and submitted to the central histopathologist who will confirm eligibility prior to randomization. If a suitable historical biopsy sample from which slides can be prepared is not available, the liver biopsy can be performed any time during the 10 week screening period, and should only be performed in subjects who fulfill Screening visit 1 inclusion criteria. Additional details regarding liver biopsy requirements can be found in the accompan ying central biopsy manual. Novartis Confidential Page 71 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 6.4.10 Appropriateness of efficacy assessments The secondary for this protocol include direct markers of NASH as measured by liverhistology . The secondary efficacy variables selected for this protocol are to detect clinically meaningful changes in liver fat, liver enzymes and indirect markers of NASH. Improvement in steatosis and fibrosis as determined by liver histology is recommended as a valid endpoint by regulators (Sany al et al 2016 ). . 6.5 Safet y Standard safet y parameters and measures will be collected including adverse events and serious adverse events according to definitions and process detailed in the protocol . 6.5.1 Physical examination A physical examination of the patient will be performed on patients according to the schedule defined in Table 6 -1. A complete physical examination will include the examination of general appearance, hydration status, skin, neck (including thyroid), eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, vascular and neurological systems. If indicated based on medical history and/or symptoms, rectal, external genitalia, breast, and pelvic exams will be performed. Information for physical examinations must be included in the source documentation at the study site. Signi ficant findings that are present prior to signing the Informed Consent Form must be included in the Medical History screen on the patient's CRF. Significant findings that occur after signing the Informed Consent Form which meet the definition of an AE must be recorded in the Adverse Event screen of the patient's CRF ( Section 7). Novartis Confidential Page 73 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J One sample of serum will be frozen and stored. This sample will be used to repeat study lab tests when needed. It may also be used for additional testing. 6.5.4.1 Hematology Red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), white blood cell (WBC )count, absolute differential WBC count, and platelet count will be measured as indicated in Table 6-1. 6.5.4.2 Clinical chemistry The following will be measured as indicated in Table 6 -1: Clinical chemistry : sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphate, urea nitrogen (BUN)/urea, serum acid, creatine kinase, total HbA1c. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will be calculated using the MDRD formula based on the patient's ageat the time of measurement, gender and race. At screening visit 1, the following assessments will be included: HbA1c, ferritin, transferrin saturation, iron, and if not historically available also ANA, ASMA, and AMA. Optional: If the investigator require s additional data to evaluate the current alcohol use of the patient at the screening visit, the carbohy drate deficient transferrin (CDT) test can be assessed using the central lab. Liver tests: see Section 6.4.2 Coagulation: see Section 6.4.3 6.5.4.3 Urinaly sis A clean -catch midstream urine sample (approx. 30 mL) will be obtained, in order to avoid contamination with epithelial cells and sediments, and allow proper assessments, as indicated in Table 6-1. Parameters to be evaluated by urine dipstick test will include specific gravity , pH, glucose, protein, bilirubin, ketones, nitrite, leukocy tes and blood. Standard microscopic evaluation of urinar y sediments will be performed if the urine dipstick test shows abnormalities. Spot urine for calculation of protein to creatinine ratio can be aliquoted from the clean -catch urine specimen. 6.5.5 Electrocardiogram (ECG) ECGs must be recorded after 10 minutes rest in the supine position to ensure a stable baseline. The preferred sequence of cardiovascular data collection during study visits is ECG collection first, followed by vital signs, and blood sampling. The Fridericia QT correction formula (QTcF) should be used for clinical decisions. Novartis Confidential Page 74 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J Single 12 lead ECGs are collected. The original ECGs on non- heat sensitive paper, appropriatel y signed, must be collected and archived at the study site .The original trace will be sent electronically for central review directl yfrom the ECG machine. A standard 12 -lead ECG will be recorded at the visits indicated in Table 6-1. All ECGs must be performed on the ECG machines provided for the study . All ECGs will be independently reviewed. Instructions for the collection and transmission of the ECGs to the independent reviewer will be provided in the ECG investigator manual. 12-lead ECG parameters (RR [Heart Rate], PR, QRS, and QT) are to be assessed. Each ECG tracing must be label ed with study number, subject initials, subject number, date and time, and filed in the study site source documents. In the event that a clinically significant ECG abnormality is identified at the site (e.g. severe arrhythmia, conduction abnormality of QTcF > 500 ms), the ECG is repeated to confirm the diagnosis and both ECGs sent to the core laboratory for expedited review if applicable. Clinically significant abnormalities must be recorded on the relevant section of the appropriate CRFs capturing medical history /Current medical conditions/AE as appropriate. 6.5.6 Pregnancy and assessments of fertility A positive test at Screening Visit and/or Baseline Visit is an exclusion criterion for participating in the study . The urine pregnancy test will be repeated every four weeks up to the follow up visit (see Table 6-1)including at week s 20, 28, 36,44 and during anytreatment extension period . The tests will be performed at the clinical center or at patient's home . In case of home pregnancy test, the patients will be provided with urine pregnancy testkits. The result must be provided to the investigator at next scheduled visit, incase of positive test the patient must contact investigator immediatel y. A positive urine pregnancy test after start of study drug requires immediate interruption of study drug until serum hCG is performed and found to be negative. If positive, the patient will enter the post- treatment follow up period. See also Section 5.6.2 . Additional pregnancy testing might be performed if requested by local requirements. 6.5.7 Appropriateness of safety measurements The safet y assessments selected are standard for this indication/patient population and have been used in previous trials in this indication or deemed appropriate based on non -clinical and early clinical experience. Patients are seen frequently during trea tment and will be assessed for safet y parameters 6.6 Other assessments No additional tests will be performed on patients/subjects entered into this study . Novartis Confidential Page 75 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 6.6.1 Clinical Outcome A ssessments 6.6.1.1 Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) Novartis Confidential Page 76 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J Trial feedback questionnaire This trial will include an anon ymized questionnaire, 'Trial Feedback Questionnaire' for subjects to provide feedback on their clinical trial experience. Individual subject level responses will not be reviewed by investigators. Responses would be used by the sponsor (Novartis) to understand where improvements can be made in the clinical trial process. This questionnaire does not collect data about the subject's disease, sy mptoms, treatment effect or adverse events Novartis Confidential Page 77 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J and therefore would not be trial data. Should any spontaneous information be colle cted about AEs, this would be transferred to the safet y database. 6.6.2 Resource utilization Not applicable. Novartis Confidential Page 78 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 7 Safety monitoring 7.1 Adverse events An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g. any unfavorable and unintended sign [possibly including abnormal laboratory findings -see below], symptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study until the end of study visit. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. In addition, all reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered an adverse eve nt irrespective if a clinical event has occurred. Novartis Confidential Page 79 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by non -directive questioning of the patient at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered b y the patient durin g or between visits or through physical examination findings, laboratory test findings, or other assessments. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: they induce clin ical signs or sy mptoms, they are considered clinically significant, they require therapy . Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non-typical in patient with underly ing disease. Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safet y of individual patient and identify ing adverse event s. Alert ranges for laboratory and other test abnormalities are included in Appendix 1 . Adverse events must be recorded in the appropriate CRF capturing AEs under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associa ted with them, accompanied by the following information: the severit y grade: mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities severe: prevents no rmal activities its relationship to the study treatment its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing an outcome of not recovered/not resolved must be reported. whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE -See Section 7.2 for definition of SAE) and which ser iousness criteria have been met action taken regard ing [investigational] treatment its outcome (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal; or unknown) All adverse events must be treated appropriately . Treatment may include one or more of the following: no action taken (e.g. further observation only ) [investigational] treatment interrupted/withdrawn concomitant medication given non-drug therap y given patient hospitalized/patient's hospitalization prolonged (see Section 7.2 for definition of SAE) Once an adverse event is detected, it must be followed until its resolution o r until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment must be made at each visit (or more frequently , if necessary ) of Novartis Confidential Page 80 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. Informatio n about common side effects alread y known about the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator 'sBrochure (IB). This information will be included in the patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed . Any new information regarding the safet y profile of the medicinal product that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an Investigator Notification or an Aggregate Safet y Finding. New information might requi re an update to the informed consent and has then to be discussed with the patient. The investigator must also instruct each patient to report any new adverse event (beyond the protocol observation period) that the patient, or the patient's personal physician, believes might reasonabl y be related to study treatment. This information must be recorded in the investigator's source documents; however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be reported to Novartis. 7.2 Serious adverse events 7.2.1 Definition of S AE An SAE is defined as any adverse event [appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing)] undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)) which meets any one of the following criteria: is fatal or life -threatening results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for: routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not asso ciated with any deterioration in condition elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling an y of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the patient's general condition is medically significant, e.g. defined as a n event that jeopardizes the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention. All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under \"medically significant\" if other seriousness criteria are not met. Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (Annex IV ,ICH-E12D Guideline). Novartis Confidential Page 81 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse (Annex I V,ICH-E12D Guideline) . Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is a lso considered a serious adverse reaction. 7.2.2 SAE reporting To ensure patient safet y, every SAE, regardless of causalit y, occurring after the patient has provided informed consent and until 30 days following the last administration of study treatment must bereported to Novartis safety within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Any SAEs experienced after the 30 day period after the last study visitshould only be reported to Novartis safet y if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treat ment. For patients who sign the pre-screening informed consent form, SAEs which occur after signature of this consent will only be captured if they are reported to be causally related with study procedures (i.e. blood sampling). All follow -up information f or the SAE including information on complications, progression of the initial SAE and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow - up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one must be reported separatel y as a new event. Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form; all applicable sectio ns of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough report. The investigator must assess the relationship of each SAE to each specific component of study treatment, (if study treatment consists of several components) complete the SAE Report Form in English, and submit the completed form within 24 hours to Novartis. Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requirements for signature are to be found in the investigator folder provided to each site. Follow -up informati on is submitted as instructed in the investigator folder. Each re-occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event must be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow -up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation. If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator's Brochure or Package Insert and is thought to be related to the study treatment a Patient Safety associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for health authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same stud y treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant Novartis Confidential Page 83 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J Rule out acute viral hepatitis Ty pes A, B, C, D, and alcoholic hepatitis; hy poxic/ischemic hepatopath y; autoimmune hepatitis and biliary tract disease Obtain a history o f exposure to environmental chemical agents These investigations can include serology tests, liver biopsy , imaging and pathology assessments, hepatologist's consultancy , based on investigator's discretion. Any cases of possible drug-related liver injury will be blindly adjudicated by a hepatologist with expertise in drug-related liver injury and as necessary reviewed by the DMC which includes additional hepatologists. Subjects who permanently discontinue study drug due to potential liver toxicity must be followed for close monitoring until abnormalities stabilize to baseline levels or baseline grade of abnormalit y and the subject is as ymptomatic. All follow -up information, and the procedures performed must be recorded on the appropriate CRFs. 7.4 Renal safety monitoring The following two categories of abnormal renal laboratory values have to be considered during the course of the study : Serum event: confirmed (after 24h) increase in serum creatinine of 25% compared to baseline during normal hy dration status Urine event new onset ( 1+), hematuria or gl ycosuria Every renal laboratory trigger or renal event as defined in Table 15 -1in Appendix 3 should be followed up by the investigator or designated personnel at the trial site as summarized in Appendix 3 . 7.5 Reporting of study treatment errors including misuse/abuse Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, patient or consumer (E uropean Medicines Agency definition). Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriatel y used not in accordance wit h the protocol. Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, which is accompanied b y harmful ph ysical or ps ychological effects. Study treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be collected in the appropriate CRF, irrespective of whether or not associated with an AE/SAE and reported to Safety only if associated with an SAE. Misuse or abuse will be collected and reported in the safet y database irrespective of it being assoc iated with an AE/SAE.

The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy must be recorded on the Pharmacovigilance Pregnancy Form and reported by the investigator to the local Novartis Patient Safet y department. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study treatment. Any SAE experienced during the pregnancy and unrelated to the pregnancy must be reported on a SAE form. Pregnancy outcomes should be collected for the female partners of any males who took study treatment in this study . Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be obtained from the female partner. 8 Data revie w and database management 8.1 Site monitoring Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator's meeting, a Novartis representative will review the protocol and data capture requirements (eCRFs) with the investigators and their staff. During the study , Novartis employ s several methods of ensurin g protocol and GCP compliance and the quality/integrit y of the sites' data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness ofpatient records, the accuracy of data capture / data entry , the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specificatio ns. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site's data may be performed by a centralized Novartis CRA organization. Additionally , a central analy tics organization may analyze data & identify risks & trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to Novartis Clinical Teams to assist with trial oversight. The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study , consisting of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or Novartis Confidential Page 87 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 9 (end- of stud y) anal ysis will be conducted on all patient data collected up to the Week 52 visit. The analysis will be conducted on all subject data at the time the trial ends. Any data analysis carried out independently by the investigator should besubmitted to Novartis before publication or presentation. 9.1 Analysis sets Screened set (SCR) - All patients who signed the informed consent. Randomized set (RAN) - All patients who received a randomization number, regardless of receiving trial medication. Full analysis set (FAS) -All patients to whom study treatment has been assigned*. Following the intent -to-treat (ITT) principle, patients are analyzed according to the treatment they have been assigned to at randomization. Safety set (SAF) -All patients who received at least one dose of study drug and have at least one post-baseline safet y assessment. Of note, the statement that a patient had no adverse events also constitutes a safety assessment. Patients will be analy zed according to the treatment recei ved. *excluding patients who were mis-randomized and did not take investigational drug. Mis- randomized patients are those who were not qualified for randomization, but were inadvertentl y randomized into the study . The number of patients in each anal ysis set will be presented by treatment group and overall for the screened set. 9.2 Patient demographics and other baseline characteristics Demographic variables and other baseline characteristics will be summarized for the FAS. Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) will be presented for continuous variables for each treatment group and for all patients (total). The number and percentage of patients in each category will be presented fo r categorical variables for each treatment group and all patients (total). In addition, all relevant medical history , and protocol solicited medical history will be summarized by treatment group. 9.3 Treatments The duration of investigational treatment exposur e (days) will be summarized by treatment group for the SAF, both descriptivel y (i.e. mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles, minimum and maximum) and by duration category (e.g. weeks). The proportion of patients with dose reduction will be presented b y treatment group. Medications will be identified using the WHO dictionary including ATC code and presented for the SAF. Prior medications are defined as an y medications taken prior to the randomization visit (regardless of whether they are stopped or continued after randomization). Concomitant medications and significant non-drug therapies are defined as those used during the double - Novartis Confidential Page 88 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J blind period. Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized by treatment group in separate tables. Medications will be presented in alphabetical order, by ATC codes and grouped by anatomical main group (the first level of the ATC code). Tables will also show the overall number and percentage of subjects receiving at least one drug of a particular ATC code and at least one drug in a particular anatomical main group. Concomitant medications that were prohibited as per protocol and given during the conduct of the study as well as significant non -drug therapies will be provided in separate tables. 9.4 Analysis of the primary variable(s) 9.4.1 Primary Variable(s) Safety (to be assessed in SAF): Occurrence of adverse events Occurrence of serious adverse events Occurrence of adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation Occurrence of adverse events of special interest Changes in Vital signs Changes in Laboratory data 9.4.2 Statistical model, hypothesis, and method of analy sis There are no pre-specified hypotheses and statistical models in this study. The methods to analyze the primary safety variables are outlined in Table 9-1. Table 9 -1 Primary variables and methods of analy sis Variable Method of analysis Occurrence of adverse events Summary table of absolute and relative frequency, overall and by preferred term Occurrence of serious adverse events Summary table of absolute and relative frequency, overall and by preferred term Occurrence of adverse events resulting in discontinuation or dose reduction of study treatmentSummary table of absolute and relative frequency, overall and by preferred term Occurrence of adverse events of special interest Summary table of absolute and relative frequency, overall and by type of AE as the risks are described for both tropifexor and CVC (risk definition for tropifexor are those that appear in in tropifexor and CVC IB) Changes in vital signs Descriptive statistics by visit Changes in Laboratory data Descriptive statistics by visit 9.4.3 Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations Imputation of incomplete adverse events start and end dates will follow standard conventions and will be described in detail in the statistical analy sis plan. Novartis Confidential Page 89 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 9.4.4 Sensitivity analy ses No sensitivity analyses are planned for the assessment of the primary variables. 9.5 Analysis of secondary variables 9.5.1 Efficacy variables An overview of the secondary efficacy variables and planned anal ysis is given in Table 9-2. Table 9 -2 S econdary efficacy variables and analy ses Variable Analysis At least a one point improvement of fibrosis Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test controlling for baseline fibrosis stage for each tropifexor + CVC combination vs. each monotherapy treatment, with supporting information from risk differences, odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals Resolution of steatohepatitis (as determined b y central pathologist)Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel controlling for baseline fibrosis stage for each tropifexor + CVC combination vs. each monotherapy treatment, with supporting information from risk differences, odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals There is a single secondary objective in this study which is to characterize the efficacy of tropifexor + CVC in patients with NASH with fibrosis stage F2/F3 as assessed by histological improvement after 48 weeks of treatment compared to monotherapies (tropife xor and CVC) relative to baseline biopsy . There are two estimands that will be used to evaluate this objective. The first estimand is the difference on the proportion of patients on the different tropifexor +CVC regimens who achieve at least a one point improvement in fibrosis at Week 48 compared to tropifexor and CVC monotherapy patients. It is assumed that anyone who does not have a Week 48 liver biopsy or does not remain on their randomized study treatment for at least 24 weeks (even if a Week 48 biopsy was obtained) will have their outcome imputed by multiple imputation (MI ). For subjects who remain on their randomized study treatment for at least 24 weeks, but discontinue study treatment prior to Week 48, available Week 48 biops y results will be used as observed. This is a hy pothetical strategy addressing the question \"what would be the outcome if subjects had stayed at least 24 weeks on treatment and a Week 48 biopsy had been obtained\". Treatment differences between tropifexor +CVC combination therapy and monotherapy with tropifexor or CVC will be evaluated using a Cochran- Mantel - Haenszel test controlling for baseline fibrosis stage (F2/F3). The estimand will be evaluated in the FAS population. The second estimand is the difference in the proportion of patients on the different tropifexor +CVC regimens who achieve resolution of steatohepatitis at Week 48 relative to baseline compared to tropifexor and CVC monotherap y patients. It is assumed that anyone who does not have a Week 48 liver biopsy result or does not remain on their randomized study treatment for at least 24 weeks will have their outcome imputed by multiple imputation (MI). The handling of intercurrent events (discontinuation of assigned treatment) is e quivalent to the first estimand as described above Treatment differences between tropifexor +CVC combination therap y and monotherapy with tropifexor or will be evaluated using a Cochran- Mantel - Novartis Confidential Page 90 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J Haenszel test controlling for baseline fibrosis stage (F2/ F3). The estimand will be evaluated in the FAS population. Due to COVID -19 pandemic, it may not be possible for patients to return on time for Week 48 visit to perform liver biopsy and according to drug dispensing plan in Section 5.5.2 , the Week 48liver biops ycan be delay ed by approximately 10 weeks. Since the purpose of the secondar y efficacy anal ysis is to evaluate the potential histological benefit of stud ytreatment , all biopsies obtained, including those from eligible patients after week 48 , will be included in the anal ysis. Sensitivity analyses : Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to account for delay ed Week 48 biopsies due to extended treatment under COVID -19 pandemic. Further details are to be described in the statistcal analysis plan (SAP). 9.5.2 Safety variables All safet y variables (i.e. adverse events, laboratory data, vital signs, and ECG) will be summarized by treatment for all patients of the safety set. Safet y variables which are part of the primary variables are listed in Table 9-1as well. Analy ses of the safety variables will be performed in the Safet y Set. 9.5.2.1 Adverse events Treatment emergent adverse events (events started after the first dose of study treatment or events present prior to the first dose of study treatment but increased in severity based on preferred term) will be summarized. AEs will be summarized by presenting, for each treatment group, the n umber and percentage of patients having experienced Any adverse event (AE), Any serious adverse event (SAE), Any adverse event by primary system organ class (SOC), Any adverse event by preferred term, Any adverse by severity , Any adverse event possibly related to study treatment (investigator assessment) , Any adverse event resulting in discontinuation of study treatment , Any adverse events of special interest for tropifexor or CVC treatment . Exposure adjusted tabulations of adverse events and tabulations of appropriate adverse events according to defined intervals will be provided as well. If a patient reported more than one adverse event with the same preferred term, the adverse event with the greatest severit y will be presented. If a patient reported more than one adverse event within the same primary system organ class, the patient will be counted only once with the greatest severity at the system organ class level, where applicable. A separate summary will be provided for deaths, if they occur during the course of the study . Novartis Confidential Page 91 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 9.5.2.2 Laboratory data The summary of safet y laboratory evaluations will be presented for the groups of laboratory tests (e.g. hematology , clinical chemistry ). Descriptive summary statistics for the change from baseline to each study visit will be presented. These descriptive summaries will be presented by test group, laboratory test and treatment group. Change from baseline will only be summarized for patients with both baseline and post baseline values. Relative and absolut e frequencies of patients with liver events as defined in Appendix 2 will also be provided, as well as shift tables based on the normal laborator y ranges. For the shift tables, the normal laboratory ranges will be used to evaluate whether a particular laboratory test value was normal, low, or high for each visit value relative to whether or not the baseline value was normal, low, or high. These summaries will be presented b y laboratory test category and t reatment group. The number and percentage of patients with clinically notable laboratory results after baseline will be presented. Clinically notable laboratory results, for those parameters where ranges are available. Only patients with laboratory results within the normal reference range from the central laboratory at baseline will be included in the tabulations. Safety laboratory parameters which are also part of the efficacy anal yses will be included in the safet y tables as well (e.g. liver enzymes, lipids). 9.5.2.3 Baseline definition Generally , baseline is defined as the last assessment before date and time of first administration of study drug; if only the date is available, the last assessment before or at the date of first administration of study drug will be used. For transaminases (ALT, AST, GGT ) and bilirubin, the baseline value will be calculated as the mean of the last two assessments before first administration of the study drug, which are usuall y those taken at the Screening 2 and Baseli ne visit (if a test was performed). 9.5.2.4 Vital signs Analy sis of the vital sign measurements using summary statistics for the change from baseline for each post-baseline visit will be performed. These descriptive summaries will be presented by vital sign and tr eatment group. Change from baseline will only be summarized for patients with both baseline and post-baseline values. Patients with notable vital signs as defined in Appendix 1 will be listed. 9.5.2.5 ECG ECG data will be summarized by treatment and visit (post -baseline ECGs are performed at Week 24 and Week 48). The Fridericia QT correction formula (QTcF) will be used for clinical decisions and for analyses. Notable QTcF values and changes from baseline w ill be summarized at Week 24 and Week 48. A notable value is defined as a QTcF interval of greater than 450 ms. The categories used for the change (increase) in QTcF are: 30 ms, > 30 to 60 ms and > 60 ms. Novartis Confidential Page 92 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 9.5.3 Resource utilization Data relating to resource utilization will be used for the purpose of economic evaluation which will be carried out and reported as a separate activity .

However, the assessment will be made based on the whole safet y profile and not on quantitatively formulated hypotheses for distinct parameters. Therefore the sample size is based on the feasibility with respect to expected speed of enrollment and duration of the study , not on formal statistical criteria . 9.8.1 Power considerations with given sample size for safety assessment Events with a true incidence of 30% and above are likely to be observed (almost 100% probability ) in a group of 50 patients (size of each treatment group). Events with true incidences below 10% down to 3% are still ver y likel y to be observed, while events are observed with less Novartis Confidential Page 95 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J than 50% probabilit y only if the true incidence is less than about 2.5% (Figure 9-1). It is noteworth y, however, that a single patient constitutes 2% in a sample of 50. Figure 9 -1 Binomial probability to observe an event with given sample size Probabilities of theincidence being below a certain threshold are plotted in Figure 9-2for a sample size of 50 patients when the event is observed in 0, 1, 2, ...,10 patients (assuming a beta distribution with prior shape parameters 0.33, 0.33). Novartis Confidential Page 96 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J Figure 9-2 Predictions for probability of event based on observed number For example, if 0 events are observed, the probability (Prob) that the incidence is 5% would be 98.7%. If an event is observed in one patient, the probability that the incidence is 5% would be 86.6%. Similarly , if an event is observed in 10 patients (one fifth), the probability that the incidence is 20% would be approximately 50% (calculated using R function pbeta). 9.8.2 Power considerations with given sample size for efficacy assessment To evaluate the effectiveness of tropifexor + CVC with respect to the proportion of pa tients who have at least a one point improvement in fibrosis at Week 48 compared to baseline (i .e, the response rate), one needs to consider the effect size that one is able to detect with respect to both tropifexor and CVC as monotherap y. For CVC, based on information from the CENTAUR Phase 2b st udy, Friedman 2017 ), it can be assumed that the monotherap y response rate at Week 48 in F2/F3 patients would be approximately 35% For tropifexor, a response rate of 42% i s assumed (best -case scenario) based on the interpolation of expected Week 72 response rate and assuming linear improvement over time For the combined effect of tropifexor + CVC it will be assumed that 75% of the efficacy for CVC will be added to the effe ct of tropifexor (i.e. a response rate of 69%) comparisons between tropifexor +CVC and CVC monotherapy a 2-group continuity corrected 2test of proportions with type error 0.10 (2-sided, no adjustment for multiple comparisons), a sample size of 50 per group results in a power of 95% (nQuery Advisor 7.0). Novartis Confidential Page 97 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) No. of proportions with type error 0.10 (2-sided, no adjustment for multiple comparisons), a sample size of 50 per group results in a power of 81% (nQuery Advisor 7.0). Further scenarios assuming different response rates for tropifexor and the magnitude of effect added to tropifexor by CVC are described in Table 9 -4.

In addition, upon study completion and finalization of the study report the results of this trial will be either submitted for publication and/or posted in a publicly accessibl e database of clinical trial results. 10.5 Qualit y Control and Quality Assurance Novartis maintains a robust Quality Management (QM) system that includes all activities involved in quality assurance and qualit y control, including the assignment of roles and responsibilities, the reporting of results, and the documentation of actions and escalation of issues identified during the review of qualit y metrics, incidents, audits and inspections. Audits of investigator sites, vendors, and Novartis sy stems are perfor med by Novartis Pharma Auditing and Compliance Quality Assurance, a group independent from those involved in conducting, monitoring or performing quality control of the clinical trial. The clinical audit process uses a knowledge/risk based approach. Audits are conducted to assess GCP compliance with global and local regulatory requirements, protocols and internal Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) , and are performed according to written Novartis processes. 11 Protocol adherence This protocol defines the stud y objectives, the study procedures and the data to be collected on study participants. Additional assessments required to ensure safet y of patients/subjects should be administered as deemed necessary on a case by case basis. Under no circumstances includin g incidental collection is an investigator allowed to collect additional data or conduct any additional procedures for any purpose involving any investigational drugs under the protocol, other than the purpose of the study . If despite this interdiction, da ta, information, observation would be incidentally collected, the investigator shall immediately disclose it to Novartis and not use it for any purpose other than the study , except for the appropriate monitoring on study participants. Investigators ascerta in they will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. If an investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by Novartis and approved by the IR B/IEC and health authorities, where required, it cannot be implemented. 11.1 Protocol amendments Any change or addition to the protocol can onl y be made in a written protocol amendment that must be approved by Novartis, health authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC prior to implementation. Only amendments that are intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients/subjects may be implemented immediately provided the health authorities are subsequently notified by protocol amendm ent and the reviewing IRB/IEC is notified. Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol amendments, the investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the safet y of any patient included in this Novartis Confidential Page 100 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J study , even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. In such cases, the reporting requirements identified in Section 7 Safety Monitoring must be followed. 12 References References are available upon request Abdelmalek (2017) Favorable safet y and tolerability of the dual CCR2/5 antagonist cenicriviroc in over 66(S1), 1177A.

Novartis Confidential Page 103 Amended Protocol Version 03 (Clean ) Protocol No. CLJC242A2201J 13 Appendix 1: Clinically notable laboratory values and vital signs The central laboratory will flag laboratory values falling outside of the normal ranges on the central laboratory reports. Investigators are responsible for reviewing these abnormal values for clinical significance, signing the laboratory reports to indicate their review, and reporting values considered clinically significant inthe appropriate eCRF. Any clinicall y significant abnormal laboratory value should be evaluated and followed-up by the investigator until normal or a cause for the abnormality is determined. SEE APPENDIX 2 FOR SPECIFIC LIVER EVENT AND LABORATORY TEST TRIGGER DEFINITIONS AND FOLLOW -UP REQUIREMENTS. For ECGs, a notable QTc value is defined as a QTcF (Fridericia) interval of >450 msec for males or > 460 msec for females, all such ECGs will be flagged by the Central CRO and require assessment for clinical relevance and continuance of the patient by the Investigator.

Good practices include weight loss, reducing simple carbohy drates at the expense of increasing dietary fiber, eliminating industrial- produced trans fatty acids , restricting fructose and saturated fatty acids, implementing a Mediterranean- style diet, and consuming marine - derived omega -3 PUFA. AHA recommends the following: Eat a variet y of fruit and vegetable servings every day. Dark green, deep orange, or yellow fruits and vegetables are especially nutritious. Examples include spinach, carrots, peaches, and berries. Eat a variety of grain products every day. Include whole -grain foods that have lots of fiber and nutrients. Examples of whole grains include oats, wh ole wheat bread, and brown rice. Eat fish at least 2 times each week. Oily fish, which contain omega -3 fatty acids, are best for your heart. These fish include tuna, salmon, mackerel, lake trout, herring, and sardines. Stay at a healthy weight by balancing the amount of calories you eat with the activity you do every day. If you want to lose weight, increase your activity level to burn more calories than you eat. Eat foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Try to choose the following foods: Lean meats and meat alternatives like beans or tofu Fish, vegetables, beans, and nuts Nonfat and low -fat dairy products Polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats, like canola and olive oils, to replace saturated fats, such as butter Read food labels and limit the amount of Trans fat you eat. Trans fat is found in many processed foods made with shortening or with partiall y hydrogenated or hydrogenated vegetable oils. These foods include cookies, crackers, chips, and many snack foods. Limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 mg of sodium a day (about one teaspoon). Choose and prepare foods with little or no salt. Limit alcohol intake to 2 drinks a day for men and 1 drink a day for women. Limit drinks and foods with added sugar. "}
