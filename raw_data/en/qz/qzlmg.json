The following document will serve as South Dakota's Essential Health Benefits (EHB) Benchma rk plan as required in 45 CFR 156.100. Individual and small group market issuers in South Dakota may need to conform plan benefits to meet applicable federal and state EHB requirements when designing plans that are substantially equal to this EHB benchmark plan. Since the inception of the ACA, federal guidance has allowed each state the opportunity to select their benchmark from 10 possible plans: The largest plan by enrollment in any of the three largest products by enrollment in the state's small group market; Any of the largest three state employee health benefit plan options by enrollment; Any of the largest three national Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) plan options by enrollment; The Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plan wit h the largest insured commercial non- Medicaid enrollment in the state. Absent a selection by the state, the largest small -group plan has served as the benchmark plan from 2014- 2020. Further, t he Affordable Care Act requires non- grandfathered health plans in the individual and small group markets to cover essential health benefits (EHB), which include items and services in ten benefit categories. HHS regulations (45 CFR 156.100) define EHB based on state -specific EHB benchmark plans, which apply to individual and small group ACA compliant plants. For plan year 2020 and after, the Final 2019 HHS Notice of Benefits and Payment Parameters provides states with greater flexibility by establishing standards for States to update their EHB benchmark plans. CMS is providing States three new options for selection starting in plan year 2020, including: Option 1: Selecting the EHB -benchmark plan that another State used for the 2017 plan year. Option 2: Replacing one or more categories of EHBs under its EHB -benchma rk plan used for the 2017 plan year with the same category or categories of EHB from the EHB -benchmark plan that another State used for the 2017 plan year. Option 3: Otherwise selecting a set of benefits that would become the State's EHB - benchmark plan. The South Dakota Division of Insurance (DOI) is utilizing the greater flexibility granted by CMS in Option 3 to update their EHB benchmark plans to help address the gaps in treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorder(s) for plan year 2021. Under Option 3, the S tate is allowed to develop its benchmark plan by selecting a set of benefits rather than an existing plan offered in the market. Therefore, in the process of developing the 2021 EHB benchmark plan, the South Dakota DOI started with the 2020 EHB benchmark a s the basis and added one new benefit. As required per federal regulation, the South Dakota DOI submitted an actuarial report and certification that demonstrates the proposed 2021 EHB benchmark plan meets the following two actuarial requirements: 3 1. The EH B benchmark plan must be equal to, or greater than the scope of benefits provided under a typical employer plan; and 2. The EHB benchmark plan does not exceed the generosity of the most generous among the plans listed at Section 156.111(b)(2)(ii). The first requirement states the EHB benchmark plan must be equal to or greater than the scope of benefits provided under a typical employer plan. The starting point for the proposed benchmark is the current 2020 benchmark, which is one of the most popular small group plans offered in South Dakota. Further, since it is the current 2020 benchmark plan, it already meets the criteria of being equal to or greater than a typical employer plan. The SDDOI has elected to add one benefit or criteria to the 2020 benchmark plan. Since the SDDOI is enhancing the plans, the proposed benchmark continues to meet the criteria of the first requirement. The second requirement states the EHB benchmark plan does not exceed the generosity of the most generous among the plans listed at Section 156.111(b)(2)(ii). To demonstrate compliance with this requirement, we performed a cost study on each of the recommendations to determine the materiality of the new benefit or criteria and the impact it would have on the overall premiums of the benchmark plan. For more information, please see the detailed actuarial report from Leif Associates. The Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program ( FEDVIP ) plans are the supplemental benchmark plans designated by the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO)/Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)for guidance in pediatric dental and vision benefit coverage . The current FEDVIP plans for dental and vision are the MetLife Federal Dental Plan (High Option) and FEP BlueVision (High Option). See https://www.cms.gov/CCIIO/Resources/Regulations -and-Guidance/Downloads/Top3ListFinal -5-19- 2015.pdf . South Dakota w ill use the same approach as outlined in 45 CFR \u00a7156.122(a)(1) and (2) for its drug benefit. Issuers may not have to cover the specific drugs listed on the benchmark drug list but are required to fill any empty/deficient categories and must meet the drug category/class count standard as established by CMS. The State of South Dakota has not included any additional EHB benefits pursuant to 45 CFR 155.170. Nothing in this 2021 Benchmark plan should be construed as additional EHB requirements under Federal Law. At no time shall the set of benefits listed below be construed to allow an issuer to NOT cover any and al l federal and state required benefits. 4 Contents 1.
