As to the last of the three, a small group of black men and women \u2014 gay, lesbian and straight \u2014 have officially served notice: We will no longer remain silent, no longer stay invisible, no longer tolerate homophobic abuse. And when we work within the black community for our mutual concerns, we do so on one condi\u00ad tion: recognition of our fullest humanity as proud black lesbians and gays. This was the message of a historic forum held June 27 at San Francisco's Booker T. Washington Community Center, the oldest or\u00ad ganization of its kind serving the city's black population. The choice of this landmark was de\u00ad liberate, for it conveyed symbolically the desire of black lesbians and gays to be active, visible participants in the Bay Area's black com\u00ad munities. The forum was organized by Pat Norman, community activist and health educator, and Ken Jones, director of volunteer services at the San Francisco AID S Foundation. Their work began in response to an all too common inci\u00ad dent. \" At a recent meeting in the black community, chaired by black civic leaders,\" Norman related C o n tin u ed on p a g e 12--------- -------------------- - Molinari Co-Chair Resigns pg. 7 500 Hayes Street, San Francisco, C A 94102 415-861-8100 Vol. 15, No. 28 Ju ly 10. 1987 M ILK M URAL MADNESS Artist Johanna Poethig Has Her Back Against A Bare Wall by Bob Marshall Johanna Poethig isn't about to take this lying down.

HARVEY MILK TOLD US ABOUT THE NAVY KICKING HIM OUT FOR BEING GAY. BUT SOME PEOPLE WEREN'T LISTENING. Supervisor John Molinari championed an agreement with the Navy that would have discriminated against lesbians and gay men in new San Francisco jobs brought by the USS Missouri. Art Agnos had to tell him that was wrong. John Molinari said he was skeptical that the Navy and Department of Defense discriminate. Art Agnos found out they do. The National Gay Rights Advocates found out they do. Lambda Legal Defense found out they do. Maybe one of the reasonsjohn Molinari doesn't know about discrimination is that he has never, in 14 years, hired a lesbian or gay man to work with him in city government at City Hall. Maybe one of the reasons Art Agnos knew the truth is because he has always had lesbians and gay men on his staff working on discrimination and other issues im portant to the community. John Molinari should have known better .. .but he didn't bother to check. Art Agnos did. And that's the difference. Harvey Milk Lesbian a n d Gay Democratic Club Hon. Tom Nolan \\ Hon.

One of 16 H IV patients in LAM C's A ID S ward, Steinhorst is in the process of receiving a medical board, a series of medical exams and consultations to deter\u00ad mine the medical benefits a soldier will receive when he or she is medically discharged from the army. Once so weak that he had to receive physical therapy to learn how to w alk again, the pink-cheeked Steinhorst is now robust, healthy, and finding it hard to sq u eeze back into his m ilitary uniform .Training as a finance clerk, Stein\u00ad horst joined the army in June 1 9 8 1 following graduation from Van Buren Vocational School in San Francisco. After basic training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, and Advanced In\u00addividual Training at Fort Benjamin, In\u00ad diana, he was assigned to US Army Garrison (USAG) on the Presidio of San Francisco. Steinhorst was then sen t to the 1 8 th Finance Section in Frank\u00ad furt, Germany, and then to Vint Hill Farms Station, Virginia. He returned to th e Presidio as a patient at LAMC on May I. Steinhorst w as diagnosed with AIDS while at USAG in 1 9 8 2 . He had no com m ent on how he may have con\u00ad tracted the d isease. Doctors at first thought he had a flu or hepatitis, because he was experienc\u00ad ing rapid w eight loss, constant fevers, nausea, and d izzin ess. Tests revealed, however, that he had the AIDS virus and a low T-helper cell count. His first bout with the illness kep t him in the hospital for four m onths. Since then, however, h e has suffered only from com m on colds and sinusitis. Because he has b een well since his in\u00ad itial illness, h is m edical treatm ent has been m ostly preventative or m ainte\u00ad nance. He is given tests regularly to check T -cell counts, blood level, and h islungs. LAMC also offers stress therapy including instruction in breathing and relaxation techniques, group therapy sessions with social workers and psychiatrists, physical therapy, and in\u00ad struction in m em ory exercises to counteract neurological effects of th e vims. Early last m onth, Steinhorst w as put on an experim ental program testin g Fansidar, a drug that is supposed to prevent pneum ocystis pneum onia. He was planning to be on the program for three years, but because of an adverse reaction to the drug, h e quit the pro\u00ad gram this w eek. To stay healthy, h e takes vitam in C and B-com plex vitam ins. Steinhorst says he plans to work forfound out, I didn't think anyone w ould com e and see m e in the hospital b ecause I had contracted shingles on m y face. So |I thought| they |wou!dn't| want to see me because I looked so pathetic.. .or.. ,|because I had AIDS). \"In an office of 80 people, 70 of them came to visit m e in the hospital, and that w as every day. They all took turns com ing to s e e m e. They didn't treat m e different; they treated m e as they had in th e past. \"When I w ent to Walter Reed |M edi- cal Center in Washington, D.C.| \u2014 I was there for two m onths before I w ent to m y duty station in Virginia \u2014 nobody knew there except for m y com\u00ad m ander and m y first sergeant. They \"In an office of 80 people, 70 of them came to visit me in the hospital, and this w a y every day. \" \u2014 W ayne Steinhorst the m ilitary as a civilian after his retire\u00ad m ent. \" I'm still able to work. I'm very healthy even though I've contracted a few problem s |such as| a lower T -cell count,\" he explains. \"But m y body is still able to fight off infections quite well.\" Although Steinhorst has not experi\u00ad enced m uch harassm ent in the army, h e says he b elieves it will be easier to w ork as a civilian for the m ilitary than as an enlisted p erson . \"In the military, if you're HIV- positive it's a little m ore difficult because you have the strain of the con\u00ad fidentiality, so to speak, w here [b ein g in| the military can harm you m ore because people can harass you. But as a civilian, harassm ent m eans law suits, if I'm not m istaken, if you're b ein g harassed by your superiors.\" Until late last year, Steinhorst kept h is condition a secret. When th e diagnosis w as revealed to his co\u00ad workers, he got a m uch warm er res\u00ad ponse than he expected. \" Nobody knew from '82 to October '86 except for my doctors in Frankfurt and here at the Presidio. But when theydidn't treat m e any differently from any other soldier. As far as confidentiality went, they kept it within the office. Whatever w as said behind closed doors stayed there. If I ever had a problem , 1 could go to them.\" Steinhorst said h e was not scared of others finding out because the p ost com m ander had an anti-discrim ination policy \" which is pretty universal within the army\" prohibiting harassm ent of HIV-positive soldiers and specifying punishm ent for those who disobey. \" A few people harassed m e at Vint Hill Farm,\" says Steinhorst, \"but I just didn't pay attention. I gave the nam es to m y com m ander and he took care of it.\" For now, Steinhorst is taking it easy. While he awaits the conclusion of th e m edical board, which could take up to eight m onths, h e keeps busy looking for an apartm ent, shopping for furniture, and job-hunting. The greatest factors in keeping h is good health, says Steinhorst, have been his com m itm ent to fight the virus and his positive m ental attitude. \"Three things have really kept m e go\u00ad ing. That's m y three H's: Hope, Humor, and Honesty!\" But Slashes $22 Million Duke OKs $63 Million AIDS Budget by Caden Gray Governor Deukmejian agreed Tuesday to spend $63 million on programs to combat AID S during the 1987-88 fiscal year. That is twice as much as the state of California is spending now, but $22 million less than the legislature would like to spend.Coors Drops Lawsuit by George Mendenhall Coors Brewery has dropped its five-year lawsuit against gay labor leader Howard Wallace, AFL-CIO boycott leader David Sickler, and the AFL-CIO Coors Boycott Committee. Deukmejian originally proposed spending $ 4 5 m illion. The legislature dem anded that h e spend m ore, particularly on education. Lawmakers added S39 m illion to th e governor's budget, hoping to convince him to spend a total of S85 m illion. Deukm ejian signed the budget Tues\u00ad day, but not before vetoing $22 m illion from the proposed AIDS funding. He cut SI 1 .5 m illion from education; $8.6 m illion from patient care including $2.5 million from m ental health care; alm ost $ 1 m illion from testing and surveillance; $ 1 m illion from intra\u00ad venous drug user education and treat\u00ad m ent; and alm ost a half m illion that would have been u sed by California's Com m ission on AIDS that doesn't e x ist yet, but will if Assem bly Bill 8 7 by Assemblyman Art Agnos (D-SF) becom es law . In his veto m essage the governorsaid, \" I have m ore than doubled California's com m itm ent to AIDS pro\u00ad gram s. The funding level w hich I have sustained is both significant and ap\u00ad propriate.^ The final AIDS b udget leaves $1 5.5 m illion for research; alm ost $ 1 3 m illion for case m onitoring, testing, and sur\u00ad veillance; $ 1 3 m illion for education; $ 8 m illion for patient care including $7 00 ,0 0 0 for m ental health care; $5.7 million for the construction of a re\u00ad search and treatm ent laboratory at San Francisco General Hospital; $ 3 .5 m illion for educating intravenous drug users about AIDS and treating those al\u00ad ready infected; $ 3 million for adm inis\u00ad trative purposes; and nothing for the California Com m ission on AIDS. In light of a total state b udget of $ 4 0.5 billion and cuts am ounting to $ 6 63 m illion that will devastate m any essential program s including the Cal-OSHA worker safety program and hos\u00ad pital traum a centers throughout the state, cutting $ 2 2 m illion from the AIDS budget is a com paratively sm all sacrifice. But according to Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti (D-Los Angeles), $ 6 3 m illion is not enough. \"The slow ness in dealing with a cure, in dealing with a vaccination, in dealing with education, in dealing with treat\u00ad m ent, is directly attributable to th e governor,\" said Roberti. \" He's respon\u00ad sible for the delays.\" Roberti aide and AIDS exp ert Stan Hadden exp ressed concern that the final budget generously appropriates $ 1 3 m illion for establishing alternate test sites and related testing ex p en ses but only $700,000 for m ental health care. Haden said there is an alarm ing discrepancy betw een the am ount that will be sp en t testing people and th e am ount that will be sp ent taking care of the people who are em otionally and psychologically devastated because they have tested positive. \" Seven hundred thousand dollars is not going to m eet the need s of the peo\u00ad ple affected by AIDS,\" Hadden said. \" I think [another| area that is partic\u00ad ularly neglected in this budget is patient care,\" he said. Deukm ejian cut $8.6 m illion from care million ear\u00ad m arked for HIV-infected children, leav\u00ad ing $ 1 .1 m illion for the children and $6.8 million for everybody else. C o n tin u e d on p a g e 11Coors su ed Wallace, Sickler and the Com m ittee after KQED-TV canceled Coors Day during the 1 981 auction to raise funding for San Francisco's public television station. Wallace successfully convinced sta\u00ad tion m anagem ent to drop Coors Day because of th e com pany's alleged history of discrimination against m inorities. Coors charged th e AFL- CIO Boycott Com m ittee with threaten\u00ad ing the station with a disruption of th e auction. Wallace denied those charges. The original suit included a now defunct gay group called Solidarity. The brewery had attem pted to obtain the organization's m em bership list. It later dropped Solidarity from its leg al actions after it lost tw ice in federal courts and took its suit into state court. The defendants state in the settlem ent that they will not \"threaten violence or physical harm\" against Coors, nor will they conduct m ass picketing to disrupt Coors operations. All parties stipulate in a Superior Court decree that there shall \" not be anadm ission by any part of the truth or falsity of any claim or d efen ses m ade in the court of this litigation.\" Part of th e agreem ent prohibits all parties from discussing the nature of the charges brought by Coors. City councils in New York City, Boston, Detroit, and Santa Cruz have recently passed boycott resolutions. Supervisor Harvey Milk helped organ\u00ad ize th e local gay boycott against Coors in 1 9 7 6 . The gay involvem ent began when striking Golden, Colorado, em ployees claimed they had been asked questions on a polygraph (lie detector) test at Coors about their sexual orienta\u00ad tion. Much of the boycott centered on the political activities of the Coors fam i\u00ad ly, a major force in politically right, anti-gay politics. Racial minority groups had similar boycotts against th e company, charging discrim ination in hiring. An estim ated 1 0 0 Bay Area gay bars and restaurants still honor the boycott because of the Coors family's support C o n tin u ed on p a g e 9c San Francisco Sentinel July 10, 1987 3 The sense of isolation in the gay community connected so strongly with my own experiences, that I knew my lutuie included Shanti.

Fighting Doolittle: Optimism Amidst Chaos by George Mendenhall California's full-time gay lobbyist, Rand Martin of Lobby for Individual Freedom and Equality (L IF E ), is in the forefront of fighting State Senator John Doolittle (R-Rocklin), who is - pushing a package of A ID S bills in Sacramento. This week Martin encouraged les\u00ad bians and gays to support the new Stop Doolittle effort launched last w eek in San Francisco. He also answered charges that som e of his recent lobby\u00ad ing efforts have been less than effec\u00ad tive.Last year a num ber of AIDS bills opposed by the lesbian/gay communi\u00ad ty w ere defeated in com m ittee. Martin blam es this year's successful effort to pass som e of that legislation out of com m ittee on Doolittle. \"There is a new sense of concernabout doing som ething about AIDS. Testing, many legislators believe, is a short term response to the epidemic \u2014 even though it may not be effective. It is som ething the legislators can point to,\" Martin told th tien lm el. \"They . believe that testing will give an indica\u00ad tion of the extent of the epidem ic and people who learn they've tested pos\u00ad itive will change their behavior.\" Senator (D-Los An\u00ad geles) believes what Doolittle \"is try\u00ad ing to do is make it a crime to have AIDS. He is trying to criminalize an illness.\" Watson believes, \" We Dem\u00ad ocrats let the issue slip away. I see the legislature rushing down a road blind\u00ad ly. It's just flailing out in the dark, and I think it can get us into serious trou\u00ad ble.\" Two of the organizers of Stop Doolittle are attem pting to halt the tide this week. Paul Boneberg, Mobiliza\u00ad tion Against AIDS, and Ralph Payne, San Francisco California AIDS Net\u00ad work (CAN), believe the seven bills could pass out of their com m ittee, pass the assem bly, and be signed by the governor. They are traveling outside of the city this w eek to rally forces against this happening. Their new ad hoc group is asking for educational and travel funds.

The Doolittle bills would put into law LaRouche-type m easures. They would allow health officials to be told of a person's positive AIDS test result \u2014 without written consent; require that the AIDS test be recom m ended to m arriage license applicants; m ake it a felony for a person who tests positive to give blood; give additional jail tim e to a \"positive\" person who perform s a sex crime; require tests for all prison inm ates and those in m ental hospitals \u2014 segregating those who test positive; and require a test for all convicted prostitutes.

If only a m odest percentage of California taxpayers participate, this credit could easily generate over $ 2 0 0 million for scientific research to stop the spread of AIDS and m ost hopefully, find a vaccine, cure or treatm ent.\" \"By 1 9 9 1 , California will spend over $ 5 billion in the fight against AIDS,\" added Klehs. \"Our proposed tax credit will allow taxpayers to directly par\u00ad ticipate in the battle to elim inate the trem suffering and huge finan\u00ad cial burden that confronts us.\" To date, there are 8,027 reported cases of AIDS in California, up from 7 0 cases in 1 9 8 1 . In March 1 9 8 6 , th e Departm ent of Health Services pro\u00ad jected a cum ulative total of 2 3,500 reported AIDS cases and 14 ,9 00 deaths by the end of 1 9 8 9 , m aking AIDS the seventh leading cause of death in California by the end of this decade. By the end of 1 9 9 1 , according to the US Centers of D isease Control, the cum ulative num ber of AIDS cases w ill rise to 5 0,000 with approxim ately 3 4,000 deaths in California, m aking AIDS the fifth leading cause of death for that year. Treating th ese AIDS patien ts will cost California m ore than $ 5 billion by th e end of 1 9 9 0 . This figure does not in\u00ad clude the public health and m edical care cost for an estim ated 24,000 ARC cases and at least 300,000 persons infected by the AIDS virus who show no sym ptom s in California. In the past four years the state has provided approxim ately $ 3 1 million for AIDS-related research. The governor's current b udget proposes an additional $ 9.5 m illion.An AIDS Prevention Trust will b e established to distribute the voluntary contributions to qualified AIDS research organizations. The trust will b e adm inistered by an independent body appointed by the legislature and the ad\u00ad m inistration for a specific term of three years with the specific purpose to coor\u00ad dinate and encourage cooperation am ong private (not-for-profit) and public sector AIDS research organiza\u00ad tions. \" To insure that taxpayers g et th e m ost for their donations, the trust will provide for scientists and researchers to set priorities and m ake certain there are no research gaps or duplication of ef\u00ad forts in order to win this war on AIDS,\" said Davis. The Franchise Tax Board estim ates the credit would provide from $ 6 1 million up to $ 200 million each year for three years, with a lesser amount being generated in the first year. The credit would go into effect tax year 1 9 8 7 . \" We don't need a crystal ball to identify the havoc AIDS will cause in the years to com e. We need im m ediate action to prevent a health and financial catastrophe confronting the people of this state,\" said Klehs. The credit would allow personal in\u00ad com e taxpayers a 5 5 percent credit up to a maximim of $ 2 5 single, $50 joint, and a 5 5 percent credit up to a max\u00ad imum of $5,000 for bank and corporate taxpayers for donations. It is assum ed that m ost of the bank and corporate tax contributions will be in addition to their current donations and will thus result in a substantial increase in overall cor\u00ad porate charitable giving. A B 563 is currently before the Assembly Revenue and Tax Commit\u00ad tee fo r hearings. Campaign to Support The Women's Building The move in 1978 to buy a deteriorating four-story facility in the Mission District was once called \" silly,\" and \" audacious.\" Leading figures in the city's business com\u00ad munity joked among themselves that a group of women would never have the know-how to buy, keep and maintain a building that would serve the needs of other women. Now, the dream of ownership draws near. 4 San Francisco Sentinel July 10, 1987 Sharon Johnson: Taking a Different Path to Empowerment by David M. Lowe Sharon Johnson has spent the last eight years of her life as the administrative assistant to Supervisor Harry Britt. Today she embarks on a new path of empowerment that puts her at political odds with a longtime friend and a major part of her support system.

She credits Harry Britt for her lo ng-term su ccess in staying with a job that has an unusually high burn-out rate at around two years. \" Harry has b een a terrific boss. He's understood m y problem s as a worker and single parent of five children and my need to be at hom e occasionally to balance out my life,\" said Johnson. \" He never insulted my work, hovered or corrected in a parental kind of way. He's been very respectful to m e as a worker and a hum an being.\" Johnson believes she shared a dream with Britt to em power the neighbor\u00ad hoods and other progressive idealists to take over City Hall. Sharing that dream and agreeing on virtually every m ajor issue of im portance also helped foster an incredible relationship betw een th e two. \" It m ade life easier to have a b o ss who view ed the world as you did and was supportive of you, who you are.\" Before com ing to City Hall, Johnson was the executive director of the San Francisco Dem ocratic Central Commit\u00ad tee where she m et Bill Kraus and taught him how to register voters and helped him set up a booth at the Gay Day Parade in 1 9 7 8 . She w ent to City Hall a little over a year later as a tem porary replacem ent for Andrea Jepson who took a leave of absence to work on Britt's cam paign to be elected Super\u00ad visor from the 5 th District.

To s ee them take their anger and op\u00ad pression and turn it into positive power.\" The community's rise to power has also changed City Hall. \" When Harry first cam e to office the hate mail w as atrocious and the phone calls w ere just awful. Now people have been educated both about Harry and the lesbian/gay com m unity so that they no lo n ger n eed to take the pot shots.\" Johnson characterized working at City Hall as bittersw eet. \"You've g ot your fingers on the pulse of life in San Francisco. Some days you g et to realize how really powerful you are. However, it's extrem ely painftil on those days w hen you realize you're not as pow erful as you think you are.

Then the very deep sad ness when you realize the sam e dynamics aren't going on in th e mayor's office. There w as the power of recognition and then the p ow erlessness of having to relinquish it with th e mayor's veto.\" On a daily basis Johnson adm its th e job requires a lot of patience to answ er the phone calls and deal with thenum erous problem s and com plaints voiced by constituents. \"Fortunately each call didn't chip away at my soul because w e used it as an opportunity to teach people how to u se the system . We didn't play nursem aid because w e wanted to give them the benefit of u sin g our know ledge to act on their own in th e future.\" There w ere som e phone calls that Johnson refused to take. \" I'm here to serve the public, but certainly not to b e abused. If som eone called up and said what's the faggot going to do about this, I was gone right then and there and gently hung up the phone.\" So why after eight years is Johnson leaving City Hall? \"It's tim e to leave City Hall now. 1 don't have anything m ore to give Harry or the com m unities at large on a City Hall level. It's a place that requires freshness and new ness every now and then.\" Johnson hopes to take her expertise on how to g et things done at City Halland help those who are intim idated by the process. The recipient of her talent will likely be a non-profit or city health agency concerned w ith the plight of th e hom eless, the AIDS crisis, wom en's health care issu es or black infant mor\u00ad tality rates in SF. However, betw een now and the end of the year Johnson will go to work as a full-tim e em ployee of the Agnos for Mayor cam paign. She exp resses a solem nness about her decision to part the political path with her longtim e friend and em ployer who is backing Supervisor John Molinari for the job. \" It's very difficult to tell som eone I really care about that 1 have a m ajor difference of opinion on supporting an issue or a candidate. My dream has always been that Harry and I w ould always view the world in sync. Unfor\u00ad tunately, in this instance w e don't. \"There is som e personal uncom fort - | ableness around our parting on th e i mayor's race, but we have a high regardis leaving CHy Hall after eight yean in and a great deal of resp ect for one another.\" Does Johnson think Britt has sold out the progressive agenda? \" No, I think Harry and I both want to em\u00ad power the progressive agenda but in this case w e have a different view on how that will happen.\" Johnson said leaving City Hall is not a tim e for celebration, but a period of solem n reflection. \" It's beginning to m ake m e cry. It's my life and all of these people around here are a part of it. On one level I feel very good know ing that I haven't fallen to the wayside to som e group decision. Som ething inside still sparks m e to say 'no, that's n ot right for m e and I can't go that route.' Loyalty is not blind. One m ust be loyal : to one's own seed s of growth.

Unlike many gay publications, including this one under previous ownership, the decision will not be simply, solely determined by the publisher. We have established an editorial board with nine equal members. They are: Robert Michael Golovich, Publisher Edward McMillian. Associate Publisher Tom Murray, Editor-in-Chief Rupert Kinnard, Art Director David M. Lowe, News Editor Eric Heilman, Arts Editor Corinne Lightweaver, Assistant News Editor Joel Lichtenwalter, Advertising Representative Bob Reed, Classifieds Advertising Representative We realize that no board can fully represent the diversity of viewpoints within our community. Nonetheless, we believe that the nine members reflect to a great degree the cross spec\u00ad trum of needs, hopes and dreams present today in San Fran\u00ad cisco's gay and lesbian community. The Process The editorial board will meet next week with three of the leading contenders in the 1987 mayoral race: Assemblyman Art Agnos, Supervisor John Molinari, and City Attorney Louise Renne. We believe that these three candidates have the best track records of support for issues concerning lesbian/gay people. We shall use the Alice B. Toklas Democratic Club Mayoral Questionnaire as the basis for questions and further discussion with each candidate.After these meetings there will be anonymous balloting. The candidate who receives the most votes will be endorsed by the Sentinel in this column. The Rationale Our publisher, Robert Michael Golovich, is personally supporting Supervisor John Molinari for mayor. Our news editor, David M. Lowe, is supporting Assemblyman Art Agnos. As editor-in-chief, I will remain neutral. My respon\u00ad sibility is to see that each candidate receives fair treatment during the race. The gay vote is crucial in 1987. As in the Congressional race earlier this year, feelings run deep about the issues, about who will represent us and shape legislation in the next several years. There has been bitter debate about Coining Up/'s en\u00ad dorsement of Nancy Pelosi for Congress and about how that decision was reached. Certainly it is the right and the respon\u00ad sibility of a newspaper to investigate candidates and inform the public of their conclusions. As advocacy publications representing a minority within San Francisco, Coming Up!, the Bay Area Reporter and theSFSentinel must educate and encourage people to vole wisely. We can't determine how our sister publications make their endorsements. We do intend, though, to set an example of public accountability and shared responsibility in our own process, and avoid the power trips and mud-slinging so prevalent in the past.

CA 94102 (415) 861-6100 LETTERS 'No' to the Navy To the Editor: Art Agnos is correct in taking John Molinari to task for supporting the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) betw een San Francisco and the US Navy which would allow discrimination against lesbians and gay m en applying for positions th e Missouri homeporting m ight provide potential job-seekers. However, in the narrow focus on the MOU and the few new jobs being created in San Francisco by homeporting this battleship, the m edia and Missouri hom eporting supporters ignore the fact that th e US Navy discrim inates against all lesbians and gay m en already, and excludes their participation in its organization. Despite the Navy's homophobia, many m ainstream , liberal politicians such as Supervisor Molinari continue to support homeporting, and by their actions will bring the Navy and its anti-gay policies to San Francisco. If people don't want an increase in homophobia in San Francisco, it won't be enough to insert a n ice- sounding \u2014 but unenforceable \u2014 declaration of non-discrim ination against gay people in the MOU. In\u00ad stead. people who are against homophobia m ust oppose the whole idea of hom eporting. and ''just say no\" to the Missouri, the US Navy, and their political agents. John Mehring Waiting for an Apology To the Editor: Your paper (6/26) included a letter signed by a dazzling array of prom\u00adinent w om en in our community. As m uch as these wom en deserve ad\u00ad miration. I believe their letter in sup\u00ad port of Coming Up! to be a m istake. The recent primary battle was a race betw een an experienced gay leader of great integrity versus a woman with lots of m oney. Though Pelosi is considered a liberal, sh e had never previously given support (financial or otherwise) to the LaRouchc counter-cam paign nor to AIDS causes. Obviously, there was no real choice for the lesbian and gay community. In fact, if Harry had won. I had hoped that Carol Migden or Pat Norman would be nam ed to replace him (a lesbian!). I wrote to som e of Cowing Up !'s advertisers asking them to discon\u00ad tinue their support of the paper. I in tend to continue to patronize these -p laces, and I did not threaten them . I feel that m y efforts were just in at\u00ad tem pting to m ake known the outrage so many of us felt at the paper's ab\u00ad surd endorsem ent. If Ihc Sentinel had acted in an ir\u00ad responsible manner, $hgw ing such a lack of respect for our gay leaders. I would have written the sam e letters, possibly with even greater anger. In fact. Coming Up! unfairly views th e argum ent that it is being attacked as one of sexism because it is a women's newspaper. Clearly, the response has nothing to do with sex\u00ad ism , for the issue was one of outrage at the shocking betrayal of our com\u00ad munity by one of its papers. Coming Up! was the real force seeking to divide our community. Thank you! to these wom en for their support of the men's communi\u00ad ty in these dire tim es. However. Coming Up! is no longer com ing home with m e until I hear of an S W PUycat of the Week: Meet Bacchus, a three-year-old female housecat who is shy at first, but slowly affectionate. Bacchus is one of many pets in the PAWS project that need loving, caring hom es.

(The following letter was sent to the B.A.R .Jh e Sentinel and Coming Up!) To the Editor: I am writing in response to the let\u00ad ter from Pam David et al., charging that leaders of the gay m ale com\u00ad munity have acquiesced to m isogynist attacks against Kim Cor- saro and Coming Up! in the after- m ath of that paper's endorsem ent of Nancy Pelosi for Congress. That let\u00adter was co-signed by people I per\u00ad sonally know and respect, so I am quite ready to believe the accusations m ade therein. I join its writers in condemning the actions of any m en who have stooped to w om en-hating attacks in their anger at Kim's deci\u00ad sion \u2014 and I urge the entire com\u00ad munity to bear-w itness, with their , voices and with their pocketbooks, that such behavior is totally unac\u00ad ceptable. This behavior, however, does not change the underlying issue. O f course, Kim Corsaro had the right to endorse whom ever she pleased. She also had the right to publish her m isgivings about Harry Britt. In\u00ad deed, if Kim had endorsed Carol Ruth Silver, Doris W^rd, or anyother even vaguely progressive can\u00ad didate, male or female, I would respect that endorsem ent as an honest difference of opinion about Harry Britt's suitability for the job. But she did not. Unless she can come up with a credible explanation of why sh e betrayed her own paper's progressive politics to endorse a candidate as questionable as Ms. Pelosi, I can on\u00ad ly believe that Ms. Corsaro sold out our community to the Burton m achine. Until then, I will continue to boycott Coming Up! I urge my gay and lesbian brothers and sisters to do likew ise.

The majority of those calls were readers questioning his ability to wholesale deliver this newspaper to the Molinari campaign. One of the callers asked, \" What's wrong, Golovich? Can't control your writers over there at tbt Sentinel?\" \" Excuse me,\" responded Golovich. \" I believe you've dialed the wrong number. You've reached Bob Golovich, not Bob Ross!\" Thus began a w eek of political maneuvering that resulted in the Alice B. Toklas Lesbian/Gay Dem ocratic Gub rejecting all m easures to safeguard the integrity of next Monday's ent resigning protest. AbuM of Power Last Monday the executive commit\u00ad tee of the Toklas Gub rejected a num ber of proposals by the Agnos cam paign to ensure the upcom ing mayoral endorsem ent vote is credible. Under the proposal adopted, club m em bers will not be required to show any identification to obtain a ballot.Gub m em bers will not be required to sign a m em bership roll upon obtaining the ballot. Even a proposal to stam p m em bers' hands to insure once-only voting was rejected. Com m ittee m em \u00ad ber and Molinari supporter Richmond Young told the Sentinel the su g gested requirem ents have never before been in\u00ad stituted and were unworkable. Agnos backers on the executive com\u00ad m ittee felt the safeguards w ere necessary to insure a fair, credible endorsem ent. I contend that the executive com m ittee should require I.D. and at the very least stam p hands to protect the integrity of the endorsem ent process. The executive com m ittee's rulingsDAVE) M LOWE cannot be challenged at Monday's en\u00ad dorsem ent m eeting because the voting will begin V/i hours prior to th e m eeting being called to order. If you're a Molinari supporter, but believe voting safeguards should b e adopted, your only choice is to vote NO ENDORSEMENT and dem and the ex\u00ad ecutive com m ittee adopt credible voting guidelines for the August m eeting. The integrity of the state's largest Demo\u00ad cratic club is at stake here. It's your club! Co-Chair Resigns Toklas executive com m ittee m em ber Mike Denton resigned his position as Duboce Triangle co-chair of the Molinari cam paign Monday. D enton told the Sentinel he resigned because of the m ethods being used by Molinari backers to obtain the Toklas endorse\u00ad m ent. \" I've never b een involved in such an underhanded campaign,\" said Den\u00ad ton. \" They abused their power to change the rules. It's m ore im portant to m e to protect the credibility of the club and preserve the sanctity of the election than to ensure Molinari is endorsed at any cost.\" Denton will now devote his energies to the District Election cam paign and reevaluate his choice for mayor. \"I will not be voting for Molinari,\" contends Denton. I'm truly sorry that I can't give you the explicit details of what occurred atthe executive com m ittee m eeting, but I was told by Molinari operative Dennis Collins and club president Roberto Esteves that if I attended there w ould probably be a m ove to close the m eeting to the p ress. However, we will be at the Women's Building on Monday for the Toklas en\u00ad dorsem ent m eeting. At this point insiders in both the Agnos and Molinari cam ps predict the endorsem ent of Molinari depends on as few as three votes and as m any as 1 5 . This is one showdown you won't want to m iss. Voting will start at 5 pm with the m eeting gaveled to order at 7:30 pm . See you there.

Friday's Folly Last w eek m y colleague Wayne Fri\u00ad day over at the Bay Area Reporter wrote a new s analysis that should have clearly been labeled com m entary. The headline referred to Agnos critics but never quoted one. Just for the record, here is what the assem blym an actually said at the mayoral debate in resp onse C o n tin u e d o n p s g * 9 AT THE COURTHOUSE _______________________________ KEN CADY Ed Meese and Louise Renne One of the lower moments of my professional career was watching several hundred California prosecuting attorneys give Attorney General Edwin Meese a standing ovation at their summer convention in San Diego last year. This man is the target of four separate probes by federal investigators and has publicly stated his disregard for constitutional rights. Meese is alleged to have called the Army in 1982, when he was a top aide to President Reagan, and asked them to give a $32 million contract to Wedtech Corp., a company with ties to his personal lawyer. Wedtech got the job. Furthermore, he's be\u00ad ing investigated for the delay he gave Ollie North before an\u00ad nouncing the Iran-Contra deals. M eese is alleged to have kept the FBI out of the early stages of the investiga\u00ad tion. M eese also is accused of sidetrack\u00ad ing FBI inquiries into Southern Air Transport, a form er CIA front com\u00ad pany. The fourth inquiry, being con\u00ad ducted by the House Judiciary sub\u00ad com m ittee on crime, questions wheth\u00ad er Meese committed petjury when hetestified about an effort by drug agents under his control to win release of ^ American hostages in Beirut. All of this com es after M eese's con\u00ad troversial confirmation hearings in 1 9 8 4 w here his judgm ent and honesty w ere questioned. An independent counsel had investigated allegations that M eese helped his friends get federal jobs afterthey gave him financial assistance. He's the only public official ever investigated by two independent counsels. So when DAs applaud him, it causes m e to question my own role. I resigned from the California District Attorneys Association, as did m y colleague Chuck Haines. The group is now run by th e District Attorney from Orange County. Its new executive director is a form er aide to State Senator Ed Davis. And w hen M eese lauds Washington. DC police officers for wearing yellow gloves to deal with gay and lesbian pro\u00ad testers, I can only hope that the prison officials who ultimately deal with him wear gloves as w ell. It's frustrating to see such a m an lead lawyers involved in law enforcem ent, because m ost prosecutors care m uch m ore for the law and for civil rights than Ed M eese. In San Francisco, District Attorney Arlo Smith is the first DA to hire assistants who are openly gay. He is a m em ber of gay groups and fre\u00ad quently socializes with his gay friends. Even though he is up for re-election this year, he didn't worry about the folks in the Sunset, he immediately and vigorously supported the bid of Super\u00ad visor Harry Britt for a seat in Congress. City Attorney Louise Renne was ex\u00adpected to bring a new look to that office w hen she replaced the late George Agnost. Renne portrayed herself as a friend of the gay community when sh e w as a supervisor and was believed to be m uch m ore conscious of our problem s than her predecessor. Yet she has been such a disappointm ent in that office that it is a wonder that anybody can take her mayoral bid seriously. When the office needed som eone to take charge and upgrade m orale, Louise an\u00ad nounced that she wanted to leave, angering her friend who had appointed her to give stability and leadership to the office. Now she pretends that her lop assistants can impartially give ad\u00ad vice to other m ayoral candidates. And her actions on cases involving gays have been atrocious and deceptive. She followed Agnost's plans to u se private spies in the bathhouses. She went further than Agnost in trying to propagate and legalize anti-gay dis\u00ad crimination. Even after she told the gay p ress that she supported the ordinance protecting us from discrim ination, sh e still pursued the issue. She lost in the lower court, she lost in the Court of Ap\u00ad peal, and then she still tried to g et th e trial judge to honor a retired judge's opinion that this ordinance was un\u00ad constitutional. Another case involving her office which should not go unnoticed is Coon v . Joseph, where the Court of Appeal ruled that a long-term gay lover was not in a relationship that qualified him to Isu e for infliction of em otional distress. If a wife sees her husband, for exam ple, injured, and suffers em otional d istress, the courts have ruled that the relation\u00ad ship is close enough that the person causing the injury should com pensate for the d istress caused the wife. Parent- child relationships have also qualified, as have com m on-law heterosexual mar\u00ad riages. But the San Francisco City Attorney's office doesn't think gay rela\u00ad tionships have that kind of value. So w hen w e look at law enforcem ent officials, we can write off Ed M eese. Every gay person who voted for th e Reagan administration should b e hiding his/her face. We can only hope to survive this presidency and do better next tim e. But in San Francisco, w e expect m ore of our elected officials. Law en\u00ad forcem ent m ust be com passionate and relate to the whole community. Gay and lesbian citizens are not asking for special privileges, just the sam e p rivileges. When Louise Renne, candidate for m ayor, can suddenly see racism at th e Olympic Club were her husband, a m em ber, has never sponsored a black applicant, or a gay one for all that I know, I would hope that she will start to understand her official role as pro\u00ad tector of the entire community. If sh e can't do that with conviction and sincerity, then I join the mayor in sug\u00ad gesting that she resign.

PIC K IN G TWO O F * San Francisco Sentinel July 10, 1987 7c POINT OF VIEW LINMAZLO Spiritual Revelation, Medical Revolution, a Plague of Politics AIDS Hospice \u2014 An Attendant's Tale My life as a home care worker with people with A ID S began in August 1985. Since then I have cared for all kinds of people \u2014 gay men, a heterosexual man who contracted AID S through a blood transfusion, people of color, substance abusers and people with severe dementia. Working with AIDS \u2014 including people with AIDS, their friends, lovers and fam ilies, friends with AIDS. AIDS organizations, m y friends and fam ily, and the public at large \u2014 has dramatically changed m y life. It has rearranged my schedule, brought m e close to many people, disturbed m y sleep, opened m e to grief and com pas\u00ad sion, led m e into a new career (nursing), and put m e on the front lines of one of the m ost m isunderstood and m is\u00ad m anaged catastrophes of all tim e. At the tim e I began working as an at\u00ad tendant in the East Bay, extensive ser\u00ad vices such as those in SF were not yet in place. The AIDS population w as far different than in the West Bay. with le s s white gay m en and m ore substance abusers and people of color. In m y previous work as an em otional support volunteer at the East Bay AIDS Pro\u00ad ject, I found m yself involved in people's affairs far beyond m y supposed respon\u00ad sibilities, including personal care. The older straight m an who'd gotten the transfusion had an incredibly hom o- phobic son living with him, but help was hard to com e by. In short, people need a lot of help in struggling w ith AIDS, at all stages of the process. In February of 1986,1 began work\u00ad ing for Hospice of SF, com m uting until I m oved back to the city in July. While working in people's hom es and at the Shanti resid ences providing 24-hour Hospice care. I've helped many people through their dying processes. I've becom e intim ately involved with them , their loved ones, and the very heart of AIDS.AIDS is a revolutionary d isease. It is forcing us to take responsibility for our lives and the choices we m ake. It is challenging the foundations of Western m edical practice and threatening to col- . lapse hopelessley inadequate public and hom e health care system s. It has clearly exposed the unresponsiveness of the Reagan Administration. While AIDS is clearly not the govern\u00ad m ent's num ber one health priority, it is for m any of us. We can no longer g e t sick, go to a doctor, g et a pill or shot, and be cured. We have had to painfully learn that what w e put into our bodies m atters. I have seen people m ake com\u00ad plete and radical changes in lifestyle, both in term s of physical habits and spiritual breakthroughs. Surely AIDS has a spiritual dim ension. It has th e pow er to alter people's perceptions of them selves and of life and death. In this context, entering AIDS work w as som ewhat natural for m e. I'm a bom helper. And yet, I have the detach\u00ad m ent that Hospice work dem ands. Once I got over m y stuff about body functions and fluids, and trained as a Home Health Aide, I was ready. It is a strange \u2014 if challenging and rewarding \u2014 job all the sam e. The goal is to help som eone die com fortably. If they do, you've done a good job. But then there is the sadness, the grief, the loss \u2014 and then on to the next dying person w ith AIDS. Everyone dies differently, each in his or her own way. My experience has been than people tend to die the way they lived. After asking m yself why I was drawn into home care for people with AIDS W a n t to talk a b o u t it?

I realized it is because of a basic belief I hold that people ought to be able to die at hom e if they choose. Many people don't know it is an op\u00ad tion. At the turn of the century. 80% of deaths occurred at hom e and 20% in institutions. Now the figures are just about reversed. For som eone with AIDS to be at hom e, it requires som e\u00ad one like m e to care for them . It also takes nurses, social workers, support system s and a lot of honesty and courage. My belief in the right to die at hom e has nothing to do directly with AIDS. I've believed this fora long tim e. AIDS cam e along and pushed m e to act. Although a lot of us have had people in our lives die of AIDS, many people don't know what this dying can look like. Given the range of possible infec\u00ad tions, including HIV active in the brain, people can present m any unusual and disconcerting sym ptom s. The ravages of dem entia, PML, MIA and toxoplasm osis leave, many unable to think clearly or express their needs.som e of us may g et health benefits with the new contract that begins in July, w e were allowed no discussion or input, after m aking the dem and a year ago. In the words of a statem ent prepared by an attendant Task Force set up to address som e of the problem s: Attendants working in the AIDS HOME CARE & HOSPICE PROGRAM, because of their lim ited wages, are unable to afford the m onthly insurance prem ium . And yet. they work for an organ\u00ad ization whose primary m ission is the provision of health care ser\u00ad vices. Many in fact, are at risk for the life-threatening illness they wit\u00ad n ess profoundly affecting their clients. The irony of being unin\u00ad sured for health care.. .questions Hospice's intrinsic values which are the foundation of the Hospice Philosophy. Hospice is an organization that has gone through m ore changes than the flower beds in Golden Gate Park. After Medi-Cal refused to honor substantial claim s through reim bursem ent, th e traditional Hospice for non-AIDS ter\u00ad minally ill people was shut down in February 1 9 8 6 . The AIDS Home Care Hospice of SF is an organization that has gone through more changes than the flower beds in Golden Gate P ark. Studies indicate that 60% of people with AIDS will experience dem entia as a sym ptom during their illness, and autopsies reveal neurological impair\u00ad m ent in 90% of the cases. Wasting syn\u00ad drom e and lesions can drastically dis\u00ad figure a person. There is a continual loss of body functions and control. Som etim es limit setting is a necessary part of intervention. People can becom e abusive and com bative or passive and' semkomatose. Many of us are un\u00ad prepared to deal with the rapid deterioration that precedes death. Ter\u00ad m inal illness teaches u s to be com fort\u00ad able in uncom fortable situations. Often, people with AIDS are unable to resolve som e of their personal or spiritual conflicts before they are too sick. There is the unspoken problem of friends, lovers, and family taking cruel and unfair advantage of their posses\u00ad sions and assets. Due to dem entia and disability, the work of approaching ac\u00ad ceptance and finishing b u siness is given over to physical m aintenance and sym ptom m anagem ent, including pain control. While AIDS work d oes have its rew ards and satisfactions, the job of Hospice attendant is fraught with dif\u00ad ficulties. Some of these lie in the nature of the work; others are the m anifesta\u00ad tions of politics and indifferent m anage\u00ad m ent. I'd like to say that working for Hospice is a nurturing, supportive ex\u00ad perience. That's what I'd like to say \u2014 would that it w ere so. Irregular and constantly changing hours, lack of con\u00ad sistent care standards, understaffing, low pay ($6.56/hr.), and lack of any health b enefits m ake em ploym ent at Hospice a real challenge. Althoughand Hospice Program was established largely with city funding in 1 9 8 3 . Hospice receives about 65% of its in\u00ad com e from this Departm ent of Public Health award. Hospice has now re\u00ad opened its traditional Hospice pro\u00ad gram. developed the first Hospice residence primarily devoted to people with AIDS (Coming Home), and been acquired along with the entire Visiting Nurses Association by m edical giant Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center (PPMC). However, the problem s that plagued the AIDS Program since its in\u00ad ception are still there. Hospice has generally b een under\u00ad staffed since before its caseload w ent from 44 to 63 in July of 1 9 8 6 . As m any as 40 outside registry attendants have been used on weekends, costing up to twice as m uch as regular attendants and bringing in people who are often un\u00ad equipped and untrained to deal with the problem s of people with AIDS-like dem entia. The caseload will rise to 7 3 this July. As attendants, w e are isolated in th e hom e with little or no team coordina\u00ad tion or regularity (in contrast to th e basic Hospice approach of team partic\u00ad ipation and conferences). In-services are rare or non-existent, and there are insufficient m echanism s for support or problem -solving. Monthly attendant m eetings (none the first four m onths of this year after the PPMC takeover) are poorly attended, with 0 - 5 people out of 1 0 0 or m ore attending. Attem pts at discussions with the m anagem ent (first Hospice and now PPMC) have pro\u00ad duced few results and a great m any frustrations. My purpose is not to undercut th evital role or im portance of Hospice in m eeting the need s of people with AIDS, but as an organization, it is unable to advocate or lobby for increased sup\u00ad port. Home care for terminally ill peo\u00ad ple is undeniably cost-effective com\u00ad pared to hospital care, and necessary given the dire need of beds for people in treatm ent or acute stag es. In this light, it is unconscionable that the two 24-hour care Shanti/Hospicc residences (5 beds each) were not main\u00ad tained after Coming Home Hospice opened, especially considering there is a hom eless AIDS population estim ated to be in the 5 0 - 2 0 0 range. The city's plan to place people in private facilities will not only cost m ore, but lower the stan\u00ad dard of care that people received in the houses. One house was specifically for people with neurological im pairm ent. Unbelievably, there was no outcry or attem pt to sustain these unique living situations which were running well after two years of trial and error. The transi\u00ad tion of focus to Coming Home has not been easy. The needs of donors w ere catered to m ore than the needs of the residents. Conditions for attendants were less than satisfactory until a mini\u00ad revolt opened eyes and ears and forced changes. Com plaints of non-paym ent for over\u00ad tim e (with som e attendants working 60 hours or m ore a w eek to m ake a living) filed with the Federal Wage and Hour Board and the State Labor Com m ission have resulted in an audit of Hospice's records for the past two years. There is a definition by which home care workers can be exem pt from overtim e laws if they are classified as ''compa\u00ad nion'' (federal) or ''personal attendant\" (state). It is m y contention that a new non\u00ad exem pt category of \" Hospice Attend\u00ad ant'' needs to be created, or people learn m ore about what it takes to m anage a terminally ill person at hom e. We m ust diligently monitor and assess a person's condition and be well trained to handle dem entia and other com plex facets of AIDS. The practical aspects aside; w e often deal with the intense em otional needs of loved ones. Attendants are given great respon\u00ad sibilities and m uch lip service is paid to how we are the backbone of the organ\u00ad ization. How can we rem ain without health benefits? Why is there so little support and so m uch burn-out? There is im m ense pressure to say \"yes\" w hen asked to work, regardless of how m any hours you've already put in. After th e m erger with PPMC, the voice that had been raised was lost in the shuffle of new offices, new staff, and new manage\u00ad m ent. While the b osses and adm inistrators live in an ideal movie version of Hospice, real people like m e are trying to figure out how to live our commit\u00ad m ent to people with AIDS and take care of ourselves on low w ages and no health benefits. Real people are dying and in need of som eone to feed them , hold their hand, and g et them ready for sleep. Lin Mazlo is a weaver/artist and Home Health A ide.

Mural C o n tin u e d fro m p a g e 1 Poethig. \"A Harvey Milk m em orial on the Harvey Milk Rec Center overlook\u00ad ing the park on a building that need s som e beautification. I don't understand why they've rejected it.\" Her chosen site, the east-facing w all of the Harvey Milk Recreation and Cultural Center at the comer of Duboce and Scott Streets, may stir the im agina\u00ad tion of a m uralist, but offers little in\u00ad spiration for the rest of us. At-the top of a grass-covered hill, the wall looks like, and is about the sam e size as, the screen at a drive-in m ovie theatre. Like the re st of the building, Poethig's proposed canvas is painted an industrial g ray- brown. Poethig's neighbor, a gay m an who has AIDS, first su g gested the possibility of a Milk m em orial. She had already com pleted several m urals in the city, the latest a tribute to the Philippino upris\u00ad ing on a building on Alemany Boule\u00ad vard. Com pleted several m onths ago, it com bines surreal elem ents with graphic realism : m archers pour out of a shat\u00ad tered bust of Ferdinand Marcos, w hile Corizon Aquino cradles her slain hus\u00ad band's head in her arm s. The Milk m ural is lighter-hearted. A scene from The Times o f Harvey Milk, the Academy Award-winning docu\u00ad m entary about the gay com m unity leader's election to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and his assassina\u00ad tion by Dan White in 1 978, form s th e centerpiece of her design. Against a backdrop of a giant flower, Milk ap\u00ad pears as he did in the Lesbian/Gay Freedom Day Parade, waving w ith both arms, a floral lei around his neck: \"I loved that im age of him , just th e joy and the victory of it,\" says Poethig. \" Then I talked with a lot of p eople around him, and they said he was a down, and they would like to s ee that.\" So sh e added the clown that seem s to be carrying Milk on his shoulders. Scott Smith of the Harvey Milk Archives sug\u00ad g ested including Milk's beloved dog, who looks on from the lower right cor\u00ad ner. A pair of dancers su g g est the center's cultural activities. \" i could have gone another route,\" sh e says. \" Maybe I could have done som ething really heavy-duty historical. But I just didn't think that would be ap\u00ad propriate in a park setting. My im pres\u00ad sion that I got from people is that this isthe way they would like to see Harvey, and this is the way his personality was, a free spirit.\" Some neighbors in the Duboce Tri\u00ad angle area, including Deputy Mayor Rotea Gilford, didn't feel that any mural was appropriate in the park set\u00ad ting. When Poethig first presented her idea to Rec and Park, a group of neigh\u00ad bors showed up to protest. When the proposal cam e up for a com m ittee vote last w eek, two com m issioners voted against the project altogether; the third com m ittee m em ber voted in favor of a com prom ise site \u2014 a wall facing Duboce Street, where the Milk m ural would provide a backdrop for basket\u00ad ball courts. One of the com m issioners citedm aintenance costs as a reason for op\u00ad posing the mural. Poethig says it is th e first tim e that objection has b een u sed to oppose a m ural in the city, and fears it could se t a dangerous precedent. \"At this point in San Francisco there are m urals that are ten, fifteen, tw enty years old that are going to need to b e m aintained, and on a case-b y-case basis they are being redone,\" she says. \"That wall has to be painted every few years anyway, and painters g et paid about ten tim es as m uch as m uralists. In the long run, m urals are very co st- effective.\" The m ural could even have another benefit: deterring graffiti. Poethig says graffiti writers seem to respect the work of m uralists, and points to her work at the comer of 22nd and Bryant, which has escaped vandalism since it w ent up in 1 9 8 3 , while surrounding lightpoles, walls and windows continue to sprout spray-painted \"tags.\" \"The m ost it's ever gotten is they p u t a cigarette in the little girl's m outh, so I just sort of painted it out,\" sh e says. \" It's going to happen som etim es, b u t m uralists go out and fix it. You care about your m ural so you go and fix it. Nobody's paying you. but you care about your work, so you go do it.\" The full Rec and Park Com m ission is slated to vote on the Milk m ural at its I next m eeting, on Thursday. July 1 6 . at 2 pm in McLaren Lodge at the comer of Fell and Stanyan Streets. \" I have so m any letters and signa\u00ad tures, but they just don't seem to count, com pared to people just showing up at the m eeting and speaking out for m urals and this m em orial to Harvey Milk,\" sh e says. Funding isn't a problem , because Poethig already has $ 7,000 in grant money to finance the painting of the m ural \u2014 not a lot of extra cash, con\u00ad sidering the high costs of scaffolding, in\u00ad surance, and hiring an assistant, sh e says, but enough to com plete the m ural. Her m ind is already racing ahead to an even m ore am bitious undertaking, one that she feels would be even harder to push through the bureaucracy of ap\u00ad proval p rocesses. \" I'd like to do a m ural about th e Gay Freedom Day Parade. I'd like to s ee a wall with the variety of people in our com m unity. Try to g et that onethrough,\" she chuckles. But for now, the Milk m ural is taking m ost of her efforts. Even the wall over the basketball court would be accept\u00ad able. FROM THE DESK C o n tin u e d fro m p a g e 7 to charges he attacked Molinari for do\u00ad ing a benefit at a leather bar.

Possible Benefits People who get test results usually reduce high risk behavior By taking the test, you find out whether or not you can infect others. Regardless of the result, testing often increases a person's commitment to overall good health habits. People who test negative feel less anxious after testing.

When the AIDS Budget Task Force, chaired by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose) m et in May, Martin reports, it decided that an increase in funds for research was not necessary.

Norman Leaf Debating Spiritualism To the Editor: I don't want to start an ongoing feud, but I feel 1 m ust respond to D. Scott Gibb's letter, printed in the 7 /3 issue of the Sentinel, in response to my own epistle in the June 1 9 th issue. In my letter, I had decried the new spiritualism endorsed by many gays in the shadow of AIDS. Mr. Gibb describes this new spiritualism as \" a revitalization of the ancient belief that the hum an soul is an im mortal bundle of energy that returns to Earth in hum an form through a series of life\u00ad tim es in order to learn lessons necessary to go on to the next stage.\"What is he talking about? Whose \"ancient belief' is this? Who does Mr. Gibb presum e to be speaking for? Souls, bundles of energy, and rein\u00ad carnation aside, Mr. Gibb proceeds to identify yours truly as som eone who \"evidently has a low level of under\u00ad standing in these m atters.\" Frankly, I deplore the tone of condescension and his plain arrogance. Where spirituality is concerned, I don't believe there is such a thing as lower of higher under\u00ad standing. In any event, w hen I had described current spiritualist trends as \" patently and proudly m indless,\" I didn't foresee objections by those who m ight affirm such beliefs. To say that this spiritualism is anti-intellectual (what I m eant by \" m indless\") is not bigotry on my part \u2014 it's a viable response to many of these practi\u00ad tioners (particularly Julian Baird, whose commentary had prom pted m y own indignation). Finally, Mr. Gibb may be correct when he states that the tragedy of m y friend's death was \" m agnified\" by h is anger and disgust at death's door. Yes, the tragedy was m agnified, but why shouldn't it be? Why should any of us shy away from the deeply tragic dim ensions of this epidemic? John J .

One m an w as seen laughing, with the majority of th e folks there. The other waited a few m om ents, then got up and left because he was hurt and felt ridiculed and angry at the insensitivity shown him. Part of the insensitivity was to assum e that he was not there, that it was okay even if he were, and that he would stay invisible. ' ' Incensed, Ken Jones chose the op\u00ad posite and together with Norman assem bled a network of volunteers, my\u00ad self included, who com piled existing literature on the experiences of black hom osexuals and prepared presenta\u00ad tions on several key topics \u2014 from the lost heritage of black hom osexuals in African-American history and the kin\u00ad ship betw een \" Negrophobia\" and homophobia, to the destructive conse\u00ad quences of living in closets for the entire black community, and the continuing failure of the black church to provide positive guidance about hum an sexuali\u00ad ty - The forum , sponsored by Assem bly Speaker Willie Brown Jr., drew an au\u00ad dience of thirty-three invited communi\u00adty leaders representing the m edia, the black church, the San Francisco school board, the Black Caucus of the Califor\u00ad nia Democratic Party, the Bay Area Urban League, and diverse black ac\u00ad tivist groups. The event, in a word, w as enlightening \u2014 the tone of the day even-tem pered but frank. \" My choice to be a lesbian at age 4 5 puts m e on the outside,\" said panelist Virginia Harris. \" By law and violence black people have lost som ething very basic to our existence. We have been at\u00ad tacked at all levels of humanity. We in turn attack others who don't fit th e definitions im posed by those who took our humanity in the first place. We rigidly accept narrow definitions of who we are. We deny humanity to those who are different. We deny devastation of our youth through drugs, lack of educa\u00ad tion, jobs. hope. We refuse tb acknow\u00ad ledge the disaster of the AIDS epidem ic in our community and tum our hostility on those of us who dare to speak.

Perhaps he just m eans \"people\" of the m ale gender. It is im portant to recognize that aspects of homophobia exist even in the gay community. It seem s contra\u00ad dictory to assert that one is openly gay and then restrict the rights of others by defining \" param eters of ap\u00ad propriate appearance.\" When you com e out of the closet bring your clothes with you. Uniforms are only for play, not work. Kvia A. Perkins Spiritualizing AIDS To the Editor: This is my first time reading the Sentinel and I appreciate its profes\u00adsional layout. I was especially in\u00ad terested in the interview with Julian Baird (6/12) and wish to share m y reactions to it. Mr. Baird's em phasis on the need to not fear AIDS is im portant because fear is really a w aste of our energy. I have to agree that th e m edia are getting a good deal of m ileage out of this challenge. I think this constant em phasis on th e negative does frighten people and probably som e people are leaving San Francisco as a result. But I wish to report that I am one of those peo\u00ad ple who feels drawn to the city at ; this tim e because I feel deeper in\u00ad volvem ent with people with AIDS is a necessary part of spiritual growth. I do not expect this to be easy, but I feel drawn to this problem out of a sense of gratitude for my own health and life. There are a num ber of things Mr. Baird said in the interview I disagree with. Mr. Baird's initial response to the question about fluid exchange, I find irresponsible. He exhibits a tendency, common am ong New Age people, to spiritualize everything, in\u00ad cluding the notion one can dissolve the AIDS virus with spiritual thoughts. I agree that a spiritually evolved person is likely to have astronger immune system , but this is highly speculative. To follow his logic, the blood of a spiritual m aster is significantly different from that of the average person on the street. Enough so that it would not provide a suitable environment for the virus. Unless there is scientific evidence to prove it, this is pure bull. This think\u00ad ing is a throwback to the Dark Ages when scientific fact was rejected in the nam e of a superior religious system . It is not only dangerous thinking, but a refusal to accept the truth about the natural order. I am surprised that since Mr. Baird talked about \"going beyond fluid exchange.\" he did not talk about \"going beyond sex.\" After all. many highly evolved spiritual people report the lack of interest in genital sex. They express their love in a m uch m ore universal way. Spiritual m asters not only don't need condom s, they don't need sex. I know the idea of life without genital sex is repugnant to a large number of gay m en. A whole economy has grown up to m eet th ese needs. I do not believe a celibate life is desirable or workable, but perhaps for a few unique individuals. At th e sam e time, we should recognize that a significant num ber of gay m en are place in a Burien living room that would have anything to do with gay m en and wom en in skim py sw im suits? Ah, the board m eeting of the organiza\u00ad tion which sanctions Masters Swim\u00ad m ing m eets, thereby covering the m eet with the all-im portant liability in\u00ad surance. Well...when you start talking Burien you are talking hardcore Middle America (you don't have to travel too far inland before you hit the w aste\u00ad lands). \"Sanctioning this event will destroy M asters Swim ming in Washing\u00ad ton.\" \" What if som e similar group like the KKK wanted us to sanction a meet?\" \"You know, the real issue here is AIDS.\" I g u ess that m akes sen se. After all, their daughters g et prepant from swim m ing pools. But to m ake a long story short. Truth, Justice and the Un-American Way prevailed. Swimming and waterwonder, is that coincidence or cause and effect? In the service of scientific curiosity, several colleagues and I self\u00ad lessly devoted ourselves to speaking to as many cute athletes as possible, \"querying\" them as to what sport they played and whence they hailed. The first few dozen inquiries turned up a disproportionately large num ber of California volleyball players, but as the num ber of cuties w e approached, er, in\u00ad terview ed reached the several hunded mark, w e found hot m en and wom en in every sport and from every geograph\u00ad ical location \u2014 New York, Washington, DC, Texas, Canada, Arizona, etc. All told, over 900 sexy gay and lesbian athletes convened in Seattle over the Fourth of July weekend. When you add the fact that the USS Nimitz with its 3 6 0 0 sailors was in port, well, the fire\u00ad works weren't just in the sky! A final note: holding the Festival on Seattle Hosts Gay Sports Festivalword. You see, finding a site proved to be difficult. On the big day our intrepid band of com petitors \u2014 two wom en and three m en \u2014 infiltrated an unsuspecting gym and right there, in the m idst of th e absurdly oblivious patrons, held their com petition. The 1 0 9 swim m ers, six divers and 3 5 j water polo players also encountered I problem s with their site. What p rob- ! iem s? Try gang warfare, im ported from j Los Angeles (can't they just stick to I m aking m ovies?)! It seem s that rival gangs had been holding a com petition I of their own, which included su ch j gam es as pedestrian assaults and ! m achine-gun strafing. A w eek before ! the Festival, Seattle's Sunday paper featured a front-page photo of the m ost violent gang standing atop their bunker, i which was the very pool planned for u se j by the Festival! Suddenly, visions not of j sugar-plum s and speedo-clad boys but Spectators at the Seattle Sports Festival. by Jason, Jeremy and Joshua Bolt LETTERS C o n tin u e d fro m p reviou s p a g e Judging Shirley To the Editor: I would like to com m ent on th e references to Shirley MacLaine in Dave Ford's article about the \"AID & COMFORT\" benefit (6/12). I happen to be one of the people with whom Shirley sat. We talked about the negative effects both the gay and non-gay m edia has upon people who are trying to heal, by perpetuating the idea that there is no hope. I found her to be com passionate, sincere and never did I com e in con\u00ad tact with Shirley MacLaine the ac\u00ad tress. I felt rather assaulted when I read Dave Ford's rather judgmental ac\u00ad count of Shirley's speech. She talked about the peace that passeth all understanding. Perhaps Mr. Ford has not seen enough death to over\u00ad com e the fear of people like Shirley and m yself. He should, however, understand from his own experience as a gay man that he doesn't need to ridicule people he doesn't under\u00ad stand. As the fear of dealing with their own sexuality is the motivating force behind homophobic persons, sotoo is the fear of death the motiva\u00ad tion behind those who ridicule m eta- p hysifsr- I am glad that Shirley had th e courage to stand up and say that the m ost important thing of all is that people are going to live with AIDS instead of die with AIDS. We need to say it over and over again, until w e believe it so m uch that it becom es true. It is tim e to becom e alive again! We have, in our grief, lost touch with that wonderful gay spirit that fed us all through the last decade. We seem to have forgotten, in our preoccupation with death* that we are m agical people. Wecfo have the ability to heal ourselves. We are and always have been th e teachers, the mystics, the healers and the lovers. As I have stood in the past, arm in arm with my lover, to defy that judgmental world which says we are queer and sinners because of who w e love, I now stand proud with m y ideas that the sam e love can heal the earth. I can truly say that I have touched that great truth which death has to teach us and I am trans\u00ad form ed. If that causes others to think I am crazy, then so be it! Robert Starkey The Poppy ProjectPerhaps for Bobby Sherman the bluest skies you ve ever seen were in Seattle, but for the gay and lesbian athletes last weekend, Seattle showed only gray skies. Of course it mat\u00ad tered little, as all eyes were starry over the lumberjacks and lumberjills! After participating in Gay Games II, Team Seattle (very original name) could barely keep their libidos in check until Gay Games III in 1 9 9 0 , so they decided to host a sporting event of their own: The Northwest Gay/Lesbian Sports Festival. And we are talking festival. On a green lawn bedecked with pavilions, tastefully colored with ivory and m ustard stripes, dozens of w hite-cladcroquet players took m allets in hand j and played ball. The com petition was j intense, but then so w as the catering, j Low blood sugar? Please, do help your- | self to a bagel with cream cheese and lox j or a m orsel of dilettante chocolates. And really, nothing steels shaky nerves like a glass of Chardonnay or cham - ! pagne.... Powerlifting w as a tad less con- I spicuous. Incognito m ight be a better 1of arm ed guards and the Munich Olym- j pics danced through Festival Director j Rick Peterson's head. The m eet w as j m oved, and the gangs stayed off our | new turf. Actually, gang warfare was only the ; last hurdle Peterson and his indefatig- j able staff faced in hosting the swim j m eet. Several m onths earlier, he had | walked into a m odem day lion's den \u2014 the living room of a cookie-cutter condo in Burien. Wait, in where? In Burien, j one of those all-too-picturesque sub\u00ad urbs which support the \" Nookleeyur\" Family. But what could possibly take 1polo (but how do you saddle a sea\u00ad horse?) w ere huge successes. No doubt you'll burst with pride to know that our very own San Francisco Tsunam i Swim Team performed with awesome strength and dazzling elan. Everyone turned in spectacular tim es \u2014 in m any cases even better than what they ac\u00ad com plished at Gay Games II! And our Tsunam i Homo Polo team beat San Diego 9 to 7 to win the historic/? / ever gay/lesbian water polo gam e! Success stories abounded. Tennis had 72 players, m ostly from California. Mostly cute, too. Which m ade m ej Independence Day w eekend turned out i to have profound significance. Ten days ! earlier, the Supreme Court had ruled { that Gay Games could not call itself | Gay Olympic Games and, to add insult to injury, that the United States Olym\u00ad pic Com m ittee could exercise its linguistic property rights in a discrim inatory m anner. D edicated to Tom Waddell, ailing \" Papa\" of th e ; Gay Olympics, the Festival becam e a ; defiant gesture of an independence that I runs far deeper than any w ritten law.

McNeill, moral theologian and psychotherapist from New York City, will speak to Dignity, the organization of gay and lesbian Catholics, on Saturday. July II, 7:30 pm . at Trinity Episcopal Church, Bush and Gough Streets. McNeill will speak on the topic of his upcom ing book. Taking a Chance on God: Liberation Spirituality'from Gay Experience, drawing on his many years of ministry to Dignity and to his clients in psychotherapy. A reception will follow the lecture. A donation is requested at the door. McNeill was recently dism issed from the Jesuit order on the grounds of his public dissent from the Church's teach\u00ad ing on hom osexuality, particularly for his criticism of the Vatican's October 1 9 8 6 letter on hom osexuality. McNeill called it \" cruel, m ean-spirited and violent.\" McNeill founded the New York chapter of Dignity in 1 9 7 3 . He is b e s t known as the author of the 1 9 7 6 book. The Church and the Homosexual, a carefully argued theological appraisal of gay and lesbian people in the Catholic faith. Although the book was published with the perm ission of his religious superiors, the Vatican ordered the per\u00ad m ission rescinded in 1 9 7 7 and forbade McNeill to speak on or publish about homosexuality. In 1 9 8 5 the Vatican fur\u00ad ther ordered him to refrain from any m inistry, public or private, to gay or lesbian people. His statem ent in response to the Oc\u00ad tober 1 9 8 6 letter from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, which called the hom osexual condition \"in\u00ad trinsically disordered,\" prom pted h is dism issal from the Society of Jesus. An appeal for reconsideration was recently denied by the Vatican. McNeill's visit to San Francisco is co\u00ad sponsored by Dignity/San Francisco and the Metropolitan Community Church of San Francisco. n i WEEKLY ALMANAC: When y o u - look at your birth chart, the spokes in the w heel define the param eters of tw elve basic sets of hum an phenom ena: they are called Houses.

Your birth chart is your \" Wizard's Clock.\" You can use it to tell tim e in the ancient way. q> ARIES, THE SHEEP (Mar 2 1 - Apr 1 9 ): Don't you think you're being a little too overprotective these days? Your brilliant healing sm ile is but a thin m irage covering deep internal insecuri\u00ad ty. Is your world falling into harvest? Or is there som ething new about ready to burst forth from seed? Relax and ponder your youth. Call back to m ind those glam orous days w hen being a child felt totally safe. It's a tim e to pro\u00ad tect your innocence m ore than anything else. Q TAURUS, THE OX (Apr 20 May 20): Many Tauruses often find them selves inexplicably short on w ords at tim es like this. After rationalizing th e sam e old assurances over and over,July 10-16, 1987 your logic is beginning to wear very thin. Keep rem inding yourself this is a tim e to shut up and listen to what close friends are trying to say. Listen very closely to your lover this week. There .are treasures to discover not far beneath the surface of ordinary conversation. I I GEMINI, THE WOLF (May 2 1 Jun 20): Scream ing, blinding financial pressure, the kind that shatters all bar\u00ad riers, will bring you several thrills in th e com ing week. But th2ft nothing com\u00ad pared to the pressure of love! When th is week's over you can slow down, save som e m oney, and pay a little m ore at\u00ad tention to your health.

PO Box 8 84561. San Francisco. CA 9 4 18 8 . S I LEO. THE SNAKE (Jul 2 3 - Aug 22): Back and forth, back and forth go the rhythm s of decision-m aking. Some\u00ad tim es \"Yes!\" Som etim es \"No!\" No one honestly knows which way you'll go. Spreading rum ors based on real or im agined im pressions will add to the confusion; center your thoughts on per\u00ad sonal and im m ediate responsibilities. Leave cosm ic questions up to those who have m ore power to answer them . And. by all m eans, use psychic control. Tip VIRGO, THE PIG (Aug 2 3 Sep 22): The future looks wide open from here. There are so many options and no pressing responsibilities. Oh, but there is som eone you should begin to take in\u00ad to consideration when making all th ese long-term plans. Willingly admit that you can't achieve success by yourself. Besides it's m uch m ore fun when h e/sh e w ants to com e along. Build your future around your relationship instead of on top of it.LIBRA. THE LEOPARD (Sep 2 3 - Oct 22): Weird conflicts with neigh\u00ad bors are finally resolved this w eek. If you've been aggravated by m isparked cars or barking dogs, rest assured: th e crisis is about over. You seem m ore willing to let bygones be bygones for the sake of establishing pdace in these ad\u00ad m ittedly cram ped spaces. By the end of next w eek you m ight even be sharing a m eal together. May your truce be lo n g - lived! TfySCORPIO. THE SCORPION (Oct 2 3 - Nov 21): When you get this close to reaching out and touching th e dream , don't stop even if you acciden\u00ad tally notice a few blem ishes and imper\u00ad fections. Accept them wholeheartedly. Once you do, they will disappear into the background, and you'll be ready to em brace the reality you've held only in your im agination for so long. This is a chance to wisely apply your finishing touches to a m asterpiece. y SAGITTARIUS. THE HORSE (Nov 22 - Dec 21): Secrets, secrets, and m ore secrets! Everybody w ants to tell you his/her secrets. Even your b est friend is dying to tell you the w hole truth. Be glad everyone's so confident in your trust, but they m ust sw ear to m utual confidentiality from the very beginning. Later on you wouldn't w ant to be pulled into this dram a as an ac\u00ad com plice. P.S. By week's end you'll have a big secret of your ow n.VSCAPRICORN. THE WHALE (Dec 22 - Jan 19 ): It's Capricorn's nature to overlook minor com plications in order to grasp the big picture, but th is w eek you're advised to pay close atten\u00ad tion to every detail, sim ple and com\u00ad plex. What you perceive as an unneces\u00ad sary delay may be actually a m om ent of incredible breakthrough for your com\u00ad panion. H e/she deserves close atten\u00ad tion.

THE EAGLE (Jan 20 - Feb 18 ): You have about ten m ore working days of com plicated schedules and heavy-duty appointm ents. Con\u00ad sider spending lim e on the beach th is weekend to recharge your chakras. Maintaining a hectic pace can put holes in your aura, god forbid! Twenty-four hours of pam pering with fine foods and tender kisses should do the trick. Then you'll be ready to face the m obs that are patiently waiting for you to g et back to work. H PISCES. THE SHARK (Feb 1 9 - Mar 20): The full m oon just past could have easily distracted your vision with a fabulous new fantasy som ewhere off in the distant future. Very tem pting, in\u00ad deed! Play with the idea for a while to see if it can keep you entertained, but do take your tim e. If you let your im agina\u00ad tion run away with you now, you'll en d up starting all over again at m uch greater expense. Don't be bam boozled. Everything th&glitters is not gold. 14 San Francisco Sentinel July 10, 1987 m i HEALING RESOURCES V A N R. A U L T & S E A N D R A K E Transcending Jargon with Truth New Age Newspeak There's a cloying kind of communication becoming prevalent in these days of spiritual exploration. We call it new age newspeak. You know what newspeak is: it's a kind of talk that says one thing but is used to shroud the true intent behind it. People who em ploy new age new\u00ad speak draw on the glib jargon of the hum an potential m ovem ent. They use it to put people down rather than lift them up, to create division rather than one\u00ad n ess, to harm rather than heal. We believe it's tim e to transcend the buzz\u00ad words of new age new speak and in sist on the living experience of our truth. You've heard this jargon. Much of it originated with EST and similar growth sem inars. And there's nothing wrong with the jargon as long as there's in\u00ad tegrity behind it. But many people who haven't developed integrity are employ\u00ad ing new age newspeak to m anipulate others, m ake them selves seem superior, or to avoid being straightforward. And these m etaphysical dilettantes m ake the transform ation field look like a hangout for hypocrites. Let's look at som e exam ples. It'shis face was slashed open, and required plastic surgery. The em otional traum a was far m ore significant, however. Well-meaning but inept metaphysical\u00ad ly oriented acquaintances responded with, \" Well, what's the lesson here? How did you draw that to you?\" You can be sure. Van was quite busy working out the lesson at that tim e. He really n eeded a hug, and som ething like, \" I'm sorry that happened, and I know you're very angry. What can I do to help?\" The last thing he needed w as other people digging around in the sen\u00ad sitive and painful self-scrutiny that h e w as undergoing to learn how he'd got\u00ad ten into this situation, so he could heal it and never repeat it. Van told those people what anybody had the right to say in such a situation: \"Shut up!\" It's am azing how w e recognize w hen a child or a p et feels lonely and unloved. If we limit ourselves to the surface of reality, we'll find the jargon a seductive tool for our ego's clam or. often said that \"you create your own reality.\" That's true. But we object to the way this concept is used to bludgeon people in painful situations rather than support them towards m astery. A woman that Sean knows was having a rough em otional tim e. She needed a lit\u00ad tle support and called up som e m em bers of a prom inent m etaphysical m inistry. Each one responded with no m ore com passion than a terse, \"You created this. What are you going to do about it?\" Of course, she knew she created her reality. She'd read the books, heard the lectures, and was well aware that sh e w as responsible for what she was ex\u00ad periencing. What she needed at that m om ent was som eone to tell her sh e w as loved! She needed a rem inder that she was capable of meeting*the challenges before her, not a cold- hearted brush-off padded with new age jargon. It never occurred to those peo\u00ad ple that a little warmth and kindness m ight have empowered her to change the reality she'd created. Several years ago, Van went through a dramatic m ugging incident, in w hichWe often respond honestly to them . We hold them , stroke them , give them chicken soup or a cookie. Som ething very m undane, but so real that it 's/ell. Why is it so difficult to be this h onest with adults? We don't analyze our children or pets, or dem and they ex\u00ad plain and heal them selves in their doubtful m om ents. We just love them . Why is this so hard to do with grown m en andl'women? It never hurts to tell som eone, \" I love you\" as long as its honest. You can always acknowledge another person's pain, even if, in your spiritual aware\u00ad n ess, it's illusory, or self-created. You don't have to buy into it, but you can com passionately respond: \" I can s e e how that would be painful for you.\" Or, \" I'm sorry to hear you don't fe el well.\" If in doubt, you can always say, \" I don't know what to say or do. How can I support you?\" Careful discern\u00ad m ent can show you how to lovingly sup\u00ad port without reinforcing the illusion of victim ization. Common sen se and in\u00ad tuition will show you the way to em\u00ad power the other person in a way that can potentially boost him out of his rut.Pontificating and analyzing create separation. Loving, understanding, and acknowledging create oneness. Separa\u00ad tion causes m ore grief; oneness creates the ground of being for healing. Both of u s are in the consulting field, and w e work daily with people's nitty- gritty growth issues. Many tim es people don't need advice at all. TheyAavf their own answers, but they're just having trouble getting to them . Often, nothing m ore is needed than to acknowledge what's going on. and listen n o n - judgm entally. Listening is perhaps the greatest gift you can give a troubled per\u00ad son. because it's the least available thing. And, of course, w hen listening, you aren't busy spew ing jargon. You're just being in the m om ent. With the growth of m etaphysics, there's been a kind of oppressive spiritual correctness surfacing which overrides com m on sense. Students fe el inadequate if they don't handle their life situations just so; they're not supposed to adm it they feel real anger, sorrow, guilt, or confusion. They know they create their own reality but are con\u00ad cerned that they'll look like idiots if they admit to im perfection. There's little room for self-love w hen self-denial and self-flagellation are happening. And there are people who u se spiritu\u00ad al \"correctness\" to push people further into their confusion, rather than sup\u00ad porting them in com ing out of it. New age new speak com m unicates manipu\u00ad lative m essages: \"conform; don't m ake w aves; do it this way; there's only one right way (m ine); you're stupid if you don't see it this way.\" Or. as Archie Bunker u sed to say to Edith, \"Stifle yourself.\" Healthy A n ( \u00ab versus Posltlvs Thinking Our friend, Billy, was being given a job assignm ent by his supervisor at work. It was a cumbersom e task, clumsily assem bled, and could have been set up m uch more easily. Billy complained. His supervisor replied, \"Oh, you're just not being positive positive!\" Instead of acknowleding th e alienation that particular task was in\u00ad spiring, she instead encouraged Billy to stuff his anger further inside, and wear the m ask of false \"positive thinking.\" Billy's com m ent after this incident w as, \"I have absolutely no u se for positive thinking.\" Who could blam e him ? We believe there's a place for th e healthy expression of anger on th e spiritual path. And that it need s to b e expressed. After all, what's m ore spiritual than being totally, com pletely truthful with yourself and the world about how you feel? If you're able to b e truthful, you can m ove through th e conflicts and confusions m ore quickly. If you suppress the truth, m ore m entaldisorder will be created. Eventually, it will have to com e out. But the dilettantes want us to be nice. To think only positively. Because th e \"spiritual\" thing to do is to be nice; polite; don't rock the boat; sm ile no m atter how furious you are. This creates m ore dam age, however. Sean was telling a friend about a per^ son he was angry with. His friend said, \"You're supposed to be nice. You're supposed to only see the God in every\u00ad body. Let your anger go, and see them m ore than what you're perceiving them as at the moment.\" Sean replied, \" Yes, I agree with you intellectually. I know this and you know this, but at this point in my evolutionw e totally internalize the anger energy, then it can blow up from inside. Resent\u00ad m ent has a severely dam aging effect on the physical body if held for a long tim e, so releasing the anger and con\u00ad structively acting upon it while it's hot p revents it from sim m ering into resent\u00ad m ent. The Power of Truth Another anecdote from Billy. He w as dating Steve, a bisexual m an who was a fervent advocate of EST principles, and had the vocabulary to prove it. As the passions ignited, Billy found he wanted to see Steve m ore often, but Steve w as also involved with a woman. Steve be\u00ad cam e increasingly unavailable to Billy. What's more spiritual than being completely truthful with yourself and the world about how you feel? that is not totally integrated into m y consciousness. So what happens is I g e t left with the frustration and anger if I don't express my feelings. Besides that, I feel like we're em otional beings. There's a m isconception that spiritual people aren't supposed to express 'negative' em otions. I don't think anger is necessarily a negative emotion.\" Healing won't occur until the anger is acknowledged, b lessed, understood. The anger is a signal telling us som e\u00ad thing's out of alignm ent som ew here. It can help u s preserve our integrity and im prove the reality we're creating if w e listen to it. There is an im perative with anger that says. \"Deal with this right now . Pay attention, honey.\" If w e don't, ifIt was obvious he wanted to term inate the relationship but wouldn't say so. Certainly, anybody who en g ages another through intimacy could give them the courtesy of an honest explana\u00ad tion if they want to discontinue it. All Steve would give Billy was new age new\u00ad speak: \"Well, what is is. You know, what is is.\" There was no yes or no given, just \"what is is.\" Bewildered. Billy had no idea what this m eant, bu t was not am used. Nor surprisingly, h e wasn't too interested in taking the EST sem inar! People like Steve could u se a course in honest com m unication. We're n ot denigrating EST, for it has been a usefu l tool in the awakening of m any people. C o n tin u e d on n \u00bb x t pa.?

Whal works: Saying exactly w hat you want or don't want in a way you know others will com prehend; showing that you value other people by careful listening and acknowledging that you heard what they said, w hether you agree with it or not; acknowledging painful feelings with \"1 can see how that would be painful for you,\" or \" I'm sorry to hear you're going through such difficulty.\" and m ost of all, \"How can I support or assist you?\" Showing your concern; staying neutral while listening to criticism or harsh words about any\u00ad thing and anyone; not judging a person for not being spiritual enough; rem ind\u00ad ing people of their own ability, value, accom plishm ents and potential. Healing Communication: After acknowledging where they are and hearing from them how you can par\u00ad ticipate in their growth, tell the truth of your heart as you know it. with as m uch sensitivity as possible. Gentleness and tact are often helpful, but can b e eschew ed if they obscure or block your m essage. \"I love you\" often works, but if you can't say that, offer. \"I really ap\u00ad preciate you\" or \" I care about you.\" When saying \" no,\" there's no need to play Attila the Hun.

In the 12 months since his arrest on obscenity charges last June, Jello Biafra has suffered through the end o f his mar\u00ad riage, the break up o f his band, the Dead Kennedys, and a huge loss o f time and pro\u00ad fit from his record company gone comatose. Nonetheless, Biafra is determined to face his self-righteous accusers in a Los Angeles County courtroom this August, and if District Attorney Michael Guarino has his way, Biafra wilt metaphorically die fo r the sins o f rock and rollers everywhere. How excruciatingly ironic it is that dur\u00ad ing the bicentennial of the US Constitu-, tion such an unlikely patriot, a punk rocker named Jello, should be chosen to test,the strength o f the First Amendment (roll over Thomas Jefferson!). Yet, however droll that scenario may appear, both the commercial record industry and those who would censor it are watching Biafra's case very closely. W hat's more, whatever is decided in a Los Angeles. courtroom at the end of that circus will eventually affect the basic freedom of ar\u00ad tistic expression everywhere. \" I'm looking at a one-year prison sentence because of what we said with a record album,\" said Biafra, \" the first direct prosecution of a rock album in American history. My Worst vision would be for this case becoming a precedent enabling them to prosecute every artist I admire. That's a heavy burden to bear.\" In case you hadn't heard, it was last April when nine police officers (6 from the SFPDand 3 from Los Angeles) broke into Biafra's Noe Valley flat (and later, the SOMA office of his record company, Alternative Tentacles), and armed with a search warrant, confiscated company b u sin e ss r e c o rd s , p e rs o n a l c o r\u00ad respondence, a rolodex and several copies o f the Dead Kennedys' latest LP, Frankenchrist, which contained a free, fold-out poster. That poster, a reproduction from apainting titled \" Penis L andscape,\" depicts ten, M .C. Esher-like sets o f rather other-worldly looking male and female genitalia. The artist, H.R. Gieger, won the Academy Award for his visual effects in the film Alien. The original \" Penis Landscape\" was first published in Pent\u00ad house, and now hangs in a Swiss gallery. That surprise search and seizure was the direct result o f a complaint lodged through the mail to the office o f the State Attorney General, by a San Fernando Valley mother who found her 11-year-old son with a copy o f the penis poster. The poster, o f course, came inside a copy of Frankenchrist he'd received for his birth\u00ad day. The birthday gift was purchased by the boy's 14-year-old sister from a Los Angeles Wherehouse Records store which sold her the LP even though a sticker was affixed to the record's shrink-wrap warn\u00ad ing that: . .the inside fold-out to this record cover is a work of art by H.R. Gieger that some people may find shock\u00ad ing, repulsive or offensive. Life can some\u00ad times be that way.\" Two months after the police came to visit, Biafra along with Alternative Ten\u00ad tacles' general manager, owners of two record distribution firms and the printer who assembled the album package \u2014 \" The Frankenchrist Five\" \u2014 were each charged in Los Angeles county with one count of violating California Penal Code 313.1, which forbids distribution of\" harmful material\" to minors and carries a maximum penalty o f one year and/or a $2000 fine. In the past, accusations of reverse satanic lyrics and record album bonfires have succeeded in producing little more than a good chuckle, at best. No one, however, is laughing at the Parents Music Resource Center (PM R Q , least o f all the Recording Industry Association o f America (RIAA), who took a definitive beating at the much-publicized \" pom rock\" hearings in Washington, DC last fall.

What these 'Meeseketeers' have in m ind,\" says Biafra, \" is essentially chastity belts for the eyes.\" While Guarino denies the District At\u00ad torney's office is motivated by any religious or political group, the PMRC nonetheless issued a press release only days after charges were filed claiming that Frankenchrist is a \" blatant example of pornography and fails to acknowledge truth in packaging.\" It concluded that Frankenchrist' s warning sticker failed to C o n tin u e d on p a g e 20 San Francisco Sentinel July 10, 1987 17 lor five years, Tede Matthews has hosted readings at the Modern Times I Bookstore in the Mission.

Guarino assures the painting \" will be judged by itself, o f itself, the way it was presented to the 14-year-old who bought it,\" and insists it will be the poster, not the Dead Kennedys' music that will be on trial. However, the DA does see the case as \" a cost-effective way o f sending out a message to those who seek to profiteer from this sort of marketing\" \u2014 whatever that means. Penis Landscape, like the DKs' aural and visual art in general, is lampooning America's hidden conformism. \" T hat,\" says Barry Lynn o f the ACLU, \" is pre\u00ad eminently political speech, and we know it works, because it annoyed the authorities enough to try to intimidate their critics in\u00ad to submission by calling them obscene. This persecution is a sorry example of just the kind o f government abuse the First Amendment was designed to prevent.\" The Dead Kennedys' last performance was last year at UC Davis. Biafra flatly refuses to discuss any details surrounding the break-up o f the group. \"Things aretough enough there as it is. I don't want to get into gossip now.\" Will the Dead Ken\u00ad nedys ever regroup? \" Never,\" says Biafra, \" there's no sense in beating a dead horse.\" Though, \" with a break in the ac\u00ad tion like this, I figure it's now or never as far as my art goes, which is why I've been experimenting with spoken word per\u00ad formance and other stuff.\" Those spoken word performances are built from bits o f stand-up comedy, re\u00ad vised song lyrics and a lot o f current event anecdotes, most o f which are sent to Biafra from around the country. On one o f many recent trips to Los Angeles for various legal chores, Biafra taped three spoken word vignettes for MTV, sched\u00ad uled to air on a segment of MTV's revived \"Cutting Edge\" hour, July 23, and again on the 26th. After the trial \u2014 if he's lucky \u2014Biafra's first order o f business will be building a new band and finding a new sound. \" I'd like to use the same kind of pile-driving rhythms and morbid atmos\u00ad pheres that the DKs did. I do not want to go heavy metal nor do I want to wimp out and go college radio. Who knows, maybe an industrial version of Phil Harris is the way to go.\" In the meantime, the continuing legal battle demands his complete attention. \" The more it goes on, the madder I get. I'd much rather be on stage, making music than dealing with the phone, the mail and research \u2014 I'm sick o f it!\" There are plans for the release o f a Dead Kennedys retrospective LP, featur\u00ad ing various live and unreleased collectibles from the band's history. Ideally, Biafra would like to release the album before the trial begins. However, \" We still have toraise another $40,000 before the trial in August. If Alternative Tentacles has to pay for all that, then we're not going to put out any more records, thus the pros\u00ad ecutor achieves his goal. What kind of freedom o f speech is that when you can't afford to speak?\" The \" Frankenchrist Five\" are repre\u00ad sented by a group o f lawyers that includes a civil and a criminal attorney, as well as various ACLU members. The better part of that legal counsel is being donated by the attorneys involved. Still, guilty or in\u00ad nocent, court costs will probably run in the neighborhood o f $200,000. To date, over $160,000 has been raised through donations from friends and supporters, not from megabuck record companies who, one would think, would have a vested interest in Biafra's survival. Biafra and others believe there's a not- so-subtle strategy being applied here. Why go after the big fish like Prince or Wherehouse Records, when you can ef\u00ad fectively attack the smallest fish who can't afford the expensive legal defense the big guys can. \" In the long run, I'm really in the rude position o f having to defend artists whose work I really don't care for like Judas Priest, Slayer or George Michaels. On the other hand, just because their material bores me doesn't mean it should be banned. \" People like Ed Meese and the PMRC would like us to believe that the Dead Ken\u00ad nedys' albums are harmful to minors while claiming 'Star Wars' is perfectly safe \u2014 they're even trying to tout 'Star Wars' as some kind o f peace shield for humanity.

Their recent Beethoven Festival resurrected some of the most beaten-to-death works in their repertory. Kurt Masur and the or\u00ad chestra restored to the symphonies and overtures compelling energy and vivid excitement. Alfred Brendel, playing all five of the piano concertos, added poetic insights of nearly unparalleled depth. The combination was dynamite.pressure often reaches volcanic proportions. For this reason, orchestras play them again and again. And we listen over and over. Even a relatively inert reading can rouse passion in an audience, because there is so much energy there bursting to be free. Even the mildest attention can seem like profound concentration, for there is so much grabbing at awareness. The revolutionary power, which is the reason they are repeated so frequently, is nevertheless exactly what is at stake. The figures in all this who best recreate revolution amid so much familiarity are the conduc-The SF Symphony's invita\u00ad tion to Kurt M asur and Alfred Brendel to team up for this year's Beethoven series was a master\u00ad stroke. M asur, one o f the most openhanded o f the conductors on the scene today, tapped d ire c tly in to B e e th o v e n 's carefully controlled bravado. He d e lig h ted in th e sp len d id melodies naturally, making them shine naively. When he came to one o f those energizing turns of thought, however, he showed that there was nothing naive about his approach. He had been planning for those moments all along. Without any extra hulla\u00ad baloo, these expected inten\u00ad sifications serv ed to turn the con\u00ad ductor inward toward the core of himself and the center o f the music's power. The result was planned, yet not self-conscious, at the same time. Brendel, on the other hand, is oneof the most self-conscious of today's artists. The object for Brendel is to understand the logic behind the notes. He is always searching for the subliminal message in the melody, and he accents every note in accordance with his vision o f it. This search for continually deeper meaning can be a trap. The last thing we need is any more quirkiness from performers. Brendel escapes faddishness for three reasons: because he has such an interesting mind, because his interpretations are based on such a precise rhythmic sense, and because he never uses them to hide deficiencies in his tech-TheSan Francisco Symphony has frequently been playing with m ore self-confidence, greater volume, and greater delight since their wham-bang European tour this spring. T he Beethoven Festival brought the strings to a new plateau o f accomplishment. The cellos have long been the glory o f the orchestra: their tone is rich and their synchronicity astounding. Now the basses have added themselves to that select category. Their round, dark sound is calling out for special notice. It seems churlish to chide the violins for a certain thinness on the top, for they played these m am m oth sym phonies with such apt phrasing, such clean ar\u00ad ticulation and such gusto. F ur\u00ad therm ore, they spent almost all o f the time in tune. The violas, like the other lower strings, are basking in a fuller, deeper sound than they have known previous\u00ad ly, and a new lyricism is entering their phrasing. Alas, the winds and the brass did not equal their stringed Writing Class Begins July 14 Openings are available in Steve A bbott's \" Gay and Lesbian Writing Class\" starting Tues\u00ad day, July 14, at 8 to 10 pm.

Beethoven exposed his wind players mercilessly in his symphonies. Symphony No. 6, for example, is a veritable con\u00ad certo grosso for the winds. But too often the San Francisco players sounded jagged. Only the oboist maintained a consis\u00ad tent level o f finesse. Two dif\u00ad ferent flutists failed what I came to call the Alfred Brendel test. In both the Third and Fifth Con\u00ad certos, there comes a moment when the flute and piano must play together. As Brendel ap\u00ad proached each passage, he looked up over at the flutists so that they might meld together, but neither San Francisco player looked back. In the Sixth Symphony, the clarinetist's upper register was so squeaky that he looked visibly chagrined when M asur asked him to take a solo bow. But M asur used this trick another time: when the French hornist pulled a typical boner in the Fidelio overture, he asked the player, who would have rather sunk through the floor, to take aspecial bow. Perhaps the con\u00ad ductor has fgured out that a little extra limelight might shame these players into greatness. The problem with Beethoven is not in the notes, however, but in the spirit. The revolutionary explosion that his music repre\u00ad sents changed the musical world. No one, not even W agner, wrecked such havoc on accepted norms. The titanic force that his symphonies encapsulate is the reason they sit at the center o f every orchestra's repertory \u2014 from smalltown amateurs to the Vienna Philharmonic. Beethoven planned it that way, for the germs o f his sym\u00ad phonies are little nuggets o f Pianist Alfred Brendel. amazingly compressed energy, and the composer used his inven\u00ad tions in formal logic not so much to express this energy as to inten\u00ad sify it.

Though the need to reimagine newness afflicts the work o f all dead com\u00ad posers, the problem is central to performing Beethoven, because the composer made such an issue o f revolution in his music.nique. My favorite concert in the series was the one featuring the Second and Third Concertos. First o f all, the program cleverly su rro u n d ed them w ith the F idelio O v e rtu re an d the Leonore Overture No. 3, so that the evening was itself replete with internal references. M asur was all jovial power in the Fidelio piece and demonic fury by the end o f the Leonore. At the piano Brendel contrasted the two con\u00ad certos by shading the first with Haydnesque wit and propound\u00ad ing the third with oracular mysticism. This year set a stan\u00ad dard for all future festivals.

I L M L__I E R N A ___N Film Festival Seminar Report What Is Lesbian Filmmaking? Part of this year's Lesbian and Gay Film Festival was a seminar called \" Mainstream\u00ad ing: Lesbian Filmmaking in the '80s.\" It was held free as a public forum in response to con\u00ad cern among lesbians last year that the Festival did not adequately present lesbian points of view. About 300 women and a couple of men at\u00ad tended what turned out to be a stimulating dialogue with five filmmakers and a moderator. tions what does it mean to be mainstream, and does it work for or against us? For me, these questions imply more than bringing lesbians or lesbianism to a broader au\u00ad dience. With the growth of video and cable com petition, the changes in tax laws, and the anti-\" special interest\" ideologyAfter last year's controversies over Dime A Dance Romance (lesbians walked out en masse in response to d epictions o f male/male and hetero sex in what was billed as a lesbian film), 1 was expecting fireworks. Al\u00ad though these concerns were raised, i.e., why so much hetero sex in lesbian films, it quickly became clear that the panel was not there to \" represent\" lesbian filmmakers. Each artist present\u00ad ed her own take on what main- streaming means in the context of lesbian films \u2014 and in her work in particular. Their diverse perspectives prompted a lively consideration of many of the major questions facing lesbian filmmakers in 1987. Since Desert H earts was released last year and Working Girls this year, lesbians have hit the big screen. Lesbian films in general, though their numbers are still few, are reaching larger audiences than they did ten years ago. The forum asked the ques-of the Reagan Administration, the movie industry has become so much more commodified in the last ten years that any kind of alternative voice has a harder struggle to be heard.

Many of the issues were com\u00ad mon to alternative film and video. Others were specifically lesbian concerns. For me, the most hopeful aspect o f the discussion was its open-ended- ness.

As a lesbian critic, I feel it is important not to ghettoize and fight over crumbs, but to sup\u00ad port and challenge our non\u00ad lesbian counterparts in alter\u00ad native media to join us in resisting the dominant culture. We need to provide images that express the reality and diversity of our lives, contradicting the persistence of stereotypes and in\u00ad visibility.

Questions weren't debated so much as simply asked. The only definite answer that came out of the discussion was that we need more money. (This may seem self-ev id en t, but I 'm told Frameline received several new memberships and contributions after the forum.) Each panelist made a state\u00ad ment before questions were taken from the floor. Andrea W eiss ( International Sweet\u00ad hearts o f Rhythm, Before Stone\u00ad wall) sppke of the importance o f presenting images o f gay peo\u00ad ple who weren't types tradi\u00ad tionally seen as gay (as she tried to do in Before Stonewall). Sheila McLaughlin (SheM ust Be Seeing Things, C om m itted) wanted to see her films reach a wider audience than the lesbian community \u2014 she used the com\u00ad parison of \" Indians selling trin\u00ad kets (sic) on the reservation\" \u2014 yet expressed concern that too much mainstreaming can result in abandoning the lesbian au\u00ad dience, as in Desert Hearts not being offered to gay and lesbian film festivals. Frances Reid became a cine\u00ad matographer (Times o f Harvey Milk, Living with AIDS, What We Take fo r Granted) to get away from the rigors of indepen\u00ad dent producing, and has made m any films having lesbian characters or by lesbian film\u00ad makers that wouldn't be called lesbian films. She sees the \" broadening out\" away from purely lesbian subject matter as both sad and good \u2014 that basic\u00ad ally it's a healthy sign that we candiscussion barely touched on). M oderator Debra Zimmer\u00ad man (of New York's Women Make Movies) provided back\u00ad ground information on funding trends and options, for which the au d ien ce was p a rticu la rly hungry. The consensus of the panel seemed to be that lesbian film- making has moved beyond sex\u00ad ual identity as the primary sub\u00ad ject matter. Jealousy, work and oppression by the State were ex\u00ad amples of current topics given by Hammer, who said \" the most important thing about being a lesbian to me is being radical, taking risks, changing percep\u00ad tions. Changing what you're used to seeing on film .\" Although I may disagree with some of the ways she would go about this, the idea o f using our marginality in the culture to open up new ways of seeing is a lot of what makes lesbian filmmaking exciting to me. T here was discussion of whether narrative \" plot-point\" filmmaking was viable. Hammer called plot points \" male points,\" explaining, \" We cannot repro\u00ad duce our vision using the form of narrative cinema that the domi-- nant culture uses.\" I questioned this by raising the example of Working Girls as a film which uses a narrative structure yet breaks with sexist forms by film\u00ad ing nudityinade-objectified.de- . sexualized way. Another hot topic was can white people make films about people of other cultures. One au\u00ad dience member was angry that \" funds always seem to go to white lesbians who end up mak\u00ad ing the only films about lesbians o f color.\" There was disagreement on the all-white panel as to whether white lesbians could make films about non-whites. Frances Reid, however, made the most sense, by bringing the issue back around to money \u2014 getting funding is even harder for les\u00ad bians of color than for white les\u00ad bians. Still, she added, \" this doesn't mean a white filmmaker can't make films about other kinds of people. The important thing to address is how money can be better distributed to get a broader perspective for the enrichment of all of us.\" Non\u00ad white lesbian representation on the panel would have made this part of the discussion more useful. The consensus o f the panel seemed to be that lesbian filmmaking has moved beyond sexual identity as the primary subject matter. make films about things that are not lesbian issues in a narrowly defined sense. Barbara Hammer (Snow Job, Optic Nerve, and 40 other films) views the current mainstreaming trend of \" lesbian yuppies sup\u00ad porting erotic video with fantasy foreplay\" with a nostalgia for the radicalism of the '70s that already seems a relic. West German director Alex\u00ad andra von Grote (November- m o o n , D epart to A rrive, Frameline 1987 award winner) talked about how homophobia has a ff e c te d her c a re e r. Although both of her films made money, she is now unbankable in Germany because of her les\u00ad bianism and lesbian subject mat\u00ad ter. She stressed the need to fight1 against the homophobia not only of heterosexuals, but also of %closeted gays in the movie business (a hot issue that <$eA Maori woman reminded the group that New Zealand has an active lesbian culture and that if lesbians would look interna\u00ad tionally (and beyond the Nor\u00ad thern Hemisphere) the view is less bleak \u2014 a lot is happening. In New Zealand, she mentioned, filmmakers are able to make films for television in order to fund other film projects. This was a good reminder for me of the special difficulties American alternative media faces when try\u00ad ing to compete with the Holly\u00ad wood machine. The funding picture in this country was encapsulated by Zimmerman, who noted that \" most funding sources don't even fund media. O f those that do, most don't fund women. Cut that figure down another 90% to see how much funding goes to lesbians.\" Weiss added that C o n tin u e d on p a g e 30 22 San Francisco Sentinel July 10, 1987 H E A T E R DENNIS HARVEY New Performance Festival The Greatest Show of the Month A merican Inroads' New Performance Festival continues through the end of this month, pursuing its aim \"to create a new standard for new work,\" yet manifesting choices ranging from the striking to the merely curious. As the Festival gears up for its big guns \u2014 a full staging of Murray Mednick's nine-hour Coyote Cycle, and the latest visual extravaganza from George Coates \u2014 here's a look at some recent Festival offerings. Kuniko Kisanuki's hour-long Tefu Tefu 6 brought all the Festival's aims into sharp focus for five nights. Famous and well- awarded on her home soil, Japan\u00ad ese Butoh dancer Kisanuki's \"Tefu Tefu\" works spring from a childhood m em ory th at she claims seeded her artistic nature. At the age o f six she captured but\u00ad terflies (tefu tefu) in her net, only to find them lifeless when she repentantly decided to release th e m . H ow f u n n y /s a d /, ethereal/etc. Fortunately, she's gotten past the need to portray those lachry\u00ad mose specifics by now. Tefu Tefu % is open to any interpretation you choose, though general the\u00ad matic rumblings o f repression, evolution, transformation and release are hard to miss. What's more important is the inventiveness o f K isanuki's physical expression, and hermoment. The Kronos Quartet has lately won flak for some tac\u00ad tics by which they've won a wide audience. The string quartet's ad\u00ad vocacy of 20th-century music, especially new works, has been in\u00ad creasingly wrapped in a sort of art-school New Wave image that's about five dead-earnest years behind these post-punk times. I'm pretty much a Cowell/ Partch/Berio man myself, so it's hard not to applaud getting that New Music groove out in any form the public will swallow. Still, the Kronos Performance \u2014 and we're talking Performance ART, man \u2014 commissioned for the Festival was mighty silly for the most part. The choice o f pieces played was attractive if underwhelming. It ranged from a series o f indif\u00ad ferent fragments culled from John Lurie's Stranger Than Japanese Butoh dancer Kisanuki' s \"Tefu Tefu\" works spring from a childhood memory that she claims seeded her artistic nature. powerful persona] magnetism. She enters and finally exits through the Palace of Fine Arts' lobby, chalk-faced and transfixed like a post-prom Carrie White. Crawling onto the stage, she undergoes a series o f twisting, slow-motion birthing agonies under the spare lighting scheme and against an arresting back\u00ad drop of canvas sails. Her tentative flappings are like those of the first emigrants from the primordial soup; her body struggles for dignity, only to be thrust fetal-like against the floor again and again. When her muta\u00ad tions finally seem to reach some sort o f breakthrough point, the triumph is still shrewdly held back from sentimentality \u2014 balletic leaps of joy are compromised by a lingering awkwardness, by little mincing steps and seizures o f con\u00ad tortion. Managing to seem natural even in the most trying, one-legged positions, Kisanuki demonstrates but never calls attention to what must be a most remarkable flex\u00ad ibility and muscular control. (She can even make her feet ripple at will.) Only the climactic chug-a- lugging, synthetic strains o f Bun Itakura's hithero lean score (and rather coy curtain-call dance) provided crude notes in this ex\u00ad quisitely intense performance. S om e a rtis ts n atu ra lly , gravitate toward work that can be considered avant-garde. Others willfully grope for the Badge of Coolness via whatever means are considered most modem at theParadise soundtrack to Kevin Volan's White Man Sleeps, a charmingly loose, impressionistic take on the more lyrical moods of Ives, Copland and their like. There were also works by Chinese modernist Ge Gan-run, Finnish composer Aulius Sallinen, the Polish composer Kryzstof Pen\u00ad derecki, and the Quartet itself. Undercutting rather than ad\u00ad ding to these works, however, - was the whole elaborate schemata of presentation. Now, I don't want to totally disparage the in\u00ad put o f \" visual designer\" Larry Huff, whose settings were mostly handsome and whose lighting was often spectacular and sur\u00ad prising. But overall the evening's visual design was mostly about how studiedly cool the four Kronos musicians are. Wow! First violinist David Harrington opened the show by casually stub\u00ad bing out his cig and wearily lifting that mean-machine^Stradivarius from its case under a lone spotlight \u2014 cooler than \" Miami Vice\" even! Then, all four musi\u00ad cians took a break to put on their crinkly white Devo jumpsuits! Solemnly puttering about the \" sparse\" clutter o f those (what else but?) black/white/grey set\u00ad tings! The evening ended with a Kronos \" composition\" that was basically an improvised excuse for arch wizardry: blowing on miked instruments, cutting up paper backdrops, tumbling props to the ground. There's a fine line between gen\u00ad uine daring and trend-humpingNew performance personalities: a member o f Australia's Circus brattiness, and with their Paiace performances the Kronos Quar\u00ad tet has now crossed that line by a country mile. Do the Kronos musicians really think this silliness adds to the composers' works, or is music no longer their primary concern? There indeed ought to be room for more flexibility in \"serious\" musical presentations than the usual stolidity in tux\u00ad edos, but this attempt at '80s packaging wasn't the answer. There isn't a great deal to be said from this corner about Australia's Circus Oz, which con\u00ad tinues performing at the Palace of Fine Arts through this Sunday. However, any further comment should be prefaced by saying that circuses have never been and pro\u00ad bably never will be, my particular cup o f art, spectacle, or even camp. The 15-member Circus Oz bills itself as \" totally non-nuclear, non-sexist, anti-Contra,\" and promises a uniquely nutty view of its own \u2014 a politically-correct one at that. Its current show has everything but the proverbial kit\u00ad chen sink. Yet it seems essentially directionless, with no bite (and not even much bark) to its politics beyond a spot of crossdressing and the odd sarcastic quip. Its satire is vague at most (as in a se\u00ad quence o f business-suited robotic tumbling), and non-existent the rest of the time. O f course, you may not require narrative, content, or even some sort of unifying attitude from a circus. The annoying thing is that Oz's eclectic mix seems to pro-' mise something extra, some con\u00ad ceptual smarts that never arrive. There are a few amazing things to be had here: a startling (if pro\u00ad longed) upside-down walking ef\u00ad fect; cheerful (if prolonged) gling/comedy duet for two quasi\u00ad gay men named Maurice; some wonderful Chinese hoop-jump- ing; and an audience-participa- tion climax that ambles its (pro\u00ad longed) way to a great anticlimac- tic joke. Kids will love this stuff, and anyone would enjoy the troupe's energy, good nature, and colorful costumes. On the other hand, patrons o f all ages will hold their ears over the very loud and fre\u00ad quently bland (when not flavored by the occasional Chinese or aboriginal influence) live musicaldancer Kuniko Kisanuki Oeft) and Oz. accompaniment. And with its ten-year history, it's a bit difficult to forgive Oz all its sloppy in\u00ad dulgences \u2014 the rambling com\u00ad edy skits, the tendency toward aimless improv, and the dreadful\u00adly incongruous solo acoustic song. It's hard not to like Circus Oz \u2014 or anybody, for that matter, who can slide down a pole face- first. But the amount o f slack in this show makes it difficult to love them. Still, if you have a taste for pure spectacle, in rather loose wrapping, this package from down under may be for you.

A T CASTRO-552-2253 O PEN SEVEN DAYS A W EEKE C O N D g l a n c e : S T E V E B O T T Virtue's Path Recently I've taken an unholy and mischievous glee in the media war between Jerry Falwell and Jim and Tammy Bakker. What's more entertaining than watching two sets of thieving hypocrites \u2014 the former a prude, the latter flamboyantly outrageous \u2014 tear into one another? It's like watching Polonius and Falstaff go at it with Lady Macbeth in the wings wailing, laughing and obsessively washing her hands. But wait, Shakespeare's char\u00ad acters only committed their folly on stage and, in the context of the plays, their behavior is cathartic. Jerry, Jim and Tam\u00ad my, however, (despite their tele\u00ad vised theatrics) suck up real money from real people. The bigoted escapism and prurient spiritual consumerism they pro\u00ad mote affects millions. I was thinking o f this as 1 re\u00ad read Plato's Protagoras. If you recall, Socrates' young friend Hippocrates comes banging onSocrates takes Hippocrates to see Protagoras and, in front of everyone, shows Hippocrates that Protagoras doesn't know what he's talking about. Pro\u00ad isn't lustfully crass (as Alcibiades is) but Protagoras' flowery speeches are nonetheless bullshit. Protagoras, like today's TV evangelists, proposes to teach virtue without having a clear notion as to what virtue is. Socrates begins by suggesting virtue is not teachable to which Protagoras retorts it is. By thebecomes irate. \" You're cretiniz- ing my argument,\" he com\u00ad plains. Where Alan and 1 disagree is this: He believes in a hierarchical language o f origins (rationality is prior to irrationality, etc.). I can find no logical or experiential basis for this. By definition, neither term can exist without (or be prior to) its opposite. One might as well argue whether the chicken or egg came first. But the implications o f our disagreement are major \u2014 witness the actions o f the French-educated Cambo\u00ad dian Communists. Whenever life doesn't fit philosophy's neat categories, the temptation o f the intellectual is to pull out Pro- crusteus' bed. (When guests came to Procrusteus' inn who were too tall or too short for his beds, he cut off their feet or stretched them on a rack until they fit.) Political and art language are equally prone to such reduction- ism and the young, in their en\u00ad thusiasm to find a clear and dis\u00ad tinct identity, are especially susceptible to its allure. * * * Then there's Don, slightly older than Alan but also bright and volatile. W hereas Alan places too much faith in bound\u00ad aries, Don often places too little value in them. Like Alcibiades, the philosopher's door in the wee morning hours. \" Protagoras has come to town,\" the boy shouts. Plato describes the dialogue that follows. \" Knowing how bold and vola\u00ad tile he is, [Socrates] remarked, 'But what has this got to do with you? Do you have some charge to bring against Protagoras?' \" 'Indeed I do, Socrates,' he laughed. 'That he alone is wise, but is not making me wise.' \" 'Oh yes he will, by Zeus,' I said. 7 / you give him money and persuade him, he'll make you wise too.'\" (Italics mine.) Hippocrates persists and begs Socrates to introduce him to Protagoras. Socrates replies by asking in what capacity, and to what end Hippocrates would be employing Protagoras. \" Do you know what a risk you're about to take with your mincP.\" Socrates continues. \" If you had to place your body in someone's care at the risk o f its becoming good or bad, you would at least consult the advice of your friends and family. But here you're about to risk your mind, by which your entire wel\u00ad fare is determined, in the hands of someone you know nothing a b o u t. . . .B ew are, m y dear boy, you may be dicing with your dearest possession.\" As the dialogue progresses,end o f the dialogue, Socrates has ironically reversed their posi\u00ad tions. This story (written between 400-300 BC) has a further and more personal meaning for me thah any mere comparison be\u00ad tween Falwell and Protagoras, or even such timely asides as, \" The masses notice hardly any\u00ad thing for themselves, merely ac\u00ad claim ing w hatever leading citizens pronounce.\" I haveDon seeks power and control through a playful flirtatiousness. He uses his seductive humor to subvert the logocentric reduc- tionism Alan espouses. But Don wants to have his cake and eat it too, to be taken seriously and not taken seriously at the same time. In his impulsiveness, Don re\u00ad minds me o f Hippocrates. For instance, he wants to be re\u00ad spected but often hangs out with those who don't respect him and Respect is not a right like freedom or a gift like love. It's something that must be earned on the basis o f one's behavior and accomplishments. young friends, too. Their thirst for knowledge, as well as their vulnerability to misguidance, is ju st as stro n g as th a t o f Socrates' friends. Take Alan, who at the age of 18, has a more brilliantly logical mind than I do. For Alan, Sartre, Marx and Hegel are light reading. If only society would accommodate, or be amelio\u00ad rated by this specialized, tech\u00ad nical language, all would be well. But when I point out the slippery and metaphorical basis o f this philbsophical writing, Alanwhom he doesn't respect \u2014 like Norman, an acquaintance, who uses Don to get at me. * * * Norman's egotistical and sex\u00ad ually objectifying chatter is as smarmy as Jim Bakker's. I dis\u00ad agree with his aesthetic values, find his behavior insulting and resent his insinuating an in\u00ad timacy with me that's never ex\u00ad isted and never will. Unlike Socrates, unfortunately, I have not yet decisively communicated this to Norman. The usual subtle social hints have not sufficed. So C o n tin u e d o n p a g t 30 24 San Francisco Sentinel July 10, 1987 Three Noteworthy Shows Summer in the City EAR-RE2*N1GANT L0UH6E 1 3 1 G O O G H ST Sunday Brunch free Champagne LIVE MUSIC NIGHTLY Dinner Wednesday thru SundaySummer in San Francisco has traditionally been a slow season for art. Slow enough, at least, to inspire the SF Art Dealers Association's annual Introductions series, a showcase of new artists during the month of July. This event has had the effect of enlivening the entire local art scene. 1987 also has the added inspiration of be\u00ad ing the 20th anniversary of the Summer of Love. The number of worthwhile exhibitions seems to have expanded beyond its usual level. Unable to settle on just one, I've reviewed three. The notion o f transform ing unused buildings into temporary exhibition spaces is one that has been with us for some time. New York's East Village art scene had its late '70s start in the renegade spirit o f exhibiting artwork in soon-to-be-demolished build\u00ad ings. The freedom from the con\u00ad straints o f the building's preciousness made for some very exciting work, much o f which has defined current aesthetics. The general acceptance o f this kind o f exhibition space is ex\u00ad emplified in LA 's Temporary Contem porary, which success\u00ad fully combines the excitement of a raw space with a museum for\u00ad m at. X \u2014 The Unknown is a large group show, housed in a South- of-Market warehouse space, that attempts to perpetuate a power\u00ad ful underground aesthetic. The show is an impressive undertak\u00ad ing \u2014 a sprawling conglom er\u00ad ation o f work by 23 artists, each am ply rep re se n te d , in a dramatic, raw building. While X offers a wonderful opportunity to see a large quantity o f work by X \u2014 The Unknown ends up being more about the current businesslike state o f art than it is about discovering artists that are new and exciting. \" emerging\" local artists, much of the pieces seem out o f place in this environment. There is a sense o f deja vu, as much o f the work doesn't seem so different, than that seen in alternative spaces ten years ago. The show was conceived by curator Michele Ellis as an alter\u00ad native to the commercial In\u00ad troductions event. X does func\u00ad tion well as an opportunity to see new artists (and some familiar ones), but m ore often than not, the work exhibited doesn't really live up to its alternative label. X seems clearly to be a commercial venture. This would not be so bother\u00ad some if the show weren't market\u00ad ed in such an \" underground\" manner. The show has a trendy name, the announcement takes the form o f an underground newspaper, and the location leads one to expect work o f a m ore \" cutting-edge\" nature. There is, however, good work to be found here: Anne Veraldi's impressive corrugated card\u00ad board fugures, Alan R ath's video sculpture, and Carrie Ivederer's paintings o f inscribed figures are all especially appeal\u00ad ing. X \u2014 The Unknown ends up being more about the current businesslike state o f art .than it isthe sculpture illuminates itself with tiny bulbs. The viewer must turn a switch in order to activate the movement in the piece. As there are thirty sculptures in the show, this becomes an engaging, interactive process. But it is never a gleeful one, as there always re\u00ad mains an underlying om inous\u00ad ness to the work. The flicking of switches invites the viewer into the work rather than serving as a mechanical distraction. There is a strong sense o f op\u00ad posites in this sculpture: in\u00ad dividual pieces are at once childlike and perverse, innocent and dirty, delicate and strong. Objects that look like rats en\u00ad cased in cement twirl gracefully around a maypole. A piece that appears fragile vibrates furiously when it is switched on. There is a \" femaleness\" present in many o f the pieces, but the materials used are hardly girlish. The show's size creates a strong environment. The flicker o f lights and the whir o f motors m ake the exhibit seem almost alive. In some ways, the en\u00ad vironmental duality distracts from the individuality o f the pieces. As they are made from similar materials and formats, the sculptures assert their in\u00ad dividuality slowly. This is a showabout discovering artists that are new and exciting. The large exhibition of sculpture by Leslie Van Scoyoc, at Media,.turns the gallery into a land of glittering, somewhat per\u00ad verse enchantm ent. The pieces are striking combinations o f light, movement, and a minimal use o f color. The sculptures are often tableaux with moving parts that bring to mind decrepit c a ro u sels, the dangerous- looking windmills at Altamont, and gauzy phallic vibrators. Ranging in size from a stereo turntable to a small tree, the sculptures are composed o f a black base, a small light, and a viewer-activated moving ele\u00ad m ent. Van Scoyoc's materials are earthy and initially unappeal\u00ad ing. They include gauze, fish hooks, cobwebs, barbed wire, and dry, lifeless vines. They are whitewashed, blackened, or painted silver to fit into an aesthetic o f darkness. The total effect is something like a child's nightlight that has mutated in the dark. \\ The gallery is darkened, and Untitled, crayon on paper drawing, 30 x 34\", from Brad M elamed's \" series. that requires leisurely investiga\u00ad tion, it takes time to acclimate to its aesthetic. Van Scoyoc's dark\u00ad ly enchanted world is one well worth investigating. The 20th anniversary o f the I Summer of Love is proving to be quite an inspiration for artists and gallery events. H erb Greene's photographs o f San Francisco in 1967 and a forth\u00ad coming exhibition of blotter acid prints at the Art Institute both offer a perfect throwback to that bygone era. Recently, New York artist Brad M elam ed's 1967 Summer o f Love 1987, at the In\u00ad tersection, offered a more con\u00ad temporary angle on the subject. The show is about opposites and the reality that often lies'in- between. The sexual attitudes o f 1967 can be seen as an indirect opposite o f those in 1987 (e.g.,Free Love/Safe Sex). Melamed's work is concerned with just such dichotomies. The show consists of drawings o f a n to n y m o u s ( \" C o n \u00ad d o n e/C o n d em n ,\" \" H o m o / H e te ro \" ) an d lik e-so u n d - ing(\" Simulate/Stimulate\" ) texts that frame drawn images o f in\u00ad determinate body parts which are engaged in ambiguous sexual positions. The irpage is not near\u00ad ly as clear as the contradictory nature o f the text. The juxtaposi\u00ad tion of visual and verbal elements begins to explore the realm where language ceases to be ac\u00ad curate. Words do not necessarily portray the reality o f the sexual act. The text \" T op/B ottom \" reveals nothing about the posi\u00ad tion o f the limbs in the am \u00ad biguous drawing. In the moment o f action, the power structure isSummer o f Love, 1967-1987\" rendered obsolete. The show's focal point is a col\u00ad laborative installation made up o f three large panels, similar in format to the drawings, painted directly on the wall. These in\u00ad clude text, but the figurative ele\u00ad ment o f the drawings has been replaced with simple, ambiguous diagrams. Between the panels hang A n\u00ad drea Evans' white-on-white iconographic portraits M orrison, and Janis Joplin. The portraits, when seen from different angles, take on the quality o f positive and negative photographic im\u00ad ages, m irroring the opposite nature o f the nearby text. These '60s icons are placed in a precari\u00ad ous position between the positive and negative aspects o f their C o n tin u e d o n p a g e 30 San Francisco Sentmef July 10, 1987 25 V Comic Book Opera Would you believe a sax-based jazz trio with Middle-Eastern chops?

Now a Sire j Records functionary based in j Palm Tree-ville, Howie will be advising M ad o n n a, for in \u00ad stance, on shaving techniques. Like Ronald Reagan attem pt\u00ad ing to leave a legacy from his shattered ad m inistration by nominating super-conservative Robert Bork to the Supreme Court, Howie left his legacy in a \" Faves o f SF\" piece in the July Calendar magazine before scut\u00ad tling out o f town; it included a nice little item about this space. But when I ran into Howie at his ; June 8 Paradise Lounge going- | away party, he said it had engen- j dered a petite brouhaha: a cer- i tain Rock Previews writer was i so furious at being left out o f !

During the debate, each presi\u00ad dential candidate presented a videotaped segment (which, in a hilarious July 3 piece on the show, S F Examiner TV crit Joyce Millman likened to video dating service come-ons), in which he posed, sometimes with his family, to delineate his back\u00ad ground and beliefs. Since the choice o f First Sdn is key to our nation's happiness, I repeatedly viewed these video segments in an attempt to flush out a likely victor. M ark your ballots: M att Gephardt, 16, is tall, blond, and \" has just received his driver's license,\" accordingto his father, Rep. Richard \" Dick\" Gephardt. In the video, Matt appeared nervously allur- ing: he clutched his large hands \u2014 with their long, artistic and shapely fingers \u2014 in front of new, button-fly 501s, which showed a discernible, if unin\u00ad tentional, bulge. If elected, Matt will enter J office at 17, and will grow into | his early 20s during his tenure\u2014 ; I a prime developmental period, ! | which should make for excellent | news copy (and photos). Sadly, j I it's unlikely he'll ever take of- j j fice: his father is a moronic, i stentorious Max H eadroom j knock-off who, according to a . I recent New York Times article, reversed his support o f a House i bill removing sexual preference from governmental hiring con\u00ad siderations; referring to the issue o f homos in the military, the elder Gephardt bleated, \" I don't know my policy on th at.\" M artin S im on, son o f Senator Paul, appeared to be in his early- to mid-twenties; he eschewed his father's trademark bow tie for a purple alligator sh irt, slacks, an d stylishly collar-length hair. Though he exhibited expensive-looking biceps and a generally languor\u00ad ous air o f ye nesais quoi, young Simon is a less-than-ideal First Son candidate: there's a good change that the nominal belly he | displayed Friday will develop j into an unsightly, lumpy bulge i over his belt, placing him in ! company with most male law\u00ad makers in Washington. The clear leaders in the race I for White House bunk beds are j Christopher and T .J. Babbitt, sons o f Arizona Rep. Bruce Babbitt. Chris appears to be about 14, T .J. 12; this means they'd take office at 15 and 13, ! and would either be 19 and 17, ; or 23 and 21, when their reign ! ended.

Son of a Bitch One celebrity son won't be in the limelight long, but he's sure breaking hearts while the glare's still bright. Stuart North is the 16-year-old son o f Lieut. Col. Oliver \" Have a Nice D ay\" N orth (who, remember, is the charismatic born-again Christian the info- numbed media call \"dashing,\" and whose family station wagon sports a bumper sticker reading, \"God Is Pro-Lific\" ). A largish photo in the July 6 Ex showed Ollie bar-b-queing in his back yard \u2014 while the pro-lific Stuart looked on, expertly hoisting a Coke bottle to his pursed lips, revealing a technique it takes lesser men (and boys) years o f concentrated practice to master. His dad will land in jail, but it's clear Stuart will do his best work in front o f bars.

Not \" us\" ? Ron: please.) He recognizes, too, that \" the important thing to [politi\u00ad cians] is which side [they] sh o u ld .. .come out on to get [their] ass reelected.\" A p p e a rin g in a f ra n k , 30-minute educational film on AIDS, Ron apparently goes the extra nine yards, presenting a condom and spermicide. As I mentioned three weeks ago, this is good news; as Ron says in Peo\u00ad ple, \" Come on, goddamn it. How many people have to die before you get out and say some\u00ad thing?\" Voice of the Peephole The Village Voice has been churning out excellent gay- related copy: its June 30 \" State o f Emergency\" issue featured in\u00ad spired pieces by Richard Gold\u00ad stein on the State o f Gay, 1987; C. Carr on lesbians' admirable response to gay men's AIDS deaths; Barry Walters on the joys o f jerking off; and Michael Musto on the miseries o f macho. I highly recommend, too, Guy Trebay's July 7 Voice piece (not on newsstands here till next Monday) on New York's Laven-. der Light Black and People o f All Color Lesbian and Gay Gospel Choir. The story is a model o f positive reporting in which gays are seen as happy, productive, funny and loving, and That Damn Disease is only mentioned in the title o f an aid group to which one o f the chorus members belongs.This is a far cry from \" sen- sitiv e\" m ainstream new srag reports on gays \" courageously\" carrying on in the face o f AIDS, the kind that suggest, for in\u00ad stance, that the SF Gay Men's Chorus, besotted with AIDS deaths, is a microcosm for the gay community. Not enough \"straight\" news organs pay at\u00ad tention to the reg'lar oP livin' and lovin' that daily informs the lives o f our community's members.

Fie on Newsweek for its putrid and insensitive July 13 piece on bisexuals, which posited that the dual fun-seekers are the \" real\" threat in the AIDS spread.

A Mid-Year Report Digging for Buried Vinyl Believe it or not, the super-charged year of 1987 is already half over and so far it's been six months chock-full-o' fun, fear, hilarity and shock. A variety of notables have given their all to make the first half of '87 one of the rocking-est time spans in recent memory. Working alone and in pairs \u2014 aided by money, power, faith, and even weapons \u2014 certain diligent go-getters have pushed the most seminal and renegade qualities o f rock and roll back to the fore once again, and I'm not talking about U2. I'm talking about Jim and Tammy Bakkcr, the Pope, pit bulls that kill, Donna Rice, Colonel North, Fawn Hall, our nutty President, the red bag o f bones he calls \" M ommy,\" and George Bush. This group dishes up more sleaze and subversion than The New York Dolls ever did, but that's not all. The line-up boasts two sluts a-'dancin', a Polish guy in a dress whose \" Serious In\u00ad cense Tour\" has packed stadi\u00ad ums worldwide, a bespectacled guy on tambourine and insults, an anorexic minimalist poet best known for her three-word epic, \" Just Say N o,\" a non-talkative m ilita ry u n ifo rm q u e e n (rumored to be an ex-Village Person), and a palsied ex-actor whose finest moment in film (slapping Angie D ickinson around) enabled him to truly act and teach that Kennedy-lovin' starlet a lesson at the same time. Finally, oozing tears and white trash charisma, G od's favorite couple fronts the band. Originally chosen solely on the basis o f Tammy's extreme rock and roll fashion sense and Jim 's rumored bisexuality a la Elton, Mick and David, this pair of em otional livewires actually carry the entire outfit. They have a huge following \u2014 all the K-Mart rhinestones good Chris\u00ad tian money can buy \u2014 and truly divine connections.

C o n tin u e d fro m p a g e 22 distributors also are unreceptive to gay and lesbian films, despite the success o f Desert Hearts. Also, she cautioned, filmmakers have to be careful not to be ex\u00ad ploited by distribution deals. \" The eager lesbian public clamoring for films about les\u00ad bian lives needs to be reminded,\" Zimmerman said, \" that without us and our money we will not be able to make films on our own terms, but will have only male- produced and financed films.\" Von G ro te reiterated this: without support from the com\u00ad munity, she fears no one will be doing lesbian movies in a couple of years \u2014 \" I can feel it rolling backwards.\" The forum made it clear that more o f this kind o f dialogue is needed. Audiences, even lesbian audiences, need to be remindedthat movies don't just magically appear in the theater, but are produced at great expense. It took twelve years to make Desert Hearts. In order for the diversity of lesbian voices and concerns expressed in the forum to be reflected on the screen, we need to recognize the size o f the battle ahead. As cultural warriors, we need both strategic and material support from our community, friends and colleagues. C o n tin u e d fro m p a g e 24 I'm angry at my own lack o f self- assertion and general lack of clarity. Why does Don, who seem s o th erw ise sensitive, choose to associate with some\u00ad one like Norman? On the other hand, do we not learn best from our own mistakes?That Jerry Falwell, Jim and T am m y B ak k er, o r E lio tt Abrams flaunt their sleazy and exploitative personalities on TV doesn't much concern me. I don't have to talk to them and can blip off the set at will. W hat's irritating is having to fend off such people in real life. W hat's painful is seeing one's friends come under such influences. W hat's confusing is wondering what part I myself have played in creating and getting drawn into such messes. Respect is not a right like free\u00ad dom or a gift like love. It's some\u00ad thing that must be earned on the basis o f one's behavior and ac\u00ad complishments. The path o f vir\u00ad tue is often lonely and nothing's so difficult as working on one\u00ad self. Would Socrates himself have produced had he not a host of beautiful boys to applaud and m u rm u r, \" V ery tru e , Socrates\" ? C o n tin u e d from p a g e 25 allure \u2014 and the cliched tragedy that created their legendary status. Melamed strikes a fine bal\u00ad ance with the elements he works with. His drawings, however, work better conceptually than artistically. The choice o f medium seems somewhat inter\u00ad changeable. While Melamed chooses to draw his images to add a human element, they could be equally as effective as photographs. The work pushes forward in the image/text tradition o f Jen\u00ad ny Holzer and Barbara Kruger. By placing language in his own context \u2014 in opposition to the image \u2014 Melamed begins to ex\u00ad plore new approaches to this type of work. While it is not clear where this exploration will lead, Summ er o f Love succeeds as anappealing artistic and sociologi\u00ad cal statement.

It Is absolutely possible to continue having great sex! WHO IS AT RISK OF AIDS? Guidelines for safer sex should be followed by everyone. Anyone who Is sexually active Is at risk of exposure to the AIDS virus. The only exception Is the couple who has been In an ex\u00ad clusively monogamous sexual rela\u00ad tionship since 1978. To date, gay and bisexual men, IV drug users, and their sexual partners, have been most often affected by the disease. Because many perople already carry the AIDS virus (especially In SF. NYC and other major urban areas), reducing the number of different sex\u00ad ual partners does not guarantee safe\u00ad ty from exposure. All It takes Is one In\u00ad fectious partner for exposure. But even If one has been exposed It Is thought to be Important to avoid repeated exposure to the virus.. Risk reduction practices must always be followed In every sexual en\u00ad counter. Have all the sax yon want \u2014 Jus* be aura to always Make It safer. AIDS IS TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE EXCHANGE OF CERTAIN BODY FLUIDS - YOU CANNOT GET AIDS FROM CASUAL CONTACT (hugging, kissing, sharing bathrooms and kit\u00ad chens.) and \u2014 In oral sex . . .avoid putting the head of the penis Into your mouth. \u2014 In anal sex . always use a condom, w ith water soluble lubricants such as KY?

If you do It, always use a rubber glove. \u2014 If you In je c t d ru g s , n e ve r share needles, cookers, or other drug paraphfenalla. \u2014If you are bisexual, avoid contact w ith menstrual flow. Use a con\u00ad dom. \u2014What about saliva? The virus has been Isolated In saliva, though rarely and In very low concentration. The exchange of saliva Is generally thought not to be a risk for AIDS. \u2014W hat about arlaa and feces? A lth o u g h th e v iru s c o u ld theoretically be present In any body secretion, urine, feces, sweat and tears are not known to be modes of transmission. Oral contact w ith fecal material (rim\u00ad ming) should be avoided to reduce the risk of other sexually trans\u00ad m itted diseases. One should use a condom, finger co t or rubber glove If giving a rectal massage. Avoid oral contact w ith fingers after this. \u2014Alcohol and ira g s may Impair your Judgment and may com\u00ad promise your Immune system. \u2014Peppers (Inhalants) have been linked to Kaposi's sarcofoa, a cancer associated w ith AIDS. DON'T USE POPPERS. Ultimately, practicing safer sex Is a personal choice. These guidelines will help to give you enough Informa\u00ad tion to make responsible choices. M utual m asterbatlon, hugging, frottag e (body rubbing), cuddling, showering together and massaging do not involve the exchange o f body fluids, and therefore are considered safe.

(CP28) C o n tin u e d on n e x t p ag e ON THE COUCH JOHN ARMSTRONG I Saw How You Looked at Him! c Jealousy in all its many forms and m anifestations is right up there with money as a chief cau se of relational discord. Whether you and your mate have decided to have an ex\u00ad clusive or open relationship, you will still find yourself strug\u00ad gling with jealo u s feelings. -Either you or he, and more prob\u00ad ably both of you will find your\u00ad selves acting jealously. Now if you and your lover have an ex\u00ad clusive relationship, and you have reason to believe he's stepping out on you, you have every reason to be jealous. And to feel seriously betrayed. But how about the c ase of the rov\u00ad ing eye? The c ase where the two of you are out together and you notice that your sweetie is checking out this other guy. The natural impulse is to snap, \"I saw how you looked at him. I know what you're thinking.\" And you know what? He pro!* ably was indeed thinking dirty thoughts about the man you caught him checking out. I'm afraid that's Just human nature. Love may be blind, but It certainly does not blind us tothe obvious attractions of other men. Even seen the T-shirt, \"Married but not dead\"? Sexual desire is non-specific. If a man is horny, he's going to notice all the attractive men he's around. If he's not turned on, nobody can get to him, not even the man he loves. It's an on or off switch, not one that can be set for a specific guy. Every now and then I get a couple in my office where one guy is accusing his partner of being some kind of slut be\u00ad cause, and only because, he looks a lot. The usual request is that I somehow make his mate into a tiger in bed with him and totally uninterested in other guys. Sadly, th at's not how men work. We like to look, to fantasize, to appreciate male beauty. That doesn't mean we necessarily act on it. One of my favorite things to do is go out to some setting where there are lots of hot men and enjoy the view. It really gets my juices going to look, but then what I really want to do is knock one off with my lover. Inspiration, if you will, Wehave been known to make a gam e out of it. To point out each other's types to each other. Rate the men we see. Compare notes. The point is that looking doesn't have to threaten your relationship, even if you are sex\u00ad ually exclusive. Looking is fun, and hurts no one. You can evenm ake it something to share. And sadly, if you try to forbid it, the passion slowly goes out of your relationship. If a person is sy stem atically disco u rag ed from feeling sexual, sooner or later, he won't anymore. He won't lust after men on the street, but then, he won't lust after you either.Some men feel extraordinari\u00ad ly theatened when their mate adm ires another man. That strikes me as an expression of sexual insecurity. If that is true of you, perhaps you might ask for a little reassurance. If your partner says, \"Look at that guy over there. Isn't he just to die for?\" and it cuts through you like a knife, you might try ask\u00ad ing, \"More than me?\" It's safe to assum e you'll get an \"Of course not, silly.\" After all, if your lover didn't think you were hot, why would he be with you? But som etim es it's nice to hear it said. Especially when you and he are in a room full of hot men and he's looking like crazy at all the other guys. So go ahead and ask for the reassurance you need, but let him look. I promise you that you won't regret having let him charge his batteries once you get him home.
