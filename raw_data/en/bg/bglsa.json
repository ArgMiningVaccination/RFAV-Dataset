PHILOSOPHY OF NATURECURE Philosophy of Nature Cure is explained as following Basic theory of Nature Cure: 1. UNITY OF DISEASE, UNITY OF CURE (Dr.Louis Kuhne) 2. FOREIGN MATTER THEORY ( Dr.J.H. Tilden) 4. PANCHAMAHABHUTAS UNITY OF DISEASE & UNITY OF CURE By Dr. Louis Kuhne Primary cause of disease (violation of Natures Laws.) 1. Wrong food habit 2. Wrong thinking 3. Wrong living Primary life requirement of the cell Primary manifestation of the disease INNERVATION LOWERED VITALITY Unity of treatment (Natural methods of Treatment) 1.Return to nature1. 2 . NUTRITION IMPAIRED ABNORMAL COMPOSITION OF BLOOD & LYMPH 2. Economy of vital force 3. DRAINAGE ACCUMULATION OF MORBID MATTER WHICH OBSTRUCTS VENOUS & LYMPH 3. Elimination SECONDARY MANIFESTATION OF DISEASE SECONDARY CAUSE Fever inflammatio n Skin eruption Chronic sinus ulcers abscesses germs Mechanical subluxation hereditary Chronic poisoning FOREIGN MATTER THEORY Dr. Louis Kuhne Foreign matter are those substance which enter the body through various routes and that are generated inside the body due to faulty habits, improper digestion and improper elimination of morbid end products. These are unabsorbed, uneliminated & unassimilated inside the organ & organ system and hamper the function of the particular system. Example: (Clinical corelation of Foreign Matter Theory)- GOUT (Deposition of Uric Acid) Diabetes Mellitus (increase in blood sugar level) Jaundice (Increase in bilirubin level) Hypercholesterolaemia (increase cholesterol level in blood) Constipation ( accumulation of waste matter) Hay fever ( due to pollen grain) Sinusitis ( accumulation of fluid) TOXEMIA THEORY Dr. J. H. Tilden Toxemia is a condition in which the blood contains toxins produced by the body cells, at a local source of infection or derived from the growth of microorganism, it is also known as blood poisoning. CAUSE OF TOXEMIA: 1. Wrong lifestyle 2. Wrong eating habits 3. Wrong thinking Disease is a crisis of toxaemia; which means that toxin has accumulated in the blood above the toleration point. It could be cold, flu, pneumonia, headache or typhoid ( which is a vigorous elimination)NOTE: If the metabolic end product exceeds their level it results in toxaemi CURE : ACCORDING TO TOXEMIA THEORY Toxaemia philosophy founded that there is no such things as complete cure. All acute disease will get well if patient will practice self control concerning the enervation habits that brought the crisis of toxaemia. The patient should be educated about proper living habits so as to avoid further crisis of toxaemia. BIOCHEMICAL/ health S.NO. MAHABHUT QUALITY LOCATION VARIATION TREATMENT 1.
