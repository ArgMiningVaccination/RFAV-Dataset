THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 1999 HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES , COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMENT REFORM , Washington, DC. The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:06 a.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Dan Burton (chairmanof the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Burton, Davis, Horn, Ros-Lehtinen, Morella, Gilman, Moll, Barbara chief counsel; David A. director of John Carla J. Martin, chiefclerk; Smith-Arafune, deputy chief clerk; Tamburri,staff Jean Green, minority staff as-sistants. Mr. B URTON . Good morning. A quorum being present, the Com- mittee on Government Reform will come to order. I ask unanimous consent that all Members ' and witnesses ' writ- ten opening statements be included in the record. And, without ob-jection, so ordered. Today we are here to talk about the implementation of the Die- tary Supplement Health and Education Act [DSHEA], by the Foodand Drug Administration. At our hearing in February, we heardfrom the delightful actress Jane Seymour about her use of com-plementary and alternative medicine, including herbal productsand other dietary supplements to maintain good health for herselfand her family. At that hearing, we also heard from Dr. Brian Berman of the University of Maryland about the importance of research in dietarysupplements, such as glucosamine, to help Americans with arthri-tis and gingko biloba in delaying the onset of Alzheimer 's disease. The potential cost savings to the Federal Government in these twodebilitating illnesses is enormous and certainly justifies more re-search funding. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 10 hearings on chelation therapy, we learned from a panel of expert physicians that dietary supplements is used inconjunction with chelation therapy to improve circulation and car-diovascular health. In studying various alternative systems of heal-ing, whether it 's Ayurveda, Native American healing, or traditional Chinese medicine, two currents run through each of these systems:the importance of spirituality in healing and the important role ofbotanical products and nutrition in healing. The Food and Drug Administration does a very good job of pro- tecting the public. We are pleased that the new FDA Commissioneris joining us today to discuss the improvements she is making toassure that the FDA continues to protect the public and facilitatepatients ' access to clinical trials. Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act in 1994. The American people demanded to be heard on thisissue and Congress listened to them. More letters and faxes werereceived on this topic than any other single piece of legislation inU.S. history. Over 50 percent of Americans use dietary supplements on a reg- ular basis to improve their health. I personally began using supple-ments after a telephone conversation with Nobel Prize-winning sci-entist Linus Pauling, who told me that high doses of vitamin Cwould help prevent cancer and other diseases. Every Member of Congress is pulled in many directions at once every day. We work long, exhausting hours under great deals ofstress. I was delighted to learn in our February hearing from mycolleague on the committee, Helen Chenoweth, that she has suc-cessfully used the dietary supplement zinc in the treatment of arare disorder Meniere 's disease. It has helped her stay healthy and prevent brain surgery. I think that the Office of Dietary Supple-ments and the Office of Rare Diseases at the National Institutesof Health need to work together to determine where dietary supple-ments can be helpful in the treatment of rare diseases and dis-orders and to make this information known to the public. When Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Edu- cation Act, it was made very clear that Americans would have ac-cess to these products and that information was a key factor. Qual-ity, accurate, useful information on the labels, in the labeling, andin third-party literature is vital to Americans ' needs to make in- formed, safe choices. This is the cornerstone of this first hearing ondietary supplements. The committee has been in frequent contact with the FDA on a variety of concerns about proposed rulemaking, as well as the ac-tions of the FDA on a variety of topics in this area. It is particu-larly timely that we begin this discussion now as there is a newCommissioner of Food and Drugs, Dr. Jane Henney, who will tes-tify this morning. There are several issues of concern in this area. We cannot address each of the topics regarding dietary supple- ments in depth today. However, they do warrant mentioning: nutri-tional labeling, good manufacturing practices, the Dietary Supple-ment Commission on labeling, the structure function statementand the redefinition of disease, the authoritative statement health VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May events reporting, ephedra, Stevia, and CODEX. And we have an attach-ment to the statement which I would like to enter into the recordas well. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate We have heard interviews in the media from FDA officials that, since the passage of the Dietary Supplement Healthand Education Act, FDA has no authority to regulate dietary sup-plements. This is not a factual statement. In fact, the FDA has sev-eral specific authorities that are listed on the poster and I thinkwe have that poster someplace. Do you want to put that up there?Those who are interested can take a closer look at that. I 'm sorry the print is a little bit small. Do we have a handout? Mr. Wax-man's asked for one, so if we could get that, we would like to have it. As for the safety of supplements, an interesting comparison was published last year; 106,000 people die a year from prescriptiondrugs; 42,000 a year from automobile accidents. It is more likelythat you will be struck by lightning and die in this country thanit is that you will die from using a dietary supplement, with just16 deaths reported from that last year. We wish to continue towork with the FDA to assure that these numbers do not increase.Research to learn more about drug interactions will help, as wellas a better reporting system. The primary focus of today 's hearing with the FDA will be the proposed rule on structure function statements. The Dietary Sup-plement Health and Education Act was explicit in allowing formanufacturers to include information on labels regarding the bene-fits of a supplement on the structure or the function of the body,while specifically not allowing for disease claims to be made. Theproposed rule does not comply with the legislation. Instead, thisproposed rule would supersede legislation passed by the Congressand be in direct opposition to the will of Congress and the Amer-ican people. We are delighted today to hear from Miss Raquel Welch, who will be with us shortly. She is a lovely lady who has entertainedus in her many movie and stage performances. And she will sharewith us how she uses dietary supplements to maintain good health.And I just found out a few minutes ago that she is one of your con-stituents, Mr. Waxman. It 's kind of nice to know you have one of the most beautiful women in the world in your district, don 't you think? [Laughter.] We will also hear today from Scott Bass. I don 't know how beau- tiful Scott is. Where are you Scott? [Laughter.] He is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and an at- torney with the law firm of Sidley and Austin. Mr. Bass is a legalexpert on dietary supplements and will outline for us the historyof dietary supplement legislation and the effect of proposed struc-ture function regulations. We will also hear from Daniel Kracov of Patton Boggs, regarding one of the laws involved in the Cholestin case. I think that was justresolved recently. He will share with us information aboutPharmanex 's interactions with FDA and the legal case. There is an increasing amount of research being published on the benefits of dietary supplements. A week does not go by that thepress does not report on the benefits of some of these supplements.Dr. Edward Croom of the University of Mississippi will discuss therole and the level of research in botanicals, as well as outline theneed for further research. Dr. Croom has been called an advisor to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 agencies as well as international organizations such as the World Health Organization. We will also be hearing from three members of the Dietary Sup- plement Commission on Labeling. Robert McCaleb, president of theHerb Research Foundation; Dr. Annette Dickinson, from the Coun-cil for Responsible Nutrition; and Margaret Gilhooley, of Seton HallLaw School. We will also hear from Attorney James Turner, chairperson of Citizens for Health, a consumer advocate organization. In additionto dietary supplement issues, Mr. Turner worked with the FDA onreclassification of acupuncture needles. I am pleased that my colleagues in the Senate, Senators Tom Harkin and Orrin Hatch, have been supportive of our efforts to re-solve these issues. I think we have a couple of staff people fromSenator Hatch 's office with us today. Both Senator Harkin and Senator Hatch were instrumental in passing the Dietary Supple-ment Health and Education Act in 1994. Additionally, colleagueshere in the House, Congressman Dennis Kucinich, who is on ourcommittee, and Peter DeFazio have worked diligently to ensurethat Americans have health freedom. We have shown that good health is not a partisan issue. We have shown on this committee that there is interest in assuring thatAmericans have the right to make their own health care choicesand have access to an integrated system of healing on both sidesof the aisle. And, toward that end, we will hold the record openuntil April 8 to allow written submissions for the record from mem-bers of the committee. I now recognize my colleague, Mr. Waxman, for his opening statement. [The prepared statement of Hon. Dan Burton follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 you very much, Mr. Chairman. I have a number of remarks I want to make about the topic of dietary sup-plements. But, before I do, I want to welcome FDA CommissionerHenney. Commissioner Henney was sworn in only a few months ago and I understand this is the first time she has appeared before ourcommittee. As her written testimony indicates, she has identifiedfive priorities for FDA, including enhancing the agency 's science base, protecting the Nation 's food and blood supply, and reducing teen smoking. These are essential priorities for improving and pro-tecting the health of the American people. It is crucial that we inCongress work with Commissioner Henney in achieving these pri-orities. Today 's hearing addresses an issue that I have been involved in for years, dietary supplements. Five years ago, I worked with Sen-ator Hatch and my colleagues on the Commerce Committee incrafting the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994.Since I was intimately involved in the negotiations that producedthe legislation, I think I am in a good position to address the topicof this hearing, the ''Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act: Is FDA trying to change the intent of Congress? '' It is clear to me that the FDA is doing a good job implementing a complex, challenging, and sometimes deliberately ambiguous law.The law we enacted in 1994 was a series of compromises. DSHEAallowed makers of supplements to market their products withouthaving to demonstrate that they are safe or effective, but, at thetime, it authorized FDA to remove products that are later provento be dangerous from the market. It allowed manufacturers toclaim that dietary supplements will benefit the structure or func-tion of the body but, at the same time, it prohibited manufacturersfrom making unproven claims that supplements will cure diseases.Our hope was that the law would balance the goal of providing con-sumers with wide access to dietary supplements and the goal ofprotecting consumers from dangerous or ineffective products. Today we will hear arguments that Congress did not intend for the FDA to have an active role in protecting the consumer fromdangerous products being sold as dietary supplements. We will alsohear that FDA 's recent efforts to protect the consumer are inappro- priate and heavy-handed intervention. This is simply erroneous.When we passed DSHEA, we knew that many dietary supple-ments, such as minerals and vitamins, can play an important rolein promoting health. But we also knew that, without proper regula-tion, dietary supplements can sometimes be lethal. We knew that L-tryptophan, a product that was marketed in the 1980 's as a sleep aid, was linked to EMS, a painful, debilitating, and sometimes fatal disease. At least 1,500 people were struck withthis disease and at least 38 people died from it before FDA issuedregulations banning L-tryptophan. Events since enactment of DSHEA have confirmed the need for an active FDA. Sometimes it seems that there is a new articleabout the dangers of dietary supplements every month. For exam-ple, in 1997, the Washington Post reported about the danger of Na-ture's Nutrition Formula One, which contained a dietary supple- ment called ephedra. Products like Nature 's Nutrition Formula VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 containing ephedra like herbal ecstasy and herbal fen-phen are marketed for weight loss, energy boost, andnatural high. But, in fact, according to the Washington Post, theseproducts have been linked to at least 38 deaths. FDA also receivedhundreds of reports of other adverse events associated with prod-ucts containing ephedra. These adverse events included increasedblood pressure, chest pains, insomnia, heart attack, stroke, psy-chosis, and seizure. More recently, in March 1998, FDA warned consumers against Sleeping Buddha, a product being marketed as a dietary supple-ment, but which actually contains a prescription-strength drug in-gredient, Estazolam, which is known to have serious side effects,including potential damage to a fetus if consumed by a pregnantwoman. Earlier this year, FDA issued a warning against dietarysupplements containing GBL, a substance marketed as a perform-ance enhancer. When GBL is taken orally, it is converted in thebody to GHB, a potent and unapproved drug. GBL has been associ-ated with at least 55 incidents of adverse health affects, includingseizures, vomiting, comas, and death. Five of the reported victimswere children under 18 years of age. These are not the only products that have caused problems. For example, certain teas with plant-derived laxatives have been asso-ciated with the deaths of four young women. And, as CommissionerHenney states in her testimony, which we had an opportunity toread in advance, some dietary supplements containing the ingre-dient plantain were actually contaminated with digitalis, a power-ful stimulant which can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, head-ache, confusion, low blood pressure, vision trouble, and abnormalheart rate and heart rhythm. I don 't recite these examples in order to alarm the public or criti- cize the dietary supplement industry. There are many importantand effective dietary supplements on the market. But the purposeof DSHEA was to make these products available and to ease thefears that many people had that the products would be removedfrom the market or they would have to go to the doctor to get aprescription simply to get a vitamin. We made clear that weweren 't going to permit that sort of practice. No one disputes the importance of products such as calcium in maintaining healthybones or the link between folic acid and the prevention of certainbirth defects. Consumers need to learn about these products. My point is that we need an active and vigilant FDA to help us weed out the dangerous dietary supplements and identify the safeand effective ones. The answer isn 't to attack FDA every time the agency takes even baby steps toward regulating dietary supple-ments. The answer isn 't to criticize the agency for failing to adhere to the intent of Congress when, in fact, the agency is trying its bestto implement a complex and ambiguous law. Instead, the answeris to establish a regulatory framework for dietary supplements atFDA that appropriately balances the interests of consumer accessand public health. This position is supported by a variety of con-sumer groups, including the American Dietetic Association, which VerDate 11-MAY-2000 70,000 food and nutrition professionals. And I would like, Mr. Chairman, to ask that the statement of the Amer-ican Dietetic Association be entered into the record. Mr. B URTON . Without objection. [The prepared statement of the American follows:] VerDate learned one thing about dietary supple- ments over the years. It is that we also need to reduce the mistrustand polarization that has surrounded this issue for far too long. Idon't think it is in the interests of those who support dietary sup- plements to have products on the market that harm people becausethen the public will be distrustful of all dietary supplements. Idon't think it is helpful for the American people to allow products to be marketed with claims that are made for which there is nosubstantiation and no validity. This is going to lead to cynicismand distrust. I believe that Commissioner Henney understands this and I look forward to hearing her ideas and those of the other witnesses aboutdietary supplements. I am pleased to welcome Raquel Welch, whois one of my constituents, and all the other witnesses that we havescheduled for today. This is an issue that engenders a lot of inter-est because there is nothing more important than trying to protectthe health of the American people. Mr. B URTON . I understand that Dr. Henney is under time con- straints. If any Members would like to make a brief opening state-ment, we will allow it, but, otherwise, we will just have them sub-mitted for the record. With that, Dr. Henney, would you like tocome forward? Mrs. Chenoweth, would you like to have your statement sub- mitted for the record? Without objection, so ordered. [The prepared statements of Hon. Helen Chenoweth, Hon. Ben- jamin will do it for everyone, yes. Dr. Henney, would you like to come forward? You can still stand. We normally swear in our witnesses. [Witness sworn.]Mr. B URTON . Welcome, Dr. Henney, and congratulations on your new appointment. We are anxious to hear what you have to say,so you are recognized to make an opening statement. STATEMENTS OF JANE HENNEY, COMMISSIONER, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, ACCOMPANIED BY JOE LEVITT, DI-RECTOR, CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY AND APPLIED NUTRI- TION, AND MARGARET PORTER, CHIEF COUNSEL Dr. H ENNEY . Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, my name is Dr. Jane Henney. I am accompanied this morning by Dr.Joe Levitt, who is the Director of the FDA Center for Food Safetyand Applied Nutrition, and Margaret Porter, our Chief Counsel. Iam honored to address you, as the Commissioner of Food andDrugs, and pleased to be here today to discuss the implementationof the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994. Because this is my first appearance before this committee as Commissioner, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly sharemy priorities for the FDA. I hope that they will provide a contextfor our dialog today and in the future. My first priority is the fulland effective implementation of the FDA Modernization Act. I in-tend to build on this collaborative, constructive model by workingclosely with the Congress, the regulated industry, patients, con-sumers, and health professionals. My second priority is enhancing the agency 's science base. To meet our statutory obligation to regulate cutting edge scientific dis-covery and development, we must have cutting edge expertise inour staff. We must also harness the scientific expertise of thoseoutside the agency. My remaining three priorities are also those of the administra- tion, the safety of our food supply, the safety of our blood supply,and reducing tobacco use by young people. Beyond these priorities, the agency must use its finite resources wisely. We must focus on those areas that maximize public healthpromotion and protection. And this is the perspective with whichwe approach implementation of the Dietary Supplements Act of1994. I know that this statute was passed with broad, bipartisan sup- port. I know that you and others in Congress worked hard to de-velop an appropriate statutory scheme that would facilitate con-sumers ' access to dietary supplements, as well as to provide FDA with the authority to remove products from the market if theypresent a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Iknow that many Americans place great faith in dietary supple-ments to maintain and improve their health. And I know that thescientific evidence documenting the benefits of a number of supple-ments is increasing. With these facts in mind, I want to assure you that, as the new Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, I am focusingattention on dietary supplements. Last month, FDA 's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition published a 1999 program prior- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 document includes on its A list for completion an overall dietary supplements strategy by the end of the year. Iam committed to developing a comprehensive strategy for effectiveregulation of dietary supplements. And in so doing, to reach out tothose affected by our regulation and to listen receptively to theirviews. I am equally committed to ensuring that FDA 's implementation of the statute is true to congressional intent. Congress has givena challenge to the FDA under this statute to strike the right bal-ance between preserving consumer access to potentially health-im-proving supplements, while assuring the safety and proper labelingof these products. I think it is clear that the agency still has a wayto go both in developing a workable regulatory framework and inachieving full implementation of the Dietary Supplement Act of1994. I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge our progress, shortcomings, and remaining challenges. Let me first note that thedietary supplement marketplace has changed significantly sincethe passage of the act. The dietary supplement industry itself hasgrown exponentially. So have the number of Americans buyingthese products. Surveys show that more than half of the U.S. adultpopulation now uses dietary supplements, spending upwards of $12billion per year on these products. Access to dietary supplements also has changed. In the past, with the exception of vitamin and mineral products, dietary supple-ments were available primarily in health food stores. Dietary sup-plements were marketed principally to adults. Now a wide rangeof dietary supplements are available in supermarkets and via theInternet. This makes dietary supplements readily available to chil-dren and adolescents, as well as to adults. Many of these changes would appear to be consistent with the intent of the Dietary Supplements Act of 1994. However, a rapidlyexpanding industry and a changing demographic mix of consumerseager to manage their own health care present significant regu-latory challenges, many of which were not foreseen at the time theact was passed. Let me turn to FDA 's progress to date in implementing the Die- tary Supplements Act of 1994. Initially, the agency concentrated onpublishing the many regulations mandated by the statute. Theagency also began a number of other regulatory actions to establishthe framework for implementation of the new law. Since the passage of the statute, FDA has published 25 Federal Register notices regarding dietary supplements. These notices,which are described in more detail in my written testimony, in-clude a final rule requiring that all dietary supplement labels carrynutrition information in a box, entitled ''supplement facts, '' which became effective just this week; an advance notice of proposed rule-making on good manufacturing practice that would assure purityand consistency for dietary supplements; and a proposed rule topermit health claims on dietary supplements, based on authori-tative statements. Notwithstanding these actions, I want to acknowledge that FDA has a long way to go to achieve full implementation of the DietarySupplement Act of 1994. I mentioned earlier that the agency in- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May issue an overall strategy for regulation of die- tary supplements. The strategy will address all of the elements ofan effective dietary supplement program, including defining theboundaries between dietary supplements and conventional foodsand between dietary supplements and drugs; claims made for die-tary supplements; good manufacturing practice or GMP regula-tions; adverse event reporting, review, and followup; laboratory ca-pabilities; research needs; enforcement; and, finally, resourceneeds. I would like to note here that, while the agency may not have moved quickly on this in the past, we are committed to acceleratingthe development and implementation of GMP regulations. FDAalso is committed to quickly addressing safety problems that arisewith dietary supplements. Several important regulatory challenges lie ahead for FDA in fully implementing the Dietary Supplement Act of 1994. We mustdelineate some difficult boundaries between dietary supplementsand conventional foods; and between dietary supplements anddrugs; and between dietary supplements and cosmetics. We mustclarify what types of claims may be made for dietary supplements.And we must be sure we are able to use efficiently the tools Con-gress provided to us to protect consumers from unsafe products. Mr. Chairman, we share the goal of making safe dietary supple- ment products available to consumers who want to make informedpersonal choices to improve their health. The Dietary SupplementAct of 1994 was enacted to ensure access to those products. I alsobelieve the act provides FDA with the necessary legal authority toprotect the public health. We will do our best to marshall the sci-entific information and expertise necessary to exercise that author-ity when the public health is threatened. The dietary supplement industry sells products on which millions of Americans rely. I am aware that in the past, the relationship be-tween FDA and some in the industry has been, at times, antago-nistic and counterproductive. I am committed to developing a posi-tive relationship with the industry so that we may, together, meetour shared goal of providing safe products to the American public.The statute is still in its early stages of implementation and I lookforward to working with Congress and other interested parties toensure that resource constraints or other issues do not impedeFDA 's ability to use this statutory authority most effectively. And I will be happy to respond to any questions the committee mayhave. [The prepared statement of Dr. you very much, Dr. Henney. And I want to apologize for not recognizing Ms. Porter and Dr. Levitt when youfirst came up. So welcome to both of you, as well. First of all, I would like to congratulate you on bringing to the consumer the supplements facts statement. I think you sent it tous a couple of days ago. This is a good move for the agency towardgetting very accurate and good information to the public. I reallyappreciate that. Under your direction, the FDA seems to be doinga much better job with the problem products that we have had todeal with in the past. And I think that is a good signal to Membersof Congress. So congratulations on a good start. First of all, let me ask you about the proposed rule on the struc- ture function statements. There is some question about what theFDA and what you are going to do with that. Could you comment? Dr. H ENNEY . Mr. Chairman, let me describe what the agency has done thus far. As you know, the agency did issue a proposed rulein that area. It is fair to say that this is a matter of great interestbecause we have received over 100,000 comments that have com-mented on many aspects of that proposed rule, all of which we areobligated to take into account before we move to final rule stage. I would say that most of the concerns sort of center around the issue of the disease definition used by the agency that relied veryheavily on reference books from medical dictionaries and the like.I think that we still have a ways to go in our evaluation of all com-ments on the particular definition that we have selected andwhether it was too broad or not. So we will be working diligentlyon coming to closure on that rule before we would issue it in final. Mr. B URTON . Well, there is some concern among some Members of Congress and many in the public sector, that the law, which waspassed in 1994, 1995 would be circumvented by that regulation.And I presume that you are going to take a hard look at the com-pliance with the current statute. Dr. H ENNEY . I think, Mr. Chairman, it is fair to say that it is very important that we settle on this key issue of definition of dis-ease because it is that definition that will also guide that criticalissue of boundary for a dietary supplement and what happens inthe drug arena. So we realize the interest and we will want to dealwith this quite thoughtfully and deliberately. Mr. B URTON . Do you think that the FDA has enough authority right now to deal with dietary supplements? Dr. H ENNEY . Mr. Chairman, I believe, as outlined in the act, ap- propriate authority is either given to the agency within the contextof the Dietary Supplement Act or in the law that it is embodied inthe basic FDA act as well. However, I would say that we are veryearly into the implementation of this new law. We believe that wehave the appropriate authorities that we need. But please be as-sured that if we do not and find ourselves in a situation where wedo not have adequate authority to protect the public health, we willbring it to your attention. Mr. B URTON . How many courtesy letters has the FDA sent out on the structure function statement? And what percentage is thatto the total number of statements that have been made? Dr. H ENNEY . Mr. Chairman, it is very good, as Commissioner, to have people who know more facts than I do after only 3 months. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May couldn 't agree with you more. You have got to have good help. Dr. H ENNEY . Good help is hard to find. But I am told that about 300. Mr. B URTON . About 300. Excuse me, what were the total number of statements, do you know? Dr. H ENNEY . This is about 10 percent or about 3,000 statements. Mr. B URTON . About 3,000. As a physician, can you really accept the definition of disease as the absence of a normal state? Dr. H ENNEY . Mr. Chairman, I am going to be compelled to look at this issue, both as a physician and Commissioner. I think that,as I indicated, the definition of disease that was drawn on in theproposed rule did come, in large part, from reference texts, so weare having to rely on a number of resources as look not only atwhat we did originally but at what others would like us to considernow. And I have not come to a conclusion in that matter yet. Mr. B URTON . Do you think that the FDA should create a sepa- rate advisory committee for dietary supplements rather than haveonly a subcommittee to the Foods Advisory Committee? Dr. H ENNEY . Mr. Chairman, the matter of having an advisory committee in one specific area of regulation is certainly somethingthat we could give consideration to. The Foods Advisory Committeeitself was established during the time that I was at the agency be-fore, when we felt that we needed more expertise and outside helpfrom a variety of sources to help us with the whole area of food.I believe that, as we move forward into developing our framework,our regulatory framework for the dietary supplements area, we willlikely be using a wide variety of means to garner information andexpertise from individuals outside the agency. Whether that willcall for the establishment of a permanent advisory committee, wehave not made any decision in that regard. I would cite one case in which we have done that in the past and it was, again, in an area that the agency was moving into, the over-the-counter products. And an advisory committee was establishedsimply for that area as a drug might move from the prescriptionarea to over-the-counter. So it is not without precedent that wemight do something like that. But please be assured, whether ornot we have a fixed and permanent advisory committee, both Mr.Levitt and I are very committed to seek the outside support, help,and expertise from many as we move forward. Mr. B URTON . Thank you very much. I will probably have a couple more questions in the second round. Mr. Waxman. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Henney, this may not be a good example. This is maybe more of a food product. ButI have a glass with some liquid in it. Let us say I wanted to bottlethis and sell it and tell people that, if they drink this, it will curecancer. Will FDA stop me? Dr. H ENNEY . Mr. Waxman, it would be a daunting challenge to stop you from anything. [Laughter.] However, since you would be making \u2014\u2014 Mr. W AXMAN . The chairman 's had some success. Dr. H ENNEY . Since you would clearly be making a disease claim, which is prohibited, yes, we would stop you. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May I sold this product and I didn 't make a disease claim but I made a claim that this could really help improve yourhealth, any problem with that? Dr. H ENNEY . We at the agency would likely have much less prob- lem with that because drinking water is known to help improve anindividual 's health. Mr. W AXMAN . When we drafted this legislation, there were some people who argued a manufacturer ought to be able to sell a prod-uct and make any claim that he wants to if he has some substan-tiation, but it doesn 't have to be a great deal. And let the market- place operate. On the other hand, other people felt, well, that is just too wide open. And we made a distinction in the law between diseaseclaims, claims that a product is intended to treat, prevent, miti-gate, cure, or diagnose a disease. And we said those products aredrugs and they ought to be reviewed by FDA to be sure they aresafe and effective. But if it is a product that simply is intended toaffect the structure or function of the body, we said that the manu-facturer can make claims in that regard. Now they have to be accu-rate, but you wouldn 't police the accuracy of those claims, as I un- derstand it. Dr. H ENNEY . Mr. Waxman, to the latter point, I think that there is a provision that, on the label there would have to be a disclaimerin that regard. The statement must be truthful and not misleading,as well. Mr. W AXMAN . Disclaimer, right. But the question that I wanted to ask you \u2014I may be not fully correct in that saying that if there is something so outlandish, even though it wasn 't a disease claim, you still may have peripheral authority. But, for all practical pur-poses, the intent of Congress was to allow some of these claims tobe made. What would happen if you allowed something to be mar-keted with disease claims and what dangers are there associatedwith marketing a product that makes a disease claim, without hav-ing demonstrated scientific substantiation for such claims? A lot ofpeople think that products ought to be out there. It will make itmore available to people. Give them information that is valuable.Why wouldn 't you think it would make sense to allow disease claims to be made? Dr. H ENNEY . Mr. Waxman, I think that there are at least two concerns in that regard. One is of concern to the consumer of hav-ing a claim, particularly in terms of the treatment of disease, thatwould be wrong or, at best, false and misleading and consumersacting on that information would clearly be misled. And so I thinkCongress struck a good balance in saying disease claims could notbe made. It also, I believe, is one of those areas where there is a defini- tional boundary in terms of making a drug claim, in terms of notinfringing upon a drug industry 's mode of working with the agency as well; where premarket approval clearly is rigorous, premarketapproval clearly is required. Mr. W AXMAN . Well, I think there is another reason also. If a manufacturer of a drug could just market it as a dietary supple-ment without having to go through all the research, he might startmarketing a product and we wouldn 't even fully know the impact VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 product because all the clinical tests might not be com- pleted. They can go out and market it and make a profit and noteven know whether there is going to be a full success or other prob-lems associated with that. The FDA has been criticized because the line between the struc- ture function claim and a disease claim is not always clear, but Idon't think that is your fault. The statute forces you to draw a dis- tinction between the two types of claims when, in fact, there maybe no clear distinction. What is your opinion on this? And could youalso answer this question: about if the court decision on Cholestinis not overturned, what problems do you see with that decision inthe context of our discussion? Dr. H ENNEY . Mr. Waxman, to the point of structure function, it is critical that we get this issue correct. The boundary for a dietarysupplement and drug or dietary supplement and health claims orfood claims is equally important. I think to the specific issue ofCholestin, the issue is not so much about the claim, but whetherthe product in question is really not the original food of red yeastrice but has been converted through a manufacturing process to theactive ingredient of a drug. Mr. W AXMAN . Well, if you have a product that then competes with a drug because it has the same active ingredient yet it doesn 't go through the clinical tests and you don 't know about the whole manufacturing process, is there a concern that you have aboutthat? Dr. H ENNEY . Then there is, essentially, no protection for those drug manufacturers who invest and go through all of the rigors ofthat clinical trial and meet the standard of new drug approval. Mr. W AXMAN . And maybe they won 't make that investment next time around. Mr. B URTON . Mrs. Chenoweth. Mrs. C HENOWETH . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Commissioner, welcome. Is it the overall objective of the FDA to support access todietary supplements or try to suppress out of concern for the pur-chaser? Dr. H ENNEY . Mrs. Chenoweth, I think that the agency is obli- gated to follow the law in this regard and the law very clearly wasintended to provide access to dietary supplements while chargingthe agency and giving the agency appropriate authority that, ifthese products were unsafe or presented unreasonable health risks,the agency could take action. It also clearly wanted to provide ac-cess to a product that was appropriately and properly labeled. Mrs. C HENOWETH . Wouldn 't the FDA want the population to have access to information that will help them to make educateddecisions about the products they use in terms of health claims asopposed to disease claims? I ask you this because there is evidencethat the FDA is deliberately suppressing information which couldhelp health consumers make an educated decision about productswhich could help them. The FDA limits what producers of healthsupplements may say about their products. For example, psyllium is widely known to be helpful in lowering cholesterol which is a health claim which is a contributing factorto heart disease. They make the distinction there. Now this is a nu-trient found in many commercial food products; Post and Kellogg VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 big companies use it on their products, like cereal and other whole grains. But the FDA has approved the health claim as-sociating consumption of psyllium in food with reduced risk ofheart disease. Producers will often print that information on the la-bels of their products so consumers can make an educated choice. But that isn 't true for psyllium sold off the shelf as a dietary sup- plement. In fact, if producers of psyllium as a dietary supplementwanted to educate consumers about the benefits of psyllium \u2014that is the health decisions, the health choice \u2014the FDA would prevent it. And this is precisely the issue at stake in the case that you justappealed to the Supreme Court involving Pearson and Shalala, thedifference between a claim and a disease claim. And then the second part of my question, of course, is why can Post and Kellogg 's and the big companies get by with that, making those claims, those health claims, while the small individual nutri-tion stores may not? Dr. H ENNEY . Mrs. Chenoweth, let me respond to you in terms of the issue of health claims. You raise many specific items during thecourse of your question and I would like the opportunity to teasethose apart and get back to you if I could, explicitly, for the record. [The information referred to follows:] FDA authorizes health claims for use in food labeling under provisions of the Nu- trition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 and established requirements at 21 CFR101.14. FDA has authorized use of a health claim for the relationship between solu-ble fiber from certain foods, including psyllium, and a reduced risk of coronary heartdisease (21 CFR 101.81). Consequently, any food, including a dietary supplementthat meets the eligibility criteria in FDA 's regulations at 21 CFR 101.14 and 21 CFR 101.81 may bear that claim in its label or labeling. The Agency is aware thatthere are products marketed as dietary supplements that bear a claim about the re-lationship between psyllium and coronary heart disease. Dr. H ENNEY . I think to the matter of health claims, be they for a food or a drug, if they relate specifically to a disease, they gothrough a different kind of process or a preauthorization processthan those that relate to the structure and function of the body, ondietary supplements. With respect to psyllium, FDA has approveda health claim for this and its relationship to coronary heart dis-ease, but I will be more than glad to look into other applicationswe might have in hand with respect to that particular product andsee if there is anything else, in-house, that has been requested ofus. Mrs. C HENOWETH . Thank you, Doctor. You know, I know that the Federal Government has not been entirely lax in trying to provideinformation to consumers about health products. For example, theDepartment of Health and Human Services in their Dietary Guide-lines for Americans publication which provides information aboutthe effect of the diet on health and disease. I am sure that you arefamiliar with this publication. So let us say that this publicationincludes a statement on the benefits of psyllium in fighting heart disease. And let us say I produced psyllium for sale over thecounter as a supplement, but if I quote the Dietary Guidelines forAmericans directly anywhere on the literature, prior to the changethat I don 't know specifically yet what the change is in labeling as- sociated with marketing my product, the FDA can enjoin me andpossibly file criminal charges. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 here at the CDC 's annual review of nutrition which claims that antioxidants, micronutrients appear to play many importantroles in protecting the body against cancer. Now that is the CDC 's own report. The USDA Human Nutrition Agriculture ResearchService Quarterly Report, fourth quarter, 1996 states, ''Anti- oxidants are thought to help prevent heart attack, stroke, and can-cer.'' USDA and DHHS Dietary Guidelines for Americans states in their publication that the antioxidant nutrients found in plantfoods are presently of great interest to scientists and the public be-cause of their potentially beneficial role in reducing the risk of can-cer. So, while the agency is able to make disease claims, if the dietary supplement producers tried to make the same claims that the agen-cy does, they would be having to face those consequences. Dr. H ENNEY . Mrs. Chenoweth, let me respond by saying that Congress did look at this area reasonably recently when they wereconsidering the FDA Modernization Act. And I think that there isprovision within the context of that act to try to clarify the issueof authoritative statement. And, at least as we have tried to trackthe legislative history of the portion of the FDA Modernization Actknown as section 303 I think there was a statement that authori-tative statements such as those you cite could be used by the agen-cy if they represented deliberative reviews. And so we have triedto follow the intent and the letter with respect to that. Sometimes when you go back to those documents or to those bod- ies to see whether the body itself believes that there has been a de-liberative review for some of those statements or even to documentas to whether those statements represented preliminary findingson their part, there is sometimes that information that becomesavailable. But I believe that, if these statements have come fromsuch a body and do represent, in that body 's view, a deliberative review process having taken place, that FDA can accept these typesof statements. So there is that ability to do what you are talkingabout. But there is a process outlined that I believe that we haveto follow. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mrs. Chenoweth. Ms. Schakowsky. Ms. S CHAKOWSKY . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Henney, I am new at this job as well, but neither of us is really new to these kindof issues. I started becoming active in the community in the early1970 's on an effort to get expiration dates on food products. As a young housewife I felt that the more informed we were about theproducts we were buying, the better choices we would be able tomake. And, of course, we have come a long way since then in termsof labeling on products so that we can look at those and decidewhat is best for us, what is safest for us. And I think that most Americans make the assumption \u2014it is not always valid \u2014that somebody is protecting us, that the products that we buy, wouldn 't be on the shelf if somebody weren 't there to make sure that they are OK. And I think we try as best as we canto make sure that that assumption is based in fact. And I wouldhope that on this issue we do that as well. I think a large component of what we need to do, in addition to setting rules and regulations, is getting this information out to thepublic on how to use it and how to make informed choices. What VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May programs are there at the FDA in terms of public health education programs so that we widely disseminate accurate infor-mation on how to use the 1994 law and what it really means? Dr. H ENNEY . Ms. Schakowsky, I very much appreciate somebody else being new to this as well, but I also appreciate your long-standing interest in this whole area of the informed consumer. Ithink with respect to the safety issue, I think consumers can con-tinue to rely that, in terms of a premarketing review of safety, thatclearly is done in the area of conventional foods, new foods, food ad-ditives that might come to the marketplace, and drugs. With dietary supplements, I think, embodied in this act, was the presumption and knowledge that many of these products have beenused for years and, therefore, there was not a need forpreauthorization but an assumption of safety. And that is some ofthe concept, I think, that was embodied in this act, to have accessto products that, by their history, had been established to be safe.But when that was not the case, the agency was given the author-ity to remove them from the market. With respect to initiatives to make consumers more informed about the products that they are using, I think that a few yearsago, under the NLEA, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act,the agency 's first step was to develop that new food label that we saw come onto the market in the last few years. And a few weeksago, we announced that a similar, very clear label, a consistentlabel, a concise label would also be coming onto over-the-counterproducts. And just this week, we have finalized that issue with re-spect to supplements and the supplement label. And so on dietarysupplements in the future, the elements that we will be seeing onall labels will easily identify for the consumer the type of supple-ment it is; per servings; the nutrients; other dietary ingredientsthat might be in the product; and, if it is a botanical, the plant orherb that the product comes from. So I think that there will be a step up with these new labels in terms of the kind of information that a consumer can use. Ms. S CHAKOWSKY . And when will consumers \u2014when can they ex- pect to see those new labels on the products? Dr. H ENNEY . The final rule was published on September 23, 1997, with an effective date of March 23, 1999, giving industry 18months to comply. Products labeled prior to March 23 can continueto be sold until stocks are depleted. Some companies have alreadyintroduced products with the new labels. Ms. S CHAKOWSKY . I do have one other question, Mr. Chairman. Can I go ahead? It is my understanding that the FDA issued in-terim rules prohibiting the use of nine different health claims onfoods. We were talking about that. And that the petitioner for theseclaims, the manufacturers, had submitted statements describingthose claims as authoritative and that there has been some criti-cism, including that of the chairman, that the FDA said that thesestatements were not, in fact, authoritative. And you were talkingabout going back to these scientific bodies that I guess were usedas the basis of those claims. And I would like to clarify what Representative Chenoweth was saying. On the one hand, internally, in their documents, they seemto be making those same claims. When you go back to them and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May Can they be used by the manu- facturers? Those same bodies are saying no. How do we reconcilethat difference? Dr. H ENNEY . One of the key issues, and, again, it was in the leg- islative history of the FDA Modernization Act, was to describewhat authoritative meant, in that authoritative meant, within thecontext of the legislative history, that the statement had comethrough a deliberative review. I am told that, as the agency andthe Department face this issue, that Secretary Shalala asked forrepresentatives of many of those bodies to come together to rep-resent a liaison group from those organizations so that \u2014\u2014 Ms. S CHAKOWSKY . But those organizations, just to clarify, are those like the CDC? Who are we talking about? Dr. H ENNEY . CDC, NIH, and National Academy of Sciences. To establish a channel of communication. One of the key issues ofthose discussions was to learn the context of the Dietary Supple-ment Act of 1994 as well as the context of the FDA ModernizationAct in terms of deliberative review and to know what we would beasking if we queried does the statement represent that of your or-ganization? Has it come through a deliberative review? And the nine statements which you referred to, I believe, al- though I can 't go through every one this morning, in large part, were sent back to those bodies when they sit as organizations andasked that question. And sometimes they said yes or no and thereare some documents, and I believe Representative Chenoweth citedone, where the body doesn 't sit but perhaps once every 5 years. And at the time they are making their statements, they may bepreliminary, so we have no body to go back to, so we rely on thecontext of the statement within the document. And often a state-ment is made, an accompanying statement might say, but these re-sults are preliminary. So we have to be guided by both the state-ment and its context. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Mr. Souder. Mr. S OUDER . I would like to first yield to Mrs. Chenoweth. Mrs. C HENOWETH . Thank you, Mr. Souder. I do want to clarify something, Doctor, that you just mentioned. The cites that I madewere actually public cites; they were published. And so, therefore,they became part of the public domain. They were not internal doc-uments. There were actual published with page numbers, volumes,everything. So I think that takes on an entirely different context,once it becomes part of the public domain, with regards to authori-tative statements that can be closely held internally. Mr. S OUDER . One of the difficulties you have at FDA is if you have products out there that are unsafe and then you are held ac-countable. But I was curious also about the liability that FDAmight have if you list a company in this area as having killedsomeone when they may not have manufactured the product. And,also, if the report is incorrect, then what do you do to correct it in the cite? In other words, what is your liability if you have false in-formation or information that would say that, in effect, a dis-tributor was responsible when they didn 't manufacture? Have you run into the liability question? VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Souder, I would love to be in a position to an- swer your question, but I have a feeling that my Chief Counsel isin a better position to answer your question about the liability. Ms. P ORTER . Mr. Souder, if you are talking legal liability and you are referring to the agency 's adverse event reporting system, I think under ordinary circumstances, the agency 's good faith effort to receive and evaluate adverse events would be viewed as a discre-tionary act and, therefore, exempt from tort liability in the legalsense. If you are referring to the agency 's efforts to do its best to assure within its authority and its resource constraints that the re-ports are correct, well then, of course, the agency would try to dothat. Mr. S OUDER . And if there was a false report, would you make an effort on your Internet site to correct that and is there not just alegal liability, but also an ethical liability if you have damaged acompany? Dr. H ENNEY . Mr. Souder, when we are made aware that there is not even the extreme of false, but information that would appearto be not full or complete, when we are made aware of that, we dohave an ability to at least footnote those reports in that way. Wedo not change in any way the original report that we would havereceived, but we would footnote it as having received informationto the contrary. And that is how we would handle that. Ms. P ORTER . Mr. Souder, let me also add that the adverse events that are reported to the agency as a general matter are made avail-able under the Freedom of Information Act. We try to keep con-fidential the names of the reporters and the names of the indi-vidual patients, but the rest of the report is, in fact, legally avail-able. So I think that would be another reason why the agencywouldn 't be held legally liable. But, as is indicated, within our con- straints, we want to be sure consumers have accurate information. Mr. S OUDER . Why, if a report is false or incorrect, wouldn 't it be deleted? Why would it just be footnoted? Ms. P ORTER . I can 't\u2014I am sorry. Mr. S OUDER . The response was that if the report was proven to be false or just incorrect or you got additional information, youwould footnote it. Why wouldn 't you delete the false information? Ms. P ORTER . It is part of the entire record. I think that would be the answer. Mr. S OUDER . I have some concerns about that. I am not even fa- miliar with the general issue, but there is, in corporate issues, Ifind that that is an uncomfortable answer. In the research area of dietary supplements, in particular, com- plex herbal preparations, does the FDA have a specific team of ex-perts who assist researchers in getting IND clearances? And howdo dietary supplements differ from drugs in this area? Dr. H ENNEY . Mr. Souder, if you will permit me, I would like Mr. Levitt to respond to that question of expertise. Mr. L EVITT . If I understand your question correctly, in terms of if a company wants to submit an IND investigation or a new drugapplication, then that would be done through the Center for DrugEvaluation and Research. And in that case, they have the divisionsseparated according to specialty, so it would depend upon the pur-pose that they would be trying to study. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May So there are not or are there dramatic differences in dietary supplements from other sorts of drugs, whether they beprescription or over-the-counter? In other words, you are sayingthere are different divisions, but they are not necessarily treateddifferently? They just go to a different place? Mr. L EVITT . I believe that all investigational new drug applica- tions are handled together in one unit within the agency and thatis the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Mr. S OUDER . Thank you. Dr. H ENNEY . And, Mr. Souder, we may be trying to split this hair too finely. When you used the term investigational new drug, thatdefinitely would put the herb into a drug category, like a naturalproduct category of drug, and out of the dietary supplement area. Mr. S OUDER . So you are saying it depends on the claim for the dietary supplement as to how you would assign it? Dr. H ENNEY . In part, yes. Mr. S OUDER . Or would it take the claim for a dietary supplement or something you suspect that they may it? Dr. H ENNEY . If you had a natural product, an herb, a plant, let us take digitalis, and you were going to develop that for the treat-ment of arrhythmias for heart disease, and you wanted to marketit as a drug, you would come in through our Center for Drugs forreview. It would require clinical studies and it would require pre-market review for the safety and the efficacy of that drug that wasderived from a plant or an herb. However, if it was an herb in-tended to supplement the diet in some way and met the criteria ofthe Dietary Supplement Act and was not being intended to treata particular disease, you would come in through the dietary supple-ment area which lies over in the Center on Foods. Mr. S OUDER . Thank you very much. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Kucinich, what I would like to do is finish with Dr. Henney and her panel. We have two votes on the floor. Andthen, when we come back, we will take the next panel. So, Mr.Kucinich. Mr. K UCINICH . I will yield to Mr. Waxman. I am fine. I will yield to Mr. Waxman. Mr. W AXMAN . Well, I thank you for yielding. I appreciate it be- cause I did want to get another question in and take advantage ofthe fact that you are here, Dr. Henney. On another subject, I un-derstand an FDA advisory committee is meeting tomorrow to re-view the safety of Rezulin and I am concerned that no one, not theFDA, not Warner-Lambert, not the public knows the exact numberof deaths and injuries associated with Rezulin. What we have arevoluntary adverse event reports which we all recognize constituteonly a fraction of actual deaths and adverse events. Right nowRezulin labeling calls on patients to be tested regularly to ensuretheir livers are functioning properly, but Warner-Lambert is doingnothing to confirm that patients are actually getting tested the waythey should. In your February 25 letter to me, you wrote that the FDA is con- ducting an observational epidemiological study on whether Rezulinpatients were getting tested in 1998. But that is a look backward,not a way to guarantee compliance in the future. Is the agency con-sidering requiring the company to determine, for certain, in the fu- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 with Rezulin 's la- beling? Dr. H ENNEY . Mr. Waxman, one of the reasons why we are hold- ing the advisory committee tomorrow is to get advice from expertson exactly next steps that should be taken. I do have with metoday Janet Woodcock who is the center director for drug evalua-tion and research. She might want to add additional information,but it is just in this context that we are holding the meeting withthe advisory committee to give them an update on where we arewith this product to see if any further monitoring, labeling, or ac-tion with respect to the drug is warranted at this point. Mr. W AXMAN . Before she comments on that question, let me also ask you about the fact that on Monday the British FDA, the Medi-cines Control Agency, decided Rezulin was unsafe to be marketedin Britain. Has the FDA reviewed the facts and the medical basisfor their decision? And is the FDA aware of all the same reporteddeaths and injuries that the British were aware of in making theirdecision to ban Rezulin? Dr. H ENNEY . I will have to ask Dr. Woodcock to respond to that. Dr. W OODCOCK . Yes. To answer your second question first, we have been in close contact with the British authorities and theirdeliberations, so we are aware of that. As far as knowing the exactnumber of deaths from the use of any drug in the United States,that would require 100 percent registry of all patients taking thedrug and that is an extraordinary step that FDA has taken onlyvery rarely, such as with thalidomide. We do believe that we havefairly good information on new deaths that have occurred with thisdrug, for a variety of reasons. We will be discussing, as Dr. Henneysaid, any additional steps that should be taken and the results ofthe epidemiologic study on the monitoring. Mr. W AXMAN . Coming back to the subject that is not unrelated, manufacturers are currently required to report adverse eventswhen it is a drug. Do you believe that dietary supplement manufac-turers should report adverse events and have you discussed whatsteps FDA has taken to try to enhance its adverse event reportingsystem? Dr. H ENNEY . Mr. Waxman, our adverse event reporting system is open to all products that FDA regulates. We do believe thatthere are enhancements to that system that certainly should occur.We currently have before the Appropriations Committee a requestto increase the level of funding that we would have available so wecan enhance that kind of injury reporting system so we could havea better handle on events, be they with the devices, drugs, or die-tary supplements, in terms of actions that the agency might needto take. Mr. W AXMAN . With a drug, I think there is a requirement to re- port adverse events. On dietary supplements, is there any kind ofrequirement or are you relying solely on \u2014\u2014 Dr. H ENNEY . Mr. Waxman, most of our reporting systems are voluntary. The required reporting system that I am aware of \u2014 within the agency there may be others \u2014is with device manufactur- ers that must report to us. But in terms of individual physiciansseeing events with their patients, we rely heavily on a voluntaryreporting system in all of our products. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 Kucinich, did you have any questions you would like to ask? Well, do you want Dr. Henney and the paneliststo wait? If you have any questions, we have a few minutes. Mr. K UCINICH . Well, I am going to submit some questions in writing. OK? Mr. B URTON . Would you be willing to respond to those questions in writing? Dr. H ENNEY . Oh, absolutely. Mr. K UCINICH . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Well, I think we have concluded all of the questions for you. I want to thank you very much. It has been nice havingyou here today and we will look forward to working with you in thefuture. Dr. H ENNEY . All right. Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Thank you very much, all of you. We stand in re- cess at the call of the Chair. We will be back in about 10 or 15 min-utes. We have two votes on the floor. [Recess.]Mr. B URTON . If everybody could take their seats, we will be pre- pared to start with the next panel. Ms. Welch, you are welcome to sit right there.Ms. W ELCH . OK. Thank you. Mr. B URTON . First of all, on behalf of the Congress and the com- mittee, we want to welcome you to the U.S. Congress. I think ev-erybody has been an admirer of yours for years. We have watchedyou on screen and stage and we have really not only admired yourbeauty, but your acting skills as well. And we are very happy tohave you here today to testify about nutrition and supplements. Soif you are prepared for an opening statement, proceed. Ms. W ELCH . Yes, I am. Thank you very much. Mr. G ILMAN . Mr. Chairman, could I \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Oh, excuse me. Pardon me. Mr. Ben Gilman, our chairman of the International Operations Committee had a briefstatement he wanted to put in the record. So \u2014\u2014 Mr. G ILMAN . Thank you. We are conducting a hearing across the hall on Russian policy and I thank you for the opportunity. I regretI couldn 't be here earlier. And I want to apologize to our witness. But I do want to put in an opening statement. The passage of the Dietary Supplemental Health and Education Act of 1994 I think has brought about a number of important im-provements for millions of Americans who regularly consume die-tary supplements to protect and improve their health. DSHEAguarantees the right of Americans to have access to the traditionalsupplements that consumers have used for a number of years andnew products that are just beginning to come into the market todayand DSHEA ensures that these new products are safe and properlylabeled for sale in our Nation. Studies and testimonial statements from consumers have shown that supplements can and do improve good health. However, theFDA 's slow acknowledgement of the benefits of dietary supple- ments has brought us here today and, without DSHEA, there is nouniform quality of products and the lack of information about thesekind of supplements that are available to the public. So once theregulations will be in place and practice \u2014and I am pleased that VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 Henney has indicated that they are moving in that direction \u2014once they are in place and practice, consumers can be confident that supplements will be safe and regulated. We must make certain that the FDA implements DSHEA as pre- scribed for in the act of 1994. So I am pleased the new FDA Com-missioner, Ms. Jane Henney, has testified here this morning thatshe will be dedicated to help FDA fairly interpret, implement, andenforce the provisions of this act as they were intended when Con-gress initially passed the act. And while some have argued thatDSHEA is full of complex questions of fact, policy, and law, it isthe duty of FDA and its Commissioner to enact this measure andprovide the American consumers with safe and regulated dietarysupplements. And I want to commend our witness, Raquel Welch, for coming to us today to give us her thoughts with regard to these supple-ments. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Well, before I yield to Ms. Welch, Mr. Waxman is your Congressman and he would like to say a word of welcome.And I don 't blame him a bit. Mr. W AXMAN . I want to tell you how pleased I am to be here to hear your testimony and to welcome you to our committee hearing.We came back from the vote anxious to hear your testimony andI am going to be able to hear it, but I was also able to hear Mr.Gilman 's statement as well. Unfortunately, I want to apologize to you because I am not going to be able to join you and other Mem-bers for the lunch after your testimony because I have a previousengagement with Bishop Desmond Tutu from South Africa. But Iwant to welcome you here. I look forward to your testimony. I hopeI will be able to stay to ask some questions, but I just appreciateyour willingness to come here and tell us your views. Ms. W ELCH . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . OK, Ms. Welch. STATEMENT OF RAQUEL WELCH, ACTRESS Ms. W ELCH . Well, good morning, Chairman Burton, members of the committee, and a special greeting to my Congressman, HenryWaxman of California. I am Raquel Welch and, before I begin, I would just like to say that I am not a paid spokesperson for the dietary supplement in-dustry nor do I have any financial connections with it. I am heretoday because of a statement made by former Surgeon General C.Everett Koop, who is quoted as saying, ''If you want to be success- ful in life, pursue good health. '' I am a woman who has played many roles: an actress, a wife, a mother, and a person who made a decision some 25 years ago totake an active role in maintaining my health and well-being. It hasbeen one of the most important roles of my life and, much like ademanding role in a film or a play, it requires preparation andstudy. On the screen and on stage, you prepare with a script. If youhave chosen to make dietary supplements part of your life, as Ihave, you prepare by getting information. The availability of truthful, balanced information on the dietary supplement labels is guaranteed now by the Dietary SupplementHealth and Education Act. Congress unanimously voted in favor of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May 's right to know what dietary supplements are for and how they work. Most importantly, this information is mandated tobe where customers can look first, on the label. For the past 5 years, customers have had access to valuable in- formation on how supplements affect the structure and function ofthe body. These congressionally mandated structure function state-ments now appear on dietary supplement labels, allowing cus-tomers like me to make informed choices. However, I have recentlybeen informed by the National Nutritional Foods Association thatthe FDA has proposed rules which would severely curtail thesestructure function statements. And, therefore, restrict the informa-tion that Congress intended these statements to impart. Mr. Chairman, as you well know and as I have learned, structure function statements must not say that a dietary supplement is in-tended to cure, treat, prevent, or diagnose any disease and a dis-claimer to that effect must appear on the label in conjunction withany structure function statement. My understanding is that whatthe FDA proposes is to expand the definition of disease to the pointthat virtually all structural function statements would be discour-aged or outlawed. I know that there are instances where label statements have been made beyond the explicit limits stated in the Dietary Supple-ment Act. I believe that even the FDA records will show that theseclaims are found on only an infinitesimal number of products, ap-proximately 1 percent. As a consumer, it seems to me that the FDAshould use its enforcement powers to eliminate these questionableand unsubstantiated claims. That would be understandable andlogical. However, instead, the agency is proposing virtual elimi-nation of an entire category of consumer information with broad re-strictions and confusing rules. I would say that is like killing a fleawith a cannon. Mr. Chairman, millions of consumers like me have and will ben- efit from learning more about these supplements from the struc-ture function statements. What the FDA is proposing seems like aregulatory sleight-of-hand to stifle such statements. I implore youand the members of this committee to urge the FDA to withdrawits proposed rule. The language in the existing Dietary SupplementAct already gives sufficient direction and establishes explicit limi-tations on structure function statements. And it gives FDA the au-thority it needs to chase down delinquent companies and theirproducts. The FDA 's proposal ignores congressional intent and flies in the face of the best interests of the 100 million Americans who, likeme, take dietary supplements every day. We need and ask for yourhelp if health-conscious citizens are to continue to be able to makeinformed health choices. It is, after all, part of the American way. I have been taking supplements since 1 million years B.C. [Laughter.] So please support us. Thank you very much.[The prepared statement of Ms. Welch follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I saw ''1 Million B.C., '' and those supplements really work, I have got to tell you. [Laughter.] First of all, let me thank you for coming today. You represent, as you said, a lot of Americans who take supplements, amongwhich I am one. And how do you decide, as an individual, whatsupplements you should take? Ms. W ELCH . Well, I think I am a pretty average Joe in regard to that. I hear that something is effective and then I try to get theinformation about it. Sometimes you can work through a dis-tributor who you can get in touch with personally and they can ex-plain everything to you and ask all kinds of questions. But mosttimes, I have to go in to a health shop, a health place, where theyhave all these supplements, and read the labels and decide for my-self what I think is the best thing to do. But I want to just say,briefly, although you didn 't ask me, that this is always in conjunc- tion with regular medical check-ups. Mr. B URTON . Sure. Ms. W ELCH . And, you know, under a doctor 's care and every- thing. But I rely heavily on the labels and on the individual dis-tributor who can tell me a lot about these things. Mr. B URTON . You don 't have to answer this question, but what kind of supplements do you take? Ms. W ELCH . Too many to mention. I just take supplements every day and I take a wide variety of multivitamins and I also takeother things that I guess could be classified as women 's supple- ments like calcium and those kinds of things. And I also take blue-green algae supplements. Mr. B URTON . What kind of an impact do you think these supple- ments have had on your life? Ms. W ELCH . Well, I have found, very specifically, that when I have tried certain supplements, that they have helped my energylevel, which I need when I am on Broadway. For instance, the lasttime I found something new in the way of a supplement was whenI was in rehearsal for Victor/Victoria and I found my energy level,you know, sort of dropping lower and lower and I was eating allthe right foods. I don 't smoke and drink. And, as everyone knows, I am pretty much of a health creature and fairly disciplined. But I found myself slumping and actually my brother said to me that he knew of a distributor that handled blue-green algae prod-ucts and that they were very effective in boosting up energy in avery natural way, no caffeines or anything that revs you up, youknow, and makes you speed away. So I started taking them andthey were very effective and I have been taking them still. Mr. B URTON . Well, I just have one last question and I think you may have answered it in your opening statement. You do believethe information that you are getting on these supplements that youbuy in the health food store is adequate and well-enough labeled? Ms. W ELCH . I believe they are. I would like more information, but as, according to what, you know, the rules and the laws arenow, I think to have less would be a very bad thing. Mr. B URTON . We had the Commissioner in just before you testi- fied and I believe they are going to try to expand the informationon the labels and in the products so that consumers will even havemore information. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 I think that would be very helpful. And when I was growing up as a young girl, there was nothing like a health foodstore or a health store which you could go in and get vitamins andsupplements. That was just not in the mix at all. And as I havecome along now, this is very much an everyday thing and every-body I know takes supplements of one kind or another. It is inter-esting to note that the next generation or certainly the generationthat is, you know, out there now, you know, is conversant with thiskind of thing and they usually hear on the grapevine that some-thing is working well and they go in to find out for themselves. It would be better if we had more specific information, I think, and more of it. Of course there are books and you can get wholebooks on herbal supplements and vitamins and what they do. Be-cause I think most people now have an attitude about preventativemedicine trying to go to the doctor on a regular basis, but for treat-ment only as a last resort if you can 't cure your malady by some- thing that can help your immune system or to keep you strongerand more energetic on a regular basis so you are not going into thedoctor with all kinds of small fry stuff that really does affect thequality of your health on an everyday basis. Mr. B URTON . Very good. Mr. Waxman. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much for your testimony. You are sure right about the idea that it is onlyrecently we have been learning so much about the impact of dietand how beneficial some of these vitamins and supplements can be.But to me the most shocking thing was that, for so many years,doctors didn 't even take classes in nutrition in medical school. So we need to educate everybody about the value of nutrition in ourdiet, whether it is from food products themselves or from supple-ments that would make up for the lack of some of the essential nu-trients that we need. Ms. W ELCH . I think that the stress in modern-day life makes us not absorb some of the nutrients from our food and that is why.And I think that the new woman \u2014if I can call her that \u2014of this last 100 years has been expanding her horizons so much that herenergy is often taxed. I think men too, in modern society, have thisproblem so they try to shore up their resources as best they canin a natural way. In defense of current physicians, I would just say that, I guess going to medical school is a pretty barrage of so much informationthat is about really serious illnesses, that it takes a great deal oftime and effort to absorb that and, therefore, it is difficult, youknow, because it isn 't in our culture, common knowledge. I would think that probably the next generation of physicians will knowmore about this kind of thing. Mr. W AXMAN . Well, I certainly hope so and I think the medical schools are trying to adapt and recognize the fact that it would cer-tainly be beneficial for our society if we could prevent some of thesediseases and not just deal with them after they occur. In gettingthe information, we all want accurate information. We want toknow which products will be helpful and which ones will not. AndI think that sometimes I get concerned when someone who standsto make a lot of money wants to tell me how their product is sogood for me and I want to know that somebody is sort of watching VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May sure that, when they make those claims, there is some valid- ity. Don 't you feel that way too? Ms. W ELCH . I do feel that way. And I am certainly a supporter of the FDA and everything that it represents and all that it does.However, I do believe that, when we are talking about herbs andsome of these supplements, we are talking about things thathaven 't just arrived yesterday. Only, perhaps, in this culture, but in other cultures throughout the world, they have been used for lit-erally hundreds and thousands of years. So there is a kind of aknowledge, if you will, that is among kind of a \u2014I want to say the word traditional \u2014but historical knowledge of these herbs and other supplements and vitamins that is known to people and it isn 't\u2014I don't think \u2014I don 't think it is even advertised any near as strongly or with as much as the exploitation value as most of our other foodproducts are on the market, television and magazines, today. Mr. W AXMAN . Well, there is a lot more advertising, a lot more on television and newspapers and magazines for one product or an-other. Ms. W ELCH . Yes, it is an important thing to look out for. I per- sonally don 't think that we are to that level yet in this particular dietary supplement area where we are being delinquent in ourclaims. But that is just my opinion as a consumer. Mr. W AXMAN . Yes, but when we passed the bill, though, some Members advocated that we allow people to say that their productwould cure diseases without going through any FDA review or test. Ms. W ELCH . Well, that would be wrong. Mr. W AXMAN . And I thought so too. So you don 't want to let them say a product cures diseases, yet the structure function claims canget very close to saying a product cures a disease. So it is a hardline to draw. What we want the FDA to do is to draw that line ina way that will get the information that the public needs to knowwithout having people deceived with claims that aren 't accurate, that can 't be checked out, and over which FDA would no \u2014\u2014 Ms. W ELCH . So I take you are in favor of this particular FDA regulation. Mr. W AXMAN . The regulations? I haven 't looked at them. I haven 't looked at them specifically. I was in favor of the structure function claims and I want structure function claims to be per-mitted, but I don 't want disease claims to go under the guise of a structure function claim. You wouldn 't, would you? Ms. W ELCH . No, I wouldn 't. But I don 't know that they are claims as much as they are information. I mean, people have toknow what they are taking it for. Mr. W AXMAN . Well, information from somebody who is trying to sell you a product. Ms. W ELCH . Well, that is the American way, isn 't that right? [Laughter.] Mr. W AXMAN . Because I always get a little suspicious \u2014I didn 't hear what you said. Ms. W ELCH . I said that is the American way. We are all selling something. Mr. W AXMAN . Well, I suppose that is true, but then a lot of times the consumers are deceived as a result of it so we want to makesure that \u2014\u2014 VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 That is true, but I do think \u2014\u2014 Mr. W AXMAN . When it comes to your health, people get very anx- ious about it. We do live in a time when there is a lot of anxiety,but we want people to have access to products that are going to behelpful, not harmful. Ms. W ELCH . I absolutely agree, but I think that the statutes, as they stand now, are sufficient guidelines to have protection for thepublic. Mr. W AXMAN . The statute has to be implemented. Ms. W ELCH . Yes. Mr. W AXMAN . So they have to decide what the statute is so they have to adopt regulations. Ms. W ELCH . The regulations, yes. Mr. W AXMAN . So you would prefer they draft the regulations dif- ferently than what they have proposed and FDA is now consideringall of the comments they have received and we will see what theycome up with. But thank you very much. Ms. W ELCH . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Mrs. Chenoweth. Mrs. C HENOWETH . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Welch, I am just thrilled that you are here and the evidence is in the package,I guess. I would have to say you do handle such a tremendousschedule and, obviously, your personage speak volumes for our con-cerns. Thank you very much for taking the time out of your busyschedule to be here. Ms. W ELCH . Thank you. Thank you. Mrs. C HENOWETH . You know, I guess I have the feeling, like most Americans, that I really want to take my own health concernsinto my hands as much as possible and stay healthy, stay ener-getic, ahead of the power curve of getting sick and then having toseek medical help. And I kind of want to use an analogy, based onwhat Mr. Waxman said. Every morning, I juice up my own carrotsand celery and apple and parsley. And that is an energy drink andvery good for me. It is full of vitamin A and other vitamins. ButI wouldn 't want the Federal Government, because I drink this juice that is also sold in health food stores, because I know it gives meenergy, to tell me whether or not I can go to the grocery store, whois probably making a small profit on those carrots that I am buy-ing, and, you know, because of that, I still want to be free to beable to make my own juices or take my own supplements and takecare of my own body, ahead of the power curve. Ms. W ELCH . Of course. Of course. We all need information about that. That is the thing. Especially the new generation who will bestarting out. Let us say that there is some young woman or youngman that is \u2014and this is, of course, totally in agreement with what you are saying \u2014and is going to come along and say, you know, I want to be healthy. I want to make the best of my life. I have thisambition and I know I am going to need optimum health and en-ergy, like Koop said, you know, to make my way in life. So, youknow, I have been told that if I take some vitamin C, I am notgoing to get, you know, sick as fast or if I feel the cold coming on.These kind of things will be passed along and they will go in andthey will read a label. Now if the label doesn 't say anything, they are going to be deterred from even trying because they don 't\u2014they VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 have any information. I think that we have to have on the labels things that help people understand. It is up to them whether they take the vitamin C and say, forget about it, you know. This doesn 't do a thing for me. You know, it is not like we are forcing people into this, to say, oh, you must doit. I mean, a lot of things that some people take don 't work at all for me and I wouldn 't do it, I wouldn 't have them, I wouldn 't buy them. Or I returned them after having bought them and thought,you know, this isn 't for me at all. Mrs. C HENOWETH . Thank you. Ms. W ELCH . Sorry to interrupt you, but I thought we were talk- ing about the same thing. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mrs. Chenoweth. Mrs. Morella. Mrs. M ORELLA . It is a great honor. Thank you very much for being here. I reiterate what the committee feels about your per-sonal experience really enhancing the implementation of the Die-tary Supplement Health and Education Act that this Congresspassed. You know, I do look at labels of some of the supplementswhen I go to a health food store and I am always curious aboutwhat they will do and what they will not do. Do we, as consumers,have an obligation to do studying or other reading to help us in thedecisionmaking? I always wonder, how much am I supposed toknow when I look at these items in the health food store? Ms. W ELCH . How much? I don 't know, you know. I am not, you know, an expert on this, I just can speak from my own personalexperience. I think, short of making claims to cure and do some-thing special for you, they just need to say, first of all, what theycontain and what they do. And then I think you have to be deduc-tive yourself and make your decision. And, like so many things inthis world, it does come from trial and error. I think we are tryingto save consumers from spending money unnecessarily or givingthem hopes that are not going to be \u2014\u2014 Mrs. M ORELLA . We have to be careful of that caveat emptor, you know, let the buyer beware. Ms. W ELCH . Yes, exactly. Mrs. M ORELLA . And, yet, we have an obligation \u2014I guess that is the balance I am trying to resolve \u2014we have an obligation to also look at what we know about certain products before we automati-cally believe what we would like to have them be able to do. Ms. W ELCH . Well, I would agree if this was a drug we were talk- ing about. What I am basically saying is that I think that there ex-ists already all the provisions to protect the consumer. I think togo beyond that is going over the line. It is a fine line, but I thinkit is going over the line and could possibly inhibit the taking ofthese things to people who do take them now and the people whowill not have access to them in the near future. I mean, because it takes a tremendous amount of time to go through and test, so to speak, everything when some of thesethings have literally been around as if they had never been seenbefore. But since most of them have been around for, you know, thebeginning of civilization, practically. You know, it seems to me, asI said, killing a flea with a cannon. I know that there is an obliga-tion, but it is almost like saying, well, what will carrots do for you?Shall we ban carrots; they are not right for you. I mean, herbs have VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May for so long. I mean, you either don 't want carrots or you do want carrots, you know. Mrs. M ORELLA . I love to believe what I see. And what I see and I read I am never sure. I mean, like I grew up with the idea thatyou take your carrots for your vision and fish was for the brainand, you know, some of those concepts. And, yet, I think there isa certain amount of self-education that is important. Ms. W ELCH . It is. You are right. Mrs. M ORELLA . You heard our new FDA Director this morning talk about her recommendations for the implementation? Ms. W ELCH . I am sorry. Mrs. M ORELLA . Did you hear the new Director? Ms. W ELCH . No, I am sorry I did not hear it. Her recommenda- tions for \u2014\u2014 Mrs. M ORELLA . How she was going to implement this act. Did you? Ms. W ELCH . No, I am sorry. I did not hear that. I was not aware that she was making a statement. Mrs. M ORELLA . It will be very interesting to, for us, it would be our obligation, to see how she follows through on that. But I think,Mr. Chairman, the fact that you have this hearing makes us allvery much aware and I think it helps the FDA, to know how Con-gress feels and how the citizenry feel. And your being here as a rolemodel. We thank you very much. Ms. W ELCH . Thank you. Mrs. M ORELLA . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Mrs. Biggert, do you have any comments or ques- tions? Mrs. B IGGERT . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Welch, when you are talking about the diet supplements, are you talking aboutsomething that might have been \u2014you said this goes back for like centuries, something like things that have been used by like NativeAmericans or \u2014\u2014 Ms. W ELCH . They could be, but they could be \u2014\u2014 Mrs. B IGGERT . Like teas or like roots. Is this part of the dietary supplement or \u2014\u2014 Ms. W ELCH . I don 't\u2014yes, it would be part of dietary supple- ments. There are a lot of teas that are very useful, I think, for var-ious functions, you know. The thing is that, you know, they are notgoing to \u2014one particular product, whatever it may be, that is not a drug, is not going to work the same on each person. You know,camomile tea is supposed to calm you down and relax you. You cantake it before sleep. I am sure this helps many, many people. It hasnever helped me. But it is not a bad tea. I am perfectly happy tohave my camomile tea from time to time because of the taste. Mrs. B IGGERT . It is like some people with caffeine. They can 't drink it at night. Ms. W ELCH . Caffeine is very difficult for me. That is one of the reasons why \u2014I mean, caffeine really causes, in my body, a very de- cided reaction that is negative. And I can get terrible migraineheadaches from it and really, you know, throw my whole nervoussystem off which affects other parts of my body. It is not a nicething. So I try to avoid that. So I am looking for other ways that VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May naturally, you know, shore up my energy without speeding around like a Looney Tunes. I don 't like that kind of a thing at all. Mrs. B IGGERT . What you are saying as far as finding the right diet, the right nutrition, is really the responsibility of each of usto find out what works. Ms. W ELCH . Yes. I think so. As in everything in life, I think that one of the beliefs I have is that each one of us really does have tofind in everything in life what works for them. There are all thesethings available. I think that to try to take on the responsibilityfor what the individual person has to find for themselves is toomuch to ask of anybody, even the government. Mrs. B IGGERT . I think that we probably do that. Like with preg- nancy, years ago everybody took all the vitamins, took everything.And then there was this big thing about not using anything thatmight be harmful. Ms. W ELCH . I am sure that is true. And, yet, I am sure that pregnant mothers today would probably take a lot more vitaminsor would want to. I haven 't been pregnant in many years, so I can 't tell you what they do now. [Laughter.] Mrs. B IGGERT . No, I haven 't either, fortunately. But thank you very much for coming. I appreciate it. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Ms. Welch. We are expecting Mr. Kucinich. I think he wants to ask just a few questions before werelease you from the table. But I want to assure you that we willbe watching and working with the Food and Drug Administration,as well as the people in the industry, to make sure that the struc-ture function rule doesn 't change the intent of the DSHEA law. It is extremely important, I think, that the will of the people ex-pressed through the legislation passed by the Congress be followedby every bureaucracy in our government. And if we find a bureauc-racy that tries to supersede existing law that has been passed bythe Congress with a regulation, then I think that we need to holdthem and call them to account. And we will certainly do that. Ms. W ELCH . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . I will yield to Ms. Norton. Do you have any ques- tions? Ms. N ORTON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As a result of hearing Ms. Welch 's testimony, I must say that she has inspired some ques- tions in me. The first is, Ms. Welch, have you ever heard of the pla-cebo effect? Ms. W ELCH . Yes, I have. Isn 't that where somebody takes a sub- stance which is being tested and it really doesn 't have anything in it, and then, because of psychological reasons, it seems to work ornot work? Ms. N ORTON . Yes. It is, you know, when we take something, we want it to work and we are all human. That is why we require con-trolled studies for medicines, because it would be very dangerousto rely on the placebo effect and so, as a matter of the scientificmethod, it is understood worldwide. We normally do not rely on an- ecdotal evidence for the reason that, interestingly, you say, for thereason that something may work on me and not work on you. Cam-omile tea doesn 't make everyone sleepy; it makes some people sleepy. Well, at some point, the world wants to know whether or VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May makes most people sleepy or only some people sleepy some of the time. The only thing that disturbs me about your testimony is this no- tion that, despite all that the scientific method has established forhundreds of years, you seem to believe that, for something as pre-cious as your body, how you receive it should be the answer, evenif that may be, in fact, the placebo effect and you may be spendingyour good money on a placebo. Ms. W ELCH . No, I don 't happen to believe that is true. I know what you are getting at, but I don 't know how any study could help every person know how it is going to work on them. That is impos-sible. And \u2014\u2014 Ms. N ORTON . And no study purports to do that. Ms. W ELCH . And I don 't think it is possible. Ms. N ORTON . The studies do purport to tell us whether, in the main, the claim to effect is valid or not. And I was interested, asyou said, people do deserve as much information as possible. Isn 't that the kind of information you would want people to have? In themain, recognizing that there are always some people who die of as-pirin, even though most of us get our headaches cured by it, in themain, I would want to know that a very tiny percent die of aspirin.But I would also want to know whether or not aspirin cures head-aches. In the same way, and I speak as somebody who, in fact, takes all kinds of these things, so judges for herself, like you, but themore I know whether or not somebody who I trust, some scientificexpert says it works, the more confident I am that I am takingwhat is right for me. And from what I hear you want it. I thinkyou would feel better if you knew \u2014\u2014 Ms. W ELCH . No, I don 't think so. Ms. N ORTON [continuing]. That somebody you trusted, in fact, said that this substance should work this way, as opposed to wordof mouth telling you that it works this way. Ms. W ELCH . Well, I can only say that about 10 million Americans feel adequately informed at this point to take these supplementsregularly and I happen to be one of them. I respect your disagree-ment with me. Ms. N ORTON . I would think that for somebody like you and me who have taken but relying on what is on the label, that what wewould want the FDA to do is not fail to tell us what works andwhat doesn 't work as a scientific matter. What I think we should be pressing the FDA to do is to find some way to test these sub-stances faster so that we have information to rely on. We ought tobe pressing the scientific agency to do its job, rather than saying,step back; we don 't need you. Let us simply rely on what is in our head, which may be a placebo. Ms. W ELCH . I am not saying that. I am saying rely on what is existing right now in the FDA in the rules that are existing now.Instead of what I understand to be the idea is to take the definitionof disease and expand it to such a degree that, for instance, preg-nancy, menopause, things that like that are what I consider nor-mal, would not be considered normal. And you are expanding thedefinition of the word disease to such a degree that pretty soon youcan't say anything. I have heard you use the word claim many VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May 't use the word claim in my statement and I don 't be- lieve that the rules that are in place now, the laws that are inplace now talk about any claim. In fact, I think it precludes makingany claim. So I think we are talking about something that reallyis not \u2014I am not talking about today. I am not talking about mak- ing a claim. Ms. N ORTON . The law doesn 't exist, as a practical matter, until regulations are issued determining the law. Ms. W ELCH . Yes, I know. These technicalities, you will have to forgive me, I am not accustomed to them. Ms. N ORTON . Just let me say that I join you in your confidence in many of these substances and I think the only thing we can sayabout the 10 million people who take them is that the more infor-mation they have, the more confidence they will have in what theyare taking. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Ms. Norton. I am not sure Mr. Kucinich is going to make it. Let me just end up by saying that I share yourconcerns. I share your desire for adequate information about sup-plements and I share your concern that we not allow bureaucraciesto supersede the rulemaking authority of the Congress of theUnited States when it passes a law. That law to which you referredin your testimony, the DSHEA law, was passed overwhelmingly byboth the House and the Senate. And for any agency to try to im-pose a regulation that supersedes the intent of the law is justwrong. And this committee, which oversees the entire Federal Gov-ernment and every agency of the Federal Government, will exerciseits authority to make sure that the regulatory agencies adhere tothe law. Now we will try to work with them to make sure that theconsumer is protected, as you have stated in your statement. Butwe are going to make sure that the law is followed. And, towardthat end, I want to thank you very, very much for being here. Ms. W ELCH . Thank you. My pleasure. Mr. B URTON . Your celebrity not only adds a great deal to our hearing, but it adds a great deal to the American public 's aware- ness of how important this issue is. And I am sure people acrossthe country who may be watching this on television are going toappreciate you taking the time out of your busy schedule to comehere and testify. And, with that, let me just say that we are going to recess. And those who will be panelists this afternoon, along with Ms. Welch,if you would like to join us in the back for a brief respite wherewe can have a bite to eat, and maybe talk with her just a moment,I would really appreciate that. And, once again, thank you very,very much for being here, Ms. Welch. Ms. W ELCH . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . We stand in recess until the fall of gavel, around 1 p.m. [Whereupon, at 12:32 p.m., the committee recessed, to reconvene at 1:05 p.m., the same day.] Mr. B URTON [presiding]. We will reconvene the hearing, and I would like to ask Mr. Bass, Mr. Kracov, Dr. Croom, Mr. McCaleb,Mr. Turner, Dr. Dickinson, to VerDate we don 't have the vast majority of media here to hear your testimony, I want you to know that it is very importantfor the record and it will help us make the proper case to otherMembers of Congress about the importance of dietary supplements.So I want you to know I really appreciate your patience and yourbeing here to testify. And, with that, let me start. I will just startdown at the left end by that sexy Mr. Bass \u2014[laughter] \u2014who we talked to and kidded with a little bit earlier. Didn 't we, Mr. Bass? Would you like to start and make your opening remarks? STATEMENTS OF I. SCOTT BASS, J.D., ADJUNCT PROFESSOR, DANIEL NATIONAL CENTER FORTHE DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL PRODUCTS RESEARCH,INSTITUTE OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES AT THESCHOOL OF PHARMACY, UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI; ROB-ERT S. MCCALEB, PRESIDENT, HERB RESEARCH FOUNDA-TION, BOULDER, CO; JAMES S. TURNER, CITIZENS FORHEALTH; ANNETTE DICKINSON, VICE PRESIDENT, SCI-ENTIFIC AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS, COUNCIL FOR RE-SPONSIBLE NUTRITION; AND PROFESSOR MARGARETGILHOOLEY, SETON HALL UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW Mr. B ASS. Chairman Burton, thank you very much for the oppor- tunity to testify today with respect to the Dietary SupplementHealth and Education and, particularly, with respect to the FDAproposed structure function regulations. The committee has sug-gested that I speak from an academic legal perspective and I ap-preciate that. I am an adjunct professor at the Georgetown University Grad- uate School of Public Policy and I head the Food and Drug Lawpractice at Sidley and Austin in Washington, DC. I am a graduateof the University of Michigan Law School, I have coauthored theprincipal book on the Food and Drug 's Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act and was heavily in the drafting of that act inthe 3 years proceeding the October 1994 enactment. Our clients in-clude both pharmaceutical companies and dietary supplement com-panies, functional food companies as well as the National Nutri-tional Foods Association. Hopefully, then, I can bring a balancedperspective to the issues before this committee. The first thing I would like to discuss is, very briefly, how die- tary supplements were regulated before DSHEA, in order to set theframework for how dietary supplements are being treated underthese structure function regulations. The main law that applies todietary supplements is the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct. Now, back then, it was quite easy to determine the line be-tween the function of drugs and the function of foods. Essentially,any product that was intended to treat, mitigate, or cure diseasewas a drug and anything that was supposed to affect structure orfunction, except for conventional foods, was also a drug. By the 1960 's, the dietary patterns of Americans began to change and the demands for information about health changed. However,FDA continued, until DSHEA, to regulate health-related informa-tion under the 1938 act and those precepts that we discussed ear- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 huge public opposition in the 1970 's to FDA 's attempt to limit the potencies of vitamins and minerals that would be avail-able to consumers that led to the enactment of what is popularlycalled the Proxmire amendments to section 411 of the act. By the 1980 's, people began to demand more and more ability to take control of their own health. Kellogg 's came out with a cam- paign that fiber might lead to the prevention of certain types ofcancers. FDA opposed this and, after many years of regulatory con-tention, Congress passed the Nutrition Labeling and Education Actthat carved out an exception to this 1938 food/drug distinction.They said that companies that sell foods can make health claims. Now that term ''health claims '' is not clearly understood in some quarters so I am going to spend just a second explaining that. Ahealth claim is essentially a claim that you will reduce the risk ofa long-term disease. A drug claim is a ''treatment, cure, prevention '' of a disease. Health claims are sort of a cut-out or carve-out fromdrug claims. After FDA had essentially told the industry in its proposed NLEA regulations that they were not going to recognize any claimsfor herbs at all because they weren 't nutritional products, that they weren 't going to recognize structure function claims for dietary sup- plements, the type we have today, Congress passed DSHEA and,in so passing, created a brand-new definitional category for dietarysupplements that wasn 't present in the 1938 law. This brought much more information to consumers, but it also brought a host ofinterpretational concerns. The one thing, Mr. Chairman, that you mentioned earlier today, which I think is probably the most important for the public, is theconception that people have read that DSHEA took the safety pow-ers away from FDA. And I won 't dwell on that because I think you very articulately set that straight. But let me say that that derivesfrom an old theory FDA used to use when they said, ''you can 't sue a supplement because of claims, because it doesn 't have any claims, '' but \u2014using ginseng as an example \u2014you have a ginseng capsule, they argued: because you add ginseng to the ginseng cap-sule, the ginseng is a food additive. Now one would say, who cares?Well, the answer was if FDA called it a food additive, they couldnever lose a case because they didn 't have to prove it unsafe. All they had to do was submit an affidavit of one FDA scientist sayingthat, in my opinion, experts do not agree this is generally recog-nized as safe among experts in the field and that was the end ofthe case. There was no defense. As you will hear in a minute, thatis very relevant to today 's proposal on structure function claims. We turn to claims in general, then. One of the most important parts of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act wassection 6 that is before your committee today, structure functionclaims. Those claims essentially allow a company to tell how a sub-stance beneficially affects the way in which the body functions, howyou maintain or support your immune system or the mechanism byhow that dietary ingredient operates in your body. They can alsotalk about general well-being claims. Again, just to draw the record, a drug claim would talk about, for example, ''fiber extract cures colon cancer. '' The health claim would be ''eating fiber with exercise and a good diet might reduce VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May of certain types of cancers. '' Whereas a structure function claim would be ''a fiber supplement can help to maintain normal and healthy digestive systems and the functioning of yourcolon. '' That distinction is very important today. So I turn, then, to the last portion of my remarks, to the pro- posals that Congress is looking at today. That is the April 28, 1998structure function proposed regulation. I have four points I wouldlike to make today about that proposed regulation. The first is that,in my opinion, it must be withdrawn. I believe that that regulationundercuts the purpose that Congress had in enacting section 6 ofDSHEA. I believe that FDA attempted in good faith to try to drawa line, but that that good faith attempt went awry and went intomuch too much detail and much too broad a scope to eliminate hon-est, good information to consumers. If we look at the preamble toDSHEA, the important preamble to DSHEA, where Congress saidwe want healthful diets to mitigate the need for expensive medicalprocedures, then look at this regulation, they contradict each other. Now there are some people who would say that any structure function claim is an implied disease claim, that maintaining a goodcirculatory system is really a ''wink '' way of saying you 're going to prevent a heart attack. We do not believe that Congress shouldpermit this government to make that claim illegal because some-body thinks that it might be an implied drug claim. Now there aremany valid objections that have been filed in the 100,000 com-ments that Dr. Henney referred to. And I do want to say at thispoint that we are very encouraged that Dr. Henney has said thatshe believes that FDA has sufficient safety powers under DSHEA,a stance that contradicts her predecessors. And we think there arepeople at FDA now who exhibit the same attitude and we are hope-ful that this process can go forward in a very positive way. But let me just bring up four basic points about the structure function claim regs. First and foremost, FDA has put the word''normal '' back into section 6 by redefining disease. They say a dis- ease would have to be interpreted as any interruption or impair-ment of normal structure or function. We fought hard about thatword, Mr. Chairman, during the drafting of DSHEA and there werethose who tried to put the word normal into that law and Congressvery definitively kept it out. Putting the word normal in takes abroad-based health message to the consumer and cuts it down toa narrow area that won 't allow this industry to function properly. For that reason alone, we believe this proposed regulation is notproper. Second, the way that ''disease claim '' is defined can make almost any claim illegal. All the FDA has to do is get the affidavit of onehealth expert who says that in the opinion of the health expertcommunity or the health community, this claim implies a disease.To use an example before, maintaining good circulatory system, itis really for people with heart attacks; that implies a disease; thisis an illegal structure function claim. It is much too broad a defini-tion. We don 't think that the government should live with that defi- nition. Third, Congress said, we don 't want consumers to be fooled. We believe consumers have brains. If you put this disclaimer on thatsays this is not intended to treat, mitigate, or cure a disease and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May evaluated it, those words have meanings. It is right there on the label. What this proposal does is take away from con-sumers the right to make that judgment. It makes that disclaimermeaningless. It says, essentially, to consumers: I don 't care what you say on the label, what you read, if you have intelligence, wethink if we have a health expert who might imply a disease claimfrom this, you can 't get that information. We believe that is wrong as well. Finally, this claim, this proposed reg, contradicts in its breadth some of the recent first amendment decisions from the D.C. Circuit,including the Washington Legal Foundation of Pearson v. Shalala. And, for that reason as well, for first amendment reasons, we be-lieve there are serious issues with this regulation. We have two proposals to make today, as a solution. The first is\u2014and I have lived with this issue now for 7 years. I am aware of the complexities and I don 't treat this as a simplistic issue \u2014but I think that the only solution to this issue is a simple solution. Ibelieve that FDA should be entitled to repropose the regulation,but it should just draw a very simple line to begin with until Con-gress and FDA have more experience. And that is, if you mentiondisease, it is a drug. If you don 't mention disease, it is presumably a structure function claim. Let enforcement and an advisory bodytake it up after there. The main message that we have is that you have to retain a line. Pharmaceutical companies must be given the opportunity to haveprotection for huge, hundreds of millions of dollars in investments,for important drugs that save lives and cure disease. That is a veryimportant policy of Congress. On the other hand, Congress spokein DSHEA that the people who want to maintain their health, pre-vent disease, and stay out of the hospital, they also need informa-tion and they are not going to get that information if this proposedreg is enacted. We believe, therefore, that not only should FDA draw a simple line, but that the Congress should consider additional funds forFDA to enforce against the outliers, the people on the Internet yousee who are committing fraud, who don 't help the good people in this industry. The mainstream of this industry is bringing impor-tant information to consumers. They should be allowed to continueto do that. And, finally, Mr. Chairman, I propose that an advisory group, modeled perhaps on the American Association of Feed Control Offi-cials or International Milk Shippers, groups that contain govern-ment officials, academia, State officials, as well as academics andlawyers and provide nonbinding guidelines to FDA in the greyarea, so that we don 't have to sit here in oversight hearings for the next 10 years worrying about whether regulation overreaches.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Bass follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Bass. Mr. Kracov.Mr. K RACOV . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On behalf of my client, Pharmanex, Inc., I want to thank you for the opportunity to pro-vide testimony today regarding our experience in the Cholestinmatter. Our hope is that participating in this hearing will play aconstructive role in your oversight activities and in FDA 's evalua- tion of its policies with respect to dietary supplement products. Pharmanex, Inc., now a subsidiary of Nu Skin Enterprises of Provo Utah is a science-based company providing standardized die-tary supplement products bearing substantiated claims. In additionto assembling a first-class scientific team that includes experts inmedicine, nutrition, and natural product chemistry, Pharmanex in-vested enormous sums in research and development and put inplace manufacturing facilities that employ sophisticated qualitycontrol and quality assurance methods. Pharmanex, in essence,represents precisely what the Dietary Supplement Health and Edu-cation Act was intended to promote: a responsible company pro-viding quality products that benefit the health and well-being ofconsumers. Cholestin, one of Pharmanex 's products, is a natural dietary sup- plement that is composed solely of milled red yeast rice. Red yeastrice, which is a solid fermentation of yeast on rice, has a docu-mented history of use as both a food and health product going backalmost a millennium. The species of yeast in Cholestin was origi-nally identified scientifically in 1895 and it has a long history ofuse in the manufacture of red yeast rice, red sake, and other foodproducts that have long been available in the United States. In-deed, the earliest reported attempt to manufacture red yeast ricein the United States \u2014in 1920 \u2014was undertaken by Margaret Church, an employee of the Bureau of Chemistry, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, the direct predecessor to the Food and Drug Admin-istration. That effort used the very same yeast strain employed byPharmanex in making Cholestin. Some traditional red yeast rice products naturally contain a range of substances known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.These include, but are not limited to, lovastatin, as well as othernatural compounds that promote and maintain healthy cholesterollevels. In developing Cholestin as a dietary supplement product,Pharmanex sought to employ modern quality control methods inthe ancient recipe for red yeast rice in order to ensure that all ofthe beneficial constituents are consistently present. In addition,Pharmanex spent millions on clinical research to ensure the prod-uct is safe and beneficial. In spite of this, however, FDA took the position, both in an ad- ministrative proceeding and, subsequently, in the Pharmanex v. Shalala litigation, that Pharmanex 's Cholestin red yeast rice is a drug rather than a dietary supplement. According to the agency,Pharmanex, ''manipulated, '' the production process to ensure lovastatin content and, ''touted, '' the presence of lovastatin in the product. FDA did not challenge the safety of Cholestin. FDA 's legal case was built upon construing a phrase in section 201(ff)(3)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act asamended by DSHEA. This provision states that, ''an article that is VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 a new drug under section 505, '' of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act cannot be sold as a dietary supplement un-less marketed prior to that approval as a dietary supplement or asa food. The agency 's view was that Cholestin red yeast rice, a die- tary supplement form of a traditional food, could not be marketedbecause a synthesized drug product, Mevacor, contains the activeingredient lovastatin. Notably, the agency 's construction of this statutory provision was completely at odds with its historical inter-pretation of the term ''new drug approved under section 505 '' in- cluding an administrative decision issued in another matter as re-cently as December 1998. The agency 's theory was also at odds with the facts regarding Cholestin. Lovastatin is 1 of 10 HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors inCholestin, and the company does not control or even test for itslevel. Lovastatin varies from 20 to 60 percent of the total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in the product, which is actually com-posed mostly of rice. Pharmanex does not add or enhance any sin-gle constituent. Rather, Pharmanex has employed quality controlmeasures common to the food industry to standardize the overalllevel of beneficial constituents. Such standardization is preciselywhat Congress sought to encourage in DSHEA. Indeed, it is worth-while noting that, although Cholestin is simply ground red yeastrice, DSHEA specifically authorizes the use of metabolites, ex-tracts, and concentrates as dietary supplements. Moreover, rather than touting the lovastatin content of the prod- uct, the company has marketed the product as a natural dietarysupplement: a food. Indeed, a Federal judge in a trademark casespecifically found that Cholestin was not marketed as a drug anddid not compete with drug products. The agency 's case was built entirely upon a few Pharmanex references to lovastatin in the con-text of overviews of clinical research, and a tiny warning formerlyfound on the back label of the product. As to the historical marketing of red yeast rice containing lovastatin, even FDA 's own testing found that some other tradi- tional red yeast rice foods on market contained lovastatin, includ-ing one with a lovastatin level equal to 39 percent of that foundin Cholestin. Phamanex 's own comprehensive testing here and in China found traditional red yeast rice foods with more lovastatinthan in Cholestin. The presence of lovastatin, a food product likered yeast rice, is not that surprising. The ability to produce HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors has been found to be widespread amongfungi originating from different taxonomic groups and habitats. Forexample, lovastatin is found at high levels in a species of mush-room widely consumed in the United States. Fortunately, on February 16, 1999, the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah found for Pharmanex in the Pharmanex v. Shalala litigation, holding that Cholestin is, in fact, a dietary sup- plement. Nevertheless, FDA 's position with respect to Cholestin placed an enormous burden on the company, resulting in millions of dollars in lost equity value and marketing investments, as wellas significant litigation costs. Indeed, but for the district court 's earlier grant to Pharmanex of a preliminary injunction preventingFDA from initiating further detentions of Pharmanex 's red yeast VerDate 11-MAY-2000 it is quite possible that the company would have gone out of business entirely. For Pharmanex, the FDA 's position in the case has always been puzzling in that the company thought that it was a model for whatFDA would like in a dietary supplement company: strict qualitycontrols, extensive efforts to understand the nature and safety ofits products, and substantial investments in clinical studies. Thecompany always wondered why the matter was treated as an en-forcement case with an approach of ''detain imports and ask ques- tions later. '' Over the many months of back and forth with the agency, Pharmanex repeatedly suggested ways that the mattercould be resolved, but FDA seemed determined to stick to its initiallegal theory, rather than find a way to maintain consumer accessto what we believe is an important product. In the aftermath of this decision, we hope FDA will reexamine its policies in light of the intent of Congress in enacting DSHEA.That intent was quite clear: FDA should do everything possible toensure the availability of safe dietary supplement products. Regu-lation of these products should not be governed by a blind pre-sumption that pharmaceuticals should be protected at all cost. Sim-ply put, FDA needs to take dietary supplements seriously from apublic health promotion standpoint, and should foster companieslike Pharmanex that are willing to put funds into serious qualitycontrols and research. I know that my client continues to be willing to put this litiga- tion behind them to work closely with the agency to foster thegrowth of a research-based dietary supplement industry. Such co-operation would be a significant step toward promoting the publichealth, as Congress intended in DSHEA. Once again, on behalf ofPharmanex, Inc., thank you for this opportunity. [The prepared statement of Mr. Kracov follows:] VerDate Kracov. Dr. Croom. Mr. C ROOM . Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of this com- mittee. I am extremely honored to be given the opportunity to pro-vide testimony to the Committee on Government Reform. I think, as a way to simplify this, let me say that botanicals is what I am going to focus on, not all the things delineated inDSHEA, because I don 't know all the other things. That is not my specialty. But let me say that my original motivation over 20 yearsago was to say what could be a safe and effective and affordableand available part of primary health care throughout the world.And there is only one answer and that is botanical medicines, onlyone answer. Today the other critical issue is \u2014why my prepared testimony discusses so much science \u2014is that, in my experience, for many years, that I could see traditional healers using very safe and effec-tive therapies, however, they can never be translated into a broad-er cultural context without the scientific validation of those. With-out that scientific validation \u2014I will speak to a couple of issues that I heard raised today \u2014we don 't know what is reproducible and how much should you take, once we are beyond a mild tea. And somethings are physiologically potent; most, however, are not. As a mat-ter of fact, our biggest challenge is to say how can we have gentletherapies when science, like much else in the world, rewards quick,immediate, dramatic answers, not, I would say, wisdom and com-passion and gentleness that we all say we are about as some of usapproach middle-age crisis, but that is our real challenge. And our challenge that why I believe in science is to make a re- producible product so I can believe I get consistency or what I, too,would buy in the marketplace to treat myself, is it can all be an-swered without conflict and without war if we start having thisidea that there really is some value here. And let us study it andlet us build up the foundation of not only our health care. But, I am being very honest, that has not been part of this de- bate. The debate has always been, in recent times, the question ofregulation and of marketing and of corporate interest. Let usbroaden this whole discussion. Where is our health, our children 's health, and the world 's health? With that dedication, we can make changes. And that will come, working together in a cooperativeway. I, too, must comment. I was glad to hear more sense of coopera- tion. Because let me also say that over 20 years ago, my major pro-fessor said there would never be another new drug, even plant, de-rived, when I started graduate school. And, within 2 years, I wasfortunate enough to direct the production of a Chinese traditionalmedicine anti-malarial drug for clinical trials by World Health. He, too, had the same debate I heard today. Was it the warm water in the tea? Was it placebo? I had one advantage over mymajor professor. It was from being a Southerner, which we alwaysstudy our ancestors. And I grew up with the knowledge that mygreatgrandfather was a founding member of the North CarolinaPharmaceutical Association and a physician. He used herbal medi-cine in his constant practice. I did not believe it was all safe andeffective. I do not still believe that. But some of it was and it gotdismissed by the quickness of time we went for very what I would VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May and dramatic physiological results is what happened historically in this century. So I guess if I have a message to you, it is, yes, garlic and gin- seng and saw palmetto and St. John 's wort, many people have tried these. And many people have benefited. But, really, we have justbegun. We are like children who have just begun. So let us not askfor final answers today of where is all the science? Let us take thischallenge to say, what can we do? And I will respond to Raquel Welch 's comment. You know science and worrying about placebos, we sometimes forget the individual.And we all know whether it is something we eat. I will be honest.I will leave it out so I won 't have a trade association after me. But there are some foods I can 't eat that I feel horrible after eating them and other people don 't. I don 't sleep well. I don 't have the same energy level. Now we have to approach things scientificallythat way to say both you as an individual and as a group whathappens. And I will speak to that same experience with over 6 years I worked on producing Taxol from renewable yew needles. I havenever testified before Congress, but I heard one before. Because Istarted working to say how could we save the old-growth forest andhelp women 's lives, which is where this issue started. And, there- fore, what I found that was, after being official, let us face it, nomatter all the clinical, some individuals that are friends of minewho have had Taxol have been greatly helped and some have not.So let us not be naive about our own individual health. And my message, you can see today \u2014which I appreciate the faith in your staff and my colleagues here, because I can see Ididn't stick at all to my prepared testimony. But I understand you get to say both \u2014is that we can do this and that it is really just a beginning. There is science \u2014and there does need to be more science \u2014but science should always be in service to our health and not seen as some kind of bar for us having good health. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Croom follows:] VerDate Dr. Croom. Mr. McCaleb.Mr. M CCALEB . Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the com- mittee. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to address youtoday on the FDA 's handling of dietary supplement labeling issues. The Herb Research Foundation is a 15-year-old scientific organi- zation, nonprofit, tax-exempt organization, that compiles researchon botanicals and gives information for the education of the public,the media, scientists, health professionals, pharmacists, and so on.We have perhaps the best library of scientific journal article collec-tion in the country on the subject of herbal medicine and herbsused as dietary supplements. We have over 200,000 scientific arti-cles in our files and provided a lot of those articles to Members ofCongress during the debate over DSHEA. We have also provideda lot of the substantiation information for companies who want tomake scientifically substantiated structure function claims. I was also a member of the Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels, as you know, and, as part of that and through my 25-yearcareer in herbal products, I have studied and understood the regu-lation of dietary supplements and the debates over them for years.I followed a lot of the things that Scott Bass was talking about amoment ago. The FDA 's proposed rules under discussion today do appear to me to be an attempt to sort of turn back the clock to circumventthe will of Congress and of the people and to prevent the very typesof claims that DSHEA was written to allow. I believe DSHEA hasproduced very impressive public health benefits already. HRF isvery aware of the increasing volume and quality of scientific re-search because we track it daily. We receive stacks of articles everyweek on the latest research on botanicals used in health care. We have also witnessed a new public awareness in health and nutrition. Nobody wants to be a minimum-daily adult. People arenot looking for just the disease preventive effects of taking vitaminC to prevent scurvy. In fact, I would venture to guess that nobodytakes vitamin C to prevent scurvy any more. Rather, our conceptof nutrition and health now has expanded to the point that we un-derstand that certain types of foods and supplements can helpmaintain and promote and increase our health and, some peoplewould say, prevent disease. And I understand that there is some-times a fine line between those types of claims. In addition, the passage of DSHEA has increased the sophistica- tion in supplement formulation and created, I think, dramatic in-centives for research. We have not seen this level of research inthis country for many years on botanical products. In addition,technologically advanced companies created by the newly allowablesupplement claims are raising standards of quality in the industryand bringing much-needed research funding to academic institu-tions for high-quality American supplement research. DSHEA is producing just exactly the kinds of changes that we envisioned in supplement research, development, and use of dietarysupplements. A better-informed public is using the best-researchedsupplement ingredients to produce real gains in public health. It istime for the FDA to abandon its continuing battle against dietary VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May against the right of the public to access truthful information about the known effects of supplements. I am disturbed by the repeated misrepresentations made by the FDA alleging that supplements are unregulated, a word that hasappeared in nearly every magazine and newspaper story since thepassage of DSHEA on supplements. The FDA persists in allegingthat Congress jeopardized public health to appease the so-calledmultibillion-dollar supplement industry and that DSHEA exemptssupplements from government oversight. As we have heard today,none of these things is true. My specific objections to the proposed rules: the redefinition of disease. The FDA 's proposed definition would allow any deviation from a state of normal health to be considered disease. Armed withthat ability to broadly redefine disease, FDA could consider anyproduct which helps or which claims to help maintain normalhealth, a drug claim. Any deviation from perfect health could becalled a disease, even if that deviation is a normal part of aging. The Commission on Dietary Supplement Labels spent 2 years in careful consideration and often debate on regulation of supplementlabeling. Throughout this process, we assumed that the definitionof disease, drug, supplement, and food were not subject to changeexcept by Congress. Indeed, the FDA testified before us that theywere unable to change or interpret these definitions without an actof Congress. Now it seems the agency believes it has the power toradically alter the definition of disease and grant itself the powerto define anything as a drug. By the FDA definition, thirst is a dis-ease and drinking water a drug. Implied claims. The FDA has always wanted the authority to de- cide what is implied in claims. The Commission recognized the dif-ficulty of determining what is implied to a consumer by a par-ticular statement. Regulation must be based on what is stated ona label, not what a consumer reads into it. The FDA endorsed inits proposal this claim, ''Helps maintain cardiovascular function and a healthy circulatory system. '' One consumer reading that statement may conclude this helps keep my heart healthy, whileanother might think this can help me prevent heart disease. Themanufacturer cannot be held responsible for a statement being in-terpreted as a wellness claim by one and disease-prevention claimby another. The important point is that the public has a desire and a right to know about substances that can protect their health. Althoughheart disease can only be diagnosed by a doctor, every Americanwants to maintain a healthy heart. Citation of publications. The FDA proposes the citation of a title of a publication or other reference could cause a supplement to beregulated as a drug if the publication or article named a disease.This would restrict the ability of supplement producers to informthe public of even the best quality of research, citing even theworks of the National Cancer Institute and other health agencies,respected journals, and other high-quality sources of consumer edu-cation. VerDate the FDA 's proposed rules should be withdrawn and re- drafted with the serious intent to carry out the will of Congressand of the public. The current proposal appears to be a stubbornattempt to reverse the major provisions of DSHEA and preventmost statements of nutritional support. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. McCaleb follows:] VerDate Mr. Turner.Mr. T URNER . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is James Turner and I am the chairman of the board of Citizens for Health.Citizens for Health generated about 1 million letters to Congressto support DSHEA. It has also been involved as one of the plain-tiffs in the Pearson case, which was recently decided by the courthere in the District against the FDA. Also, last September, it gen-erated not 100, but over 175,000 letters to the FDA complainingabout the structure function regulation that was put forward bythe FDA. Our concern about the structure function claim was underlined by the Commissioner 's statements this morning. Just as she was slightly off on the 100,000 versus 175,000 names, she was slightlyoff on what the situation is with regard to the proposed regulation.She said that the FDA wanted to look at a bunch of medical booksto find out what the definition of disease was so that they couldthen decide how properly to regulate the disease aspects of the law. What she did not say is that FDA has in place a definition of dis- ease by regulation which was in place at the time that DSHEA waspassed and it is quite different than the one that they are currentlyproposing. That regulation says that disease is some damage to abodily organ, heart, structure, or system which impairs its function,such as cardiovascular disease. The argument that Citizens forHealth has made is that that definition should not be changed.Changing that definition completely essentially repeals the struc-ture function aspects of DSHEA. It eliminates the ability to makethe kinds of claims that the law was designed to pass. We are prepared at Citizens for Health. We have already mount- ed a campaign of 175,000 letters. That is how many they havecounted. They are still counting. We are prepared to go to courtand argue that the intent of Congress, when the bill was passed,was to recognize by law the definition that FDA had in place atthat time, that, as a matter of law, the definition that existed atthat time was the definition that Congress put into the act. We have one minor recommendation to Congress in the future. When taking an action of the kind that they did in DSHEA, prob-ably the exact language of such definitions should be written intothe legislation. I have been working on food and drug law since1968. I was involved in the passage of the Proxmire Act, NLEA,and DSHEA. Every time Congress has moved forward to makemore information available to the public about dietary supple-ments, the FDA has moved backward and tried to undo that actionby their regulatory efforts. The FDA, for some reason, seems to beinstitutionally incapable of having an open mind about the inter-ests of the public about the consumer having information abouthow to make their own health decisions. In pursuing this desire \u2014wherever the desire comes from \u2014to keep rolling back these acts of Congress, it also \u2014I don 't want to say misleads \u2014but it certainly leads Congress off in ancillary direc- tions. This discussion, for example, this morning about looking inmedical books for the definition of disease is completely off-pointabout the issue. As I have said, the issue is that a definition exists.Congress passed a law fully cognizant of that definition existing. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 the FDA wants to change that definition. They have pro- vided absolutely zero information as to why that definition shouldbe changed. Incidentally, they have also provided no legal basisupon which they could change that definition. They have undertaken the same kinds of activities in several other areas which are in our written testimony, which we submitfor the record, and, hopefully, it will be published in the final docu-ment of the hearing today. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Mr. Turner follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Turner. Dr. Dickinson.Ms. D ICKINSON . Thank you and we do appreciate the opportunity to be here to comment on FDA 's implementation of DSHEA. The Council for Responsible Nutrition is a trade association rep- resenting the dietary supplement industry. Our hundred manufac-turing companies are responsible for producing most of the dietarysupplements that are currently available to you in health foodstores, supermarkets, drug stores, by direct sales, and by mailorder. We were intimately involved in the bipartisan effort to passDSHEA by 1994 and have been monitoring every step of FDA andcongressional implementation of that law. We believe that DSHEA strikes exactly the balance that Mr. Burton and Mr. Waxman spoke of this morning, that is the balancebetween protecting consumer access to products that they want toimprove their health and also allowing FDA ample authority to en-force the requirement that the products be safe and that the prod-ucts be appropriately labeled and that any statements on the labelbe substantiated. We believe DSHEA quite intentionally allowsthat balance to be struck. We think the most damaging thing that is happening today that could endanger DSHEA and endanger the industry is the wide-spread perception that is being spread by the media and, some-times, supported by some individuals even within the regulatoryagencies that these products are unregulated. It would be bad forindustry, it would be bad for consumers if, indeed, these productswere unregulated. But they are not. FDA has authority over thesafety of these products and DSHEA specifically spells out proce-dures to be followed before a new ingredient can be introduced ina dietary supplement. It also gives FDA ample authority to with-draw or seize products that are found to be unsafe and CRN sup-ports these procedures. We think the only thing that could be done that would be better in terms of making DSHEA better would be for FDA to step up tothe plate to its duties in the way of enforcement. We think thatcompanies who are trying to do the right thing are not well-servedby an agency that does not enforce the requirement that state-ments on the label be truthful, not misleading, and substantiated.Nor are they supported, nor are they helped by an agency thatdoesn 't take swift action when there are issues of safety to be ad- dressed. Recently FDA seems to be moving in the direction of being some- what more active in these areas. For example, they have been re-viewing the 75-day notices for new ingredients that are requiredunder DSHEA and, just this year, they moved against a productcalled GBL, which they had already determined to be unsafe, butwas being marketed anyway. CRN supported that action and wewould continue to support FDA actions in the interest of assuringthe safety of products that are available to consumers. Our written testimony addresses other areas where CRN and other members of the industry have supported FDA action, whichunfortunately has been slower in coming than it should be, for ex-ample, in the area of finalizing good manufacturing practices,which DSHEA recognized are essential to assure the quality of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May to consumers. Also, there needs to be extensive improvements in FDA 's current handling of adverse event report- ing for nutritional supplement products. There needs to be a die-tary supplement advisory committee established for FDA. FDA cur-rently relies on its Food Advisory Committee, which, unfortunately,does not have the kinds of individuals, the kind of expertise, rep-resented on it that it needs in order to address dietary supplementissues. On the issue of the current proposal of FDA on statements of nu- tritional support, CRN has submitted extensive comments to FDAcriticizing virtually every element of that proposal. FDA recognizesin its preamble that there is very little difference between pro-moting health and preventing disease and that almost any diseaseclaim can be stated as a statement supporting structure or functionof the body. We think that this very recognition by FDA underlineswhat is wrong with the current structure function proposal. Congress drew the only bright line that can be drawn between permissible statements of nutritional support and disease claimswhen Congress said in DSHEA that a statement of nutritional sup-port may not mention a disease or related condition nor may it usethe kinds of terms that are embodied in the drug definition, suchas prevent, treat, cure, mitigate. Beyond that, the act clearly antici-pates that any statement that, on its face, is a statement about af-fecting structure and function should be permitted under DSHEA.Once FDA leaves that solid ground and launches off into trying todraw another line between statements of nutritional support thatmay be implied disease claims and statements that may not, we be-lieve they enter an area where there really is no logical line thatcan be drawn. For example, in the proposal, FDA says that it is quite OK if you say, as a statement of nutritional support, that a product main-tains a healthy cholesterol level or that it maintains a healthyheart. We would agree with that statement. However they also saythat it would not be an acceptable claim if you say a product lowerscholesterol. What do you think people believe maintaining ahealthy cholesterol means? They obviously think it means havinga lower cholesterol. So FDA is trying in this case to draw an inde-fensible line between what they would consider to be an impliedstatement and a disease claim. We believe that all of these state-ments should rightly be permitted as statements of nutritional sup-port regarding effect on the structure and function of the body. The FDA proposal would even prevent the provision of adequate information to consumers regarding the research basis for some ofthese statements. As Robert McCaleb mentioned, the proposalwould prevent manufacturers, in labeling \u2014and remember that the rule applies to labeling as well as to labels, so informational bro-chures that are prepared by the company and distributed with theproduct would have to comply with this rule \u2014it forbids the citation of articles that contain the mention of a disease. CRN published a statement on benefits of nutritional supple- ments early last year citing almost 200 references. And we wentback and checked how many of those have the name of a diseasein the title of the article and it is more than 50 percent. One couldnot do a competent review of the science on any subject related to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May mentioning such articles. So we are very concerned about that aspect. CRN believes that FDA would do well to follow the USDA model in this case. When USDA published an organic rule that washugely opposed by consumers and on which they also got morethan 200,000 letters, the Secretary stood up to the bar and said,OK, we got it wrong. We are going to withdraw this regulation. Weare going to go back to the drawing board and reconsider what isneeded. We think that should be FDA 's response also in this case. In general, our philosophy in dealing with FDA is to try to co- operate for the betterment of FDA and the industry and we areglad to hear Dr. Henney say that, under FDAMA with its instruc-tion to FDA to deal more directly with its stakeholders, that theyare going to work with us more closely. We look forward to workingboth with you and with FDA to resolve these issues. [The prepared statement of Ms. Dickinson follows:] VerDate Gilhooley.Ms. G ILHOOLEY . I am Margaret Gilhooley. I am a professor at Seton Hall Law School and was a member of the Commission onDietary Supplement Labels. I appreciate the opportunity to testifyon DSHEA and whether FDA is carrying out its intent. I will first address the criteria to identify disease claims. DSHEA permits dietary supplements to make structure and functionclaims, but not disease claims. Under FDA 's proposed rules, dis- ease claims include references to specific diseases, but not moregeneral references to body systems or functions. Thus, FDA ten-tatively regards as appropriate a claim that a supplement helpsmaintain cardiovascular function, inhibits platelet aggregation, andhelps maintain a healthy cholesterol level. I believe FDA 's criteria are too narrow. General references to bodily functions can still imply usefulness to prevent disease condi-tions and especially so when the claim refers to bodily organs andfunctions that normally receive medical attention. The Commissionmembers disagreed about appropriate claims for supplements andsome of us found troubling and problematic claims mentioning or-gans such as the heart or systems such as the circulatory systemassociated with major clinical conditions. In my view, a claim to maintain normal cardiovascular function implies a need to use the product to prevent an abnormality, an ab-normality which would be a disease. Moreover, when a claim re-lates to a matter beyond the ability of the consumer to assess fromtheir own experience, the potential to mislead increases. Thus, Ithink the FDA proposal needs to be revised. The FDA proposal also recognizes as an appropriate structure and function statement a claim that a product improves absent-mindedness. In my view, this claim should not be viewed as an ap-propriate claim for a dietary ingredient. There are no foods that af-fect absentmindedness and this claim is not for the role of a dietaryingredient or a dietary supplement in any meaningful sense. Thatclaim should not be permissible for the same reason that a claimof a dietary supplement to be an oral contraceptive would not bepermissible. The claim is simply not one for the affects of a dietaryingredient. With respect to health claims, the Commission found that the standard of significant scientific agreement is appropriate andserves the public interest and that the process for approval ofhealth claims should be same for dietary supplements and conven-tional foods. While FDA has adopted this approach, the recent deci-sion by the D.C. Circuit of Appeal in Pearson v. Shalala has found constitutional and legal difficulties with FDA 's actions. Under the decision, the FDA regulations are unconstitutional in failing toallow supplements to make a health claim, even when there is nosignificant scientific agreement to support the claim, so long as thesupplement bears a disclaimer about the inconclusiveness or otherlimits of the supporting evidence and the lack of FDA approval. I will not comment about the constitutional law aspects of the de- cision, but will point out the important decision FDA will have tomake on remand in determining what constitutes an adequate dis-claimer to inform consumers with respect to particular health VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May addition to the other disclaimers, consider- ation needs to be given to stating on the label that there is no sig-nificant scientific agreement to support the claim. The difficultiesof using disclaimers to inform consumers is also illustrated by theNational Cancer Institute 's study of the affects of the antioxidant supplement beta carotene. The Institute 's investigators found in two studies that the supplements were clearly not effective to pre-vent cancer or heart disease and may even be harmful. Disclaimers may simply not be adequate to convey this informa- tion on the label. Moreover, even under the court 's decision, pre- clusion of a claim, rather than a disclaimer, may be appropriatewhen the weight of the evidence shows the claim to be ineffective. With respect to safety substantiation, consumers use dietary sup- plements because they assume the supplements are safe, as safe asfoods. The supplements are not, however, subject to the require-ments for general recognition or FDA approval that provides assur-ance of the safety of other ingredients. FDA bears the burden ofproof to show that the product poses a significant risk. And theCommission report also indicates the difficulties and resource bur-dens involved in meeting that standard. In my view, supplementmanufacturers should have a legally enforceable affirmative obliga-tion to do the testing needed to establish that supplements aresafe. I think that responsible manufacturers will do that and it isreally only the irresponsible manufacturers who will evade that ob-ligation and may bring discredit to the dietary supplement indus-try. If a manufacturer does not do safety testing, the manufacturer should put a warning on the label that the safety of the supple-ment has not been substantiated. I recommended in the Commis-sion report that FDA require this warning to prevent deception,but FDA has not acted on that measure. Finally, there is debate about whether FDA is carrying out the intent of DSHEA. But the underlying reason why it is hard to re-solve that issue is because DSHEA is an enigma. The provisionsare ambiguous and can be interpreted in various ways. Thus, whileI believe FDA can and should do more to guard against inappro-priate claims, I recognize that not all will agree that FDA has thatauthority under DSHEA. And if FDA does not have this authority,in my view, Congress should revisit DSHEA and provide clear cri-teria to limit inappropriate claims and give FDA stronger authorityto assure the safety supplements. Thank you for the opportunity totestify. [The prepared statement of Ms. Gilhooley. I have a number of com- ments and questions. I think, Mr. Bass, you suggested that thereought to be an advisory panel on this whole issue to at least workwith the head of the FDA. And, toward that end, we will contactthe new Commissioner and suggest that we think that might be agood idea. It is not binding, but it would help, maybe, illuminatesome of the issues and problems so that they could be solved with-out regulations being proposed before all sides have been heard. Sowe will suggest that and we will contact her by mail and in personabout that. Mr. Kracov, regarding Cholestin, you made some inferences \u2014I am not sure I read you correctly \u2014but you were talking about lovastatin and I think \u2014was it Merck that produces lovastatin? Mr. K RACOV . That is correct. Mr. B URTON . Yes. Do you believe or did I read in your remarks that possibly some of the pharmaceutical companies may be in-volved in trying to stop some of these supplements that may takeaway some of their business? Mr. K RACOV . I agree and disagree in that at least one pharma- ceutical company was interested in stopping our particular product.But, in general, one of the ironies of the Cholestin case is that FDAwas supposedly protecting incentives to develop pharmaceuticalproducts, but neither the pharmaceuticals industry association orany other pharmaceutical company commented in the docketagainst Pharmanex. And, indeed, the only other pharmaceuticalcompany that commented actually supported our position on cho-lesterol claims for the product. Mr. B URTON . Do any of you believe that the pharmaceutical in- dustry has, behind the scenes, tried to influence people at the FDAor any government agency regarding the stopping of certain supple-ments from being marketed? Do you have any idea? Mr. T URNER . That is a very tough question to answer because the evidence is not right there in the record. But I have been in-volved with the herbal sweetener Stevia for a number of years andwe know that FDA has restricted its access into the United States.We know that there has been industry complaints from other in-dustries about it. We don 't know really who they are. And we know that it competes directly with Nutrasweet. There is a buzz aroundthat there is some role that Nutrasweet plays in helping the FDAnot allow this sweetener to be widely distributed. Now the way itworks, once DSHEA was passed, the products could continue to besold, it could be sold, but it just can 't be labeled as a sweetener. Mr. B URTON . Do any of you have knowledge or information that people who work at the FDA, Health and Human Services, the Na-tional Cancer Institute, or National Institutes of Health, have beeninfluenced by pharmaceutical companies in their decision or the de-cisionmaking process over there at any of those institutions? Mr. K RACOV . I can comment that in the Pharmanex administra- tive proceeding, there was extensive involvement by one pharma- ceutical company in particular and there was significant \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . What was that company? Mr. K RACOV . It was the maker of Merck. Mr. B URTON . Merck. VerDate information provided to the docket was ob- viously, heavily weighted or attempted to weight the case againstPharmanex. Fortunately, we were able to rebut that and go tocourt and win. I think that is unusual. I think, actually, if you lookat the products that are on the table here, many of those dietarysupplement products are made by pharmaceutical companies. Mr. B URTON . Oh, yes. Mr. K RACOV . And I think a lot of those companies are actually seeing the promise of the Dietary Supplement Health and Edu-cation Act and are taking advantage of it. Mr. B URTON . Well, you know, I know that is the case because it is a burgeoning industry. And people are more concerned abouttheir health and, as a result, I think a lot of the pharmaceuticalcompanies are seeing additional marketing that they can do, addi-tional products that they can market and make money. Which isfine. The line of questioning I am taking right now is, I don 't believe that any industry, even though they have a lot of money at riskbecause of scientific research into certain products, should try to in-fluence government agencies for their benefit while, at the sametime, it is to the detriment of another industry and, ultimately,maybe, to the American people. And that is why I asked that ques-tion. I understand \u2014and I think Mr. Bass mentioned this in his com- ments \u2014pharmaceutical companies invest millions, billions of dol- lars, in research and we want to make sure that they don 't go out of business because they spend a lot of money on research and thenthey can 't recoup that by selling their product, you know, through having control of that product for a long period of time. But, at thesame time, if somebody comes up with a less expensive approachto, curing a form of cancer, I think it is unseemly for the pharma-ceutical industry to come in and say, hey, we want to stop that andtry to use our influence with a governmental agency to do so. Andthat is why I ask that question. And if any of you have any indication that some person at any of these agencies are ever being unduly influenced or influenced atall by somebody in one of these industries or one of these compa-nies, I wish you would bring it to my attention because I would cer-tainly like to pursue that. OK? I think, Dr. Croom, you talked about placebos and one of the con- cerns that I have had, we have had a number of people testify be-fore our committee who have had Hodgkin 's disease or had children who were terminally ill with lymphoma or some other disease andthere have been alternative therapies that have been proposed bycertain doctors in other parts of the country. And I believe it wasHealth and Human Services that have said that, you know, thesearen 't proven therapies as far as they are concerned. And, as a re- sult, they told these doctors, if they used their procedures on theindividuals who testified before our committee, that they could losetheir license to practice medicine. And the ultimate result was that these people had no hope. They had been adjudged terminally ill and the parents of the boy thatwas in question and another fellow who had Hodgkin 's disease, they were told, in essence, go home and die. They didn 't say it just VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 go home and die. And that the possi- bility that these alternative therapies used by other doctors hadnot yet been proven to the satisfaction of these government agen-cies meant that the people couldn 't go down there and pursue that therapy. I also was concerned because we had people who wanted to have therapies and they were told that there was trials being under-taken and that they had to either take a placebo or take a productunder question. And they really were terminally ill and they didn 't want to take the placebo, they wanted to try the therapy that theythought would save their life. So I would like you to comment on that real briefly, if you would.Mr. C ROOM . I would be glad to. I have faced those same ques- tions, obviously, from family and friends. I am really hoping we areon a new beginning. And I am going to say it is \u2014I had a sentence written I guess I didn 't read \u2014and I say we must ask what is the health outcome of our public policies and scientific studies on theenhancement \u2014and I would take it to just what you asked. Not just botanicals. In other words, if I say to you, I haven 't studied it, but I am not going to give you money to study it. And, believe me, I have hadpeople at a number of alternative cancer therapies who have askedme, over the last year, to help them design the clinical trials be-cause they involved botanical products. Quite honestly, at thispoint, there has not been sufficient funding \u2014and I am talking about \u2014my job is not to do the clinical trial, my job is to say what is that optimum product you are using? What is the purity andidentity and standard? We haven 't backed up and asked that ques- tion and funded that research yet. Because, again, of course, I want to be the same way. I have friends who have gone to Switzerland for therapy from Oxford, MS.I have friends who have gone to Mexico. And people come to meand I have to say, you know, you have just pointed out a problem.Of course, I would rather have faith that something is happeningto me. It is a well-known case that if I tell you you are going todie, you are more likely to die if people tell you that every day. Andthat is an absolute \u2014I am sorry \u2014transgression of medical ethics to tell you that. To say that is unproven, I think, is not. In all honesty, there are so many things like this that touch all our lives, that I am saying to you that, and I agree. And, believeme, 16 years ago, when I became a professor and was doing botan-ical medicines, I started doing the anti-malarial and then the drugones because no one would fund our research and business was giv-ing us incentive. But you can tell me, Chairman Burton, if you would approach it differently, but I don 't have that same honest answer. I want to know that a person is competent and compassionate about thetherapy that I can trust the results they tell me, to say who wouldthis help and who it would not help and know that answer. Be-cause, right now, I don 't think, in many cases, we know. And I think in other cases \u2014and I will respond to some of the things \u2014we have asked certain high standards to just tell you you areunproven and you are foolish to do it. And you will never evenknow if it helped you, you know, even if you did it. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May that is just arrogance. And that is my plea, is to say let us have some humility and get the knowledge base. I hope that isresponsive to your question. Mr. B URTON . Well, I guess to a degree it is. I will yield to my colleague in just a moment. But we have had some severe cancerproblems in my family in the last year. My mother and father bothdied of cancer within a month of one another. My wife had breastcancer 5 years ago and she was given about a 50 percent chanceto survive 5 years. You know, they always use these statistics. Andwe were putting her into a special cancer program that I readabout where they stimulate your immune system. It was in High-land Park, IL. I had read about it in Life magazine, I believe. They were going to close that down after I brought it to the at- tention of the FDA, because I thought it should be expanded be-cause they were only working on about 72 women. And it reallybothered me a great deal because these women were calling me, be-cause of my position in the Congress, in the middle of the night,crying saying, you know, this is our only hope. And then these people that have testified before our committee over the last year, who had terminal illness had been adjudged ter-minal. And some of them had had miraculous results by going toa physician who was practicing and offering alternative therapies.And, yet, those physicians were threatened with the loss of theirlicenses, as were the physicians up in Highland Park where theywere going to close the program down, because they said that ei-ther they hadn 't had all the paperwork done or it hadn 't been prov- en to the satisfaction of the governing agencies. And so I guess my concern is, if a person whose life is in jeop- ardy, if their life has been threatened, if they have been adjudgedto be terminal or they have a 50 -50 chance to live over a certain period of time, shouldn 't they have the opportunity to try anything that they really want to to save their lives? And should governmentagencies preclude that possibility by saying if a doctor who has analternative therapy that they believe works or has worked on somepatients and hasn 't been proven to the satisfaction of the govern- ment agencies, should the government be able to stop that personfrom trying that therapy? And that is, I think, something that allAmericans would really be concerned about if it was their life. And I will tell you \u2014I don 't want to make a big long speech out of this \u2014but we had the former head of HHS, who was a friend of mine, I served with him in the Indiana General Assembly, he wasspeaker of the house there, that was Dr. Boehm. Dr. Boehm is avery fine man and a great physician. We had alternative therapiesand procedures we talked about in the Indiana General Assemblywhen I was in the legislature there. And he, supporting the AMA 's position and other 's positions, was dead set against those alter- natives. I understand that. We had hundreds of cancer patientswho wanted to try these alternative therapies back in those days.His wife ultimately became terminally ill with cancer and it is my understanding that he tried some of the alternative therapies thathad not been proven but had been turned down and looked uponwith disdain by these agencies, the same as what we were talkingabout. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 I am trying to make is, when it is your life, when it is your loved one 's life, when it is someone else 's life in your family that is at stake, you want to do everything you can to save them.And for a government agency to be so callous as to say, hey, thathasn 't been proven, you are terminally ill or judged terminally ill, should that agency be able to say, if a doctor tries to provide thisalternative therapy, we are going to take away his license, thusclosing the door to that person 's only alternative to live? I person- ally don 't think they should. Mr. C ROOM . And, because I actually live with people who are doing this, I am trying to give you a fair answer instead of maybequite as direct of what I hear you saying, but let me put it thisway. Again the parallel is alternative therapy. Once I am at a reg-ular hospital, do you realize how much you have put me in thefringe and I am seen as not a legitimate physician or scientist, onceyou call me that? And that is why I am calling to remove all theemotional issues and get down to the health issues, is to say, ofcourse, I have had friends who I won 't describe the therapies I have seen official medicine to do them for their cancers, that werehorrendous. Mr. B URTON . Sure. Mr. C ROOM . That were absolutely horrendous. And, yet, the same highest level institutions, if we go and ask this very question youare\u2014and I am saying the way that will turn that around is to say, then, let us say to our most prestigious places, we want you toevaluate this and then you remove all the conflict. You remove allthe conflict. But my point to you is, like anything that I have found, including in science, you need to have someone that is unbiased and an ex-pert, but also is enough of \u2014I would still say \u2014a person who would be very careful and fair in the results. It does not come in a priori,either way. So you can question that. Because I have those sameexperiences and I guess that is what I am pleading with you. Look,I have been asked by the Canadian Government to evaluateESSIAC, for example, type therapies or Hocksy remedies in Mexico. And I am being honest with you, I left it in the background be- cause I figure most people don 't worry the details like I do. I am the opposite of the don 't worry, make money. I worry, don 't make money. And so, there are a huge amount of things to actually doit right is why I left it in the checklist in the last of my testimony.And, believe me, my personal experience is with things like cancer.That is how thorough I want to be. I will give you a simple answer. We could say there is this Chi- nese medicinal plant that cured malaria. Isn 't that enough? And we have given it to some people and they made a tea and it cured theirmalaria. Well, I am going to tell you, that is what the armythought. And, instead, I went and collected all kinds of plant lines,got material from where it was originally used in China. It wasonly that plant material, only that genetic line. The stuff here onthe Potomac was worthless. You could have taken the tea all daylong and you would have still died, then, from malaria. So my point is the same with your cancer and our other serious things. I have family members that have had Alzheimer 's or Par- kinson 's, all this. There is another way. We keep debating this. But VerDate 11-MAY-2000 15:45 May also say, I want to see Congress encourage how can we have \u2014there are actually botanicals that should go IND NDA routes. Nothing has come out the other end of that door. So, again,my criteria is safe, effective, affordable, and available. And if younever make it available to me, then, just like yours, I have createdan undoable situation. Because I believe we have things that willhelp on not only cancer, but neuroprotection and other serious dis-eases. And some of those, let me say, need to be under a direct phy-sician 's care. So I hope I am understanding your mission and I appreciate the opportunity. That is why I am going to leave you with that. Youhave many opportunities. It is a great \u2014I would just have to say blessing \u2014to see what you are having this committee do. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Horn. Mr. H ORN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I commend you for holding this series of hearings on alternative medicines and al-ternative therapies and other aspects of our health care in the Na-tion. Let me start with you if I might, Dr. Croom. I am curious ifyou could put together a research focus, what supplements wouldyou feel deserve that attention at this point, that are, perhaps, incommon use and what hasn 't been done in terms of examining them along the lines you are talking about? Mr. C ROOM . I may later give you a handout I just did at Harvard that will be there for continuing medical education, I guess. Iwould say \u2014\u2014 Mr. H ORN. Well, we can put that in the record, if you would like. Without objection, Mr. Chairman. Mr. C ROOM . OK. We could do that. Miss Clay has that. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 . Specifically, let me understand your question. I must say that I refrained from this because I was getting concerned thateverybody would just want to pick my brain to say that now if Ihave an enlarged prostate, is there anything to supplement, pump-kin seed or what? But I will say, yes. Mr. H ORN. Well, I mean, you have come into contact with a lot of people. They have a lot of suggestions. They feel some of it hasdone well by them. And, in terms of the research approach, whichareas that seem to have a high demand and use by people, is therea way you can develop a protocol that research could be done andto see if it really is, is it chance? Is it just psychology or what? Mr. C ROOM . I think you will see there are a number of the prod- ucts I think we already know. For example, like saw palmetto andSt. John 's wort, that have enough evidence that I would say that a number of people are going to benefit, OK, from it. And, cer-tainly, whether you are taking it to just have a mood elevator orfor mild depression, you are going to feel better. A lot of peoplehave a safer therapy with that. If you are asking how we would do a research prioritization, ac- tually, some of mine that I have commented on is not just selectedproducts. I will be glad to get that back to you. I would love to. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 . Part of my focus is to say things just as have been addressed here. I have been on the FDA working group on GMPs.We need to increase our knowledge of product definition and getthat over with. What are we buying? What makes good quality andconsistency products? That is the first step, I think. I think thereare a number of significant things that, again, I would say that ifwe broadened it to where it was not thought of as alternative andI am going to be involved in a NIH conference on liver diseases,for example. It is starting to progress. If you as Congressmen just say to NIH, these are serious and you help us get these answers, they are the experts that know what arethe best liver diseases or worst for retrieval kidney. If those guysask us that, then I say we take it one at a time, like these comeand say what are our best shots, what do we develop? I think thatis the most rational approach, instead of giving you a total check-list. Is that all right? Mr. H ORN. Well, it is a start. I wonder if any other members of the panel will answer that question? Mr. McCaleb. Mr. M CCALEB . Mr. Chairman, if I could comment on that subject, I think a rational strategy for deciding what to study first is totake those things where we have the greatest chance of success inresearch, those studies that \u2014those botanicals that have been well- studied in European studies, but in which American physicians aresaying we need to replicate those in American studies. I ampleased to see the NIH is doing this with respect to St. John 's wort. I think we will probably find that is effective. A few more of thoseto confirm that the results of European research are valid andmaybe we can start following the European lead in looking at thebest researched of the European phytomedicines and researchingthose in I would say a priority order according to what will havethe greatest public health impact. I appreciate your mentioning the immune stimulation approach to treating cancer. And, for so many years, medical science hasbeen locked into a pattern of testing anti substances. That is, wehad antibiotics. We have antivirals. We have antitumor agents andso on. Immune stimulants or substances that work with our bodiesto help our own immune systems work more effectively against dis-ease and that is a part of a wellness approach that I think is goingto yield very great public benefits for us. Mr. T URNER . I think there is an additional point that should be made and that is that, in addition to the scientific strategy, thereshould be a legal policy strategy that goes along with it, specificallyin areas where there is not a safety question. The period of timethat it takes us to gather the information about a new substanceshould be a time in which consumers can have access to that sub-stance while the decision is being made. And there are many situa-tions in which we are held back because the FDA and other regu-lators take the position that, until we know and can prove that asubstance is, ''effective, '' then we should not allow consumers to have access to it. I believe that this is a misreading of the efficacy amendments to the law. When they were made in 1962, it said that there shouldbe substantial evidence to support efficacy. Substantial evidencetraditionally means more than a scintilla, but less than a prepon- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 What the law was designed to do was to op- pose fakery or quackery and make claim for something for whichthere was no evidence, for which there was not a scintilla. The pub-lic policy change that would address the point that you were mak-ing is to allow people to have access to situations that are sup-ported by emerging science that is more than a scintilla, that issome evidence, but not necessarily enough to establish efficacy. My belief is that if we could establish that kind of an approach, we would create a framework for providing social support behindthe kind of science that our two scientists here have been describ-ing. Mr. H ORN. Anybody else on the panel want to comment on that question? Ms. Gilhooley. Ms. G ILHOOLEY . To the extent that this relates to products that would be sold as drugs with the AIDS crisis FDA has changed itspolicy and Congress has enacted a program for fast-track approvalof drugs that deal with life-threatening and serious conditions. Butthe manufacturer still has to be in the process of doing adequate,well-controlled studies and complete them afterwards. Mr. H ORN. I think a lot of people have felt that if you are termi- nally ill, what is wrong with trying it. And the people of Californiashowed by a majority vote that if you are terminally ill, you havepain, in the case of many cancer victims, that you should be al-lowed to use marijuana. That is a very rational decision for people. Ms. G ILHOOLEY . I had a comment on the question before about people who are terminally ill who want to use products and maybealternatives out of the hope that it will help them. And maybethere really isn 't any scientific evidence for it. That came up with laetrile. It is a long-time issue. It is a very compelling dilemma.But there is also a concern not to have people spend all their lastmoney and be taken in by people. I teach a food and drug course and one of the students in my class who is a doctor gave me a copy of New Jersey 's provision on laetrile, which is a provision to allow doctors to administer laetrile,as long as there is a limit on their making more money out of itand charging more than they would for their regular payments.And I could supply that to the committee, if you would like. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 ORN. I enjoyed reading your testimony. I have got to ask you a personal question. I knew a Gilhooley in a previous incarna-tion and are you any relation to the great Gilhooley who was As-sistant Secretary of Labor under President Eisenhower? He wasalso a lawyer. Ms. G ILHOOLEY . I believe he might be a distant cousin. I think all of the Gilhooley 's come from Leitrim way back in Ireland. We are all cousins. Mr. H ORN. And they all became lawyers, right? [Laughter.] Well, I come from the Malones and the McCaffreys and the McSherries and they all have lawyers as the second cousins afterthe first cousins make it. So I just wondered. He was a very ablepublic servant. Thank you very much. We appreciate all your testi-mony. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Horn, for that view into your ances- try. I really appreciate that. [Laughter.] A lot of lawyers?Mr. H ORN. That is right. I am not one of them. Mr. B URTON . Well, how did you become a university president? Mr. H ORN. Well, I am not one of them and my son, who every- body expected to go to law school says, dad, if I go, I want to justbe a prosecutor. [Laughter.] Mr. B URTON . OK. Well, let me just end it by saying to all of you I really appreciate your testimony today. I think it has been a realservice for the country and people are watching across the country.And, hopefully, it will give us some guidance in Congress on howto deal with these problems. And it will also help us in our workwith the Food and Drug Administration and other health agenciesin this country. And I hope you will all stay in touch with me, eventhose who disagree with me. I would really like to have as muchinput as possible so that we can make sure that this committee,which has oversight responsibilities over a lot of these areas, doesits job well. Thank you very much. This committee stands adjourned.[Whereupon, at 2:28 p.m., the committee was adjourned.][Additional information submitted for the hearing record follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 "}
