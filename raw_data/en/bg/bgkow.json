What crystal(s) are good for boosting the immune system? Should I also use a clear quartz when I pray for healthy immune system? Crystals are so wonderful I truly wish I would have found them years ago. Thank you for your help. I do have another question... when I am meditating with my crystals, should I hold them in my dominant hand or the other hand?
