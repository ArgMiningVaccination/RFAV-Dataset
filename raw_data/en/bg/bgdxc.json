Holistic Ayurveda, Detox, Health, Yoga, Mind and More SPRING February to June SUMMER & AUTUMN June to October WINTER October to February The Doshas Ayurvedic philosophy is based on the [Doshas](https://www.mandira-ayurveda.at/en/ayurvedic-constitutional-type/), the three vital energies that are present in all human beings. We distinguish between three basic constitutional types: Vata, Pitta and Kapha, but most of us are a mixture of them all. Pulse diagnosis and a thorough consultation are precursors to determining a person's Dosha composition. The Doshas and the Year's Cycle Ayurveda ascribes a significant role to our circadian rhythms since they influence Dosha balance and thus have a direct effect on wellbeing. In Ayurvedic teachings, the seasons are grouped into cycles. Spring = KAPHA Summer & Early Autumn = PITTA Late Autumn & Winter = VATA.
