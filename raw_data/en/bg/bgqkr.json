There is a lot of confusion out there about who can practice acupuncture, not to mention who is a competent Oriental medicine practitioner! There are so many different types of credentialed professionals who offer acupuncture in California. It is very difficult for the public to discern differences between these professionals who advertise the acupuncture modality. Every week a patient asks me some variation on this question: What is the difference between the different degrees and titles in terms of training and education? - The highest recognized degree in the United States is a Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (DAOM). The DAOM is a clinical doctorate and consists of both clinical and didactic courses. Most DAOM programs last for two years and offer specializations in Fertility, Gynecology, Pain Management, Cancer Treatment, Medical Qi Gong and Psychiatry. - Licensed Acupuncturists (LAC) trained in California is a license that can be obtained by people with different levels of education and prowess. However, they must either complete an intensive tutorial (a program in which Dr. Rozenn has trained students) or attend a 4 year full-time graduate program. - The BASIC entry level formal education required to sit for the California State boards consists of a Masters of Science (MTCM) or a Professional level doctorate in Traditional Chinese Medicine (DTCM) are variations of this program. The curriculum must consist of at least 3,000 hours and include didactic classes in Chinese medical theory and diagnosis, acupuncture theory and technique, herbology, and allopathic medicine; also required are 950 hours of clinical practice. The California state acupuncture licensing exam is infamous for its difficulty. With the passage of this exam, the title of Licensed Acupuncturist (LAC) is given. To keep the license current at least 50 hours of continuing education, including classes on drug-herb interactions and herb safety, has to be completed every two years. - DTCM/DAC Bridge Programs are available to those who completed a Master's program, want to be called a doctor, but do not wish to gain a DAOM. This is an easy route to a \"doctorate\". To obtain this degree, candidates take a few online courses, geared to be completed in less than a year. There is generally no additional Chinese medicine education. Instead, there are allopathic medicine classes. This is a shortcut to appease the MTCM degree holders who want to be called doctors. - In sharp contrast to the rigorous education those with a LAC possess, MDs can insert acupuncture needles with no specific Acupuncture or Oriental Medicine training. California law considers acupuncture to be within the scope of practice of allopathic doctors, even though they may not have one hour of training in acupuncture, Chinese medicine, herbal formulas, or drug-herb interactions, etc., MDs are allowed to preform acupuncture under their license and advise patients about herbal medicinals. While not required by the state, some MDs have taken courses related to acupuncture such as classes at the entry level. These classes are so basic. I am not aware of any specific acupuncture program for MDs that is longer than 500 hours, a popular course in California boasts 300 hours of training. Dentists and podiatrists may offer acupuncture treatment as long as they stay with in their scope of practice and complete an acupuncture course. While it is my experience that MDs on the whole are very free with their opinion of Chinese herbs and drug herb interactions, they often have absolutely no training in Western or Chinese herbal medicinals or herb-drug interactions. Make an informed decision. Choose a practitioner based on their education and experience in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine and their unique education and specialties. If a practitioner claims to specialize in something, ask them how they obtained the specialty? Some practicers claim areas of specialization with little to no advanced education.
