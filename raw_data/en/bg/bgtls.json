What has lain dormant all winter opens its eyes, blinks, and begins to stretch in buds of green that dream of the colors it can become. In order to stretch, you have to create room - and that means clearing away the old and the stagnant to make space for growth and potential. So, when we talk spring cleaning, we mean cleaning all parts of our lives: our environment, our homes, our bodies, our minds. What do you need to cleanse and get out of the way so that you can start fresh this spring? Perhaps, you have clothes in your closets that you no longer wear that someone else could repurpose and make a part of their fresh, new look. Maybe, there are some thoughts that no longer serve you being your best self and need to be revised. Possibly, there are people around you who do not support you or bring out your best qualities. And, is it likely that your liver and/or intestines would like to clean out some of the toxins that have accumulated over the past while, so that they can do a more efficient job of creating energy and health for your body? Yes, spring! The liver, especially, loves having a spring cleaning. So, be sure to refer to previous newsletters for recipes and ideas or check in at herbs, etc. Another reminder is that the body does its best cleansing between the time of the Full moon and the New moon. Since the moon's gravitational pull influences bodies of water, and we are bodies of water (hopefully, you are drinking your water, and you count!), the time when the moon is waning reinforces our bodies' natural inclination to push out and release. So, begin brainstorming how you are going to maximize the energy of cleansing this spring, write your to- do lists, and start taking action! Winter is a cocoon. Spring is the metamorphosis into transformation. Emerge a butterfly.

Rounding Up Rope Worms A rope worm is a parasite that is different from other para- sites, like roundworms or tapeworms. Discovered in 2009 following routine enema therapy, they were brought to the public's attention by Dr. Alex Volinsky and Dr. Nikolai Gubarev who introduced the rope worm at the 2013 Inter- national Chronic Disease Conference with the statement that they estimated every human being may be infected with some type of rope worm. Several years later, we are finding that to be true. Rope worms are often mistaken for intestinal lining or de-cayed food matter. When examined, they were found to contain human DNA. In fact, there are five stages of rope worm development. In the 1 st stage, the rope worms re- semble mucus and can be hosted anywhere in the human body. In the 2 nd stage, they look like slimy mucus and emit bubbles. In the 3rd stage, they resemble branched jellyfish. In the 4th and 5th stage, they look like twisted fi- bers of a rope, though the body is softer and slimier in the 4th stage. Later stage rope worms attach to the intestinal wall by way of suction cup -like bubbles. Their color de- pends on the food a person eats and varies from white to black. They can be located anywhere in the human body but prefer the small and large intestines and can grow to over one meter in length. The rope worms move inside the body by releasing gas bubbles and utilizing jet propulsion. They have also been observed to twist like a corkscrew which increases their ability to block large portions of the intestinal lining and also, to allow them to squeeze material out of fecal matter and feed on it. Additionally, they have been shown to re- lease toxins in the body as a waste product. It has further been suggested that they prevent nutrient absorption, be- cause food substances have been found in their remains. Symptoms of rope worms vary, though many people expe-rience gas, bloating, headaches, indigestion, worsening allergies, weight gain or loss, rashes, back pain, and fre-quent illness. Another key symptom seems to be coughs or respiratory issues that start as a regular While the scientific world awaits a full genomic sequencing of rope worm samples to determine if they are truly a new-ly recognized infectious parasite or if they're some type of mucoid plaque that the body has released from cleansing, few organizations seem to want to provide the funding for this research. Yet, because rope worms seem to be dif-ferent from other types of parasites, several theories have been presented to explain their presence. One theory is that they result from an overabundance of mucus in the intestinal tract. Other theories are that they form from a biofilm in the intestines or from candida/yeast overgrowth. Still, another theory questions if they may be a byproduct of genetically modified organisms (GMO'S) or if the GMO's combine with human bacteria and intestinal cells to create this new form of parasite. There is 82.6% match between the COI sequences obtained from the rope worm's stages 3 and 5. In stages 3 and 5,the rope worm has developed to contain 99% human rRNA. Regardless, it is a good idea to do routine parasite cleans- ing, and avoid genetically modified foods and eat organic. And, if you want to target rope worms specifically, we are discovering that certain herbs are better at cleansing them than other more traditional herbal parasite cleansers. Mi- mosa seed, found in the Para -1 product, as well as the Liquid Albizia tincture and the Sensitive Plant flower es- sence are all proving to be effective for rope worm cleans-es. We have already had over 30 clients pass these more than curious parasites! To create a more personal- ized cleansing program, schedule a consultation with one of the naturopaths at H erbs, etc . ROPE WORMS & RESPIRA TION BY AMY JO HOWARD, ND, CH Disclaimer: This research has not been peer reviewed. At the time of it 's publication the researchers have hypothesis that the features described are of parasitic nature. Current DNA analysis results are inconclusive, however, only a small percentage of the sequenced DNA has a match in GenBank. This information is written for information purposes only and is not intended to diagnose or treat any disease. The researchers have asked if you have symptoms described in their research please contact a health professional in your country. Yes.... We Really Have Passed Them!!! 4 Living Streams Mission produces a line of liquid probiotics that are unique in that they are used in their complete form. Nothing is added or taken away. They contain nutri- ents in a form that are easily usable by the human body. They are even compatible with absorption through the skin and mucus membranes such as the eyes. This opens many non -traditional pathways into the body. On a daily basis, our bodies are bombarded by Round-up (Glyphosate), herbicides, pesticides, and other toxic chemicals being sprayed on crops which has infiltrated our water tables, land and air. Our bodies are becoming overwhelmed by these chemicals which in turn wipe out our beneficial bacteria and prevent nutrient ab- sorption. Our immune system is not the only body system or body functions dependent on healthy bacteria. When we add stress, vaccines, GMOs, preservatives, artificial ingredients, sugar and a SAD diet in general, the result is major immune disorders, digestive weakness and weak- ness in other body systems. Results of this are fungus, parasites, mold, bacteria and viruses going haywire. In turn, many people are suffering with chronic health issues. These environmental poisons are destroying our body's ability to uptake minerals. Thousands of body functions are dependent on beneficial bacteria and minerals in order to have correct amino acid function, utilize vitamins and have working hormones. Their products have been creat- ed to work with balancing the bacteria in the body in order to heal the immune system, counteract glyphosate and other environmental poisons. They are helpful for eliminat- ing viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungus from the body. Living Streams \"Multi Blend:\" this liquid Probiotic is a natural by -product of friendly bio -organisms (probiotics) that have been specially cultured and developed to pro- duce the natural anti -infective substances the human body was meant to receive from flora in the intestinal tract. Liv- ing Streams Multi Blend is specially formulated and pro-cessed to \"super activate\" their natural bio -production of beneficial substances that supports the immune system against infective agents such as mold, fungus, yeast, viral components and bacteria. Derma Gold is considered \"The most Advanced Break- through in Liquid Probiotics.\" This probiotic formula is \"paracasei flora\" specific. It is best used as a dermal (skin) application. This potent probiotic is helpful to use in health issues related to abnormal cell growth, dermatitis, fungus, pathogens, candida, viruses, bacteria, biofilm and para- sites. It is especially helpful for SIBO (Small Intestine Bac-teria Overgrowth). Living Streams \"Bifido\" helps replenish \"good\" bacteria that assists with the proper digestion and absorption of food and nutrients as well as supports a healthy immune response. Curcumin has been added to this formula which has high levels of Yttrium. This is because Bifido is need- ed in the gut to use yttrium. Yttrium can be displaced in the body by heavy metals such as aluminum and is need-ed for repairing broken genes. Yttrium is the most abun- dant stop termination codon and the first and second most important mineral for whole protein sequences. Yttrium also enhances the absorption and distribution of selenium, another important mineral for DNA sequencing and repair. Chabide: derives from the original ancient English where \"Ch\" is the life -giving \"I\" and \"abide\" means to live, remain true to the dwelling residence, our bodies. Chabide is pin- eal gland food. Chabide helps nourish both the thyroid and pineal glands which, in turn, will help repair and reg- ulate the endocrine system. Chabide is made from a pro- prietary blend of herbs to stimulate the gland to grow and reawaken. The pineal gland is one of the smallest and most important endocrine glands in the body. It is located in the center of the brain close to the pituitary gland and gets its name from its characteristic pine cone shape. It is also known as the \"Third Eye.\" The pineal gland controls your body's sleep and pattern. Fluoride ingestion causes calcification of the pineal gland which will inhibit many of its functions. Chabide is able to bypass this calci-fication and gets the pineal gland active again. If taken in conjunction with the Bifido, it will help de -calcify the pineal gland much faster. Chabide aids in repairing all body sys-tems, not just the immune system. The bacteria in Chabide is bioavailable and promotes much needed sul-phur uptake to the hypothalamus from the digestive tract. Flora PM Flora PM has Pre -digested humic minerals which help fuel the body on a cellular level, while the trace minerals build new cells. It also contains Lactobacillus plantarum to aid in restoring the digestive tract and improve the ability to di-gest food. Helps replenish and maintain healthy intestinal flora balance as well as helps heal the digestive tract and leaky gut. Flora PM repairs hormone function and female reproductive organ health as well as menopause symp- toms. Flora PM is anti -parasitic, anti -viral & anti -bacterial. Living Streams - Probiotics by Skin, Eyes, and More By Lori Becker, NHP Want Your Brain To Feel Amazing? Living Streams Continued! Carbon 60 is a Helium carbon, \"perfect\" molecule. It is also called a \"Bucky Ball\" or \"Buckminsterfullerene\" as it was discovered by Buckminster Fuller. Fuller was an American architect, systems theorist, author, designer, and inventor. He was hailed as \"one of the greatest minds of our times.\" Carbon 60 has 60 atoms formed in lattice work into a sphere that looks like a soccer ball or a Bucky Ball. This perfect sacred geometric form promotes harmony. It spe- cifically helps the body deal with oxidative stress. Many diseases are from states of oxidative stress since it dam- ages DNA. Carbon 60 is the best anti -oxidant found so far on the planet. In rat studies, the ones that were given Car- bon 60 and exposed to lethal amounts of radiation had no ill effects. Their life -spans were also extended exponen- tially. Scientists discovered that Carbon 60 protects the integrity and geometric web of our being on an atomic level. This protection allows coherence and harmony when exposed to damaging frequencies. Certain bacteria is needed for the body to create magnetite and greigite which is neces- sary for the body's electromagnetic field to maintain its integrity. Therefore, our healthy magnetic polarity is compromised when our bacteria is disrupted. Its integrity is also compromised by these damaging electromagnetic frequencies. Liv-ing Streams Mission has created the most advanced C60 probiotic available since they have blended Carbon 60 with beneficial bacteria and min-erals. Benefits of Living Streams Carbon 60: Diffuses electromagnetic frequencies and creates coherence and harmony. Brings hydrogen into cells and through the blood brain barrier which neutralizes oxidative stress. Re-establishes the body's homeostasis. Increases physical Strength. Improves mental capacity, gets rid of brain fog and improves vision. Promotes a sense of peace and calmness. Protects against EMFs by diffusion which will be especially helpful when the US turns over to a health detrimental 5G network. Helps you detox more efficiently as well as neu- tralizes poisons. Harmonzies the energy field of the body. Note: You must be careful when taking it with prescrip- tions as it can neutralize them. 5 March 23 \u201424: Interpreting Your Own Blood Tests \u2014Part 1 For many practitioners, blood analysis is simply a matter of comparing a test result with a reference chart and seeing whether or not the client's results are normal or abnormal.

From the water that we drink and the sunshine that we soak up, to the plants and fungus that grow from the earth, we are surrounded by the balancing medicine of nature. Although it is easy to pass by these treasures without giving them much thought, these forces among us may just be the ticket to saving not only ourselves, but our planet as well. One of the best -kept secrets in nature lives in the fungus kingdom. When our planet is damaged from radiation, mushrooms grow in abundance, because they obtain their energy from radiation. These wonderful organisms actual- ly help to clean up our soil from radiation! Certain types of fungi have been used to help clean up E. coli bacteria in contaminated waters. Not only do they clean up extremely harmful radiation and bacteria, but mycelia (mushroom spores) clean up toxic waste from oil spills as well! Mushrooms to the Rescue! Something needs to be done to help the planet with the high levels of toxicity to which has been exposed. Mushrooms are nature's perfect solution! These nutrient -filled organisms clean up the mess made in both our inner and outer environments. Since humans are more closely related to fungi than any other kingdom, the fungus among us responds very well to the human body. One of the most impres- sive effects of mushrooms is their ability to boost the immune system. This is something that ancient cul-tures have known for thousands of years. Mushrooms were fed to the Egyptian Pharaohs, as they were associated with immortality. The Chinese often used them for longevity. And today, we use mushrooms for their anti -viral and anti -bacterial properties that have been proven to help the body heal from diseases such as polio, HIV, influenza, some cancers, small pox, and hepatitis B to name a few. There are several different mushroom products available to help boost the immune system when it has been under attack. When using mushrooms medicinally, it is always important to get them from a trusted source as the wrong form could be damaging to health. There are several different types of mush- room teas that can be added into hot water for a fast acting immune boost. Nature's Sunshine has several different mushroom products including Immune Stimulator and Cordyceps to help stimulate the immune cells. For more information on the amazing benefits of mushrooms, seek Paul Stament who has done a TED Talk about the benefits of mushrooms. by Denise Denman, NHP We've Got Your Immune Mushrooms!

Day Kids Too 9 The flu has been a big concern over the winter, espe- cially because it has been related to so many fatalities. The flu is caused by the influenza virus and is a conta- gious respiratory illness. Symptoms of the flu include cough, fever, runny nose, headaches, muscle and body aches, fatigue, and less commonly, vomiting and diarrhea. It is important to note that many of the people who have died have not died from the influenza virus itself but from a secondary infection, like pneumonia. Also, in the past, the most dangerous influenza epidemics and pan-demics have continued past the winter months, occur- ring at any time of the year. Here are some considera- tions so that you can protect yourself from the flu no matter what the season. Sensible practices - Let's remind ourselves: Cough into your elbow, not your hands. Wash your hands with soap and water, and avoid anti -bacterial soaps. In like fashion, don't use anti -bacterial hand sanitizers either. (They kill off the friendly bacteria on your skin, so this actually creates more harm than good.) Avoid pro-cessed and genetically modified foods, and eat lots of organic fruits and vegetables. And, if you're not feeling well, stay home. Vitamin C - With antioxidant and anti -inflammatory properties, vitamin C has been shown to be effective for reducing the severity and symptoms of the cold and flu as well as having a long history of boosting the immune system. Elderberry - This herb has been shown to deactivate the influenza virus and reduce the duration of the flu when taken within the first 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. It has immune stimulating properties, is high in antioxi-dants, and helps the respiratory system. herbs etc carries this in liquid tincture or as a capsule from Nature's Sunshine in the Elderberry D3fense (along with vitamin D3 and Echinacea \u2014all good immune boosters!). PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THE FLU by Amy Jo Howard, ND, CH Oscillococcinum Prepared specifically for countering influenza by a French physician who was examining influenza pa- tients' blood during the time of the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1917, this homeopathic remedy helps to gently stimu-late the body's own immune system and thereby, re- lieves the symptoms of the flu and may help the body recover faster. VS-C - A Chinese herbal blend from Nature's Sunshine, VS-C comes in liquid or capsule form and is wonderful for strengthening the immune system and deactivating viruses. Thieves oil - This oil blend from Young Living is dyna- mite as it contains essential oils with anti -bacterial, anti - viral, anti -infectious, antiseptic, and immune stimulating properties. And, if you know how this blend got its name, then it would remind you how powerful it is! Vitamin D3 - Aiding in the replication of healthy cells, this vitamin offers protection against the cold and flu. Probiotics - Maintaining optimal levels of friendly flora in the gut is a must for having a healthy immune system. Nature's Sunshine's Probiotic Eleven or the Liquid Multi- Blend from Living Streams are favorites! There are so many natural remedies that you can utilize to take care of yourself and strengthen your immune system. If you would like a more personal-ized program, consult one of the Naturopaths at Herbs etc. What Is It? Biodynamics was the first modern organic agricul- ture. Its development began with a series of eight lec- tures on agriculture given by philosopher Rudolf Steiner . These lectures, the first known presentation of organic agriculture , were held in response to a request by farmers who noticed degraded soil conditions and a deterioration in the health and quality of crops and livestock resulting from the use of chemical fertilizers. The one hundred eleven attendees, less than half of whom were farmers, came from six countries, primarily Germany and Poland. The lectures were published in November 1924; the first English translation appeared in 1928 as The Agriculture Course . Biodynamics has much in common with other organic approaches - it empha- sizes the use of manures and composts and excludes the use of artificial chemi-cals on soil and plants. Methods unique to the biodynamic approach include its treatment of animals, crops, and soil as a single system, an organism, an emphasis from its beginnings on local production and distribution systems, its use of traditional and development of new local breeds and varieties. Some methods use an astrological sowing and planting calendar. Biodynamic agriculture uses vari- ous herbal and mineral additives for compost additives and field sprays. As of 2016, biodynamic techniques were used on 161,074 hectares in 60 countries. Germany accounts for 45% of the global total; the remainder average 1750 hec- tare per country. Biodynamic methods of cultivating grapevines have been taken up by several notable vine- yards. There are certification agencies for biodynamic products, most of which are members of the international biodynamics standards group Demeter International . Biodynamic agriculture differs from many forms of organic agriculture in its spiritual, mystical, and astrological orientation. It shares a spiritual focus, as well as its view toward improving humanity. Important features include the use of livestock manures to sustain plant growth (recycling of nutrients), maintenance and improvement of soil quality, and the health and well -being of crops and animals. Cover crops , green manures and crop ro- tations are used extensively on the farms to foster the diversity of plant and animal life and to enhance the bio- logical cycles and the biological activity of the soil. Biodynamic farms often have a cultural component and encourage local community, both through developing local sales and through on -farm community building activities. Some biodynamic farms use the Community Supported Agriculture model, which has connections with social three -folding . In his \"agricultural course,\" Steiner prescribed nine different preparations to aid fertilization and described how these were to be prepared. Steiner believed that these preparations mediated terrestrial and cosmic forces into the soil. The prepared substances are numbered 500 through 508, where the first two are used for preparing fields, and six are used for making compost . The approach considers that there are lunar and astrological influences on soil and plant development \u2014for example, choosing to plant, cultivate or harvest various crops based on both the phase of the moon and the zodiacal constellation the moon is pass-ing through and also depending on whether the crop is the root, leaf, flower, or fruit of the plant. Wayne Weiseman will bring all of the deepest aspects of Biodynamic farming and gardening to life. Plan to attend his spring extended weekend course.

Agricultural Settlement, Pastoralism (Animals), Natural Building Methods July 19 -22, 2018 This is a class focused on budgeting for a homestead, natural green building, renewable energy, biological waste management, food preservation and storage, permaculture principles, aquaculture and aquaponics. Urban/Suburban - Appropriate Technology and the Ecological Epoch October 11 -14, 2018 The course components in this last segment on permaculture principles and design will look at land use planning, pattern understanding and observational skills, vegetation, land cover and natural resource mapping, natural medicine, earth works and water systems. Wayne Weiseman is a Permaculture teacher, designer, consultant and author. He was certified to teach Permaculture by Bill Mollison, the founder of Permaculture, and is recognized by the Worldwide Permaculture Network as an instructor of the Permaculture Design Certificate Course. Wayne has taught hundreds of Permaculture Design Certificate courses and advanced work, lectured and consulted internationally for many years. His design portfolio includes numerous master plans for various clients. Wayne has worked as a schoolteacher and as a consultant to educators and administrators in curriculum and professional development. As a primitive wilderness instructor, he relies on observation techniques and a thorough understanding of the natural world to ply his trade. He has worked extensively with corporate executives in the art of team building, and the application of ideas in business and life developed through the observation of the cycles and connections found in the natural world. He has worked as a builder and contractor, herbalist, renewable energy expert, and farmer for the past thirty years. For many years, Wayne man- aged a land -based, self -reliant community project combining organic crop/food production, ecologically -built shelter, renewable energy and appropriate technologies. Wayne's classes are very popular for beginners and laypeople as well. Attendees at last year's courses loved his knowledge, approachability, and style. We hope to expand the courses taught by this world renowned instructor. Show your support and take one or more of the four courses offered in 2018 . These courses, along with the biodynamic course, can be taken as a three or four part program or as individual courses. Each section will be taught Thursday afternoon through Sunday. The Courses will be held at Symbiosis Ranch in Mt. Pleasant. Each course is only $399 with a 60 day early bird discounted amount of $349, addition- al discounts for enrolling in all three or four can lower the enrollment to $300 per course.

Herbs etc can also provide more info/handouts regarding liver and gallbladder cleanses to aid in cleansing for spring! Spring is the perfect time to cleanse the liver and gallblad-der! In Traditional Chinese Medicine, spring is considered the season of the wood element and expansion. During this time, the body focuses energy upwards to the liver and gallbladder, prompting the cleansing of the blood and internal organs. This helps clear the stiffness and rigidity that builds up in these organs as well as joints. Some symptoms of needing to cleanse the liver and gallbladder are gallstones, allergies, headaches, nausea, irritability, foggy thinking, anger, depression, muscle tension, skin eruptions, itching and fatigue. Herbs etc offers multiple product options to utilize this per-fect time to purge toxins, purify the body, increase energy, and balance the body, mind and emotions! Nature's Sunshine \"Gall Bladder Formula\" This formula will soften gallstones! Gallstones can form, because there is not enough natural sodium in the body. Natural sodium is needed to keep calcium in solution. When there isn't enough of this natural sodium, stones can develop which will get hard and stuck. This puts much stress on the gallbladder and makes it hard for the body to eliminate. To help this, we need to increase natural sodi- um in diet as well as avoid calcium in the wrong form (i.e. pasteurized dairy). This formula also aids to repair diges- tion in general. Nature's Sunshine \"Milk Thistle\" Milk thistle can be used to increase the secretion of the flow of bile from the liver and gallbladder, and as such, it may be used in all problems associated with the gallblad- der. It is used for liver disorders, prevents liver damage and has antioxidants that function mainly in the liver. Milk thistle regenerates liver cells and treats all inflammatory conditions of the liver and skin. Nature's Sunshine \"Liver Cleanse Formula\" This is a great liver and digestive formula that is helpful for cleansing, gallstones, sluggish gallbladder and constipa- tion. It contains herbs that are helpful to the liver such as dandelion root, blessed thistle and yellow dock. Nature's Sunshine \"Liv -J\" This herbal blend has been used traditionally to support digestion, cleanse the digestive system, and nourish the liver and spleen. Dandelion is reported to have tonic ef- fects on the liver and gallbladder. Parsley contains chloro- phyll and acts as a natural digestive deodorizer. Red beet root has traditionally been used to support the liver.

By using these toxic chemicals to \"clean,\" per se, we are in essence doing the exact opposite of cleaning. Cleaning as a whole involves working with the nature of our environment using non -toxic cleaning agents that assist the natural process of decomposition. Cleaning products that use enzymes to help break things down do just that; these enzyme driven agents not only aid nature in its cleaning process, but they also work remarkably well in place of the more toxic cleaning products. Chemicals such as: Triclosan, an antimicrobial found in soaps, used on a regular basis will increase the amount of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Bleach, also known as sodium hypochlorite, contains a chlorine molecule which readily competes with iodine in the thyroid gland which could contribute to thyroid issues. Sodium hydroxide, often contained in drain and oven cleaners, is a chemical that is very corrosive when inhaled, is very irritating to the lungs and mucosa, and could result in sore throat and allergy like symptoms. 2-Butoxyethanol, commonly seen in all -purpose cleaners, when inhaled like when cleaning in an unventilated area results in irritation to the respiratory system. Other issues that may result are pulmonary edema, kidney and/or liver damage. 13 Let's Keep It Clean By Rachel Friesen, ND The next time you go on a cleaning spree, look for cleaning products that are cleaner for your body and your environment.
