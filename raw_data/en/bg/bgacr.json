Today, there is an emerging consensus in humanitarian and public health circles that there can be no physical health without mental health. Distressingly, a recent Lancet series found \"widespread systematic, and long-term neglect of resources for mental health care in low-income and middle-income countries\" - home to most of the 450 million currently suffering from mental problems - meaning that help is out of reach for most of those who need it. What emerges from this reality is the need for humanitarian mental health interventions alongside other complex emergency interventions where a disaster- or violence-impacted population lacks adequate access to psychological care. In fact, mental health has become in the last fifteen years an increasingly integral component of some humanitarian relief programs. But a cadre of skeptics considers the application of Western psychological concepts - particularly the model of 'Posttraumatic Stress Disorder' - to non-Western cultures both ethnocentric and arrogant, not to mention ineffectual and potentially harmful. It is true that even the best-intentioned psychosocial intervention, if poorly grounded in the local culture, can do more harm than good. But this does not mean that psychosocial interventions in complex emergencies are not ethically warranted when a population has little or no access to mental health care, and it does not mean that interventions cannot be made exceptionally culturally-sensitive, drawing on the expertise of local healers and staying loyal to the essence of what a particular community believes about wellness and illness, functionality and non-functionality, purpose and meaning, life and death. This paper seeks to contribute to making the case for culturally-sensitive psychosocial interventions in one especially traumatized population - Sudan's internally displaced. After contextualizing the country's crisis of forced migration, surveying its anemic mental health services, and delving deeper into the psychological fallout of the displacement experience to solidify a moral imperative to intervene where there is nowhere for the traumatized to turn, it moves from theory to practice, investigating how mental health interventions in Sudan can be made culturally sensitive through deeper understanding of Sudanese conceptions and manifestations of mental distress. It serves as a practical guide for psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, and other helping professionals who participate in internationally-led psychosocial programs in Sudan's IDP camps. iii DEDICATION To my parents, Steve and Mary Neff, whose unfailing generosity and support sustained me through The Fletcher School. iv ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to thank in particular Dr. Richard Mollica of the Harvard Program on Refugee Trauma, Dr. Lynne Jones of the International Medical Corps, my colleagues at both Harvard Medical School's Global Mental Health: Trauma and Recovery certificate program and the Center for International Health and Cooperation's Mental Health in Complex Emergencies conference, and my faculty advisor at The Fletcher School, Professor Eileen Babbitt. v TABLE OF CONTENTS A note on terminology (vii) !

It is defined as a state of complete mental wellbeing including social, spiritual, cognitive and emotional aspects.\"1 Mental illness is \"a disorder of the cognition (thinking) an/or the emotions (mood) as defined by standard diagnostic systems such as the International Classifications of Disorders, 10th Edition (ICD-10) or the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Revised 4th Edition (DSM-IV-R).\"2 Psychosocial disorders \"relate to the interrelationship of psychological and social problems, which together constitute the disorder. The term psychosocial is used to underscore the close and dynamic connection between the psychological and the social realms of human experience. Psychological aspects are those that affect thoughts, emotions, behavior, memory, learning ability, perceptions and understanding. Social aspects refer to the effects on relationships, traditions, culture and values, family and community, also extending to the economic realm and its effects on status and social networks. The term is also intended to warn against focusing narrowly on mental health conceptions (e.g., psychological trauma) at the risk of ignoring aspects of the social context that are vital to wellbeing. The emphasis on psychosocial also aims to ensure that family and community are fully integrated in assessing needs and interventions.\"3 Trauma \"means that the individual has experienced, witnessed, or been confronted with an event or events that involve actual or threatened death or injury or a threat to the physical integrity of others. By this definition, traumatic events that [the displaced] may encounter include exposure to war-related violence, sexual assault, torture, incarceration, genocide, and the threat of personal injury and annihilation.\"4 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), according to the UN's Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, are \"persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border.\" As the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) elaborates, the two key elements are the involuntary character of the movement (the causes of migration \"give no choice to people but to leave their homes and deprive them of the most essential protection mechanisms, such as community networks, access to services, livelihoods,\" and the resettlement within national borders (i.e., \"[u]nlike refugees, who have been deprived of the protection of their state of origin, 1 Quoted in full from Florence Baingana, Ian Bannon and Rachel Thomas, \"Mental Health and Conflicts: Conceptual Framework and Approaches,\" World Bank Health, Nutrition and Population (Human Development Network) Discussion Paper (Washington, D.C.: World Bank, 2005), 8. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. 4 Quoted in full from Matthew Friedman and James Jaranson, \"The Applicability of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Concept to Refugees,\" in Amidst Peril and Pain: The Mental Health and Well-Being of the World's Refugees, ed.

IDPs should therefore enjoy the same rights as the rest of the population.\"5 Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), as defined by the National Institute of Mental Health based on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), is \"an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened. Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, accidents, or military combat.\" For full description and diagnostic criteria, please see Appendix 2. Additionally, this paper rests on understandings of common psychological terminology as defined succinctly by Jens Modvig and James M. Jaranson. They are provided here as a quick reference: Harm: Pain, suffering, loss, injury, or death Danger: A situation characterized by increased risk of harm Threat: A phenomenon (statement or situation) with an inherent potential of harm Stressor: A stimulus that produces a stress-response Traumatic event: An event that produces fear, helplessness, or horror Pain: A discomforting sensation manifesting a threat to the physical integrity Suffering: A discomforting sensation manifesting a threat to the physical an/or the psychological integrity (also includes distress - \"mental pain\") 5 See Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, \"The definition of an internally displaced person (IDP),\" available at: http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004D404D/(httpPages)/CC32D8C34EF93C88802570F800517610?

They stabbed my brother here in the front...they killed my brother with a knife. And one of my brother's cousins...they opened the stomach and they put the intestines on the chest of my aunt. They cut the arms, the legs and they cut the head off. I see it like it is happening now. I see the images exactly like I saw the day the people were killed. And sometimes I become deaf because hearing sounds like guns and shooting my ears become closed. When I remember that...I used to cry sometimes...and I can't eat...sometimes I sleep without eating because of what I think I saw...I have never seen things like that. -Mozambican displaced child, 1991.6 I. Introduction: No Health Without Mental Health \"Creation is a nightmare spectacular,\" writes Ernest Becker, \"taking place on a planet that has been soaked for hundreds of millions of years in the blood of all its creatures.\"7 The twentieth century was history's most spectacularly nightmarish, a conscience-shocking orgy of savagery and suffering that shows little sign of abating. By one estimate, war and atrocity has killed 216 million since 1900.8 Each year overt violence claims 1.6 million lives and structural violence - due to environmental degradation, poverty, famine, and other institutionalized brutality and injustice - more silently and insidiously takes 17 or 18 million more.9 A web of interactive manmade and natural forces, from ecological disasters to tribal skirmishes to campaigns of genocide, perpetuates mankind's ages-old cycle of trauma. Victims become perpetrators, perpetrators create new victims, and bystanders - through their active or passive complicity - \"endorse [the aggressors'] animus towards the targeted group\" and \"cooperate in the execution of their fearsome design.\"10 Violence's impact on physical health is both intuitively apparent and scientifically documented.11 The 1979 US Surgeon General's report Healthy People was first to formally cite 6 Quoted in Alastair Ager, \"Mental Health Issues in Refugee Populations: A Review,\" Working Paper of the Harvard Center for the Study of Culture and Medicine (July 1993), 7. 7 E.

WHO defines violence as \"the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or 2 violence's \"critical role in the development of many serious diseases and injuries.\"12 In 1996 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared violence a \"leading public worldwide health problem\" and made it a top priority for public health research.13 The 2002 WHO World Report on Violence and Health noted that violence costs \"billions of US dollars in annual health care expenditures worldwide, and billions more for national economies in terms of days lost from work, law enforcement and lost investment.\"14 Collective violence particularly - that suffering inflicted by one group on another for political, social, or economic objectives - has a profound impact on physical health.15 WHO approximates that 310,000 people succumbed to war-related injuries in 2000, and legions more survived but suffered disfigurement and disease. Inter-group conflict, terrorism, and state-sponsored human rights abuses like torture and sexual violence have \"vast effects\" on the manifestation of somatic illnesses and disabilities, through increased mortality (e.g., deaths due to weapons attacks or infections), increased morbidity (e.g., mutilation from torture, chronic malnutrition, HIV serioconversion after rape used as a weapon of war), and increased disability (e.g., physical incapacitation preventing productive livelihoods). 16 These are violence's overt wounds. \"Less visible, but even more widespread\" than the physical scars of war, writes Nelson Mandela, \"is the legacy of day-to-day, individual suffering\" community, that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment or deprivation.\" 12 See Healthy People - The Surgeon General's Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1979), 2-3. 13 \"Prevention of violence: a public health priority,\" Proceedings of the 49th World Health Assembly, Geneva, 20-25 May 1996, available at: http://www.who.int/entity/violence_injury_prevention/resources/publications/en/WHA4925_eng.pdf 14 World report on violence and health, 3. 15 Collective violence is here defined as \"the instrumental use of violence by people who identify themselves as members of a group - whether this group is transitory or has a more permanent identity - against another group or set of individuals, in order to achieve political, economic, or social objectives.\" See Ibid., 215.

This suffering...is a legacy that reproduces itself, as new generations learn from the violence of generations past, as victims learn from victimizers,... as the social conditions that nurture violence are allowed to continue.18 Today, clinical literature overflows with narratives of such human-inflicted psychological scars. A girl of 20, a former political prisoner who once \"had been forced to undergo a sham execution, in which some of her companions were really executed,\" suffers frequently from \"nightmares in which her mother die[s], and... [sometimes wakes] thinking that she herself [is] dead.\" A 13-year-old boy \"suffer[s] from concentration problems and nightmares about the death of his [disappeared] father. He had never seen a picture of his father because his mother had locked them all away in a suitcase and he never asked her about him because he thought that would make her nervous.\" A 22-year-old African refugee who had been forced to relocate five times within two years retains to this day \"the habit of carrying all his personal papers with him in a big bag: always prepared to move house within 10 minutes.\" A 25-year-old Middle Eastern awakes from fright \"when he [hears] the neighbours coming home\" and clenches in panic during the day at the noise of keys rattling or footsteps on stairs - he associates these sounds with his arbitrary detention when \"the prison guards climbed the stairs of the gallery and rattled their keys while opening the cell doors to take the prisoners to be tortured.\" Much more prevalent but no less insidious are lower- 17 World report on violence and health: summary, v. 18 Ibid. 4 grade traumatic reactions to violence - grief-driven isolation, erosion of spirituality, pervasive feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, and existential doubt.19 The mental health effects of violence are, in the words of trauma research pioneer Richard Mollica of the Harvard Program on Refugee Trauma (HPRT), \"invisible wounds\" that until very recently have received tragically scant attention. \"While public discussions of the psychological impact of extreme violence, including natural disasters, are now commonplace in the media,\" he writes, \"twenty-five years ago they were almost non-existent. In fact, they were almost taboo.\" Mollica recalls how, in the mid-1980s, he was turned away at the door of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) because the Commissioner \"firmly believed that refugees did not have emotional problems or psychological distress associated with their displacement and homeless state.\" This assumption reflected the era's prevailing attitudes about the global prevalence of psychological distress. \"At that time it was impossible for international and American policymakers and humanitarian relief agencies to accept the invisible psychological wounds affecting traumatized persons throughout the world,\" he writes. \"Today there is instead a demand for scientific methods and practices to help heal those wounds.\"20 Indeed, much has changed since then. There is an emerging consensus in humanitarian aid, public health, medical, and psychological circles that there can be no physical health without mental health.21 The UN was first to publicly surmise this linkage when, after World War II, it classified health in exceptionally broad terms, as \"complete physical, mental and social well-being 19 See Guus van der Veer, Counselling and Therapy with Refugees and Victims of Trauma: Psychological Problems of Victims of War, Torture and Repression, 2nd ed. (Chichester, UK: John Wiley & Sons, 1998), 10-15. 20 Richard F. Mollica, Healing Invisible Wounds: Paths to Hope and Recovery in a Violent World (Orlando, FL: Harcourt, Inc., 2006), 5-7. See also Mollica, \"Invisible Wounds: Waging a New Kind of War,\" Scientific American 282, no. 6 (June 2000): 54-57. 21 The best article covering this newly emerging consensus is Martin Prince, Vikram Patel, Shekhar Saxena, Mario Maj, Joanna Maselko, Michael R. Phillips, and Atif Rahman, \"No health without mental health,\" Lancet 370 (2007): 859-77. See also \"No health without mental health,\" Insights Health 6 (January 2005): 1-2, available at: www.id21.org. 5 and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\"22 Today, advances in neuropsychology and brain imaging as well as the cultivation of more rigorous empirical research methods have produced a body of medical evidence that irrefutably links physical and psychological health. In the first of a landmark 2007 six-part series on Global Mental Health in the Lancet medical journal, Martin Prince and colleagues report that \"[a]bout 14% of the global burden of disease has been attributed to neuropsychiatric disorders, mostly due to the chronically disabling nature of depression and other common mental disorders, alcohol-use and substance-use disorders, and psychoses,\" and this \"burden of mental disorders is likely to have been underestimated because of inadequate appreciation of the connectedness between mental illness and other health conditions.\" Epidemiological studies now demonstrate that \"mental disorders increase risk for communicable and non-communicable diseases, and contribute to unintentional and intentional injury. Conversely, many health conditions increase the risk for mental disorder, and co-morbidity complicates help-seeking, diagnosis, and treatment, and influences prognosis.\"23 Intuitive examples of these protean connections between the somatic and psychological abound. A destitute man lacking clean water contracts tuberculosis and cannot work; unable to provide for his family, he becomes progressively weighed down by depression and shame. A woman forced to scavenge for firewood miles from her refugee camp is raped en route and later shunned by her family and friends; preoccupied with self-hatred, she isolates from the community and becomes suicidal. A schizophrenic grows paranoid and violent after being chained to a tree for several weeks by villagers who fear that evil spirits possesses him; he becomes seriously 22 World Health Organization, \"Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization,\" WHO Official Records, No. 2 (22 July 1946), 100. The definition was \"extremely avant-garde at its inception,\" reflects Mollica, for it conspicuously emphasized well-being over illness. See Mollica, Healing Invisible Wounds, 193. 23 Prince et al., \"No health without mental health,\" 859. 6 malnourished because few dare to offer him food. An overworked business executive attends meditation retreats on doctor's orders because his crippling anxiety puts him at substantially greater risk for cardiovascular disease. Distressingly, the Lancet series found \"widespread systematic, and long-term neglect of resources for mental health care in low-income and middle-income countries\" - home to most of the 450 million currently suffering from mental problems - meaning that help is out of reach for most of those who need it.24 The WHO's \"Atlas Project,\" the first attempt at a comprehensive snapshot of mental healthcare worldwide, reveals that around one-third of all countries (and a full half of African states) have no mental health policies or plans whatsoever. Almost 40% of the policies that do sit on the books have been gathering dust since 1990, taking no account of recent science.25 For every ten thousand people in Africa, there is 0.34 of a psychiatric bed. Only 52% of low-income countries (compared to 97% of high-income) provide any form of community-based mental healthcare; consequently, those few patients who do receive \"treatment\" in these poorest corners often find it locked away in psychiatric wards or insane asylums where rights abuses are the norm. Psychotropic medications freely and cheaply dispensed in the West are scarce and expensive elsewhere; about a quarter of low-income countries do not provide the most basic of antidepressants. Most importantly, there is a critical shortage of mental health professionals in the developing world: Afghanistan, with a population of 25 million, has two psychiatrists; Chad, a country of 9 million, has just one. Overall, low-income countries have 0.05 psychiatrists and 0.16 24 Shekhar Saxena, Graham Thornicroft, Martin Knapp, and Harvey Whiteford, \"Resources for mental health: scarcity, inequity, and inefficiency,\" Lancet 370 (2007): 878-89. 25 World Health Organization, Mental Health Atlas (Geneva: World Health Organization, 2005). 7 psychiatric nurses per hundred thousand people. Qualified psychological attention is simply nonexistent for the bulk of the world's mentally ill populations.26 Countries neglect mental health for a myriad of reasons. Psychological concepts are knotty and theoretical, frequently confounding and overwhelming decisionmakers. Mental health indicators like \"estimated prevalence of depression\" can appear wishy-washy compared with more concrete mortality or vaccination statistics. Public interest tends to be anemic; as one NGO worker notes, there is no \"ground swell of public opinion on mental health issues which will force the governments to allocate more funds for mental health.\" Further, \"people with mental disorders and their families in low-income and middle-income countries are only rarely mobilized to form powerful constituencies, and to press for the availability of effective and humane mental health care.\" Even where they do so, governments often doubt the cost-effectiveness of mental health initiatives, or dismiss them as the domain of charity or religion.27 More surreptitiously, ignoring trauma is perhaps a universal human impulse when faced with unspeakable acts. \"The ordinary response to atrocities is to banish them from consciousness,\" writes Harvard psychiatrist Judith Herman:28 To study psychological trauma is to come face to face both with human vulnerability in the natural world and with the capacity for evil in human nature. To study psychological trauma means bearing witness to horrible events. When the events are natural disasters or \"acts of God,\" those who bear witness sympathize readily with the victim. But when the traumatic events are of human design, those who bear witness are caught in the conflict between victim and perpetrator. It is morally impossible to remain neutral in this conflict. The bystander is forced to take sides.29 26 Saxena et al, \"Resources for mental health: scarcity, inequity, and inefficiency,\" 878-881. See also \"The global response to mental illness: an enormous health burden is increasingly being recognized,\" Devi Sridhar, and Chris Underhill, \"Barriers to improvement of mental health services in low-income and middle-income countries,\" Lancet 370 (2007): 1166-7. 28 Judith Herman, Trauma and Recovery: The aftermath of violence-from domestic abuse to political terror (New York: Basic Books, 1997), 1. 29 Herman, Trauma and Recovery, 7. 8 Because the victim \"asks the bystander to share the burden of pain\" and take action, while the perpetrator - appealing to the \"universal desire to see, hear, and speak no evil\" - only \"asks that the bystander do nothing,\" it is little wonder why so many with the power to address large-scale psychological anguish choose to turn the other cheek.30 Of course, a further explanation for the paucity of mental health services worldwide is violence itself. It is a tragic truism that one of the core causes of physical and psychological suffering - civil conflict - is the very thing that saps crucial resources and political will from the ethical mandate to promote healing in traumatized citizens. Indeed, all too often it is the government itself that is funding, fostering, or carrying out the traumatizing. As renowned trauma specialist Derrick Silove puts it, \"[t]he disruption of civil order that often creates the context for torture and related abuses itself leads to the undermining of social networks, systems of justice, health services, and other support structures that, in other circumstances, constitute important elements in the recovery environment for trauma survivors.\"31 One scarcely can expect robust state-run mental health programs in countries where it is the state that wants entire segments of the population repressed or wiped out entirely. What emerges from this reality, then, is the need for humanitarian mental health interventions alongside other complex emergency interventions where a disaster- or violence-impacted population lacks adequate access to psychological care. Of course, sovereignty rears its head here as it does in all relief impulses. But as Francis Deng implores in his capacity as Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), \"[w]ith such large numbers of people exposed to extreme suffering and maybe death as a result [of state action 30 Ibid. 31 Derrick Silove, \"The Psychosocial Effects of Torture, Mass Human Rights Violations, and Refugee Trauma,\" The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease 187, no. 4 (1999): 200-1. 9 or inaction], it is paradoxical for the international community to continue to rely on the states to provide protection by their national authorities.\" He urges a reconceptualization of sovereignty \"as a normative concept of state responsibility for its citizens and those under its jurisdiction,... backed by national and international accountability, with incentives and disincentives, including various forms of intervention, ranging from diplomatic persuasion to economic sanctions, and, in extreme cases, military actions, sometimes accorded through peacekeeping operations.\"32 This now-prevalent call for \"responsible\" sovereignty, checked by international involvement where morally required, is bolstered by critical mental health needs as much as it is by the more overt obligation to save lives and livelihoods when a state is unable or unwilling to do so. In fact, mental health has become in the last fifteen years an increasingly integral component of some humanitarian relief programs.33 This development is the culmination of several milestones in twentieth century psychological science. The first was the post-World War I discovery that veterans seemed to suffer significantly greater risk of psychiatric disability than the 32 Francis M. Deng, \"Internal Displacement: A Challenge of Peace, Security, and Nation Building,\" in Emergency Relief Operations, ed. Kevin M. Cahill (New York: Fordham University Press and The Center for International Health and Cooperation, 2003), 115-16. See the preface's \"Note on Terminology\" for precise definition of IDP. 33 International Medical Corps, for example, reports that it \"has been implementing psychosocial programs since 1993, but in 2003 began training primary health care providers to integrate mental health into their work, enabling them to identify and treat mental health problems. In addition, IMC sets up a variety of psychosocial support programs for the wider community depending on its needs.\" See IMC, \"Mental health in complex emergencies,\" available at: http://imcworldwide.org/microsites/mental_health/ mental_home.html. Moreover, WHO and UNHCR have collaborated on a manual, Mental Health of Refugees, \"now available in ten languages....,\" and report that \"[c]ommunity-based mental health projects, including development of policy and action plans, are implemented in several countries and are ready for replication. Also, a WHO model training of trainers program was created and field-tested in Rwanda and Burundi; it is ready for replication in other countries in the Great Lakes region and with the necessary adaptations it could be used in other countries. Recently, the WHO Declaration of Cooperation in Mental Health of Refugees and Internally Displaced Populations in Conflict and Post-Conflict Situations was developed in order to improve advocacy, international consensus in policy, programmes and cooperation. Also, the WHO tool for the Rapid Assessment of Mental Health Needs of Refugees, and Displaced Populations and Resources, in Conflict and Post-Conflict Situation, is pre-finalised.\" See WHO, \"Mental health of refugees, internally displaced persons and other populations affected by conflict,\" available at: http://www.who.int/hac/techguidance/pht/ mental_health_refugees/en/. 10 general population; indeed, that war's psychiatric casualties outnumbered its physical by two to one.34 As Herman writes: One of the many casualties of the [First World War's] devastation was the illusion of manly honor and glory in battle. Under conditions of unremitting exposure to the horrors of trench warfare, men began to break down in shocking numbers. Confined and rendered helpless, subjected to constant threat of annihilation, and forced to witness the mutilation and death of their comrades without any hope of reprieve, many soldiers began to act like hysterical women. They screamed and wept uncontrollably. They froze and could not move. They became mute and unresponsive. They lost their memory and their capacity to feel.35 What military parlance initially termed \"shell shock\" - a hardy euphemism intended for PR purposes to minimize the condition's gravity - became undeniable evidence that partaking in and witnessing violence, living under perpetual threat of death, produced devastating psychic damage in the average human.36 By the aftermath of World War II, in which \"33% of all medical casualties were attributable to psychiatric causes,\"37 physicians generally agreed that \"any man could break down under fire and that psychiatric illness emerged in direct proportion to the severity of combat exposure.\" Two prominent American psychiatrists estimated that major trauma symptoms would surface predictably in even the prototypically \"brave\" soldier after 200-240 days in the trenches. \"Each moment of combat imposes a strain so great that men will break down in direct relation to the intensity and duration of their exposure,\" wrote J. W. Appel and G. W. Beebe, observing what modern medical lexicon calls a 'dose-effect response.' \"Thus psychiatric casualties are as inevitable as gunshot and shrapnel wounds in warfare,\" they concluded.38 34 R. F. Mollica, B. Lopes Cardozo, H. J. Osofsky, B. Raphael, A. Ager, P. and Salama, \"Mental Health in complex emergencies,\" Lancet 364 (2004): 2058. 35 Herman, Trauma and Recovery, 20. It should be noted that Herman uses the term \"hysterical women\" to refer to the common 19th century diagnosis of neurosis in traumatized women called \"hysteria.\" 36 Ibid. 37 Mollica et al., \"Mental health in complex emergencies,\" 2058. 38 See J. W. Appel and G. W. Beebe, \"Preventive Psychiatry: An Epidemiological Approach,\" Journal of the American Medical Association 131 (1946): 1468-71. Hereafter \"JAMA.\" See also Herman, Trauma and Recovery, 25. On dose-effect response as it 11 Only after the Vietnam War, though, did psychological science and will merge to produce systematic empirical investigations into the trauma of violence - this is the second major milestone on which today's call for mental health interventions in complex emergencies rests. During the 1970s, the protest organization Vietnam Veterans Against the War assembled frequent \"rap groups\" to compare battlefield stories and talk through their distressing symptoms. Recalls one marine: Family and friends wondered why we were so angry. What are you crying about? they would ask. Why are you so ill-tempered and disaffected. Our fathers and grandfathers had gone off to war, done their duty, come home and got on with it. What made our generation so different? As it turns out, nothing. No difference at all. When old soldiers from \"good\" wars are dragged from behind the curtain of myth and sentiment and brought into the light, they too seem to smolder with choler and alienation. So we were angry. Our anger was old, atavistic. We were angry as all civilized men who have ever been sent to make murder in the name of virtue were angry.39 Sympathetic psychiatrists like Robert Jay Lifton offered counsel and ran batteries of experiments with willing volunteers. By the end of the decade, a seminal five-volume study called Legacies of Vietnam made the case for a new psychiatric condition, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which worked its way in 1980 into the third revision of the US mental health bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).40 Ten years after the Vietnam War's end, by one estimate, fifteen percent of US veterans still suffered from a threshold level of PTSD's diagnostic relates to trauma, see R.

The results were mortifying. \"Sexual assaults against women and children were shown to be pervasive and endemic\" in the US; a now-classic epidemiological survey using random sampling demonstrated that \"one woman in four had been raped [and one] in three had been sexually abused in childhood.\"43 What clinicians previously had termed \"rape trauma syndrome\" - a loose diagnosis for nausea, insomnia, nightmares, startle responses, and dissociative or numbing symptoms - coincided precisely with the newly minted PTSD syndrome of returned vets. Traumatized soldiers had lived through the life-threatening event of war, fearing disfigurement and death. Victims of sexual violence too had survived an equally grave threat to their physical and mental integrity. Western psychological theory by the mid-1980s recognized trauma as trauma, whether the violence occurred on the battlefield or behind closed doors.44 Once it made intuitive sense that one need not be in the trenches to be scarred by violence, it was not long before the Western trauma model was invoked in studying war-affected 41 Mollica et al, \"Mental health in complex emergencies,\" 2058. 42 Herman, Trauma and Recovery, 28. 43 Diana E.

It was displaced populations - voiceless, marginalized, and invariably victims of violence - who received the most research attention because few groups by definition \"suffer [more] prolonged periods of insecurity and deprivation.\"45 \"The voluntary immigration experience, itself, because it involves losses, is a traumatic experience,\" asserts Vamik Volkan, \"[b]ut forced immigration includes the effects of actual trauma...[and it] is more difficult and often impossible for refugees and/or those who are exiled to complete the work of mourning.\"46 In 1988, the first ever on-site refugee mental health survey revealed rampant psychological illness inside the notoriously hellish 'Site 2' camp on the Thai-Cambodia border among those displaced by the Khmer Rouge genocide.47 These findings compelled UN involvement and prompted a high-level meeting to address disintegrating conditions there. The relief community took this as a wake-up call and implemented in the early 1990s a bevy of clumsily coordinated if well-intentioned psychosocial interventions in the Balkans.48 Meanwhile, studies trickled in that cautiously validated PTSD's applicability to the trauma experiences of the forcibly displaced.49 As Mollica cites in a sweeping literature review: A longitudinal study of Bosnian refugees revealed, for the first time, the serious disability associated with the mental health effects of mass violence. 45% of the refugees studied met DSM-IV criteria for depression or post-traumatic stress disorder or both, and when both were diagnosed there was a high rate of physical disability (45.5%).

Critics say that PTSD is hopelessly shackled to rational-analytical-individualistic Western values that have little relevance elsewhere: The Western industrial culture overemphasizes the self-assertive and neglects the integrative tendencies. This culture prefers rational over intuitive thinking, analysis over synthesis, reductionism over holistic approach and linear over nonlinear thinking. In terms of values, the Western culture favours expansion, competition, quantity and domination, and neglects conservation, cooperation, quality and partnership.57 54 Silove, \"Psychosocial Effects of Torture,\" 202.

Writes Silove: \"The protagonists of PTSD, it is claimed, risk \"medicalizing\" natural reactions to the age-old problem of war and social upheaval. Exporting to other cultures the alien notion of PTSD, and Western modalities of trauma treatment that accompany it, may undermine traditional social mechanisms that foster natural restitution. Exaggerating the priority of trauma counseling also may divert attention and financial aid from programmes that promote self-help and communal reconstruction in war-affected societies. Some of the shortcomings of this argument are [that] PTSD has been observed across cultures and contexts, and recent evidence suggests that only a minority of refugees suffer the disorder, so that it is inaccurate for either side of the debate to refer to these groups as a whole as being \"traumatized.\" Nevertheless, there is evidence that the minority with PTSD are at risk of long-term psychosocial disability.\" 57 Boris Drozdek, \"The Rebirth of Contextual Thinking in Psychotraumatology,\" in Voices of Trauma, 3. See also F. Capra, The web of life (New York: Anchor/Doubleday, 1996). 16 \"Western trauma theory,\" writes London Institute of Psychiatry's Derek Summerfield, \"which likens the brain to a machine and sees PTSD as the result of incomplete emotional and cognitive processing within that machine, cannot make sense in...settings\" where \"distress is commonly understood and expressed in terms of disruptions to the social and moral order and [where] internal emotional factors are not seen as able to cause illness.\"58 Leading cross-cultural psychiatrist Boris Drozdek agrees, maintaining that \"the PTSD concept...is a reduced one\" that \"does not take into account the whole spectrum of posttraumatic damage, including...the socio-political-cultural context in which trauma occurs.\" Culture, as Drozdek, Summerfield, and other likeminded colleagues argue, does not merely paint an exotic veneer onto some universal reaction to trauma. Rather, culture \"is central to how people respond to, comprehend, and recover from trauma.\"59 It indisputably colors and informs what and how humans think and feel,60 defining \"not only...pain and suffering,\" according to Cecil Helman, \"but also what is seen as private and public pain, what should be shared with others and what must remain a secret.\"61 Culture influences the \"regulation and expression of emotions, sets limits of tolerance of specific and strong emotions, and provides lay theories and strategies about handling emotions.\" It also \"shape[s] individual expressions and perceptions of how to suffer under stress.\"62 Drozdek delineates some of culture's other influences on mental health: [T]hrough socio- and psycho-physiological processes culture influences symptoms, course and outcome of PTSD, determines clinical presentation of problems and help-seeking behaviour. In addition, culture shapes the 58 Derek Summerfield, \"A critique of seven assumptions behind psychological trauma programmes in war-affected areas,\" Social Science and Medicine 48 (1999): 1455.

It also determines understanding and conceptualizing of suffering, as well as making of a hierarchy of values and needs that underlie decision-making, and influence expectations from support and treatment. Last but not least, culture shapes the therapist-patient relationship.63 Accordingly, trauma cannot be understood as the \"disembodied construct\" the DSM portrays it to be, but instead as a \"cultural and historical reality\" that assumes many forms and meanings throughout the world.64 Summerfield has been loudest in fulminating against PTSD's transplantation into every war-torn corner of the globe. He doggedly dismisses the belief that all violence is \"traumatic\" because he more broadly rejects \"[W]estern assumptions that very adverse events are bound to leave people with a psychological injury\" - this is, he asserts, a \"narrowly pathologising generalization\" for which he finds (contentiously, given the solid research reviewed above) \"no empirical basis.\"65 In Summerfield's judgment, violent conflict and displacement are common if regrettable facts of life for much of the world's population and therefore they cannot be regarded necessarily as \"outside the range of normal human experience,\" as the DSM defines a traumatic 63 Ibid., 8-9. 64 Ibid. The call for a culture-based reconceptualization of trauma evolved out of a long-simmering disquiet with the entire PTSD construct and its post-Vietnam, politicized history. A 1995 American Journal of Psychiatry editorial \"noted wryly that it was rare to find a psychiatric diagnosis that anyone liked to have, but that PTSD was one of them.\" Derek Summerfield rebukes over-broadening of truth\" of PTSD - a diagnosis that \"was as much a socio-political as a medical response to the problems of a particular group at a particular point in time.\" Summerfield writes: \"With the USA leading the way, PTSD has become important for many in civil society who are competing for victim status, and its associated moral high ground, in pursuit of recognition and compensation. The diagnosis, originally intended to apply only to the aftermath of events outside the range of ordinary human experience, has come to be applied to much more everyday encounters: a mugging, a difficult birth, a road accident, verbal sexual harassment and other experiences claimed to involve feelings of humiliation. The most recent reformulation of PTSD in the [DSM] makes it still easier to qualify by widening the definition of traumatic stressors to include the experience of hearing the news that something bad has happened to someone close.\" See N. C. Andreasen, \"Posttraumatic stress disorder: psychology, biology and the manichaean warfare between false dichotomies,\" American Journal of Psychiatry 152 (1995): 963-965; and Summerfield, critique of seven assumptions,\" 1450-51. 65 Derek Summerfield, \"The Impact of War and Atrocity on Civilian Populations: Basic Principles for NGO Interventions and a Critique of Psychosocial Trauma Projects,\" Network Paper 14, Relief and Rehabilitation Network (April 1996), 14-15. 18 event.66 \"For the vast majority of survivors,\" he writes, \"'traumatization' is a pseudo-condition; distress or suffering per se is not a psychological disturbance\"67 because [s]uffering is at the centre of the social order and in this sense is 'normal.' Violent conflict is part of social experience and memory. We should not assume that the stresses of war are necessarily discontinuous with those arising from other sources of social destabilization, including endemic poverty.68 Largely unaccustomed to collective violence, the sheltered Western psychologist or psychiatrist sees war as \"a sort of mental health emergency\" that invariably unleashes a \"hidden epidemic\" of posttraumatic stress, as if the latter were \"an entity as real and concrete as an infectious agent and as capable of causing pathology on a large scale.\"69 Resultingly, \"the psychological concepts and practices which the expatriate-led psychosocial projects are importing into developing country settings\" - from one-on-one therapeutic 'debriefing' (used to discharge distressing emotions), to talk therapies seeking to reconstruct a victim's so-called 'sense of self' - are \"as Western of laughably little use to culturally-diverse populations.70 Summerfield sees other faulty assumptions behind psychosocial interventions in complex emergencies, and they bear scrutiny here because his attempts to refute them - taken to their extreme - imply that few, if any, such interventions are warranted even in the most severely blighted populations. Where interveners assume that \"large numbers of victims traumatized by war need professional help,\" Summerfield sees resilience winning out over pathology: All over the world huge numbers of ordinary, unremarkable people demonstrate a capacity to tenaciously endure, adapt and transcend. To honour this is not to play down what has been done to them and how they have suffered. Theirs is a largely unspectacular example which does not attract media or other attention and analysis, but it begs a resonant 66 DSM, 467. 67 Summerfield, \"Impact of War and Atrocity,\" 14-15. 68 1453. Summerfield, \"Impact of War and Atrocity,\" 18. 19 question: this is not how or why some individuals become psychological casualties, but how or why the vast majority do not.71 Outsider-initiated mental health programs that presume mass traumatization after violence necessarily place \"the [psychological] 'expert' and the expertise at the centre of things\" and relegate the traumatized person to \"the role of consumer patient,\" a \"passive victim rather than active survivor.\" Where interveners assume that \"victims do better if they emotionally ventilate and 'work through' their experiences,\" Summerfield sees the Freudian paradigm run amok. He indicates that \"many non-Western cultures have little place for the revelation of intimate material outside a close family circle,\" and he criticizes the Western clinical impulse to locate the crux of both wounding and healing within the individual instead of within his social context. \"War is a collective experience,\" he argues, \"and perhaps its primary impact on victims is through their witnessing the destruction of a social world embodying their history, identity and living values and roles.\" And where interveners assume \"there are vulnerable groups and individuals who need to be specifically targeted for psychological help,\" Summerfield sees an exaggerated stratification of victims that \"risk[s] disconnecting them from others in their community and from the wider context of their experiences and the meanings given to them.\" In conclusion, he proclaims, \"[w]ar-affected people have not given permission for their personal psychology to be objectified and until they do so it is not the business of the humanitarian field.\"72 For all of Summerfield's useful critiques, this author believes he is throwing the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. It is true that even the best-intentioned psychosocial intervention, if poorly grounded in the local culture, can do more harm than good - with potentially \"negative 71 Summerfield, \"Impact of War and seven assumptions,\" 1454-56, 1459. 20 effects on survivors' meaning systems and traditional coping strategies at the very point when these are damaged and destabilized.\"73 As Mollica writes: [M]isguided attempts at psychosocial assistance to traumatized persons can be extremely destructive, short-circuiting the self-healing process and creating real disease and illness. It is essential that all assistance be evaluated as to its ultimate beneficial or harmful impact on individuals and the community. Not everyone who has been injured by violence wants to be aided in a way that may be culturally insensitive or disruptive to their natural self-healing capacity. For example, traumatized persons resent the automatic assumption that their history of violence requires that they undergo therapy in order to be normal.\"74 Further, it is also true that programs seeking only to relieve acute distress, without cultivating a community's capacity to heal itself over the longterm, will leave a population confused and psychologically stranded when the intervention team packs up and parachutes back home. But this does not mean that psychosocial interventions in complex emergencies are not ethically warranted when a population has little or no access to mental health care. It does not mean that interventions cannot be made exceptionally culturally-sensitive, drawing on the expertise of local healers and staying loyal to the essence of what a particular community believes about wellness and illness, functionality and non-functionality, purpose and meaning, life and death. And it does not mean that interventions cannot seek to integrate individual-level healing from violence (coined \"PTSD\" or not) with broader social healing, incorporating where appropriate Western \"technical-medical\" knowledge while concurrently \"acknowledging the link...people make between well-being and their stake in equitable and culturally competent environments.\"75 As Ager notes, one need not (and should not) choose between individual- and social-level healing; \"[o]ne can acknowledge 73 Ibid., Mollica, Invisible Wounds, 236. See also Mollica, et al., \"Mental health in 2058-67. relocation,\" 231-6. 21 the social determinants of mental ill-health, whilst still attempting to assist individuals whose psychological adjustment has been influenced by past and present traumatic stress.\"76 Most importantly, we must remember that cross-cultural psychological research is in its relative infancy. Lack of definitive proof that some universal trauma reaction exists does not mean that there are no underlying commonalities across cultures in how humans experience pain and manifest suffering, and it does not mean that the mentally anguished do not need care, whether it comes from within their own community or from expatriate-led humanitarian initiatives. Indeed, evidence is mounting that traumatic stress is not simply a politicized Western construct: The core symptoms of posttraumatic reactions are also much more similar than different in all cultures. [...] Scientific evidence, especially neurobiological studies, have documented that affect dysregulation, right hemisphere alterations in brain functioning, and strong kindling phenomena are universal in PTSD. [...] Victims describe having problems re-experiencing traumatic events, having nightmares and intrusive thoughts. They are suffering from hyper-arousal, including poor sleep, poor concentration, and irritability. Avoidance symptoms are also common, especially those involving reminders that trigger memories of the past and violence. In addition, depressive symptoms seem to be universal in all the cultural groups.77 \"Although opinions vary widely on the public health value of focusing on PTSD and trauma services,\" writes Mark van Ommeren in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization, \"there is agreement on basic issues: exposure to extreme stressors is a risk factor for social and mental health problems, including common mental disorders; further, emergencies can severely disrupt social structures and ongoing formal and informal care of persons with pre-existing disorders. A 76 Ager, \"Mental Health Issues in Refugee Populations,\" 25. 77 Drozdek, \"Rebirth of Contextual Thinking in Psychotraumatology,\" 9. \"Kindling\" refers to a phenomenon by which a progressively lower threshold of stressors produces the same symptoms in a PTSD (or bipolar) patient. \"Initial affective episodes in patients...are often related to psychological stressors, but after several episodes appear to require less and less of a trigger, until finally they begin occurring spontaneously.\" See \"Kindling as a Cause of Biploar?,\" available at: http://www.angelfire.com/home/bphoenix1/kindling.html 22 range of strategies seems to have wide support of much expert opinion, on the condition that they are tailored to the local context, needs and resources.\"78 Violence, however de rigueur it may be in an individual's life or society, always hurts. An IDP who has forcibly relocated time and again, each trip inflicting another layer of losses - of belongings, family members, friends, hope - does not remain psychologically unscathed simply because resettling has become his way of life, any more than an American scraping by on minimum wage remains mentally healthy so long as she takes time to reflect on the constancy of destitution in her life. Further, though slicing up a population with blanket categorizations ('Women are more prone to emotional breakdown than men') is counterproductive, certain populations will always need more psychological attention than others. It is grasping at technical straws to claim for example, as Summerfield does, that women do not merit especial focus because \"[t]here is little medical literature to justify the conviction that rape per se is a discrete cause of psychological vulnerability in conditions of war.\"79 While there may not exist specific studies that perfectly isolate rape's unique psychological damage in a war context, it is irresponsibly cerebral (not to mention astoundingly cold-hearted) to claim that a woman ashamed to come forward with her story of sexual violence is tacitly dismissing her experience as not that big a deal. Such a woman - however endemic rape is in her culture and however much we lack red-letter proof that rape traumatizes in precisely the same manner from culture to culture - likely could benefit from a culturally-sensitive mental health intervention.80 Benedetto health during and after acute emergencies: emerging consensus?\" Bulletin of the World Health Organization 83, no. 1 (January 2005): 72. 79 Summerfield, Impact of War and Atrocity,\" 21. 80 On sexual violence and mental health, see for example, Marian Tankink and Annemiek Richters, \"Silence as a Coping Strategy: The Case of Refugee Women in the Netherlands from South-Sudan who Experienced Sexual Violence in the Context of War,\" in Voices of Trauma, 191-210. 23 Summerfield states, with some accuracy, that \"no general case has yet been made for mental health to be seen as an appropriate realm for humanitarian operations for war-affected populations.\"81 This paper seeks to contribute to making that case, by examining how psychosocial interventions in one especially traumatized population - Sudan's internally displaced - can be infused with cultural sensitivity. Part Two contextualizes the country's crisis of forced migration, surveys its anemic mental health services, and delves deeper into the psychological fallout of the displacement experience to solidify a moral imperative to intervene where there is nowhere for the traumatized to turn. Part Three will move from theory to practice: it investigates how mental health interventions in Sudan can be made exceptionally culturally sensitive through deeper understanding of Sudanese conceptions and manifestations of mental distress. It serves as a practical guide for psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, and other helping professionals who participate in internationally-led psychosocial programs in Sudan's IDP camps. seven assumptions,\" 1461. 24 II: Concretizing the Case for Mental Health Interventions in Sudan Home to Africa's longest civil war, Sudan has a tortured past: four decades of near-continuous and bloody conflict between the country's north and south - not to mention the eruption of genocide in Darfur - has claimed over two million lives, displaced as many as six million more, ravaged the nation's infrastructure, halted its economic and political growth, and destabilized the entire Horn of Africa.82 At the heart of this destruction has been a clash of labyrinthine ethnic, religious, political, and cultural identities: Arab versus non-Arab, Muslim versus Christian/animist, nomadic versus sedentary, enfranchised versus marginalized, center versus periphery. Sudan is a nation in profound identity crisis - it is, in Deng's words, \"in painful search of itself.\"83 This section makes the case for mental health interventions in the Sudanese displaced more concrete by contextualizing the country's forced migration catastrophe, offering a more nuanced framework for understanding how displacement impacts its victims psychologically, and surveying the existing state mental health service capacities (or lack thereof). It is worth beginning with a brief outline of Sudan's saga of unrest to get a fuller picture of the multigenerational transmission of trauma there. This is a country whose collective memory knows practically nothing but grief and loss.84 Sudan's intricate and bewildering tapestry of cohabiting identities has made it highly susceptible to internal strife. Though the country's ethnic makeup is often reduced to an \"African- 82 Sudan's civil strife includes a constellation of smaller tribal conflicts as well as the present genocide in Darfur; these of course stem in part from the fundamental clash between the north and the south. The controversial label of \"genocide\" is now quite universally agreed upon.

Deng, \"Sudan: A Nation in Turbulent Search of Itself,\" The Annals of the American Academy, vol. 603 (January 2006). 84 This, and the next 5 paragraphs, adapted from Brian T.

Confusing the picture further, ethnic lines are distinctly blurred. While the north predominantly identifies as Arab-Muslim, for example, most northerners are racially undifferentiated from the black peoples of the south (and because of this, cling all the more ferociously to their Arab identity).85 Likewise there is a long tradition of tribal intermarriage, for example, between the Ngok Dinka and the Misseriya in the Abyei region that bridges the north and south.86 It is thus not difficult to appreciate the immense challenge of coexistence that has faced Sudan ever since its days as a patchwork of independent kingdoms and principalities.87 The north-south conflict. Sudan's civil war88 broke out in reaction to a massive and chronic power imbalance between the center and periphery of the country, an imbalance that both reflected and perpetuated culturally entrenched ethno-religious discrimination against non-Arabs and non-Muslims. By the nineteenth century Sudan had become a nation cleaved along identity lines, as the Arab/Muslim north hoarded state power and the indigenously African, 85 Deng, \"Sudan: A Nation in Turbulent Search of Itself,\" 157, 160. 86 Personal field observations in Abyei. 87 For a discussion of root and proximate causes, see Luka Biong Deng, \"The Sudan Comprehensive Peace Agreement: Will It Be Sustained?\" Civil Wars 7, no. 3 (Autumn 2005): 245. Says Deng, \"Importantly since independence in 1956, governance and development in Sudan have been increasingly characterized by urban bias and highly centralized regimes that were seen to favour the populations living around the capital city and in the riverine areas. The main root causes of the apparent conflict between the centre and rural Sudan are linked with the structural marginalization, exclusion and neglect of the majority rural Sudanese in the public affairs of the country and decision making. More proximate causes included increased centralization of power with smaller elites, failure to implement and honour previous peace agreements, and the use of religion and ethnicity to monopolise power and divide the communities.\" 88 It has become common to regard Sudan's two major civil wars (1955-1972 and 1983-2005) as one continuous civil war (1955-2005) broken up by a decade-long ceasefire; I will do so here. 26 Christian/animist south grew increasingly marginalized. Two incompatible visions for Sudan emerged - one Arab-Islamic, one secular black - that strained the nation's unity.89 Ethnic polarization bred overt prejudice. As Deng argues, \"the normative framework [in Sudan] provided that a person who was a Muslim, Arabic-speaking, culturally Arabized, and could claim Arab descent was elevated to a position of respect and dignity, while in sharp contrast, a non-Muslim black African was deemed inferior, a heathen, and a legitimate target of enslavement.\"90 Indeed, southerners were routinely captured and sold into servitude by northern slave traders.91 Beginning in 1899, the joint British-Egyptian administration exacerbated these inequities by pouring resources into the north's political and economic development, while allowing the south to stagnate and flounder. After World War II, the British pressured the south to adopt Islam and declared that Arabic would replace English as the south's official language. Enduring these years of political disenfranchisement, economic disparity, cultural bigotry, psychological humiliation, and ideological persecution stoked in the southern Sudanese a deep sense of injustice, alienation, and mistrust that finally erupted in 1955 at the dawn of the country's independence from British-Egyptian rule.92 There were two major triggers for the initial outbreak of violence: first, the southern Sudanese were essentially shut out of civil service and administration posts in the transition from condominium to independence, and second, the Arab-dominated government turned its back on promises to establish a federal system that would have granted southerners much-craved autonomy. In response to these final two grievances, a corps of southern troops mutinied. Within months 89 See \"Background Note: Sudan,\" U. S.

Seventeen years of fighting (and three coups d'\u00e9tats) later, both sides signed a peace agreement at Addis Ababa in March 1972 that finally answered the south's demands for regional autonomy.93 The peace proved tragically short-lived. In 1983 President Nimeiri unilaterally scrapped the Addis Ababa agreement, forced Shari'a law on the whole of Sudan, and divvied up the south into three distinct regions to be placed under northern control - all without conducting a constitutionally-mandated referendum. Nimeiri was motivated both by religion (he sought to transform the country into a fully Muslim state) and by economics (he also coveted southern Sudan's exceptionally fertile land and newly-discovered oil fields). Cheated out of the autonomy they had enjoyed for a decade, subjected again to Islamic crusading and draconian Shari'a justice, and now deprived of their natural resources, an insurrection calling itself the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) launched a bloody uprising against the north that plunged Sudan once again into chaos and carnage that lasted until the signing of a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2005.94 Today, the CPA is in critical jeopardy of losing legitimacy as all stakeholders are playing fast and loose with their commitments to it and violence flares anew in the hotly contested Abyei region.95 The best that can be said about the north-south conflict's \"resolution\" is that it is exceedingly tenuous. Peace dividends appear to be growing scarcer, not stronger.96 93 \"Background Note: Sudan.\" See Civil War,\" GlobalSecurity.org, available at http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/sudan-civil-war.htm. 94 Ibid. 95 See, for example, \"Sudan: rising tension in Abyei as clashes displace hundreds,\" Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN), 22 March 2008. 96 The latest ICG report outlines the grave threats to the CPA's implementation.

The conflagration in Darfur - described by Jan Egeland as \"the world's worst humanitarian disaster\" and by the US as \"genocide\" - began as a peripherally related offshoot of the north-south war but since 2003 has taken on a grim life of its own.97 International media and scholarship has publicized the story widely. Drought and desertification over the twentieth century exacerbated long-simmering tensions between pastoralists and nomads over preciously scarce resources. Non-Arabs, who accused Khartoum of marginalizing and oppressing them, assembled into rebel groups (the Justice and Equality Movement and the Sudanese Liberation Army) that began airing their grievances aggressively.98 Preoccupied with fighting the SPLA in the south, the government armed Darfurian Arab militiamen called janjawiid (\"devils on horseback\") to quash the insurrection as they pleased.99 Write Julie Flint and Alex de Waal, \"[d]rought and destitution embittered the Darfur Arabs[, and w]eapons and a self-asserting ideology gave them new aggression and confidence. They were ripe for picking by the government, which began to harness them as a proxy instrument of military control.\"100 It was a campaign of ethnic cleansing, and outsourcing it to the janjawiid meant the government could target rebel and civilian alike behind a smokescreen: In the beginning, Khartoum's use of tribal militias was purely opportunistic: they were there, they had fighting skills and they allowed the government to conserve its own, overstretched resources. But as time went on, and jihad was unleashed, the militias served a second, equally 97 Julie Flint & Alex de Waal, Darfur: A Short History of a Long War (London: Zed Books, 2005), xii; Peter Verney, \"FMO Country Guide: Sudan\" (Forced Migration Online, 2006), 8, available at: http://www.forcedmigration.org/guides/fmo040/. 98 In February 2003, they \"launched attacks on police and military targets, including El Fasher airport.\" Interestingly, reports the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), \"[r]ebel leaders in Darfur saw the progress in the north-south negotiations as confirmation that violence would bring the government to the negotiating table.\" See IDMC, \"Outlook for IDPs 13; available at: http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004BE3B1/(httpInfoFiles)/ 49874F0D85987B75C1257372004EEEA6/$file/Sudan+-October+2007.pdf. 99 Khartoum had a history of employing the janjawiid: \"in 1988...the government decided to arm the nomadic groups against an incursion by the [SPLA] in Darfur. This move disrupted the local balance of power and rendered local resolution mechanisms obsolete. Most of the government-supported perpetrators of the current violence and displacement in Darfur come from the tribes that were armed to fight the SPLM/A in the late 1980s.\" See Ibid. 100 Flint and de Waal, Darfur: A Short History, 57. 29 important function: they gave the government the cover of 'age-old tribal conflict,' enabling it to deny there was a civil war at all.101 Today, Darfur is the world's nucleus of misery, \"defined by ubiquitous abuse and human suffering,\" where hundreds of thousands have lost their lives and countless more must scrape out the \"barest of existences in remote and often under-stocked and under-protected camps,\"102 living \"from day to day and from hand to mouth, cut off from traditional livelihoods.\"103 Bearing witness to the horrifying accounts of Darfurians offers only the most superficial of glances into the psychic trauma of those who are forced to spend each day evading slaughter: The janjawiid came in without the army and burnt 50 per cent of the town. They took the cattle and killed forty-two men, most of them young men. There was a funeral that day for an 80-year-old man,...people were in the mosque reading prayers for him. Sixteen people were killed in the mosque. The imam...ran from the mosque to his home to get his 3-year-old grandson, who was an orphan. The Janjawiid followed him. They killed him and the child. They burned 80 out of 300 huts and stole more than 3,000 cows.104 Reports de Waal: Government and Janjawiid forces destroyed everything that made life possible. Food that could be carried away was; the rest was burned. Animals that could be taken away were; the rest were killed. The simple straw buildings that served as clinics and schools were destroyed, usually simply with matches, and everything in them was stolen or torched. Pumps were smashed and wells polluted - often with corpses. Mosques were burned and Qurans desecrated.105 The death and destruction in Sudan's no-man's-land continues, unabated. 101 Ibid., 57. 102 Erin Patrick, \"Intent to Destroy: The Genocidal Impact of Forced Migration in Darfur, Sudan\" Journal of Refugee Studies 18, no. 4 (2005): 410. 103 Flint and de Waal, Darfur: A Short History, 57. 104 Interview with Ahmad Abdalla Israel Yahya in Cherkerio, April 2004, quoted in Ibid., 105. 105 Flint and de Waal, Darfur: A Short History, 111-112. 30 An unprecedented crisis of forced migration. Recurring clashes over power, religion, and resources have made Sudan the world's epicenter of forced migration, history's most dire crisis of human displacement. One-sixth of the population - about six million Sudanese - have been uprooted, two million by the Darfur genocide alone. Displacement has a long history in Sudan. Upon seizing power in 1989, President Omar el-Bashir began clearing out huge pockets of the country both as a strategic weapon against southern rebels and as a means of seizing huge oases of oil-soaked land. \"Since [oil's] discovery in 1979,\" reports scholar Peter Verney, \"governments in Khartoum have wanted the oil zones to be occupied by a compliant population, and sought the destruction of the rebels' support base...[; i]nitially this involved only proxy militias armed by the government, but oil money soon enabled the purchase of military hardware, including helicopter gunships, jet fighters and bombers.\" In the ensuing years, militias looted, burned, and abducted women and children as they secured the oil, while Antonov planes and helicopter gunships attacked from the air when necessary. Thus displacement morphed from a side effect of Sudan's perennial warring to a \"military and economic objective in its own right.\"106 Bashir's scorched-earth campaign commandeered huge tracts of terrain at the gravest expense of its inhabitants, of course. \"Previously self-sustaining village populations\" of small farmers and nomads, writes Verney, transformed instantly \"into vulnerable and dependent communities deprived of their right to land and permanent shelter, living precariously on the periphery of the capital.\"107 Concomitantly, a \"coherent and systematic policy of social engineering,\" eerily named the 'Civilization Project,' actively sought to destroy the cultural roots of the displaced populations, with the establishment of camps known as 'Peace Villages.' These became 106 Verney, \"FMO Country Guide: Sudan,\" 1-2. 107 Ibid. 31 notorious for separating families - most of whose menfolk were killed - allowing militiamen to rape with impunity, and intensive indoctrination. The outcome was the creation of a large and vulnerable population of dispossessed people with diminished rights.108 According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), Sudan's IDPs - who number around 4.5 million - \"[continue] to be subjected to widespread killings, rapes, looting and other human rights abuses,\" while \"[h]umanitarian conditions in the hundreds of IDP camps are worsening, [with] malnutrition rates...above emergency levels.\" In Darfur particularly, \"access for humanitarian organizations has worsened, with over a million people out of reach of urgently needed assistance as a result of deteriorating security conditions.\"109 Those IDPs (especially around Khartoum) who manage to escape camp squalor to return to the homes they long ago fled do not enjoy unequivocally better fates than those who don't make the trek. \"Some of the returning IDPs have found the conditions worse in their areas of origin...[due to] lack of livelihood opportunities, insecurity, extortion, drought, and lack of services\", reports the IDMC, \"and have decided to go back again to the squalid conditions in the north.\"110 In effect, multiple waves of eviction, resettlement, and return over many decades have turned contemporary Sudan into a stormy sea of competing land claims, where \"returning refugees...[sometimes clash] violently with IDPs occupying land which was formerly theirs.\"111 Alleviating the IDP crisis will require good-faith collaboration between the post-CPA central government (the Government of National Unity) and the Government of South Sudan, something which anyone following the CPA's implementation knows is in miserably short order. \"The latter is willing to support the return and reintegration of IDPs, but desperately lacks the resources,\" writes Verney, while \"[t]he government 108 Ibid., 6. 109 See IDMC, \"Outlook for IDPs remains bleak,\" 13. For more detailed IDP statistics and a brief discussion of difficulties in obtaining accurate figures in Sudan, see Appendix 2. 110 Ibid., 12-13. 111 Verney, \"FMO Country Guide: Sudan), 26. 32 in Khartoum has the resources, but lacks the will to put them at the disposal of the populations it has played a role in displacing.\" Until both sides merge resources and will, millions of IDPs will continue to suffer the predictable and insidious mental health deterioration that can accompany forced migration. Mental distress and disorder in the displaced: manifestation and prevalence. Making the case for mental health interventions in the Sudanese displaced requires moving beyond the confining rubric of PTSD, the nexus of transcultural psychological debate. This is not to understate this diagnostic category's potential utility in understanding migratory stress; indeed, one respected epidemiological estimate holds that between 40 and 70 percent of displaced persons suffer some form of psychopathology in the short term - usually acute clinical depression or PTSD - as a result of their displacement.112 And this is not to disavow critics who claim that Western descriptions of traumatic stress, like the following, are useless to the concrete needs of Sudanese IDPs: The alternative of psychoformative processes may lead to a de-centering of the self, a loss of groundedness and a sense of sameness and continuity. In extreme cases, a radical discontinuity may occur in ego-identity, leaving scars to the inner agency of the psyche. Fragmentation of ego-identity has consequences for psychological stability, well-being, and psychic integration, resulting in proneness to dissociation.113 But endlessly debating the merits of PTSD's cross-cultural applicability before intervening in low-income, conflict-torn countries is like watching a house burn and idly arguing whether faulty wiring or a cigarette was the cause. It does not require epidemiological meta-analyses or impenetrable psychodynamic theories to know that Sudanese IDPs need psychosocial care. Even 112 Florence Baingana, Ian Bannon and Rachel Thomas, \"Mental Health and Conflicts: Conceptual Framework and Approaches,\" World Bank Health, Nutrition and Population (Human Development Network) Discussion Paper (Washington, D.C.: World Bank, 2005), 6-7. 113 J. P. Wilson, M. J. Friedman, and J. D. Lindy, Treating psychological trauma and PTSD (New York: Guildford Publications, 2001), 30. 33 presuming that only a small fraction of the displaced manifest full-scale mental disorders, the majority develops some degree of mental distress that does not meet the threshold for psychopathology but is nonetheless severely debilitating.114 As Mollica reports, \"[a]lthough not every individual will suffer from serious mental illness requiring acute psychiatric care, the vast majority will experience low-grade but long-lasting problems.\"115 Displacement creates a continuum of psychic pain. After any traumatic event - across cultures and populations - some will remain mentally healthy, some will suffer moderately, and some will become crippled with serious psychological illness.116 This diagram usefully conceptualizes this distribution of symptoms: Figure: The Relationship between Mental Disorders and Psychosocial Distress in Post-Conflict Settings117 114 Terminology can become muddled here. Medical literature generally invokes \"mental (or psychiatric) disorder\" to mean a full-scale, gravely debilitating psychopathological illness like schizophrenia or major depression (both of which are recognized internationally), while \"mental distress\" encompasses more common psychological disturbances like traumatic grief and anxiety that can be seriously debilitating, but do not rise to the level of clinical psychopathology. 115 Mollica, \"Invisible Wounds,\" 57. 116 Much has been written on protective and risk factors for developing PTSD after trauma. Writes Silove, for example, \"Vulnerability and protective factors may influence the individual's response to trauma. For example, female gender and past psychiatric history appear to be risk factors to PTSD in [the displaced]. Religious faith, a sense of commitment to a political cause, and psychological preparation for torture all appear to provide some protection against adverse psychological consequences. In the post traumatic context, loss of social networks and separation from family members are important factors that appear to perpetuate psychiatric symptoms, particularly of depression, but also of PTSD. Age, language proficiency, social and economic adversity, and fear of repatriation appear to be influential in preventing recovery from PTSD and other forms of psychosocial distress in [the displaced].\" See Silove, \"Psychosocial Effects of 202. 117 Baingana et al., \"Mental Health and Conflicts,\" 22. 34 Esoteric PTSD debates reside in this pyramid's tiny top segment, but there is ample suffering in its base to warrant culturally-sensitive psychosocial interventions. Florence Baingana, a mental health specialist for the World Bank, argues that the displaced face the dual Herculean tasks of \"coming to grips with what has occurred and adjusting to life [that is] foreign and inhospitable.\" Here, she highlights the two distinct yet interlocking traumatic phases of displacement: \"the trauma associated with the violence of conflict experienced prior to displacement,\" and the traumatic aftermath of the displacement itself.118 One might analogize phase one, or pre-migration trauma, as slow-burning embers of suffering under increasingly oppressive communal insecurity and violence. Migration is rarely an impulsive decision, as refugee scholar Charles Kemp reminds us, but rather one impelled by many months and perhaps years of escalating victimization or threat. This is, of course, especially true in Sudan. \"Most [displaced persons] are reluctant to leave their homes and thus wait until there is no choice,\" he writes. \"Events may suddenly occur, e.g., a successful offensive, and families [are] forced to leave with only what they can immediately pick up and carry,\" forcing choices between precious possessions and even people. Moreover, \"[s]omewhere along in the process of leaving - before, during, after, or throughout - there is usually brutality.\"119 The brutality can take many forms: Home and possessions are destroyed or left behind. [...] Family members are separated, wounded, or killed. [... Among IDPs, a history of] imprisonment is common and being held in isolation tends to [have even] more traumatic [effects. ...] Rape and other assaults are far more [prevalent among the displaced] than generally reported and [so is] torture..., [including] beating, electrical shock..., burning, asphyxiation, stretching, genital trauma,...threats, isolation, mock execution, forced witnessing of torture or execution, and sleep deprivation. [...] Combat atrocities[,] including bombing, explosions, and other means of mass killing are very 118 Ibid., 5-6 119 Charles Kemp, \"Refugee Mental Health,\" 4, available online at: http://www3.baylor.edu/~Charles_Kemp/refugee_mental_health.htm. 35 common [events in the pre-flight lives of the displaced,] who may witness multiple killings extended over time.120 All these experiences - political repression, detention, torture, enduring the disappearance of or separation from relatives, and more fundamental uncertainty and hardship - bring about \"a shattered illusion of safety and a penetrating awareness of vulnerability.\"121 The moment of flight transforms the lives of the displaced irreversibly; it upends reality and inflicts irrevocable losses. Instantaneously, \"[a] lifetime of memories, familiarity, and accomplishment is abandoned and a completely new and often incomprehensible and hostile world is entered.\"122 This hostile world - of arduous, dehydrated treks and wretched, dangerous camps - brings an entirely new layer of traumatization. After uprooting, the displaced abruptly lose both their daily routines of self-sufficiency (planting, herding, etc.) and their valued social support systems (local healers, village networks, etc.). \"Stateless and displaced people are generally unable to engage in productive activities,\" Baingana notes. \"Often, there are no social safety nets, or those that exist are already overtaxed, so there is nothing to stop those affected by conflict from sliding into poverty or dependence on humanitarian assistance.\"123 When self-reliant people are forced to become other-reliant or are left stranded of support entirely, profound feelings of impotence usually emerge. In a survey of displaced Bosnian adults, for example, 25 percent stated \"they were no longer able to play a useful role in life,\" and 16 percent \"had lost all confidence in themselves and their capacity to manage their situation.\"124 As time passes and the uncertainty of 120 Ibid.

I use a Bosnian example here because there are no equivalent surveys of Sudanese displaced. 36 displacement grows, IDPs often begin \"suppressing or repressing feelings and normal responses to circumstances,\" a phenomenon known as numbing.125 This dissociated state often gives way to existential anguish. \"Trauma impacts the psychic core of the very soul of the survivor and generates a search for meaning as to why the event had to happen,\" writes PTSD pioneer John P. Wilson. \"A state of dispiritedness may cause a profound questioning of existence and force belief systems to change.\"126 It is worth underscoring here that Sudanese IDPs (indeed, all those who flee collective violence) grapple with markedly different psychological tasks than do those displaced by natural disasters. Not only must the former come to terms with the fact that fellow humans have caused their suffering, they often must endure knowing that they have been direct targets of ethnic hatred. Tsunamis come from out of the blue and don't discriminate, but the janjawiid know precisely what they are doing and single out non-Arabs.127 Predictably, displaced populations manifest chronic distress - fear, nervousness, flashbacks, nightmares, sleeplessness, anger, aggressiveness - far more prevalently than acute disorders like PTSD or psychosis.128 \"[H]opelessness and helplessness associated with persistent insecurity, statelessness and poverty\" is the breeding ground such distress symptoms; in the worst cases these can exacerbate one another with insidious circularity, \"leading to suicide ideation and attempts, chronic alcohol and drug abuse, interpersonal violence, and other signs of social dysfunction.\" In turn, there are usually \"decreased productivity [and] poor nutritional, health and educational outcomes for the children of mothers with these problems.\"129 125 Kemp, \"Refugee Mental Health,\" 4. On numbing, see for example Bessel A. van Der Kolk and Jose Saporta, \"The biological response to psychic trauma: Mechanisms and treatment of intrusion and numbing,\" Anxiety, Stress & Coping 4, no. 3 (1991): 199-212. 126 See John P. Wilson, \"The Broken Spirit: Posttraumatic Damage to the Self,\" in Broken Spirits, 111. 127 van der Veer, Counselling and Therapy with Refugees, 5. 128 Baingana et al., \"Mental Health and Conflicts,\" 22. 129 Ibid., 6. 37 Culturally-inclusive models of displacement trauma. As the above begins to make evident, the trauma of displacement does not have to be shackled to Western biomedicine; there are culturally-inclusive ways of understanding it. Mindy Fullilove, for example, writes penetratingly on \"the psychology of place.\" Here, 'place' is \"understood as the sum of resources and human relationships in a given location,\" and comprises three meanings: it is a \"viable setting [that provides] people with ready, equitable access to food, water, and safe shelter,\" a \"psychosocial milieu\" of human interactions occurring therein, and also \"the nodes of the life biography.\" To extrapolate: a Sudanese man from Khartoum regards his capital city as a physical and geographical locale, and more subconsciously as the stage upon which all his social and familial relationships play themselves out and as a tangible representation of his entire life story. Fullilove argues that because humans universally crave belonging to a place, which provides a deep sense of security, displacement \"ruptures [the] emotional connections\" of familiarity (\"intimate knowledge of the immediate environment\"), attachment (those inner bonds to one's surroundings that provide protection and satisfaction), and identity (the sense of occupying a place within one's place that is \"held in esteem by others\"). Displacement, with its \"ensuing disorientation, nostalgia, and alienation[,] may undermine the sense of belonging, in particular, and mental health, in general, Fullilove concludes.\"130 Derrick Silove offers a further culturally-inclusive and socially-grounded model of displacement trauma, that of \"adaptive Silove believes that \"extreme trauma represent[s a] fundamental [challenge] to one or more of the major adaptive systems that support a state of psychosocial equilibrium in individuals and their communities.\" The first and perhaps most self- 130 Mindy Thompson Fullilove, \"Psychiatric Implications of Displacement: Contributions from the Psychology of Place,\" The American Journal of Psychiatry 153, no. 12 (Dec. 1996): 1516-1523. 38 evident is the safety system, because \"refugees, asylum seekers, and war-affected populations often are subjected to multiple threats both concurrent with the initial trauma and for prolonged periods thereafter.\" The displaced also suffer a breakdown of their attachment system: One of the key disruptions caused by torture, war trauma, and refugee experiences is the impact on the survivor's interpersonal bonds. Separations and losses often are multiple and include actual and symbolic losses. Apart from deceased or missing family members...[and lost] possessions[, m]ore subtle losses experienced by [the displaced] include those of a sense of belonging, of social cohesion, of connection with the land and ancestors, and of culture and traditions.131 Third, the IDP's justice system comes under attack; indeed, the very experience of displacement is a human rights abuse, creating wells of festering anger in those forced to migrate. \"[S]urvivors may become trapped in a vicious spiral,\" writes Silove, \"in which loss of control of rage leads to enactment of the very aggression they detest, thereby intensifying their feelings of shame, guilt, desolation, and despair.\" Fourth, as discussed earlier, a displaced person's existential-meaning system is threatened. \"Exposure to inexplicable evil and cruelty can shake the foundations of the survivor's faith in the beneficence of life and humankind,\" often placing forced migrants on a ceaseless quest to \"find a coherent reason for the abuses they have suffered.\" Resultantly, they \"face a crisis of trust, faith, and meaning that may intensify feelings of alienation and emotional isolation.\" Finally, the displaced undergo a breakdown of their identity/role system during both phases of migratory trauma: before flight, they likely had lived under repressive conditions of \"[i]ndoctrination, propaganda, ostracism, and isolation, all...techniques that oppressive regimes use to undermine the sense of cohesion and identity of individual dissidents as well as entire communities.\" After flight, \"[t]he anonymity and dependency associated with being an inmate in a...camp or a detention center, the lack of recognition of previous roles, status, and qualifications\" 131 Silove, \"Psychosocial Effects of Torture,\" 204. 39 in camp life, and \"the disruption to cultural continuity brought about by displacement all act to compound such threats to identity.\"132 Silove's framework perfectly demonstrates that beneath and alongside the cold biomedical PTSD model, there is a wellspring of Western psychological insights that prove exceptionally valuable in understanding displacement trauma across cultures. For example, his identity/role system draws implicitly on the work of esteemed psychoanalyst Erik Erikson, who highlights (indirectly) two major disruptive aspects of the forced migration experience: destruction of a stable sense of future, degrading of cultural identity, and loss of healthy mirroring from loved ones: The young person, in order to experience wholeness, must feel a progressive continuity between that which he has come to be during the long years of childhood and that which he promises to become in the anticipated future; between that which he conceives himself to be and that which he perceives others to see in him and to expect of him. [...] Such identity, however, depends on the support which the young individual receives from the collective sense of identity characterizing the social groups significant to him: his class, his nation, his culture. [...] Where the resulting self-definition, for personal or for collective reasons, becomes too difficult, a sense of role confusion results....\"133 This role confusion crosses gender lines during complex emergencies. As Joop de Jong notes, \"men los[e] a major life purpose by losing their work, whether they were white-collar workers or peasants. Their sense of worth and identity [is] further hurt by their loss of ability to protect and care for their families.\" Meanwhile, \"[w]omen have to maintain their usual social role raising their children, doing household chores, or engaging in petty trade. But their burden is increased, since usual household tasks are more difficult,\" involving, for example, \"greater distances in carrying water and fuel, and more difficulties in drawing water. Additionally, [women] feel burdened 132 Ibid., 203-5. See also Derrick Silove, \"The Challenges Facing Mental Health Programs for Post-Conflict and Refugee Communities,\" Prehospital and Disaster Medicine 19, no. 1 (2004): 90-96. 133 Erik H. Erikson, Identity: Youth and Crisis (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1968), 87-89. 40 because of their idle husbands, and they often face an increasing risk of rape or physical abuse.\"134 In short, expectations and life scripts change without anyone's conscious knowledge of consent, and previously stable identities are launched into uneasy flux. Additionally, both Silove and Fullilove invoke the concept of attachment, which has become one of the most internationally influential Western psychodynamic theories since pioneer John Bowlby first noticed the traumatic stress that infants experienced when separated from their mothers. \"Intimate attachments to other human beings are the hub around which a person's life revolves,\" Bowlby writes, \"not only when he is an infant or a toddler or a schoolchild but throughout his adolescence and his years of maturity as well, and on into old age.\"135 Attachment patterns are not unique to the West, and are particularly evident in emergencies like displacement when interpersonal bonds are threatened or ruptured: Attachment behavior is any form of behavior that results in a person attaining or maintaining proximity to some clearly identified individual who is conceived as better able to cope with the world. It is most obvious whenever a person is frightened, fatigued or sick, and is assuaged by comforting and caregiving. Nevertheless for a person to know that an attachment figure is available and responsive gives him a strong and pervasive feeling of security and so encourages him to value and continue the relationship. [...] Since it is seen in virtually all human beings (though in varying patterns), it is regarded as integral part of human nature and one we share (to a varying extent) with members of other species.136 Accordingly, attachment patterns likely break down during forced migration because terror and flight neutralize power relationships. Because all IDPs share the same vulnerability, families lose clear hierarchies of authority, pillars of strength, and sharply defined roles. Suddenly no one, in Bowlby's words, \"is conceived as better able to cope with the world.\" Moreover, displacement 134 de Jong, \"Public Mental Health,\" 12-13. 135 John Bowlby, Loss: Sadness and Depression [Attachment and Loss Series, vol. III] (London: Basic Books, 1980), 442. 136 Bowlby, \"The Origins of Attachment Theory,\" in Bowlby, A Secure Base, Clinical Applications of Attachment Theory (London: Routledge, 1988), 27. 41 creates psychosocial crises for its victims in which attachment figures within the family unit and larger community become, to some degree, unavailable or unresponsive. Witness the following case example: [The family] had spent these months internally displaced[,] pushed from one village to another, with very little to eat. During this time the 14-year-old son, who had separated himself from the family believing he endangered them, had been killed along with another male relative. The family had returned to their home to find it completely burnt to the ground except for an outhouse. They had nothing left and were using an ammunition box as a table, and sleeping under a small piece of plastic in the garden, because the outhouse attracted snakes. As previously, the healthiest members of the family appeared to be the smallest boys, who denied any symptoms except some tearfulness now and then. They appeared active and cheerful except when witnessing their mother's distress. Mother was devastated, and could not stop crying. She could not sleep or eat or function and expressed suicidal ideas. [...] Two daughters had escaped the situation by marriage. [...] The other daughters remain trapped within the prison of their mother's unremitting grief. They all spent all day in the flat with their mother talking and crying [as] she did not wish to be left alone.137 Here, familial bonds of mutual support have been shattered by the forced migration experience. Children are parentified; parents are rendered incapable of nurturing. Family members escape, some never to be heard from again. Underlying these ruptured attachment bonds is the inability to appropriately mourn losses. As Lynne Jones, a child psychiatrist who has spent years working with refugee youth, writes, \"There may be uncertainty over missing relatives. The bod[ies of deceased loved ones] may have been treated inappropriately, the normal rituals impossible to carry out during flight. Massive losses that affect whole communities also have the effect of depriving each individual of the normal support that they would receive from their community if their loss were a single occurrence.\"138 137 Lynne Jones, \"Notes for Thinking About Attachment Grief and Loss in Societies Subject to Political Violence,\" in International Child Health Care, ed. D. Southall, B. Coulta, C. Ronald, and S. Parke (London: BMJ Books, 2002). 138 Ibid. 42 Jones makes perhaps the strongest and simplest argument for the value of psychosocial interventions. Because it is usually entire communities that are displaced, few are spared from suffering and thus few can provide compassionate consolation to their fellow migrants. The displaced family, Jones writes, \"not wishing to burden neighbors in a similar position to themselves, may become more reticent than usual about what is happening, and their own feelings. Because everyone is affected few are in the position to play the role of visitor, and comforter. Thus outsiders may have a significant role to play simply by encouraging and partaking as a visitor in the normal processes of mourning.\"139 By this token, the job of the mental health intervener is less about finding diagnoses and more about simply lending an ear. Availability of Mental Health Services in Sudan. Put simply, there are few qualified ears to go around in Sudan. Sudan has a gravely small number of trained mental health professionals: per ten thousand Sudanese, there are currently 0.09 psychiatrists, 0.17 psychologists, 0.2 psychiatric nurses, 0.1 social workers, and 0.2 psychiatric beds.140 (By comparison, the United States has, per ten thousand people: 13.7 psychiatrists, 31.1 psychologists, 6.5 psychiatric nurses, 35.3 social workers, and 7.7 psychiatric beds.) The only two psychotropic medications generally available at the primary health care level are phenobarbital and phenytoin sodium, both of which treat epilepsy only. There is no comprehensive mental health reporting system, no data collection system, and no epidemiological studies underway. To be sure, there are policies on the books, including a national mental health program and legislation devised in 1998 that \"aims to integrate 139 Ibid. 140 This is not to discount the valuable role that religious leaders have traditionally played in working to alleviate mental distress. Write Diaa E. El Gaili and colleagues, \"Until recently in the Sudan, interest in and concern about mental illness was mainly left to religious healers and such healers continue to see the majority of mental patients.\" See Diaa E. El Gaili, Mohi M. Magzoub, and Henk G. Schmidt, \"The Impact of a Community-oriented Medical School on Mental Health Services, Education for Health 15, no. 2 (2002): 150. 43 [mental health] with general health facilities along with [the] promotion of comprehensive mental health care, train mental health personnel[,] and establish a national organizational body for systematic coordination of related activities and the promotion of mental health,\" and there are some budget allocations for mental health (though WHO could not get access to concrete figures). Considering that practically no psychiatric services existed prior to World War II in Sudan, one cannot deny that there has been progress.141 But WHO sums up the sizeable constraints that have been hindering this national mental health initiative from having much of an impact: [A]n increasing number of well-qualified and experienced Sudanese psychiatrists and other mental health professionals have been leaving the country and this has created a serious problem for human resources; so far, there are no dedicated units for certain superspecialty areas, such as psychiatry of children; because of shortages of periodicals and good quality textbooks, students find difficulty in obtaining necessary mental health knowledge and relevant psychiatric references.142 Sudan's few mental health services are clustered in tiny, often foul wings of established hospitals in well-populated areas, far from the neediest populations.143 It is for all these reasons that international NGOs and the UN must do all they can to implement psychosocial interventions in these pockets of neglected suffering. 141 The 'Gezira Mental Health Law' of 1998 is a chapter of the Public Health Act of 1973 (revised in 1985), and is not easily available in English. 142 See World Health Organization, \"World Health Day 2001 Country Profile: Sudan,\" available at: http://www.emro.who.int/mnh/whd/CountryProfile-SUD.htm. 143 It is fitting here to give a very brief description of the history of psychiatry in Sudan. According to the World Health Organization, \"Psychiatry in Sudan began in the 1950s under the guidance of the late Professor Tigani El Mahi, the father of African psychiatry. He pioneered, among other things, rural services and the open door policy. His successor, Dr. Taha A. Baasher, shouldered the responsibility and further extended the services to the periphery. He established the Mental Health Association of Sudan and the Sudanese Association of Psychiatrists. By 1950, the Clinic for Nervous Disorders, Khartoum North, was well established, and the Kober Institution was built to cater for [sic] 120 forensic psychiatric patients. This was followed by the establishment of four psychiatric units in provincial capitals, at Wad Medani, Port Sudan, El Obeid and Atbara. In 1964, a 30-bed psychiatric ward was built in Khartoum General Hospital. Finally, in 1971, plans were laid to start work on Omdurman Psychiatric Hospital, the first of its kind in the history of Sudan. The underlying policy was first to establish psychiatric units with close links with medical institutions and broad connections with community agencies. Other mental health developments include[d] establishing a school for psychiatric medical assistants and organizing training courses for social workers and psychologists, for Sudan and other countries. See WHO, \"World Health Day 2001 Country Profile: Sudan.\" 44 This section has attempted to concretize the case for mental health interventions in Sudan. It contextualized the country's unprecedented crisis of forced migration, presented a more holistic spectrum of Western psychological thinking to move beyond PTSD's claustrophobic rubric and capture the visceral realities of displacement trauma, and finally it surveyed the anemic mental health resources currently at the disposal of the Sudanese. The final section will move from theory to practice, presenting numerous Sudanese conceptions of mental distress that any therapist, counselor, or empathic NGO worker would need to know in order to provide culturally-sensitive psychosocial assistance in Sudan. 45 III: Cultural Sensitivity in Mental Health Interventions for the Sudanese Displaced \"Every cultural group,\" write Marian Tankink and Annemiek Richters, \"creates its own cultural discourse which is built up from cultural assumptions, the tracks of its collective past, cultural notions of femininity, sexuality, gender identity and roles, discursive and symbolic formations and practices,...ideas of how to deal with order and chaos.\" This discourse is often dubbed the \"cultural master narrative.\"144 About seventy-five years ago, anthropologist Alfred Irving Hallowell wrote that the cross-cultural psychologist must cultivate an \"intimate knowledge of the culture [under his observation] as a whole\" - i.e., its master narrative - so as to become acutely \"aware of the normal range of individual behavior within the cultural pattern and likewise [to] understand what the people themselves consider to be extreme deviations from this norm. In short,\" Hallowell advised, \"he must develop a standard of normality with reference to the culture itself, as a means of controlling an uncritical application of the criteria he brings with him from our [Western] civilization.\"145 Hallowell's counsel is exceptionally relevant to any contemporary Western-trained therapist seeking, as part of a relief initiative, to provide effective psychosocial support to the Sudanese displaced. \"The nature of psychological distress experienced by internal displacement in central and southern Africa is likely to be different to that of persons affected by trauma who live in comparatively peaceful, economically prosperous, and stable countries,\" contend Ashraf Kagee and Arancha del Soto. \"Most likely distress is less individualistically constructed and may be more intimately tied with perceptions of family, community, and societal 144 Marian Tankink and Annemiek Richters, \"Silence as a Coping Strategy: The Case of Refugee Women in the Netherlands from South-Sudan who Experienced Sexual Violence in the Context of War,\" in Voices of Trauma, 198. They continue: \"Equally important are ideas of the values of personal responsibility, of how to control the environment, of how daily life should be arranged, and of an orientation toward the future.\" 145 Papers of Alfred Irving Hallowell, 1934, quoted in Anthony J. Marsella and Ann Marie Yamada, \"Culture and Mental Health: An Introduction and Overview of Foundations, Concepts, and Issues,\" in Handbook of Multicultural Mental Health, ed.

In the absence of information about the personal meanings, perceptions, beliefs, and cognitions that survivors may attribute to the experience, a focus only on overt symptoms elicited in the context of a diagnostic interview or checklist represents a unidimensional and decontextualized understanding of the experience.\"146 Field programs should be grounded in a Sudanese - not Western - 'standard of normality,' and this final section aims to illuminate some facets of Sudan's 'cultural master narrative' applicable to displacement trauma.147 Spirituality. Cultures differ pronouncedly in their conceptualizations and explanations of health and sickness. Over the last several decades, the field of \"cultural psychology\" has set out to \"study...the way cultural traditions and social practices regulate, express, transform, and permute the human psyche[;...and] the ways subject and object, self and other, psyche and culture, person and context, figure and ground, practitioner and practice live together, require each other, and dynamically, dialectically, and jointly make each other up,\" in Richard Shweder's words.148 In his sweeping 1980 work Theories of illness: A world survey, George Murdock distinguished between Western, naturalistic understandings of disease causation (\"infection, stress, organic deterioration, accidents, and acts of overt human aggression,\") and many non-Western, supernatural beliefs about illness, including: \"(a) theories of mystical causation because of impersonal forces such as fate, ominous sensations, contagion, mystical retribution, (b) theories of animistic causation because of personalized forces such as soul loss and spirit aggression, and (c) theories of magical causation or 146 Ashraf Kagee and Arancha Garcia Del Soto, \"Internal displacement and trauma: the need for a broader paradigm,\" Acta Geographica, Series A, No. 6, (2003) 229-243. 147 A discussion of programming particulars is beyond the scope of this paper. Appendix 5 includes excerpts from the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) guidelines on psychosocial programs, which provides a basic understanding of the forms interventions should take, the consensus of an esteemed panel of international experts including many of the clinicians and authors cited herein. 148 Richard A. Shweder, \"Cultural psychology\u2014what is it?\" in Cultural Psychology: Essays on comparative human development, ed. J. W. Stigler, R. A. Shweder, and G. Herdt (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 1. 47 actions of evil forces including sorcery and witchcraft.\"149 In Sudanese culture, the spiritual cannot be separated from either the physical or the psychological. Writes Lance Rasbridge: There is widespread belief in Sudanese culture, especially among southerners, in the spiritual realm and its manifestations on health and illness, although the beliefs vary greatly from one tribe to the next. The Nuer, for example, believe in a pantheon of Gods and spirits, both supernatural beings and spirits of animals, especially birds. During periods of epidemics or even individual health crises, oracles are sought out to identify the offended spirits and determine the proper recourse. Frequently an offering is presented or an animal is sacrificed in order to appease or drive away the evil spirit. A typical Dinka ceremony involves a spiritual elder praying over and then sacrificing a special white chicken in the presence of the afflicted. There is also a widespread belief in the concept of the \"evil eye,\" where a malevolent person possessing supernatural powers can cast a spell on someone just by gazing upon them.150 Sudanese tribes generally refer to mental health problems as \"misfortunes\" and believe their causes to be otherworldly: spirit possession, retribution for failure to perform rituals, curses levied by one family on another. \"For centuries, in the evenings, elders would sit around a fire and tell the children stories to teach the importance of following traditional rituals since not following certain cultural rituals and traditions is believed to provoke misfortune and as a result the consequence can be mental or physical illness, childlessness, accidents, social problems, or sudden death,\" Baron expounds.151 The following box lists some of the many supernatural beliefs about psychological suffering that intervention teams must expect to encounter:152 149 George Murdock, Theories of illness: A world survey (Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1980), as paraphrased by Marsella and Yamada, \"Culture and Mental Health,\" 17. 150 See Charles Kemp and Lance Rasbridge, Refugee and Immigrant Health: A Handbook for Health Professionals (Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 330-331. 151 Nancy Baron, \"Community Based Psychosocial and Mental Health Services for Southern Sudanese Refugees in Long Term Exile in Uganda,\" in Trauma, War, and Violence, 174. 152 Ibid., 173. 48 Boyden and Gibbs have demonstrated that at one Cambodian site, individual counseling of displaced persons was ineffectual because it did not take account of local beliefs about the role that ancestral spirits and other supernatural powers play in creating and resolving illness.153 Interventionists must not make the equivalent mistake with the Sudanese displaced. Traditional methods of treating \"misfortunes\" - consulting with traditional healers, working with herbs, sacrificing animals, beating drums and singing - may be far more effective at setting an IDP's mind at ease than hours of psychotherapy. Likewise, for those who find more meaning in more organized religion, prayer is an equally soothing coping strategy: 153 See J. Boyden and S. Gibbs, Children of War: responses to Psycho-social Distress in Cambodia (Geneva: The United Nations Research Institute for Social Development, 1997). See also Alcinda Honwana, \"The Collective Body: Challenging western concepts of trauma and healing,\" Track Two 8, no. 1 (July 1999), available at: http://www.ccr.uct.ac.za/archive/two/8_1/p30_collective_body.html. Honwana writes: \"In Mozambique and Angola there are local ways of understanding war trauma. In both countries people believe that war-related psychological trauma is directly linked with the anger of the spirits of those killed during the war. In southern Mozambique these spirits are called Mipfhukwa - spirits of those who did not have a proper burial to place them in their proper positions in the world of the ancestors. They are believed to be unsettled and bitter spirits who can cause harm to their killers or to passers-by.\" 49 \"Joan\" felt tortured by evil spirits. She reported that they burned her clothes and threw rocks at her children. She was awakened one night with her roof on fire. The Pastors told her that she must pray and strengthen her Christian faith in order to deter the spirits. Joan became Born Again and prayed over and over with the Pastors and church members. Eventually, the evil spirits disappeared.154 As Bessel Van der Kolk reminds, \"[r]eligion fulfills the critical function of providing a sense of purpose in the face of terrifying realities by placing suffering in a larger context and by affirming the commonality of suffering across generations, time and space.\"155 Social harmony and family. The notion of a fixed and individual \"self,\" which Westerners rarely question, is a foreign concept to billions of people around the world, including the Sudanese. \"The Western conception of the person as a bounded, unique, more or less integrated motivational and cognitive universe, a dynamic center of awareness, emotion, judgment, and action, organized into a distinctive whole and set contrastively\u2014both against other such wholes and against social and natural background\u2014is[,] however incorrigible it may seem to us, a rather peculiar idea within the context of the world's cultures,\" writes Clifford Geertz .156 Thus an outsider therapist's well-intentioned attempts to heal the IDP's individual \"self\" - as a solid and autonomous bundle of thoughts and emotions and wholly in the language of rational-empiricism - cannot be the bedrock of psychosocial interventions in Sudan. \"Focussing predominantly on the intrapsychic or the neurobiological dimensions of human experiences in psychiatry enables a more 154 Baron, \"Community Based Psychosocial and Mental Health Services,\" 174-5. The influence of the Church may be more powerful than that of traditional belief systems, of course. Writes Baron, \"[m]ost of the Sudanese [displaced] are Christians who practice their faith. [...] The churches preach in opposition to the traditional beliefs and preach that traditional healers are heathens and their traditional rituals useless. The churches teach that mental illnesses and other misfortunes are caused by evil spirits who harm people who do not have strong beliefs in the church. They teach people to believe strongly and pray so they will not have misfortune.\" 155 B. A. Van der Kolk, A. C. McFarlane, and L. Weisaeth, eds., Traumatic stress: The effects of overwhelming experience on mind, body and society (New York: Guildford, 1996). 156 Clifford Geertz, The interpretations of cultures: Selected essays (New York: Basic Books, 1973), 34. 50 manageable conceptualization of mental illness and health,\" writes Drozdek, \"although at the cost of fully understanding of their complexity. The interaction between the outside world and the individual should be analysed in order to understand human psychology more accurately.\"157 Indeed, mental health in Sudan is largely conceived in terms of social harmony; the Dinka, for example, use the terminology of \"cieng\" and \"adheeng\" to denote interpersonal accord and its accompanying feelings of wholeness: The Dinkas have a way of describing the balance between the aggressive and the compassionate, the egoistic and the social - in other words, the world in harmony. When things are in balance the world is in accordance with cieng. The accompanying feeling is adheeng. Cieng literally means home, a place and a situation where things are well-known, in unity and harmony, as opposed to places and situation where things are not so. It is a concept of ideal human relations.158 Understandably, an IDP camp is an environment deeply corrosive to the feeling of \"cieng,\" and clinicians must frame therapeutic discussions in these terms for this population to benefit. One cannot understand Sudanese health, either mental or physical, without making the family - defined expansively to include not just immediate relatives but also extended tribe and blood ties - the primary unit of analysis.159 \"The African definition of family,\" writes Kathrin Stoll, \"transcends Western notions of the nuclear family.\" The Sudanese conceive of family \"as consisting not only of blood kin, but also of members of their tribe or region,\" and families are \"bound together through blood kin, or \"mar\", and \"buth,\" i.e., a system of tribal membership that 157 Drozdek, \"The Rebirth of Contextual Stress in Context: A study of unaccompanied minors from Southern Sudan,\" in Forced Migration and Mental Health: Rethinking the Care of Refugees and Displaced Persons, ed. David Ingleby (New York: Springer, 2005), 69-70. They continue: \"It starts in the relations and good manners in the family but acquires, in the context of the wider society, the meaning of law. As circles widen it becomes blurred, aggressiveness being acceptable against peoples that are foreign to the Dinka. The pride and honour of a human being - related to cieng - is called dheng. Deng translates this in terms of nobility, beauty, elegance, charm, gracefulness, good manners, kindness, singing and dancing. Dheng in a way relates to individuality and cieng to sociability, but only seemingly so - there could not be dheng without cieng, which brings us back to the balance.\" 159 See Elizabeth Marie Coker, \"'Traveling Pains': Embodied Metaphors of Suffering Among Southern Sudanese Refugees in Cairo,\" Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry 28 (2004): 25. 51 cannot be directly traced back to a specific blood relative. It is not uncommon that two Sudanese will establish a buth bond by determining some relationship between tribal forefathers dating back hundreds of years. Being embedded within this larger social network of mar and buth,\" Stoll asserts, \"contributes to a strong sense of cohesion and mutual support within the community.\"160 The Dinka, who make up a substantial percentage of Sudanese IDPs, historically have cultivated deep tribal unity based on family ties as psychological protection from adversity: Beneath the tough exterior[,] Dinka culture provides emotional outlets that are valuable in dealing with difficult experiences in life. Poetry, empathy, close friendship and a sense of solidarity within the group all provide access to this emotional self and an ability to share and deal with the difficult experiences. The group behavior of the young Dinkas certainly forms a double-edged defense against both wild animals and attacking rival tribes. The mutual emotional support mechanisms within the group are a prerequisite to surviving and relating in a healthy way to the harsh realities in the plains of southern Sudan, as well as to the extremely tragic events the boys lived through during the civil war and their flight.161 The displaced almost invariably lose much of their familial and group support network during uprooting, which both generates and exacerbates psychological distress. One Sudanese refugee reports feeling utter hopelessness in the absence of her family, despite having access to quality medical treatment: There in the Sudan if you are sick, you will tell your mother this. Your brothers and sisters will come. You will see your relatives beside you and as a result you will be a bit better. When it comes to a situation where you don't have money, whether for medicines of for anything [i.e., food] you will find a number of people ready to help you. Your brother, your cousin, or your niece of any other relative of your father or mother will be there to help you. But when we compare with the situation in this country [Egypt], who is there to help you? Nobody. Even if you get a medicine to swallow in order to make you feel better, you cannot [feel better] because of nafsiyat [psychological problems]. You will find that your sickness cannot be treated because of the percentage of thoughts. 160 See Kathrin Stoll, \"Determinants of the Psychosocial Adjustment of Southern Sudanese Men,\" Journal of Refugee Studies 20, no. 4 (2007):621-640. See also J. D. Holtzman, Nuer Journeys, Nuer Lives: Sudanese Refugees in Minnesota 2000). 161 Jeppsson and Hjern, \"Traumatic Stress in Context,\" 78. 52 Now, if I was in the Sudan, when I am sick like this, \"Ah,\" my sister would come to see me. \"Oh? Who is that?\" My mother, she has come to see me. \"And who is that?\" A relative of mine. And so forth. There is a great difference here.162 This refugee's account no doubt resonates with Sudanese internally displaced as well, whose physical and emotional separation from loved ones during migration has been no less painful. Therapists therefore must counsel IDPs with acute awareness of their ruptured social networks, never framing evident suffering in simplistic \"What happened to you?\" terms.163 In fact, family and community responses to a member's mental distress can be decisive in the course that this member's suffering takes; support and nurturing facilitate healing and resolution, while stigmatization or neglect can contribute to development of full-scale pathology. Contrast, for example, two case studies of Sudanese displaced mothers who had lost a child during migration: \"Susan\" was sad and grieved for about a month. She had three other children. Her husband and family reassured her that the death was God's will and not her responsibility. Community members were compassionate. After a month she returned to her usual chores and though sad was functioning within her normal range. \"Jesca\" was sad and continually grieved. This was her only child. During the first month her crying never lessened and by the second month it intensified. Her husband, mother-in-law and community blamed her for her child's death. They said she was negligent and the husband threatened to leave her. She could not sleep, did not bathe or eat regularly, her head always hurt and she sat in her house day after day alone.164 \"Group cohesion plays a significant role in shaping the ways in which people might respond to their status as IDPs,\" writes one trauma researcher. \"Often, the presence or absence of group 162 Female focus group respondent as quoted in Coker, \"'Traveling Pains,'\" 26. Coker writes of the \"futility of medical treatment when the social and geographical basis of identity has been lost.\" 163 For an extended discussion on the cross-cultural clinical interview, See Cervando Martinez, \"Conducting the Cross-Cultural Clinical Interview,\" Multicultural Mental Health, 311-323. 164 Baron, \"Community Based Psychosocial and Mental Health Services,\" 166-67. 53 support may play an important role in creating conditions for ongoing survival and coping.\" Clinicians therefore can gauge the likelihood that an IDP's mental distress will worsen by looking at the web of relationships in which her suffering is embedded.165 Further, psychosocial interventions must focus wherever possible on reuniting family, tribe, and community as much as they do on one-on-one counseling. Writes Baron, [d]ue to exile many clans were split apart due to death and dislocation and the usual elder circles were often disconnected. The placement of refugees [and IDPs] into settlement sites by authorities was random, thereby, further splitting the clans and tribes. [...] In usual African communities, clan members care for their vulnerable without question. [... A] neighbor of a different clan or tribe is not going to easily change generations of tradition and assist in caring for an unknown neighbor's blind mother or retarded child especially not when the traditional beliefs are that the disability might be caused by angry spirits.166 IDPs isolated from family and clan predictably fare worse than those with such support networks intact. Olle Jeppsson and Anders Hjern recall encountering an improbably functional and healthy community of young Dinka displaced boys near the Ethiopian border, and attribute the boys' remarkable mental health - over 90% reported sophisticated coping strategies and highly optimistic expectations for the future including marriage, children, jobs - to the camp's \"culture-sensitive structure\" that preserved the social networks of peer groups that these boys had grown up with. \"Partly due to a lack of resources...and partly due to the wisdom of the aid personnel,\" the authors write, the Dinka boys' community \"structures and way of life were left alone. The boys were allowed to remain in their groups. Attempts to intervene, to break down the groups and place individual boys with foster families, were thwarted.\" Moreover, because the boys retained the power to build and organize their homes, schools, and activities, they \"remained the subjects of their lives and did not become objects, passively assisted\" by outsiders. Preciously few camps in 165 Kagee and Del Soto, \"Internal Displacement and Trauma,\" 237. 166 Baron, \"Community Based Psychosocial and Mental Health Services,\" 172. 54 Sudan resemble this democratic and socially-supportive ideal, but psychosocial intervention teams would do well to work towards restructuring camps wherever possible to emulate it.167 Indeed, psychosocial interventions can contribute positively toward renewing mutual support and nurturance within IDP families and communities traumatized by displacement. Nancy Baron, who has worked with Sudanese refugees in northern Uganda, reflects that collective worldviews and norms of support can change drastically in uprooting: Sudanese communities often shared experiences of violence and in reaction to these traumatic events not only did individuals suffer and change but people reported that the overall personality of the family and community changed. Some reported that as an overall group they were now less trusting and more fearful of each other and less motivated to help each other. Feelings of hopelessness and helplessness pervaded some families and communities. Some blamed their neighbors or other tribes and wanted revenge or to remain distant from them. Families and communities reported changes in culture, traditions, faith and spirituality due to their shared experiences. Some communities strengthened their belief in God and/or Spirits; others believed less. Some believed that they caused the traumatic events to occur due to their lack of adherence to traditional rituals or lack of faith, others felt it was God's will.168 Camp support groups, facilitated by intervention teams, may be one means of restoring shattered intergroup trust which in turn can promote individual coping and healing. Somatization and 'idioms of distress.' \"Social and cultural attitudes and struggles are played out in the terrain of the individual body,\" argues Elizabeth Marie Coker in her study of Sudanese refugees resettled in Cairo. \"The individual body and its sicknesses are not so much representations of the larger environment as a vital and inseparable part of it.\" Coker finds compelling evidence of \"the metaphorical role that body and illness play in the stories Sudanese refugees tell in order to articulate their sense of loss and disruption in the social and economic as 167 Jeppsson and Hjern, \"Traumatic Stress in Context,\" 77-78. 168 Baron, \"Community Based Psychosocial and Mental Health Services,\" 167. 55 well as physical and psychological domains.\"169 That is, lacking coherent narratives and scripts for their extraordinary trauma, the Sudanese displaced whom she studied expressed their suffering through \"idioms of distress\" that manifested as somatic complaints that were inextricably tied to their uprooting and migration.170 The \"reordering of culture and community after complete disruption,\" Coker concludes, \"must begin with the reordering of the body, a process that begins with a recognition of the disruption-as-illness.\"171 This finding comports with a body of literature from around the world on the phenomenon of \"somatization\" - defined by Kirmayer as \"the presence of physical symptoms for which there is no diagnosable physical pathology.\"172 Through somatization, \"the body serves as a medium for expressing social and emotional distress.\" Perhaps the most widely researched and scrutinized somatization disorder is a condition called nervios (literally, \"nerves\"), which is a Puerto Rican idiom of distress that befalls rural women predominantly and involves symptoms of stomach upset, heart palpitations, concentration difficulties, appetite and sleep disturbances, trembling, and compulsive worrying.173 \"Many individuals...will express their distress and...[i]t is to attempt to have the 169 Coker, \"'Traveling Pains,'\" 17. 170 On idioms of distress, see Daya J. Somasundaram and Willem A. C. M. van de Put, \"Management of Trauma in Special Populations,\" Journal of Clinical Psychiatry 67 (2006): 69. \"With regard to local idioms of distress, people of different cultures can be expected to express fear, psychological stress, and social problems in quite different ways. For example, in war-torn Cambodia and Sri Lanka, people presenting with psychological distress would often complain of headaches and breathing difficulty, respectively. This example demonstrates a need for health care workers to become educated in the expressions used by communities to communicate their distress. A person's cultural attachments may lead him or her to seek help from a traditional healer who, rather than recognizing psychological morbidity in terms of Western theories of causality, may instead view a person's problems in terms of his or her past conduct. This traditional help-seeking behavior and the resulting helping strategy need to be understood on a cultural basis and accommodated since more conventional methods of mental health intervention may not be viewed with the same acceptance.\" 171 Coker, \"'Traveling Pains,'\" 17. 172 Ronald J. Angel and Kristi Williams, \"Cultural Models of Health and Illness,\" in Multicultural Mental Health, 37; See also L. Grau and D. Padgett, \"Somatic depression among the elderly: A perspective,\" of Geriatric Psychiatry 3 (1988): 201-07; Leslie Swartz, Culture and mental health: A southern African view (Cape Town: Oxford University Press, 12-13; and Coker, \"'Traveling Pains,'\" 19. \"Of course,\" Coker notes, the displaced do indeed suffer from grave illnesses like malnutrition and tuberculosis, but \"there were many more [in her study] who complained of inexplicable pains and sicknesses that created frustration on the part of the medical staff and refugee clients alike.\" 173 Angel and Williams, \"Cultural Models of Health and Illness,\" 38. 56 patient elaborate on what they are experiencing, by asking them to say more about their distress without suggesting any specific symptom,\" advises one cross-cultural therapist.174 Working with Sudanese IDPs requires holistically considering the mind and body as making up two interwoven facets of the person, \"whose personal experiences are interpreted and influenced by the social context that defines the local moral order.\"175 Generally the Sudanese displaced will start a clinical interaction complaining of physical symptoms - chest pain, muscle aches, toothaches, burning sensations, problems with the 'nafs' (loosely meaning one's psyche) - but the \"pain inevitably [gives] way to narratives of social roles, identity, economics, etc.\" and suddenly \"a web of significance\" emerges that speaks to \"the realities of their traumatic and ongoing experiences\" as IDPs. Coker found that \"the way in which the stories were contextualized, symboliz[ed] movement, flight, and restlessness\" - that is, the trauma of their flight. \"Their pain was historicized,\" she observed, \"moving through the body and stopping at various locations, only to move on to another spot later on, sometimes years later.\" She fittingly terms the somatic trauma narratives \"traveling pains.\" A Bari woman, for example, recounts the route that her pain (i.e., the physical manifestation of her mental distress) has journeyed through her body: I don't know what my illness is. It is an illness that affected me some years ago. I don't remember what year it started but I think it began around five years ago. It started in my legs. I have a burning pain in my legs and after the burning pain, they become cold like cold water. My legs developed itching and I scratched them. But recently it has moved to affect my hands and heart too. I feel as if there is a fire burning in my hands and heart. The pain has now moved to my stomach as well.176 174 Martinez, \"Conducting the Cross-Cultural Interview,\" 316. 175 Angel and Williams, \"Cultural Models of Health and Illness,\" 35; H. Fabrega, Jr., Disease and social behavior: An interdisciplinary perspective (Cambridge, MA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1974); Arthur Kleinman, The illness narratives: Suffering, healing, and the human condition (New York: Basic Books, 1988). 176 Coker, \"'Traveling Pains,'\" 29. 57 Consider another Sudanese woman's account, which subtly links her physical symptoms to major traumatic life events: I'm suffering from rapid heart beat (darabat fil gelib). I also have a cough. [...] I think the illness started in Tonj [a town in southern Sudan] because after the death of my husband and two children I mourned for three years. I could not eat or drink well. It started by a mere cold and or flu and then a sore throat. It continued down my heart and up to date I'm suffering of it. We separated with my only child during the war in Tonj. I ran to Khartoum and he remained in Tonj. I think too much about my family and my fate[,...] about the loss of my family and about my only son with whom we got separated during the war.177 Another woman invokes the common Sudanese idiom of distress, \"thinking too much,\" to express grief over her lost identity: I sometimes suffer from headache to the extent that I cannot raise my eyes like this [raises eyes to ceiling]. My eyes seem as if they want to drop down. But the only thing is that I know that it is only nafsiyat [psychological problems] due to too much thinking. The proof is that if you sometimes sit like this, something will just cross in your eyes and then you will begin to think of the way that you were leading your life before...178 \"When the self is broken apart,\" concludes Coker, \"it hurts, and pain is the ultimate embodied metaphor. It is everywhere, and nowhere at the same time.\"179 The Sudanese invoke two metaphors in particular to express their psychological 'misfortunes': united hearts and human blood. \"The 'blood' [is] the metaphor used to express the idea of 'humanness,'\" and more deeply, of \"existential loss\": Blood (or the recognition of one as having blood) was the recognition of one as a fellow person. 'We the southern Sudanese' said one man, 'God gave us good blood and the foods we eat.' However, their blood was not recognized by those who would not recognize them as humans. [...] Not recognizing one as human means not acknowledging one's human 'blood,' 177 Quoted in Coker, \"'Traveling Pains,'\" 21-23. Coker \"thinking too much\" was a very common exacerbating factor in illness, even if it was not seen to have directly caused the illness. Typically, refugees stated that they 'thought too much' about their very hard conditions in exile, or their past security problems in Sudan, which 'fueled' their illnesses in one way or another.\" 178 Ibid., 24. 179 Ibid. 58 which is akin to being nonhuman, or an animal. Said one man, 'Here, you are overworked like a donkey, as if your body has no blood.180 An IDP loses whatever livelihood and autonomy he enjoyed in his previous life, and therefore has lost a major part of his humanness, or 'blood.' Camps strip away humanity. Clinicians must recognize complaints about 'blood sickness' as likely metaphors for much deeper distress over the objectification, marginalization, and dehumanization inherent in the migration experience.181 Similarly, Coker's study found \"heart pain\" to be the presenting symptom for a deeper sense of culture loss. \"For the clinic respondents, the heart was often an 'end place' in the traveling of the illness through the body. [...] The heart is the locus of social and emotional pain, wounds, and sickness for the southern Sudanese. When people discussed loneliness, fear, or the poor treatment they received..., the heart was where this was felt, first and foremost.\"182 The heart tends to be, idiomatically, the resting place of pain rather than its source. Interethnic tensions among the displaced create \"bad\" or \"unclean\" hearts. \"In other words,\" writes Coker, \"the heart [is] clearly the place where unity of community and identity were located. Tensions, breakages, fragmentation in unity between group members or families literally dirtied the heart and made it 'unclean.' On the other hand, 'strength,' stability, and devotion to the family were located in the heart.\"183 The heart idiom, with its connections to culture loss, raises the following important distinction for outsider interventions to bear in mind. Cultural bereavement versus traumatic grief. Most Western clinicians, when confronted with a patient who presents symptoms of fatigue, diminished interest in activities, feelings of sadness and 180 Ibid., 29-30. 181 Ibid. 182 Ibid., 28. 183 Ibid. 59 emptiness, and impaired concentration, likely suspect major depressive disorder, DSM diagnostic category 296.2.184 Notwithstanding the significant number of displaced persons who do experience such clinical depression, the above symptoms may not stem from depression in this fixed, psychopathological sense as much as they do from what Australian anthropologist and psychiatrist Maurice Eisenbruch terms \"cultural bereavement\": Cultural bereavement is the experience of the uprooted person - or group - resulting from loss of social structures, cultural values and self-identity: the person - or group - continues to live in the past, is visited by supernatural forces from the past while asleep or awake, suffers feelings of guilt over abandoning culture or homeland, feels pain if memories of the past begin to fade, but finds constant images of the past (including traumatic images) intruding into daily life, yearns to complete obligations to the dead and feels stricken by anxieties, morbid thoughts and anger that mar the ability to get on with daily life.185 Cultural bereavement, writes Eisenbruch, is \"not in itself a disease\" but rather \"an understandable response to catastrophic loss of social structure and culture. 186 Culturally-sensitive clinicians must learn to distinguish between the predictable mental anguish of losing one's culture and the psychopathological response to trauma, reactions that are subtly but concretely different. Jones outlines some of the distinguishing hallmarks: Loss Traumatic Event Image and memory of the lost person very important Intrusive memories of means of death, no memory of lost person Yearning and preoccupation with loss Anxious and preoccupied with traumatic event Separation anxiety changes to deep sadness Anxiety about security can persist Anger at loss Irritable, diffuse, unfocussed anger and rage Guilt at not doing enough Guilt at surviving Seek out reminders of loved one Hypervigilant, scanning environment for threat Mourning as a tribute to dead Avoidance of thinking of event and reminders Dream of dead person is comforting Nightmares of event are terrifying. Table: Distinguishing Between the Effects of Loss and Experiencing a Traumatic Event187 184 DSM, 356. 185 Maurice Eisenbruch, \"From Post Traumatic Stress Disorder to Cultural Bereavement: Diagnosis of South East Asia Refugees,\" Social Science and Medicine 33 (1988): 673-680. 186 Ibid. 187 Excerpted from Lynne Jones, \"Thinking About Attachment Grief and Loss.\" 60 Two final points bear mentioning despite (or because of) their simplicity. First, Western cultures more than others value openly expressing emotions. Striving for catharsis - a staple of psychotherapy in the US and Europe - should not necessarily be the aim of interventions in Africa. \"[S]tudies on healing war trauma in Mozambique,\" for example, \"have shown that recalling the traumatic experience through verbal externalization as a means to healing is not always effective. In many instances people would rather not talk about the past or look back, and prefer to start afresh once certain ritual procedures, which do not necessarily involve verbal expression of the affliction, have been performed.\"188 Individual healing in Sudanese culture most often occurs in collective ritual and social reconciliation rather than secluded, private therapy: These healing and protective rituals do not involve verbal exteriorisation of the experience. Healing is achieved through non-verbal symbolic procedures, understood by participants. That is why clothes and other objects symbolizing the past had to be burnt or washed away to impress on the individual and the group a complete rupture with that experience and the beginning of a new life. Recounting and remembering the traumatic experience would be like opening a door for the harmful spirits to penetrate the communities.189 Thus, psychotherapists who attempt to transplant the 'talking cure' model on culturally-diverse populations, however well-intentioned the impulse, \"may in fact cause more harm than help.\"190 Second, the gold standard for mental health in Sudanese IDPs - indeed, in all populations - should be functionality.191 How functional is an individual in the context of her individual life, family roles, and community involvement? Symptoms of psychological distress in a first world setting may be supremely functional - indeed, impressively adaptive - in areas of serious poverty and conflict. For instance, a Sudanese internally displaced child who doubts he will be alive 188 Honwana, \"The Collective Body.\" 189 See \"Non-Western Concepts 190 Kagee and Del Soto, \"Internal and trauma: the need for a broader paradigm,\" 236. 61 fifteen years from now might be diagnosed in the West as having major depressive disorder, though given the realities of lifespan and violence in Sudan, \"this should rather be interpreted as a rational estimate of the possibilities of long-term survival in this region\" and a sign of psychological resilience in the face of unpalatable truth. Likewise, an IDP from a nomadic tribe who exhibits edgy hypervigilance shows a classic symptom of PTSD (see Appendix 3), but a culturally-sensitive clinician understands that most Sudanese nomads have spent their entire lives, to maintain their livelihoods, safeguarding precious cows from the attacks of wild animals and aggressive neighbors. Thus such adaptive hypervigilance is arguably a highly rewarded coping mechanism. 192 As Kagee and del Soto elaborate: Some symptoms...serve adaptive functions and help the person survive. For example, in situations characterized by severe threat and danger such as the interrogation context, symptoms such as hyperarousal, hypervigilance, enhanced auditory acuity, and restlessness are adaptive rather than pathological. Hence, such behavior may be more appropriately considered a characteristic sequel to the experience of internal displacement rather than a set of symptoms. Certain phenomena such as dreams and nightmares have often been thought of as symptoms of psychiatric disturbance...[y]et, these experiences may have alternate meanings and significance among non-Western respondents....193 Context, here as always, is key. 192 Jeppsson and Hjern, \"Traumatic Stress in Context,\" 77. 193 Kagee and Del Soto, \"Internal displacement and trauma: the need for a broader paradigm,\" 237. 62 *** This paper began by introducing a rapidly spreading global awareness that violence and displacement profoundly influences physical and mental health, and that the somatic and psychological are inexorably entwined. It reviewed the major milestones in twentieth century trauma science that cumulatively birthed today's widely endorsed - yet controversial - ethical imperative to intervene psychosocially in complex emergencies where distressed populations lack mental health care. It provided a holistic understanding of displacement trauma that transcends rigid debates over PTSD's universal relevance, and made a case for interventions in the Sudanese internally displaced, who today suffer silently with practically no psychosocial support. Finally, it examined some concrete ways that interventionists can infuse their work in Sudan with cultural sensitivity. There is a dire need for more empirical, field-based research into Sudanese conceptions of mental health. Given the scope of Sudan's displacement crisis, there is astonishingly little cross-cultural psychiatric and psychological research available in English (or recent scholarship in Arabic, for that matter) on Sudanese manifestations and understandings of psychological distress, per se.194 Within the leading edited volumes on cross-cultural trauma in displaced and war-affected populations, released over the last fifteen years, there is a mere handful of case studies that examine Sudan in any moderate depth. (Cambodia and China, in contrast, have received a flood of attention).195 Until a more robust research agenda is in place, psychosocial interventionists would do well to heed Wilson's and Drozdek's \"Ten Hypotheses Concerning Trauma, Culture and Posttraumatic Mental Health Interventions\" when in doubt: 194 For a bibliography on older research, see http://www.sudan-health.net/bibliography/biblio.htm 195 See for example, Marsella, et. al, Amidst Peril and Pain; Ingleby, ed., Forced Migration and Mental Health, Drozdek and Wilson, Voices of Trauma; Wilson and Drozdek, Broken Spirits. 63 1. ...While the impact of trauma seems to be universal on a biological level, both attribution and conceptualization of traumatic experiences are culture-bound. 2. Healing and recovery from psychic trauma is person-specific. There are multiple pathways and forms of treatment within a culture. [...] 3. Each culture develops specific forms and mechanisms for posttraumatic recovery, stabilization and healing (e.g., rituals, counseling practices, treatment protocols, medications, etc.) [...] 4. ...[C]ultures contain the wisdom to develop mechanisms to facilitate the processing and integration of psychic trauma. Empathy, as a universal psychobiological capacity, underlies the development and evolution of culture-specific forms of healing. 5. The concept of \"mindfulness\" in states of consciousness (traditionally associated with Buddhism) is a key mental process to...personal awareness of the impact of trauma to living in one's culture of origin and how trauma has impacted the quality of life. 6. There is no individual experience of psychological trauma without a cultural history, grounding or background. Similarly, there is no individual sense of personal identity without a cultural reference point. [...] 7. The rapid growth of globalization and mass migrations in the twenty first [c]entury are creating new evolutions in a \"world-universal\" culture and the possibility of fusing cross-cultural modalities of treatment and recovery. 8. Healing rituals are an integral part of highly cohesive cultures. Healing rituals evolve in situations of crisis, emergency and threat to the social structure of society and culture. Healing rituals demand special roles and skills (e.g., shaman, crisis counselor, psychologist, medicine person, priest, etc.) to facilitate efforts for recovery and the psychic metabolism of trauma. 9. Western posttraumatic therapies and traditional healing practices, in culturally-specific forms, can facilitate resilience, personal growth and self-transcendence in the wake of trauma. 10. The pathways to healing are idiosyncratic and universal in nature across cultures. The pathways of healing vary in form, purpose, duration, social complexity and utilization by a culture.196 The wisdom of Wilson's ten hypotheses rests in his framing of Western psychology - with its bedrock of one-on-one psychotherapy - as just another culturally-specific \"healing ritual,\" no more 'expert' or superior than consulting a shaman or praying to ancestors. It is the duty of a culturally-sensitive mental health practitioner to shun ethnocentrism and instead ask questions like: \"How 196 John P. Wilson and Boris Drozdek, \"Are We Lost in Translations?: Unanswered Questions on Trauma, Culture and Posttraumatic Syndromes and Recommendations for Future Research,\" in Voices of Trauma, 381-82. 64 [does Sudanese culture] interact with biological, psychological, and environmental variables to influence [or indeed protect against] psychopathology\" in this individual? What are Sudanese \"standards of normality and abnormality\" embedded in this individual's family, clan, tribe, community?197 In general, \"What works for whom and under what conditions?\"198 \"Beyond doubt,\" Wilson and Drozdek contend, where \"nineteenth of counseling and psychotherapy [were] culture-bound[,...t]he twenty-first [c]entury will witness the development and emergence of global conceptualizations of what constitutes trauma and how it gets healed.\"199 Indeed, international psychologists and humanitarian workers have begun to form virtual 'communities of practice' in which they share culturally-specific best practices in understanding and healing trauma - instantaneously, over online web portals.200 It is this author's hope that the present paper will make one small contribution to this expanding global dialogue, opening up new awareness of the mental health implications of Sudan's unprecedented catastrophe of forced migration, and spurring both a deeper appreciation of the need for psychosocial interventions in this particular complex emergency and an urgent commitment to investigating further Sudanese conceptions of mental health. The Sudanese live in the very center of Becker's \"nightmare spectacular,\" and if psychosocial interventions can make their mental suffering even a little less nightmarish, they are a supremely worthy humanitarian endeavor. ! 197 Marsella and Yamada, \"Culture and Mental Health,\" 11-12. we lost in Translations?\" 384. 199 Ibid. 200 See, for example, the Harvard Program on Refugee Trauma's Certificate Program in Global Mental Health, available at: http://www.hprt-cambridge.org/Layer2.asp?page_id=9. 65 Appendix 1: Map of Sudan201 201 Map no. 3707 Rev. 10, United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations, Cartographic Section, April 2007. 66 Appendix 2: Internally Displaced Persons in Sudan (tabulated November 2007)202 5.8 million estimated IDPs in Sudan (November 2007) The civil war in Sudan has generated the largest internally displaced population in the world during the past two decades. Most IDPs do not live in camps which makes it harder to monitor numbers. Despite the scale of the problem, no systematic mechanisms to monitor population movements have been set up in the country and most figures are estimates and projections. As of November 2007, there was no official consensus on the overall number of IDPs in Sudan. The OCHA Regional Office for Central and East Africa, in its Displaced Populations Report, January - June 2007, uses an estimate of 4,465,000 IDPs for all of Sudan. According to the 2007 Workplan for Sudan, there are 2,071,000 IDPs in Khartoum. But a survey conducted by IOM in 2005 found that at least 36% of Khartoum's IDPs do not intend to return to their home areas and are likely to remain in Khartoum. Thus the Workplan states that Khartoum is \"now hosting an estimated 1 million permanent residents who were previously regarded as temporary.\"203 According to OCHA, 1,323,535 returned IDPs were recorded by mid-2007 (Regional Office for Central and East Africa, Displaced Populations Report, January - June 2007, p.1 and footnote 3). It should be noted that IDPs retain special vulnerabilities upon return until they have successfully reintegrated in social and economic terms into their old communities, or into the communities where they have chosen to resettle. 202 Excerpted in full from Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, available at: http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/CA38A0F0F269546F802570B8005AAFAD?OpenDocument. 203 See United Nations, Workplan for Sudan (2007), available at: http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/24F8F435855D75B4C125736F00468499/$file/Work+Plan+2007.pdf 67 Appendix 3: DSM Anxiety Disorder 309.81: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder204 Diagnostic Features The essential features of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder is the development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor involving direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one's physical integrity; or witnessing an event that involves death, injury, or a threat to another person; or learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death or injury experienced by a family member or other close associate (Criterion A1). The person's response to the event must involve intense fear, helplessness, or horror (or in children, the response must involve disorganized or agitated behavior) (Criterion A2). The characteristic symptoms resulting from the exposure to the extreme trauma include persistent reexperiencing of the traumatic event (Criterion B), persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma and numbing of general responsiveness (Criterion C), and persistent symptoms of increased arousal (Criterion D). The full symptom picture must be present for more than 1 month (Criterion E), and the disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. (Criterion F). Traumatic events that are experienced directly include, but are not limited to, military combat, violent personal assault (sexual assault, physical attack, robbery, mugging), being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration as a prisoner of war or in a concentration camp, natural or manmade disasters, severe automobile accidents, or being diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. For children, sexually traumatic events may include developmentally inappropriate sexual experiences without threatened violence or assault. Witnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing the serious injury or unnatural death of another person due to violent assault, accident, war, or disaster or unexpectedly witnessing a dead body or body parts. Events experienced by others that are learned about include, but are not limited to violent personal assault, serious accident, or serious injury experienced by a family member or a close friend; learning about the sudden unexpected death of a family member or a close friend; or learning that one's child has a life-threatening disease. The disorder may be especially severe or long lasting when the stressor is of human design (e.g. tortune, rape). The likelihood of developing the disorder may increase as the intensity of and physical proximity to the stressor increase. The traumatic events can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly the person has recurrent and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion B1) or recurrent distressing dreams during which the event is replayed. (Criterion B2). In rare instances, the person experiences dissociative states that last from a few seconds to several hours, or even days, during which components of the event are relived and the person behaves as though experiencing the event at the moment (Criterion B3). Intense psychological distress (Criterion B4) or physiological reactivity (Criterion B5) often occurs when the person is exposed to triggering events that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event (e.g., anniversaries of the traumatic event; cold, snowy weather or 204 See American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Association, 2000), 463-68. 68 uniformed guards for survivors of death camps in cold climates; hot, humid weather for combat veterans of the South Pacific; entering any elevator for a woman who was raped in an elevator). Stimuli associated with the trauma are persistently avoided. The person commonly makes deliberate efforts to avoid thoughts, feelings, or conversations about the traumatic event (Criterion C1) and to avoid activities, situations, or people who arouse recollections of it (Criterion C2). This avoidance of reminders may include amnesia for an important aspect of the traumatic event (Criterion C3). Diminished responsiveness to the external world, referred to as \"psychic numbing\" or \"emotional anesthesia\" usually begins soon after the traumatic event. The individual may complain of having markedly diminished interest in previously enjoyed activities (Criterion C4), of feeling detached or estranged from other people (Criterion C5), or of having a markedly reduced ability to feel emotions (especially those associated with intimacy, tenderness, and sexuality) (Criterion C6). The individual may have a sense of a foreshortened future (e.g., not expecting to have a career, marriage, children, or a normal life span) (Criterion C7). The individual has persistent symptoms of anxiety or increased arousal that were not present before the trauma. These symptoms may include difficulty falling or staying asleep that may be due to recurrent nightmares during which the traumatic event is relived (Criterion D1), hypervigilance (Criterion D4), and exaggerated startle response or difficulty concentrating or completing tasks (Criterion D3). Specifiers The following may be used to specify onset and duration of the symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Acute. This specifier should be used when the duration of the symptoms is less than 3 months. Chronic. This specifier should be used when the symptoms last three months or longer. With Delayed Onset. This specifier indicates that at least 6 months have passed between the traumatic event and the onset of symptoms. Associated Features and Disorders Associated descriptive features and mental disorders. Individuals with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder may describe painful guilt feelings about surviving when others did not survive or about the things they had to do to survive. Phobic avoidance of situations or activities that resemble or symbolize the original trauma may interfere with interpersonal relationships and lead to marital conflict, divorce, or loss of job. The following associated constellation of symptoms may occur and are more commonly seen in association with an interpersonal stressor (e.g., childhood sexual or 69 physical abuse), domestic battering, being taken hostage, incarceration as a prisoner of war or in a concentration camp, torture): impaired affect modulation; self-destructive and impulsive behavior; dissociative complaints; ineffectiveness, shame, despair, or hopelessness; feeling permanently damaged; a loss of previously sustained beliefs; hostility; social withdrawal; feeling constantly threatened; impaired relationships with others; or a change from the individual's previous personality characteristics. There may be increased risk of Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Social Phobia, Specific Phobia, Major Depressive Disorder, Somatization Disorder, and Substance-Related Disorders. It is not known to what extent these disorders precede or follow the onset of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Associated laboratory findings. Increased arousal may be measured through studies of autonomic functioning (e.g., heart rate, electromyography, sweat gland activity). Associated physical examination findings and general medical conditions. General medical conditions may occur as a consequence of the trauma (e.g. head injury, burns). Specific Culture and Age Features Individuals who have recently emigrated for areas of considerable social unrest and civil conflict may have elevated rates of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Such individuals may be especially reluctant to divulge experiences of torture and trauma due to their vulnerable political status. Specific assessments of traumatic experiences are needed for such individuals. In younger children, distressing dreams of the event may, within several weeks, change into generalized nightmares of monsters, of rescuing others, or of threats to self or others. Young children usually do not have the sense that they are reliving the past; rather, the reliving of the trauma may occur through repetitive play (e.g.), a child who was involved in a serious automobile accident repeatedly reenacts car crashes with toy cars). Because it may be difficult for children to report diminished interest in significant activities and constriction of affect, these symptoms should be carefully evaluated with reports from parents, teachers, and other observers. In children, the sense of a foreshortened future may be evidenced by the belief that life will be too short to include becoming an adult. There may be \"omen formation\"-that is, belief in an ability to foresee future untoward events. Children may also exhibit various physical symptoms, such as stomachaches and headaches. Prevalence Community-based studies reveal a lifetime prevalence for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ranging from 1% to 14%, with the variability related to methods of ascertainment and the population 70 sampled. Studies of at-risk individuals (e.g., combat veterans, victims of volcanic eruptions or criminal violence) have yielded prevalence rates ranging from 3% to 58%. Course Posttraumatic Stress Disorder can occur at any age, including childhood. Symptoms usually begin within the first three months after the trauma, although there may be a delay of months, or even years, before symptoms appear. Frequently the disturbance initially meets criteria for Acute Stress Disorder (see p. 429) in the immediate aftermath of the trauma. The symptoms of the disorder and the relative predominance of reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms may vary over time. Duration of the symptoms varies, with complete recovery occurring within three months in approximately half of cases, with many others having persisting symptoms for longer than 12 months after the trauma. The severity, duration, and proximity of an individual's exposure to the traumatic event are the most important factors affecting the likelihood of developing this disorder. There is some evidence that social supports, family history, childhood experiences, personality variables, and preexisting mental disorders may influence the development of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. This disorder can develop in individuals without any predisposing conditions, particularly if the stressor is especially extreme. Differential Diagnosis In Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, the stressor must be of extreme (i.e., life-threatening) nature. In contrast, in Adjustment Disorder, the stressor can be of any severity. The diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder is appropriate both for situations in which the stressor does not meet the criteria for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (or another specific mental disorder) and for situations in which the symptom pattern of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder occurs in response to a stressor that is not extreme (e.g., spouse leaving, being fired). Not all psychopathology that occurs in individuals exposed to an extreme stressor should necessarily be attributed to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Symptoms of avoidance, numbing, and increased arousal that are present before exposure to the stressor do not meet criteria for the diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and require consideration of other diagnoses (e.g., a Mood Disorder or another Anxiety Disorder). Moreover, if the symptom response to pattern to the extreme stressor meets criteria for another mental disorder (e.g., Brief Psychotic Disorder, Conversion Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder), these diagnoses should be given instead of, or in addition to, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. Acute Stress Disorder is distinguished from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder because the symptom pattern in Acute Stress Disorder must occur within 4 weeks of the traumatic event and resolve within that 4-week period. If the symptoms persist for more than 1-months and meet criteria for 71 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, the diagnosis is changed from Acute Stress Disorder to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. In Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, there are recurrent intrusive thoughts, but these are experienced as inappropriate and are not related to an experienced traumatic event. Flashbacks in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder must be distinguished from illusions, hallucinations, and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in Schizophrenia, other Psychotic Disorders, Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features, a delirium, Substance-Induced Disorders, and Psychotic Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition. Malingering should be ruled out in those situations in which financial remuneration, benefit eligibility, and forensic determinations play a role. Diagnostic criteria for 309.81 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder A. The person has been exposed to a traumatic event in which both of the following were present: (1) the person experienced witnessed, or was confronted with an event or events that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of others (2) the person's response involved intense fear, helplessness, or horror. (Note: In children, this may be expressed instead by disorganized or agitated behavior.) B. The traumatic event is persistently reexperienced in one (or more) of the following ways: (1) recurrent and distressing recollections of the event, including images, thoughts, or perceptions. Note: In young children, repetitive play may occur in which themes or aspects of the trauma are expressed. (2) recurrent distressing dreams of the event. (note: in children, there may be frightening dreams without recognizable content.) (3) acting or feeling if the traumatic event were recurring (includes a sense of reliving the experience, illusions, hallucinations, and dissociative flashback episodes, including those that occur on awakening or when intoxicated). (note: In young children, trauma-specific reenactment may occur.)

The most recent legislation is the state law 'Gezira Mental Health Law' of 1998. The mental health legislation forms a chapter of the Public Health Act of 1973, which was revised in 1985. The Mental Health Act has been drafted and has gone to the parliament for approval. The latest legislation was enacted in 1998. 205 From World Health Organization, Mental Health Atlas (Geneva: World Health Organization, 2005), 441-2. 74 Mental Health Financing. There are budget allocations for mental health. Details about expenditure on mental health are not available. The primary source of mental health financing is tax based. The country has disability benefits for persons with mental disorders. Mental Health Facilities. Mental health is not a part of primary health care system. Actual treatment of severe mental disorders is not available at the primary level. Mental health has not been integrated with the primary care, and there is also a lack of personnel. Regular training of primary care professionals is carried out in the field of mental health. In the last two years, about 40 personnel were provided training. Training facilities are present for primary care physicians, police and prison officers. The Gezira Mental Health Programme was aimed at modifying community concepts, attitudes and practices concerning mental health, ensuring community involvement and participation and extending mental health services by training primary health care staff. The evaluation of the programme showed that it helped in raising public awareness and community participation. Members of the health team and teachers who received training reported a better understanding of mental health problems and an improvement in their handling of the mental problems. Sudan has the experience of using traditional healers for provision of mental health services. There are no community care facilities for patients with mental disorders. Community care is absent due to the lack of proper transportation, lack of social workers and poor health education. Psychiatric Beds and Professionals Total psychiatric beds per 10 000 population 0.2 Psychiatric beds in mental hospitals per 10 000 population 0.18 Psychiatric beds in general hospitals per 10 000 population 0.02 Psychiatric beds in other settings per 10 000 population 0 Number of psychiatrists per 100 000 population 0.09 Number of neurosurgeons per 100 000 population 0.007 Number of psychiatric nurses per 100 000 population 0.2 Number of neurologists per 100 000 population 0.014 Number of psychologists per 100 000 population 0.17 Number of social workers per 100 000 population 0.1 Many mental health professionals including most psychiatrists have left for other countries. Non-Governmental Organizations. NGOs are not involved with mental health in the country. Special attention has been given to migrants, elderly, refugees, displaced and homeless and children. Information Gathering System. There is no mental health reporting system in the country. Some mental health information particularly numbers related to admissions for major disorders are collected from a few hospitals in the general health data collection system, but the system has many 75 limitations. The country has no data collection system or epidemiological study on mental health. There are no funds or personnel to carry out epidemiological studies. Programmes for Special Population. These groups are supported by NGOs and UNICEF. A school mental health programme is present. Therapeutic Drugs. The following therapeutic drugs are generally available at the primary health care level of the country: phenobarbital, phenytoin sodium. Since mental health is not integrated in primary care level, most of the drugs are not available at primary care level. A list of essential neuropsychiatric drugs for all levels has been formulated. 76 Appendix 5: Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Guidelines on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings - Excerpt206 206 IASC Guidelines, 38-45. 77 78 79 80 Bibliography Books Agger, I., and J.
