His strong understanding of how the body works was developed in his years as a massage therapist which was deepened after studying Chinese Medicine. It was during his studies that Brendan found his interest for treating pain, both chronic and acute. Using Chinese medicine principles he uses local and distal acupuncture points, herbal medicine and massage techniques to restore strength and movement but to also improve sleep and digestion so the body can better repair and restore itself. Brendan has worked alongside practitioners from other modalities including physiotherapists and chiropractors, complementing his knowledge. Besides Gavin is passionate about helping others out of pain and to live happier and healthier lives. With his experience as a remedial massage therapist, he has a particular appreciation for how pain and dysfunction can negatively affect someone's life. Through his studies of Chinese medicine, Chinese philosophy and Taiji martial arts he understands that for lasting relief, the person must be treated as a whole and not just a series of complaints. This means that not only should pain be treated well, but also any [sleep](/conditions/insomnia), emotional, [ digestive](/conditions/digestive-issues), gynaecological, and other health issues should also be addressed to help improve the quality of life. Madeleine Ong Maddie has a strong appreciation for both Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine. After completing her Bachelor of Health Science this appreciation inspired her to complete a six-week program at the China-Japan Friendship Hospital in Beijing in 2014. It was here she observed the integration of the two medical approaches in various fields including gynecology, diabetes, oncology, dermatology and many more. This integration of ideas alongside the desire to optimize the wellbeing of patients further motivated Maddie to undertake postgraduate study in Science Research. Her thesis focused on examining the pharmacological mechanisms of herbal medicine for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome which is currently under examination. Cameron Lockey Cameron approaches each client at Village Remedies with care and compassion. From initial consultation, through to treatment with acupuncture and herbal medicine, he has brought relief to clients suffering from insomnia and digestive issues, brought balance to energy levels and emotional stress, and stimulated labour induction. He has a special interest in martial arts and sports which he applies to the treatment and recovery of musculoskeletal injuries and pain management, working with you to achieve your performance goals. He has learnt through University and practical experience in Beijing, that treatment needs to address not only someone's main symptom, but their overall health and wellbeing and that is what he strives to do for all his clients. Bonte Lam Chinese medicine has the ability to help people even when Western medicine may not have a clear diagnosis. It does that by recognising patterns in the body and coming up with solutions that have been perfected over 5000 years. Bonte has found it fascinating how Chinese medicine reads these patterns in the body and comes up with practical solutions to improve people's lives. Her journey in Chinese Herbal Medicine and Acupuncture started from when her parents used herbal medicine to help her overcome common childhood illnesses. This sparked her passion and interest and in later years, found it extremely helpful with menstruation issues, musculoskeletal and digestion issues. Bonte got her degree at UTS in B Health Science in Traditional Chinese Medicine and honed her skills in helping people with musculoskeletal, sleep, digestion and mood. Bonte has also worked as a beauty therapist which gives her a unique perspective on how Chinese Medicine can help with skin conditions. "}
