It works where other weight loss programs fail. Using a structured eating plan, a patient enters \"dietary ketosis\". This is a metabolic state where body fat is burned for energy, instead of dietary carbohydrates. This can naturally occur even when not following a diet, such as in the morning before breakfast or while fasting. The difference is that while on Ultra Lite, a low level of ketosis is maintained throughout the day and night. This level is monitored at home using strips to test first morning urine. Although dietary carbohydrates are low, it is NOT an Atkin's-style diet. Proteins and carbohydrates are balanced in a way that is heart-healthy. Dietary options include various protein sources, vegetables, fruits, nuts, healthy oils and fats, as well as herbal seasonings, sea salt, and apple cider vinegar. Most people feel great and have more energy without hunger. Cravings for carbohydrates and sugar also diminish. Ultra Lite is a healthy weight loss diet that gives you results. Our Modified Mediterranean Eating Plan is More Than a Fad Diet FirstLine Therapy Program Our Modified Mediterranean Eating Plan is More Than a Fad Diet The FirstLine Therapy program treats the myriad of chronic health conditions related to the development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The plan includes a healthy diet almost anyone can follow, medical foods to support healthy body composition, and a regular exercise program. The Mediterranean-style eating plan is balanced and promotes natural weight loss over time. It is not a quick fix, but rather a plan that you can follow for life. Most people enjoy the flexibility and the variety of healthy foods that they can eat while following the plan. The FirstLine Therapy program has proven results in increasing lean body mass (muscle), reducing body fat, especially inflammatory belly fat, and better hydration and health of body cells. To start the program, there is an initial visit where baseline labs and [body composition testing](/weight-loss-programs-ct/first-line-therapy/#bodycomp) are obtained. Dr. Munro goes over the results of your testing and custom designs a diet and exercise plan to fit your needs.
