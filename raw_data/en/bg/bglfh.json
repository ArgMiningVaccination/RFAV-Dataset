Even though I've had [polycystic ovary syndrome](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pcos/symptoms-causes/syc-20353439) and its famous sidekick, cystic acne, for 10 years, I wasn't diagnosed with the hormonal syndrome or able to gain control over my cystic acne until recently. If you're anything like me, you've probably spent a lot of time and money trying to fix your cystic acne with over-the-counter products or DIY solutions. After nearly a decade of testing out what felt like every product on the market, from high-end to drugstore, and even DIY skincare, I've finally curated a nighttime skincare routine that kept my PCOS-inflicted acne at bay without additional medication. The products I've discovered work for me, but they may not work for everyone. Before we get to those, products, though, here's a bit of information that may help you on your search to find what works for you. What is PCOS and why does it cause acne? PCOS is a hormonal disorder that can create too much androgen (a hormone) in the body, increasing inflammation in the skin and leading to cystic acne. According to OB/GYN Dr. Felice Gersh, women with PCOS have three things that cause acne: high levels of androgen, systemic inflammation, and a deficiency of estradiol. Unlike normal acne, the cystic, hormonal kind is much more severe and painful \u2014 and in my experience, takes forever to heal. What's the difference between cystic acne caused by PCOS and other types of cystic acne? Cystic acne is usually hormone-related and found along the jawline, but it's not always caused by PCOS. Some cystic acne shows up when your hormones fluctuate around your period, but PCOS-related acne is more consistent. How it gets treated is really what makes all the difference. Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Manjula Jegasothy explains, \"With my PCOS patients, the main thing is to try to treat the PCOS with gynecology. Get that under control first, because any other acne treatments I do on you won't work unless you are curing the root cause from the inside.\" What kinds of over-the-counter products work best for cystic acne? To be clear, the fastest fix for any type of hormonal acne is actually medication prescribed by a doctor. \"Sadly, PCOS acne is among the most difficult to treat with conventional acne topical therapies, as it is so deep and cystic,\" says Dr. Gersh. \"Still, some natural products like tea tree oil and lavender oil can kill pathogenic bacteria and can even be dabbed on a superficial pimple.\" But ever since I spotted the first painful and unpoppable zit along my jawline, I've been curating my own routine of products designed to target acne-causing bacteria and oil production to at least get some semblance of my acne under control. Six steps might sound like a lot for a nighttime routine \u2014 especially when you just want to go to bed \u2014 but each of these has a specific purpose and visibly improved my acne-ridden skin. Below are the over-the-counter, PCOS-related acne products that have worked for me: A cleansing balm to remove makeup and oil without causing flare-ups [](https://shop-links.co/cgVnHMYki7g) A lot of cleansers and makeup removers have the reputation of stripping the skin of its good, nourishing oils. This one by Farmacy actually removes all the makeup and excess oil from the surface of my skin without leaving it with a taut or dry feeling before I've even got the chance to double cleanse. It's difficult, however, for me to find a makeup remover that actually removes every last bit of the eight layers of waterproof mascara and heavy foundation I like to wear, rather than smearing it all over my face and leaving me with panda eyes. This balm feels extremely gentle and lightweight on the skin, which I attribute to the fresh, natural, and somewhat surprising ingredients in it like exfoliating papaya and antioxidant-rich eggplant. While I can sometimes see my acne flaring up and getting red immediately after removing my makeup, this is one of the few makeup removers with which I've never felt that way, likely due to the anti-inflammatory bergamot oil and antimicrobial oil in it. A lightweight cleanser to balance oil production in the skin [](https://shop-links.co/cgVn5FH24BD) When I first tried this cleanser, I found it to be completely unmiraculous. It didn't stand out in any way, and that's exactly what I loved about it. One of my acne triggers is aggressive cleansers with irritating ingredients. This cleanser from The Ordinary doubles as a makeup remover, so I appreciate that it gets off any last bits of makeup that may be left on my face so I'm not left with any extra acne-causing bacteria sitting on my skin overnight. The hero ingredient of this cleanser is all in the name \u2014 squalane is renowned by skin gurus everywhere for its oil-balancing and anti-inflammatory ingredients. Though the point of a cleanser is of course to remove impurities from our skin, the great part of this one is that the squalane in it leaves my skin softer than before I used it, and my skin is noticeably less irritable after using it. I started using it about a year ago, and it's been a staple for my combination skin with oily and dry patches ever since \u2014 I've repurchased it several times. A vegan, cruelty-free toner in a convenient mist to soothe skin [](https://shop-links.co/cgVn0S9wALS) When the skin is still wet after cleansing, it is at its most vulnerable \u2014 a perfect time to put a direct acne treatment on it, because open pores and acne will really soak up the ingredients. A gynecologist and author of several books on PCOS, Dr. Felice Gersh says that salicylic acid is one of the best ways to topically treat acne when it specifically comes to women with PCOS because it's an acid exfoliant. I use this toner spray both day and night after cleansing, while my face is still wet. Not only is the jasmine scent totally intoxicating, the mist has a cooling effect on my skin which is especially soothing when my skin is feeling particularly irritable during a breakout. My favorite ingredient in this product is the most prominent one \u2014 jasmine water \u2014 because of its redness-reducing effects. A powerful retinol to increase cell turnover [](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipf_053019_pcos-acne-skincare-routine-20&h=003cff692a1dcc6541d0f169d79d766e7411de46150ee483bd6dd1841411b094&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f424fe&postSlug=guides%2Fbeauty%2Fpcos-acne-skin-care-products&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peterthomasroth.com%2Fprofessional-strength-3-retinoid-plus-1501019.html&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) When my acne was at its worst, I remember waking up in fear to a whole new set of pimples scattered across my face. Once I started using this product at night, the amount that happened went down significantly \u2014 almost immediately. I had heard a lot about the magic of retinoids, but this was the first one I used that didn't irritate my skin, likely due to the gentle [lactic acid](https://www.insider.com/guides/health/fitness/lactic-acid). Retinoids help increase skin cell turnover, so not only was my skin feeling plumper in general, but the new skin that was being produced was clear of acne. Plus, the scarring I had from previous breakouts wasn't nearly as severe as it used to be before I began using this. After my acne cleared up, I continued using this to [clear up the pigmentation on my skin](https://www.insider.com/guides/beauty/peter-thomas-roth-professional-3-retinoid-plus-review) and it worked really well. A prescription-level acne treatment but without the prescription [](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipf_053019_pcos-acne-skincare-routine-20&h=30d88ec89ab5f9ea51905a9b77d9be7684d6f2e8922f78e2f11d1371b374f92c&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f424fe&postSlug=guides%2Fbeauty%2Fpcos-acne-skin-care-products&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2FB07L1PHSY9&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) This gel used to be available only by prescription because it's that powerful, but it's available in beauty aisles now without one. My doctor first prescribed it to me when I was 13 but I promptly stopped using it when my skin became flaky and red almost overnight. I picked it back up at a drugstore a couple of years ago, armed with the knowledge I have now to balance out its drying ingredients. Incorporating this gel led to a significant decrease in the large, painful, cystic acne that I had on my jawline. According to Dr. Idriss, the Rx-strength retinol in this, known as adapalene, unclogs pores and prevents breakouts, but it's really strong, so be careful not to use it if you're trying to get pregnant. It was extremely effective with the worst kind of acne, but I personally had to pair it with a very thick, moisturizing night cream \u2014 which acts as the perfect segue to my next point. A glow-inducing Ayurvedic oil [](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipf_053019_pcos-acne-skincare-routine-20&h=29bc7f366c2067f6d54a1b35168f72c6a8fcff4c4945ba52f4f0e9932c7e5425&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f424fe&postSlug=guides%2Fbeauty%2Fpcos-acne-skin-care-products&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedetoxmarket.com%2Fproducts%2Fradiant-rani-illuminating-botanical-serum&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) Whether or not you have PCOS, knowing a breakout is coming on is the worst. You can feel it coming from beneath the surface. When I feel that, this serum is my go-to. Despite the fact that sesame oil is its primary ingredient, it truly does have the feel of a lightweight serum, and every single ingredient in it serves an acne-fighting purpose. More than acne-fighting vetiver, the turmeric and saffron in this are ingredients Indian women have been using for centuries to add a bit of glow to skin \u2014 Indian brides-to-be wash themselves in turmeric and saffron before their wedding days. Though my bridal days are far ahead of me, the ingredients in it give my skin a glow and the vetiver seems to stop acne below my skin from surfacing. I use it both day and night when I feel a breakout coming on, and have been using the cult-favorite product since I first met founder [Michele Ranavat](https://affiliate.insider.com/?amazonTrackingID=biipf_053019_pcos-acne-skincare-routine-20&h=ddcf83a0ab9e47f63c4d4561ee9e9a85d0401c9b783eca7b898c266113f9d7f2&postID=61b8efc7f2a36b1ac9f424fe&postSlug=guides%2Fbeauty%2Fpcos-acne-skin-care-products&site=in&u=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D35871X943606%26xs%3D1%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.thedetoxmarket.com%252Fproducts%252Fradiant-rani-illuminating-botanical-serum&platform=browser&sc=false&disabled=false) about two years ago. A light, nourishing cream [](https://shop-links.co/cgVn15FJT5l) This is the number one product I recommend to my friends suffering from acne because it's the most effective and fast-acting moisturizer. My sister who also has PCOS can't be bothered by having to use more than a cleanser and moisturizer in her skincare routine, so it works well for treating her acne, too. Every skincare lover knows about the magic of jojoba oil, which is one of the most prominent ingredients in this moisturizer. It's extremely nourishing and calming, and for the first time in years, I didn't wake up with a new pimple on my skin after using it (which is precisely why I recommend this to practically anyone who will listen to me). It's not that any one ingredient in here can help treat acne, but the formula is so balanced and gentle that it hasn't inflamed mine any worse. Yes, the price tag is hefty, but it's way less expensive than any facial I've gotten, and it also happens to be far more effective.
