This can only be done online, via [www.coronavaccinatie-afspraak.nl](https://www.coronavaccinatie-afspraak.nl/). The booster vaccination can be scheduled from 3 months after the last COVID-19 vaccination or from 3 months after recovery from COVID-19. Many vaccination sites will remain open during the holidays. The GGD is asking people to schedule booster vaccinations online to prevent the national call centre from overloading. Partner vaccinations are no longer being scheduled. Hundreds of thousands of calls are coming in every day. As a result, the call centre is under extreme pressure. In addition, we need to prevent the national telephone network from experiencing problems. Assistance to make an appointment Help each other to make an online appointment. People who need assistance can also watch [the video explaining how](https://uitlegprikafspraak.nl/) or consult the [step-by-step user manuals](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-vaccinatie/documenten/publicaties/2021/12/14/uitleg-maak-online-een-afspraak-voor-een-boostervaccinatie). These resources are available on the [website of the Dutch Government](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-vaccinatie/vraag-en-antwoord/hoe-maak-ik-een-afspraak-voor-vaccinatie-tegen-corona). People can also request assistance at the [public library](https://www.bibliotheek.nl/in-de-bibliotheek/informatiepunt-digitale-overheid.html). Appointment at home People who are unable to travel to a GGD vaccination site on their own or with assistance, for health reasons, do not have to do anything at this time. They will receive an extra notice for a booster vaccination at home. mRNA vaccines The booster vaccination involves an mRNA vaccine (Moderna or Pfizer). It does not matter which vaccine was received before. People cannot choose which. Omicron Until recently, the guideline in the Netherlands was to give the booster vaccination 6 months after the last vaccination. Due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, this has now been shortened to 3 months. As a result, more people will quickly have access to better protection against serious illness due to COVID-19. This is in the interest of public health. Earlier this year, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave the green light for a booster vaccination 3 months after the last basic vaccination. "}
