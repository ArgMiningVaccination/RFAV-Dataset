In honor of the [4th of July](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)) and the freedom, liberation, and autonomy it represents, let's dive into the ultimate feeling of freedom - feeling vibrantly healthy. Health Defined: What Does It Even Mean to Be \"Healthy\"? It's quite common to oversimplify health and equate it with simply eating healthy and working out. But the truth is, health encompasses so much more than that. While this physical layer of health is certainly important, how healthy you really feel also depends on some much deeper and more powerful mental and spiritual layers. All the working out and healthy eating in the world simply can't make up for mental unrest and spiritual disconnection. Your true source of health and vitality comes from finding balance and connection between your body, mind, and soul - with all parts being equally important. By aligning these pillars of health and living in a way that consciously aligns and uplifts your body, mind, and soul, you can tap into true well-being. And while we all logically know that our health is important, it can be helpful to dig deeper into why prioritizing our health is so crucial. Why Health Is Important In Our Lives Having a healthy body, mind, and soul is one of the most liberating and freeing feelings you can possibly experience. If you've ever experienced health challenges - whether it be physical, mental, or spiritual - you know firsthand how consuming and debilitating it can be. When you're grappling with your health, it can be challenging to just get through the day. Your health is truly foundational to absolutely everything in life. Health looks a little different for everyone. But tapping into your version of health allows you to enjoy life to the fullest. It allows you to pursue opportunities and take on challenges. It allows you to experience all of the things that life has to offer. It allows you to experience feeling good and feeling abundant - so you can take that vibrant feel-good energy and make meaningful contributions to the world. True health allows you to be present in the moment and connect with the people you hold dearest. Your health is the foundation of it all. So let's dive into some simple, easy-to-implement ways you can honor the gift of freedom we have to nourish, support, and optimize our well-being. Simple Ways to Support Your Physical Health Some simple and practical ways to support your physical well-being include: Eat a Healthy, Well-Rounded Diet: The food you eat is the most obvious way to support your physical health. But it can also oftentimes be one of the most challenging things to navigate. We are constantly bombarded with diet trends and what we should and shouldn't eat. But the truth is, eating in a way that nourishes and supports your health doesn't necessarily have to be complicated or restrictive. Because let's be honest - sometimes a big slice of chocolate cake is just downright good for your soul. While there may be certain foods you need to avoid or a certain protocol you may need to follow for a period of time if you're actively healing an underlying condition, eating \"healthy\" can actually be pretty simple. Centering most of your meals around whole foods that are \"from the earth\" is really the foundation of a healthy diet. Fresh fruits and veggies, high-quality proteins, healthy fats - if it's natural and comes from mother earth, it is likely going to support and nourish your body. Find Movement You Enjoy: Our bodies are designed to move. Now that doesn't mean you need to take up running or sign up for a gym membership. But finding ways to move your body that feel good is one of the pillars of health. Whether you enjoy hiking, dancing, lifting weights, or swimming, movement really is a form of medicine. Optimize Your Environment: We often don't consider how our environment can contribute to or detract from our physical health. But our external environment can be pivotal in our well-being. Our modern-day environments expose us to a plethora of health-disrupting toxins. Just some of these health-damaging toxins include: - Mold: Mold can be lurking in your home and wreak havoc on your health - disrupting [your digestive system](https://www.silvertreewellness.com/what-to-do-when-toxic-mold-causes-chronic-stomach-problems/), [your brain](https://www.silvertreewellness.com/can-mold-give-you-dementia-the-link-between-toxic-mold-and-alzheimers/), and [a whole lot more](https://www.silvertreewellness.com/toxic-mold-exposure-9-misconceptions-corrected-by-an-expert/). Evaluating your environment for mold and properly addressing any exposures can work wonders for healing and supporting your body. - Toxic chemicals: We are inevitably exposed to countless toxic chemicals on a daily basis. And many of those toxins can be found in our own homes. Things like cleaning products, air fresheners, beauty products, your furniture, and even the very walls of your home can emit dangerous toxins. You can reduce your exposure to these toxins by making simple shifts like buying cleaner cleaning and beauty products and investing in a high-quality indoor air filtration system. - Contaminated water: Tap water is notoriously contaminated with toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and even pharmaceutical drugs. Considering our body is over 50% water, regularly drinking tap water can put a damper on your health. Investing in a quality water filter that removes these toxic contaminants is one of the best things you can do for your body. - EMF's: EMF stands for electromagnetic fields and is a form of energy or low level radiation. While not all EMFs are bad (the sun, the earth and even your own cells emit EMFs) the ones emitted by technological devices like cell phones, computers, and Wi-Fi can be detrimental to your health. Taking a few minutes to unplug your devices before bed, keeping your cell phone out of your pocket, and investing in EMF-shielding devices can go a long way in protecting you from these harmful waves of energy. Our environments are often overlooked aspects of our health. But optimizing our external world can work wonders for optimizing our internal well-being. Get Outside: Humans are designed to be tuned in with nature. For example, the sun is incredibly healing and can help boost your health by: - Helping set your circadian rhythm and support better sleep patterns - Increasing levels of crucial nutrients like Vitamin D - Boosting levels of important neurotransmitters like serotonin that help improve your mood - Combatting inflammation Getting even a few minutes of direct sunlight everyday can make a big difference. And to really tap into the healing power of nature, try soaking up the sunshine in your bare feet or by laying out in the cool grass. Putting your body in direct contact with the earth is called grounding and can have a ton of health benefits that you can [read more about by clicking right here](https://www.silvertreewellness.com/what-is-earthing-boost-health-grounding-connecting-to-mother-earth/). Simple Ways to Support Your Mental Health Some straight-forward and powerful ways to promote your mental health include: Prioritize Quality Sleep Sleep deprivation can put a serious damper on your mental health. Sleep deprivation can disrupt the delicate balance of hormones and neurotransmitters your brain relies on to regulate your mood and cause a major spike in your stress hormones. But sometimes getting a good night's sleep is easier said than done. Some simple strategies that may help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer include: - Shutting off all electronics at least 30 minutes before bed - Getting some direct sunlight first thing in the morning - Ensure your room is dark, cool, and quiet - Turn on a fan or some kind of soothing background noise - Avoid caffeine, alcohol, or intense exercise late in the evening Getting regular restful nights of slumber is one of the keys to mental well-being. Get Your Stress Under Control Your body's stress response is designed to be temporary - ramping up for short periods of time to help you survive. But in today's hectic fast-paced world, many of us are constantly stressed out - keeping our stress response activated far too long. These elevated stress levels can throw your hormones out of whack, make you feel miserable, and even trigger alterations at the cellular level - leading to a whole host of negative consequences for your health. Finding ways to simplify your life and remove unnecessary stress while also finding healthy ways to cope with the unavoidable stressors in life is one of the best things you can do for your mental health. Have Fun Our world tends to be highly focused on achievement and reaching for the next goal. And amidst all of the striving for progress and trying to reach the next level, it can be easy to forget that life is supposed to be fun. So take time each day - even if it's just a few minutes - to do something that's actually fun. Watch a comedy. Play a game. Plan a trip. Get goofy with your loved ones. Just do something that feels fun. You'll be amazed at how quickly infusing a little more fun in your life can drastically improve your mood and mental health. Simple Ways to Support Your Spiritual Health A couple of potent ways to support and uplift your soul and your spiritual well-being include: Incorporate Mind-Body Medicine Strategies Your thoughts, feelings, and beliefs have a monumental impact on your well-being - especially when it comes to your spiritual health. When we're stuck in a negative cycle - constantly finding ourselves experiencing negative thoughts and feelings - it disconnects us from ourselves, from the world, and from life. Incorporating some powerful mind-body medicine practices can help you create and maintain an inner dialogue that supports you and uplifts you. The specifics of mind-body medicine are far too robust to dive into in this article, so I encourage you to head over and read my article [Ultimate Guide To Mind-Body Medicine: Is What You Think Making You Sick](https://www.silvertreewellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-mind-body-medicine-is-what-you-think-making-you-sick/). Connect With Others We are designed to connect with one another. Sharing life's joys and life's struggles with others who love and support us is one of the greatest spiritual gifts we can give ourselves and those we love. It can be easy to put off spending time with our loved ones or to guard our hearts. But spending time with, having fun with, and connecting with people who make us feel good is like fuel for the soul.
