Center Budget: $10,000,000 Project Period: May 15, 2005-May 14, 2010 Project Summary : CAMRA is a consortium of scientis ts who have extens ive expertise in quantitative microbial risk a ssessment (MRA) methods, biosecurity and infectious disease transmission through environmental exposures. CAMRA has two main goals. The first is a technical mission to have develope d critically reviewed and interp reted sets of models, tools and information that will be used in a credible risk assessment framework to reduce or eliminate health impacts from deliberate use of biological ag ents of concern (BAC) as bioterrorists agents in the indoor and outdoor environment. The s econd mission is to build a national network for MRA for knowledge management, learning and transfer, for the community of scientists, and students via educational programs and community of professionals in the field and in our communities. There are five major research proj ects which will define the goals and activities of CAMRA. Each project goal has been developed through collaborati ve efforts of scientists and will be integrated via a management structure that facilitates inte raction. They address exposure, methods and models; dose-response; populati outcomes; risk frameworks; knowledge management, transfer and learni ng. Overall these projects will focus on assessments, lessons learned, new science and research, databases, tools and methods and finally knowledge building for learning and communication purposes. Expected Results or Benefits : We anticipate that CAMRA will produce a suite of outcomes for government officials and first re sponders as well as the resear ch, education, and professional communities. We will provide documentation on the sensitivity and specificity of risk assessment methods and their ability to address levels of safety. A toolbox with validated surrogates for BAC will be produced. The fate and transport of bioterrorist agents in water distribution systems, air and buildings will be ev aluated. Models for ch aracterizing exposure via aerosols and the indoor environment that are validat ed with real-world data where available. We will produce an inventory of critically analys ed dose-response relationships for Category A agents and mechanistic dose-response models (based on physiological-b ased, dose-response). Stochastic and deterministic dynamic disease transmission population models (accounting for heterogeneity in exposure), models for assessing controls (eg. vaccines, quarantines, decontamination, clinically in tervention and treatment) .

Gerba, University of Arizona gerba@ag.arizona.edu Chris Choi, University of Arizona cchoi@cals.arizona.edu Ian Pepper, University of Arizona ipepper@ag.arizona.edu Syed Hashsham, Michigan State University, hashsham@msu.edu Paul Keim, Mark Nicas, University Berkley nazaroff@ce.berkeley Tom McKone, University of California, Berkley temckone@lbl.gov Institutions : University of Arizona, Northern Arizona University, Michigan State University, University of California Berkley Project Summary The goal of this project is to improve our abil ity to quantify exposure to biological agents of concern (Category A and B agen ts) in drinking water system s and indoor air environments. Because BAC agents are too hazardous to work with in the environmen ts we wish to study, it will be necessary to develop surrogates so th at assessments can be made under real world conditions. This project draws toge ther several groups with extensiv e experience in the detection, transport and fate of BAC in aerosols, water an d fomites, and transmission dynamics of Category A and B agents in the environment. This goal w ill be met through a series of specific sub-project objectives Including: 1) Devel opment of BAC surrogates 2) Va lidation of detection methods (Assessment of best methods; Surrogate methods id entification; Sample needs for risk models; Gene sequences as a tool in risk assessmen t); 3) Modeling BAC in water systems (model development and design; Field studies utilizing th e Water Village); 4) Survival and transfer via fomite surfaces; 5) Development and validatio n of a discrete-time Markov chain model for Airborne BAC within a room. 6) Evaluation of par ticle fate and transport in a room; 6) Model for resuspension of particles and 7) Determin ation particle size di stribution in aerosols. EXPECTED RESULTS AND BENEFITS: It is anticipated that th is Project will result in an improvement in the ability to determine the expos ure to BAC during contamination events in the indoor environment (air and surfaces) and via wate r. Thus an assessment of the detection methods and better exposure estimates will inform the risk framework and the management strategies that are needed including cl ean up targets defined by \"safety\" levels.

Investigators : Joseph N.S. Eisenberg and James Koopma n; Collaborating Investigators: Alan Hubbard, Arthur Reingold (UC Berkeley). Email: eisenber@socrates.Berkeley.EDU ; jkoopman@umich.edu Institutions : Univ. California Berkeley, University of Michigan. Project Summary : I) Objectives : The recent increase in the concern of bioterrorism has expanded the needs of microbia l risk assessment. We propos e to develop a methodology that provides explicit links between th e models of environmental expos ure and models of the disease process, focusing on how heterogeneity will impact risk. This methodology will be used to integrate environmental and dose-re sponse data and to aid in: a) early detection of outbreaks; b) planning for both short- a nd long-term control efforts, and c) se tting research agendas. To this end, we propose the following three specific ai ms: 1) To develop appropriate transmission models that are dynamic and provide spatially explicit details of in fection spread through populations; 2) To use existing data sets to identify parameters of interest including secondary transmission rates, contact pa tterns, and dose response functions; and 3) To use the models developed in the previous objectiv es to analyze different outbreak scenarios associated with local contamination, to examine the efficacy of local c ontrol actions at different environmental points or within different population groups, and to develop and evaluate sampling and analysis methods that can be used under the emergency cond itions of a bioterrorist related outbreak, as a guide for resource allocation. II) Approach : In Aim 1 we will construct models of transmission through water and through droplet spread involving direct contact, fomite s, and surfaces at envir onmental sites. These models will include descriptions of the pathogen fate and transport processes within the environment. We also plan to develop approaches for identifying values for parameters used in a given model. In Aim 2, therefore, we plan to fi rst create a database of information important to parameterizing and identifying models, and second to examine a variety of statistical techniques that address the problems associated with highl y parameterized nonlinear models. In Aim 3 we plan to develop scenario models for evaluating bi oterrorist control strategies, analyze strategies that can be used in emergency situations, and propose ways to use environmental measurements to guide control actions EXPECTED RESULTS OR BENEFITS This research will contribute essential elements to control of a bioterrorist disease outbreak related to infections and cont ribute the essential t ools for analyzing bioterrorist emergency situations involving tr ansmissible agents.

Haas, Drexel University ( haas@drexel.edu ) Carole Bolin, Michigan State University ( bolinc@dcpah.msu.edu ) Institutions : Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI Project Summary : The objectives of the proposed work are to: 1) To determine the applicability of exponentia l, beta-Poisson and other previously used dose-response models to the Category A bioterro rist agents via the oral, inhalation and dermal routes. 2) To assess the validity of animal to human extrapolation of dose-response. 3) To assess the influence of modifying f actors (e.g., host age) on dose-response. 4) To develop a new class of physiologically-based dose-response functions and to test their applicability on biot errorist agents. 5) To conduct animal studies which will help inform the development of the above dose- response models. We will review the archival literature and the \"gray\" literature for data sources to inform dose-response models, and subject that data to a systematic quality screen. We will fit candidate dose-response models to each data set, test st rain and host differences, and assess the impact of other variables (such as host age). We will te st the dose-response fits to available data on outbreak or endemic cases (where such information is available). We will use information on the in vivo fate, transport, and dynamics, of pathoge ns in humans and non-human hosts to develop models that start with the ingested/inhaled/derm al dose, predict the dose at the point of colonization and the extent of reproduction, a nd use these predictions in a dose-response relationship for outcome. It is our hypothesis that such models may be useful in assessing factors associated with different host-sensitivities, effect of concomitant exposures to other materials, and interspecies extrapolations. We will conduct animal studies to assess the infectivity of certain select pathogens where ther e appear to be significa nt data gaps. These studies will inform the development of both \"cl assical\" and physiologically based dose-response models. EXPECTED RESULTS OR BENEFITS This project will produce a reference set of critically reviewed dose-response relationships for Category A agents. By compiling dose-response relationships in various hosts and for various strains, in conjunction with info rmation from other projects in CAMRA, we will be able to ascertain the inter-(microbe)species heterogeneity in infectivity, and determine whether there are discernable genetic markers whic h may be correlated to such differences. This may facilitate an assessment of the potential for fu rther alterations in a st rain to change potency.

Email contact: pgurian@drexel.edu . Institutions: Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Project Period: May 15, 2005-May 14, 2010 Project Summary Objectives: This project will link the techni cal research on bio-threats conducted in other CAMRA projects with the societal goal of managi ng the risk of bioterrorism through two related research efforts. The first effort will use techni ques from decision analysis to prio ritize research efforts based on their ability to improve the respons e to bioterrorism incidents. The second effort will identify and begin to address critical issues of public pe rception that have the potential to influence the public's compliance with response and mitigation plans. Approach: An integrated model of bio-threat fate and tr ansport, dose-response, secondary transmission, and mitigation actions will be developed. The ability of alternative research efforts to reduce uncertainties in different inputs to this integrat ed model will be assessed. Value-of-information calculations will be conducted to identify the res earch strategies most likely to yield knowledge that improves the response to bioterrorism inci dents. Risk communication priorities will be identified using the \"mental models\" approach. This begins with an assessment of expert knowledge and representation of this knowledge in an influence diagra m. Baseline public knowledge and attitudes are assessed by semi-str uctured interviews and surveys. The lay knowledge is then compared to the expert model and key misconceptions and information deficiencies are identified. Future risk comm unication efforts may then be directed towards addressing these key deficiencies. EXPECTED RESULTS OR BENEFITS: This project will identify promising research strate gies with the potential to improve the societal management of bioterrorism risk. In addi tion, it will develop a list of risk communication priorities for both pre-event public education an d post-event response plans. This project will link together Projects I-III th rough the development of an inte grated model and will identify critical information for inclusion in the knowledge and information repositories of Project V.

Project Period: Starting on April 1st, 2005 and ending on March 31st, 2010 Project Summary : It is the overall objective of this project to investigate and implement effective and efficient methods to enhance the unders tanding of microbial risk a ssessment (MRA) as a body of knowledge. For this purpose, we focus on edu cation and collaboration in combination with technological methods to promote knowledge le veraging, management, transfer and learning among members of the Center for Advancing Mi crobial Risk Assessment (CAMRA). These are the objectives, approaches, and expe cted results from this project: 1. Build an online collaborative repository. This will be a knowledge repository because it will use learning units represented as a knowledge fo rmalism. Learning units will specify the task where they can be reused. The knowledge repository will promote knowledge leveraging and sharing among CAMRA's members. 2. Reason with learning units for knowledge di scovery. The learning units are amenable to automated reasoning. Reasoning methods can leverage MRA's knowledge. 3. Build a data warehouse from data linked to the learning units. Additional knowledge discovery methods can be applied over the data warehouse. The data warehouse will be publicly available. 4. Develop targeted educational programs EXPECTED RESULTS OR BENEFITS: Approaches will achieve development of an intellectual knowledge base and a CAMRA website and other dissemination means. This will support the community of practic e for risk assessment prin cipals. Produce productive and effective knowledge sharing. Finally research da ta will be used to develop a framework for different community of users for MRA for BA C and recommendations for policy to reduce the risk of transmission of select and other agents to populations in the U.S .. Educational programs will produce core graduate level courses for MRA, on-line learning tools and workshops to support collaborations and common aims.

CAMRA is comprised of seven University teams (Figure E1) Figure 1. CAMRA participants: Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), Drexel University, Michigan State University (MSU) , Northern Arizona University (NAU) , University of Arizona (UA), University of California at Be rkeley (UCB), University of Michigan (UM). The Mission of CAMRA CAMRA has twin missions. The first is a tech nical mission to have developed critically reviewed and interpreted sets of models, tools and information that will be used in a credible risk assessment framework to reduce or eliminate heal th impacts from deliberate use of biological agents of concern (BAC) as biot errorists agents in the indoor and outdoor environment. The second mission is to build a national network fo r MRA for knowledge management, learning and transfer, for the community of scientists, comm unity of students via e ducational programs and community of professionals in the field and in our communities. The Vision and Rationale of CAMRA Microbial risk assessment has been developed a nd used during the past 20 years to address concerns associated with the quality of our water and food and directly waterborne and foodborne disease transmission (Haas, Rose, and Gerba, 1999; Eisenberg et al., 2002 [see cv of principal investigators). These risk assessments have assisted the EPA (Macler and Regli, 1993) and USDSA/FDA (Buchanan and Whiting, 1996) in developing regulatory policy and implementing management plans. The recent in crease in the concern of bioterrorism has expanded the needs of microbial risk assessment. In the context of bioterrorism four important objectives are: 1) To assess the damage/risk (impact and spread) of different plausible bioterrorism scenarios in orde r to aid in policy and decisi on-making for preparedness and response; 2) To improve effectiveness and enhance safety of the response in the event of a bio- terrorist attack, by improving public health surveillance of envi ronmental exposure, infection, The Center Co-Directors Dr. Rose (MSU) and Dr. Haas (Drexel) as well as the principal investigators all have a long history (as much as 20 years) of working together on advancing the data, information and knowledge on microbial risk assessment and infectious disease. CAMRA represents a crescendo of those efforts. 9and disease as well as infection control actions like contact tracing, early detection of infections, treatment, isolation, quarantine, chemoprophylaxis , vaccination, and decontamination; 3) To guide research into the development of tools a nd biomonitoring strategies for infectious disease BAC detection in environmental samples, that will best help infection cont rol during bioterrorist episodes (eg. disinfection); and 4) To develop prevention and monitoring strategies for public health protection in general from BAC. There is a heightened concern for future bioterro rist events since the fall 2001 anthrax incident and it has become clear that there is a lack of knowledge with respect to certain important questions regarding exposure to infectious BAC, particularly those that can be transmitted by inhalation. Notably, the stipul ation of \"safe\" (or unsafe) levels, or cleanup goals following a contamination event have not been well define d using science-based and risk-based methods. The question \"How Clean is Clean\" has not yet been answered in the concrete with respect to bioterrorist agents (Raber et al. , 2001) and in fact the same is true for many other environmental BAC. The development of a microbial risk framework re levant to bioterroism issues requires focused research on some important properties of outbrea ks and disease transmission that would arise from a bioterrorist incident. To accurately characterize the risk will require models that are dynamic, that focus specifically on the key BAC, can account for the heterogeneous nature of the disease process, and can clearly link exposure to health effects. The vision of CAMRA is to provide explicit links between the models of e nvironmental exposure and models of the disease process, focusing on how heterogeneity will im pact risk, evaluation of uncertainty and advancement of the knowledge base for MRA. The Research Objectives of CAMRA There are five major research projects which wi ll define the goals and activities of CAMRA. Each project goal has been developed through collabo rative efforts of scientists with more than one University involved. Overall these project s will focus on assessments, lessons learned, new science and research, databases, tools and methods and finally knowledge building for learning and communication purposes. \u0083 Project I. Exposure: Detection, Fate and Transport of Biological Agents of Concern (BAC). [Lead: Dr. Charles Gerba UA] The overal l goal of this project is to improve the ability to determine the exposure to BAC during contamination events in the indoor environment (air and surfaces) and via water. Thus an assessment of the detection methods and better exposure estimates will inform the ri sk framework and the management strategies that are needed including clean up targets defined by \"safety\" levels. Specific Objectives: Development of new BAC surrogates for applic ation in methods assessment and modeling efforts. (Gerba, UA; Hashsham, MSU; Keim, NAU) assessment. ( Hashsham & Rose, MSU; Keim, NAU) Development of fate and transport models fo r BAC on fomites (surfaces). (Gerba & Choi, UA) Development of fate and transport models for BAC in water systems. (Gerba & Choi, UA; Haas, Drexel) 10Development and validation of a discrete-t ime Markov chain model for Airborne BAC within a room. (Nicas , UCB; Haas, Drexel) Measure the re-suspension of particle-associa ted BAC in a test room or chamber (Nicas, UCB) Determine the particle size distribution of respiratory aerosol (Nicas, UCB) \u0083 Project II. Infectious Disease Models for Assessing Microbial Risks and Developing Control Strategies. [Lead: Dr. Joseph Eisenberg, UCB] Th e overall goal of this project is to develop a methodology that provid es explicit links between th e models of environmental exposure and models of the disease process, fo cusing on how heterogeneity will impact risk. This methodology will be used to integrate environm ental and dose-response data and to aid in: a) early detection of outbreaks; b) planning for both short- and l ong-term control efforts, and c) setting research agendas. Specific Objectives Developing transmission models (Eisenberg, UCB; Koopman, UM) Model parameterization and identifiab ility (Eisenberg, UCB; Koopman, UM) Modeling Outbreaks (Eisenberg, UCB; Koopman, UM; Bolin, MSU; Keim, and Applications . [Lead Dr. Charles Haas, Drexel] The overall goal of this proj ect is to comprehensively revi ew and analyze dose response relationships for BAC and develop mechanistic mode ls from animal studies. This will inform the population modeling, and facilitate decisi on making (emergency response and monitoring) with comprehensive risk-based assessment of detection technology and cleanup alternatives. Specific Objectives Development of dose-response relationships. (Haas, Drexel) Development of Physiologically based dose -response models. (Haas, Drexel; Bolin, MSU). \u0083 IV. Assessment- Analysis Interface. [Lead: Dr. Patrick Gurian, Drexel] The goal of this project is to use analytical approaches fr om statistics, decision analysis, and psychology to produce a prioritization of data and information needs and to identify, and begin to address, social factors that can signifi cantly influence risk. By focu sing research efforts on productive lines of inquiry, this project has the potential to greatly improve the pract ical usefulness of the results derived from the proposed research center. Specific Objectives Identification of scenarios and modeling tools (Gurian, Drexel; Casman & Small, CMU) Public perception of Bio-th reat risks (Casman, CMU) Development of probabilistic Drexel; Casman, CMU) Manageme nt, Discovery. [Leads: Dr. Rosina Weber & Dr. Ewen Todd] The overall goal is to provide effec tive and efficient technological support for group collaborations, that results in a know ledge repository linked to a data repository, where knowledge can be discovered and leveraged, helping to advance diff erent fields of study including programs in higher education and out reach to the community of professionals. Specific Objectives Build an online repository based on evolvi ng learning unit. (Web er & Haas, Drexel; Rose, MSU) Reason with learning units for knowledge disc overy. (Weber, Drexel & Exec. Steering Committee) Build data ware house from data linked to the learning units (Weber & Gurian, Drexel; & Exec. St eering and Integration Team ESI) Produce targeted educational programs: (g raduate level curriculum, online learning tools, workshop series (Todd, Rose, MSU & ESI) Needs, Expected Benefits and Outcomes There are a number of disease causing microorgani sms which have characteristics that would facilitate their use as agents for terrorist type of activities or as biological weapons [ability to be produced in large amounts, purifie d, stored and delivered to larg e populations] and a number of biological agents of concern (BAC) have been w eaponized particularly for aerosol dispersion as inhalation can often cause more severe outcomes. Historically, there are records of poisoning of the water supply as early as the 6th Century B.C ., use of plague in 1348 by the Mongols in the city of Caffa and use of Small pox in the French & Indian War. In our more recent history, in 1984 the Rajneeshee Cult contaminated salad bars with S. typhimurium (where 750+ individuals became ill) in an attempt to influe nce an election outcome in Oregon (Torok et al., 1997) and finally the experience of the Anthrax le tters contamination event of 2001 is still quite fresh in our minds (Jernigan et al. 2001). In fact , anthrax has been reportedly used more often as a real threat or implicated in a hoax than any other BAC. Figure 2. Human Plague New and emerging BAC and outbreaks of familiar diseases are constantly in the news. An anthrax outbreak killing 1500 animals in two cons ervation areas next to one of Zimbabwe's largest game parks, was the first and largest event ever reported in that part of the world in September ( AP From correspondents in Harare, September 27, 2004) . The Cruise ship outbr eaks of norovirus are a significant concern for the tourism industry. Human cases of plague continue to be reported in the US ( www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/plague/ plagwest.htm Figure E2). 12The rapid global spread of SARS is a prime exampl e of an emerging virus, with the potential to kill, that was found to thwart efforts of traditiona l infection control (Wu, 2003; WHO, 2003) and required genetic approaches to help identify the threat. Thus there is a need to study and distinguish between intentional and natura lly-occurring outbreaks and address these emerging threats. The prevention and cont rol of infectious diseases requires an understanding of the ways bacteria, viruses and fungi are sp read. Knowledge of the transmission systems [including environmental transport and survival] of many BAC is incomplete; thus we need to greatly enhance our data and models for the ability to effectively predict and anticipate the extent of an epidemic following a bioterrorist event, and control the outcome and exposures where possible. The new challenges for homeland secur ity require improved levels of specificity regarding the infectious agent and assessment of exposure. Met hodologies for BAC detection. in air, water, and on surfaceswill need sensitivity at the level and extent of exposure to be relevant to health outcomes. CAMRA principal investigators all have expe rience with many of the category B and C BAC and have been involved in MRA for enteric bacteria E. coli and wate rborne exposures. Thus the models and risk framework have been investigated, produced and peer-reviewed and can be readily addressed by CAMRA in the case of a specific event or identified need. However, the MRA data, models and frameworks for the category A agents of concern are less well developed and will be the focus of CAMRA. The outcomes and benefits to science will be evaluated using both traditional quantifiable measures, as well as in more qualitative and descriptive terms. All CAMRA projects will be expected to produce peer-reviewed publications. The development of new methods, models and tools will also be used as qua ntifiable measures of productivity . CAMRA is based on a model for interdisciplinary research, and integration of the results of each project will forge new scientific approaches to assessi ng microbial and infectious disease risk. One of the clear goals of the CAMRA is knowledge transfer: contribu ting to solving health problems, preventing exposure and illness, and addressing key questions of greatest uncertainty. CAMRA efforts will be at least partially focused on having an impact on the \"state of practic e\" in the MRA field. Review criteria will also include the extent of interaction and co llaboration with industry, federal and local government groups including EPA a nd DHS. We anticipate that CAMRA will produce at minimum the following: 1) Living documen t on the sensitivity and specificity of methods and their ability to addre ss levels of safety. 2) In-use vali dation of methods. 3) Toolbox with validated surrogates for BAC. 3) Platform to asse ss the fate and transport of bio terrorist agents water distribution systems, air and buildings. 4) Validated models for characterizing exposure via aerosols and the indoor environment. 5) Inve ntory of critically an alysed dose-response relationships for Category A agents. 6) Valida tion where outbreak data can be obtained. 7) Mechanistic dose-response models (based on physiological-based, dos e-response). 8) Stochastic and deterministic dynamic diseas e transmission population models (accounting for heterogeneity in exposure) 9) Models for assessing contro ls (eg. vaccines, quarantines, decontamination, clinically intervention and treatment) 10) Goal s for decontamination based on risk and safety. 11) A framework that incor porates risk assessment data, evidence and science-based information for decision makers eg. government o fficials, health provide rs and first responders. 12) Risk communication priorities to offset counterproductive public perceptions before and after a bioattack. 13Management and Communication Plans Management within CAMRA Dr. Rose (MSU) and Dr. Haas (Drexe l) will serve as co-directors of CAMRA. Dr. Rose will direct from the l ead institution and will be responsible for the financial management of the center and will serve as the quality assurance officer for the overall Center. She will be responsible for overseeing the integration team efforts (including the travel budget associated with project and integration team meetings) as well as specifically interacting with projects focusing on methods issues and educational programs. Dr. Haas will be responsible for overseeing and inte racting with all projects and th e associated quantitative data and models. Each co-director will have administ rative support. Each project will be lead by a project leader who will be res ponsible for the communications between the project investigators and Executive Steering and Integration team (ESI). Key to the success of CAMRA is the activitie s of the ESI team, who will meet at least twice per year. ESI Team Institution MSU Drexel UC UA U. MICH CMU Individual Rose Haas Weber Nicas EisenbergGerba Koopman Casman This ESI team will have dual purposes. First they will represent the institution and assist in the integration of communication a nd educational components of CA MRA, but more importantly they will serve to examine the overall objectives of the center, the progress and the integration of the various project data and outcomes. Minutes , action items and outcomes will be recorded during the meetings. ESI team will also be re sponsible for producing published manuscripts and various reports via the integrati on of all projects. The cross li nkages of the investigators and projects can be viewed via the type of agent (Table 1) and th e structure of the CAMRA (Figure 3; 2004) as well as via the ILSI MRA framework (Figure 4, ILSI, 1996).

For example, Dr. Casman (CMU, project IV) has published on the evaluation of micr obiological diagnostic tools for bioterroism agents (Casman, 2004), and can use a similar appro ach to assist integra tion of group I detection methods levels of sensitivity with group II dose- response models to evaluate the levels of \"safety\" that current and new environmental bi osensors can afford. Dr. Koopman (U.Mich, project II) has published on population transmi ssion of smallpox as well as impacts of vaccination (Koopman, 2003; 2004). Through interac tion with groups I and II (dose-response and population heterogeneity), this model can be enha nced. Project IV (beh avioral realism) will also assist in this analysis. The proposed center will be organized such that knowledge management and transfer (project V) is integral to the design and conduc t of the research, and the responsib ility of all investigators. However, the expertise of Dr. Rosina Weber will guide this process utilizing the principals of computational intelligence and frameworks that w ill assist in meta analysis of data bases. Dr. Weber will meet with each University team in the first year to assist in both the communication and learning process needed to build and utilize these programs. Inherent in the problem-driven approach we have outlined, is the expectation that investigators focus their activities by understandi ng how to build fundamental knowledge that provides a foundation for addressing the MRA framework. This will be accomplished by use of a co-learning model, Risk Assessment for Biosecurity Problem Formulation (Scenarios and Goals) Analysis (Exposure | Effects) Characterization (Impact of Contamination Event, Intentional or Natural)Conceptual Framework Risk Management1) Dose-response in animals and humans for development of probability of infection models by ingestion and inhalation. 2) Genetic diversity of the microbial virulence for assessment of health risk. 3) Survival and transport models for assessment of exposure. 4) Specificity, sensitivity and quantitation needs for monitoring approaches and detection technologies. 5) Safety goals for remediation and decontamination response.NEEDSDr. Rose, Dr. Haas, Dr. Gerba and Dr. Eisenberg were all part of the original ILSI workshop that produced the MRA framework. Note that population modeling (the approach for integrating dose-response, exposure, individual and population models) as well as management options, are not features of this structure. 16 whereby we initiate a dialog at the research design stage. Because the various disciplines that are involved in building the data bases for MRA, all use diffe rent languages, models and type of information, building a management and transfer system that will lend it self to communication with a variety of user groups is essential. The core research program of the proposed cen ter will be designed to develop fundamental understanding of environmental tr ansfer of BAC and potential health outcomes. New knowledge will be the priority. An important component of the knowledge transfer program will be to both encourage and assist investigators in communicating their results to th e broadest possible pr ofessional audience, in addition to their peer research community. Select ed findings that are likely to have widespread interest will be prepared as re search briefs, review articles, web pages, and trade magazine articles, as appropriate. Other knowledge transfer approaches th at we have experience with include conferences and seminars, videotapes, tr aining manuals, software, patents, and specialty equipment. Where appropriate, resources wi ll be devoted to these types of products. Internal and external educational programs will be developed. This will be managed by Project V leader Dr. Ewen Todd, however, input from all the institutions will be important and will be achieved with direct communica tions and via the ESI team.

CAMRA Scientific Advisory Committee. This committee will be science-based. It will be made up of four to five outside experts in fi elds such as epidemiology, biosensors, modeling, environmental microbiology, communication, biosecuri ty and may be involve individuals from government or academia but who will be chosen for their scientific expertis e. An international member will be considered. This will be a mi x of professionals in 1) public health (eg. Dr. Art Reingold, Dr. Tomas Aragon, Dr. Jack Colf ord, all from UCB; CDC Dr. Deborah Levy; Dr. Paul Hunter, from PHLS in England). 2) Environmental microbiologist s, (Dr. Suresh Pillai; Dr. Mark Sobsey) 3) Risk assessment/analysi s, eg. Dr. Paul Gale; 4) Disease transmission, (Dr. Travis Porco here at the C DHS, experts in Class A BAC, eg. smallpox) and/or 5) clinical microbiologists. The role of the advisory committee will be pr oviding advice on 1) the Project programs and specific objectives; 2) advice on integration a nd 3) and advice on communication. They will meet with the ESI team once per year. Communication and Activiti es Outside the Center One of the goals of CAMRA is to build collabo rations and communications with researchers, educators, government and community officials w ho may be interested in or users of the MRA data, information, tools and framew orks. We will establish linka ges with the other centers for DHLS (Table E-2) where appropriate. We current ly have links as a pa rtner institution to the Center for Food Protection and Defense, and MS U is playing a major role in the education program framework in which CAMRA can become a pa rtner. We have also received a letter of interest from Center for Foreign Anim al and Zoonotic Disease Defense. As individuals, the investigators of CAMRA have built collaborations throughout the US and world, collectively we will build stronger relations hips with organizations (International Food Institute) government groups (US Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine) and international research in stitutions (Universit y of Cordoba, Spain, Canadian Early CBRN Attack Detection by Computeriz ed Medical Record Surveillanc e) [see letters of support, Appendix A]. Thus knowledge repositories can be shared with the larger scientific community interested in MRA. 20 Table 2 Department of Homeland Security Centers of Excellence.

Addressing the Future Issues One has only to read the headlines to realize that there are growing concerns regarding the spread of infectious diseases and our ability to contro l them. Our sensitive populations (elderly and immunocompromised) are increasing in numbers in many of our communities. The flu vaccine shortage has provoked a reexamination of public h ealth priorities and practices. The assumptions and methodologies of the last cent ury need to be revised in light of demographic and security projections. CAMRA microbial risk assessments will be structured to incorporate new developments. In addition to risks from pure cultures of liv ing microorganisms, CAMRA collaborators have a strong interest in risk fr ameworks for BAC such as Clostridium botulinum toxin. In addition, the 21 potential risks associated with the exposure to a mixture of BAC will be examined using quantitative risk methods. There are new BAC which have been inade quately studied. Recent reports have suggested that the organism Burkholderia pseudomallei (the causative agent of melioidosis) is a significant potential choice for bioterrorism (it survives in the environment, could be spread by aerosols, can be acquired from the natural environment and causes mortality) yet very little quantitative data are available to address this BAC from a MRA perspective. CAMRA will begin an incident watch and devel op an incident fund for addressing emerging and important BAC. Thus as the programs evolve at CAMRA, if emerging na tional events occur or new specific data and information can be gleane d from some natural or intentional disease outbreak, a team of microbial risk assessors can be mobilized to develop a research agenda to advance our understanding of the disease processes a nd controls that will be needed to face new threats in the future. Program Evaluation CAMRA will utilize a logic model over time to a ddress establishment of program direction, implementation, an evaluation framework and outc omes. MSU programs have experience with the logic model system and have utilized th e guide produced by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation (W.K. Kellogg Foundation Logic Model Development Guide, www.wkkf.org ) for this purpose. Thus this will help to address the resources, operations and future activities, as well as provide a framework for examining how well we are doing. The program will be evaluated by 1] resource a nd inputs, 2] activities, 3] outputs 4] outcomes and 5] impact. While assist ance can be obtained via a professional evaluator, the ESI team and advisory committee as well as stakeholders from the various user commun ities of the MRA data, information and knowledge repositori es will be valuable in deve loping a collaborative process for both evaluating and maintaini ng a successful program. 22 References Buchanan R.

Exposure: Detection, Fate and Transport of Agents Introduction The overall goal of this project is to im prove our ability to quantify exposure to biological agents of concern (BAC) in indoor environments and via the water supply. The greatest amount of uncertainty in quantitative mi crobial risk assessment is quantification of exposure (Haas et al 1999). The number of organisms to which an individual may be exposed may vary by orders of magnitude depending on the particular environment and properties of the organism. This information becomes even more important for organisms that may be released into environments where they do not occur at all or in significant numbers as to pose a risk. The goal of this effort is to determine the fate and transport of BAC in selected environments where the exposure impact may be large or complex. Two major areas are: Indoor building environments Drinking water distribution systems Because BAC agents are too hazardous to work with, in the environments we wish to study, it will be necessary to develop surrogates so th at assessments can be made under real world conditions. This project draws together seve ral groups with extensive experience in the detection, transport and fate of BAC in aerosols, water and fom ites, and transmission dynamics of Category A agents. This goal will be met thr ough a series of specific sub-project objectives. 1. Development of new BAC surrogates for application in methods assessment and transport and fate modeling efforts. 2. Validation of detection methods fo r microbial risk assessment. 3. Development of fate and transp ort models for BAC on fomites. 4. Development of fate and transport models for BAC in water systems. 5. Development and validation of a discrete- time Markov chain model for airborne BAC within a room. 6. Measure the re-suspension of particle-asso ciated BAC in a test room or chamber 7. Determine the particle size dist ribution of respiratory aerosol Objective 1. Development of new BAC surrogat es for application in methods assessment and transport and fate modeling efforts. To understand the fate and transport of BAC in the real world it will be necessary to develop and select surrogate organisms whos e properties would impart behavior in the environment similar to that of the BAC. These would include i) Surface properties (isoelectric point and hydrophobicity), ii) Environmental resistan t structures (spores, cysts), iii) Size and shape, iv) Similar nucleic acid, and v) Resist ance to desiccation and di sinfectants. Surrogate development will also be used for the assessmen t of the sensitivity of methods for the detection of BAC in real world environments. There are several types of surrogate m odels, which can be used. These include Polystyrene spheres of various sizes Viral like particles (VLP's) identical or simila r to the virus of interest. Nucleic acid of non-pathogens can be inserted into these par ticles for assessment of detection methods 24 Live vaccines Genetically related organisms Model organism (bacteriophages of simila r structure and nucl eic acid as BAC) Indigenous organism BAC or related organisms inactivated by di sinfectants that do not effect transport properties (i.e. UV light inactivated spores) The University of Arizona group has previous ly used polystyrene spheres to trace the transport of bacterial and viruses indoor and aqua tic environments (Bales et al 1997; Gerba, unpublished). Viral like particles have been de veloped for almost all of the BAC including Ebola virus, arena viruses, hantavirus virus (Table I-1 ). They have been used in several studies to assess the environmental transport of pathogen ic viruses (Cabellero et al 2004). Bovine rotavirus VLP's have been demonstrated to have the same stability as the infectious virus produced in cell culture (L oisy et al 2004) in aqua tic environments. Live vaccines are available for almost all of the bacterial ag ents of concern, and where they cannot be used, closely related organisms could be used (i.e. Bacillus cereus or B. thuringiensis spores for anthrax spores). Bacteriophages have been used in numerous studies to assess th e survival and transport of viruses in water and indoor (households and da y care centers) environments (Rheinbaben et al 2000). The movement of naturally occurring inf ections via fomites can also be assessed by routine monitoring of building fomites as the in fections spread through a community. We have been able to determine the distribution of infl uenza virus in homes and day care settings by monitoring influenza viruses on fomites by PCR (Boone and Gerba 2004). This approach helps identify those surfaces that become contaminated during the natural spread of either a respiratory or enteric organism. Table I-1 provides ex isting examples of each type of surrogate. An initial goal of the exposure group will be to evaluate potential surrogates for use as models for the various BAC agents in differe nt environments. This will be done by the University of Arizona (UA) and Northern Arizona University (NAU) groups through an assessment of safety, literature reviews, and sim ilar behavior to BAC in the same environment, and similar properties that would control survival and distribution in the environment. Selected surrogates will initially be assessed in laboratory experiments before field or large-scale use. The group at NAU will conduct laboratory experiments to compare (benchmark) the survival of B. antrhracis and B. thuringiensis to determine the latter's potential usefulness as a surrogate. The experience of the NAU group working with Yersina pestis and Francisella tularensis and other BAC will also be relied upon in th e selection of surrogates (Johan sson et al 2004; Girard et al 2004). The UA group will develop VLP for arena viru s (Category A) and Norwalk (Calicivirus) virus Category B)(Redman et al 1997). This part of the project will provide surrogates which could be available for others investig ators outside of the center activities. 25 Table I-1. Examples of surrogates for BAC Potential Surrogates Pathogen References Polystyrene Spheres Viruses, bact eria, parasites Bales et al 1997 Virus-like Particles (VLPS) Ebola virus, Hantaan virus, Semliki-forest virus Watanabe, et al 2004 Betenbaugh, et al 1995 Notka, et al 1999 Mossienko, et al 2003 Live Vaccines Yersinia pestis Francisella tularensis Coxiella burnetii Titball and Williamson, 2004 Conlan, Bacillus subtilus, B. thuringiensis B. anthracis Nicholson and Galeano, 2003 Hill et al 2004 Model Organisms Coliphage MS-2, non- lipid viruses Utrup and Frey, 2003 Indigenous Pathogens Influenza, viruses Boone and Gerba, 2004 Objective 2: Validation of detection methods for microbial risk assessment Development of tools to quantify risk requires th at we have detection methods that are able to: i) detect single cell/particle for bacteria/v iruses, ii) process large number of samples (compounded or separate) to provide data on spa tial variability and addr ess sampling limitations for the chosen method, iii) perform the tests in less than 1 hour under field conditions, although it may be longer during the develo pmental stage of the risk me thods, and iv) quantitatively incorporate the false positives and false negatives error rates. Table I-2 lists the desired range of values for these characteristics and examples of studies/devices that are currently available to achieve those. It is obvious that all of the above must be with surrogates that closely mimic the real threats with respect to parameters listed in Table I-2 but are not harmful if used for modeling release scenarios and testing detection methods (e .g., see Schaefer et al., 1999). Availability of these surrogates with fluorescent tags (e.g., see fo r viruses, Gitis et al , 2002) to improve their detection limit will also be required. Establishment of the already available high th roughput, fast, sensitive, and specific detection methods will be one of the objectives of the proj ect focusing on exposure, fate, and transport of the target surrogate agents. Th e focus of validation will be on surrogates for the Category A agents (Table E1 see Center management) so that risk from contaminated air, water, soil, and hard surfaces from indoor and/or ou tdoor environments can be quantified. From many methods reported in literature for the Category A agents, it is evident that most of the targets have a number of detection methods that can provide results within hours (som e within a few minutes, Reference from Science). Some of the methods ar e also quantitative (e.g., real time PCR using genes specific to Bacillus anthracis ) and claim to detect at the level of one cell or one spore (Ref). When using RT-PCR, it is also possible to identify methods that multiplex either dozens of genes of the same target or dozens of targets (Ref). Therefor e, development of new detection methods for the above agents will be outside th e scope of this effort. Improvements in the existing detection methods with respect to all th e five parameters listed in Table I-2 for the specific purpose of improving the quantifying the risk will, howeve r, be included in the scope. 26 Table I-2.

False positives and false negatives 1 in 10,000,000 If possible, th is should even be higher 5 Cost per sample $1-10 Many single agent tests, PCR Major gaps are in the area of how these methods are used in the field to quantify risk based on the occurrence and abundance of a target organi sm or gene. The whole system from sampling, sample processing, and detection must work togeth er to yield useful data for quantification of risk. Such systems are neither fully developed no r well tested. We will establish the baseline in terms of the number and type of samples, dete ction methods including limits of detection, the false positive and false negative e rror rates, and the actual dete ction technologies. Processing of large number of samples of different types in a multiplexed manner, quantification of abundance of a large number of target genes in each sample, and the associated magnitude of false positive and false negative error rates under field conditions will also be developed. We will also develop protocols to identify the most likely hot spots for the presence of an agent as indicated by the mode of contamination, and li kely will generate hypothetical data to develop methods for risk quantification. We will use the best available sampling and detection tools to experimentally validate the quantified risk for ea ch type of environmenta l release scenario in model systems (fomites, building, and selected animal models). The major questions related to method validation will include the following: i) What are the best available methods for each of the six Category A agents with respect to specificity, sensitivity, speed, ge netic variability, cost , sample processing, false positives, false negatives, ease of use, ability for on-the-spot analysis, etc. Can they be carried out together on-the-s pot or off-line for fast screening? ii) Are there existing methods using surrogate and/or DNA tagged nano-particles that can be used to begin the release and m odeling exercises in year 1 of the center activities. Our initial survey indicates that they do exist (Nam et al., 2003, Nam et al., 2004, Amagliani et al. 2004, Dunb ar et al. 2003, Francois et al. 2003, Gitis et al., 2002) but further improvements/changes may be necessary for our specific purpose. iii) What is the minimum number of samples (i ncluding locations) that is needed by the risk assessment tools to provide the nece ssary confidence in \"clean up operations\". What equivalent sampling locations and number of samples would have missed the detection and resulted in exposure? iv) What is the potentia l of high throughput sample proc essing approach es/units in minimizing the uncertainty associated with a limited number of samples? v) What is the impact of gene sequence based detection in evaluating risk? What methods are best suited fo r detection of viability? 27 Objective 3. Development of fate and transport models for BAC on fomites Fomite contamination is believed to play a ro le in 80% of the common infections that we experience (respiratory and gastroin testinal). Ingestion of soil (pica) or mouth contact with inanimate objects (fomites) or indirectly by cont amination of the fingers, (which are then bought to the mouth, nose or eyes) are additional r outes of transmission. The effectiveness of transmission by fomites is complex (Haas et al 1999). Resuspension of organisms from fomites will be dealt with by the University of Califor nia (UC)group in objective 6.To model this, an understanding of the number of organisms transfe rred during each step is necessary, as well as, the survival of the organisms on the surfaces. Survival and transport depend upon a number of factors including i) Humidity, ii ) Suspending media, iii) Type of organism, iv) Temperature, v) Type of surface, and vi) Moisture on the surface. The area most lacking information is on the de gree of transfer from hands to mouth, nose, eyes, other fomites, and foods. The UA group has previously conducted limited study on the transfer efficiency of surrogate bacteriophage and bacteria fr om fomites-to-hand-to-lips of human subjects for the use in risk models (Rusin et al 2002). To better deve lop quantita tive data we propose to Use surrogates to assess transfer rates fo r hands for items which may be involved in bioterrorist acts i.e. envelopes, pr oduce, office items, etc (UA group) Study the transfer of viral like particles and s pores that resemble the surface properties of BAC from surfaces-to-hand-to-lips or food items (UA group) Study the dispersion of surrogates in different ty pes of working environments i.e. offices, warehouse, package handling facility. Surrogates similar to those previo usly used in child day care centers will be used (Rhein baben et al 2000). UA and UC groups. The qualitative information developed in these st udies can used in risk models to assess exposure of BAC in different indoor environments. Objective 4: Development of fate and tran sport models for BAC in water systems. The primary goal of this work is to experimentally dete rmine quantitative exposure if a BAC is released into a drinking water in a wate r distribution system. Th e release of BAC into drinking water or irrigation wa ter used for crop production or can have a far-reaching impact on the environment (Morris et al 1998; Luthy 2002; Deininger et al 2000; Decker 1990),. For example, release of BAC into the drinking wate r distribution system will not only effect the drinking water, but potential indoor air, food, a nd surface (fomite) contamination (Figure I-1). Contaminated buildings, sewer systems, sewage discharge areas, and biosolids produced from sewage would all pose infection disease risk s (Hoglund et al 1998; Mail and Asmad 2002). The University of Arizona is currently construc ting a drinking water distribution system to a group of four existing dwellings, which will serv e to assess the detection and fate of BAC and chemical agents in distribution systems. It is being constructed with funding from Tucson Water (the utility which serves Tucson) the Nationa l Science Foundation Water Quality Center, and The University of Arizona to serve as a model community for the testing and evaluation of real time monitoring of intentional chem ical and biological intrusions. The \"Water Village\" as it will be called will provide the ability to assess the dispersion of BAC in the distribution system and within buildings. It will also aid in determining the assessment of clean-up methods (i.e. 28 disinfectants). The distribution system will contain sensors for water quality (pH, temperature, dissolved solids, etc) throughout the network for continuous monitoring. It will also be possible to change the water at various poi nts in the distribution system a nd remove sections of piping for testing and observation. Water use in the homes (kitchen tap, showers) will mimic that in an actual family. It will also be possible to do aero sol release in these homes to assess dispersion and potential success of clean-up efforts.

Potential environmental impacts from release of a BAC in drinking water distribution systems It is proposed that surrogate viruses and bacteria be released into the distribution system to assess dispersion, persisten ce, and distribution of surrogates. This would be followed over time and decontamination success and impact on risk reduction can be evaluated. Artificial Neural Network models will be used to assess the data for incorporation of risk assessment models. Application of Artificial Neural Networks . A model based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) will be developed and tested (i) to forecast microbial dispersion patterns in each system, (ii) to estimate dispersion time, and (iii) to recommend detection methods, sampling frequencies, and sampling locations . Prediction modeling through comp utational tools for irriga tion water channels, drink water systems and sewer are currently underway at the University of Arizona. Based on a series of field experiments, the qualifie d computational model can provide us an impetus to establish an optimization technique in a systematic manner. Th e spread patterns of biological agents can be predicted by computational methods upon experime ntal verification. Numerical data sets can serve as a database for microbial risk assessment. We propose to use the ANN as a flexible ma thematical structure that is capable of learning complex systems with approximating mu ltiple input and output responses. Simulations of the transport and dispersion of chemical tracers and microbial contaminants have been successfully carried out using ANNs in recent y ears. Our goal is to pr oduce a 'well-trained' neural network to predict the release point and re lease time of contaminants by tracing back their detection data at monitoring points. 29 We will evaluate the limitations and uncertain ties characteristic of special and temporal sampling and detection methods used to measur e microbial occurrence in the environment. We also would like to develop models that can be used to rapidly assess the risk based on detected biological agents introduced at differe nt points in various en vironments (buildings, agricultural lands, food chains, and water distribution system s). The goal of this task is to provide decision-makers a simple tool to assess the impact of BAC. Experimental approach. The major goal of ANN in th is study is to predict the spatial and temporal identification of microorganism release in pressurized water systems and prediction of e nvironmental dispersion using a concept of a pattern classification. To accomplish these, water quality parameters such as pH, temperature, alkalinity, turbidity, chlorine concentr ation, conductivity, a nd dissolved oxygen considered as key parameters. The ANN-base d model will be used as the base of knowledge on the viability and in fectivity potential of pathog ens in water, identify and prioritize the key gaps, formulate a comprehensive approach for filling those gaps. Artificial neural networks use a modeling philos ophy that is similar to that of statistically based approaches, using historical data sets to approximate the relationship between inputs and corresponding output variables. A ne ural network consists of a sy stem of interconnected nodes. The first layer of nodes (the input layer) brings th e information to be proc essed into the network. Nodes in subsequent layers ar e called neurons, as they perf orm neuron-like functions. Each neuron consists of two parts, a linear summation function ( ) and a linear or nonlinear activation function ( f). While many different types of neural networ ks have been developed, a back-propagation design will be chosen for the proposed research because of its demonstrated effectiveness at classifying nonlinear data sets. The simulated obs ervations with computational simulation tools validated by experimental data will be used to train the ANNs. The st andard back-propagation network has three types: input, hidden and output neurons. Input neurons send the initial data to layers of processing (hidden) neurons. Output neurons accept input fro m the hidden layer and provide the network's report to the user as a list of probabilities. A set of input-output responses representing a variety of simulation scenarios is sampled at random, and a simple technique to allocate th is set into training and testing subsets is developed. Training procedures consist of two ph ases, a training (accuracy or calibration) phase and a testing (generalization or validation) phase. In the ANN's trai ning phase, the objective is to determine the weights that minimize a specific e rror criterion defined to measure an average difference between the desired responses and the ANN' s responses to the patterns. The success of the training strongly depends on the normalization of the data and on the choice of the training parameters, namely the learning and momentum coefficients (Demuth and Beale 1998; Water Science Technology Library 2000). The networks' generalization properties can be exploite d for the identification of parameters values associated to new simulated concentration histories. After training has been completed, the ANN's generalization properties w ill be used for various applications. For instance, the ANN can be used to identify th e location where unknown biological agents are released with simulated concentration histories (P ark et al 2003; Schleiter et al 1999; Yabunaka et al 1997; Maier et al 1998).. Shortly after a purposeful contamination even t, the off-line monitoring equipment will detect significant changes from the baseline in time-series of concentration of E. coli , 30 conductivity, pH, and/or tu rbidity - or more likely, one or mo re of these parameters. The ANN will interpret early-detected time-series data and predict the following pattern of water quality parameters. At the same time, the ANN will calcula te characteristics and statistical variables, which can present a certain pattern which will be used to identify the contaminant source. Possible Outcomes. Physical, hydraulic and biological characteristics in hypothetical conditions will be used for the ANNs' traini ng. In all cases, the ANNs' approach will demonstrate the ability to identify the unknown parameters in the models that leads to concentration histories that are very similar to the computed values by the water quality model. On this basis, the ANNs will be able to trace ba ck the concentration of hypothesized biological agents and will provide an approximate range for th e releasing site, which is the pollutant source. The ANNs' results will be identified through recalcul ation by the water quali ty model. Statistical analysis tools will evaluate their performance. A measure of the interdependence between th e measured data and the model will be assessed through statistical analysis; for example, the sum square error (SSE), correlation coefficient (R2), root mean s quare error (RMSE) and mean e rror (ME). In addition, several additional variables will be presented for clear comparison: breakthrough tim e (travel time), peak concentration and peak detection time. Knowledge of source areas can lead to the installation of typical security apparatuses (e.g., fences) and/or atypical secu rity measures (e.g., armed security guards) that are most likely to be applied at large water supply systems. Unfo rtunately, it appears that much of the country is of the misconception that only very large water- supply systems are threatened and, furthermore, only at the downstream outflow points beyond the wa ter treatment system. While this situation certainly is worthy of concern, it is not the only case that should merit our attention. By conducting basic model simulation studies, wa ter managers can also develop standard risk assessments for biological a ttacks on their drinking water supplie s. By developing basic risk assessments, site managers can gain a general sense of how vulnerable their respective water supplies are to various toxic contaminants and release amounts. A vulnerability assessment can then be used to develop human health protection- strategies (e.g., \"boil wate r\" or \"do not drink\" health advisories) for use in th e event of a terrorist attack. We expect the proposed study can be critical to advance the assessment of fate and transport, outline numerical tools to represent th eir patterns, and improve the current surveillance system by integrating experiment al and numerical approaches. Objective 5: Development and validation of a discrete-time Markov Chain Model for airborne particle fate-a nd-transport within a room This component has three aims. (1) Deve lop and experimentally validate a simple discrete-time Markov chain model (termed Leve l I) for the fate-and-transport of particles released into air. (2) Demonstr ate a method for translating the velocity vector and turbulent diffusivity field outputs of com putational fluid dynamics modeling into transition probabilities for a more complex Markov chain model (termed Level II). (3) Test th e performance of the Level I Markov chain model against the perfor mance of the Level II model in simulating exposure intensity to airborne pa rticle-associated BAC. Comb ined with information on the infectious dose-response model (Haas, et al., 1999) and on the pathogen emission rate (for example, Nicas, Nazaroff and Hubbard, 2004) th e resulting exposure model would permit estimating infection risk and intervention efficacy for different BAC in a variety of scenarios 31 (Nicas and Hubbard, 2002). For example, one c ould assess a health car e worker's risk of secondary infection by Y. pestis bacilli (pneumonic plague) or va riola virus (smallpox) emitted in respiratory aerosol from infec tious patients; for these two BAC, infection can occur due to deposition of pathogens in either the upper resp iratory tract or the pulmonary region (Meyer, 1961; Nicas, Hubbard, et al., 2004). Overall, the validated model w ould offer a relatively simple and intuitive approach to estimating spatially specific concentrations of airborne particle-associated BAC in indoor environments, and predicting the locations and amounts (e.g., hot spots) of surface contamination w ith BAC following a release of BAC into room air. This phase of the project will be conducted at the University of Calidornia. Previous Work: Current models predicting exposure to airborne contaminants focus on gas-phase substances or small part icles with negligible settling ve locities. We have developed a simple (Level I) Markov chain model that describes the fate-and-transport within a room of mixtures of particles with diffe rent aerodynamic diameters released into air, as would pertain in many particle exposure scenarios (Nicas and Nazaroff, 2004). Particles are dispersed by turbulent eddy diffusion (assumed constant th roughout the room) and by advective airflow (assumed uniform in one direction), and are rem oved from room air by gravitational settling, by exhaust ventilation (mechanical and exfiltration), and to a small degree by deposition onto walls. Each mechanism is assigned a first-order rate constant, where the cons tants for gravitational settling and wall deposition depend on the particle aerodynamic diameter. Room air is divided into cubic cells. An interior room air cell is bordered by six neighboring cells, two each along the x-, y-, and z-axis, resp ectively. For a time step t on the order of 10 3 min, a particle in a room air cell is assigned a probability of remaini ng in that same cell or moving to one of the six neighboring cells, where the probab ilities depend on the first-order ra te constants. The set of probabilities are entered in a square matrix P; each room air cell is represented by a row and column in the matrix. Settling, deposition and exhaust removal are also represented in the P matrix. The probability that a particle starting in cell i at reference time zero is in cell j at future time n \u00d7 t is found by multiplying P by itself n times, or Pn; the desired probability is the entry in the ith row and jth column of Pn. The model predicts the change in the size distribution and mass concentration of the aerosol as particles disperse away from the releas e point. The model also predicts the pattern of settling and surface deposition of different sized particles within a room. One of us has published details of a similar Markov chain mode l for gas-phase contaminants (Nicas, 2001) The difference here is that par ticles have additional first-order loss rates involving gravitational settling and deposition onto surfaces, and considerati on is given to a mixture of different particle sizes. Aim 1 Our goal is to modify the Level I mode l to account for a thermal plume around the body and for objects within the room, and to test model predictions by direct experimentation. Experimental Approach. At UC-Berkeley, initial experi ments would be conducted using a chamber fabricated for this study, with dime nsions chosen to permit examining particle behavior in a small-scaled room and to accomm odate aerosol generation and sampling devices. Several ventilation configurations would be used. An aerosol gene rator would be located in the chamber, although particles could also be released into the supply air stream. We would initially use liquid ammonium fluorescein pa rticles via a procedure previously described (Thatcher, et al., 1996), although later experiments would use solid polystyrene spheres or surrogate BAC particles developed at the Univer sity of Arizona, Northern Ar izona University and Michigan 32 State University. We would generate monodisper se aerosols of different aerodynamic diameters. For each particle size, there would be different combinations of factors involving the number of chamber air changes per hour, the chamber vent ilation configuration, and the presence or absence of a heating lamp to mimic the body's upward thermal plume. An experimental run would consist of the continuous emission of particles for a pre- determined length of time, T 1. Air sampling at the different chamber lo cations would be performed up to T 1 and would cease once particle release ceases. The chamber air exhaust supply would continue operating up to subsequent time T 2 at which point the experimental run would be terminated. The air filter samples and the chamber surface filter samples would be collected and analyzed for fluorescein. For the same set of room conditions and particle sizes, the Markov chain model would be used to predict the particle mass collect ed on the samples, such that th e accuracy of model predictions could be evaluated over a range of particle s sizes and room vent ilation conditions. Aim 2 Traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of indoor air flow produces a velocity vector field and a turbulent diffusivity field as outputs. CFD is considered the most accurate modeling method to predict air gas-phase contaminant concentrations at different room positions. Our aim is to tran slate CFD output into a series of transition probabilities for a discrete-time Markov chain mode l, and thereby create a Level II model to predict the fate-and-transport of particle-associated BAC within a room. Th e general approach is described below given the simplifying context of a Cartesian coordinate system and a CFD grid consisting of cubic cells with neighboring cells adjoining surface-to-surface, that is, the surfaces of two neighboring cells abut each other completely. Experimental Approach For a given node (cell), a ssume the velocity vector v is located at the cell origin with magnitude v (m min1) and direction angles X, Y and Z along the x- axis, the y-axis and z-axis, respectively. The velocity component along the x-axis is (v\u00d7cosX)i, where i is the unit vector along the x-axis in the positive direction. The velocity components along the y-axis and z-axis are computed in an analogous fashion. The air speed (m min1) in each orthogonal direction is the value of the coefficient which multiplies the unit vector. Consider that a cubi c cell with velocity vector v has length aspect L (m), such that a cell face has surface area L2 (m2) and the cell has volume L3 (m3). Consider that ( v\u00d7cosX)i is directed to the neighboring cell to the right. The air flowrate (m3 min1) from the cell to the neighboring cell on the right is v \u00d7 cosX \u00d7 L2. The corresponding first- order rate constant for a particle leaving th e cell to the neighboring cell on the right due to this advective ai r flow is: X There is an analogous first-order rate constant for a particle leaving the cell due to advectiv e flow to the neighbor ing cell in front (or back) and the neighboring ce ll above (or below). The conversion of the eddy diffusivity coefficient D (m2 min1) for each cell (node) into a first-order rate constant would follow the method used for the Level I model (Nicas and Nazaroff, 2004). Where D (min1) denotes the rate constant for a particle leaving a cell due to turbulent eddy diffusion: D = (6 D) \u00f7 L2. The first-order rate at which a particle is carried to a given neighboring cell (say, the cell on th e right) by turbulent eddy diffusion is 1/6 \u00d7 D. Integration of the CFD and Markov chain m odeling approaches woul d be a collaborative effort among the group at UC-Berkeley and Dr. Ch arles Haas at Drexel University. Dr. Haas conducts research using CFD techniques, and woul d generate room air velocity and turbulent diffusivity fields for scenarios of interest. 33 Aim 3 The performance of the Level I Markov chain model would be tested against the Level II model as a means to explore exposure intens ity of building occupants to airborne BAC. An important practical question in developing and applying inha lation exposure models to BAC is the extent to which detailed knowledge of the airflow conditions in any particular space is essential for understa nding exposure. When considering different levels of detail in the treatment, at one end of the spectrum is the well-mixed model construct, which treats th e particle concentration as uniform throughout the room, and at the other end is CFD, which predicts the spatial di stribution of particle concentrations. The well-mixed co nstruct is mathematically si mple, but cannot describe the observation that exposure intensity increases with proximity to th e emission source. The detail provided by CFD captures spatial variability in exposur e intensity, but at a steep computational cost; further, exact prediction of particle exposur e is beyond the current state-of-the-art in airflow simulation. What is not yet clear is how detailed a description mu st be produced for a microbial risk assessment. Interest in practical applicat ion of exposure modeling tools argues for careful exploration of the modeling domain between th e well-mixed representation, and models based on the fully space-and-time resolved air velocity fields. Experimental Approach At UC-Berkeley, we would unde rtake several case studies in which we would simulate exposure intensity fiel ds using the Markov ch ain model, but with different levels of detail in the treatment of the air flow field. Either from the literature and/or in collaboration with Dr. Haas at Drexel Univer sity, the group at UC-Berkeley would obtain a detailed airflow simulation of a realistic indoor space. We anticipate that the simulation would employ CFD, probably based on th e well-established k-epsilon m odel of turbulent flow. We would run Level II simulations of the Markov chai n model using these airflow fields as input. We would also run Level I simulations using simp ler representations of the airflow conditions. We would explore how the propert ies of the exposure intensity field vary between these two types of simulations. Objective 6: Measure the resuspension of pa rticle-associated BAC in a test room or chamber The aim is to assess the potential for resuspendi ng into room air particle-associated BAC which are present on room surfaces. The particles to which BAC are att ached are traditionally termed fomites. Given that the pathogen remains viable on surfaces for a sufficient duration, resuspension can lead to inhalation infection of room occupants in the absence of an active BAC release source such as an aerosol generating device or an infectious individual. Resuspension of settled anthrax spores was documented in the Hart Senate Office building bi oterrorist attack of Fall 2001. Experimental Approach. At UC-Berkeley, experiments w ould initially be conducted using fluorescein-labeled particles. Several particle matrices would be examined, for example, an artificial respiratory fluid (as a surrogate for pathogens in respiratory fluid particles expelled by individuals with respiratory tr act infections), tap water (as a surrogate for pathogens that can be aerosolized from tap water), soil (as a surroga te for pathogens carried by soil particles due to ambient release of the pathogen) and fibers (as a surrogate for pathogens carried on fibers that are shed from contaminated clothing). The partic les would be released as aerosol inside a test chamber to attain a fairly uniform deposition over the floor; the amount of fluorescein deposited would be assayed from samples of collection medi a on the chamber floor (a nd on wall surfaces). Next, air movement inside the chamber would be induced using one or more fans, and perhaps 34 by moving an object inside the chamber. Air sa mpling would be conducted at locations inside the chamber during different peri ods of the duration of air moti on. Exhaust air from the chamber would be passed through a separate filter to collect resuspended particles not collected by the within-chamber air samples. Once the induced air motion is terminated, samples of collection media on the floor (and walls) would be analyzed for fluorescein mass. In theory, the estimated fluorescein mass originally deposited on the cham ber surfaces (denoted mass Dep) should equal the fluorescein mass collected on the within-chamber and exhaust air samples (denoted collectively as mass Air) plus the flourescein mass remaining on chambe r surfaces (denoted mass Rem), or Dep = Air + Rem. The estimated percent of particle mass resuspended is (Air \u00f7 Dep) \u00d7 100%. We would investigate the influence of several factors, which are expected a priori to affect the extent of particle resuspension. These factors include the type of surface (e.g., cement, stainless steel, linoleum, wood, carpet), the size of the partic les deposited, the electrostatic charge on the particles, the absolute humidity of the air, and the intensity of air motion. The results with fluorescein-labeled particles woul d be confirmed with surrogate BAC particles developed at the University of Arizona, Nort hern Arizona University, and Michigan State University. Objective 7: Determine the Particle Si ze Distribution of Respiratory Aerosol A major threat of BAC is posed by secondary inf ections in which diseased individuals become vectors for infecting others. The size and number of respiratory particles emitted by human subjects during ordinary activities is a key aspect affecting the pr obability of secondary infection. As reviewed in a recent paper (Nicas, Nazar off and Hubbard, 2004), only a few experiments have been conducted to measure th e size distribution of respirat ory particle emissions, and the results from these experiments are not consistent with one another. Additional experimental work is needed to measure the size distributi on of human respiratory particle emissions. Experimental Approach At UC-Berkeley, we w ould conduct laboratory-based experiments to measure the respiratory drop let size distribution emitted both from healthy subjects and from those with re spiratory infection. The first pha se of this project would be method development and testing. The second phase would involve applying the method to collect data from several subjec ts in different emission modes. Two promising measurement approaches are available. In the first approach, we envision that a test subject would be placed in a small te st room supplied with pa rticle-free air (achieved by means of HEPA filtration). The subject would w ear low-particle clothing, such as is used in semiconductor manufacturing. We envision that the subject's expelled respiratory aerosol would enter a room air stream flowing at a known volumetric rate in uniform fashion through a cylindrical structure; the intent of the structure is to contain the aerosol and present it to one or more sampling devices. An aerodynamic particle sizer is capable of measuring size-resolved particle number concentrations over the range 0.5-10 \u00b5m in diameter would be positioned in the air stream a short distance downs tream from the entry point of the aerosol. Emission events would be triggered, and the number of particle s emitted and their size distribution would be inferred from the sampling data for each event. In the second approach, a small quantity of a safe but easily measured dye would be introdu ced into the subject's mouth; a similar dye technique was utilized in two early studies of the size distribution of re spiratory aerosol (Duguid, 1946; Louden and Roberts, 1967) The emissions prot ocol would be similar to that used in the first procedure. Sampling would be done us ing a cascade impactor, and the amount of dye deposited on each stage would be related to emissions of particles in that particular size range. 35 We propose to make measurements using six subject s initially - three hea lthy subjects and three subjects with respiratory inf ection. The modes of emission to be studied would include coughing, sneezing, and talking. Project Management Dr. Gerba will be the lead investigator for this project. He will coordinate the efforts between the groups in volved in the exposure assessment. He will also ensure that the data produced is in a format that can be used by the other projects on-going in the center (risk assessment modeling). UA (Gerba ) and NAU (Keim) will be responsible for surrogate development and assessment. The UA team will include Dr. Gerba Dr Choi and Dr. Ian Pepper, as a co-investigator (UA) and they will also be responsible for fate and transport by fomites and water systems, with in-put from th e NAU group.

The MSU team (Dr. Hashsham and Dr . Rose) will lead the efforts on the detection systems with input from UA and NAU. Facilities University of Arizona has 2,500 sq. ft. of laboratory space with areas for bacteriological, virological, and pa rasite analyses of water, soil, food and fomites, meeting all BL-2 standards for pathogens, cell culture and molecular biology.

It will contain sensors for water quality (pH, temperature, diss olved solids, etc) thr oughout the network for continuous monitoring. It will al so be possible to change the water at various points in the distribution system and remove se lection of piping for testing and observation. Water use in the homes (kitchen tap, showers) will mimic that in actual family of four homes. It will also be possible to do aerosol release in these homes to assess dispersi on and potential success of clean- up efforts. Michigan State University.

Infectious Disease Models for Assessing Microbial Risks and Developing Control Strategies Objectives Microbial risk for transmissible infectio ns has distinct indi vidual and population components. The release of pathogens into th e environment may have higher or lower direct effects on individuals exposed to the contaminated environment depending upon how much transmission is occurring via other routes and stimulating immunity. Pathogens in the environment also may have higher or lower indi rect effects depending on whether the secondary cases transmitted from the index cases generate su stained chains of transmission. Standard risk model estimates are obtained by only considering the di rect risks. If an analysis of transmission through the population is not part of the risk a ssessment, no generalizable conclusions regarding risk can be made from a direct effect estimate. Accounting for the changing levels of direct and indirect risks requires inform ation at the population level on who is infectious, who is susceptible, and who is immune. This changes ov er time and will depend on a number of factors including levels of environmenta l contamination and patterns of contact between individuals and between individuals and the environment. Thus predictions regarding such changes are a crucial element of microbial risk assessment for transmissibl e infections that are not at all a part of risk assessment for non-transmissible infections. To accu rately characterize micr obial risk, therefore, requires a model that: 1) is dynamic, nonlinear, can account for the heterogeneous nature of the disease process within indivi duals as well as heterogeneous patterns of contact between individuals; 2) encompasses both human and envi ronmental contributions to transmission; 3) integrates control potential and control resource li mitations into the assessment of risk; and 4) can be used to assess the validity of inferences regarding the consequenc es of bioterrorist and infection control actions. Sp ecifically, we propose to develo p a methodology that provides explicit links between the models of environmental exposure and m odels of the disease process, focusing on how heterogeneity will impact risk. This methodology will be used to integrate environmental and dose-response data and to aid in : a) early detection of outbreaks; b) planning for both short- and long-term control effo rts, and c) setting research agendas. A bioterrorist incident, as with all outbreaks, is highly dynamic. There are many temporal aspects of an outbreak that make it dynamic. First, a point-source exposure in a bioterrorist incident will gene rate cases that occur over time. Second, exposure conditions may change over this same time period altering the ri sk from future exposure events. And third, for transmissible pathogens, individuals infected from the initial point-source attack will put others at risk. Transmission models have been used extensively to examine many infectious disease processes. There has been much less work in developing transmission models that explicitly model the environmental processes of pathogens, an critical component of risk assessment. An exception to this is in the area of water quality where water quality measurements have been integrated into transmission models to estimate ri sk (Chick et al. 2002, Eise nberg et al. In press, Soller et al. 2003). An important component of this research will be to develop appropriate infection models that can address both large and small scale outbreaks, that can estimate both immediate point source risks as well as longer term risk conditions due to the spread of infection, and that can examine pathogens that can be transmitte d via surfaces, hands, air, food, and water. As with all disease processes, the patterns of disease will be heterogeneous in space and time. The incorporation of this heterogeneity is important for any adequate estimation of risk but 41 it is especially important for transmissible inf ections where different c ontact patterns between population segments with different individual risk s can dramatically change both the direct and indirect effects from an environmental expos ure. There are a nu mber of sources of heterogeneity. Some sources are clearly associat ed with heterogeneity in exposure. However others are functions of heterogeneity amongst th e individuals or within the population that is exposed. Another important component of this research, therefore, will be to use our methodology and risk models to ascertain the impact of different sources of heterogeneity on risk as well as the impact of contact patterns. Some of these sources are focused at individual-level dose response relationships such as : variability in the intrinsic infectivity and virulence of the infectious agents (including poten tial alterations from \"weaponizati on\" of organisms of concern); or variability in the response of individuals to the infectious agent (and modification by intrinsic extrinsic factors influencing susceptibility); and differences in severity and duration of outcomes resulting from exposure. Other sources are focuse d at the population level such as: differences in susceptibility to the bioterrorist agent due to different contact patterns that have circulated infection and thus stimulated immunity differently; differences in exposure to infected individuals in the contagious st ate (presence of \"super-spreaders\" or failures of quarantine or containment); differences in environmental exposures. It is generally envisioned that bioterrorist attacks will occur through the environment. Risk assessment models, therefore, must have an explicit description of the exposure pathways that are relevant for bio-terrori st activities. The release of a pathogen can occur via different media, such as: water, through post-treatment contamination; food through manufacturing or farm contamination; air through aer osol release or circulating inf ectious individuals , and surfaces that might be contaminated in a variety of wa ys including mailed lett ers as occurred with anthrax. The value of environmental measurements of microbial contamination is not just with regard to measurement of origin al sources of agent from a biot errorist. Secondary transmission from human to human can also oc cur via surfaces, air, water, food and in addition via hands. Measurements of microbial environmental contam ination have not as yet been used to help model the spread of infection through populat ions. We will devise methods where such measurements contribute to unde rstanding how the transmission system works and what actions will best bring transmission under control. To create exposure sub-processes within ri sk assessment models requires specific information on the fate and transport of micr oorganisms. Although exposure assessment is a central part of microbial risk assessments for food and water, there has been less work linking comprehensive exposure models with transmission models. To be relevant for examining risks associated with bioterrorist events, microbial risk assessment needs to be generalized to a broader set of exposure/disease scen arios. To this end we plan to develop important linkages to the exposure research group in our Center. Spec ifically, the risk assessment methodology will be used to help design the most effective environm ental sampling strategies, including surface, air, human hand, water, and food. It is not obvious whether very frequent measurements at a small number of places will contribute more to cont rolling transmission risk than less frequent measurements at more spots. Or whether using environmental monitoring techniques that have a lower detection level but can only be used at fe wer sites, due to higher costs per sample, would provide better information for the risk estimat es, than less costly techniques (with higher detection levels) that can be used to produce more sample points. These different strategies may require different technologies. By defining what strategies contribu te most to infection control, 42 we will help set research and development priorities for developing technology needed for the most effective strategies. Based on the importance of viewing risk to bio-terrorist attacks as a dynamic, heterogeneous, and environmentally mediated process, we propose the following specific objectives: To develop appropriate transmission models that are dynamic and provide spatially explicit details of infecti on spread through populations. Specifically, the models will allow for individuals to spend different amounts of time at different places, to contaminate the environment and in turn to acquire infect ion from the environment. This development process will involve construction and analys es of complementary deterministic and stochastic models of infection transmissi on where the media by which infection reaches from one person to another is explicitly modeled. To use existing data sets to identify pa rameters of interest including secondary transmission rates, contact patterns, and dos e response functions. To this end, outbreak data and other epidemiological studies will be used to identify parameters associated with the infection process while environmental micr obiology data will be used to identify the fate and transport processes. Heterogeneous factors will be characterized. To use the models developed in the previous objectives to anal yze different outbreak scenarios associated with local contamination, and to examine the efficacy of local control actions at different environmental points or within different population groups. And to use these models as a testbed for devel oping and evaluating sampling and analysis methods that can be used under the emerge ncy conditions of a bioterrorist related outbreak, as a guide for resource allocation in the face of uncertainties related to the natural history and transmissibility of infection and persistence of the agent in the environment. We plan to look at a variety of pathogens that are on the Class A and B lists of bioterrorist agents and are tr ansmissible from human to huma n. Specifically, we propose to examine a group of pathogens, such as small pox and noroviruses for which a reasonable amount of data exists, as well as a group of pathogens, su ch as Ebola, in which few data exist. In addition, we propose to examine other pathogens such as influenza (which is on the class C list) and SARS as surrogates. The SA RS coronavirus is has characteri stics of an ideal bioterrorist agent. It has proven its ability to generate pa nic, dramatically drain resources, and disrupt economic activity in diverse modern societies. It has a basic reproduction nu mber similar to that of smallpox but its shorter incubation period and consequent lack of potential for post-exposure vaccination make it less controllable. Approach Developing Transmission Models We will construct models of transmission through water and through droplet spread involving direct contact, fomites, and surfaces at environmental sites. These models will include descriptions of the pathogen fate and transport processes within the envi ronment. The goal of this modeling process is to obtain a balance such that models have sufficient detail to capture the complexity of the fate and transport processes as well as sufficient detail to evaluate the robustness of model based inferences to unknown aspects of those details , without being overly 43 computationally intensive or difficult to interpret. The level of detail in a model largely depends on the types of control measures that are being considered. To examine the effect of decontamination at a particular site, for exam ple, one needs to unders tand not only the patterns of contact with that environmental site but al so the patterns of contact among people. Rather than seek a generally utilizable model for any purpose, we will develop a flexible hierarchy of models that can be adapted to work in concert to address specif ic questions. In their simpler forms these models will provide general insights as to how to prepare for bioterrorist incidents and in their more realistic forms will be modifiable to address specific scenarios before or during an emergency. By constructing a hi erarchy of models, we will improve both the theoretical basis for model constr uction and analysis and the modeli ng tools to apply that theory under emergency conditions. General aspects of model analysis This proposal benefits from compliment ary approaches pursued by Koopman and Eisenberg. Both will focus on infections spread via the environment and the role of different strategies in controlling a bioterrorist init iated epidemic. Koopman's work will focus on environmental aspects of droplet and airborne spread infection a nd the role of decontamination or establishing barriers to environmental exposures, while Eisenberg's work will focus on environmental aspects of waterborne transmission and the role of water-based control strategies. One important focus of this work will be to pursue robust assessment that improves inferences about needed control actions by assessing how assu mptions about the transmission system affect those inferences. There are always unknown asp ects of the transmission system about which one needs to make control inferences. Our strate gy is to formulate models with parameters expressing those assumptions rather than bury those parameters with inappropriate model simplifications whenever we judge that unknow n aspects of the transmission system might influence the inferences we need to make. An example of the type of robustness assessment to be pursued is an analysis of control measure effects in the Beijing SARS epidemic, which we have just submitted for review. In this study we examined the benefits of contact tracing in the control of the epidemic. This robust assessment t echnique is described in more detail in Section 2.2. Another result of our analys is was the demonstration of how important measurements of exposure behavior in the general population are for making inferences about the effectiveness of control efforts. This finding should stimulate the establishment of su rveillance systems that involve collecting routin ely tabulated data on activities th at increase contact among individuals, such as attendance figures at public events or sales figures that refl ect public exposure during shopping. For decisions about decontamination, the work to be performed under this grant would highlight what type of data would impr ove the robustness of decisions about when and where to decontaminate. We will also focus on attaining inferen ce on control action based on known processes that are highly uncertain. An example of this ty pe of assessment is illustrated in previous work by Eisenberg et al, in which they examined op timal control strategies for recreational water exposure (Eisenberg et al. 2002, Eise nberg et al. 1996). An analysis of the risks associated with swimming suggested that the optimal decision gi ven the choice between localized control by limiting swimming exposure and a more centraliz ed control of improving water treatment depended heavily on the rate at wh ich infected swimmers shed pathogens into the water. The analysis further stipulated to what degree this rate need to be identified in order to attain a given level of confidence in the decision of one control option over the other. 44 To attain these goals, we will relate standa rd deterministic compartmental models that assume instantaneous contacts with instan taneously thorough mixi ng after contact to deterministic models that specify media contamin ation, agent survival an d transport in media, and media uptake. We will in turn relate these to stochastic compartmental models that do not make the assumptions of infinite population divisibi lity in each compartment. These in turn will be related to stochastic indivi dual event history models that follow individuals rather than compartment totals and thus provi de for greater degrees of heter ogeneity. Our overall goal in the model development phase will be to relate models of differing form that make different assumptions as well as models of similar form th at specify different leve ls of realistic details affecting risk. A rationale and framework for such model interdigitat ion has been presented elsewhere (Koopman 2004, Koopman et al. 2001). Relating models of different form and degrees of complexity serves two purposes. First, it facilitates robustness a ssessment. Second, it facilitates mode l fitting to infection outcome and environmental contamination patterns. As an example of using multiple models, consider the problem of deciding on key environmental transmi ssion sites for droplet spread infections like SARS where decontamination actions might be jus tified. As an initial step, deterministic model analysis can be used to gain insights into the ro les that different sites play in the transmission system, which may narrow down a decision to dec ontaminate. One must be aware, however, that those insights may not be r obust to realistic viola tion of the infinitely divisible population assumptions of deterministic models. If one is familiar with the expected effects of a transition from deterministic to stochastic models, one ca n better use the deterministic models as a first step in an analysis that narrows down a decision to decontaminate. Then one can see whether the effects of such decontamination change enough given the transition from deterministic to stochastic models so that the decision to dec ontaminate is changed. As a second step a more detailed issue may be to decide whether to c hoose localities where envi ronmental contamination exposes large numbers of individuals or to focu s control on different s ites that might act to disseminate infection to other site s. For this step a stochastic model becomes essential because deterministic models miss important aspects of the infection dissemination that are captured by stochastic models (Koopman et al. 2002). Integrating transmission models with environmental models One major strategy in our model construction will be to designate different environmental sites where transmission can take place. This serves two major purposes. First, it establishes the contact patterns that circulate infectious agents in the population and stimulate immunity. Second, it provides specific human environment interaction sites or environmental agent transport sites where the environmental models can be integrated into the population transmission models and where environmental measurements of agent levels can serve to inform model conformation and parameter estimates. For any particular mode of transmission we will model the media, such as air, water, surfaces, etc that either bioterrorists or in fected individuals might contaminate. The contamination of the media, the agent survival an d transport in the media, and the uptake of the agent are all parts of the model. Parameters sp ecific to contamination and uptake processes must S(t) Susce ptible Media (Fate and Transport process ) I(t) Infectious R(t) Immune45 be specified in exposure models. The simplest m odel form possible is illustrated in the adjacent compartmental model figure. This model tracks th e number of individuals in different disease states. Specifically, there are three disease states: S, represent those who are susceptible to disease; I, represent those who are infectious; and R, represent those who are non-infectious and protected from becoming reinfected. In addition there is at least one state that accounts for the concentration of pathogens in the environmenta l media. The thick so lid lines represent the movement of individuals from one disease state to another. The thick dashed lines represent movement of living pathogens into and out of the media. The th in lines represent influences on these flows. The more infectious individuals there are, the higher will be the flow of agents into the media and the more media contamination with live agents, the higher will be the flow from susceptible to infected individuals. In this sket ch all details of the natu ral history of infection and of agent survival or transport are ignored. The models we will develop will include details that specify living and n on-living agents in the media. Meas urement of non-living agents can be just as or more helpful in assessing venue specific contamination rates from infectious individuals as measurements of live agents. On ly living agents affect infection risk. Thus measurements of both live and dead organisms in the environment will help specify the models but both might not be needed, depending on th e results of robustness assessment for the particular decisions being addressed. Note that compartmental models that incor porate the transmission media do relax several unrealistic assumptions of standard compartmental models of infection; e.g., they do not assume that contact is symmetric but rather allow for di rectional transmission from someone who is first at a site to someone who comes later. Simila rly, they do not assume that contact is an instantaneous process of individu als bumping into each other but ra ther incorporate the time that an individual is at a site deposit ing and or acquiring agent from the media. This formulation also replaces the standard assumpti on of thorough and instantaneous mi xing after a contact with the assumption of even contamination of media at a locality. Eisenbe rg and Koopman have addressed these modeling issues in risk asessm ent studies focused on water (Chick et al. 2001, Chick et al. 2002, Eisenberg et al. 2004, Eisenberg et al. In press, Soller et al. 2003). The goal in this proposal is to generalize th ese concepts to other media im portant in pathogen transmission and expand them in ways that enable environm ental contamination measurements contribute more to the conformation of transmission system models. One important extension to this model will be to capture temporal patterns for incubation and contagious periods. We will examine different approaches to capturing these patterns using different distributional forms. To retain an ordinary differential equation format consistent with our deterministic compartmental models, we wi ll employ a strategy of sequential cycling of compartments. It is possible to approximate most shapes usin g sequential compartments with different recirculation patterns through the sequence. In the below diagram the contagious process is assumed to move th rough a series of compartments with a fraction of population skipping certain processes and othe r population fractions reverting b ack to previous processes. A simplified version of this approach was used in previous modeling studies (Eisenberg et al. In press, Eisenberg et al. 1998). A lternatively, when we transit to discrete individual model forms, we will also examine the use of functional dist ribution forms as in Gupta and Haas (Gupta and Haas 2004). When inferences are shown to be ro bust to incubation period distribution forms, we will of course use the most computationally efficient forms. 46 Modeling environmental fate and transport Consistent with our philosophy of relating simpler and more complex models and models that make contrasting assumptions, we will assess the level of detail in the models developed by the exposure group that is necessary to make appropriate control inferences. We will do this initially by capturing the patterns of output from the exposure group models in a compartmental model analysis form. As with incubation and contagious period, temporal patterns for agent survival in the environment may assume different shapes as a result of the exposure models developed, and it is possible to approximate most shapes using sequential compartments with different recirculation patterns through the sequence. We will use this strategy to assess the importance for control inferences of any model refinements in these distributions developed by the exposure group. The attached figure gives a schematic for such a compartmental analysis approach. If the shapes make a difference, then we will proceed to integrate the actual exposure group models. As with the previous model discussed above, the dashed arrows in the figures connecting media boxes in the adjacent figure represent th e influence of infec tious individuals on environmental contamination and the influence of environmental contamination on infection risks. Transport of media is an issue for water where the sites of contamination and uptake may differ. Transport will be addressed by a set of compartment flows orthogonal to time. A related issue is when surface contamination results ultim ately in aerosol transmission. Many years ago Koopman demonstrated the importance of th is phenomenon for diphtheria transmission (Koopman and Campbell 1975). Environmental meas urements of diphtheria contamination were found to be far greater in the pr esence of infected i ndividuals with skin lesions. In turn, respiratory infection risk was found to be gr eater in the presence of the environmental contamination. The Amoy Gardens episode in Hong Kong(Lau et al. 2004, Yu et al. 2004), aircraft transmissions(Olsen et al. 2003) and the laboratory transmissions that have been documented(Orellana 2004) illustrate the poten tial importance of such phenomena for SARS. The exposure group will have primary responsibility for developing environmental models that account for this route of transmission. A double layer of media where the surface media feeds into the aerosol media would be a simple way to approach this situation. One utility of such a double media model may be that decontamination meas ures might be cheaper if they are directed to preventing aerosolization rather than to complete elimination of viable organisms. S E1 E2 Ei R In I1 I3 47 Contact pattern generation To complete the description of transmission, c ontact patterns of indi viduals must also be incorporated into the transmission models. All m ovement to different sites where the time spent at a site is relatively short will be modeled in a statistical mechanics framework where fractions of each individual are continuously at each site. Only when act ual residence migration occurs, such as when people move out of an epidemic area, will migration be addressed. By specifying the amount of time that individual s with different characteristics sp end at each site, one generates contact patterns that may vary from assortative to proportionate mixing in as many dimensions as there are environmental sites. This framework cannot inco rporate dissassortative contact patterns such as those generated by medical pers onnel directing their contacts to patients. We would only address such contac ts if and when we see the need for a specific robustness assessment that takes into account disassortativ e contacts. We would only do so within the discrete individual stochastic models. Environmental sites may be described as abst ractly as broad areas of a city and as specifically as specific rooms in specific buildings . Hospitals in particular may be important sites to model since special contamination prevention and decontamination actions are often taken there. The level of detail needed for social structure define d by environmental site attendance will vary depending upon the control measures being evaluated. For decontamination, broad sites may be adequate. Fo r quarantine, local sites such as homes may be needed. Accounting for heterogeneity in the infection process Variability in transmission processes often dr ive risk. For example, water quality data collected in the source and fini shed waters suggest that ofte n there are no pathogens, while occasionally the concentrations are quite high. This suggests that infection occurs in the form of outbreaks. When the magnitude of a cluster of cas es is small and below detection level it will go unnoticed. The sum of these small outbreaks are of ten captured in surveillance as an aggregate and viewed as the endemic level. Only when the magnitude of a cluster of cases is above a threshold does it get categorized as an outbreak. Likewise, infectious individuals often recover without transmitting the pathogen to anyone. Occas ionally, however, there are individuals that are labeled \"super-spreaders\" in that they w ill transmit the pathogen to a large number of individuals. This was well documented in the SA RS epidemic (Shen et al. 2004). Other sources of heterogeneity also exist such as differential susceptibility. Susceptib ility of individuals may vary by different demographic factors such as age or immune status. Each of these demographic groups will have different dose-response relationships. We will construct models that include these heterogeneities. We will explore different model structures to handle exposure variab ility, contact patterns , and dose-response. Specifically, we will be interested in examin ing the impact of each of these types of heterogeneities on risk estimates. Model Parameterization and Identifiability To apply the models developed as described in Section 2.1 in a risk assessment requires a process of identifying values for parameters used in a given model. For some parameters this may be a simple process of extracting data from the literature, since a ll model parameters will have some sort biological or physical interpre tation. For example, either a point value or distributional estimate for incubation period could come straight from a literature review 48 (incorporating a distri bution may also have structural impli cations for the model as discussed in Section 2.1). Alternatively, outco me data (either incidence or environmental) may be used to identify parameters statistically. Standard st atistical techniques, how ever, are not generally useful for fitting the types of m odels discussed in Section 2.1. Un like standard statistical models whose primary aim is a succinct description of the stochastic relationship between observed random variables, population dynamic models ar e mechanistic representations of complex population processes. As such, the model parameters are easily interpretable and scientifically relevant, however the relationship between th ese parameters and the model output can be complex. The overall objective of tasks discussed in this section is to first create a database of information important to parameterizing and iden tifying models, and second to examine a variety of statistical techniques that address the problems associated with highly parameterized nonlinear models. Developing a database of relevant epidemiological and environmental data Although most of our transmission related ri sk assessment will focus on noroviruses and SARS, we plan to develop a database with a wide r set of bioterrorist re levant pathogens. We will include a variety of b acterial pathogens, such as Francisella tularencis , as well as a variety of viral pathogens, such as pox viruses, Hepatitis A, and Ebola. For all of these pa thogens, a literature search will be conducted to compile: 1) information on outbreaks and prospective epidemio logy studies, and 2) information on important biological and environmental processes. This information on outbreaks will be gathered by taking advantage of previous work conducted by the CDC and EPA. A literature search using the standard bibliographic data bases will be next conducted to obtain any outbreaks not compiled by the CDC or EPA. To gather informati on on important biological and environmental processes we will begin by integrating database s already developed from previous projects by investigators of this specific project module (Eis enberg, Koopman), as well as investigators from the Center (Nicas, Haas). Again, a literature s earch will follow to collect any information missed by previous data gathering activit ies or that have been published in the last few years. Other investigators from the Center (Keim, Rose, H aas, Nicas) will participate in this database development task. The integration among projec ts will be particularly facilitated by the knowledge management depository to be developed at Drexel for CAMRA. Statistical techniques for examining control strategies In parallel with these database activities, we plan to examine, and modify if necessary, the following statistical approaches: robust as sessment using least squares, profile likelihood, Bayesian, and a regional sensitivity analysis Robust assessment using least squares fitting For nonlinear system parameter estimation, it is quite difficult to assure that the least squares parameter search reaches a global minimu m. This is especially the case for complex models with many parameters to f it. To address this issue, we haven taken an approach that seeks to specify diverse parameter sets that fit the data and to evaluate deci sions across all of the parameter sets that fit the data. An example of this is our SARS analysis, in which we established a close collaborati on with the people who controlled the Beijing SARS epidemic. We extracted a set of 25 data points from the mo re that 50 specific rese arch files they have established on epidemic data. The data showed that less than 20% of cases were diagnosed 49 through tracing, and that the average time between symptom onset and diagnosis fell from 6.3 days early in the epidemic to less than 2 days at the end. These data suggest that improved diagnosis without tracing did much more to control th e epidemic than tracing. But our unique analyses and robustness assessments showed th e opposite to be true. Our model captured the dynamics of: diagnosis with is olation; contact tracing with qu arantine; contact rate reduction from public behavior change and public health actions; and diagnosis of noncoronavirus atypical pneumonia cases as SARS. To make inferences about control actions we developed a robustness assessment strategy. For each of the 16 model pa rameters we found the extreme values that would still allow for the average data point ge nerated by the model to be within 20% of the observed values when all of the other parameters were allowed to vary. We then examined several intermediate values using different initi al guess values in the least squares minimization algorithms. For each of 160 fits found, we examin ed the effect of eliminating either the improved diagnosis program or the tracing prog ram. Thus we have extensive robustness assessments on our inferences about these two e ffects. In each of the 160 fits, eliminating tracing had the bigger effect. On average the difference was five fold. The reason for this surprising effect was readily demonstrated by our model analysis to be that the nonlinear dynamics of tracing amplified the effects of di agnosis without tracing while there was no such effect in the opposite direction. Analysis also demonstrated that we s hould have considerable power for analysis of other control actions in Beijing, such as the extensive decontamination efforts they undertook, once the sera on the 2521 proba ble cases weed out fa lse positive cases. Profile Likelihood Another way around the problems associated wi th highly parameterized models is the profile likelihood approach (Brookhart et al. 2002). In this appr oach maximum likelihood estimates are obtained by fixing a set of parameters of interest over a rang e of values and then maximizing the full likelihood over the remaining \"nuisance\" parameters. The likelihood ratio test provides a reference value fo r evaluating particular parameter sets. Those sets with profile likelihood values above the reference value are c onsidered reasonable and are included in the confidence interval while those belo w are rejected as implausible. This approach leads to robust confidence intervals. The computational adva ntages are derived from being able to fix parameters that are either inte resting or troublesome, so that the remaining optimization problem is simplified. Prior information about nuisance parameters (e.g. duration of infection) can be incorporated into the estimation approach by cons training the particular pa rameter to a range of realistic values. In analyzing the Cryptosporidium outbreak in Milwaukee, we were able to use the parameter estimates obtained using this prof ile likelihood approach to make predictions on differing causes of the outbreak and potential control efforts to minimize the chances of other outbreaks like this on e occurring (Eisenberg et al. In press). Bayesian technique To examine attributable risks, MLE technique s like those described above are limited for obtaining inference on attributable risk estimates. Bayesian techniques provide an approach to estimate the multivariate posterior distribution of the model parameters. For every combination of previously identified profiled parameters, th e resulting parameters can be estimated using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) technique. To handle the potential colinearities (non- identifiabilities) of parameter estimates in the data a novel two- step approach to the Metropolis-50 Hasting procedure (Metropolis a nd Hasting, 1971) can be used to generate samples from the posterior parameter distribution (AJE). First, we created a dense grid of the parameter subspace defined by the parameters over which we profile. For each point in this multi-dimensional grid, we run the MH algorithm over the remaining para meters to generate a posterior distribution assuming the parameters defining the grid are fixe d. When this procedure is finished, the result is a sample of all parameters and the associ ated likelihood. Finally, we employ a random MH algorithm that uses as trial parameter sets, rows from this data set. After this second step is performed, the result is a sample of the multivariate posterior distribution of all the parameters. This procedure was used to establish the c ontribution of secondary transmission in the Milwaukee outbreak (Eisenberg et al. In press). Regional sensitivity analysis Traditional likelihood approach requires in cidence data as well as a measure of uncertainty of those data. An alternative approach is based on the idea that rather then fitting the model to the data output as in the previous case study, the output can be characterized as either a background endemic condition or an outbreak conditi on. In most microbial risk assessments, such as the one discussed in Section 2.1 on deve loping control strategies for minimizing risks associated with swimming, incidence data is l acking (Eisenberg et al . 2002, Eisenberg et al. 1996). In this manner the output is classified in to one of two categories. To obtain the output needed for classification, probability distribut ions are assigned to each model parameter and multiple simulations are conducted. Specifically, for each simulation, a set of parameter values is obtained by randomly sampling the parameter distributions. The distributions are uniform unless the parameter range spans more than tw o orders of magnitude, in which case a log- uniform distribution is used to more efficiently explore the full range of values. Assigning a bounded uniform or log-uniform distribution to each parameter allowed us to take into account data from various literature s ources without biasing towards one value or another. A binary classification algorithm is then applied to each simulation output, in which the output either passes or fails a set of criteria. This binary cl assification is essentially a goodness-of-fit criterion based on whether or not the output is representative of the data. The multivariate parameter distribution associated with a background/above background classificat ion is then analyzed using any of a number of classification al gorithms. The details of this approach are given in a previous publication (Eisenberg et al. 1996). Modeling Outbreaks and Developing control strategies General models for insight development Our first aim of this objective will be to develop general models that will provide general insight. These insights will in turn help in the construction of models formulated to address specific control decisions in specific circumstances. We will perform sensitivity analyses for the final size of epidemics across the full feasib le parameter space. Model exploration for sensitivities will be first performed using de terministic compartmental models with broad definitions of environmental sites. This w ill be followed by using stochastic compartmental models in those parameter spaces found to be of interest in the dete rministic compartmental model exploration. To obtain hete rogeneity at the individual leve l, for example to examine the impact of superspreading events, requires more detail than a compartmental model provides. For these applications, individual-level ev ent history models will be developed. 51 When any surprising sensitivities are found at any level, we will proceed to explore model behavior until we have logical explana tions for these. Using linked models across different model forms helps in finding insightfu l explanations. For example, to explain a surprising sensitivity found using the deterministic compartmental model form, individual event histories might be followed in the comparable individual event histor y model to check out hypotheses about why the be havior is occurring. Scenario models for evaluating bi oterrorist control strategies Using the insight from our general model analysis, more specific and detailed models will be formulated to examine specific control decisi ons. For example, we will develop models for SARS to examine different contamination scenario s such as: 1) from single introductions; 2) from massive contaminations in restricted environmental sites; and 3) from diffuse introductions all at one time or over time affecting widely scattered individuals. We will borrow from our own experience analyzing the Beijing SARS epidemic as well as the work of Boz zette et al. (Bozzette et al. 2003) who examined control scenarios for smallpox threats. One important focus in this grant will be to examine decontamination as a control measure. In the Beijing SARS epidemic, d econtamination was an expensive and disruptive activity that was never well eval uated and that WHO officials tended to discount. Given superspreader dissemination of infection, there is considerable potential for environmental contamination to play key roles in disseminatin g infection in the tran smission system. Even though decontamination may potentially preven t only 10% or fewer of infections, the transmissions it prevents at public environmental sites wher e many people could pick up the contamination, could potentially play key roles in preventing transmission. In a bioterrorist episode, decontamination may play a larger role than in a natural epidemic. While the focus of our SARS work within th is EPA grant is environmental contamination assessment and decontamination, realistic scenar io assessment requires that we specify full ranges of other control efforts. The difference will be that we will not pursue analyses to make decisions for other control modes. We will just take them as given events and explore decisions about decontamination in the cont ext of those given events. Environmental contamination will also be the focus of our waterborne transmission work. A primary question for these pathogens (focusing on noroviruses as our mark er pathogen) will be on the comparison between localized and centralized control. Our previous work has suggested that there are certain important tradeoffs betw een intervening at a local level by supplying individuals with water treatment devices or at the central leve l by improving water treatment at the drinking water plant. These tradeoffs depe nd heavily on transmission patterns. Similarly, contamination of surface waters can be addres sed locally by limiting exposure or centrally through treatment processes. We will construct environmentally mediated models as described above to account for the geographic patterns of infec tion that were observed. In our scenarios the public health personnel will take either a ge neral control approach, such as mass vaccination, or a more focused approach, such as targeted vaccination. The decision whether or not to focus control efforts is one of the most important in public h ealth. Logistically it can be demanding to focus efforts. One must have a str ong rationale for doing so. Thus most major public health control efforts like mass vaccination programs are designed for general rather than focused coverage. But decontamination of environmental sites where transmission has occurred or where a bioterrorist might have seeded an agent must be focal in order to be practical. Given limited resources, the issues are how much of av ailable resources should be dedicated to 52 decontamination and where should decontaminat ion take place as well as when and where barrier protections like masks and gowns will contri bute most to epidemic control. The use of masks, for example, by the general public was found to be protective against SARS infection both in Hong Kong(Lau et al. 2004) and Beijing(Pang et al. 2003). Using our Beijing SARS models elaborated to the local le vel and in individual event history form with incorporated public health personnel, we will explore bioterrorist control potential given single introductions, massive focal contaminations, and multiple small contaminations at dispersed sites that occur si multaneously or over time. For each scenario we will explore 100 different parameter settings chosen consistent with the approach used in the attached paper. This will be a more complex ta sk than that presented in the paper, however, as the model will be more detailed and will be stochastic. Again our linkages to other model forms will be essential to choosing the 100 parame ter settings for further exploration. Likewise, we will also modify these models to examine analogous water related control issues for a variety of exposure events with nor oviruses. As with the SARS example, we will focus on three types of contamin ation: single introductions, massi ve focal contaminations, and multiple small contaminations at dispersed s ites that occur simultaneously or over time. Developing analysis strategies that ca n be used in emergency situations We cannot expect analyses made prior to a bioterrorist emergenc y to guide us through control of that emergency. Too much is unknow n and variable. We must depend upon fast and accurate analyses during the emergency. Our Beijing analysis clearly demonstrates that the models used for such an analysis must realisti cally capture key aspects of the nonlinear dynamics of infection transmission and th e nonlinear dynamics of control ac tions like contact tracing and quarantine. It also indicates that assessment of temporal patterns for contact behavior will be helpful. But this deserves furt her exploration und er this grant. We will next evaluate the utility of both our airborne (using SARS as our marker pathogen) and waterborne (using norovirus as our marker pathoge n) transmission models. Each model will have sufficient detail to describe envi ronmental contamination and transport. We will use these to evaluate the util ity of our model analyses appr oaches when many aspects of infection and environmental contamination are ra ndomly selected and unknown to an analyst that is using computer simulation output to help make control decisions; i.e ., the analyst will not know what bioterrorist scenario initiated the epidemic, what e nvironmental sites generate the widest dissemination of cases, wh at environmental sites generate the greatest total number of cases, nor where aerosolization might be a problem. Given limited resources they will take data from the simulations, fit models to that data, a nd make decontamination decisions on the basis of that data. Their ability to decrease epidemic size in comparison to epidemics where no decontamination or unfocused decontamination takes place will be analyzed as a function of the models and data used as well as th e situations generating the epidemic. Using environmental measuremen ts to guide control actions Within the above analysis of simulated epidemic s will be the use of varying levels of data on contamination levels at different sites and varying leve ls of sensitivity and specificity of such data. For SARS, these data will not be confined to the analysis of decontamination decisions. We will evaluate its use in fitting epidemic models for the purpose of evaluating the three control modes addressed in our attached submitted paper. To this end, we will use individual event history models to generate the data and deterministic compartmental models that explicitly model environmental contamination to analyze the data. We will compare the accuracy of 53 assessment of the three control methods addr essed in our paper with and without the environmental data. For norovirus, will plan to evaluate different environmental sampling strategies, such as, comparing using low dete ction limit methods and lower sampling frequency in time and space, with using high detection li mit methods and higher sampling frequency in time and space. We will also examine the most e fficient sampling strategy given variability in environmental contamination levels. We suspect that given environmental contam ination data, a more accurate assessment of the effects tracing and quarantine, early diagnosis , and general contact reduction will be possible than without the environmental contamination data. If that is the case, then even if we show that decontamination will not contribute much to epid emic control, our models will be particularly productive. Note that environmenta l contaminations do not have to be viable to provide this sort of utility nor for that matter to help direct decont amination efforts. They merely have to indicate that environmental contamination has taken pla ce. If this in fact proves useful, it should stimulate the development of more readily deploy able environmental monitory technology of the needed sensitivity and specificity levels. Expected Results and Benefits Our work will contribute essential elements to control of a bioterrorist disease outbreak related to infections transmissible via water or combined droplet and airborne routes. It will determine the agent, host, and environmental asp ects of an outbreak that make environmental sampling, environmental decontamination, and ins titution of barriers to environmental exposure worthwhile. It will provide ge neral insights as to when and where environmental sampling will be most informative in guiding control d ecisions and when and where environmental decontamination and exposure barriers will be most productive. It will also provide general insights as to what environmental sampling strate gies with regard to frequency, intensity, and spatial and social extent of sampling is indicate d. Likewise it will defi ne what other exposure surveillance activities like monitoring of public behavior over the course of an outbreak will contribute most to epidemic control decisions. Our work will determine the relative contributions of decontamination versus contac t tracing and quarantine, improved diagnosis and isolation, and behavioral change th at reduces exposure or contact. It will be especially helpful in determining when and where airborne exposur e reduction measures like wearing masks and fomite contact measures like wearing gowns w ill contribute most to epidemic control, or conditions when and where household advisories on boiling or filtering water would be warranted. Our work will also contribute essential tools for analyzing bioterrorist emergency situations involving transmissibl e agents. We will define what model forms and model details are needed to make robust inferen ces about the effects of control actions from different levels of information that might be available. This transmission modeling activity will define what level of detail in environmental exposure models will contribute control decisions. Likewise it will define what areas of research and development of environmental sampling and analyzing methods will c ontribute most to the control of transmission.

New England Journal of Medicine 350: 1731-9. 57 Project III. Dose Response Assessment Objectives In the risk assessment framework there are a number of sources of heterogeneity. Some sources are clearly associ ated with heterogeneity in exposure. However others are functions of heterogeneity amongst the individuals or within the population that is exposed. The sources of heterogeneity in the ef fects assessment include the following: Variability in the intrinsic infectivity and vi rulence of the infecti ous agents (including potential alterations from \"weaponiza tion\" of organisms of concern) Variability in the response of individuals to the infectious agen t (and modification by intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing susceptibility) Immune status (outcome from prior exposure and alterations due to other physiological factors) Differences in exposure to infected individuals in the contagious st ate (presence of \"super- spreaders\" or failures of quarantine or containment) Behavioral and venue differences affecting the exposure to sour ces of contagion arising from a primary infected individual Differences in severity and durati on of outcomes resulting from exposure The first three factor s relate particularly to the do se-response relationship (although the duration and strength of initial immunity relates also to the prior transmission dynamic in an exposed population). The remaining factors relate primarily to population transmission modeling. It is generally envisioned that bioterrorist attacks will occur through the environment. The record of bioterrorist incidents and biocrime s (Carus, 2001), as well of \"natural\" infectious disease outbreaks illustrates the myriad potential routes of exposure. Risk assessment models, therefore, must have an explic it description of the exposure path ways that are relevant for bio- terrorist activities. Regardless of the route of exposure, knowle dge of the dose-response relationship is needed to conduct either a sta tic (individually based) or dyna mic (population risk assessment considering disease transmission pa thways) risk assessment. The obj ective of this project is to comprehensively review and analyze dose response relationships for potential bioterrorist agents. This will facilitate quick decision making (in the context of an emergency response), and comprehensive risk-based asse ssment of cleanup alternatives. Approach Development of Dose-Response Relationships We will develop critically reviewed dose-response relationships for the bioterrorist agents of greatest concern that could be transmitted vi a inhalation in the workplace. These could be used to develop PEL's, acceptable clearance cr iteria, and for other regulatory and action level purposes. The work we will conduct includes the following activities: 58 We will perform a thorough literature review to obtain data (on CDC category A agents) that could be used to develop dose-response relations hips for the agents of concern. This will include information obtained from animal and hu man studies. We will outreach to potential governmental and other sources of unpublished data to incorporate into our analysis. We will critically evaluate these data for applicability. We will test mathematical formulations that have been used in other quantitative microbial risk assessment applications and compare their perf ormance to empirical relationships, e.g. log- probit, that have been used in other applicat ions. Mathematical formulations will include dependence on additional variables (e.g., particle di ameter, gender, age) as the data warrants. We will review the literature for human outbreaks of illness resulting from inhalation exposure to these agents - of particular interest ar e studies that contain information on both morbidity/mortality rates and exposure. We will compare the experienced morbidity/mor tality rates found in out break studies to the predicted morbidity/mortality rates estimated (using the exposures th at resulted in the outbreak) from the dose-response rela tionships developed so as to validate the use of those dose-response relationships for assessing human risks. We will develop and test a next-generation of dose response models considering details of in vivo transport and fate of pathogen to th e site of colonization and infection We will conduct animal experiments to extend th e knowledge base found in the prior literature, particularly with respect to quantifying physiolo gical parameters that can be used in more sophisticated dose-response models, and elucidating the impacts on susceptible subpopulations. The concept that exposure to infectious organisms can be described by a dose-response relationship has been explicitly acknowledged si nce at least the 1950's (Wells, 1955). This concept was elaborated upon by Riley and O'Gra dy, who recognized that there may be various intrinsic and extrinsic modifi ers to infectivity of organisms (Riley and O'Grady, 1961). Since the early 1980's (Haas, 1983; Haas et al. , 1999) a paradigm for describing risk from exposure to microorganisms has emerged in which the standard risk assessment techniques are employed to estimate risk from pathogenic mi croorganisms. A number of senior personnel on the CAMRA team have been integral to the development and advancement of this paradigm. These techniques primarily have been applied to various ingestion (Regli et al. , 1991; Crockett et al., 1996; 1998; Teunis et al., 1999) and dermal exposures (Rose and Haas, 1999). Only more recently has quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) been applied to inhalation exposures, in the context of bioaerosol emi ssions from sludge disposal operations(Dowd et al. , 2000). The PI of this project ha s developed the first (known) dose response relationships for the inhalation of Bacillus anthracis spores (Haas, 2002). Searching for Data The data needed to perform dose-response an alyses, and to validate the models against human outbreak/accident reports wi ll be obtained from a comprehe nsive literature review. The process for reviewing the literature can be divi ded into two phases -- bibliography development and assessment/extraction of information. To develop a bibliography we shall rely to a large degree on computer-based search strategies. Our primary database s of use are anticipated to be Index Medicus (available publicly 59 at http://www.nlm.nih.gov ) and Web of Science (the electronic version of Science Citation Index ), which is available at Drexel University. We plan to use both subject-based search strategies and citation ba sed search strategies to extend our bibliography to the maximum extent possible. We will also be aided by our collaborators on the knowledge discovery effort in CAMRA with respect to de vising and perfecting our in formation search methods. Subject based search strategies will focus on running various keyword combinations to acquire citations that (based on title and abstract ) appear promising. We will in general combine terms describing organism and disease (e.g., Francisella tularensis or tularemia) with terms denoting outcome, exposure route or endpoint. An in itial glossary of terms is shown below. In formulating our descriptors fo r organisms we will use both old and superseded taxonomic nomenclature. As an example of subject-base d strategies, use of the terms Filovirus and infectivity in Index Medicus results in a number of hits, includi ng one in which cynomolgus monkeys were exposed to the Ebola-Reston strain of virus by aerosol (Jahrling et al. , 1996). Based on the title and abstract, this reference appears to possibl y contain useful data, and would be acquired. As an example of citation-based strategies an Index Medicus search on the combination of Yersinia pestis and infectivity yields a reference on efficacy of antibiotics in treatment of pneumonic plague in mice (Byrne et al. , 1998). Examination of the bibliography of that paper yields a 1948 case report of an out break of pneumonic plague (Tieh et al. , 1948). Use of the citation search capability in Web of Science shows that there have b een 10 citations to the 1948 incident report including a le tter appearing in 1 994 on plague infectivit y (Cowling and Moss, 1994). In this manner a network or web of referen ces can be developed to form the starting point of the analysis phase.

As illustrated in Figure 1 , references located via a subj ect matter search can be used as starting points to \"search forward\" in a citati on search. The former can also be used (via selection of references in the literature cited th erein) to locate earlier so urces which can be used as additional entry points into a citation search. Additional sources to be examined (both for information and for citations to the primary literature) will be monographs and review articles. The USAMRIID handbook on medical management of casualties forms one significant such monograph (U.S. Army Medical Research Institute Of Infectious Diseases, 2001). The reviews of specific agents, for example on plague (Inglesby et al. , 2000) are examples of major review articles serving as star ting points for a search strate gy. CDC and WHO web sites will also be searched for applicable monographs a nd reports. We will also do a web search, using standard search engines (e.g., G oogle) to obtain leads on additi onal data sets (reports, for example) that are not covere d by the journal data bases. To the degree which information may be available in gray sources, we will use our contacts to obtain this. For example, Profe ssor Haas has been on several committees of the National Academy relating to bioterrorism, and he also has served on a working group on dose response modeling convened by the US Army Ce nter for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine (CHPPM) and has thereby become familiar with (some) agencies that may have data. However for security classification reasons, such data may or may not be accessible. Data Acceptance Criteria Once a bibliography is established, it is neces sary to examine each of the references and ascertain whether or not useful data can be ex tracted. For this purpose, it is necessary and desirable to define data acceptance criteria. The details of the crit eria differ for information to be used for developing dose-response relationships, and for information used for validation (from outbreaks or human case reports). The acceptance cr iteria for the two classe s of information are detailed below. Dose-Response Information To be useful as a source of dose-respons e data, the study must report the number of subjects (e.g., animals) that are administered pa rticular doses of microorganisms and the mode of administration. Of those exposed, the number that have been regarded as positive (infected, ill, dead) must also be recorded. The criteria for positive endpoints, such as definition of infection, must be detailed. The mode of preparation of th e inhaled organisms must be described including characterization of the particle di ameter, since the infectivity of aer osols is dependent on particle size (Watson and Keir, 1994). The organisms must be measured by an appropriate assay specific for the organism in question. Data sets that meet these quality screens will be used for analysis. Subject Matter Search Search TermsReferences to Evaluate Citation SearchBase ReferenceCiting References to Evaluate Figure 1 Search Strategies. 61 Outbreak Data To be useful for validation of dose response re lationships, outbreak (o r case) reports must contain the following information: Number of subjects exposed Number of subjects affected Estimation of exposure (distribution). In the ab sence of this, sufficient information about the mass released and dispersion characteristic s to allow estimation of the exposure distribution, for example using the approach taken by Meselson et al. in regard to the Sverdlovsk accident (Meselson et al. , 1994; Meselson, 1995). Duration of exposure Endpoint examined (infection, illness, mortality). Differentiation between prim ary and secondary cases. Characteristics (size) of inhaled particles. It is likely that outbreak information will fr equently (as in the case of the Sverdlovsk incident) not contain all of the above information. In these cases, the missing information will be estimated based on best available resources - for example population maps, meteorological records, etc. Candidate Models One intrinsic feature of risk assessment is that the data us ed to define a dose-response relationship are most often of n ecessity obtained at relatively hi gh dose (and risk) levels Hence a mathematical relationship is necessary to extrapolat e to depict the risk at lower exposure levels. This problem occurs both with chemicals and with microbial agents. It has long been known, for example see (Van Ryzin, 1980), that different f unctional forms of dose response relationships may yield quite different low dose risk levels. Hence the use of a particular mathematical relationship must be constraine d by a belief that it provides a pl ausible representation of the underlying process1. For over fifty years, it has been know n that the single organism hypothesis2 produces results consistent with observed infection dose re sponse. Some early historical work on this point are the studies of Lauffer and Price on virus (1945), Goldberg et al. (1954) on respiratory bacterial and viral agents, and Meynell and Stocker (1957) on Salmonella. This is also supported by recent work on occupational inhalation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Nicas, 1996). From a basic point of view, an individual viab le organism contains all of the information necessary to reproduce. Perhaps the most persuasive lines of ev idence for the single organism hypothesis, other than pure fits to dose response curves, have be en reviewed by Rubin (1987). The two most successful models consistent with the single organism hypothesis have been the exponential and the beta-Poisson models(Haas et al. , 1999); both of which ( Table 1 ) 1 The word \"belief\" is used deliberately, since it fundamentally impossible to prove the truth of a particular relationship, rather than to fail to disprove its applicability. 2 That a single organism is sufficient, if it su rvives the defense mechanisms, to initiate the infection and disease processes. 62 share the characteristic that the risk at low doses is a linear f unction of dose. It should also be noted that the consistency between outbreak data and risks extrapolated from human volunteer trials has been demonstrated in a number of situations, for example (Rose et al. , 1991; Haas and Rose, 1994; Crockett et al. , 1996). It should also be noted that the exponential, as well as a mixture of the exponential distribution that is equivalent to the beta-Poisson has been employed in assessing risks from the inhalation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Nicas, 1996). Table 1. Exponential and Beta-Poisson Dose Response Models. Model Equation (risk=) Reference Exponential 1expkd() (Wells, 1955; Haas et Beta-Poisson (Furumoto and Mickey, 1967; Haas, 1983) The Beta-Poisson equation is a simplified form of a model which can be written in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function (Furum oto and Mickey, 1967; Haas, 1983; Teunis and Havelaar, 2000). The data obtained will be fit to the exponentia l and beta Poisson models. In addition, the use of models in which more than one colonizati on is needed to cause the effect will be tested (Haas et al. , 1999). The suite of empirical models employed by Holcomb et al. (1999) will also be explored. Fitting Criteria Given a set of data on infectivity, or some other endpoint (such as illness, or even mortality), we would like to obtai n the best fit to a particular dose-response model. In general, the data set available for dose-response analysis is one in which several sets of subjects (either human or animal) are each exposed to a known mean dose, and the subsequent response, in terms of infection, illness, or mortality, is determin ed. Nomenclature for dose-response studies is given in Table 2 . A particular dose-response model is selected for study. This model is characterized by a function, which predicts the proportion of positiv e responders given dose and values of one or several dose response parameters. In a generic se nse, we can write the predicted response as i=PIdi;i() , where is the set of dose-response parameters. We will also define the response for each set based strictly on the observations as i0=pi ni. If the individual subjects have independent responses, then the overall system can be characterized using a similar likelihood framework as was used for analyzing dilution assays. This unconstrained Table 2 Schematic Layout of Dose-Response Assay. set Average dose of microorganisms number of subjects in the set positive subjects (*) 1 d 1 n 1 p 1 2 d 2 n 2 p 2 3 d 3 n 3 p 3 4 d 4 n 4 p 4 (*) with infection, illne ss, death, or some other positive indicator of response 63 optimization problem can be solved numerical ly as we have previously utilized (Haas et al. , 1993; Haas et al. , 1996; Haas et al. , 1999). This problem can be solved in EXCEL (Haas, 1994), MATLAB or Mathematica. Goodness of fit can be ascertained using a likelihood ratio test on the residual deviance from the best fit (Morgan, 1992). If we have two dose-response models, where mo del 2 is a special case of model 1, with numbers of parameters m 1 and m 2, where m 2<m 1, then we can compare the statistical significance of the improvement in fit by examining against a 2 distribution with m 1-m 2 degrees of freedom. The null hypothesis (that the f its are indistinguishable ) is rejected if the difference in deviances exceeds the critical value, i. e., if the difference is in excess of the critical value, then we are justified in accepting the more complex model (with more parameters) in comparison to the more parsimonious model. Incorporation of Explanatory Variables If data sets are found in which there is ev idence for the possible dependence of response on an explanatory variable (e.g., age, gender, c onfounding exposures), then it is possible to test this possibility and to account for this in a dos e-response modeling framework. As an example, suppose that the illness as a func tion of dose is assumed to follow an exponential relationship but that it is further assumed that there is a lifelong buildup of imm unity that follows a separate exponential relationship as noted below: where is a time constant for the buildup of im munity, and k is the dose-response parameter (Table 1 ). The combined model, consisting of the exponential dose-response relationship and (1) can be estimated via maximum like lihood to determine the parameters k 0 and . The significance of the putative e xplanatory variable can be determined by likelihood ratio comparisons. Error Bound Estimates an d Comparisons of Data An extension of the method of bootstrapping residuals appears to be suitable for dose- response data (Efron and Tibshira ni, 1993). In prior work (Haas et al. , 1993), we have used this approach in assessing risk from inge stion of viruses from drinking water. If we have several data sets , perhaps taken by different inve stigators, or on different microorganisms, or in different hosts (human an d animal, or two animal data sets), a logical question to ask is whether the resu lts of the two data sets can be pooled. In other words, can we characterize both data sets by the same dose-response relationship? This may be tested by also using a likelihood framework as in our work on Shigella (Crockett et al. , 1996). The inability to pool data may point to important mechanistic feat ures. These may include differences in species sensitivity, or the possession of virulence factors(Ewald, 1991; Levi n, 1996; Haraldo and Edberg, 1997). Another approach to modeling strain heteroge neity is to regard i ndividual strains as having been randomly sampled from a population of strains that could be used, and to estimate the hyperparameters associated w ith the between strain distribu tion of dose response parameters (which may be bi or multivariate). This approach was used by Teunis et al.(2002) in interpreting k=k0exp age (1)64 the infectivity of multiple strains of Cryptosporidium and if the data suggest it, it is one that we will test. There are some particular considerations that are appropriate to de veloping dose-response relationships for bioterro rist agents that will merit speci al consideration. These include: For inhalation agents, it is known that the size of the aerosol in which th e infectious agent is contained influence pathogenicity (Druett et al. , 1953), and therefore c onsideration of this as an explanatory variable may be necessary (or this may explain differences between data sets) \"weaponization\" or other surface treatment may in fluence retention and ultimately infectivity of an agent. While it is not likely that we will be able to obtain data from the open literature on this, it may be that sufficient da ta is available for a particular organism prepared under different conditions to inform dose response modeling. There may be changes in infectiv ity and virulence that can be co rrelated to genetic features - or alterations. The concept of virulence-factor-activity relationships (VFAR's), which will be studied in the one of the other CAMR A projects will be used to inform our incorporation of these changes in dose-response modeling. Validation We anticipate that most or all of the data sets used for construction of dose-response relationships will be based on animal studies. Validation against human data from outbreaks or accidents becomes important in assessing wh ether the animal-derived dose-response relationships provide an adequate descriptor of human risk. This will be a fundamental hypothesis that this study is designed to test. Th is will enable us to ascertain whether it may be necessary to correct for differences in lung depositi on (especially in the alveolar region) of fine particles between species, as suggested in th e context of non-biological particle deposition investigations (Palm et al. , 1956; Kliment et al. , 1972; Miller, 2000). The test of validation will be whether the risk predicted from use of the dose-response relationship(s) used with the exposure conditions for particular outbreaks are in concordance with the observed attack rates during those outbrea ks. We will consider the formal uncertainty estimates obtained from bootstrapping dose-resp onse curves, and in exposure estimates, along with uncertainties in estimation of attack rate (for example sa mpling errors) in undertaking this comparison. Our work with the oral exposure to Escherichia coli O157:H7 illustrates (Haas et al., 2000) the validation process. 65 Development of Physiologica lly Based Dose-Response Models (PBDRM) Figure 2. Conceptual Diagram of in vivo fate of Bacillus anthracis . From Thran et al. (Personal Communication) Acute Exposure Chronic ExposureAerosol Cloud 20,000 spores/L Alveoli of lungs (particles <5 \u00b5) Lymph nodes Dispersed Aerosol 500 spores/day Macrophages Blood Early Stage Illness Late Stage IllnessEnvironmental Concentration External Exposure Concentration at the Mouth and Nose Regionall y Deposited Tissue Dose ResponseIntake via breathing The microbial dose- response curves discussed above share a common feature in that they describe the end-point effect as a function of the administered dose (i.e., number of organisms ingested or inhaled). However the actual dose that is important in the causation of infection/illness is the dose delivered to a location where colonization can occur (and ultimately the number of organisms in vivo subsequent to colonization). This process can be described graphically (in the case of Bacillus anthracis ) as in Figure 2 . We hypothesize that if we can effectively predict the delivered dose (e.g. number of organisms inhaled and retained in the alveoli in the case of B.. anthracis ) or the body burdern (number of organisms that have multiplied in vivo at the colonization site), we can more precisely predict the risk than only by using administered dose. This is a parallel to the use of PBPK models in chemical risk assessment (Chinery and Gleason, 1993; McKone, 1993; Committee On Risk Assessment Of Hazardous Air Pollutants -- Commission on Life Sciences, 1994). 66 To employ this approach it is necessary to describe the processes governing the fate and transport of infectious agents from the portal of entry to the site of colonization. During the latter half of the project period, the literature will be reviewed for knowledge of such processes, and particularly their quantitative modeling, and physiologically based dose-response models (PBDRM) will be developed in which the end effect is modeled as a function of the delivered dose. We will benefit from the knowledge of Dr,'s Nazaroff, Nicas and McKone, who have worked on the modeling of inhalation transfer of pollutants with respect to inhaled agents. We hypothesize that the use of this approach, if demonstrated to be useful (which we will test by fitti ng dose-response data using these formulations) would offer the following benefits: It may offer the ability to predict the impact of different physical formulations on agent potency. For example, could the correction from administered dose to delivered dose quantitatively predict the effect of particle size on infectivity observed by Druett (1953) in the case of B. anthracis inhalation It may offer the ability to extrapolate between species if the primary difference between species is the delivery of the agent to the active site (or if the differences in intrinsic in vivo immune response could be quantitatively described for the various species of interest). The animal experiments discussed in the next subsection will help inform the development of PBDRM's. 1000104105 0.1 1Bootstrap estimation (2000 iterations) 95% Confidence Region (MLE) Best Fit parametersN50 alpha Figure 3.

From (Haas et al. , 1999). 67 Animal Dose-Response Experiments The approaches outlined here for mining ex isting data to estima te key dose-response parameters are likely to identify significant gaps in dose-response for one or more pathogens. To determine if highly target experimental data will serve to fill these gaps and provide a better foundation of the risk assessment model, we propose to conduct a series of experiments to define the dose-response relationship between two List A pathogens in relevant model hosts. In addition, because a bioterrorist event will likel y result in significant contamination of the environment including surfaces, soil, and wa ter, we will determine the dose-response relationships for exposures that occur by ingestio n and topical exposure. In addition, we will examine changes in the dose response that oc curs in particularly susceptible populations. The animal experiments will be carefully planned to provide precise data to inform the risk assessment models. Numbers of animals required to develop useful dose response parameters will be determined in concert with Dr. Haas and others on the CAMRA team. We will conduct experiments with 2 pathogens ( Francisella tularensis and Yersinia pestis ) in relevant animal models. We have chosen these pathogens to study because they are both of significant concern as potential bi oterrorist agents, they have ve ry wide host ranges and therefore can persist in the environment or reservoir hosts following an event, and there is incomplete information in the literature regarding dose-response parameters. Francisella tularensis subsp facultative intracellular pathogen that has a very large natural hos t range with over 100 species of wild animals, birds, and arthropod vectors being i nvolved. Most human infections are associated with contact with rabbits, and rodents or thei r habitats and these species are important in maintaining the infection in enzootic areas (Ellis et al. , 2002). Biting insects may also play a role as mechanical vectors for Francisellae. Fr ancisellae are also known to infect and persist in aquatic protozoans and water-associated outbreaks have been documented (Anda et al. , 2001; Tarnvik et al. , 2004). The typical primary routes of exposure for humans under natural conditions are associated with outdo or activities via contact with cont aminated air, water, soil, or vegetation or by handling ill or dead animals. Clin ical signs of tularemia in humans and animals depend on the route of exposure, the virulence of the infecting strain, and the immune status of the host (Ellis et al. , 2002). In concert with the CAMRA team we will examine the available literature on the dose-response of Francisella in animals and humans and identify parameters which need to be determined or validated e xperimentally. Mice are a good animal model for Francisella although there is some varia tion in the susceptibility of various mouse strains (Shen et al. , 2004; Chen et al. , 2004). Most infection and vaccine studies have used intradermal inoculation as the route of exposure and more recently aerosol challenge models have been standardized ( Shen et al. , 2004; Chen et al. , 2003). These experiments have identified median lethal doses for F. tularensis type A and B. There is compara tively little information regarding the dose-response following contact exposure or ingestion (Stenmark and Sjostedt, 2004; Meinkoth et al. , 2004). Yersina pestis causes the Plague and is a Gram-neg ative rod which is closely related to a number of intestinal pathogens and has a wide mammalian host range. Rodents are the natural reservoir of Y. pestis and the infection may be transmitted by biting insects, aerosol, contact, or ingestion (Perry and Fetherston, 1997). As in tu laremia, the clinical signs and clinical outcome differ in human and animal Y. pestis infections based on the route of exposure. Experimental studies have been done with subcut aneous inoculation of mice with Y. pestis and with a flea-bite 68 infection model (Russell et al. , 1995; Jarrett et al. , 2004). In each of these situations the infection progresses quickly and is highly lethal. There is little information about the dose- response relationship with other routes of exposure. We propose to study the dose-re sponse relationship between F. tularensis and Y. pestis in BALB/C mice that are exposed by aerosol, intr adermal inoculation (to mimic insect bites), ingestion, and contact routes of exposure. In the first experi ments, dose-response parameters will be described. In subsequent studies, deta iled histopathologic and culture studies will be performed to determine sites of initial colonization and subsequent spread to other tissues. Other studies will examine differences in dose respons e in special populations including weanling and geriatric mice. These data will be used to validate data mined from the literature and to provide a firm foundation for risk assessment of the consequences of an intentional rele ase of this agent. Expected Results and Benefits This project will produce a reference set of critically reviewed dose-response relationships for Category A agents (in human an d animal species where data are available). These will include best fit values and confiden ce distributions for parameters such as in Figure 3, and dose-response curves with upper and lower confidence limits such as in Figure 4 . By compiling dose-response relationships in various hosts and for various strains, in conjunction with information from other projects in CAMRA, we will be able to ascertain the inter-(microbe)species heterogeneity in infectivit y, and determine whether there are discernable genetic markers which may be correlated to such differences. This may facilitate an assessment of the potential for further alterati ons in a strain to change potency. Figure 5. Anticipated Project Timeline for Modeling and Literature Review.

She will be supported by a graduate student for the durati on of the project and ha s available experienced technical support that are trained and registered for work with Select Agents. Studies will be planned in Year 1, conducted in Years 2, 3, a nd 4, and in year 5, one mouse experiment is budgeted to fill any remaining gaps and incorporation of experimental data into risk assessments will be finalized. All animal experiments will be informed by the lite rature reviews to be conducted, and Professors Haas a nd Bolin will collaborate on statis tical aspects of experimental design and analysis of data. Facilities This project will be conducted at Drexel University in the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering. The environmental engineering program at Drexel has 6 faculty participating in its activit ies, 40 graduate students, and 30 undergraduates. Our computational facilities which will be used for this project include a cluster devoted to Prof. Haas' students, containing 5 Macintosh systems and 2 Windows systems. Drexel has a site license to SPSS, as well as routine software, and Professor Haas has maintained licenses for bibliographic and computational software (Matla b, Mathematica) for his student group. Office space is available for graduate students conducting research. Of particular note to this pr oject is that Drexel has rece ived recognition as one of the \"most wired\" and \"most wireless\" campuses, a nd our library resources (including access to bibliographic databases such as Web of Science and Compendex ) are accessible in any of our offices (including student offices) via both Ethernet and wireless connections. Dr. Bolin is the supervisor of the Select Agent Laboratory at MSU (650 sq. ft) and of a BSL3-Ag level containment laboratory (1400 sq ft ) that are part of the newly constructed Diagnostic Center for Population & Animal Health. Dr. Bolin, her staff, and her laboratories are registered for work with 9 Select Agents, including the agents identified here. All work with the highly infectious pathogens F. tularensis and Y. pestis will be conducted in BL3 containment in Dr. Bolin's labs or in BL3 containment animal faci lities at MSU. Dr. Bolin also has a 4000 sq. ft BL2 laboratory and support space (biohazardou s waste disposal, media preparation, etc) available to support aspe cts of this project. Project management and communication This project will be integrated into the overall structure of CAMRA by a variety of mechanisms. First, Professor Haas will serve as co-center director, and will be a member of the center steering committee. Second, he will co ntribute to (and benefit from) the knowledge repository which will serve as a rapid means of information ex change and discussion amongst all 70 center researchers. Third, he has had a long re cord of working with many of the other CAMRA investigators (so that time does not need to be spent in creating interpersonal ties): He, Joan Rose and Charles Gerba have collabor ated on joint research in the microbial risk assessment area, and other ar eas since the late 1980's. He has worked with Dr. Eisenberg and Koopman on a number of EPA panels and other activities developing and applying risk methodologies Professors Haas and Bolin will be in freque nt contact via voice and electronic means with respect to the design, conduct, analysis and interpretation of animal studies.

Assessment-Analysis Interface Lead: Dr. Patrick Gurian The Assessment-Analysis Interface 1.0 Objectives Estimating the risk presented by bioterrorism incidents presents a formidable challenge. Risk assessments rely on a series of interconnected mode ls of release, transport, attenuation, exposure, dose-response, health effects, and secondary tran smission of infectious ag ents. At the current time there are substantial uncertainties as to bot h the appropriate model form and/or parameter estimates for most of these models. In addition, exposure and risk are st rongly influenced by the behavior of the public, and there are substantial uncertainties as to how the public will respond in the aftermath of an attack. Addressing all these uncertainties simultaneously is not feasible even within the context of a major coordinated research effort such as the one proposed here. Therefore, it is crucial that research be focuse d on those areas where it is likely to produce the most valuable results. This research project will use analytical approaches from statistics, decision analysis, and psychology to produce such a prioritization of research needs and to identify, and begin to address, social factors th at can significantly influence risk. By focusing research efforts on productive lines of inquiry, this project has th e potential to greatly improve the practical usefulness of the results deri ved from the proposed research center. This project will link the technical research on bio-threats, which falls in the domain of risk assessment with the societal goal of managing risk which (along with risk assessment) constitutes the more general domain of risk analysis . This terminology was established by the National Research Council's \"Red Book\" (NRC 1983) in an effort to separate more objective, scientific issues from matters of public policy wh ich are likely to be the subject of contentious debate. While this separation may be helpful in some circumstances, some linkage between technical research and societal response is necessary to ensure that the tech nical research is to be directed towards answering questions relevant to risk management decisions, and that the societal response plan is informed by accurate technical information. The project will begin with an e ffort to identify exposure scenario s of concern (Objective 1). It will then identify the social factors that significantly influence risk management options for these scenarios (Objective 2) and the available technical unde rstanding (Objective 3) . Finally, it will integrate both technical and social factors (Objec tives 4 and 5) to evaluate the effectiveness of current response options and to prio ritize future research needs. A description of the approach to be followed for the realization of each of these five objectives is provided in detail below. 2. Approach Objective 1. Identification of Scenarios and Modeling Tools This task will develop the quantit ative framework for the project by identifying a set of exposure scenarios of concern to risk managers and a set of models that can address these scenarios. Risk managers will be consulted as to the scenarios of most concern to them, the policy options they expect to have, and any existi ng response plans. As many of these risk managers are also 76 technical experts, this consultation will be integr ated with the elicitation of the \"expert model\" (described in Objective 2 below). There is an incredible diversity of potential bioterro rism incidents. Given that is it not feasible to study all potential exposure scenario s, the research will focus init ially on a limited number of scenarios that capture the range of variation of possible incidents. At least one scenario is expected to consider the contamination of a si ngle building with anthrax or another persistent agent. At least one other scenario will cons ider an outdoor release of smallpox or a similar infectious agent likely to generate secondary cases . A third will consider an attack with plague or another zoonotic disease. Thes e types of incidents capture a ra nge of threats from localized, long-term contamination to large-scale events requiring a swift response. The goal will be to identify a set of concrete scenar ios that are amenable to quantitat ive risk analysis and exemplify the range of concerns co nfronting risk managers. The technical literature will be re viewed to identify modeling tool s and approaches to address the scenarios of concern to risk managers. It is expe cted that a suite of interconnected models will be identified that describe the different phenom ena associated with a bioterrorism incident including release, dispersion, e xposure, health effects, and sec ondary transmission. While basic methodological questions still exis t within the field, quantitative risk analys es are beginning to be feasible often using a set of modeling tool s borrowed from other domains such as food and water microbiology (see Haas 2002, or Casman, Fi schhoff et al. 2000, for example). At least initially, preference will be given to simple models (with analytical solutions if possible) as these are less computationally intensive and suitabl e for the general, non-site-specific modeling envisioned here. The selection of models will be coordinated through m eetings of the steering committee with the intent being to use the same models in this proj ect as the other CAMRA projects. The selection of fate and transport mode ls will be coordinated with Project I, secondary transmission models with Projec t II, and dose-response models with Project III. The objective will be to develop a single C-language computer program that can execute all of the selected models and pass information among them. When appropriate, reduced-form versions of the models employed by the other projects will be used in this project to reduce the computational burden. The suite of models will be us ed to integrate risks from the various domains in a dynamic, behaviorally realistic, inclusive framework, and will serve as the backbone of the integrated risk assessment. This model will enable the evaluation of a variety of risks associated with attack/mitigation combinations. Objective 2. Public Per ception of Bio-threat Risks The goal of this task is to understand how public perception of risk affects exposure and mitigative response behaviors by the public, and to identify key misunderstandings that could be corrected with targeted risk communications. The public respons e to a bioterrorism incident will influence the effectiveness of a wide range of supposedly \"technica l\" risk management decisions that rely on large-scale change s to the public's behavior (e.g ., evacuation, quarantine, mass- vaccination programs). For such measures to suc ceed, the public will need to be viewed not as bystanders who may hinder a response but as part ners in responding to an incident (Glass and Schoch-Spana 2002). 77 In crisis situations, many experts' first impulse is to tell citizens to go away while they figure things out. It is tempting, at some times, to ma gnify risks in order to motivate citizens. It is tempting, at other times, to trivialize their worr ies, with comparisons like \"why get so exercised about terror, when you're still smoking\" or \"onl y five people have died from anthrax [so far], compared with 40,000 annually from motor vehicl e accidents.\" The rhetorical tone of such comparisons puts many people off, especially wh en the options differ in other ways (e.g., benefits, costs, availability of alternatives). An academically discredited but still operational mi sconception is that people panic in times of crisis, behaving irrationally at th e individual and group level. This is often the unstated rationale for withholding bad news from the public. People may act on the basis of poor information, to their own detriment, but the problem is with thei r information, not with their rational processes (Glass 2001; Fischhoff, Gonzales et al. 2003; Tierney 2003) . Authorities who fail to disseminate the relevant information, or who misrepresent it, add to the collective distrust of authority and undermine their own abilities to influence behaviors. While the public reaction is not likely to be one of blind panic, there are indications that the public may not always cooperate with instructions they would likely receive in the event of a bioterrorism incident. Sometimes the public resp onse does not seem to be entirely rational. Lasker (2004) found that only 24% of the population would immediately comply with a recommendation to report to vaccination centers in the event of a sma llpox outbreak. Confused by their knowledge of pre-expos ure vaccination risks and benef its, the respondents were unable to compare these with the risks and benefits of post-exposure vaccination. The majority of the population (55%) said they would wait and collect information about whether or not to seek the vaccine. Identifying and addressing such public in formation needs beforehand will clearly aid in the timely and effective execution of a response. This is the kind of situ ation where timely and focused risk communication could decrease a dverse outcomes (i.e., increase the number of people protected by the vaccine). Non-cooperation with instructions is not always a matter of public misperception. In some cases the personal and societal goals are truly divergent. There are both private risks and aggregate (societal) risks and incentives for risk mitigating behaviors. When the incentives are aligned, the individuals act in accordance with the public good. When they are not, the individual may chose behaviors that increase societal risk. Exampl es of this from recent events include the 1994 pneumonic plague outbreak in Surat, India. Half a million Suratis fled that town within one week despite government efforts to restrict tr avel(Garrett 2000). Another example was the refusal of some healthcare personnel to treat SARS patients during the Toronto epidemics (Singer, Benatar et al. 2003; St raus, Wilson et al. 2004) out of f ear for personal safety or the safety of their families. In such cases, strate gies to harmonize incentives may be more successful than simple provision of information. In some cases, public non-compliance with govern mental directives may be justified. The federal program to vaccinate half a million healthcare workers and emergency responders against smallpox terminated well short of coverage goals. Once the previ ously unknown linkage between heart attacks and smallpox immunization became known and bioterrorism fears 78 decreased with the fall of Saddam Hussein (McNeil Jr. 2003), the national plan stalled at fewer than 40,000 vaccinations. The ration ale for rejecting pre-exposure vaccination was formalized in risk analytic terms by Meltzer w ho concluded that for a healthcare worker to accept pre-exposure vaccination, the risk for contact with an infectious smallpox case-patient must exceed 1 in 100 and the probability of there being more than 1000 initial cases must exceed 1 in 1000 (Meltzer 2003). The mental calculus of the health care work ers was informal, but it arrived at the same conclusion: \"reject pre-expos ure vaccination until the pe rceived risk is large\". Public perceptions of the risks of bioterrorism and of mitigation actions impact their compliance with response measures and ultimately impact the success of the mitigation efforts. Clearly there are many possible divergences between government al response plans and public responses to bioterrorism. Better understanding of these diverg ences and of ways to remedy them is essential for the development of effective response plans to bioterrorism incidents. However, systematic research is needed to achiev e this improved understanding. A. Analytical Framework This research will apply the \"m ental models\" research approach to understanding bioterrorism risks (Morgan, Fischhoff et al. 2002). The mental models approach uses the following procedure to understand public perceptions of technological risk: (1) Determine the knowledge most relevant to pr edicting the outcomes that matter most to citizens and formally represent this k nowledge in an influence diagram. (2) Empirically, determine what citizens know already. (3) Identify the most critical gaps3 In the mental models approach, people's unders tandings of risks are revealed using open-ended interviews and survey questions. The lay understa nding, or \"mental model,\" is then compared to a model of expert understanding. Identifying where the lay model differs from expert understanding helps to identify th e risk communication needs. The spectrum of potential bioterrorism incidents is wide. In keeping with the overall framework of this project, a limited number of scenario s will be explored in detail. The scenarios considered in Objective 2 will be a limited number of scenarios drawn from the set of scenarios developed in Objective 1. While it is possible to recalculate nu merical models of exposure and risk numerous times with different input paramete rs, eliciting information from the public is a labor-intensive process. For this reason it is expected that only two scenarios will be considered here. While the exact choice of scenarios will de pend on the results of Objective 1, one of the scenarios is expected to focus on post-attack building decontaminati on of anthrax. This scenario is of interest because no leve l of decontamination can guarantee zero re-occupancy risk. Workers may be asked to accept vaccination or to reduce their risk of future infection by some other method as part of a reoccupation plan. Given recent reactions to government plans for bioterrorism preparedness, it would be foolish a priori to assume complete compliance. Plans 3 The full mental models approach usually in cludes the development and testing of risk communication instruments for the specific audien ce. This phase is not part of the current proposal. 79 that extend to family members may be greeted with even more skepticism. Workers or other stakeholders must perform a ment al risk-risk comparison before de ciding on a course of action. Our research will explore the public perception of re-occupancy and risk management plans in an attempt to identify their most pressing information needs. The second scenario is expected to involve the widespread releas e of a transmissible pathogen, such as smallpox or a novel genetically modified pathogen. Many of the same issues considered in the first scenario will be considered here, such as willingness to co mply with governmental instructions, and the need for an informed risk-ri sk assessment of personal choices. In addition, this scenario may involve qua rantine measures, voluntary is olation, the distribution of prophylaxis, the closure of places of public asse mbly (including schools), etc. The public perception and response to these measures will be assessed. Percepti ons of members of the medical and emergency response communities will also be studied. B. Project Outline a. Development of the Expert Model and Influence Diagram In order to conduct a behaviora lly realistic risk analysis, our research process begins by creating a formal model of the processes cr eating and controlling specific risks. An example of this kind of analysis is found in Casman, Fischhoff et al. (2000). These models use the formalism of influence diagrams , which levels the playing field for contributors with different forms of know ledge, while still demanding the sort of rigorous thinking needed to reveal intera ctions, ambiguities, and uncertainties. CAMRA researchers in collaboration with out side experts, will construct influence diagrams of the factors contri buting to the risk of the tw o bioterror scenarios. In addition to the usual release, fate, trans port, exposure, and consequence features, these models will include concepts usually absent in risk assessments, such as control/mitigation strategies, time depe ndencies, feedbacks, heterogeneous populations, sensitive/sentinel populati ons, host immune status, information development and flow, monitoring results, technological constraints, individual choices in risk taking/avoidance behaviors, and institutional governance. For potential zoonoses (like plague) the diagrams will al so include disease dynamics in animals and insects, interactions with humans, and control efforts aimed at animal hosts. The diagrams serve as outlines onto which public perceptions can be mapped and compared. b. Identify affected population sectors The mental models analysis identifies th e knowledge crucial to informed lay person decision making. However, sectors of the public face different risks and have different reactions to the risks because of occupation, age, immune status, familial obligations, or other factors. Thus, the info rmation needs are likely to differ by target populations, reflecting the different decisions that they face. For example, first responders may need to know specific details about the most direc tly impacted sites, allowing them to prioritize their actions; the general pub lic may need to know more broadly which segments of society are affect ed in what ways, allowing them to make 80 the best sense of their circumstances, to in terprets officials' re commendations, and to identify personally relevant choices; indivi duals with certain medical conditions may need to understand yet a diffe rent set of details to enable them to compare the personal risks of action and inaction. c. Information needs Communication needs are determined by th e gap between what people know and what they need to know. Incorrect assump tions regarding people's beliefs may result in the failure to deliver needed facts in a comprehensible way, and can also undermine communicators' credibility. Provi ding information that people already grasp will lose their attention, while providing guidance that cannot be understood without a necessary baseline of knowle dge can result in the guidance being misconstrued or ignored. This procedure de scribed here is a systematic effort to avoid these pitfalls. The first step in this procedure is to identi fy critical decisions. The influence diagram will be reviewed and important decision variables identified. These may include personal decisions, such as seeking medical care, complying or not complying with governmental instructions, and institutional decisions such as when to issue warnings to the public, when to alert federal author ities, whether to mobilize drug stockpiles, what disinfectants to use, whether to in stitute pest control, when to institute quarantines and to whom they should apply, whom to treat, and how to handle triage of potential victims. This information will be used to inform Objectives 1 and 5, to make sure the models properly incorporate th e significant social variables. It will also narrow the focus of the analysis by identifying where decisions lead to risk relevant actions. The next step is to assess the baselin e knowledge of the target group concerning factors that would influen ce these critical decisions. For important population subgroups, we will conduct open-ended, semi-structured interviews, allowing individuals to express their own ideas in their own terms. This will allow us to ascertain how the public frames the problem. Interviews will be taped, transcribed and coded according to their relationship w ith the influence diagram. This is an objective way to represent baseline public knowledge and attitudes which will allow for the systematic identification of gaps between the expert model and the lay understanding. The comparison of the interviews and the e xpert model will also offer an opportunity to identify situations where public and private incentives are in variance. All such situations encountered in the interviews will be recorded and a summary list developed. In these circumstances, m easures beyond risk communication may be called for, such as the provision of appropr iate incentives to bring the private and public interests into line. The identifica tion of these situations by this research project will thus provide a basis for subsequent research into the design of response plans that reconcile public and private incentives. 81 d. Construct list of risk communication priorities The knowledge gaps identified by the analysis of the semi-structured interviews will then be prioritized. Not all misinformation is equally important to risk; the goal will be to identify those information gaps that ad versely affect critical decisions, so that these misconceptions may be targeted for future risk communication efforts. Thus, the end product of this task will be a list of key elements to include in communications with the public. This list of communication needs will inform both pre-event public education programs and post-event contingency plans. Fundamental misconceptions are best addressed before the event, given the limited timeframe and potential communications difficulties expected in an at tack. However, an analysis of pre-event knowledge and understanding will serve also to identify the public concerns likely to lead to non-compliance with governmental risk management plans and allow the design of post-event response plan s that address these concerns. e. Integrate with other CAMR A research activities. By illuminating the connection between public perception, behavior, and risk, this project has the potential to improve the prac tical usefulness of the results derived in other CAMRA projects. Systematically identifying behaviors that potentially increase or decrease personal risk will perm it these behaviors to be included in risk models (Objective 1). Behavior al choices represent an element of uncertainty in risk assessments, and explicitly incorporating them in the risk analysis gives a more realistic idea of the range of outcomes (O bjective 3) including be haviors that affect secondary transmission (Project II). Th is task will identify instances where the possession or absence of information influen ces risk. The value of such information can be quantified (Objective 4). Lastly , information on public risk perception and attitudes forms an important component of the educational curri culum of Project V that will help train risk managers in how to interact with the public Objective 3. Development of Probabilistic Descriptions of Uncertainty and Relatedness Probability distributions will be developed to desc ribe the uncertainty of input parameters with the potential to contribute substa ntially to model output uncertain ty. The potential of various inputs to contribute to uncertainty in model out puts will be assessed by the literature review (described above), and the uncertainty/sensiti vity analyses planned for the other CAMRA projects. Thus the literature review for fate a nd transport models will be conducted jointly with researchers on Project I and important uncertainties identified by Project I researchers will be included in the integrated assessment of this Project. An analogous process will be conducted with researchers from Project II (for seconda ry transmission models) and Project III (dose response models). All of these activities will be coordinated with Project V in order to identify key inputs for the knowledge and data repositories. It is expected that some input parameters will be fairly well defined (for example the dispersion coefficients for atmospheric transport under a given weather scenario) and may appropriately be desc ribed by point estimates. Many 82 other parameters will be subject to substantial uncertainty (e.g ., the dose-response functions for cutaneous anthrax and smallpox, Ra ber et al. 2001) and this projec t will seek to appropriately quantify the uncertainty in these estimates. Quantifying uncertainty in the domain of biote rrorism presents great challenges going far beyond issues of sample variability. For obvious reason s there is little information on the infectivity and environmental persistence of many bio-threat agents (Raber et al. 2001). It is common practice to use surrogate information where needed to fill in the inevitable data gaps in a risk assessment. For example, dose-response data from animal models are commonly used in place of human dose-response data. Unfortunately, classical statistical descriptions of uncertainty fail to provide useful information in such cases. In the cla ssical framework, the surrogate information is considered either completely representative of the quantity of interest or completely irrelevant. Bayesian hierarchical approaches provide a means to share information among related model parameters and even develop estimates for model qua ntities that have not been directly observed. In this framework, the parameters of the prior distributions describing initial uncertainty in the model parameters are viewed not as fixed valu es, but as random vari ables drawn from hyper- distributions. Parameters that are intrinsically related are modeled as deriving from the same hyper-distribution. For example, estimates of the dose-response model parameters for an infectious agent may be available for a vari ety of non-human animals, but a prediction and assessment of the uncertainty in the human value is required. The first st age of the model would be to specify a prior distribution for the mode l parameter of interest. For example, the r parameter from an exponential dose-response model could be modeled as: Ln (r i) ~ N (\u00b5, 2) where i is a subscript refere ncing species type, and \u00b5 and are the mean and variance of the distribution of r values across different species. Prior distributions for \u00b5 and are specified by the second stage of the model: \u00b5 ~ N (, S 2) 2 Ln () ~ N (m, s 2) where , S, m, and s are fixed hyper-parameters. In this manner, observations of r values for non-human species may be used to update estimates of \u00b5 and 2 and the resulting informed estimates of \u00b5 and 2 used to develop a predictive distri bution of r for unobserved species. Hierarchical modeling techniques are well established in the stat istical literature (see Lockwood et al. 2001 for an example application). Previous researchers in the fi eld of microbial risk assessment have developed hierarchical models of the variability of infectivity among Cryptosporidium strains (Messner et al. 2001, Teunis et al. 2002). These approaches are well suited to bio-threat agents for which there is ofte n little direct experiment al data on a wide range of characteristics including infectivity, persistenc e in the environment, and susceptibility to disinfectants, but where information on surrogate organisms or hosts may either be currently available or much more feasible to collect. Objective 4. Value-of-information calculations 83 Prioritizing among different research needs is a difficult task that involves balancing many different factors, such as: the extent of uncertainty in a given model parameter, the sensitivity of key model results to uncertainty in this parameter, and the potential for reduction in uncertainty in the parameter as a result of future research efforts. For example, the quantity of a bio- threat agent that is released is likely to be a highly uncertain variable, and model results are likely highly sensitive to this variable. However, this would likely not be a promising area for future resear ch because the release quantity depends on the capabilities and knowledge of terrorist organizati ons, topics for which additional research is unlikely to substantially reduce uncertainty. In contrast, the transport of bioterrorist agents, including their re-suspension into indoor air and susceptibility to different disinfectants is in many cases still uncertain. In this case, the parameters in question can be measured in laboratory experiments, and a carefully designed research program has to potential to make real contributions to reducing the uncertainty in model predictions. Given the inherent complexities of the task, effectively priori tizing among different research efforts requires a formal approach. Value-of-i nformation calculations, an established decision analytic technique (Clemen and Reilly 2001), provide such a means of prioritizing among different research efforts. In this approach , uncertainty distributions are fit to key model parameters. In addition, probability distributions are developed that reflect the reductions in uncertainty obtained by additional re search. In cases where preliminary data exists and one is simply augmenting the sample size, these di stributions can be de veloped by Monte Carlo simulations of the sample information obtained. In cases where the rese arch track is entirely novel, then it may be necessary to rely on subjecti vely elicited distributions of the value of the research results despite the cognitive and motiva tion biases to which such procedures may be subject (Morgan and Henrion 1990). In cases wher e subjective judgments are required, a variety of experts not associated with CAMRA will be recruited (similar to the procedure followed by Morgan and Keith 1995) and elicitation proce dures designed to minimize biases will be employed (Morgan and Henrion 1990, such procedur es expected to diminish but not eliminate biases). A decision problem will be constructed to model the options available to risk managers and the likely outcomes of their decisi ons both with and without th e information provided by the additional research. Informed in part by the public preferences elicited as part of Objective 2, a utility function will be assigned to a key model ou tput (or potentially outputs). The valuation of the information provided by the research will be assessed by the differences in the expected results of the scenarios with a nd without the information gained from the additional research (Clemen and Reilly 2001). An important feature of this valuation approach is that future research will be valued not di rectly for the reduction in scientific uncertainty achieved (an attribute perhaps more valued by researchers th an by the public) but by its relevance for aiding risk managers in deciding between the alternativ e risk management strategies to meet public goals and expectations. 84 Alternative allocations of research effort may th en be proposed, based on e ither the investigators' intuition or using formal optimi zation techniques, and the most promising allocation identified. The proposed work will be, to the best of our knowle dge, the first application of this approach to prioritizing research needs in the bioterrorism field and one of few attempts to apply this methodology to such a complicated set of interre lated models (see Dakins et al. 1996 for an example of applying value-of-inf ormation calculations to environmental remediation efforts). A priority will be to produce ini tial results in a timely fashion, such that useful input may be given to the teams responsible for the other pr ojects. For example, the results may help researchers on Project I to identify whether bett er knowledge of sensitivit y to disinfectants or better knowledge of re-suspension rates would be more useful to inform risk management decisions. To this end, initial results will be av ailable by the end of the second year in order to have time to substantively influen ce CAMRA's own research program. Objective 5. Implementation of results and iterative refinement of calculations The initial results described in Objective 4 will of necessity not be definitive. Instead, the analysis will be conducted in an iterative fashi on with successive refinements adding details to the evaluation, expanding its scope, and incorporat ing the latest assessments of the appropriate underlying modeling techniques and pa rameter uncertainties. This st rategy of iterative analysis can be considered a best practice for complicated decision and risk analyses that can never be performed in a definitive fashion but do benefit from the attempt to address them in a systematic, quantitative fashion (Morgan and Henrion 1990). Alternative mode l formulations, particularly alternate valuations of uncertainty reductions, wi ll be pursued throughout th e project in order to elucidate how their assumptions affect the conc lusions and recommendations of the evaluation. 3. Expected Results and Benefits This project is an ambitious attempt to unders tand and inform the societal response to bioterrorism risks. It will result in the creation of a novel and sophisticated decision model to understand bioterrorism impacts, as sess uncertainties, and prioritize research efforts. However, the goal is not model building for its own sake, but the creation of a set of key information summaries as outputs: A compilation and systematic representation of expert knowledge rela ted to bioterrorism in an influence diagram (Objective 2). A list of risk communication pr iorities for both pre-event publ ic education and post-event response plans (Objective 2). The identification of situations where public and private incentives are in conflict (Objective 2). This will pr ovide a basis for the design of response strategies that harmonize these incentives. The identification of key knowledge gaps and the prioritization of alternative research plans (Objective 4). 85 These results will provide practical guidance for important risk management decisions that must be made in preparation for and in response to a bioterrorism event. 4.

Project Organization This project will be a joint effort of Drexel and Carnegie Mellon that is closely integrated with the work of other CAMRA researchers. Elizab eth Casman, Mitchell Small, and Patrick Gurian 86 will collaborate on Objective 1 (identification of scenarios and modeling tools) using a consultative process involving i nput from a wide range of CAMR A researchers, including the steering committee and the lead investigators on the other four CAMRA pr ojects. Coordination with Projects I-III will ensure that this Project uses appropriate models for fate and transport, secondary transmission, and dose-response, resp ectively. Coordination with Project V will ensure that appropriate information is identifi ed for the knowledge and data repositories. The coding of an integrated model will be perf ormed by a Drexel doctoral student under the supervision of Patrick Gurian. Carnegie Mellon will have primary responsibility fo r Objective 2. Elizabeth Casman will direct the development of an appropriate expert model and influence diagram, and Julie Downs will direct the public perception rese arch. Subjects will be recruite d by a subcontractor specializing in public opinion research and interviewed over th e telephone by Carnegie Mellon researchers. Patrick Gurian will have primary responsibility for Objectives 3 and 4. Elizabeth Casman and Mitchell Small will assist with the development of probabilistic descriptions of uncertainty and the value-of-information calcula tions. The selection of key model input parameters and appropriate uncertainty levels will be coordinated with re searchers on Projects I-III. Coordination with Project V will ensure that key information identified during this task will be incorporated in the knowledge and data reposito ries. Model coding and implementation will be performed by a Drexel graduate student. The iterative refinement of the model (Objectiv e 5) will be directed by Patrick Gurian in consultation with Elizabeth Casman, Mitchell Sm all, the steering committee, and other CAMRA researchers. Input will be sought from other CAMRA research ers as to the appr opriate priorities for improving the scope and detail of the model (i .e., Project I researcher s would provide input on appropriate refinements to the fate and transp ort modeling effort, etc.). These refinements may involve the incorporation of novel results from other CAMRA projects, such as the elucidation of better dose-respon se models from Project III. 4.3. Schedule The activities of this project are concentrated into the first three years with the goal of having preliminary results available within the first two y ears. This will allow the priorities established by this research to influence CAMRA's own res earch prioritization. Figure IV.1 shows the project timeline. Objective 1 invol ves initial tasks to define the sc ope of the analysis, such as the development of attack scenarios, selection of appropriate mode ling tools, and coordination of scenarios and models with other CAMRA projects and will be completed in the first year. Figure IV.1. Project Schedule Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Objective 1 Objective 2 Objective 3 Objective 4 Objective 5 87 Work on public perception (Objectiv e 2) will also begin in the first year, including the pilot testing of an interview prot ocol, the identification of re levant population segments, the recruitment of subjects, and the fi rst set of interviews. In the second year, the remainder of the interviews will be completed, transcribed, a nd coded, and the analysis of the results will commence. The analysis of the results will continue into the third year and efforts to disseminate the results will begin. This will include the prep aration of a journal article on the findings as well as informal communication wi th other CAMRA researchers th rough the development of an educational program (Project V) and steering committee meetings. Work on Objective 3 will begin in the first year , as soon as sufficient progress has been made on Objective 1 to define the required model inputs. Objective 3 is scheduled to be completed by the end of the second year in order to allow preliminary value-of-i nformation calculations (Objective 4), beginning in the second y ear and becoming successively mo re refined throughout the third year. By the third year all the major pieces of th e analysis will be in pl ace and the emphasis will switch from building the modeling framework to iterative refinements of the framework (Objective 5) and disseminati on of results informally thr ough the CAMRA steering committee and formally through journal public ations and contributions to th e educational curriculum of Project V. 4.4.

Knowledge Manageme nt, Transfer, and Learning Leads: Dr. Rosina Weber & Dr. Ewen Todd 1.1 Objective: The understanding of elements involved in micr obial risk assessment (MRA) (Haas et al. 1999) and how they relate to each other as a body of knowledge has several societal benefits, particularly concerning developmen t of a biosecurity plan and an increase in the safety regarding the quality of food and water. It is the overall objec tive of this project to investigate and implement effective and efficient methods to enhance the understanding of microbial risk assessment as a body of knowledge. For this purpos e, we focus on education and collaboration in combination with technological methods to prom ote and leverage the management, transfer, and learning in this still novel field of study. There are several communities that can benefit from the knowledge in microbial risk assessment. Each having different purposes, backgrounds, and playing distinct roles in the process of learning about microbial risk asse ssment and applying its knowledge for improving the health, preparedness, and safety of our society. The first is the community of scientists involved in the various aspects of the evolving field of MRA, in cluding the core of CAMRA. The second is the public who has an interest the tools, information and application of MRA to their respective fields including policy makers , DHS members, EPA memb ers; technicians and managers in federal agencies, department of agri culture, health, education, energy, and defense. The final community is that of students in wh ich the education of th e next generation of microbial risk assesssors will be undertaken. Th e efforts to reach these communities in this project are categorized as t echnologically-oriented -- Techno logical Knowledge Management, Transfer, and Learning (TKM), public-oriente d -Communication CKM and finally education- oriented - Educational (EKM). The overall goal is to provide effective and efficient technological support for group collaborations, that result in a knowledge repository linked to a data repository, where knowledge can be discovered and leveraged, he lping to advance differe nt fields of study including programs in higher education and outreach to the community of professionals. This will include the ability to develop various science and knowledge-based approaches for integrating the type of data, mathematical mode ls, tools and other variab les for the advancement in the science, communication a nd educational programs for MRA.. Specific Objectives: 1. The Technical Knowledge Manageme nt, Transfer and Learning for CAMRA 1a. . Build an online repository based on evolving learning units. 1b. Reason with learning units for knowledge discovery. 1c. Build a data warehouse from data linked to the learning units. 2. The Communication Knowledge Management , Transfer and Learning for the Public. 2a. Develop CAMRA website and other means of dissemination. 2b. Develop a series of workshops for profession s who will utilize the MR A frameworks (eg.. to develop recommendations for policy to reduce the ri sk of transmission of se lect and other agents to populations in the U.S.) 3. The Educational Knowledge Manageme nt, Transfer and Learning for Students. 3a. Develop targeted courses (on-line) 91 3b. Develop summer workshop for graduate st udents and post-graduate associates 1.2 Technological Knowledge Manage ment, Transfer, and Learning (TKM) for CAMRA Collaboration is key to learning and sharing. It is how groups fi nd data, understand information, and create knowle dge. This project focuses on managing learning for the Center for Advancing Microbial Risk Asse ssment (CAMRA). CARMA scientists are dispersed across the country, posing the need for technologi cal support for collaboration among its members. Because its members shar e the same general goals and interests, CAMRA is a community of practice. The domain -specific artifacts in collaborations among CAMRA's members should be easily accessible to all group members. Data repositories create challenges for effectiv e retrieval and may hide valu able knowledge. Knowledge repositories are difficult to create and va lidate. How to support distributed group collaboration that results in data and knowledge repositories is not yet well understood. When knowledge learned through group collaboratio n is lost, the value of data is diminished and advancements are slow. An effective met hodology to support group collaboration that facilitates the semi-autom ated creation of knowledge in a ssociation with ex isting data can significantly leverage knowledge in a field and promote its sharin g throughout a large population. Our long-term goal is to prov ide effective and efficient te chnological supp ort for group collaborations, that results in a knowledge repository linked to a data repository, where knowledge can be discovered and leveraged, helping to advance di fferent fields of study. In this project, we will implem ent a collaborative framework that will support the semi- automated creation of a knowle dge repository linked to a data warehouse in the MRA domain for the CAMRA community. The knowledge repos itory will retain da ta in units of knowledge, henceforth referred to as learning units (LU). LU adopts a general knowledge representation formalism that can be further ta ilored. We will study the submissions of LU by CAMRA members to investigate its evolution into a specific format that is suitable to the MRA domain. This knowledge representation is based on lessons-learned (LL) (Weber, Aha, Becerra-Fernandez 2001). Lessons-learned have b een defined in differen t industries (id.) as a knowledge artifact that teac hes how to perform a task in an effective way. Our central hypothesis is that using an task-driven LU as the central instrume nt of collaboration will facilitate the creation of integr ated knowledge and data repos itories that pr omote knowledge leveraging and sharing. This hypothesis originates from th e recognition that usefulness stems from the applicability of a piece of k nowledge and that memb ers are motivated to contribute when they see the value of their effort. In order to further mo tivate CAMRA members, the PI of the TKM pr oject will visit all CAMRA sites to educate its members on the benefits of using the repository. This is expected to bring them the understanding re quired to motivat e contributions. The development of a colla borative framework cent ered on an task-drive n LU will result in a knowledge repository where more knowledge can be discovered a nd used in reasoning. The integrated data repository can also be used for knowledge discovery, as well as to build a database for public access. Th e explicit usefulness of LUs facilitate knowledge retrieval, 92 promoting knowledge sharing and leveraging. The systematic representation of the associations between knowledge and data will represent a framew ork for browsing that will also promote sharing. The knowledge repository will promote knowledge sharing and le veraging in two ways, as a powerful knowledge repository an d also in collaborati on aspects of its construction. The automated methods will help uncover unknown knowledge and inconsistencies between LUs, becoming yet other source s of knowledge sharin g. Finally, the data warehouse will be made available to the remain ing communities inte rested in MRA, and provide another platform for knowledge discovery. Given the aggregating role of this proj ect, it interrelates simila rly to all the remaining projects in this proposal. All leads and personnel working in a ll projects will be users of the knowledge repository. The TK M component is complementary to the EKM component (detailed later in this descript ion). The understanding produced by the educational efforts in EKM will be used in the design of the repository's task network and data warehouse. Project Four can immediately benefit kn owledge learned as automated methods may reveal gaps in MRA knowledge, which can be in vestigated in Project Four. 1.2.1 Approach: TKM Background Knowledge manage ment initiatives refer to knowledge repositorie s, knowledge access and transfer, and knowle dge environments (Davenpo rt and Prusak1998). Ou r focus is in the use of computational methods a re pository's storage and retrie val. Repository-based KM initiatives were surveyed by Weber, Aha, an d Becerra-Fernandez (20 01). KM repo sitories are distinguished by the knowledge artifact (H olsapple and Joshi 2001 ) they retain. They found the most widely used kn owledge artifact was lessons-l earned, whereas probably the most popular are best-practices. One of the c onclusions from this survey was that these systems posed challenges for thei r users, resulting less effectiv e than desired. Further study of technological, human, and managerial issues involving the use of lesson s-learned systems have indicated a number of re quirements that organizations and the supporting technology have to respect (Weber, Breslo w, Sandhu 2001). Th e study of collaborative learning (Stahl 2003) recommends design stra tegies for the organizational and technologica l support of successful knowledge sharing. The definition for LL evolved from different industrie s that adopted lessons-learned systems (Weber, Aha, Becerra-F ernandez 2001). To be cons idered lessons-learned, the knowledge artifact must include the specific task or process where it can be reused and the embedded lesson has to guarantee a positive impact to the target ed process. Af ter addressing specific technological impedime nts for knowledge sh aring, Weber and Ah a (2003) proposed a knowledge representation form alism for LL. This formalism en forces that LL requirements are met. The representation formalism for LL originated from the development of a methodology for the active distribution of le ssons-learned (Aha et al. 2001). This methodology - monitored distri bution (MD), relies on analogical reason ing for retrieving lessons. The underlying reasonin g methodology that su pports analogical retrieval is case- based reasoning (CBR) (Kolo dner 1993, Aha 1998). CBR is a reasoning methodology inspired by the human process of rememberin g a previous episode to solve a similar new problem. The act of being reminded of a pr evious episode is m odeled in case-based reasoners by comparing a new pr oblem with a collection of stor ed cases (the \"case base\"), 93 often based on indices describing the contents of the stored cases. The most similar cases are then retrieved, and the solution s from the retrieved si milar case(s) are adap ted to fit the new problem. A case-based re asoner stores situated experience s (cases) of performed tasks in a case library. Cases describe performed task s by having a description of a problem, a solution, and the result of applying the solu tion to the problem. Given the commonalities between cases and LL, their representation is mainly composed of three sub-modules: indexing components, reuse components, data components . Indexing components are responsible for facilitatin g retrieval; reuse components allo w the lesson's reuse; whereas data components keep track of a lesson's use. The LU being pro posed in this project is based on this lesson representation formalism. The direct benefit of using such a knowledge representation formalism is that it enables analogical reasoning. Other uses of computational intelligence methods have been suggested for re pository-based KM systems. The survey of intelligent lessons-learned systems (Weber, Ah a, Becerra-Fernandez 2001) describes some uses, which include knowledg e validation an d learning. In fact, adoptin g a formalism that allows the applicat ion of a reasoning methodology such as CBR extend the ava ilability of all technique s developed for CBR to the repository that retains LUs. Some examples of these methods refer to knowledge acquisition and maintenance. Another use of a CBR system is exemplified by CARMA (Branting, Hastings, Lockwood 2001). CARMA is de signed to provide expert ad vice on handling rangeland grasshopper infestations. CARM A helps users to devise polic ies on pest management and the development of industry st rategies. Within kn owledge maintenance methods that have been devised for CBR and that can be directly applied to leverage our understanding of a knowledge repository is the use of genetic algorithms (GA) (Craw, Jarmulak, Rowe, 2001.) and neural networks (NN) (S hiu, Wang, Yeung, 2001). One approach that is useful in immature domains, consists of ex tracting domain knowledge for a task such as classification and then ex amine how well the exis ting experiences can successfully classify new probl ems in comparison to domain kn owledge. Weber et al. (2003) applied a parameterized function that combines CBR with explan ation-based lear ning Pazzani, Silverstein 1991) to pe rform classification. Then, Webe r et al. (2004) investigated methods to identify va riations in data that could reverse a classification. The resulting predictions pointed to inconsistencie s, new knowledge, and new questions. A data warehouse (DW) is an environment that fac ilitates effective integration of traditional databases into an in frastructure that enables stra tegic use of data (Berson and Smith, 1997). A multidimensional database is required to overcom e limitations of the traditional relational database s (Kimball and Ross 2002). Mu ltidimensional databases can easily perform elaborate and complex queries by being coupled with On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) (Kimball et al. 1998; Pedersen & Jensen 2001). Goal 1: Build an online collaborative repository based on evolving learning unit Introduction. This project targets CAMRA' s community members, who are scattered throughout the country. To support their collaboration and learning needs, we will build a knowledge repository (K R) centered around an evolving l earning unit (LU) that identifies the task where it can be used. We expect to de liver a platform that w ill effectively promote knowledge leveraging and sharing among CAMRA members. This is an important element particularly in a novel domain like MRA where knowle dge is scattered, sparse, and mostly 94 implicit. The construction of this knowledge repository is critical to the advancement of the field of MRA and it also contributes to the fields of knowledge management and knowledge-based systems. Design. The knowledge repository (KR) will be built by all CAMRA scientists. Dr. Rosina Weber will visit every CAMRA institution to explain and educate CAMRA scientists about the use of the KR. We will build the KR using group collaboration principles. The KR will rely on an evolving LU. A hierarchical task network will organize the LU structure. We will visit CAMRA's members to educate them on how to use the KR about the po tential benefits of using it in order to motivate their contributions. This educatio n aims at motivati ng the community to collaborate by demonstrating the potentia l return to their own knowledge productivity, which is to be made transparent. Community members will be prepared to understa nd the goals of the knowledge repository and to unders tand all its operational processes. All members will be encouraged to provide feedback to guaran tee that the use of the KR is always beneficial. We will primarily focus on the unders tanding of the purpo ses of the reposito ry because it is understood that member s will not contribute to knowledge management efforts unless their benefits are transparent and perfectly understood. Following group co llaboration principles, scie ntists will be free to submit contributions in various privacy levels. Group submissions will be supported. We will encour age users to document their communications so we can use this data for further understanding. Access history is stored through lo g data for each access. We will have a knowledg e engineer examining the evolu tion of the repository and the particular adaptation needs fo r the LU to adjust it to the domain of MRA and CAMRA's members. After the LL concept, LU must iden tify its applicable task , in which it can be applied. We want to determine the specific elem ents in the LU consider ed ideal to represent knowledge in the MRA domain th at meets the needs of CAMRA scientists. Members of the community will be allowed to add and recomm end variations to the learning unit until we observe a reduction in the need for changes. For a scientific communi ty, one element is the rationale, stating the scientific grounds supportin g a LU (e.g., literature, statistical analysis). A task-oriented formalism can improve the recall levels of retr ieval but it is also beneficial to allow members to browse th rough these tasks. For these pu rposes, it is necessary that knowledge workers study the app lication domain for maintaining a hierarchical task network Figure 6. Addressing and Cont rolling Biological Agents 95 (HTN). A knowledge engi neer will study the structure of the HTN by findin g associations between different tasks described in the LU. Fi gure 2 shows the framew ork of processes for studying biological agents. These relations hips between processes imply relationships between specific tasks, which will be covered in the HTN. Hypothesis and Evaluation. Our working hypothesis is that th is knowledge repository will promote knowledge sharing an d leveraging throughout CA MRA's community. We will evaluate such hypothesis by recording the LUs that have been submitted by distributed members, LUs that have been submitted by on e member and modified by other, and LUs that have been submitted by on e member and then linked to another LU by another member. Goal 2: Reason with learning units for knowledge discovery Introduction. Technological supp ort for knowledge management goes beyond th e support for group collaboration. Th is goal will be met by using automated method s to promote further knowledge learning. Our hypothesis is that we can disc over knowledge in novel ways because our repository will have database records that represent knowledge. There are several ways to uncover knowledge from data records, but those do not explore the implied association within a piece of knowledge, i.e., a record that describes a task in a given context. The approaches we will adopt rely on computational intellige nce (CI) methods, e.g., genetic algorithms (GA) and neur al networks (NN). Because the learning unit is represented with a framework amenable to case-based r easoning, all methods developed for the CBR methodology can also be used in the knowledge repository. These studies will uncover knowledge and gaps in kn owledge that would be hardly atta inable by humans or when using traditional databases. Design. Learning algorithms su ch as GA and ANN can help us unders tand the knowledge repository by identify ing similarity measures, relative we ights representing the importance of distinctive features in a learning unit , redundant units, and representative units. Given the importance of the HTN, whic h includes browsing and reasoning, CI methods can be applied for its validation as well . Additionally, the use of inductive logi c to learn structures in data may lead us to uncover other relationships th at have not yet been captured. To use the repo sitory for reasoning , we will define measures to assess simila rity between LUs. Given a cluster of LUs that share similar problems, it is possible to select a library of units to perform reasoning task s. For example, a classificatio n task can be performed for identifying consistency of units describing ex periences and formal do main knowledge. The result can be the uncovering of knowledge previously unknown and also the identification of research questions. Some of these questions will be used to guide the design of the data warehouse in the following goal. Hypothesis and Evaluation. Our hyp othesis is that a re pository whose records meet criteria of a knowledge representation formalism can be used for reasoning tasks. We evaluate such a hypothesis by comparing the results we obtain wi th our methods on our repository's LU with results obtained in a database that does not use the LU's repr esentation formalism. 96 Goal 3: Build a data warehouse from data linked to the learning units Introduction. The knowledge re pository is limited to CAMR A members. However, it is necessary to make all the data gathered in the process of building the knowledge repository available for all th e communities involved w ith MRA. Once all this data is organized in a data warehouse (DW), it can be made available online an d yet additional kn owledge can be discovered with the use of data mining algorithms. The resultin g format of the LU will have data sources linked to one to many of its sub-components. Fo r example, the LU's rationale may have links to files and online links. This ob jective will be attained by the design and development of a DW, wh ich will take into acco unt the structure of li nks between the data and the KR, means for up dating the DW to follow up with the growing of the KR, and the design of methods for knowledge discov ery from data. Design. The DW will be design ed with three-tier architecture residing on a server at Drexel University. The first tier consists of various data sources that are geographically distributed in the US. The middle tier consists of data co nversion and model conversion. The third tier is web-based interface. Our data warehouse (D W) is connected to th e middle tier and the third tier, so that users can acce ss data in the DW a nd also directly from data sources with instant data conversion throug h the Internet. Semantic conflic ts among variou s data sources exist and they are solved in the middle tier. DW is designed with a multidimensi onal database. A multidimensional database is required to overcome lim itations of the traditio nal relational database management systems (RDBMS). Multidimensional da tabases are based on RDBMS, but they easily perform elaborate and complex queries by being coupl ed with On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP). The three-tier architecture also incl udes wrappers to extr act information from various data sources. The wrappers stay in the middle tier and are mainly responsible for data and schema conver sion to help users a ccess data directly in data sources. Metadata management is performed in data warehouse and includes data mapping, conversion, and summarization to store data in the data warehouse. Data volumes will continu ously grow and the data warehouse size will also rapidly grow. Multiple servers are required to implement a data warehous e with fast growing data volumes. Based on data usage patterns, data distribution is also necessary. To extract data from various data sources, a wrapper for each data source should be implemented. Each wrapper will semi-automatically extract data from a data so urce and a module in the middle tier loads, cleans, transforms, and migrates th e extracted data into data warehouse. To implement the data warehouse, both a relational database management system and an on-line analytical process tools are re quired. The middle tier has data mining modules to discover knowledge from data collected fr om various sources and data in the data warehouse in real time mode. Data mining is also performed in ba tch mode for non time-sen sitive app lications. The goal of data mining is to discover knowledge such as hidden relationships, patterns, or correlations from a collection of da ta. The DW will have a massive amount of data. It is hard to investigate manually the data in DW due to the excessive amount of data. Data mining can be used to perform clustering, classificatio n, find associations and correlations. Data mining can give results in real -time, and provide stra tegic value in time-s ensitive situations. Hypothesis and Evaluation. Our hyp othesis is that the proposed three-tier architecture for the DW will facilitate data organization and da ta access via Internet for geographically 97 distributed users. It will also provide seamless data interoperability among various data sources by providing wa ys to resolve semantic conflicts . The data mining module will provide knowledge that is hidden in massiv e amounts of data. We will evaluate our architecture by providing multidimensional conceptual view, tran sparency, accessibility, flexible reporting, multi-user support, and knowledge disc overy by data mining and measuring user satisfaction. We will also evaluate our syst em based on response time by measuring the time taken between user queries and the results. We can also evaluate the knowledge discovered by data mining techniques by sh owing them to domain experts. 1.2.2 Expected Results or Benefits: TKM As goals one and two are attained, we will ha ve the CAMRA community of members in the domain of microbial risk assessment (MRA) team that are familiar with submitting, retrieving, and reusing the proposed knowledge repository. CAMRA members will have benefited from its knowledge sharing and leveraging capabilities an d the technological supp ort for collaborative learning. The learning unit will have a stable representation specification, which is suitable to the domain and its users. A hierarchical task networ k will represent the main tasks and processes in the domain and how they interrelate and will be used to facilitate knowledge storing, retrieval, and reuse. The understanding of the field of MRA will have been enhanced. Learning units in the knowledge repository will embed the necessary understanding to create solutions to problems associated with MRA, such as environmental and public heath. As our third goal is achieved, all the commun ities involved with MRA will have online access to a complex database. Users can discover knowledge in real time and generate flexible reports and summary of a set of data from the data ware house. The knowledge in the field will be expanded further through data mining al gorithms uncovering MRA knowledge. The extension of its value can be only imagined as every citizen in the wo rld with Internet acce ss and understanding of the English language will be able to learn about environmental problems, improving the public's ability to protect the environment and human health.. 1.3 Communication Knowledge Management, Transfer, and Learning (CKM) to the Public Enhanced concern over the need for protection of water, f ood and the environment from terrorist agents of a microbial nature has prompted an urgent need for experts to cope with such contamination and to determine th eir potential risks to the U.S. population. Currently, the U.S. is faced with a lack of expertise in microbiologic al risk assessment (MRA) for agents transmitted by food, water and air, both from natural and deliberate sources, and there are few academic programs targeted to address this shortage. In addition there is no es tablished framework in which the community of users of assessments could apply the cu rrent sets of data, tools and models. CAMRA will be dedicated to providing meaningful and active communication and learning experiences for those in biosecurity. Th is will be addressed through collaboration with other DHS centers for example (post-harvest fo od protection and defens e and foreign animal diseases) and creation of linka ges with other successful, but presently independent, programs delivered by universities, associa tions and private contractors. 98 1.3.1 Approach to CKM Goal 1: To develop an in tellectual knowledge base An intellectual knowledge base will be form ed, that public entities will have access to. This will address the integration of fields of security, water and food supply, environment and public health, with a special focus on microbial risk assessment and sel ect agents. The initial database will be strong on the water/food supply chain models and it will take longer to build up the information on the select agents. This nucle us of intellectual reso urces will be initiated within the consortium but eventually will create a nationwide learning community with additional expertise from other academic and govern ment units as required to respond to the meet EPA and DHS objectives and the continua l changing need for education for government and industry professionals. This wi ll include representatives of the other DHS centers (Table ) Goal 2: To develop CAMRA webs ite and other dissemination means A CAMRA website will facilitate access to de veloped resources. This needs to be input by agent, means of delivery (e.g ., air, water, food), current ri sk assessment information (e.g., dose response and exposure data), different fram eworks for management approaches. This information will be shared with the learning community for evaluation, enhancement and development strategies. Other ways to engage public participants interested in application of MRA may include listserv s, and bulletin boards. Goal 3: To develop a series of CAMRA workshops Each CAMRA member belongs to any one of a number of professional organizations that provide opportunity for comm unicating CAMRA research and assessments to professional colleagues in a variety of arenas. Normally pre-conference or conference workshops can be developed and submitted, thus reaching a number of different disciplines and potential impacting the community of practice by various types of prof essions, which could then begin to incorporate the principals of MRA. CAMRA plans to design a series of workshops that can be presented by CAMRA scientists at a variety of meetings such as: American Society of Microbiology, ASM BioDefense Research Meeting, American Public Health Association, American Water Works Association, Institute for Food Technology, So ciety for Risk Analysis, Water Environment Federation. In addition, workshops can be tailored speci fically toward EPA and DHLS scientists. These may be held directly at EPA research facilities or at MSU facilities. 1.3.2 Benefits of CKM Risk assessments are not ends in themselves but are a part of risk management strategies for controlling or reducing the impact of diseas es of concern. Such assessments depend on the specific questions asked by the managers. So, th ere has to be dialog between assessors and managers to agree on the most a ppropriate questions and the avai lable information and resources to accomplish this. Risk assessments are increasingly being used to influence existing policy for a specific agency, e.g., the FDA/FSIS Listeria m onocytogenes risk assessment in the U.S. (2003) or as guidance to set policy for any country, e.g., the FAO/WHO also for L. monocytogenes (2004). Thus this program will allow professi onals to obtain research data, utilize that 99 information to assist in the development of recommendations for policy to reduce the risk of transmission of select and other ag ents to populations in the U.S. It is hoped that in response to an event, work with Risk Assessment and Public Health Cores to develop educational strategies to support response and recovery activities can be undertaken. 1.4 Educational Knowledge Management, Transfer, and Learning (EKM) 1.4.1 Introduction Clearly one of the main comm unities CAMRA would like to reach is the graduate student population and post-doctoral research scientists th at will be supported by the Center as well as any involved with the investigators at each Un iversity. CAMRA will support up to14 students as well as 6 to 10 post-doctoral scientists. Th ese individuals will form the CAMRA educational consortium of students for the study of MRA Mission . The Education Core will facilitate the transl ation of research into practice, policy and response. This will occur through the development and dissemination of education programs, the integration of best practices a nd cutting-edge methods into academic course materials, and the development of platforms for creating virtual training programs incorporating courses from university collaborato rs within and beyond the consortium. 1.4.2 Approach Core Description. The Education Core combines some of the nation's most prominent educators in the agriculture, food science, veterinary medi cine, and public health disciplines to create a team that can work across the food chain to promote microbial risk assessment. Core Activities: Task 1: Review research activities with project le aders and work groups to identify material that can be incorporated into just-i n-time and academic training courses Task 2: Initiate institutional processes to facil itate seamless transfer of academic course credits between institutions. Initial core locations and members: EPA DHS and other interested stakeholders. Task 3: One semester online course: The on lin e version will use trai ning modules along the lines of the MSU NFSTC Pro MS distance learning course, and cove r the latest developments in risk microbial assessment through computer access and instructors via the web or online. It will allow demonstration of all the detection, modeling, and quantita tive risk assessment tools, and have three layers: Layer 1 will be focused on novices and administrators; Layer 2 will target graduate students interested in getting the trai ning so they can begin to use the knowledge to do research; and Layer 3 will be ge ared towards the experts or wo rking professional planning to become experts or increase their knowledge. It will be team-taught through modules by all the Center participants and other experts. By accumu lating research and educational materials from a collection of risk assessment experts throughout th e world, administrators , graduate students and others would be provided with the knowledge needed to combat suspected or actual contamination events. The flexibility of the onlin e environment allows participants to receive this information without sacrificing other co mmitments. Additionally, the online environment permits the inclusion of the latest news and updates in microbial risk assessment. 100 There are a number of other programs and appro aches that will be discussed. For example the \"Development Multi-day internati onal workshops at the expert le vel\". This program would be designed as a forum for provi ding and gathering the latest research, technology and developments on microbial risk assessment to generate information to be put into courses/programs, along with contacts with expert who could contribute to these. Consortium members would serve as the hosts for international gatherings of experts and guest presenters. This approach is based on the Te xas A&M Food Irradiation workshop held in April 2004. One could also develop a Project-driven Graduate to Post-doc visitation program in multiple settings. This would allowing advanced students the opportunity to work side-by-side with experts in the field of microbial risk as sessment, the project-drive n visitation program puts students in a position to learn from the best in an active, focused manner on multiple campuses. By collaborating in research th rough a project-driven approach , students can participate in a semester-long program at host universities. Thr ough collaboration with grant-funded university partners students will seek fellowships to allo w them opportunities to spend several months at each of the participating institutions working with the experts to learn and develop strategies for microbial risk assessment in different scenarios, e. g., water, food, air, person to person and with different organisms 1.4.3 Expected Results or Benefits: EKM Critical to the protection of our nation's water, food and environmental infrastructures is the development of educat ional resources and expe rts enabled to react during a potential or ongoing cris is or to plan ahead for introducing strategies to anticipate risks. By utilizing a variety of educational methods, MSU, Drexel Un iversity of Arizona and University of California Berkeley are fulfilling their role as leaders in countering terrorism and risk assessment, but these need to be comb ined to allow to educat e the next generation of scientists on the sc ience, methodologies and applications of MRA. CAMRA is committed to fulfilling the EPA's and DHS's mandates to meet the need for protection and defense. Such a challenge requi res evaluation and strategic planning never before undertaken. Severa l initiatives are required: 1. To build educational progra ms around existing programs su ch as enteric pathogens in water/food scenarios, inte grating supply-chain management, economic and health assessments, detection and diagnostic needs, and public health concerns. 2. To tap disciplines such as agriculture, cr iminal justice, engineering, epidemiology, food science, microbiology, ma thematics, public health, ve terinary medicine, and water research, to increase th e number and diversity of students and trainees. Recent examples of this effort are: a. The MSU Online Prof essional Master of Science (proMS ) in Food Safety Degree Program accepted 31 students du ring its first two years with a proj ected enrollment of 50 in 2004. b. In September 2004, the MSU School of Criminal Justice received a $3 million grant from the DHS's Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness to help law enforcement agencies across the nation gather and manage info rmation, and specifically to develop a program to help more than 1,100 local, state and tr ibal law enforcement officials as they seek to pr otect the public. c. The MSU School of Crimin al Justice, in collaboration wi th colleges across campus, has launched a three-course online certificate pr ogram that allows working professionals and 101 graduate and undergraduate stud ents to add a specialization in homeland security to their career or academic plans. d. The Michigan Department of Agricult ure and the Michigan Veterinary Medical Association are all part of the Michigan Emer gency Veterinary Networ k, or \"Vet Net,\" an integral part of Michigan's ho meland security efforts in th e animal health and protection arena. Vet Net is made possibl e by DHS and MSU College of Ve terinary Medicine funding. The program includes two main components: a general education series fo r all veterinarians and an in-depth emergency preparedness training program for those who sign up to serve in the \"corps.\" e. MSU is a part of the Minnesota-led Univer sity Center for Post-Har vest Food Protection and Defense, sharing a three-year, $15 million gran t from DHS to improve agro-security, including developing bio-sensors that can detect anything from anthrax to botulism, and radio frequency identification (RFID) tags that can help track pa ckages, as well as vulnerability assessment for supply chains, and the education program. The base of these programs should include th e general principles of microbiological risk assessment as follows: 1. Microbiological Risk Assessment should be soundly based upon science. 2. There should be a functional separation be tween Risk Assessment and Risk Management. 3. Microbiological Risk Assessmen t should be conducted according to a structured approach that includes Hazard Identification, Hazard Characte rization, Exposure Assessment, and Risk Characterization. 4. A Microbiological Risk Assessment should clea rly state the purpose of the exercise, including the form of Risk Estimate that will be the output. 5. The conduct of a Microbiological Risk Assessment should be transparent. 6. Any constraints that impact on the Risk Assess ment such as cost, resources or time, should be identified and their possible consequences described. 7. The Risk Estimate should contain a description of uncertainty and where the uncertainty arose during the Risk Assessment process. 8. Data should be such that uncertainty in the Risk Estimate can be determined; data and data collection systems should, as far as possible, be of sufficient quality and precision that uncertainty in the Risk Estimate is minimized. 9. A Microbiological Risk Assessment s hould explicitly consider the dynamics of microbiological growth, survival, and death in the different envi ronments (water, food, air) and the complexity of the interaction between hu man and agent following consumption in causing disease (including sequelae) , as well as the potential for further spread. 10. Wherever possible, Risk Estimates should be reassessed over time by comparison with independent human illness data. 11. A Microbiological Risk Assessment may need reevaluation, as new relevant information becomes available. CAMRA will be focused on knowledge, communicati on and learning that will take train the scientists of the future in MRA methods and research which will aid in further enhancing frameworks that will be useful for recommendations for policy to reduce the risk of transmission of select and other agents to populations in the U.S. 102 1.5 General Project Information 1.5.1 Personnel and Management : The project will be overseen by Dr. Rosina We ber (Drexel) for all activities relating to knowledge management for CAMRA and By Dr. Ewen Todd for all knowledge management for the public and educational community groups. Each will be supported with a team but will have significant interactions with teams at each university in addition to Project teams. There will be significant discussions directly with the ESI team. The College of Information Science & Technolo gy at Drexel University represents a unique combination of expertise in the areas of know ledge management, computational intelligence, databases, collaborative learning, and human-computer interaction. Dr. Rosina Weber will be overseeing all aspects of the repository data base, knowledge discovery and lessons learned for the CAMRA scientists and colleagues who are specifically involved in MRA methodology. Dr. Michael Atwood's will be involve d in the development of interactive systems and expert systems, software engineering process improveme nt, software project management, and software product development. Dr. Hyoil Han's interest w ill be in the merging of techniques from the areas of databases and artificial intelligence; including databases, data mining, stream data mining/management, machine learning techniques , relational learning, bioinformatics, and information extraction. Dr. Ewen Todd will lead in the development of web sites for the public domains, oversee the educational programs and address the interactions with EPA and DHLS. In addition, He will work directly with Dr. Rose to establish the set of workshops and work via the ESI to establish a graduate level curriculum. He will be assisted with the hiring of a Post-doctoral scientist with the expertise in MRA and computational programs. 1.5.2 Facilities : College of Information Science & Technology (IST), Drexel University Laboratories: Computing Support for Research-d edicated facilities. IST houses two newly renovated research facilities that have subs tantial computing facilities. The Knowledge Management Collaboratory (KMC) contains 15 PC P3-700 workstations with flat panel monitors and connected by a mixed wired and wireless netw ork, a SmartTech smart board rear projection unit, and an InSight controller. The KMC is supported by an IBM NetFinity dual P3-700 server with 2 gigabytes of RAM (upgradable to 10) and a maximum 360 gigabyte storage capability. A UNYSIS server with 1-2 gigabytes of RAM and 720 gigabytes maximu m storage capacity is also online. This provides an excellent facility in which to study collaborative design. The Usability Laboratory contains 6 PC computers, a Panasonic front projection unit, and a mirror for observation of participants in expe riments. This provides an excellent facility in which to verify the usability of systems developed in research projects. Two more laboratories are of exclusive use of graduate students. All work stations in all these labs are ne tworked via Ethernet and utilize 2 high-end servers currently running Windows NT 4.0 Server for print and file services. Software. The University and College hold licen ses for a range of research-related software, including standard statistical packages, Web-au thoring tools, and vari ous graphics software. Specifically for this project, we will build th e knowledge repository using PHP and MySQL, 103 which are free and extremely reliable. For the da ta warehouse, we must purchase a license of Oracle so we can use its data warehousing capabi lities to be efficient and less prone to error. Computer. Computing services in IST support general college administrative and service functions, classroom instruction and student work , and faculty teaching and research. This PI has one workstation located in her office, one laptop for her use, and one laptop being used by her and students working under her supervision. These are th e respective configurations. 1). Dell Optiplex IBM ThinkPad T41p 2373-Pentium M wireless antenna, Cache Memory 1 MB-L2 cache:RAM 512 MB (installed)/2 GB disp hard drive Major equipment. The major equipments to be used in this project are the new workstation to be purchased, the computers in the KMC, and this PI's computers. Secretarial. IST provides good secretarial suppor t that includes work-study students. These students are allocated on a term basis. Connectivity. The entire College building is Ethern et networked with a cap acity equivalent to a T1 line, feeding off of a campus wide T3 bac kbone. Drexel is also a wireless campus (802-11B wireless network) with each building containing from 1 to 5 transceivers. Students and faculty have full laptop wireless access to the entire ra nge of university services, any place, and any time. Drexel and Penn both use the new Internet2 connection to the Internet, permitting extremely fast connectivity and the ra pid transfer of very large files. MSU Facilities The NFSTC has a 3-story 115,000-sq. ft. building with laboratories for res earchers with expertise in toxicology, carcinogenesis, pathology, analy tical chemistry, microbiology, epidemiology and the social sciences. It is also the location of outreach and education programs, seminars and workshops. It is also the home of the newly created Food Safety Policy Center. Thus, this is a suitable building to conduct seminars and works hops relating to risk assessment and how these can interact with research and policy. As semina r room with room for up to 40 participants with computers is available for these. Courses/worksh ops conducted there will be modified for taking to other locations and involvi ng other consortium members. The post-doc with expertise in MRA, will develop courses along with the experts from the other consorti a under the direction of Dr. Todd. Dr. Todd will also coordinate the MRA e ducational activities with those arising out of the DHS NCFPD coordinated by Dr. Ed Mather who is Deputy Direct or of the NFSTC. 104 1.5.3 Time frame Table V-1.

Microbiology/Chemistry Interests Elizabeth Casman's research concerns the interactions between social, environmental, institutional, and technical factor s in human disease, both in the contexts of the epidemiology of diseases linked to climate change and of biot errorism surveillance and response. She is also interested in water resource issues (including water quality, quantity, and drinking water security) and regulatory policy fo r genetically modified organisms. Since coming to Carnegie Mellon, she has specialized in integrated assessment models of infectious disease epidemiology, building numerical models that incorporate social, technological , and economic variables into contagion models, and has co-edited a book on the c ontextual determinants of malaria. She is also interested in the meaning of mixed levels of uncertainty in complex models and has helped develop a risk analytic tool th at relies on bounding analysis. The main focus of her bioterrorism work is the early detection of covert attacks, particularly in regards to technological limitations, and more recently, preparedness and risk communication.
