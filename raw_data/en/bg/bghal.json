New Offerings by Established Businesses and Practitioners The return of warm air to Michigan heralds a brand new season of outdoor adventures, family vacations, and new memories. Long-time friends Sue Valiquett and Kate Lazuka were inspired to write and illustrate a new children's book, \"The Rock People,\" after combing Northern Michigan's rocky beaches together on a family vacation, where they discovered that some of the rocks had faces. The story follows a little girl named Nae-Nae on her family's summer vacation to their lake house, where she, too, discovers the rock people and \"their message to heal and protect the earth,\" according to Sue, the book's author, and Kate, who contributed photographs and digital illustrations to the story. At a family picnic at Peterson Park in Northport, Michigan, during a trip to the Leelanau Peninsula about five or six years ago, Sue and Kate decided to pull a random Native American prayer out of a deck of cards that they had brought along. \"We happened to pick a card about respecting all of earth. It talked about respecting the two-legged and the four-legged, those who can swim, insects, birds and the rock people, as well. We didn't pay too much attention to the rock people at the time, but we read the prayer,\" Kate remembers. Later, while exploring the peninsula's rock-scattered shore, they started noticing that some of the rocks seemed to have facial expressions naturally etched on their surfaces. The pair brought many of the rock people home with them. They had a feeling that they would use them for something one day; however, they juggled around a few ideas over the next several years, including greeting cards. They decided to send a portfolio of photographs Kate had taken of rock people to Andy Azula of the Martin Agency, who appears in UPS's dry-erase board-themed commercials. He enjoyed the cute, little characters and agreed to meet Sue for coffee and feedback. \"The best question he asked me that day was 'Why should people care about the rock people?' The question really got us asking, 'Why have the rock people presented themselves to us?' I decided to go back to the roots of it, which is (the Native American prayer) that the rock people are here to protect and heal the earth.\" Sue's professional background as a clinical dietician does not have much to do with writing a children's book. Before writing \"The Rock People,\" Sue had written scientific, technical analyses about nutrition, but this is her first creative work. However, Sue does like to journal. One day, she sat down with her journal and imagined her herself back at Peterson Park on the day she and Kate stumbled upon the rock people. \"I visualized myself sitting on a log at Peterson Park, talking to the rock people and being quiet enough to hear why they are here. I journaled what I felt I heard. What I heard was their legend, which became the centerpiece of the book,\" Sue explains. Kate is a photographer and digital collage artist, and she contributed mostly black and white digital illustrations to the book. The images feature original photographs that Kate PhotoShopped into each scene. Many of the illustrations \"look like straight photographs that are manipulated a little bit,\" Kate explains. The living likeness of the fictional character Nae-Nae is actually Sue' s daughter, Renee, when she was little, whom they called Nae-Nae. Kate snapped photos of her 14 years ago, on another occasion the two families were vacationing on the Leelanau Peninsula. In the middle of the book, when Nae-Nae' s mother tells her their family legend about the rock people, the story's pictures change to bright full-color illustrations, offsetting the legend from the rest of the tale like a vignette or a dream sequence in a film. Ultimately, \"The Rock People\" is a fictional tale about becoming aware of one's own responsibility to protect the earth and the environment, filtered through two friend's personal reflections on \"what the rock people are trying to communicate to us.\" They are pleased to share Nae-Nae's family's story, and their own, in their new book. Like the rock people, the book reminds us all \"to live gently with Earth.\" Find out more about \"The Rock People,\" an eco-friendly children' s book, online at www.therockpeople.net. You can purchase copies of the book at Crazy Wisdom, and on their website, and on their website you can also purchase rock people t-shirts and other merchandise.

(See page 8)The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 7 Continued on page 8What 's New in the Community A virtual slew (or would it be a virtual stew?) of holistic practitioners have joined forces at the new Center for Sacred Living, located at 210 Little Lake Drive #7. The director of the original Center for Sacred Living , Tiffany Mazurek (a psychotherapist, massage therapist and craniosacral therapy practitioner), is bringing a number of practitioners from the former center along with her, to the new space. Also, From Within Health Center has merged with the Center for Sacred Living, adding two new co-directors into the mix: chiropractor and aller gy specialist Robert Koliner, who uses the NeuroModulation Technique; and his cohort, Carey Ryan, who practices acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine, as well as the NeuroModulation Technique. The three co-direct the space, but they are also renters. Rob says; \"No one is the boss.\" Both Tiffany Mazurek and Rob Koliner had \"envisioned having a center with a lot of different practitioners working together,\" in Rob's words. When Tiffany's business partner, Abby Humphrey, decided to leave town, she began looking into moving the Center for Sacred Living into a new space. Carey Ryan had also a professional relationship with Abby, and spent some time working at the old space on Hogback Road, further linking the two centers. The space is also the new home of the Great Lakes Center for Healing Touch, led by Char Hatlen (Healing Touch practitioner, massage therapist, and registered nurse), who previously worked out of the old Center for Sacred Living. Energy worker Becky Hackenberg and Abby Humphrey (who is an acupuncturist and Chinese herbalist) - both of whom were former co-directors of the original Center for Sacred Living -- don't live in Ann Arbor anymore; however, they work out of the space about once a month. Other alumni in the new space include: Karlta Zarley, a nurse and a medical intuitive who utilizes a variety of healing modalities, including Healing Touch, Color Therapy, and spiritual direction; Diane Thal Gluck, who offers healing techniques, allergies antidotes, and Emotional Freedom Technique to clients in- Optometrist Dr. Joyce Takahashi (See page 9)Long-time friends Sue Valiquett and Kate Lazuka were inspired to write and illustrate a new children's book, \"The Rock People,\" after combing Northern Michigan's rocky beaches together on a family vacation, where they discovered that some of the rocks had faces. (See page 7)person and at a distance; Polarity therapist Cindy O'Connor; Donna Davison, a psychic and clairvoyant healer Glenn Pailthorp. Carol Ann Spalteholz, who had been a renter in the former space used by the From Within Center , is also coming to the new Center. Her massage and Reiki business is called Relax and Renew . There are also additional folks who are joining the fray, including Life Coach Tamara Sutton, an energeticist and consultant on \"Personal Restoration\" and coping with grief; and recent massage graduate Sue Schoenberg, who plans on using Hot Stones in her practice. The new Center for Sacred Living is concerned with maintaining a healthy, earth-conscious space. There is environmentally friendly paint on the walls, which contains zero volatile organic compounds that could have agitated clients who are sensitive to chemicals and smells. There will be no \"new car smell\" in their new location. So far, this veritable Brady Bunch of holistic practitioners is working together smoothly. \"I think everybody has seen a new flow of energy to his or her practices,\" Tiffany says of her experience working in the new space. The new center features a series of comfortable studios that the practitioners share, as well as a nice-sized classroom space that is perfect for group classes, special events, and individual practitioners who want to spread out while they work. Having everyone working out of one space also creates a rich network of inter -referrals between the practitioners. Visit the Center for Sacred Living online, at www. centerforsacredliving.com. Keith and Donna Copeland envision taking their martial arts school, Quest Martial Arts, in ambitious new directions. Their vision includes expanding the dojo and creating an \"institute\" where a wide variety of practitioners and teachers can offer anything from acupuncture, to life coaching, to after school tutoring sessions all under one roof. They are also concerned with reducing their impact on the environment, and plan to install solar panels on the dojo' s roof. Keith reports that the dojo has experienced \"explosive growth over the last 18 months.\" He estimates that enrollment in the academy has increased by \"at least 20%\" over this time period. He hypothesizes that there may be more demand for youth and adult activities that teach \"tangible skills, and build character ,\" and encourage \"personal growth,\" than in the past. However, \"right now, we are restrained by our square footage,\" he explains. Keith and Donna are currently looking into options to make the dojo bigger, perhaps by eventually expanding into another unit within the same shopping plaza, at 2111 Packard, or looking at other \"potential spaces\". An expanded dojo would offer more than martial arts training. Keith, who is trained in American ninjutsu style To-Shin Do and other types of martial arts, had a vision to create \"an institute\" where other practitioners could rent out space, even before he and his wife founded the school, in 1999. Keith and Donna envision adding \"breakout rooms\" and meeting spaces where other practitioners can meet with clients, host groups, or teach classes. Such a space would also be perfect for unemployed and underemployed schoolteachers to meet with students for after school tutoring sessions and after school classes. The Copelands already keep their dojo green and environmentally conscious. As they grow, so will their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint. The dojo already uses green cleaners made by the Shaklee Corporation, and takes other measures to reduce energy consumption and minimize their carbon footprint, from the types of light bulbs they use to how soon in each new season they turn on the heat or AC. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 8 Continued from page 7They are working on transitioning to solar power. Keith hopes that the addition of solar panels to the dojo's roof will \"encourage as many other businesses as possible to take a serious look at it,\" he says. He remembers, \"Back when I was 17 or 18 in the 70's, solar and alternative energy was a really new and big thing. There was an industry that started around it but it never went very far, it kind of died out. In fact, my dad moved to Tennessee and he wanted to have a solar home. He got everything set up and the businesses went out of business, and he didn't have the expertise himself.\" In 2010, Keith is finding the transition to solar power much easier, as well as affordable, due to state and federal tax credits and incentives that are being offered by DTE, which significantly reduce the cost of the equipment. Donna, who abhors violence, explains that \"we really believe that self-defense and self-protection is more than just defending yourself against someone on the street,\" which is why the dojo encourages \"environmental self-defense,\" she says. The dojo teaches students that violent self-defense should be \"a last resort,\" Donna says. Beyond offering martial arts instruction, Keith and Donna also have a background working as human behavior consultants for businesses and lar ge corporations. They put that experience into play at the dojo, by creating \"a life skills laboratory,\" where students can grow as people and better relate to others. One way that people can defend themselves is by working on what Keith calls \"your relationship with yourself,\" which helps you better understand how you relate and respond to other people. Donna reminded me that someone they already know assaults most people who are physically attacked. Beside teaching martial arts, the Copelands hope to teach their students to be more mindful of their own personalities and the types of relationships they choose, \"so they can stand up for themselves in appropriate ways\".

Contact the school by phone, at (734) 332-1800, or email questcenter@sbcglobal.net Optometrist Dr. Joyce Takahashi does not particularly identify herself as a \"holistic\" practitioner, but her approach to Vision Therapy and patient care keeps the mind-body connection in mind. She opened her private practice, Takahashi Eye Care, a few years back, after spending the better part of two decades growing pediatric care as a partner at Bennett Optometry. With 25 years of clinical experience behind her, she provides general primary eye care to patients of all ages, with a special interest in visual development during childhood and experience working with patients af fected by closed-head injuries and brain traumas. Depending on the patient, Joyce uses treatments like eyeglasses, prism therapy and corneal refractive therapy contact lens, among other techniques. She reports that, in many cases, temporary use of these therapeutic prescriptions can reduce the need for life-long eye glasses or prescriptions that just keep getting stronger and stronger over the years, especially in her work with children whose eyesight is still developing. In some cases, Vision Therapy's tools can present alternatives to more invasive treatments like sur gery, according to Joyce. For example, \"In a child who has an eye turn, traditionally it is that you do surgery on the eye muscle to make it cosmetically straight. Surgery would do that, but what it doesn't do is teach your brain how to use those eyes together. Just because you make the eye look straight and cosmetically aligned doesn' t mean the brain can now take those images and be able to use them together ,\" she says. Joyce agrees with a statement I made to her that \"the body has its own wisdom to heal itself.\" For example, she says that, \"Vision Therapy teaches the system how to do it better, with less effort. In the sense of wisdom, it becomes a part of what you do by nature. The body wants to work efficiently and I think it has the inherent wisdom to do that.\" Joyce is also concerned with \"environmental\" and \"behavioral\" factors that impact our eyesight, and shares a nugget of wisdom about how extended computer use can cause \"eye fatigue.\" Eye fatigue can cause a range of problems, including a slowing of our blink reflex. \"Tear film is critical for the health of the surface of the eye and your vision. When your eye gets too dry, you don't see well,\" she elaborates. When your eyes start to water, what comes out \"are not good tears,\" but rather \"reflexive\" tears that are not lubricating and do not protect against infection like our natural tears do. Joyce recommends the \"20 / 20 Rule,\" which says you should look up from your computer or your book for 20 seconds, every 20 minutes.

He was recently certified in Central Channel Clearing, a light-touch modality developed by his teacher, Saul Goodman, the founder of the International School of Shiatsu. Craig has added the modality to his tool-kit in order to complement his usual, deeper Shiatsu work with light-touch work. Central Channel Clearing involves \"lightly touching specific points on the body that signal for the body to let go of compressions and misalignments. Those points are related to where the meninges of the spine attach to the bones,\" Craig EAT LOCAL, EAT NATURAL IS PROVIDING GRASS- FED, PASTURE-RAISED MEAT AND DAIRY TO SOME OF OUR FAVORITE LOCAL RESTAURANTS Eat Local, Eat Natural has supplied area restaurants with locally grown meat and dairy by refrigerated delivery, since 2008.

He explains that the meningeal layer of the spine is \"the core information system of the body.\" The technique accesses our proprioceptive system, which performs a \"balancing function\" that involves sensing where different parts of the body are in relation to one another. \"What happens is when there's a compression somewhere in the body or a misalignment, the rest of the body has to compensate for that. Then you have a whole system that is using energy to keep the body balanced, based on this misalignment. You are using a lot of your life force and it gets bound up in these misalignments and compressions,\" Craig says. During Central Clearing Channel treatment, Craig checks for visible physical misalignments in the body, as well as other signs that something in the body is compressed and leaking energy, and he occasionally stops to check whether a client's legs are resting at the same length or out of whack. He uses light-touch techniques on the spots along the body where he finds compressions and ener gy leakages in order to bring the entire body into better balance and alignment. Craig says the modality also helps release bottled up emotions that people tend to hold in their bodies for extended periods of time. \"There are all kinds of contractions that happen in your body in response to the stressful events that happen to us. When you have something happen to you that you're trying to avoid, the contraction never gets resolved until you completely experience the issue itself,\" he explains. Beyond the modality's physical benefits, Central Channel Clearing can bring emotional responses back to the surface of our awareness where we can better manage them, according to Craig.

More than 200 farmers, organizations, businesses, government officials and many other curious, food conscious individuals participated in a variety of food-related workshops throughout the day. What 's New in the Community This year's Food Summit featured the launch of \"Ten Percent Washtenaw,\" a campaign to grow 10% of the food consumed in Washtenaw County on local farms. Kim reports that the campaign was \"one of the central ideas of the summit.\" Part of the beauty of the \"Ten Percent Washtenaw\" concept is its simple, straightforward message and \"concrete, reasonable goal,\" which \"or ganizations, individuals, and institutions like the U of M can mobilize around\", she says. Kim elaborates, \"Even though we have some of the richest agricultural land in the state,\" it is estimated that only 1% of the $1 billion we spend on food is spent locally. The rest goes to companies out-of-state. She hopes the \"Ten Percent Washtenaw\" campaign will \"create measurable change,\" and that stakeholders in the community will continue to work together to refine \"a model that other counties in Michigan and other states can use.\" This year, the Food Summit challenged some of the participants to brainstorm a marketing campaign for \"Ten Percent Washtenaw\" that can be put to use in the real world. \"There were a lot of really good ideas and then this one really amazing idea,\" that came out of the exercise, according to Kim. The best idea of the day featured different people pointing to their palm and saying, \"I Eat Here,\" which Kim says, \"takes advantage of the mitten shape of our state.\" A group of grant writers are currently working on securing funds to grow the \"T en Percent Washtenaw Campaign,\" but in the meantime you can find out more about it online, at http://tenpercentwashtenaw.org For more information on the HomeGrown Local Food Summit, visit http://localfoodsummit2009.blogspot.com Local foodie Kim Bayer is now offering local food and Community Supported Agricultural (CSA) consultations, for people who are interested in making locally grown food a bigger part of their diet. \"There are a lot of people who are confused about all of the choices they have. CSA's cost different amounts, they have different seasons when they grow food, they have different pick-up days, some have a work requirement, some of them have events. There are a lot of different decision points. I break it down into criteria to help people decide what is a priority for them.\" During a consultation, Kim will give you a booklet about CSA's that she has produced, make recommendations, and answer any questions you have. Visit Kim's blog, www.thefarmersmarketer.com Contact Kim by email at kim@thefarmersmarketer.com Upcoming Events Psychotherapist and Life Coach Felix Paulick, of Growing Together LIfe Learning Center, is teaming up with Patrick Soule to host a new monthly men's discussion series, \"Guy Talk.\" Felix has found that it can be difficult for a lot of men to talk openly about their emotions, \"especially issues that commonly come up in the context of relationships,\" as well as other common issues related to stress, depression, trauma, sexual identity, and sexual compulsions. \"Sometimes the messages that you get from your parents or the mainstream culture about what it means to be a man can get in the way of having healthy relationships,\" he explains. He hopes that his work with clients, the regular support groups that he offers, and events like \"Guy Talk\" will \"give them permission\" to share their feelings openly. \"You may not have been taught certain skills as a child. They may have lead to some difficulties in your life now. But that's OK. This is a chance to learn those skills,\" he says. On May 18th, from 6:00 - 8:00 p.m., Felix and Patrick will host \"Guy Talk: Understanding Men and Relationships,\" at Crazy Wisdom. Then, on June 9th, they will continue the series with \"Guy Talk: Overcoming Depression,\" from 6:00 - 8:00, also at Crazy Wisdom. Felix moved to town from Toronto four years ago and began life coaching after doing marketing work for Major League baseball. Since then, he has also completed an MSW from the U of M, in 2009, and he added psychotherapy to his sessions with clients, in January of this year. In general, he has found that \"therapy is a better reflection of the work that I do with people than coaching.\" He finds it effective to \"look at childhood issues, and issues in the past, that are affecting them in the present,\" as is common in psychotherapy. However, he still uses what he has learned from life coaching to work on setting goals for the future with clients. For example, \"There is no point delving into the past unless it can help you create a better life as you are moving forward. Part of the work I do with people is very practical, like goal-setting, holding them accountable, and having clients think about what they really want out of their life in the present,\" he says.Transpersonal Psychologist Mara Evans (See page 12) Continued from page 9He also integrates \"experiential\" bodywork into his sessions, by showing clients ways to \"bring awareness to where they feel certain emotions in their body\" and to teach them how to \"allow yourself to feel what you are feeling\" on a conscious level. While his clients are becoming aware of how their bodies react to different emotions or memories, he is also paying attention to \"the whole presentation of the person.\" His work encompasses the Gestalt Therapy principle of noticing what is in the foreground, and what is in the background - an awareness of the 'Gestalt'. He helps his clients gain awareness of their body language or other signals \"from the unconscious\" that the clients \"might not even be aware of.\" Felix facilitates three different support groups on a weekly basis. His \"Men's Group\" covers the broadest base of topics in a two hour \"open forum\" where participants can talk about whatever issues they want to talk about. He also facilitates \"Men's Sexuality Group Therapy\" each week, in support of men struggling with sexual compulsions, addictions and other \"inappropriate sexual behavior.\" The group addresses these issues; however, Felix says the group is for the most part focused on answering the question: \"How do you get satisfaction from the real world?\" His third support group is \"Men's Trauma Recovery\" -- a \"psycho-educational, teaching-based program to understand what trauma is and how trauma impacts the brain and behaviors. Then, we also focus on healing from past pain.\" Find out more about Felix Paulick online, at www.togrow.org.

Every so often, subscribers to Bona Sera's email list receive a tip on an underground dinner happening somewhere in Ann Arbor. The \"strictly for charity benefits,\" started taking place in February of 2009, for mostly \"friends and friends of friends,\" Wonder Woman explains. Since then, Bona Sera has hosted numerous dinner parties at unusual locations, including private homes, community spaces, historical homes, a warehouse, and outdoor garden affairs. The events feature live music that suits the tone of each dinner, locally grown meals, and a \"social, party\" atmosphere, according to the pair. Suggested donations collected at the dinners have benefited a range of charities and causes. \"I think we've kind of honed it down in the last half year . We realized that the amount of money that we end up raising, which is anything over the cost of food, will have a bigger impact on a smaller organization,\" Bad Fairy says. The event has started to grow as more and more people hear about Bona Sera through \"word of mouth,\" Bad Fairy explains. The core group of volunteer organizers has grown as well, with the addition of even more alter egos with their very own \"superhero names,\" she jokes. \"We have one main student at the University that we call our Pimp. You can call him Jessie the Pimp. He finds most of our entertainment for us,\" Wonder Woman says. Then there is Fuego, Big Daddy, The Witch, and other local characters. Bona Sera encourages people who are interested in hosting or helping out with the dinners to get in touch. They are sure to have a job for you, and you might even get a new nickname out of the deal! In Bona Sera's case, details are always TBA. However, two little birdies told me that they are throwing a Bluegrass-themed BBQ and outdoor pig roast, scheduled for sometime in June. In August, they will host an installment of \"Night of 100 Drag Queens,\" which they plan to make an annual event. This installation of the event will feature a \"fairy tale theme,\" they report. In the future, Bad Fairy and Wonder Woman would consider taking Bona Sera above ground. \"It's something we're both interested in. I think that maybe in the future there will be a way to do that,\" Bad Fairy says. However, for the moment, \"It's a little naughty. If you find out, you're in the know,\" Wonder Woman adds.

You must register for the Soglio retreat, by June 12th. On this yoga, meditation, and chanting retreat everyone wakes up together on the side of a mountain situated near the Swiss-Italian border, for morning yoga and meditation practices. Everyone closes out the day with a group practice. The rest of the day you are free to choose your own excursions or \"just sit under a tree and soak in the beauty of the place,\" Jody says. After hosting the retreat on four other occasions, Jody knows the area well. However, each new year brings new surprises and discoveries. Last year, she discovered what she calls \"a secret meadow\" with ancient ruins, about a two-hour hike from Soglio. She is planning on bringing retreat participants to the spot for yoga practice and \"spectacular views,\" she says. If you feel like being adventurous in your free time, Jody knows tons of activities you can do to explore the local area, people and food. One thing that has impressed her about Soglio is the \"ancient farming techniques they use that have always been organic,\" and \"the respect and reverence for the earth\" you find there. You can tag along with Jody on an adventure, go it alone, or do absolutely nothing for a day, if it suits your fancy. \"It's really about co-creating a tailor-made experience for each individual person,\" she says. Find out more and register for this year's retreat to Soglio online, at www.beinawe.com/soglio-2010 Judith Blackstone, a psychologist, spiritual teacher and author, will be coming to the Ann Arbor area in May, and again in September. She will hold two five-day teacher certification-training workshops in her \"Realization Process\" approach to \"psychological healing, embodiment, and spiritual awakening.\" Participants will learn exercises that can be applied to \"personal healing and nondual realization\" in their own self-examinations and when working with others. Judith's exercises are described as \"easy, gentle attunements to the internal space of the body, the subtle core of the body, and the essential qualities of being.\" The first workshop will be held May 22 - 26. Part Two, which is required to receive a certification in the modality, will take place September 25 - 29. The two local people bringing her to southeastern Michigan are highly respected members of the regional transpersonal growth community , and their sponsorship of this event is an indication that a workshop with Judith Blackstone would be well worth attending for those interested in transpersonal subjects. One of them is Aura Glaser, one of the founders of Jewel Heart, the Tibetan Buddhist community located on Oak Valley Drive. (And she is also the original owner of Crazy Wisdom Bookstore, back in the 1980's.) The other sponsor is Brian O'Donnell, a local psychotherapist. O'Donnell is also an internationally sought after Pathwork teacher who leads workshops in the U.S., South America and Europe. O'Donnell was the subject of one of our earliest published \"Crazy Wisdom Interviews,\" in January of 1997. (Back issues are available at the bookstore.)

Mara says the workshop will first focus on \"looking at ways to clear your past, so you can claim your future,\" as well as \"removing barriers and things that are limiting in pursuit of your goals.\" Then the focus will shift \"from the individual to the universal,\" and the workshop will explore how \"as you are evolving as an individual person, the entire planet is also evolving.\" Find out all of the details and the location on Mara's website, http://arammai.com/workshops and read more about her in the \"New Practitioners and Businesses\" section of this column. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 11 Vida Stengel of Life and Spirit Journey (See page 13)Continued on page 12The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 12 New Practitioners and Businesses Husband-and-wife Tomm and Trilby Becker have started Sunseed Farm, their new organic vegetable farm. It's located at the end of Boyden Drive, near the corner of Joy and Maple Roads, just northwest of Ann Arbor. Tomm and Trilby found farming by following very different paths. However, they agree \"it felt like the right time to move to a farm and start a CSA,\" (a Community Supported Agricultural farm that supplies equal shares of the food that the farm produces to their membership each week). (See our lead article on CSA's in the May thru August 2009 issue of the Crazy Wisdom Journal, online at www.crazywisdom.net.) For Tomm, \"Farming definitely caught on early,\" he says. He worked at the MSU Student Organic Farm, as well as other CSA farms in Owosso, while studying English at school. He fell in love with farming right away. On the other hand, Trilby met her husband when she was getting her Master's degree in geography and had a plan to continue to develop a career working for Non-Governmental Organizations. Before coming to MSU, Trilby had interned at the White House twice, under Al Gore and Hillary Clinton, and spent time on small farms in Brazil. She was in Brazil working for the Center for International Forestry Research and working on her own documentary film. \"Ann Arbor offered us the greatest possibility. There is good farmland and community, a strong network of people. I could also find a job off the farm and continue to pursue my career,\" she says. If you would like to start getting 8 -15 items a week from Sunseed Farms, you can buy a seasonal membership to the CSA that is good for one 16-week season. The share that you pick up each week will amount to enough veggies for a family of four \"or two hungry vegetarians,\" they say. The types of veggies will change with the season, leaving you to look forward to new surprises every week in your 'surprise gift box'. Current pick-up locations for members are Thursdays at Sunseed Farm, from 4:00 - 6:30 p.m., and at Friday Mornings at SELMA Cafe, from 7:00 - 9:00 a.m, which is located at 722 Soule Blvd. Members are encouraged to come help on the farm, although work is not required to be a member. \"We're hoping more people will do that. It makes it more of a complete experience. The CSA is about getting great vegetables, but it is also about community, and having an opportunity to meet people, to generate ideas, to get outside, for your kids to see how food is grown, and to have a connection to that whole process.\" Tomm adds, \"The more people who come out to the farm, the better.\" Sunseed Farm is also working with beginning farmers. One of them, recent MSU graduate Nic Parton, will begin growing flowers on the property, which will be sold through to CSA members. They are also currently working with the farm's property owners, Chip and Kathleen Letts, and the Ann Arbor Greenbelt, in order to obtain Purchase of Development Rights that would ensure the land would always be developed What 's New in the Community Yoga instructor and teacher trainer Jonny Kest( See page 13)as working farmland. However, Tomm finds that \"the legal language they use to set up easements doesn't really work for small farms.\" Sunseed is currently collaborating with other stakeholders in the local food economy to \"figure out the right language\" to better accommodate small farms, while also \"preserving the original intent - to make it farm land.\" Selling Sunseed Farm produce at places like natural grocery stores, restaurants, and the Farmer's Market \"definitely fits into the plan,\" according to Trilby. \"Once we grow a surplus that is more than what 30 members need, we'll sell some to places like the Food Co-op, Zingerman's, the Farmers Market, and other places around town,\" she foresees. They are also planning on increasing their CSA membership from 30 to 60 shares by next Spring. They eventually hope to increase membership to 100 shares.

Contact them by phone (517) 980-0893 or email farm.sunseed@gmail.com Transpersonal psychologist Mara Evans is offering transformational consulting sessions through her new practice, Arammai Services. Its title is \"I am Mara\" spelled backward, \"because we are all multi-faceted people, and my struggle, like that of many others, is integrating my interests and strengths into a cohesive whole, so that I may step into my life's purpose. The name Arammai came out of that integration process,\" according to Mara. Mara, who also teaches psychology as an adjunct faculty member at Siena Heights University and Washtenaw Community College, admits that Transpersonal Psychology can be difficult for people to grasp, at first. On the first day of class, she might say something like; \"Transpersonal Psychology is a more holistic approach to psychology. It really encompasses all aspects of the individual, including the spiritual and the transcendent experiences. Our core essence, our spirit, has as much impact on our psychology as our physical bodies, our emotions, and our mental processes. It really means taking all of what mainstream psychology has done, and then building on that by adding the dimension of spirit,\" she says. One thing she tries to teach people is that there are \"different ways of knowing\" that help us understand different aspects of the universe and ourselves. These ways of knowing include getting information about the world from our sensory experiences, making sense of things with our logical mind, and becoming aware of a \"third way of knowing,\" which she identifies as \"the eye of contemplation.\" She also looks at the whole person, mind, body and spirit, by seeking to understand how people's religious or spiritual beliefs impact their worldview. \"Your religious belief system or your spiritual framework is an extremely powerful motivator, and it really affects our behavior on so many levels. It's the lens through which you see the world. Anything that happens to you, you're going to interpret it through that lens. As a psychologist, it's really important to understand what someone's lens is,\" she says. Before starting her new practice, in January of this year, Mara developed her skills in energy work and personal growth. She is also a certified Reiki Master and hypnotherapist. \"Sometimes I like to move my counseling sessions directly into energy work. I try to get people out of their heads,\" when needed, because \"analyzing it all to death isn't how we are going to solve problems.\" Furthermore, by using creative expression like art and writing in her work, clients are \"speaking the language of the unconscious,\" which achieves the overall goal of \"bringing things that are arising from our interior out into the external world. Creative expression is a great tool because we can grapple with things much better, if we can see things outside of ourselves and take an objective, curious view,\" she explains. Mara also leads a number of workshops, and provides Transformational consulting for businesses, as well as individuals and couples.

He recently started his healing business, Stillpoint Breath of Life , about two years ago, and he currently shares office space with Ann Zalek at TheraCare Therapeutic Massage & Healing Arts Center. Rex combines talk therapy, breath work, and energy healing techniques in his work with clients. \"We spend the first part of our consultation on the talking part, which basically gives me a better connection with you and helps me to target exactly what you are working on at that time,\" he explains. One conversational technique he uses is an initiative form of \"inner child work,\" which seeks to increase awareness of Continued from page 11how things that happened in someone's childhood relate to someone's current circumstances or self-image. \"Then we move to the [massage] table, where we work on connective breathing, and I also do energy field work like energy stripping, which helps you pull through the issue more easily,\" he explains.

Vida Stengel's new life coaching business, Life and Spirit Journey, marks a new phase in her own life and professional career. After spending most of her professional life working in the fields of medical administration and executive assisting, Vida received her certification from the Coach Training Alliance, in 2009. She now works with clients to resolve issues that are sapping their ener gy, become better aware of their personal goals, balance their schedule and ener gy, and \"listen to their inner guidance system,\" in her life coaching and spiritual coaching sessions. Vida originally discovered life coaching during a half decade of her life that was full of change and a need for \"extreme self-care,\" she remembers. She now utilizes a number of coaching techniques, tools, and exercises that she has learned along the way in \"co-creative\" sessions with her clients that help them care for themselves. Although her life coaching work is not all about goal setting, that is a significant part of the work she does with her clients. She suggests ways to take \"small steps that move someone closer to where they want to be,\" whatever their challenge, she says. Beyond maintaining a conversation with her clients, Vida encourages her clients to meditate, bring awareness to their breath, journal, and do other exercises that \"attract positivity to someone's life,\" depending on what they choose to work on in their sessions. Vida is also a spiritual coach who counsels clients \"to listen to their inner guidance system, because listening to your gut usually steers you in the right direction,\" she says. For clients who are interested, Vida can give you advice about how to communicate with your personal sources of spiritual insight and guidance. Her spiritual coaching work is non-denominational. She believes that spiritual guidance comes in different forms for different people, whether you feel a connection with angels, ancestors or spiritual guides.

Yoga instructor and teacher trainer Jonny Kest has opened a new yoga studio in town. The studio is one of three Center for Yoga studios that Jonny and his wife, Milla, have opened in the greater-Detroit area, where talented instructors teach Ashtanga Yoga to students at all levels of experience. They also teach a number of other styles of yoga. Jonny has practiced Ashtanga yoga and meditation for over 22 years. He was first inspired by his father to practice yoga, at the young age of 12, while living in Maui, Hawaii. Jonny was a witness to yoga playing a key role in his father's recovery from debilitating chronic lower back pain, and that inspired him. It may be no surprise that one of the original yoga styles that he has developed is called \"Healthy Backs Yoga.\" I had an opportunity to attend a \"Slowburn Yoga\" class, which is another style that Jonny developed, which I found to really work my core, and to warm me up. As is stated on the Center for Yoga's website, the yoga style, which is based in Hatha yoga, \"uses the complete yoga breath and closed eyes to focus attention inward.\" Some of the poses that my class instructor, Matthew Toth, walked us through were somewhat physically challenging for someone who is a bit out of practice. I admit that I got a little frustrated for a moment when I could not hold my leg up in the air for very long during warrior pose sequences, or when I didn't bend as far as I used to. However, the studio's statement that \"students will find the yoga room to be a truly non-judgmental environment,\" rings true to me. Ultimately, my frustration subsided under Matthew's encouragement, and it turned into determination to get the most out of the practice. Jonny founded the annual Midwest Yoga Conference, which will be held in Bloomingdale, Illinois this year, from June 3 - 6. Visit http://midwestyoga.com to find out more about the conference. He also offers a yoga teacher training program, called \"Seven Ways to Take Your Practice and Your Teaching to a Deeper Level.\" His trainees learn to teach Ashtanga/ Vinyasa Yoga and Jonny's \"Slowburn Yoga\" classes in the course, and they learn about anatomy, meditation and breath.

Meridian Tapping for Stress Relief and Emotional Freedom . Just a few minutes west of town, on a now transformed farm property on West Liberty, the Buddhist community known as Tsogyelgar has been quietly flowering. Founded in 1990, by Stuart and Katie Kirkpatrick (known by their Buddhist names, Traktung Khepa and Tsochen Khandro), the community has become something to behold and treasure. Every Crazy Wisdom reader has reason to pay attention to what is unfolding at Tsogyelgar, and every Ann Arborite has reason to be proud of the sheer beauty and profound ambition and deep purpose manifesting itself there. It is not only a residential Buddhist community; it also includes achingly beautiful gardens, and magnificent Buddhist art work and shrines. (After the opening of the Tantric Mural last summer, Current Magazine described the work as \"museum quality\" and \"Ann-Arbor's best kept artistic secret\".) Tsogyelgar, named for the great Tibetan female Buddha Yeshe Tsogyel, describes itself as a \"gathering place for human enrichment and spiritual development.\" \"It is a living mandala\" whose 25 acres include Crazy Cloud Hermitage, a residential Buddhist community, public peace gardens, shrines, a farming project working in conjunction with other charities to provide fresh produce and food security to local families in need, an innovative arts program, and a library of world literature on spiritual and human development. Collectively these endeavors are called \"The Human Enrichment Project\". On a typical Saturday, woodworkers, musicians, artists, gardeners, members of the Tsogyelgar community and friends gather to \"bring joy and compassion into form,\" inspired by Traktung Khepa's words: \"Compassion and creativity incarnate wisdom so that the beautiful, the good and the true become our center of gravity and the source of our actions.\" That vision is guiding Tsogyelgar. New works of art, charitable projects, and meditation gardens unfold and add to Ann Arbor's cultural assets. Meanwhile, the community grows and matures, and its members deepen their own spiritual lives. What follows is a 4-page photographic glimpse of Tsogyelgar's ever-evolving community. \"...community members have dedicated land and energy to producing a Human Enrichment Zone, which offers, to all, opportunities for embodying and enworlding the deep values of wisdom, compassion, and beauty.\" Celebrating the Flowering of Tsogyelgar, the Buddhist Community on West Liberty The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 14 \"Incarnating The Beautiful, The Good, The True\"\"New works of art, charitable projects, and meditation gardens unfold and add to Ann Arbor's cultural assets.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 15 A generous heart, kind speech, and a life of service and compassion \u2014 these are the things which renew humanity.\" ~ Buddha Tsogyelgar Pages Designed by Hans Anderson Photo Captions by Christina Burch Photos provided by TsogyelgarFor 2500 years, Tantric Buddhists have been exploring the geography of mind, mapping the interface between wisdom and bliss. T raktung Khepa has taught, \"The felt images and imaged feelings of Tantric art are a science of transforma-tion, they are a participatory technology of beauty. Their mystery of form and color draws us into the wonder of Buddhahood \u2014our o wn deepest reality.\" It was with a wish to share this ancient path of wisdom and beauty that Khepa commissioned master Thangka painter Rob Davis to create Tsogyelgar's mas-sive mural of Tantric art. The Mirror Hut In the 6th century, the Empress of China asked the mystic, Fa Tsang, to demonstrate subtle truths of wholeness and oneness without using words. In response, Fa Tsang built an aesthetic marvel called the \"Mirror Hut.\" In 2009, craftsmen at Tsogyelgar completed a re-creation of the Mirror Hut so that women and men today could also experience this mystery. One aspect of the creativity and arts at Tsogyelgar is the creation of forms that communicate the mysteries of life's spiritual dimensions. The thirty-five foot tall stupa with its dazzling colors, the Tantric Mural, the Mirror Hut, gardens, and more all speak of, and to, the deep truths which are beyond dogmas or even words. To see a beautiful video of the Mirror Hut visit www.tsogyelgar.orgThe Buddhas in the mural are potent symbols which evoke the enlightened energies of our spiritual potential\u2014T ara the Mother of All Buddhas, Chenrezig the Lord of Love, Majushri the symbol of Wisdom's Power, Mandarava the Flowery Princess of Enlightenment, and many others. For Buddhist practitioners, each Buddha becomes a doorway, an invitation. At a deeper level, the Buddhas, the offering gods and goddesses, plants, animals, and symbols become a map of the enlightened mind and body. Each Buddha becomes a 'skillful means' whereby we can benefit beings through active compassion. \" The Buddhas of the mural are potent symbols evoking the enlightened energies of our spiritual potential.\" Tantric Mural at Tsogyelgar \"What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.\" ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson \"One aspect of the creativity and arts at Tsogyelgar is the creation of forms that communicate the mysteries of life's spiritual dimensions.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 16Copper Colored Mountain Arts What began as a project to create the mural and other works of T antric art has now be- come an arts education program. An entire barn has been transformed into studios, work-shops, and laboratories for experimenting with the power of art and beauty. Artists are invited to teach, speak, and share in projects with students. This blossoming of activity arises from the union of wisdom and compassion in action. Copper Colored Mountain Arts (www.ccmarts.org) will be housed in the historic red barn adjacent to T sogyelgar. Here Mr. Davis will be teaching thangka painting, and a variety of other working artists will offer instruction in various arts such as ceramics and glass beadmaking. There will be classes in music, poetry , and Dharma Arts such as tsa tsa making, prayer flag making and ceremonial dance. CCMA will also host the One Pause Poetry Series, performances and exhibitions of contemporary art, and outdoor sculpture and installation in and around the gardens of T sogyelgar. The Mandarava Peace Park and Wishing T ree Gardens \"My garden is my most beautiful masterpiece.\"\u2014Claude Monet Where beauty and nature meet, meditation comes naturally; it is on this prin- ciple that the Tsogyelgar community started the Mandarava Peace Park. Winding through acres of community-held property, the gardens include ponds, flowers, art works, stupas, and places for sitting silently in the midst of nature. In 2010, four acres of flower beds, inspired by the painter Monet's gardens, will begin. Several new art works will be installed this year in partnership with Copper Col-ored Mountain Arts. In addition, a beautiful outdoor shrine containing a life-size statue of Tara, the mother of all Buddhas, will be finished. The gardens can be visited by appointment throughout the week. On Saturdays we invite the public to help us in creating and maintaining this sanctuary of peace and beauty. Another project in partnership with nature is the Wishing T ree Garden. This project works to address food security issues for families in need by partnering with Food Gath- erers' Faith and Food program. On several acres of recently donated land, Wishing T ree Gardens will initiate innovative natural farming methods and experimental aquaponics systems to help provide fresh produce to those in need. This project has found tre-mendous inspiration in the urban farming movement, especially the work of Growing Power in Milwaukee and Chicago. \"I am hiding amidst everyone. I have made the walls of my retreat hut from the fabric of appearance, hidden my mind in the emptiness of space and safeguarded my love in the guise of all beings.......\" ~ Traktung KhepaThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 17Sustainable Health By Judy Stone, CN, MSW Thinning Facts, Thinning Bones A friend recently asked me if she should take calcium as part of her daily regimen; she is small boned and has a family history of Osteoporosis. This question is one I hear often, and it's not one to which there is a simple yes or no answer despite the idea that has been emblazoned in our brains that we prevent bone loss by taking our daily calcium. This simplistic though not altogether unreasonable cause-effect link between the two is emblematic of \"give me a symptom I'll give you a ________(fill in, drug, supplement, herb, remedy)\" thinking that plagues allopathic and often alternative medicine. Most adults and many children know that calcium is needed to build bones. But so are protein, minerals, essential fatty acids, vitamin D, properly functioning digestion, good thyroid function, healthy adrenals, good acid-alkaline balance, and many other nutrients and physiological processes. So the answer to why your body may be losing bone, and why your friend's body may be losing bone, could be very different. I loved Sally Fields as the flying nun. As a young girl I had an obsession with all things \"nun\" until I learned it wasn't a career path for a Jewish girl. But I have to take issue with her convincing direct-to-consumer pitch to American women to jump on the \"convenient dosing of once a month Boniva\" bandwagon. Don't you just love the voice-overs on the drug ads that speed talk you through all the toxic side effects? \"Talk to your doctor if you experience pain or trouble swallowing, heartburn, ulcers in your stomach or esophagus, diarrhea, pain in extremities, or upset stomach. Do not take Boniva if you cannot sit or stand for 30-60 minutes\". They have to talk fast to get it all in because the list is long and scary. Do you know why you have to be able to sit or stand for 30-60 minutes? Because the stuff is corrosive and has the potential of causing serious gastrointestinal damage so you don't want it sitting there on its way to your bone. And it's not just Boniva; Fosamax, Actonel and other drugs in the category called Bisphosphonates all have the same, potential, problematic side effects... These drugs work by blocking cells in bone that would normally break down old bone cells, a natural part of bone turnover called bone resorption. They increase bone density by interfering with a normal body function, but they do not promote the other side of the equation, that is, they do nothing to stimulate the growth of healthy, new, strong bone cells. So they increase bone density by saving bone that was destined for the bone graveyard. The selling of Osteoporosis drugs is a very interesting tale of the making of a disease to fit the prescription. Several months ago, NPR's All Things Considered did a riveting deconstruction of this process (How a Bone Disease Grew to Fit the Prescription http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121609815). My summary will never do it justice and I hope since you are reading this article, you will also take the time to listen to the story as part of your medical empowerment. In short, around 1986, Merck, the maker of its now blockbuster drug Fosamax was at a loss to explain the drug's initial lackluster sales. Merck hired a hotshot consultant in the medical field, Jeremy Allen, to figure out why, and then to figure out how to goose sales. His analysis of the slow sales came down to the fact that not enough people were being screened for bone density, leaving doctors no reason to prescribe Fosamax. Screening machines, at the time, were large, expensive and not very common, leading to an access problem for patients. Allen convinced Merck that it needed to establish a non-profit, named the Bone Measurement Institute. Through the BMI arm, Merck was ultimately able to promote its mission of diagnosing more women with the condition for which it had the \"cure\". Along the way, between Merck and the BMI, a company was started to develop smaller, cheaper, screening equipment, as was a financing company to get the machines in the office of doctors across the country (and make it profitable for them to screen). Congress was lobbied to pass laws that got Medicare to cover the screening. But the real coup was the redefining of Osteopenia, a term previously used to denote a natural, non-threatening, bone-thinning process. By printing the term, and graphing Osteopenia on the report printouts that doctors and patients got from the bone screening, both doctors and patients alike were subtly manipulated into thinking they needed to do 'something' about Osteopenia. And that 'something', was Fosamax. 1992, in Rome, a small gathering of Osteoporosis experts, organized by the World Health Organization met to come up with a clear marker for when the process of bone-thinning that naturally occurs in aging, should be considered a health risk, and termed Osteoporosis. According to the recollection of one participant at that meeting, Dr. Anna Totenson, the decision was made fairly arbitrarily. After the stake was plunked down delineating Osteoporosis, the members decided to give the name Osteopenia to the group that fell just before the Osteoporosis cutoff line. It was nobody's intention at that time to define a condition that required treatment; Osteopenia was more or less a category created for the convenience of researchers. Bone Density, the measurement used to determine whether a woman (or man) is at a higher risk for bone fracture, has nothing to do with the quality and strength of the bone being measured. We want strong, flexible bone, not necessarily dense bone. Especially not when the density is created artificially by building up layers of \"dead\" bone. Understanding this will hopefully arm you to make an informed decision if you find yourself confronted with the diagnosis of Osteopenia, as will many women in their 40's and beyond, if they have a bone density test. However, we still need to address the question of how do we continue to generate healthy strong bone as we (men and women) age? Really what we need to understand is how we get in the way of that process because the body knows how to build bone. Pretending it all comes down to having enough calcium, is a myth great for drug sales but not so good for us.Here are a few aspects of health and lifestyle to consider if you want to support healthy bone: 1. Stay active. Chop wood, carry water . Incorporate bending, lifting, walking, running, biking, digging, and all manner of movement into everyday life. It's what we're designed to do. If you have to go to a gym to do it, fine, but consider how you might enrich your daily life by incorporating weight-bearing exercise and breathing deeply into the life you already lead. Plant a garden, clean your garage, haul firewood, you get the picture. If you have pain or other limitations that keep you inactive, get the help you need to address the underlying problem, as is possible. 2. Make sure your digestion is healthy . This is the number one problem for which I see people. It is a multi-layered problem and can be simple or complex to remedy. But it has to be remedied; digestive and gastrointestinal issues are the underlying issues in almost all conditions of compromised health. Specific to bone health, a main concern is that the majority of people as they age make less stomach acid, usually as a consequence of poor diet and its impact on how well the body functions. Stomach acid is required to properly absorb adequate calcium and other nutrients. If you are on acid blocking medications you are increasing your risk for Osteoporosis as well as lots of other illnesses because of the impaired nutrient absorption. Those medications were developed and tested for 6-week use, not the years people stay on them. It is possible to wean off them but see someone who can help you repair your digestion, and handle the rebound reflux you will invariably experience if you go off them. 3. Have your Vitamin D level checked regularly with a 1-25 (OH) Vitamin D test. The RDA of 400 IU daily of Vitamin D is not enough for most people in our latitude to keep levels sufficiently high for bone growth. D is also important for cancer prevention, depression treatment, and immune health. Practitioners vary in the reference ranges used but a minimum of 40 ng/ml is what many functional nutrition / medicine practitioners suggest. It is safe to supplement with 2-10,000 IU's daily in most cases, depending on your starting level, but it is important to monitor your levels so you do not get too much Vitamin D, which would then pull calcium out of your bones. The upper range can vary depending on your health needs, but 40-80 ng/ml wouldn't be too much for most adults. With any health issue, we are all vulnerable to feeling fearful and intimidated in the face of medical and pharmaceutical dogma. Armed with the facts, and some understanding of how our body works, we can become empowered to make better decisions that support our health. ### \"With any health issue, we are all vulnerable to feeling fearful and intimidated in the face of medical and pharmaceutical dogma.

Eating out is convenient, but it isn't always easy to make healthy choices from the menu. Cooking at home allows you to make mindful decisions about using healthier ingredients, but learning to make healthy recipes at home in a way that appeals to the whole family can be a challenge. Luckily, whether you're hoping to simply cook healthier versions of your favorite comfort foods or want to make a radical change in your diet, to become vegetarian or go totally raw, there are classes and services in the Ann Arbor area that can help you find healthier ways of eating.Ann Arbor's many cooking classes While some cooking classes in the greater Ann Arbor area focus on presentation or learning world cuisine without a strong emphasis on nutrition, there are a number of classes in Washtenaw County that focus heavily or exclusively on healthier fare. Those who enjoy traditional American and French cuisine and just want to discover some healthier techniques and recipes might enjoy taking classes with Ann Arbor Cooks!. Started in May 2009 by Natalie Marble, Ann Arbor Cooks! offers some of the only full-participation classes in Washtenaw County. Marble said that when she was researching places to teach cooking, she found mostly demonstration classes. Bringing Heal thy Meals T o Y our T able ~ Local Options for Cooking Classes Natalie Marble of Ann Arbor Cooks!The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 19 Continued on page 20Photograph by Rachael Waring\"Participation classes are where my heart is,\" Marble said. \"When students connect with ingredients and techniques, their confidence to create at home is much greater.\" Marble trained at the L'Academie de Cuisine, a small, private French culinary school in the Washington, DC, area that emphasizes cooking skills. While many of Marble's classes focus on having fun with food rather than specifically on health food, she said she does try to include local, or ganic ingredients whenever possible. \"I use the Farmers Market a ton,\" she said. \"We aren't fully organic, but I certainly try to bring as much organic product in as we can and promote that awareness.\" Marble also has started offering classes that are specifically aimed at people who want to eat healthy. For instance, earlier this year, she held a class for those who want to try going vegetarian and another for those who have made a resolution to eat healthier. \"Just because I'm classically French trained doesn't mean that everything is dripping with cream and butter,\" she said. Marble said she emphasizes technique over recipes, and that applies to her healthy cooking classes as well. She shows her students how to steam and blanch rather than fry their vegetables and fish, and how to take the same basic, healthy ingredients and season them in radically different ways. \"I'm trying to show that you don't have to take the flavor out,\" Marble said. \"Just because you're eating healthy, it doesn't have to be boring.\" Marble said she's still learning what the Ann Arbor community is looking for in cooking classes, but that her clientele is definitely aware of the big issues such as the slow food and locavore movements. \"We're seeing a big return to the kitchen,\" Marble said. \"Despite what some people might say, particularly locally here, people want to be aware of where their food is coming from.\" Adult enrichment classes offered through Ann Arbor Community Education and Recreation are another resource for healthy cooking classes. Linda Brzezinski, program supervisor for adult enrichment programs, said that she' s seen \"a lot of interest\" in cooking classes.\"We get a lot of requests for classes that are about healthy cooking,\" Brzezinski said. \"Currently, many of our cooking classes are co-sponsored with St. Joseph Mercy at the Catherine McAuley Center. Their classes are all health-related and taught by registered dieticians.\" The city's adult enrichment programs offer cooking classes at other locations as well, including Huron High School, the two local Whole Foods stores, and in the kitchen of Big George's Appliance store. Brzezinski said class sizes are typically kept small, so that students can get more one-on-one attention from the instructor. \"For instance, at Big George's, you're sitting right up to the breakfast bar, directly opposite the cooking surface. You can't get more than fourteen people in there. It's a nice, intimate class with lots of interaction with the instructor.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 20 \"I use the Farmers Market a ton.

Justin, a world class musician and skillful assistant, adds musical ambiance to Savasna and leads Kirtan. Brzezinski said the adult enrichment cooking classes attract a wide variety of participants, from high school students to mature adults and seniors. She added that the Community Education and Recreation department is \"continually striving\" to add more healthy cooking classes since, currently , demand outstrips availability. Another option for cooking classes is \"Flavors to Savor,\" offered through the Grass Lake Sanctuary. The Sanctuary is a 145-acre nature preserve space that specializes in rejuvenation retreats. Their mission, according to their online brochure, is \"to provide a space and programs where people can learn to reestablish balance and connection within their personal and natural worlds.\" Flavors to Savor is the sanctuary's sustainable agriculture and catering service. It uses a \"dirt-to-plate\" food concept that provides or ganic meals and hands-on education for events at the sanctuary, as well as cooking classes. This spring's class schedule includes offerings such as \"Gluten-Free Picnic\" with instructor Joanna Mills and \"The Mediterranean Diet: Three Great Dishes\" with David Leavitt. Heather Brumwell, a volunteer with the Sanctuary, said the classes started in the summer of 2009 and focus on foods that are \"organic, healthy and local,\" adding that they're also \"extremely fun.\" All of the proceeds from class fees benefit the sanctuary. Brumwell said the sanctuary's mission has three branches: land stewardship, rejuvenation and restoration services, and food for health. While the cooking classes obviously fit the \"food for health\" mission, they also contain elements of rejuvenation and land stewardship. Brumwell said that eating healthy doesn't have to be serious or boring, though. The goal is to make locally grown and organic food into meals that are \"fun and interesting.\" \"We're constantly making efforts to move toward creating the cleanest, most interesting relationship with food,\" said Brumwell, referring to a philosophy of organic, local, sustainable food, not fraught with ethical problems like factory-farmed food. \"And food is key for helping in recovery, or if you're going through a health issue...Basically, we're trying to give back to the earth while creating fun, new, exciting meals.\" Cooking and Food Preparation Classes: Ann Arbor Cooks!Instructor: Natalie MarbleEmphasis: Traditional French and American cuisine.Address: Inside the Main Dish Kitchen, 5060 Jackson Rd., Ann ArborPhone number: (734) 645-1030Web Lake Sanctuary's Flavors Savor Instructors: VariousEmphasis: Healthy dishes with local, organic ingredients.Address: Classes held at various locations.

Photograph by Rachael Waring Food dishes prepared by Natalie Marble ofAnn Arbor Cooks!Another place to take cooking classes is through Hollander's, a business best known for its stationery and paper supplies. They began offering cooking classes as part of the store's expansion last year, when they opened Hollander's Kitchen & Home. The classes at Hollander's feature cuisines from around the world, from Italian pasta dishes to Indian cuisine. The emphasis at Hollander's is not specifically on healthy food, but rather on developing an educated palate. Still, many of the dishes offered are healthy and cooked with local ingredients. George Rodgers, kitchen coordinator, said the classes are a recent addition, starting up in September 2009. \"It's still really new to us,\" Rodgers said. He said chefs and cooks in the area have been enthusiastic about offering classes through Hollander's. \"We've been really lucky,\" Rodgers said. \"People found out we started having these classes, and the teachers came to us. Right now, we're just featuring whichever cooks come to us and seem like a good fit for the store.\" Those looking for a complete change of pace when it comes to dietary habits might benefit from taking a one-time seminar or an ongoing class with local raw foods educator Ellen Livingston. Livingston received Raw Nutritional Science training from internationally renowned raw food and fitness teachers Dr. Doug Graham and Professor Rozalind Gruben Graham. Livingston's Web site explains that, for humans, \"our natural diet [should] consist of fresh, ripe, raw, whole, organic plant foods. These are the foods nature provides for us, and these are the foods that make up the diet of our closest animal relatives \u2014 specifically, the bonobo monkey, who shares most of our DNA and our exact digestive system, and eats a diet of mostly raw fruit and some leafy greens. When humans eat this fresh raw plant diet, devoid of animal or grain products, we thrive. Degenerative disease is avoided and our bodies work the way they're supposed to.\" \"My most popular current class is called \"30 Days of Raw Vibrance Coaching Group,\" Livingston said. \"It helps people be on a raw diet for 30 days. It inspires them and shows them what's possible.\" More than a food preparation class, this course offers a weekly support meeting that includes a raw food meal.Healthy Cooking Classes in Ann ArborThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 22 Continued from page 21 Raw foods educator Ellen Livingston said that some people worry about feeling deprived of comfort food on a raw food diet, but that this way of eating is actually \"very satisfying and satiating.\" Photograph by Rachael WaringPhotograph by Rachael WaringNatalie Marble and guests enjoy the completed meal.Careful food preparation by Natalie Marble.

She said many people pursuing a raw diet struggle because they don' t have support from family and friends, who don't understand the raw food diet. The meeting provides a rare opportunity for camaraderie with others interested in raw foods. Livingston also teaches two-hour classes with very simple recipes and a one- day informational seminar that explains the science behind the raw food diet. \"People do better if they really understand why they're doing it and what it's all about,\" she said. Livingston typically gets questions about how to get adequate protein and calcium on a raw foods diet and how to follow the diet safely. She said that some people worry about feeling deprived of comfort food on a raw food diet, but that this way of eating is actually \"very satisfying and satiating.\" \"What's very positive is that you're eating foods that are so obviously alive,\" Livingston said. \"They're just vibrating with pure water and ener gy. They're water-rich and nutrient dense. You get a lot of nutrients per calorie, so you don't have to overeat on calories to fulfill your need for nutrients.\" Livingston said there's a lot of conflicting information out there about raw food diets and many different ways to approach a raw food diet. She emphasizes a low-fat diet whose mainstay is fruit. \"Most people, given a chance to remember, absolutely love fresh fruit,\" she said. \"It's hard to overeat on fruit because it's so satisfying. Your appetite shuts down at the appropriate time.\" Livingston also teaches yoga, and says that exercise is the other half of the equation when it comes to healthy living. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 23 Crazy Wisdom's Email Service is a great way to showcase yourself, your business and your services!

It was my first question as well, and it proved to be a good starting point for Laurie Akerros to explain this method of healing within which she works. First of all, we have to realize that not only are we all flesh and bone physical beings, but we are also spiritual and energy beings at the same time. Laurie explained, \"Really, we're an energetic matrix that has a physical form, but the core of who we really are is energetic in nature. Each of us is comprised of several different subtle bodies of energy.\" \"We have a physical-etheric body, which is roughly the same size and shape as the physical form, and is concerned with the functioning of the organs and systems. The astral body is or our emotional self, the part of us that has to do with how we process on an emotional level. We have a mental body, which is the arena of our mind and how we think about things. Our Soul travels with us from lifetime to lifetime, and is of a higher vibrational essence than our personality self. Finally, we each have higher spiritual bodies, which are even higher in energetic vibration than the Soul. So, every person on the planet has all of these subtle bodies that make up who they are \u2014 and yet, the majority of us identify most often with only the physical form.\" While we may identify mainly with the physical body, oftentimes we are not really in tune with it. Laurie explained that because she works energetically, she can sense when someone isn't living in their physical body completely. Also, when she meets with a new client, she will ask what brought them to her or why they are seeking this type of healing work. Sometimes the situations with which clients are dealing are horrifying, and when she asks them how they are, the common answer is: \" 'Oh, fine.' You know; the traditional 'FINE' answer.\" (\"Fine\" can be an unconscious acronym for: Freaked Out, Insecure, Neurotic, and Emotional.) What this tells Laurie is that the individual may not be fully present in their physical body and not fully in touch with their emotions. Digging deeper still, she will ask: \"If on a scale from one to ten, ten represents being fully present in your body, and one represents being off on the moon somewhere, where are you on that scale?\" Most often, she says, \"The answer will be around a four or a five, meaning that people are really only half in their bodies at any given time, and sometimes even less so.\" Then there are many people who are disconnected from their emotional body. \"Most people don't really relate, in relevant ways, to their emotions,\" Laurie explained. \"In this North American culture, emotions\u2014 for whatever reason\u2014 are considered weak by many people, or you're considered to be out of control when you feel your emotions. Yet, we're given these emotions by the Creator, as part of our basic equipment with \"I just became more interested in the energy aspect of healing, rather than just chasing things around in the physical body...\"which to navigate life on the Earth plane. When we feel our emotions, we gather a lot of information about how we are experiencing our world. Our emotions are signals, meant to get our attention and relay important information.\" For example, \"It is helpful if one realizes they are suddenly feeling fear . Realizing what we are feeling offers important feedback. Now, we need to use our mental body along with our emotional body to decide what to do: leave, run, I need to change something about this situation because I am feeling afraid.\" Laurie stresses, \"Living only from the mind or only from the emotional self is a little like taking a shower with only the hot OR the cold water. The ideal is to blend and integrate both the emotional and mental bod-ies, a personality integration that then sets the stage for the Soul to begin to drive the bus.\" When we neglect to integrate all of our aspects, we become splintered or dissociated from those parts, which severely hampers our abil - ity to learn and grow through life's lessons. Prior to finding Esoteric Energy Healing, Laurie worked in the adult male psychotic ward of Kalamazoo State Hospital while earning her degree in psychology from Western Michigan University. After graduating, she worked at Detroit Baptist Children's home with emotionally disturbed boys, and also at Dearborn's Community Crisis Center, but she found, at the end of the day that \"not only were these positions stressful, but I didn' t feel content with my work or peaceful in my own heart. The people that I worked with in these positions were in deep suffering, and I began to question whether working in this field was really right for me. And I had not yet begun my own deep inner work.\" Laurie decided to take some time off to travel and even lived on Prince Edward Island for a time. When she returned to South Redford, where she had always lived, she took a position as a permanent substitute teacher in the Detroit Public Schools. Eventually she married, quit teaching, and she and her husband owned several Skyline Kite Shops and moved to Florida. \"I wasn't satisfied in retail, our marriage was stressed, and I sought out a good therapist to help me look at what I needed to do in my life to bring a significant change.\" Beginning to do her own inner work changed the direction of her life completely. She made the decision to divorce, and the healing arts were still calling to her. In 1984, while still living in Florida, she decided to go to the Florida School of Massage and Natural Health in Gainesville to become a licensed massage therapist, \"and to work holistically with people who wanted to feel better and improve their quality of life.\" Upon graduating from massage school, Laurie did some travelling with the casts of Cats and Phantom of the Opera as the massage therapist for the troupes. \"Eventually,\" she said, \"I just became more interested in the energy aspect of healing, rather than just chasing things around in the physical body. That led me to study Cranial Sacral Therapy and finally, Esoteric Energy Healing, where I seem to have found my home.\" Laurie took her first Esoteric Healing class at the recommendation of a good friend. Years before, Laurie had been in a bad car accident and had a residual and continual case of vertigo, which was extremely uncomfortable. She had gone to doctor after doctor, seeking healing and relief from the consistent dizziness, to no avail. However, during the Esoteric Healing class, the instructor worked with her and she was completely amazed to find that years of dizziness disappeared after a short Esoteric Healing treatment. \"That was it!\" Laurie said, \"I was hooked. I took every class I could, and eventually decided to become not only a practitioner, but a teacher with the International Network of Esoteric Healing. I wanted to devote the rest of my life to teaching this powerful work. It is the most complete healing tool that I know of, because it addresses all aspects of who we are as human beings.\" The beauty of working within this particular form of healing is that Laurie can use all of her skills and her educational training as part of the process.Photo by Carol Karr\"I don't consider myself to be the healer. The real healer is the client who comes to me; I am just the hammer or the chisel, one of the tools that they use along their path to healing. \"A Profile of Laurie AkerrosAt Home with Esoteric Energy Healing The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 25 Living only from the mind or only from the emotional self is a little like taking a shower with only the hot or the cold water. The ideal is to blend and integrate both the emotional and mental bodies. Photo by Sarah Neeley Laurie demonstrating how healing energy can be manipulated.And I did notice that I felt more tethered to the ground, or maybe it was more that I was noticing that sensation. But that feeling of immensity and the largeness of life also stayed with me for several days afterward. I also felt more relaxed and at ease with life in general, and this calmness seemed to make my emotional questions easier to deal with. I could certainly understand how this particular healing modality could be beneficial to the inner healing and wholeness that we all need. \"Even though I do this work, and have been working holistically for thirty years now,\" Laurie said, \"I don't consider myself to be the healer. The real healer is the client who comes to me; I am just the hammer or the chisel, one of the tools that they use along their path to healing.\" Laurie said. Anyone can learn Esoteric Healing. The core curriculum is taught in four parts over a few years. It is a science, not merely sending good intentions or wishes for healing. Students are taught to align and attune, how to palpate energy, and to focus their attention and intentions to create optimal conditions for healing. In addition, students and practitioners are encouraged to have a regular meditation practice to aid them in maintaining a centered balance while treating others. Working in this type of healing brings the practitioner into contact and interaction with all different kinds of energy, emotions, and feelings, so clearing one's own mind and energy field becomes a very important part of the practice. \"I don't do this work full time.\" Laurie said, \"I purposely only work part time, so I have the time to devote to doing my own work, and taking the time I need to be in nature and other things that bring me to a quieter and more centered state of awareness and being-ness.\" Laurie has been teaching Esoteric Healing classes for the last 1 1 years throughout the United States and Canada. She has a vacation home near Sarasota, Florida, and has taught a number of classes there. Currently , she is working on plans to teach an Esoteric Healing class in Giverny , France, in the small village where Claude Monet's flower gardens were located. When she is not teaching, she has a healing practice in northeast Ann Arbor, working with clients who want a deeper level of healing in their lives: physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. She also works with clients who suffer with chronic illnesses, such as muscular sclerosis and autism. Laurie said that she could be called a \"wounded healer\" because she came to this practice out of her own need for healing, as many people do. \"As I've continued to find my way through my own healing journey, I've been able to pull together a great 'tool chest' of techniques and methods for people to use as they do their work. As both a practitioner and a teacher of this work, I can tell you that it's really quite miraculous to see the changes in people, even after just a few sessions. It is such a sacred honor to walk with people for a portion of their journey.\" ### (Laurie Akerros can be reached at lakerros@hotmail.com or 734-255-2677.) How does Esoteric Energy Healing work? As Laurie explained it, when we find ourselves in this dissociative pattern that was described earlier, we are like an old telephone switchboard with all of its wires unplugged. Laurie's job or, more accurately, hers and her client's, is \"to plug those wires back into the right places so that 'inter-office' communication is possible between the various aspects of our selves.\" In other words, Esoteric Energy Healing has the potential to increase communication between the emotions and the mind, and between the personality and the Soul, which gives a tremendous boost to the overall healing of an individual, and optimally quickens our spiritual growth. \"It's really a bit like being a detective. I use my intuition, and I listen to what people tell me, and then set about finding the areas of energetic restriction within their auric field.\" When she performs a treatment, she assesses and treats the chakras, the organs, the systems of the etheric body, and all of the aspects of the subtle body energies: the emotional, mental, Soul, and spiritual. Laurie accomplishes this by following another major precept of the work: Energy follows thought . So, if someone comes in thinking they have a hip problem, she evaluates them energetically at the physical level, moves to the emotional and mental levels, and finally, into their higher spiritual levels. If she can sense a block in the flow of energy in any particular aspect, she focuses her intention on reducing or eliminating that block, and increasing energy flow, thus opening that aspect to greater wellness and healing. Laurie was nice enough to give me a \"demonstration\" treatment to provide me with a firsthand idea of how it works. Admittedly, I was somewhat skeptical because she had already told me that it was not a hands-on kind of treatment, but was energy focused. I sat down on the sofa while she sat in a chair across the room from me and told me to relax as best I could, and then took a few moments to center herself and her thoughts. Then Laurie asked me some questions about things that were currently going on in my life. I related that I was emotionally unsettled about several issues, not sure which way to go with them. She became very quiet. I leaned my head back and closed my eyes, though my mind was still going at least a mile a minute, as it usually does, with no sign of slowing down any time soon. I'm not sure how long I sat there like that before suddenly realizing that my mind was no longer racing along its usual paths, but was rather calm and quiet. I hadn't fallen asleep, but I was relaxed and very much at ease in that moment. I opened my eyes and saw Laurie making some gestures with her hands, as though she were clearing something out or making something bigger. After watching her for a few minutes, I closed my eyes again. Sometime later in the session, I had this feeling of immensity, as though life was much larger than I had realized. I was very much aware of myself as a physical being, but I was also much more aware of things around me than I normally am. Before I knew it, she was telling me to take a deep breath, and when I was ready, I could open my eyes. At the time I had no idea how much time had passed, but it had taken about an hour. Afterward, we spent several minutes talking about the session, the things she worked on, and how I felt. She said that she had done some grounding work with me, and that I may experience a feeling of heaviness or feeling more connected to the earth throughout the day. Laurie noted that I am very mentally oriented, and so the grounding would balance me and help me deal with the issues that were on my mind.

It was a vicious cycle that could not be broken by Western medication alone. In desperation I began a journey of seeking treatments with practitioners, many of whom were influenced by Eastern practices. I was introduced to massage therapy and craniosacral therapy, chiropractic, acupuncture, and nutrition counseling. When I emerged from this period of chronic pain, I vowed to seek a new occupation where I could help others with similar struggles.\" Ann was raised in Dallastown, Pennsylvania, and received her bachelor's degree in Mass Communications and Communication Studies from Towson University in Towson, Maryland. After working for fifteen years in marketing communication for health related and corporate clients, she and her husband, Steve, followed his work to Ann Arbor where she was finally able to realize her dream. She began by attending the Ann Arbor Institute of Massage, and after graduating, because she wanted to perform massage in a more medically oriented capacity, she thought that she would work in a chiropractor's office or perhaps in physical therapy. \"I wanted to help people with chronic pain, but my first 'office' was actually a space that I rented inside of a hair salon.\" Anne admits that it wasn't her ideal arrangement, but it worked amazingly well. In fact, it ended up being the best thing that she ever did because those same people who came in for a cut or a style also came to her for their aches and pains. At this point, she was doing more relaxation massage, but there were also those who began coming to her with specific issues because they had heard she'd helped someone else. From the hair salon, Anne moved her practice into a spa for a time, and between the two establishments, she was able to build enough of a client base that she could move her practice into a space completely dedicated to therapeutic massage and other healing arts. \"I moved the practice here on December 1, 2003, and I've had a full practice since that time.\" She believes that the word of mouth advertising she receives from her clients is the most valuable form of advertising. It seems the word about TheraCare has spread to the point that, even in the current economy, she no longer really needs to advertise her business. This has also allowed her to be able to share her space with three other practitioners, each with their own independent businesses. Kathryn Hannan has similar training and certifications to Ann, and performs similar therapeutic massage techniques, so as a team they can accommodate clients and cover for each other when necessary. Rex Montague-Bauer of Stillpoint Breath of Life teaches the transformational power and profound healing that can be found in breath and breathing; and Marie Slottow of Good Vibrations Healing, specializes in vibrational and reconnective healing frequency techniques. This particular combination rounds out the group and allows them to of fer a broad scope of therapeutic massage and healing art modalities. And there are a variety of massage modalities available to choose from at TheraCare, including: Deep Tissue, Neuromuscular, Myofascial, Swedish/Relaxation, Hot Stone, Pregnancy & Postpartum, Pediatric, Craniosacral, and Sports/Athletic, as well as others. So, how does a person know which method is best for him or her? Ann explained that the answer really depended on the person and his/her own particular situation or circumstance. The key for Ann, however, is in the dialogue that she has with her client. \"I usually schedule sessions in 90 minute increments. 15 minutes of that time is spent in talking to the client during the intake process, which gives me the opportunity to ask questions and to get a handle on what is going on with them, and that can help us decide which method to use. And then another 15 minutes is spent in an exit dialogue in which I can find out how they feel now as opposed to when they first walked in the door . During this time I can also make some suggestions to the client about things that they can do on their own at home to help relieve muscle pain and tightness. So that dialogue that I have with my client is invaluable to the entire process because it lets me know where to start, when to make a change, and also helps me to know when a client is able to take charge of and handle their process on their own.\" Ann is adamant about not having any of her clients being solely dependent upon her. She is more than willing to make suggestions of exercises that can be done at home, or little tricks that she can teach someone to use to ease muscle tension and or pain so that they don't have to continually shell out money for a massage. However, she is also quick to point out that as a massage therapist, \"I cannot and do not diagnose illness or disease or prescribe medications or treatment. I do not perform spinal manipulation. Massage therapy is for the purposes of reduction of stress, muscular spasm or pain, and for the purposes of improved circulation, energy and sense of well being.\" So while she cannot prescribe treatments and exercises, she can make suggestions for a client The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 26 \"Oftentimes, when a parent has to go back to work shortly after the birth of a child, it's stressful, because she or he is missing out on an important time in the baby's early life. And so being able to spend this kind of quality time interacting with your baby in such a loving and nurturing way, even if only for 10 or 15 minutes, is really an amazing way of relieving that stress.\" A Visit with Ann Zalek Massage Therapist and Bodyworker Ann Zalek, owner of TheraCare \"The work that I do is very heart centered. It happens to be a business, but everything I'm doing is about building relationships. I care about every client that I have, and it's really a joy to be able to be integrated into so many families throughout this community.\" Heart-Driven Relationship Building through Massage Therapyto stretch a certain area or to strengthen another area, based on the dialogue that she has with that individual, and so each session ends up being customized for that individual alone. While some of her clients do come in for relaxing massage therapy, about 90% of her clients come in for very specific reasons, whether it's general body and muscle pain from Fibromyalgia, pain from cancer related illness, or even pain from a sports injury. So, she currently finds herself working in the medically oriented capacity she had originally wanted, when she first began her practice. One portion of Ann's practice that seems to be very important to her, as well as one that I was able to observe first hand, is her Infant and Baby Massage classes. These classes can be taken either in private or in a classroom setting. Now if you are at all like me, you may well wonder why a baby would need massage therapy. I know that when I was a child, it was probably one of the last things that my parents would have thought about when it came to my overall health and well being. And since the study and practice of infant and baby massage didn't really begin to take root in the United States until the 1980's, well, let's just say that I was no longer a baby! Still, what is the necessity, or perhaps better asked, the philosophy behind infant and baby massage? \"Nurturing touch is healthy and beneficial for parents and babies in establishing attachment bonds.\" Ann explained. \"Let's face it, babies don't come with instruction manuals, and as parents, we don't always have all the necessary, or even the best coping skills, so massage is just one of many techniques that can help in the process of forming those bonds. It should begin at the time the baby is born because that is the most important time for forming those bonds. So, it really is as simple as nurturing, loving touch.\" Some of the benefits of baby massage consist of: stimulation through interaction between parent and baby; relief for bodily functions\u2014because babies systems, digestive in particular, are immature, they often need prompting so massage can facilitate relief from constipation, gas, and colic; and finally relaxation. It's important to understand that babies have as many nerves and sensory receptors in their bodies as adults do, so often touch, light, and sound can be overwhelming stimulations for them, and massage can just help dial down that nervous system to help them relax. For parents, the key benefits that massage provides are confidence because they now have an extra tool at their disposal to handle their child's well being. And possibly even more important, it gives the parents and the child time to spend together in an interactive way. That's another important part of infant massage. \"Oftentimes, when a parent has to go back to work shortly after the birth of a child, it's stressful, because she or he missing out on an important time in the baby's early life. And so being able to spend this kind of quality time interacting with your baby in such a loving and nurturing way , even if only for 10 or 15 minutes, is really an amazing way of relieving that stress.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 27 Massage also helps develop a healthy and strong level of trust between mom, dad and baby. Since it is a technique that can and should be used from infancy, and continued throughout childhood, that trust helps to establish lines of communication between parents and child, and helps keep them open as they grow and mature. Another important aspect of massage for the baby is that it really begins to teach them the connectedness of their bodies. There is an integration stroke that comes at the end of the session that basically begins at the head and ends at the feet, and baby begins to realize that everything is connected. \"And that is an amazing thing for a baby to begin to understand,\" Ann said. If the massage techniques continue to be integrated throughout childhood, it teaches children to become familiar with their bodies, and provides them ways to take care of their bodies' needs. \"It shows them that self-touch is a positive thing.\" Ann shared with me how she has performed massage on her son, Evan, since he was just a baby. \"It has taught him that there are ways that he can help himself when his body isn't feeling the greatest, that rubbing his belly in a certain way is okay when it hurts. And it has certainly helped establish trust between Evan, Steve and myself. Now, at the age of seven, he feels comfortable telling us anything, the good and the bad, and we do hear it.\" As I observed the class, it was obvious that the techniques she taught were anything but difficult. They are just tools that parents can use to bond with their babies, and provide a nurturing way to interact with them on a daily basis. The mothers seemed to enjoy this time with their babies. It was a special time that was set aside, away from the house and the concerns of daily life, and it was dedicated to spending time with their babies in a healthy, nurturing, and interactive way. The babies looked as though they were ready, their faces were bright and smiling, as though they knew that this was their own special time with Mom. There was one little guy who seemed to be having kind of a rough day, was kind of fussy, and had a bit of a bellyache. Mom worked with him, concentrating on rubbing his belly, and by the end of the session, he seemed to be feeling much better, and even doled out a few smiles to the stranger in the room with the flashing camera in her hand. Ann explained that it's okay for baby to say no to massage when they aren't feeling well, especially since they are receiving this nurturing touch every day rather than just once a week during class time. \"This is their time, and we have to honor their answers and responses.\" Ann is currently working on expanding her focus to include pediatric massage and helping children who have special healthcare needs, like cerebral palsy, for example. \"There are massage techniques, like Myofascial massage, that can help with spastic or excessively tight muscles, and can help relieve some of the discomfort related to that.\" She's also going back to school for licensing in Occupational Therapy, which will open doors for her to be able to work with all different kinds of people with a variety of health concerns in a variety of venues, like hospitals and rehabilitation centers. \"The work that I do is very heart centered,\" Ann said. \"It happens to be a business, but everything I'm doing is about building relationships. I care about every client that I have, and it' s really a joy to be able to be integrated into so many families throughout this community .\" ## \"There are a variety of massage modalities available to choose from at Thera Care, including: Deep Tissue, Neuromuscular, Myofascial, Swedish/Relaxation, Hot Stone, Pregnancy & Pediatric, Craniosacral, and Sports/Athletic, as well as others.\" \"Massage also helps develop a healthy and strong level of trust between mom, dad and baby.

She received her undergraduate degree from the University of Minnesota, and her MSW from the University of Michigan, with a specialization in community organizing. Carole started her career in the field of Gerontology, working for 13 years at the U of M Geriatric Center as a volunteer coordinator for their older adult outreach program. In 1997, she and Sally Wisotzkey founded the organization, Raising Strong and Confident Daughters. Since that time, Carole has been presenting workshops on that theme, and also directing the after school program, It's Great to be a Girl, in collaboration with the U of M Office of Academic Multicultural Initiatives, Eastern Michigan University, Girl Scouts Heart of Michigan, and three local middle schools. She is married to Jeff Spaulding, a school psychologist with Jackson Public Schools. She has two daughters: Mira is a junior at MSU, and Ilana is a senior at Pioneer High School.) Bill Zirinsky: Carole, you mentioned to me that Mary Pipher's book, Raising Ophelia, had 'opened your eyes'at the time you first read it. Let's start with that. How old were your daughters at the time, and what impact did the book have on you? Carole Lapidos: My daughters were eight and five when I read Pipher's book. I can honestly say that reading her book changed my life. Her accounts of what was happening to girls as they moved through early adolescence and beyond both frightened and frustrated me because I felt that not a lot had changed since I was a pre-teen. My being frightened had all to do with being on the other side of the table as a mother of two daughters. So what was Pipher saying? She talked about the girls she was seeing in her private practice and how they were struggling with 'dumbing down' - in other words, hiding their intelligence because it wasn't cool for girls to be smart. Many were overly focusing on their appearance and popularity, thinking those things are what is most important about being a girl. I felt determined to be a part of a movement that supported girls in looking beyond these very negative and narrow definitions of girlhood. In looking around Washtenaw County, I did not see a program that was directly dealing with educating parents, teachers, and coaches on how to support girls in staying resilient. It was at this time, in the fall of 1997, that I partnered with Sally Wisotzkey, a local therapist and parent of a then nine-year-old daughter who attended my daughter's school. Sally and I immediately connected and felt that by starting with talking and sharing information with parents of young girls, that we could begin addressing the salient issues that were impacting girls' self-esteem. We founded Raising Strong and Confident Daughters, an organization whose mission was to work with children, their parents, and professionals within the community, to develop and implement innovative, prevention-oriented programs that would support girls in resisting the cultural stereotypes that limit their potential. Bill Zirinsky: You said to me that \"it takes a lot of resilience for girls to hold on to their true selves\". Will you elaborate? Carole Lapidos: I feel strongly that at a very young age our daughters are faced with many pressures to be somebody they are not. In the 13 years that I have been doing this girl development work, I have seen the trend on the part of merchandisers and corporations attracting the attention of younger and younger girls with products, clothing, and make-up that blur the lines between children and teens. The Girl Scouts of the United States of America, through their research studies, coined the phrase, 'developmental compression.' The years of being a child are being condensed into a smaller and smaller space. So much so, that I had a mother at one of my workshops share with me that at her daughter's seven year old birthday party, more than half the girls when jumping into their pajamas to get ready for bed were wearing thong underpants! When I talk about resilience, I am talking about creating opportunities for girls to talk about the pressures they feel to grow up too fast and to have loving supportive adults assist in expanding the parameters of the 'girl box' that defines girls based on their looks, sexiness and popularity. The way to help develop a resilient young woman is to help her look critically at the culture's messages about what it means to be a girl and a woman and support her in being true to her interests, passions and values. Zirinsky: How toxic is the culture to girls?Lapidos: Very!!! Girls and the adults in their lives have to work hard to find positive role models for girls. When I talk with parents, I encourage them to become girl culture experts. Pay attention to the TV shows, movies, and magazines that target girls. Practically everything out there portrays girls in the most stereotypical way. Take a stroll through the toy aisles at any department store and you will still see the pink aisle with baby dolls, dress up dolls and Barbie. The boy's aisles will have action figures, trucks, and action oriented toys. In addition to the stereotyped way in which girls are defined, we are now facing an increasingly dangerous sexualization of girls. An example of this is the Bratz doll. These dolls are dressed in very sexualized clothing. They wear miniskirts, fishnet stockings and tight skimpy shirts. As caring adults in the lives of girls we need to help them navigate this journey. Zirinsky: I understand one of your daughters did a survey for a course she was taking, on 'girls and body image', not too long ago. What were her findings? \"In the 13 years that I have been doing this girl development work, I have seen the trend on the part of merchandisers and corporations attracting the attention of younger and younger girls with products, clothing, and make-up that blur the lines between children and teens. \" Carole Lapidos \"\"\"If someone had asked me ten years ago to close my eyes and envision what my daughters would be like at seventeen and twenty, I would see them as they are now. I am a bit biased but I see their greatness!\"Photo by Rachael WaringLapidos: My daughter Ilana is a senior at Pioneer High School. As a project for her psychology class, she and another classmate conducted a survey of fifty girls between the ages of sixteen to eighteen. Some of the results they found were very disturbing. Seventy percent reported they would change their appearance if they could. Sixty-eight percent have tried to lose weight or been on a diet. Ninety-five percent constantly compare themselves to other girls. Sixty percent believe wearing tight clothes will make boys like them. Seventy-six per cent of girls felt pressured to look a certain way . BZ: In raising your own daughters, you said: \"I made it my personal goal that I wouldn't say something derogatory about my body to my kids\". Were you able to keep to that, and what effect do you think it had on your daughters? Lapidos: One of the most important pieces of information I gleaned from all the books I have read on this topic, was, don't talk negatively about how you look in front of your daughter. One of the most powerful examples I read was an anecdote from a mom who was sharing that she was with her eight year old daughter in a department store dressing room trying on jeans and the mom said out loud, 'I look so fat and ugly in these jeans!' Her daughter looked up at her and said, 'but mommy, everyone always says we look just like each other.' I really tried to hold onto keeping my own sometimes negative feelings about my body to myself. Did my husband hear it, oh yeah! BZ: Please talk about the power of male approval, and male privilege, and how that relates to dads, as stewards and as representatives of malehood? And did/does your husband \"buy in\" to your viewpoint? Lapidos: I think it is very important for fathers to understand that they play a very important role in helping shape their daughters view of themselves. Girls want their father's approval. Girls want time with their dads. When daughters are little, dads can begin to lay down the tracks that forge their relationship. If there is comfort and support there, daughters will turn to their fathers throughout their lifetime. BZ: Let's talk some more about dads and daughters. You mentioned to me that you work a lot with college women and they can remember when their dads 'stepped away', and the way that gets interpreted by teenage girls as \"what's wrong with me\". Can you expand on that for us? Lapidos: I think some dads have a more difficult time figuring out how to stay in relationship with their daughters once they move into puberty and start to become young women. The college women I work with expressed feeling rejected by their fathers when they started developing and menstruating. The young women thought something was wrong with them and didn't understand their fathers' changed behavior. On the other side, fathers have expressed to me that they too feel unsure about how to stay engaged when a big part of their interaction was wrestling and having her sit on their lap. I encourage dads and daughters to find new ways of being together. An example is Dad and daughter night out. The key issue is connection; how you connect can be determined by both dad and daughter. BZ: Another facet of working with dads and their relationship to their daughters is fathers yearning for the opportunity to understand their daughters' feelings, and those of other young women. Tell us how you've been able to work with that disconnect? Lapidos: I just conducted a workshop recently and one of the dads spoke up and said, 'I don't speak girl!' A lot of girls are verbal creatures. I encourage dads to engage girls in conversation. If as a dad you don't understand what your daughter is expressing, then ask for clarification. The important thing here is your willingness and interest in being with her. BZ: Recently you were at a workshop led by author Courtney Macavinta, who does workshops with high school and college women. Can you tell our readers about the exercise in which one tries to envision one's daughter in ten years, and its broader meaning? Lapidos: The exercise involves closing your eyes and seeing your daughter as she is right now. Visualizing her with friends in activities and paying attention to the feeling you get as you see her. The next step is to imagine her ten years from now. Again, noticing what she looks like, who she is with, and what she is doing. This exercise provides a window into your vision of what you want for your daughter. I think it is always valuable to have a picture of what your daughter might move toward in the future. It is important to always remember that who she becomes will be up to her. The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 31 \"Girls want their father's approval.

Please talk about her references to \"the other people in the room\" - the other women, the other stories, the other female role models. Lapidos: When our daughters are growing up with us as their parents, there are always other people in the room. The other people aren't really physically present; they are the influences of our parents, or grandparents, or stories or beliefs that we grew up with. Being cognizant of what these influences are can be really enlightening as we struggle and celebrate who are daughters are. BZ: At this point in time, you are primarily doing parent workshops and running a mentoring program. Is that right? Lapidos: I offer parent workshops throughout the state of Michigan and will be for the first time this year doing workshops in Canada. The It' s Great To Be A Girl mentoring program that I run is an innovative and effective self-esteem building program. This past fall, my colleague, Kimberly Grover, and I conducted an It' s Great To Be A Girl training for MSU students through their Residential College for the Arts and Humanities. MSU is exploring setting up this program in Lansing. As we work to develop the training manual, we hope to offer this mentoring model training throughout Michigan. BZ: Please tell us about the It' s Great to be a Girl mentoring program, and about the topics which are explored by the 11-year-old girls and their \"femtors\". Lapidos: The program is a ten week afterschool program that provides the opportunity for sixth grade girls in the company of college women who we call femtors to explore and discuss the many topics that impact the daily lives of eleven year old girls. The topics include friendship, body image, teasing and harassment, advocacy, and dream building. The femtors complete a three-week training, learning how to guide discussion and activities on these topics. The femtors have this instant 'cool factor' and the girls love being with them and sharing what is happening in their lives. This year we had a femtor work with us who had been in the program as a sixth grader. She talked about how the things we discussed when she was in sixth grade stayed with her throughout high school. BZ: Can you tell us about the Get it Together for Girls organization? Lapidos: Get it Together for Girls is a network of individuals and organizations who offer programs, services and support to girls and young women, approximately ages 8-22, in Washtenaw County. We share information about what is being offered for girls and what support is needed. We will be working to identify community needs that are unmet and will work together to direct resources toward meeting those needs. Get it Together for Girls meets three times a year. Each meeting has at its centerpiece an educational component. Recently, we had a very informative program titled, A Multicultural Perspective on Body Image and Disordered Eating. I worked with Sharon Gold-Steinberg of Strong Moms Strong Girls, a program of the U of M Center for the Child and Family. (The Junior League helps to provide the funding for Strong Moms Strong Girls.) BZ: In the book, The Secret Lives of Teen Girls, the author, Evelyn Resh, writes about navigating through girl friendships. She writes about girl to girl cruelty, and the volatility and drama in girl friendships. Will you speak to that? Carole Lapidos: I think a lot of media attention is paid to the topic of girl cruelty in friendships. We know girls can struggle in their friendships and that it can create a lot of drama but we don't pay enough attention to the ways in which girls do stick up for each other and support one another through very difficult situations. Girls have deep connections with one another and they learn a lot about themselves through their friendships with other girls. It is important to let girls know that there will be conflicts in their relationships but if both girls are willing to work it out it can strengthen the bond they already have. BZ: You reminded me that we all have \"so many scars from middle school\", and also that it's important to \"honor those struggles\". Why do we need to honor those long forgotten and painful memories? Lapidos: I think remembering the ways in which we were 'injured' in middle school can shed some light on what our children go through. Middlers are just trying to figure out who they are and who their friends are. At this age, kids are dealing with so much insecurity it is inevitable that somewhere along the \"Whether she wears dresses or baseball jerseys, it is who she is and what she is passionate about that really matters.

Sometimes we as parents need to take a closer look to see if our child is the one doing the teasing. BZ: In talking about the intense feelings that girls experience in their friendships and relationships, you noted that \"they're really heartbroken\". And that parents dismiss \"the heart of their children's feelings\". Say more, please. Lapidos: I think that for many girls the early friendships they develop in elementary school are their first experience with being 'in love.' Girls are sharing secrets, exchanging clothes, buying each other gifts, etc. Girls are learning about loyalty and connection. When these friendships run into trouble or maybe jealousies arise with other friends, girls can experience a broken heart. It is very important for parents to listen and validate how important her feelings are. There will be a roller coaster of emotions happening with your daughter but be aware that you do not have to ride it with her, you can be a supportive bystander. BZ: You were on the Today Show, correct? I know they don't give anyone too many minutes to talk about anything in depth, but what was your subject matter, and what did you hope to get across? Lapidos: I appeared on the Today Show in August of 2007. I was asked to talk about the topic of tomboys. The concern that parents had with having a daughter who was a tomboy was that she would be teased and she would be missing out on being a girl. What I shared was how important it is to embrace who your daughter is. Whether she wears dresses or baseball jerseys, it is who she is and what she is passionate about that really matters. Being an ally to your child is the most important role you can play. BZ: In late January you attended a workshop on \"the Lolita Effect\". Please tell us about that. Lapidos: The workshop presented the harmful effects of the rampant proliferation of sexualized images of girls and young women in advertising, merchandising, and the media. This kind of exposure can be harmful to both girls and boys. Girls can take away that what is valuable about them is how 'hot' they are and this can impact the development of a healthy sexual self-image. Boys learn to see girls and women as sexual objects. Parents can play an active role in limiting some of the exposure their young teens have to this media. Dialoging with older teens about these issues can provide an opportunity to express your values on sexuality and relationship issues. BZ: How do you think your involvement with these issues has affected your daughters? Lapidos: I think my involvement in these issues has had a significant impact on my daughters' lives. They both have volunteered for girls conferences and led discussions on body image and friendship and dream building. My oldest daughter has been involved for over two years with Michigan State' s sexual assault prevention program, and my younger daughter is a member of Young Women for Change, a fundraising program that supports girl programming in Washtenaw County. They see the impact that our culture has on girls' self-esteem but I do believe they have developed a 'struggle muscle' as it relates to these issues that seems to fortify them in significant ways. If someone had asked me ten years ago to close my eyes and envision what my daughters would be like at seventeen and twenty, I would see them as they are now. I am a bit biased but I see their greatness! BZ: How do you think your husband has been affected by your deep involvement in these issues, and your expertise? Lapidos: Jeff says that by being exposed to these issues through me it has helped him understand some of the issues girls face and how they are af fected by the father's attitudes towards body image and the idea of 'beauty'. BZ: Thank you, Carole. ###The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Sally Wisotzkey Interviewed by Bill Zirinsky (Sally Wisotzkey has lived in Ann Arbor for a quarter century, and been a practicing psychotherapist in the area for 23 of those years. She specializes in the issues of teens, especially girls, young adults and women, par enting and families, self esteem, grief and loss. She also treats trauma and family of origin issues. Sally was trained in Person of the Therapist work with Harry Aponte, and she is an EMDR therapist. Also, she' s been working with issues of spirituality in psychotherapy for many years. In 1997, she and Car ole Lapidos co-founded Raising Strong and Confident Daughters . Sally grew up in York, Pennsylvania. She received her undergraduate degree from University of Pittsburgh in 1974, and her MSW from U-M in 1977. She has two children, Annah, 21, and Jake, 19. They are from her first marriage with Jon Wisotzkey, who died of cancer in 1992. She was remarried in 2002, to Steve Wyzgoski, and has two step sons, Cal, 25, and Sam, 21.) Bill Zirinsky: Sally, the book, Reviving Ophelia, had a strong impact on you and Carole Lapidos, at a time when your daughter was in second grade at Abbott. Why? Sally Wisotzkey: In Reviving Ophelia , Mary Pipher spoke to me as a mother and a woman. She made a strong case for the risk girls in our culture are at, of losing their unique and special selves in the face of a culture that objectifies girls and women. My reaction was FEAR that my daughter, who was 8 at the time, would be harmed. What parent isn't afraid that the unhealthy aspects of a current culture, (be it objectification of girls, pressure to grow up too fast, pressure to achieve rather than learning to be, substance abuse, etc) will take their children Sally Wisotzkey \"We, too, like our daughters, are still works in progress and we bring our own strengths and frustrations to our roles as mothers. Thank goodness we 're not perfect! \" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 33 Carole Lapidos and Sally Wisotzkey will be presenting an evening on Parenting Teens on Monday, May 17th, 7-8:30 pm, at Crazy Wisdom. They'll answer questions and facilitate a discussion about how parents can navigate the difficult adolescent years with their teens. For more information, see the listing in the Parenting section of the Calendar, on page 80. Photo by Rachael Waring Continued on page 34to meeting the needs of struggling teenagers. I worked there in the capacity of both a school social worker and as part of a community collaboration in developing alternative educational opportunities for teens. As a professional, I became more aware of the specific problems teen girls have with self esteem and self image, and was a part of developing support groups for girls. My time there laid the foundation for my interest in and ability to work with teens and their families, and to create programs that are engaging and fun for them. From there I started a private practice as a therapist specializing in working with the issues of young people and their families. My children were born in 1988 and 1991, and I began to learn about children from a new perspective, that of parent. Now I had to try to use the advice I had been giving for many years! The opportunity to weave together my interest in working with teen girls, my previous experience with developing school based programs, and my own parenting came together when I had the good fortune of meeting Carole. Working with and learning from Carole as we founded and grew Raising Strong and Confident Daughters has been a true blessing for me. I couldn't have a more delightful and loving human being as a friend and business partner! These days, I have focused back on my work as a therapist, while Carole has continued to create and evolve the programs. Zirinsky: And so your professional background, and your being a mother with a daughter to raise, came together --- with respect to developing a specialized expertise in mother and daughter relationships? Wisotzkey: I think my expertise in the specific issues of girls, teens, and parenting has evolved over the years as a combination of my own life experiences and professional opportunities. Parents, both mothers and fathers, have such a profound impact on boy's and girl's sense of themselves and their self identity as young men and women. For example, it is every bit as challenging and important as a mother to raise our sons with a healthy sense of self, as it is for us to raise our daughters in a healthy way . In addition, being a single parent for 10 years raised my awareness of the unique challenges single and divorced parents face, and their exceptional need for support from other parents within the community. I could not have raised my children without reaching out for and receiving support from neighbors, friends, schools, community organizations, churches, etc. I notice as my own children get older, I have been working with more clients their age. Again I feel fortunate that my work life and personal life experiences have fit together so nicely. BZ: When you work with teenagers, do you also generally work with their parents? And when parents come in for sessions, do the dads generally show up, too? Wisotzkey: It is always helpful as a therapist to see teens as part of a family system and to keep parents in the loop. However, since much of the work of the teen years, and many of their difficulties, are around developing their own identity and competence at being independent, they often want their therapy to be their own. It is always fun to find that balance, and most parents understand this. I often find myself in the position of interpreting parents' behaviors to their teens and teen behavior to parents in a way that keeps good will flowing!in a harmful direction? I recall my reaction also being, \"I don' t want to just sit by and watch this happen...what can I do\"? We decided to form a small business which we called ' Raising Strong and Confident Daughters'. Bill Zirinsky: Please tell us about what evolved out of your joint interest in that book? Sally Wisotzkey: The first thing Carole and I decided to do as Raising Strong and Confident Daughters was to educate ourselves and develop an educational/prevention program for parents. We piloted this at Abbot Elementary School with the support of other parents and the PTO. The parents attending found it very helpful, and we began offering the workshop in the local community as well as other locations in Michigan. From these workshops evolved monthly ongoing parent support groups for mothers, which I facilitated in my private practice office. One of these groups is still meeting after 12 years of raising our daughters and sons together, and a new group has just formed! In addition to the workshops and support groups for parents, it made sense to offer something for girls themselves. We wrote a curriculum for middle school girls called \"It's Great to be a Girl\", developed a training program for college \"femtors\", and in collaboration with Wild Swan Theater, UM, and Forsythe Middle School, we received a grant from Ann Arbor Community Foundation to pilot the program. The following year, the Michigan Women's Foundation funded moving the program to West Middle School in Ypsilanti. After collaborating with and financial support from the Huron Valley Girl Scouts, the program expanded to include East Middle School. Today, ten years later, \"It's Great to be a Girl\" holds weekly groups at both middle schools in Ypsilanti as well as in Willow Run. We have collaborations with Eastern Michigan University and University of Michigan in recruiting and training femtors. The program has strong financial support and commitment from U of M's Office of Academic Affairs, Multi Cultural Initiative. The collaborative nature of the program has been central to its success. The ongoing vitality of the program is a testament to Carole's amazing perseverance, and the program's effectiveness at providing girls the opportunity to come together and experience the validation of their self worth! The Girl Scouts Heart of Michigan has also provided many years of support for the development and provision of day long self esteem/friendship workshops for girls in grades 3 through 8. As you can see, we have been on an exciting and gratifying journey!Zirinsky: Can you tell concisely tell us about the arc of your professional career? You started in private practice in 1986? Wisotzkey: After receiving my MSW in 1977, I worked for 9 years for Plymouth Canton Community Schools. While there, I had the good fortune to work with and learn from many talented and creative individuals committed The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 34 Photo by Amy Johnston Sally and Annah -- Annah, 21, is a senior at Western Michigan University. She is majoring in psychology. \"I often find myself in the position of interpreting parents behaviors to their teens and teen behavior to parents ' in a way that keeps goodwill flowing!\"The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Sally Wisotzkey Continued from page 33It is my experience that many contemporary fathers may have grown up emotionally disconnected from their fathers, but they want to have a closer bond with their own children. They realize the value to themselves and their children of building a strong bond, and they are willing to ask for help with the communication skills necessary to have this bond. So yes, dads show up and it is rewarding work. BZ: When you have done workshops for parenting teenagers, or workshops on raising strong and confident daughters, what percentage of the parents who come to these workshops are men? Please tell us about drawing dads in. Wisotzkey: Well it is true that probably about 80% of parents showing up for workshops are mothers. Women just seem to be more interested in talking and sharing with each other about parenting. Carole has offered workshops specifically for dads. Also, we make a point in our workshops of providing specific ideas for fathers to help them stay connected to their daughters as they go from being little girls to young women. BZ: More generally, tell us about what has been most meaningful to you about those workshops, over the years, on Raising Strong and Confident Daughters. Wisotzkey: It is, without a doubt, being blessed and comforted by the sense of support and encouragement that is given and received when parents come together in the desire to be the best parents they can be to their sons and daughters. Many parents in past generations had the involvement of their own parents, aunts and uncles, and other relatives, in child raising. Today, with extended families being so dispersed, we need strong connections within our communities to find that needed support. Everyone who is a parent shares in the common humanity of the challenges of parenting and worries about our kids. It reminds me of a joke I heard recently: Two women were meeting in a park for a visit with each other. They sat on the park bench and one said to the other, \"so how are you doing?\" and the other woman responded with a deep sigh, \"oh my\". Then she asked her friend back, \" and so how are you doing?\", and her friend also responded with a deep sigh \"oh my\". And then she said, \"OK, that' s enough about the kids!\" The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 35 BZ: In the book, Girl in the Mirror - Mothers and Daughters in the Years of Adolescence , Nancy Snyderman writes, \"For many of us, switching gears as mothers is as difficult as the transition out of childhood is for our daughters\". Can you talk about that? Wisotzkey: Many mothers experience a daughter's often sudden and unanticipated change in attitude towards them as a loss... And it is. Our daughters who adored us, listened to us, sought our advice, told us about themselves and their friends can suddenly become moody, want privacy, and stop sharing the content of their lives with us. We miss the girls they were. It takes some time, and a step back, to notice it is just our daughters doing what they are supposed to do...beginning to form their own identities. It can be awkward for both mothers and their daughters. Mothers learn to listen in different ways, and learn to give their daughters the space they need to grow. Daughters learn they don't have to slam the door so hard, and find their way back to a changing relationship with their mothers. It's a process, as is all of parenting. BZ: Separate, but possibly related, Snyderman writes, \"Two important landmarks in female life - menarche and perimenopause/menopause, events that in previous generations were separated in time, will, in daughter and mother, likely overlap.\" She wrote that she and her co-author, Peg Streep, found that \"hugely important - if rarely mentioned\". To paraphrase a question raised in that book, can you talk about how the changes in daughters during adolescence affect a mother's sense of self, and conversely, how a girl's experience of adolescence is affected by where, in life, her mother finds herself? Wisotzkey: It would make sense that the life stage a mother is in will affect her experience of her daughter's adolescence, and vice versa, and I believe the experience would be unique to each mother and daughter. For example, a self confident woman in her 50's, with a young teen of 13, may experience her daughter's budding sexuality with a sense of excitement and celebration, bringing her own wisdom and sense of self to help her daughter as she grows. Another woman in the same stage of life, who has not done her own work, may feel threatened and intimidated by her daughter's youth, and the typical \"Girls are confused by the message that they can be whatever they want to be, but while they 're being, they need to be sexy. \"Photo by Amy Johnston Continued on page 36 www.vipassanahealing.com Contact: John Orr: John@vipassanaHealing.com Barbara Brodsky: Barbara@vipassanaHealing.comCome visit John of God at his Healing Center in Abadi\u00e2nia, Brazil with ofcial Casa guides: Summer, 2010 - with John Orr - dates to be nalized January 15 - 30, 2011 - with Barbara Brodskycriticism of the mom by her daughter. A woman who takes good care of herself and challenges herself to work through her own self esteem issues, will always be better equipped to parent in any life stage of her own or her daughter's. However, we know that even the healthiest of mothers and fathers will find they alone don't affect a girl's view of herself during her adolescence. More than ever before, the sheer amount of information that comes from constant media exposure rivals a parent's influence. BZ: Cultural change happens slowly. Much has changed, and much has stayed the same, in the area of sex roles, and also in the broader area of female adolescence, since the early 1970's, when you and I began college. In Snyderman's book, it says, \"We do not generally appreciate the way in which the stresses our daughters face are markedly different from our own adolescence.\" What are your thoughts about this, as a workshop leader and a therapist and also as a mother? Wisotzkey: In my opinion, the convergence of excessive media consumption and the sexualization of younger and younger girls has created a dangerous culture for our daughters. Rather than learning about healthy sexual identities from their parents and peers, girls are learning from the media that they are only valued for their \"hotness\", i.e. their bodies. Young people are bombarded with this message on TV , on the Internet, in magazines, song lyrics, video games, billboards, clothing stores. Girls are confused by the message that they can be whatever they want to be, but while they're being, they need to be sexy. And in communities like ours, girls are also under pressure to be good at sports, do volunteer work, get the best grades, play an instrument, have lots of friends, get into a great college, etc. Girls experience this as a feeling of never being enough. It shows up in my office in the forms of low self-esteem, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and substance abuse. Of course, boys are also victims of the sexualization of girls. They, too, feel pressure to compete for the \"hot\" girls, and \"hook up\" before they are emotionally ready. What girls and boys both really desire are friendships and relationships with each other where they can have someone to talk with, feel special and cared about, and safe just being themselves! BZ: You said to me that many moms and dads do not explicitly educate their children about the culture. You also noted that many parents don't even think to do the cultural deconstruction when their daughters are 10. They wait to start until they're 14, and then it's too late? Can you expand on that? Wisotzkey: Parents have many opportunities when kids are young to point out and talk about how girls are portrayed, and sexual stereotypes in the media in general. For example, many fairy tales have the beautiful princess being saved by the handsome prince...Parents can begin pointing out how silly that is to 3 and 4 year old girls. When it comes to choosing dolls, parents can have fun with girls by comparing the bodies of Barbies with real girls. As our kids age, we can have conversations on daily bases that teach kids to look critically at the media. The earlier a parent engages their children in this way, the more likely the messages will stick. I found my own children were much more open to my rantings before they were teens! There are literally hundreds of media literacy organizations on line that provide tips for parents on how to give their kids the knowledge they need to be their own media critics. Just recently I viewed the website sosexysosoon.com taken from the new book by Diane Levin and Jean Kilbourne. It had extensive ideas for parents...check it out. BZ: We live in a highly educated town, a town full of professional women. How come our girls are still so powerfully influenced by the cultural stereotypes? How do we protect our girls from the culture, and also to engage in the culture? Wisotzkey: We protect our girls from the culture by giving them knowledge about the culture... creating in them an awareness, an observing point of view, as opposed to being a blank slate... giving them the knowledge necessary to resist the stereotypes. But while we are educated and tuned into these issues, we are also women who grew up in homes with mothers and fathers in traditional roles, parents who were just beginning to see the possibilities. We were also raised in times when women were objectified. We still struggle to figure out our own self The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 36 Local Resources for Raising Daughters 1.

We still comment on how \"cute\" little girls are and pay more attention to what our girls wear than what our boys wear. We're trying to understand the meaning of our own \"inner beauty\" and focus less on our outer beauty. We are struggling with divorce and financial difficulties and working full time. We too are trying to figure out what good enough is. We too, like our daughters, are still works in progress and we bring our own strengths and frustrations to our roles as mothers. Thank goodness we're not perfect! BZ: You mentioned to me that parents often ask you to help them navigate issues related to cell phone usage, texting, social networking, television, movies, and so on. Please tell us about that, and give us some anecdotes. Wisotzkey: I read some months ago (see NYTimes.com, Room for Debate, Wired Kids, Negligent Parents? Jan. 28) that a recent Kaiser Foundation study found that kids in the U.S. between the ages of 8 and 18 spend MORE THAN 7 \u00bd HOURS A DAY on average using electronic devices, often connected to more than one at a time. That is more time than kids spend in school...way more. In addition to TV time, most is spent socializing on cell phones and computers, especially for girls. Boys are playing video games.The Crazy Wisdom Interview with Sally Wisotzkey Continued from page 35 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 37 Parents of today are challenged to find ways to support their kids' necessary use of electronics and media, while setting age appropriate limits, often very difficult to monitor. Parents often come in to my office with reports of their kids having thousands of text messages every week, at all hours of the day and night. Our community, like others everywhere, is dealing with the phenomenon of 'sexting', with kids themselves being charged with child pornography...how ironic. And then there is the issue of Internet safety for young people. Parents are trying to teach their children that electronics are there for us to use, rather than them using us. Fortunately, parents can use that same access to information to find help in how to manage their kids' electronic usage. Web sites such as Common Sense Media, Keep Kids Healthy, and Get Net Wise are available. BZ: Please talk about the kinds of issues you have to navigate with teenage girls, and their parents, related to clothes. And give us some anecdotes, if possible. Wisotzkey: Well as you can imagine, this is often a battle ground between girls and their parents, and has been through the ages. In general, parents can support girls in developing their own \"style\", as an expression of their unique selves. For example, I have a teenage client who wears scarves well, and it is her own look. The popular style for teen girls is highly sexualized, with as much cleavage as one can get out the door with! Girls see clothing through the lens of style, fitting in and being included. Parents want this for their daughters, but their lens is also about safety and self esteem. Girls are struggling themselves to fit the \"ideal\" body type. Parents need to be sensitive to their daughter's need to fit in, while pointing out and speaking up about why they find some clothing objectionable. When my daughter was a teen, we battled about 'short shorts'. I recall there were times when she was a young teen that I said no. There were times I said, \"not with my money but do what you want with your own money\". But I find the best way to handle this issue is to compliment your daughter when you feel she is wearing clothes that look good on her, and say nothing when she chooses to wear clothes you're not too fond of. BZ: You noted to me that \"I wasn't expected to be as sexual as girls are expected to be now\". And you also said that you weren't expected to have as much sexual power as girls are now expected to have. Can you elaborate on that? Wisotzkey: In the current culture, girls who are adept and sophisticated with their outward sexual appearance and behavior are rewarded with power within their social groups. They have the power of popularity, the power to get boyfriends. This is particularly true with younger teens. Unfortunately for these young women, the culture is backing them into a corner . They often lack the building blocks of true self-confidence, which are based on one' s own abilities and accomplishments, one's own sense of self, which comes from within, rather than from the attention of others. I grew up in the 60' s. Because the predominant culture and media at the time was not as sexualized, girls were not expected to gain social status from outward sexual look or behavior . BZ: You have led parent support groups for about 12 years, yes? Please tell us about them. Tell us about the kinds of support that is engendered, and about what has been most memorable about those support groups. Wisotzkey: Yes, the longest running support group for moms has been meeting monthly on Friday mornings for 12 years. We have come together to offer each other advice and support. We have come to know each other's stories intimately, we have been able to laugh at ourselves, cry, and laugh some more. We appreciate the differences among our children and our parenting styles, we have celebrated the passages of our lives and our kids lives, and we are just there for each other, nonjudgmental, encouraging each other to accept our kids for who they are. For me, it has been an honor to facilitate these groups. As I said earlier, a new support group just formed last year, and we are building the safety every parent needs to talk about their parenting experiences. It's exciting! It would be wonderful if all parents had the opportunity to be a part of a support group as they face the challenges of parenting. BZ: How do you think your daughter has been affected by her mother's involvement in these issues, and your awareness of the nuances of these issues? Wisotzkey: My daughter, who is now 21, has a great deal of self confidence and feels so very comfortable in her own skin. She used to get so annoyed with me for reminding her about how pictures of models are not real (I know Mom), giving her books upon books to read about strong girls, friendship issues, healthy bodies (I'm not going to read these Mom), telling her to \"just be yourself\"(I am Mom), and on and on. I don't really know if and how the messages got through, but I sure do like the person she has become! BZ: How do you think your son has been affected by your involvement in these issues, and your awareness of the nuances of these issues? Wisotzkey: My son just turned 19 years old. These issues are the last thing on his mind right now! However, he did spend a few minutes thinking about this question. He said he is much more aware of the issues of girls and how they are stereotyped than he would have been without my talking about it all the time. He said the most important effect my work in this area has had on him is that when he is a father, he wants to raise a girl who is strong and confident. I have no doubt he will! BZ: How do you think your husband has been affected by your deep involvement in these issues, and your expertise? Wisotzkey: Steve came into my life in 1999, when I was working long hours in developing and finding funding for all of the programs for girls, doing workshops and running girls' groups, seeing clients, and being a mom. He should have run the other way! Instead, he jumped in and has been supportive and encouraging all the way through, as a husband and also as a co-parent. Given that we both were raised in families with traditional male/female roles, we have had to work at finding our way into marital, parenting, and step-parenting roles that are a workable expression of what we learned then with who we want to be today.

I am not crazy; I just needed to tell them something. I did not go up to each one, personally, though I may decide to do this as well while I'm here. Here's what I said to them:\"I'm trying to wake up. Thank you for your patience.\" This isn't the first time I've talked to the spruce trees in this quiet wetland grove. I've been coming here for years\u2014almost every winter since I started courting my wife, some 19 years ago. Her family originates from the small towns nearby in what is affectionately called \"The Southern Tier\" of New York State, due south of Buffalo. In the late 1940's, her grandfather had the great foresight to purchase a remote, 68 acre parcel of land bordering a wetland pond and nestled in the shadows of the rippling Allegheny Mountains. He, with the help of my in-laws as dating teenagers, then planted the five thousand spruce trees\u2014 just saplings back then\u2014given to them by the Conservation Department as part of its forestation project. Needless to say, the trees have matured. They now stand tall and proud, and blanketed, on this day, in a majestic shawl of freshly fallen, wooly white snow. After her grandfather passed, my wife's family continued the wisdom that brought them this land by constructing, by hand, a small, rustic A-framed cabin in the heart of the property. They set it back in the spruce grove, adjacent to the wetland pond and oriented it towards those gently crested mountains. One of their goals while building the cabin was to knock down not one single spruce tree in the construction process. So, even today, there are no roads in here; one must simply know from experience which spruce trees to carefully weave one's vehicle between to get back to the cabin. The first time I started talking to the spruce trees, I'll admit, I probably did have \"one too many\". My wife and I take turns\u2014one week each\u2014coming here in the throes of winter for personal retreat and blessed solitude. We're both raving introverts, and as such, our idea of a good vacation includes the notion of a hefty break from one another other as well. As a Zen Buddhist for the past 23 years, I always look forward to my week of solitude as an opportunity for a lay-practitioner to try on the textured and austere life of a Zen monk, attempting to live in a seamless stream of mindfulness and quietude. In the mornings, I'm up by 4 am doing prostrations before the statue of a Buddha. By day, I sit for hours on my mat and cushion, interspersing these sittings with short periods of walking meditation, sometimes out amongst the spruces. At night, I read accounts of old Zen monks from the mountain monasteries of Korea and Tibet and Japan, some of whom were crazy as all get-out, living for years in caves or as raving lunatics in the tufts of trees! Some of them were even known to indulge, from time to time, in a flask or two of monastery-distilled whiskey or gin. Zen is like this, I've come to understand. It's rugged and simple and full of inconsistencies unknowable to the ordinary mind. In the year of my tree-talking experience, my in-laws, at the behest of my wife, had installed a twenty-seven jet hot tub out on the wood deck (so much for the \"austerity\" aspect!). The hot tub sits underneath a couple of very tall, very stoic spruce trees. At night, in the dead of winter, one can sit comfortably The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 38 in the tub underneath a breath-taking view of the shimmering stars while basking in the glow of the moon's soft luminosity. At times, one can even hear the furtive howl of a lonely band of coyotes off in the distance. It was on such a night, with a flask of Sambuca by my side, when I first heard the spruce tree \"talk\". Now, to be clear, it wasn't like the tree really talked. I may have been slightly inebriated, but I wasn't delusional. It was more like I was just sort of channeling, out loud, what it was saying. Here were the first words it spoke to me:\"We are trees.\" (This, it turns out, is always how they start off their conversations. It's a bit like, \"Yo, wassup?\" as I've come to understand it...) So...what can I say? We talked, a good long while, it and I. It told me things I never knew about trees. I told it things it never knew about humans. It talked a lot about rootedness, and the problems this presented to trees everywhere. I told it all about mobility, and the problems that this, too, presented\u2014to humans. The most fascinating thing was, each of us perceived the other one's greatest strength to be exactly the elixir to its own species' troubles. \"When the storms come,\" it told me, \"we have no choice. We have to face whatever it is. Some of us make it, but the old and the diseased ones...sometimes they don't. You...you don't have this problem. When the storms come, you get in your mobility carts and steal away.\" \"Yes,\" I said back, \"but look at it this way. If you had one of those mobility carts and could simply run away all the time, you'd never have to face anything tough in life. You think that's a blessing, but actually, it is not. The problem with humankind is, in fact, its mobility. We think it is always better somewhere else. So, we go ahead tearing up the planet in search of this better place, and we do it over and over again. If we were simply rooted in the earth, like you, we couldn't possibly be ruining the planet the way we are.\" We went on talking like this a while. And why not? One of the great gifts of a solitary retreat in a remote and desolate outpost is the ability one has to take \"certain liberties\" with the otherwise agreed-upon parameters of sanity and social graces. In our haste to \"get along\" with one another by adhering to the fixed terms of our conventions, how quickly we forego the magical, the mysterious, the infinite realms of substratum that lay just outside of those convention walls. Swaying in the Sangha of Trees I now return to this magical (spruce) grove every year with the sense that I am a temporary visitor in what, essentially, is their sacred \"sangha\"\u2014or spiritual community, as it is referred to in Buddhist circles. They are the resident monks of this timeless arboreal shrine, and though I am a welcomed guest here, I am, from their humble perspective, nothing more than a \"rootless wonder\": ambulatory, headstrong, and in search of something they cannot grasp. So, while some might call my tree-talking experience something akin to utter \"lunacy,\" and others might dismiss it as simply the \"Sambuca talking,\" the question I would ask is, ultimately, does it matter by which means we come to discover our unshakable interconnectedness to all life? The transformative aspect of such experiences indelibly saturates the soul. We cannot help but bring the fruits of such experiences home with us, long after our time of solitude has ended. From this standpoint, I would argue that those who would talk with trees would find it impossible, from that day forward, to shear them off at the knees for profit and greed. \"So, my brethren and I were wondering,\" it asked me further into our conversation, \"what is it that you do here, anyway?\" \"Well, to be perfectly honest,\" I said, trying to think like a tree, \"I guess I come here to try to grow my roots.\" \"Grow your roots?\" it chortled. \"You have no roots!\"\"Well, no, not like yours,\" I said back. \"What I mean is, I'm just trying to learn to be still\u2014like the way you are\u2014rather than constantly running from thing to thing, the way humans do.\" \"Be still...and grow your roots?\" it blurted impossible!\" asked. \"Why?\" \"You have to sway,\" it replied.\"Sway?\" I said, uncertain of its gist. \"Of course, sway. Do you sway?\"I thought about this a while. In my sitting meditation I've often noticed myself\u2014just ever so slightly\u2014moving from side to side from time to time. I don't know why I do it, it just sort of happens sometimes. I kind of like it, so I don't try to regulate it in any particular way. \"Come to think of it,\" I said, finally, \"I guess I do sway!\"\"That's good!\" it said back to me. \"Then, you are your roots!\" \"I am?\" I said, \"How so?\" \"Well,\" it said back to me, \"when the storms come, we start swaying. We sway from top to bottom, so what sways high, always sways low\u2014that is the ancient law of swaying, after all. This may be hard for you to see but, below ground, in our roots, we are also swaying. You see, everything is interconnected this way. This swaying underground loosens up the soil that we are rooted in, and this loosening of the soil makes it possible for our roots to grow bigger around.\" \"Wow, I never knew that,\" I said back, amazed. Thinking about it further, I observed, \"So, if it weren't for the storms, you might not be as big as you are today, right?\" \"True enough,\" it agreed. \"Still, that doesn't mean we enjoy the storms, or that it makes it easy.\" \"I understand,\" I said. \"I think we have an expression for this sort of thing. It goes, 'whatever doesn't kill ya, makes ya stronger'.\" It most heartily agreed.Ever since my initial \"conversation\" in the hot tub with the spruce tree\u2014call it what you will\u2014I now return to this magical grove every year with the sense that I am a temporary visitor in what, essentially, is their sacred \"sangha\"\u2014or spiritual community, as it is referred to in Buddhist circles. They are the resident monks of this timeless arboreal shrine, and though I am a welcomed guest here, I am, from their humble perspective, nothing more than a \"rootless wonder\": ambulatory, headstrong, and in search of something they cannot grasp. They watch me as I amble to and fro, out to my truck parked by the road and then off to the grocery store or to the laundromat, head stuffed with useless jargon, lists of lists, regrets of yesterday, hopes for tomorrow. Each year, they laugh at me, referring to my year apart from them as, \"my year of chasing the wild gander.\" They think it is the funniest thing they've ever heard that I leave and come back every year to try to grow my roots. \"They start growing, and the next thing we know, you're back in your mobility cart, yanking them right out again. Then, we don't see you for another year. You come back, and you're trailing all these dead and trampled roots behind you, telling us you're back again to grow your roots. It' s the funniest thing we've ever seen! We keep wanting to say, 'Well, what do you suppose is going to happen when you yank your roots out like you do every year, over and over again?'\" I try to explain to them that I'm trying to grow my spiritual roots no matter where I am, here or elsewhere, but they don't get this. \"If you can't stay in one place for more than a week, then how do you expect to grow anything whatsoever?\" they ask. To this, I have no good answer. I find it difficult to sit still in my meditation sessions for more than thirty minutes at a time. Then, I have to get up, walk around, stretch out, do the dishes, write essays and a billion other things on my list of things to do, before I can meditate again. I make it part of my practice, though, to walk slowly among them, palms together, breathing deeply, smiling and thanking each one for their great example and service during my stay. They\u2014the trees\u2014are truly the masters of rootedness, and I, their humble disciple, come here each year to learn from them their fantastic resilience and fortitude. In Zen practice, we are asked to be still long enough to see with utter clarity just how our thoughts and emotions help shape our reality. We can't really do this if we're constantly on the go, physically or otherwise. So, we pull up a mat and a cushion\u2014or a decent straight-backed chair, if one prefers\u2014and we park it. We breathe deeply and we watch. In time, with practice, the picture of our lives begins to clear . We have been so inundated in it, we've yet to witness it as if from afar. What we see, often times, is hauntingly depressing. And yet, it is a start. For there is hardly a hope of changing anything if we remain in the \"inundated\" state. With the great resilience of the trees, who stand bravely in one place no matter the circumstance, we get hit with the gale force winds of our own existence. Sometimes we even break, the force is that strong! But mostly , I would guess that, after talking with the trees, what we do is learn to sway . And when we sway with the brilliance and starkness of whatever comes up in our meditation practice, the soil of that which binds us and imprisons us is loosened. In this loosening, the roots of our true selves are finally freed and allowed to grow bigger around, just like the spruce trees. So, this is the wisdom that my sangha of trees has imparted to me through my years of solitary retreat. This morning, while walking slowly among them, I asked them, once again, for their patience. This path of unraveling the true self takes time\u2014more time than I ever imagined! In a few more days, I'll once again get into my \"mobility cart\" and hightail it out of here, back home to Michigan. I'll try my best to hold onto this vast wisdom until my next return visit, one stormy cycle around the sun from now. And, hopefully, I'll try to keep swaying with whatever happens to come up for me till then. May we all be so fortunate at some point in our lifetimes to be in the company of a lively band of trees. And hopefully, we can all learn to make our sway a dance! ### (Leonard Bass lives and works in Ann Arbor, and is a member of the Zen Buddhist Temple on Packard.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 39 In time, with (Zen) practice, the picture of our lives begins to clear. We have been so inundated in it, we've yet to witness it as if from afar. What we see, often times, is hauntingly depressing. And yet, it is a start. For there is hardly a hope of changing anything if we remain in the \"inundated\" state. By Diane Kimball Illustration by Dianne Austin The snake hangs like a sloth on the wooden brace of the dock. A warm September sun has lulled it into lassitude. Close by I settle quickly into the kayak, pushing off into the quiet pond here in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. A white heron guards the entrance to the river. He flies off unexpectedly as if to lead the way. The river appears iced with green dots of algae. My paddle strokes leave little trace of any intrusion. Suddenly a shimmer of silver lands in my lap. What' s this? A fish flip-flops there, as startled as I am. He wriggles for a few seconds before I gently grab his body and hurry him back to the river. Touching a fish's scaled body is nothing new or uncomfortable to me. Most often, however, the fish ended up on the table. \"Just one more seine,\" my brother would say. Around we'd go again with the net, grabbing a whole bucket more of minnows. \"Just one more fish,\" he would plead. I'd already caught a dozen perch and he wanted to catch more than I did. The Ontario summer sun baked our kid bodies; we caught perch and baked them. The afternoon would be a long one. I would scrape and scale the fish, my brother the master of gutting and filleting. My mother would soak them in milk, dry them, and then scatter breadcrumbs over the filets. Oven-baked, tasting like the very fresh water we'd hauled them from that morning on Lake St. Clair. Today, on the river, fish in lap, fish thrown out of lap, fish returned to its water life. I'm not superstitious. But I choose to be now. I've been diagnosed with a large thing on the inside of my right kidney. This demon thing. I can't see you if you hide . Tell me what you want. Right kidney, to leave, tells me to live every moment as if it's for the first time. Left kidney, to remain, says get out of your own fucking way . Fish in lap, fish thrown out of lap, fish returned to its water life. The snake slithered down from its perch and printed trails across the surface of the water as it disappeared into the reeds. Benign, after all. ### (Diane Kimball lives in Ann Arbor and is a writer, musician, and educator.

Children's Book Reviews By Sarah Newland, mother of two (ages three and eleven) and devoted parent of Waldorf education Emily and Daisy by Elsa Beskow Elsa Beskow's numerous picture books for children have been known and loved for over a century. In this new publication, Emily is going to the meadow to look after Daisy the cow and meets some elves along the way. This is a beautiful view into traditional Swedish farming life and a gentle story about a young girl, for ages 3-7. $17.95 by Floris Books Growing Green: A Young Person's Guide to Taking Care of the Planet by Christina Goodings with illustrations by Masumi FurukawaThis book will help children learn about simple ways to take care of our world by tending to small creatures, nurturing seeds, picking up trash, and recycling. The pastel artwork makes this book extremely appealing and helps children identify with these larger issues. My son, who is almost four, loves this book (especially the camping page!) even though it's probably written for slightly older children, ages 4-10. $12.95 by Lion Hudson My Little Red Book by Kauder-Nalebuff This is an anthology of stories about first periods, collected from women of all ages from around the world. The accounts range from lighthearted (the editor got hers while waterskiing in a yellow bathing suit) to heart-stopping (a first period discovered just as one girl was about to be strip-searched by the Nazis). The contributors include well-known women writers, such as Erica Jong and Gloria Steinem, alongside today' s teens. Ultimately, this book is a call for a change in attitude. By revealing what it feels like to under go this experience firsthand and giving women the chance to explain their feelings in their own words, My Little Red Book aims to provide support, entertainment, and a starting point for discussion for mothers and their girls. It will be the perfect gift for my daughter's First Moon celebration (but I'm reading it first, and it's great!).$14.99 by Twelve Books Baking Bread with Children by Warren Lee Cohen With a little know-how, anyone can transform a few basic ingredients into a delicious, sustaining loaf of bread. This book has everything you need to know to share the magic of baking bread with children of all ages. In the Waldorf tradition, the techniques and recipes are cleverly seasoned with stories, songs, and poems to make the whole process really enjoyable for everyone. The Cheesy Snails are super fun, the braided Harvest Spelt Bread looks very special to children (and is easy to make), and now I can finally find the recipe for Santa Lucia Buns for December 13 th! I'm currently making the 14-day sourdough starter for the Old World Rye Bread, and I can't wait to try it.

Adele Kieras: Every individual has unlimited potential within. When children engage in this ancient practice of yoga, they readily connect with their inner strengths and see themselves as worthy beings. They fully enjoy being themselves and being with others. To share in this is truly gratifying. BZ: I know you have a background as an educator. How did you get into teaching yoga to kids? Adele Kieras: Working with children, I have long been aware of how health and nutrition affect their ability to acquire knowledge, optimal health for the brain and body to fully develop. I discovered yoga when I returned to college for a master's degree in nutrition. The first time I moved my body in the space on my yoga mat, I felt how this practice is a natural fit with children. Children are strong kinesthetic learners. They learn by doing. They gain self-knowledge while having fun practicing yoga. What is most remarkable about teaching yoga to 3-6 year olds? And what is most worthy to note about teaching yoga to 6-10 year olds? Kieras: Yoga for the 3 -6 year old is playful and energetic; however, the relaxation portion of a yoga class with 3 -6 year olds is amazing. It is so comforting to view a group of three and four-year-olds lying relaxed and still. Yes, I said still , on their mats, with peaceful expressions on their faces. More then that, they love the experience even more than I do. Students in the 6 - 10 year old class often come in feeling a bit unsure, lacking confidence and even slightly scared. Over the 6 to 8 weeks of a class session there is a dramatic shift in their sense of well being. They become comfortable in their own skins, feel good about keeping themselves physically, mentally and emotionally healthy, and enjoy expressing themselves, fully being who they are. They courageously move into backbends and powerfully lift themselves up into handstands, then use their breath to calm themselves into relaxation. They are amazing. Girl Scouts can get a yoga patch nowadays? Kieras: The Girl Scout program now includes a \"Be Healthy, Be Fit\" unit where Girl Scouts have the opportunity to earn badges for engaging in healthy lifestyle choices and activities. Included in this program is a Yoga Patch that Junior Girl Scouts earn by attending yoga classes. For Brownie Girl Scouts there is a My Body Try-it, which promotes healthy movement and yoga practices. What's most challenging about working with kids doing yoga? Kieras: Children are so enthusiastic when they come to yoga class I am often bombarded by requests to do this pose, that pose, rainbow breathing, yogi bender game, partner poses, etc! It is a challenge to move them (and myself, I get caught in their buoyant energy) into a more calm receptive state in order to move through poses in a beneficial sequence. Then we develop patience to wait until the next week to get to poses that we could not fit into the one-hour class. Please tell us about partner poses? Kieras: Once students have a basic understanding of foundational poses and breathing techniques, I introduce them to partner poses. Working together is so much fun for all of us. Practicing yoga with others develops self-control, social awareness and spatial dynamics. It teaches children how to respectfully and supportively interact and connect with others. It also teaches how to appreciate differences and have fun as they build community. Questions for Adele Kieras about T eaching Yoga to Kids The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 42 Tess Dombrowski and Eleanor Niman \"Through practicing yoga, children develop the life long practice of listening to their bodies and making healthy choices to keep their bodies and minds feeling.\" Children are so enthusiastic when they come to yoga class I am often bombarded by requests to do this pose, that pose, rainbow breathing, yogi bender game, partner poses, etc! Adele Kieras Photo courtesy of Inward BoundThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2010 Page 43 What are the possible longer-term benefits for starting kids into yoga at an early age? Kieras: The American Medical Association has identified two key factors for maintaining good health (physically and emotionally). They are: self-awareness and self-care. Through practicing yoga, children develop the life long practice of listening to their bodies and making healthy choices to keep their bodies and minds feeling well. Where in the Ann Arbor region will you be doing Kids Yoga classes this spring? Kieras: This spring I am offering yoga classes for children at Inward Bound Yoga Studio and at the Ann Arbor Jewish Community Center. I also offer classes at Rasa Yoga in Novi, and look forward to developing a kids yoga program at the Ann Arbor YMCA in the near future. www.ibyoga.com for Inward Bound Yoga, www.jccannarbor.org for the Jewish Community Center, www.rasa-yoga.com for Rasa Yoga, or contact me, Adele Kieras, at kyogaoftheheart@aol.com or 248-931-0773. You moved to this area from San Diego a year and a half ago. What are your strongest impressions of life here in southeastern Michigan? Kieras: I really enjoy the outdoors and spend as much time as possible in nature. It has been a true pleasure to breathe in the fresh air of Michigan woods, and to enjoy being around and in the waters of lakes and rivers. I appreciate being able to live in a community that is progressive in its commitment to the environment. What ar e you most looking forward to this spring? Kieras: I look forward to sharing in the abundance that nature and all life has to offer. For me this is the best time to bring the practice of yoga outdoors. Not only do I hold classes outdoors, we extend the classes into planting gardens and cleaning up areas for the animals. ### (Shown from bottom right, \"Practicing yoga with others develops self-control, social awareness and spatial dynamics.

Fourth Ave. Ann Arbor info@easternsunshiatsu.com 734-417-9714 Jomon Stretch Classes 5-Element Muscle Balance Zen Meridian ExercisesFalling Awake: Mindfulness for Depression and Anxiety Bill Zirinsky: Lynn, you've been teaching a class called Falling Awake: Mindfulness for Depression and Anxiety . Tell us about it. Lynn Sipher: The class is centered around the idea that we are often living on automatic pilot: our minds in one place, our bodies in another . Autopilot is what happens when we hear a person's name one minute and can't remember it the next or when we have just finished eating a snack and don' t remember eating. In Falling Awake classes, people living with depression and anxiety are learning to become more aware of their moment-to-moment experience without judging it. Many people who live with anxiety and depression believe they are only too aware of these states. What they discover, however, is that these states actually creep in subtly when they are on autopilot; when they aren't paying attention. Once people have awareness that anxiety and depression are present, this approach helps them create a space to decide what they are going to do next. Falling Awake is built on two therapeutic approaches: Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy for Depression (MBCT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). BZ: Are your classes for people in the midst of a depressive episode? And are your classes group therapy? Lynn Sipher: People in the midst of a depressive episode will probably not have the mental energy or motivation to practice sitting meditation and other exercises that help build awareness. The class is designed for people who are feeling better than they once were after an episode of depression and want to build skills to prevent another possible episode. Unless someone is too anxious to be in class, most anyone with anxiety can benefit. The classes are educational and practical in nature. I teach formal and informal skills of mindfulness. Falling Awake is not a substitute for individual therapy nor is it group therapy. You mentioned to me that in your classes, you are encouraging people to not cultivate meanness toward their anxiety and depression, and to notice their experiences and be curious about them. Can you elaborate on that, and in doing so, share with us the essence of what you are trying to offer people who come to your 8-week class on Mindfulness for Depression and Anxiety? Sipher: What I invite in Falling Awake is a kind, compassionate, patient, and accepting approach to what is happening inside of us; what is already there. It only makes things worse if we are feeling lousy and then beat ourselves up about it; or think we shouldn't be experiencing what we are experiencing. Mindfulness cultivates a non-adversarial relationship to symptoms. If a symptom is there, we might allow it to come and go. We may learn, for example, to become curious about the ways the intensity changes or become aware of the ways it manifests in our bodies. It seems the more present andaware we are as we go through unpleasant experiences, the less \"hold\" they have on us. It's a radical idea. Try it with an itch sometime. Using mindfulness, you can actually ride the waves of an itch without scratching it. You mentioned to me that people who suffer from depression are living with a chronic condition, and that \"people are often fused with their depression.\" What do you mean by that, and what kind of exercises might you do, in the class, related to that insight? Sipher: People living with anxiety and depression often identify with these conditions as if it is all of who they are. \"I am depressed.\" \"I have anxiety.\" One exercise that helps separate them from identifying so closely with these conditions is being able to name the specific thoughts that are associated with them. \"I'm a failure\" and \"I'm weak\" are can't handle it\" and \"What if...?\" are common for anxiety. Stepping back from these sweeping thoughts and recognizing them as simple mental events, not facts, is a practice that gives thoughts less power. Do people in the class learn to meditate? And, if so, what kind of meditation? Sipher: People in the class learn mindfulness meditation approaches every week. Mindfulness meditation is likened to a searchlight, illuminating what is in the field of awareness. Thoughts, feelings, body sensations, impulses and urges, and memories may arise. Our task is to notice what' s in the field and gently bring ourselves back to the vehicle for meditation, which is often the breath. Is it satisfying for you to be working with depression and anxiety in this manner? Sipher: I love teaching this class! I love witnessing people waking up to a different relationship with depression and anxiety. It's great to watch the unfolding understanding that depression and anxiety are simply aspects of the internal landscape at any given moment. They can live their lives fully, according to what they value, even if anxiety and depression are present. I am observing people becoming less oppressed by these conditions. It is an honor and privilege and, actually, a bit of a thrill to witness these kinds of shifts. I know you were recently at a weeklong training on this subject. Please tell us a bit about that. Sipher: The training was designed for mental health professionals interested in learning how to teach MBCT. There was an emphasis on facilitators having a personal mindfulness practice. We spent many hours in silence: meditating, mindful movement and even eating. Between periods of silence, the teaching/training happened. Over the last day and a half, we taught each other. We had the support and supervision of the three trainers, one of whom was Zindel Segal, Ph.D. -- a researcher and author of MBCT. Can you elaborate on the distinction between a mindfully informed therapy practice, and mindfulness-based psychotherapy? Sipher: In a mindfully informed practice, therapists have their own mindfulness practices and often read literature on mindfulness and psychotherapy. The knowledge from those activities informs their work. Clients would not necessarily realize this influence any more than other Psychotherapist Lynn Sipher \"Mindfulness cultivates a non-adversarial relationship to symptoms.\" The Mindful Way through Depression by Williams, Teasdale, Segal and Kabat-Zinn. This book includes a CD with meditations by Kabat-Zinn. Full Catastrophe Living by Jon Kabat-Zinn. The original book on mindfulness-based stress reduction. Calming Your Anxious Mind by Jeffery Brantley. A mindful approach to anxiety. (These books are available at Crazy Wisdom.)The Crazy Wisdom Calendar 3 Books on Mindful Approaches to Anxiety and DepressionThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August Page 60influences unless they asked specifically. In mindfulness-based psychotherapy, therapists are teaching specific mindfulness skills (such as sitting meditation) during sessions. How long have you been meditating?Sipher: Since 2001.How has a regular meditation practice changed your own daily life, and how has it affected or deepened your life overall? Sipher: I find that I am less reactive to life's inevitable difficulties. When unpleasant events arise, I am more accepting of the way things are in the moment and paying more attention to my internal responses. I am able to more calmly think through my choices. One of these choices may be to focus on the breath, which creates a little more space for the mind and body to tap into the wisdom inherently there. What do you most love about Ann Arbor in the springtime?Sipher: I look forward to getting back to the Farmer's Market after winter hibernation. I enjoy seeing the growers with their newly budding plants and the possibilities they represent. I love supporting local vendors. Sometimes I just go for a sensory massage: colors, textures, and smells. It's also fun bumping into people I know. I appreciate being part of this community. ### (Lynn Sipher, LMSW can be reached at 734-332-3365 or www. lynnsipher.com) \"I love witnessing people waking up to a different relationship with depression and anxiety.\"The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August Page 61 Lynn Sipher's Falling Awake class will next be offered starting on September 30th.

Her arrival here is in response to a restlessness she feels, which has compelled her to come to the evening's Soul Essence Evolving workshop. Soul Essence Evolving (SEE) is a Systemic Constellation Approach to healing. It was born out of the work of Bert Hellinger, a pioneer of Systemic Family Constellations. Hellinger, a German ex-priest with a diverse background in psychotherapy and family therapy, is a leader in integrating body-based experience with the therapeutic process. Constellation work helps remove emotional, mental, physical, or spiritual blocks that keep people stuck in discontent in a way that is uniquely different from other forms of healing and therapy. Systemic Constellation work is still relatively new in the United States. Jane McLaren, a local Avatar Master and Reiki practitioner, introduced me to the process when she offered training by Dr. Ed Lynch, a student of Hellinger's. I was intrigued by its integration of sacred/intuitive energy healing with psychological principles. It is a perfect fit for my life's journey: clairvoyant from birth, degree in psychology, hands-on healer, intuitive, life coach and teacher. Jane became my partner in Systemic Constellation work three years ago, after we trained in the process for two years. Then we began to personalize, combine, and evolve the work into our own SEE processes. SEE, Soul Essence Evolving, is the umbrella for three types of constellation processes that we use. All three SEE processes involve a client, a facilitator, and sometimes a group of participants known as the gallery. V olunteers for the work, called \"representatives,\" are chosen from gallery. A particular space in the room is designated as a symbolic \"knowing field,\" which represents the energy field through which all wisdom is available to all living things. The job of the representatives is to respond to the intuitive thoughts and feelings that come up for them as they stand in the knowing field, in response to the process being used. To participate as a representative requires no special training, just a willingness to be open and authentic in revealing what comes up during the process. People show up for Soul Essence Evolving workshops without knowing what part they will play . All three SEE processes are \"blinds,\" which means that various aspects of the work are kept from the participants, so they cannot project reactions based in logic. The idea is that individuals will see their challenge and resolution unfold before them through the movements, words, and reactions of the representatives. The feeling nature of all participants is where the transformation takes place. For the session I facilitated for Michele, we talked privately about her issue and decided on which process to use. I recorded key words about her journey on individual sheets of paper. Then the representatives were brought into the room and Michele placed the papers writing-side down on the floor in the knowing field, anywhere she felt guided. Without realizing it, Michele recreated a picture resembling the Coliseum in Rome, using approximately 75 sheets of paper to represent the seats and the stands. It was an amazing replication, probably a past-life recall. She was overwhelmed with deep emotion, not really knowing why. There was a story in the picture that Michele created that held the Deb Foggio is the owner of the Center for Integrative Well Being in Plymouth.Soul Essence Evolving (SEE): Revelations from the Universe to You key to her beliefs and decisions about her presenting issue. In some way , it is not important to know what the story is, but just to know it is there. Once Michele was done, the representatives began to move the papers, still face down, following their inner urgings. Sometimes they eliminated papers, or repositioned them where they felt guided. Michele felt resistance at first, but then began to participate. Eventually, a new constellation was formed and a new path for Michele was revealed. Together, we all came to a knowing when the new constellation was fully created. The papers were turned over one by one, unveiling the healing new truths, attitudes, feelings and possibilities that had already begun ener getically to take root in Michele's life. Michele saw and felt the intricate patterns she was releasing, replacing them with the new energies that she began to embrace with her new constellation. Healing on some level was acquired by everyone in the room, whether they were the client, a representative, an observer in the gallery, or even the facilitator. Michele later says what she received from doing Soul Essence Evolving constellation work is invaluable. She came to the workshop because of the struggle she was having pursuing the career she wanted. \"After doing a few Soul Essence Evolving constellation workshops, I discovered why. But most importantly, I felt different.\" This past year, Michele began working in her chosen field. Where doors were closed, they are now open. That is the gift of systemic constellations.

I was ready to let go of a career as a classical violist and move on to something less, well...torturous. And I'd certainly tried a lot of things. It started with a repetitive stress injury in college that morphed into a tremor in my left hand. I'd always been a natural player, but the protective mechanisms I built up around this injury persisted for years, robbing me of my former ease and spontaneity. And yet I persisted through two performance degrees and into freelance orchestral life. Meanwhile, I developed a nasty case of depression and anxiety. But with Feldenkrais, I began to think differently about my situation. Here were minimal movements making huge physical changes and bringing sensation where none was before. Chronic tensions melted away. I felt what it's like to be truly kind to myself in movement, to work within my limits rather than frantically pushing at their edges, and to give authority to my own experience in the moment, not compare myself to anyone else. The Feldenkrais Method uses movement and sensation to re-train the body to function more efficiently and skillfully. In group Awareness Through Movement\u00ae lessons, participants are verbally guided through a precisely-structured sequence of movements while their attention is brought to different places in the body, different ways of doing movements, and how to bring qualities of ease and connectedness into these very novel patterns. In hands-on, one-on-one Functional Integration\u00ae lessons, Feldenkrais practitioners communicate the qualities of ease and skill through touch and passive movement. Because both types of lessons work at the level of the nervous system, the Feldenkrais Method is great at unscrambling holding patterns and habitual tensions that get people stuck and vulnerable to injury. As a classically trained musician, I recognized not just the benefits of this method, but the rare depth and artistry of it. Here was a discipline that carried infinite possibilities for both my own cultivation and for helping others. One year after my first lesson, I entered Feldenkrais professional teacher training. Over the course of the 800-hour intensive program, both my movements and my personality took on a more natural quality. As my body became less rigid, I began to explore some of the ways I'd protected myself from really living. For example, I could feel how my posture related to the assumptions and emotional landscape of my family. I noticed how allowing my ribs to move with breath related directly to permission to being more myself in the world. By re-educating my body, I amplified my emotional intelligence tenfold! Ultimately, my tremor went away. Not to mention the \"fringe\" benefits of running faster, standing taller, and having all sorts of little kinks worked out. I now walk my own jaunty walk, and continue to learn and improve weekly. Finding new movement patterns is positively addictive, because I'm always experiencing my body, and therefore life, in a new way. I recently asked my students whether they missed our weekly class when I was on vacation. I got a resounding \"YES!\" Two clients shared their stories with me: \"I am so glad that I joined your classes this past year. When I first started taking Feldenkrais, I was unable to lie on my back with my legs straight out without excruciating pain in my lower back. A lot of that was due to the fact that thr ough daily life and working out, I was forcing my body to do things that hurt more than helped. I now feel that I have a better understanding of how to let my parts work together as one, instead of trying to force them to do my bidding. I no longer have difficulty lying on my back...I feel that I am definitely on the road to recovery.\"\u2014 Joan Miller \"After our last Feldenkrais session, I sat in my car and cried...for joy at being completely pain-free for the first time in many, many years. I have a debilitating myofacial pain disorder that has left me in nearly constant pain for the last ten years. The treatment for it has been a collection of painkillers, which only mask the pain and never really take it away, not to mention the numerous bad side effects. So, imagine my joy at discovering that Feldenkrais is actually getting to the sour ce of the pain and alleviating it! Just a month ago, I was able to for ego the Botox injections I've been getting in my head, neck, shoulders, and upper back every thr ee months for years. I can't begin to thank you for this priceless gift, and can't imagine ever NOT doing Feldenkrais! Thanks again for all you've done for me. It is nothing short of giving me back my life.\" \u2014 Kar en Cass ### (Joanna Myers MM, GCFP has been teaching Feldenkrais\u00ae classes and workshops since 2002. In her private practice, she combines the Feldenkrais Functional Integration\u00ae method with energy healing, Core Transformation, and Flower Essences.

Teachers, Lecturers, Workshop Leaders and the CentersThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August Page 93Jonathan Ellis: Tahnahga, I know you have tribal connections both in the Northeast and the Midwest. Can you tell us about your ancestral background? Tahnahga Myers: I was born a Taino, Bear Clan Mohawk woman in upstate New York. For 23 years, I have worked with various elders throughout the Midwest and Northeast. These teachings are based in Mohawk and Anishinabe cultural ways of life that encompass the understanding that all things are interconnected. Through this understanding one begins a journey of reverence for self and all life forms. I am an activist for the on-going of the people. Jonathan Ellis: You have moved to Ann Arbor and are offering Native American wisdom teachings to both individuals and groups. Can you tell us about that? Tahnahga Myers: When I meet with individuals or groups, I support them to reconnect with the sacredness of place and nature that provides an antidote to the psychic pain and isolation so pervasive in present life. I use hands-on environmental experiences to enable individuals to cultivate a deeply personal relationship with the Universal Circle of Life while learning to quiet internal distractions. JE: What might bring people to work with you? Tahnahga Myers: I can guide people to feel more rooted in their ongoing life journey. I help folks cultivate their ability to speak, live and honor their Truth in alignment with their life purpose. I am committed to sharing with others how a spiritual way of life does not have to be bound Questions for Tahnahga Myers about her Native American Ancestral Teachings by dogma. I teach how to live each day as a blessing and how to experience the gift of another breath, another day of life. I call this approach, \"One Mind, One Heart, One Spirit, One Soul.\" JE: Can you give us some examples of what might happen in individual sessions with you?Tahnahga Myers \"I teach how to live each day as a blessing and how to experience the gift of another breath, another day of life.

After a first session, I might give them an assignment such as spending time walking in nature to smell, hear, touch and feel the trees, the wind, to feel the ground, the soil, the grass, then lay down on the ground and look up at the sky and passing clouds. The purpose behind this is to help the individual to begin the journey of silence within, to open their heart space and quiet the mind. JE: Many of your programs for groups also take place outdoors. Tahnahga Myers: These are guided explorations of self and spirit that include an inner journey through outdoor activities, reconnecting with Spirit through our relationship with the environment and each other, including reflection and integration time. From this place of balance comes an awakening of our inner spirit. For instance, one workshop theme is the fire within, understanding fire and our ancient relationship, fire as the origins of life, fire as birth and reformulation, fire as our spiritual path. In groups, I work to encourage a sense of awareness that you are not alone, that you are part of the web of life, and what happens to one happens to all of us. I lead workshops in building Mound gardens and designing medicine wheel gardens, as well as on making a relationship with the tall ones, the trees. Through these kinds of experiences, a person will learn how to work through their fear and doubts about being with self. You have served as an independent consultant and trainer to local and national agencies throughout the U.S. How did you come to be doing that work? Tahnahga Myers: In 1991, I created the Tree of Peace, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping native women, youth, and communities. From that work, I went on to offer counseling, training, program development, restorative justice and group facilitation for Native American and non-native communities around the country. Another focus for you has been preserving Indigenous heirloom seeds.Tahnahga Myers: Native American heirloom seeds hold the key to life; without it there would be no life, no on-going of the people. Because these are heirloom seeds, they hold sustenance to nourishing one' s life. When you are holding 800 year-old seeds in your hand, once again they are in the world. How do I plant these seeds, how do I nurture these seeds, what do these seeds need to live and grow. What happens is, the seeds teach you how to nurture them, as we learn to nurture ourselves. You are also a performing artist and have written and produced plays and given poetry and storytelling readings. What is involved? Tahnahga Myers: My plays bring together many different art forms - painting, beadwork, traditional dance, poetry, music and audio art. The plays express the balance, harmony and inherent responsibilities of the spirit in today's world. My poetry and storytelling explores the cycles of life, and reflects my Native American spirituality remembered through vision and dreaming. You will be adding your particular ancestral teachings to the wonderful pool of wisdom offerings in Ann Arbor that have come from many places around the world. Your own traditions are of course \"native\" to this land. Tahnahga Myers: I do find in other cultural teachings similarities with \"I lead workshops in building Mound gardens and designing medicine wheel gardens, as well as on making a relationship with the tall ones, the trees.\" Natasha Schaffer is a certified Yoga Meets Dance facilitator and has been teaching, dancing, and practicing yoga for 12 years.

Liberty Road (734) 663-3842Changing the cultural landscape of Southeastern Michigan. A deep and abiding commitment to positive transformation, of oneself, one's community and the world, is the heart of the Human Enrichment Project. Establishing Human Enrichment Zones where individuals can gather resources, talents and eorts to create models for sane and sustainable living is what we do. Sidestepping the old clich\u00e9s of \"personal versus social\" or \"local versus global\" we envision value webs of interconnected projects that arise from the passionate response of individuals to this culturally dicult time. Blessed unrest gives rise to sacred activism in compassion's holistic vision, forging links between urban farming, arts, spirituality, environment, education, and more. The /f_irst Human Enrichment Zone at Tsogyelgar is a loose aliation of more than 100 deeply committed individuals in this area and around the world. Doctors, lawyers, artisans, craftsmen, clergy, businessmen, retreat yogis, chefs, therapists and graphic designers\u2014working together to incarnate the good, the true, and the beautiful.
