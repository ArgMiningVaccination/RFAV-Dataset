The 17 Best Hair Growth Shampoos Longer, stronger hair starts in the shower By Iman Balagam Delmaine Donson//Getty Images Do you ever feel like your hair just refuses to grow longer, no matter what supplements you take or products you try? You're not alone. Countless factors can impact the growth and length of hair, from your genes to your scalp's health and even your daily routine. If you've already consulted a dermatologist and made hair-health tweaks to your diet, then a hair growth shampoo might just be the answer. Hair growth shampoos are formulated with a blend of nourishing ingredients to restore your hair's natural ability to grow new, healthy strands. \"Hair growth shampoos work by delivering ingredients to the scalp that stimulate the hair follicles, and/or extend the active phase of the hair growth cycle\u2014the anagen phase\u2014to increase hair growth,\" explains board-certified dermatologist Dendy Engelman.
