Natural products represent one of the most important reservoirs of structural and chemical diversity for the generation of leads in the drug development process. A growing number of researchers have shown interest in the development of drugs based onChinese herbs. In this review, the use and potential of omic technologies as powerful tools in the modernization of traditional Chinese medicine are discussed. The analytical combination fro m each omic approach is crucial for understanding the working mechanisms of cells, tissues, organs, and organisms as well as the mechanisms of disease. Gradually, omic approaches have beenintroduced in every stage of the drug development process to gen erate high-quality Chinese medicine-based drugs. Finally, the future picture of the use of omic technologies is a promising tool and arena for further improvement in the modernization of traditionalChinesemedicine. 1. Natural Products and Traditional Chinese Medicine in Drug Discovery Sinceancienttimes,plantshavebeenanessentialelementfor the prevention and treatment of a wide variety of diseases.Historically, natural products represent one of the mostimportantreservoirsofstructuralandchemicaldiversityforthe generation of leads in the drug development process[1, 2]. The tendency to develop drugs from natural sourcescan be clearly observed in a study of the sources of drugsbetween 1981 and 2010. The study showed that about 45%o ft h ea p p r o v e dd r u g sb yt h eF D Aw e r en a t u r a lp r o d u c t so rnaturalproductsderivatives[3,4]. In the past years, the use of herbal preparations has gained attention in European and Asian countries. Only inEurope, about 100 million people make use of traditionaland complementary medicine. Furthermore, the increasingpopularityoftraditionalandalternativemedicineisobservedin Africa, Asia, Australia, and North America [5-7]. Inacademiaandindustry,agrowingnumberofresearchershaveshowninterestinthedevelopmentofdrugsbasedonChineseherbs[2].TraditionalChineseMedicine(TCM)isamedicalsystem for the prevention and treatment of diseases that focuses on the patient rather than the disease when compared to the Western medicine. The main principle by which TCMworks is the use of herbs for the restoration of the yin- yang imbalance that results in disease [2]. Despite the increasing popularity and interest on TCM, researchers facea challenging task when gathering scientific evidence and clinical validation of Chinese based herbal remedies.

Omic Approaches in TCM Research The rapidly evolving technology has led to the developmentof research tools to assist a more comprehensive studyof biological systems. In TCM, researchers have graduallyintroducedthemostrecenttechnologicaladvancestryingto overcome the most common bottlenecks in TCM research. By analyzing the emergence and evolution of the currenttechnologies,theirpotentialapplicationinTCMresearchcanbebetterunderstood. A significant breakthrough in technological advances was the completion of the Human Genome Project whichis considered one of the greatest scientific achievements ofthe past century [9]. The genomic revolution in the HumanGenome Project was the platform that contributed to thedevelopmentandimprovementoftechnologiesforidentifica-tion of drug targets, target validation, and disease etiology[10, 11]. Some of the technological advances include SangerDNA sequencing, nanotechnology, miniaturization andautomationtechnologies,DNA-basedgeneticmarkers,clon- nucleotide polymorphism. The techniques developedduring the Human Genome Project have played an essentialroleintheunderstandingofbiologicalprocesses[11]. Despite the significant contribution of genomic studies, the need to bridge the sequence information for the identi-fication of potential therapeutic targets with the physiologyand pathology of an organism using novel sophisticatedapproaches became a clear and pivotal task [10]. One wayto fill the gap between genomic information and biologicalprocesses was the use of combined strategies from several levels together with analytical technologies and improved computational power. The integration of technology, bioin-formatics, and molecular biology approaches at differentorganizational levels is comprised in systems biology andprovides a complete picture to understand the molecularmechanisms[12,13]. The postgenomic era was a pivotal stage for the emer- gence of \"omic\" studies in biological research representingthe beginning of the systems biology era. Data generated byomicstudiesaredescribedasthewholenessoflivingsystemsthat result in useful information after the application ofEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine [12]. Furthermore, new omic conceptsa n dt e c h n o l o g i e sh a v eb e e ni n t r o d u c e dc o m p r i s i n gm o r especializedareasofstudyinsystemsbiology[14](Figure2). The analytical combination of information from each omic approach is crucial for understanding the workingmechanismsofcells,tissues,organs,andorganismsaswellasthemechanismsofdisease[11,15].Visualizationandanalysisof combined multiomic data increase, in a large scale, thecomprehensive understanding of biological processes [14].Therefore,applicationofomicapproachesinTCMrepresentspowerful tools for the development of high-quality herb-deriveddrugs. 2.1.OmicApproachesatDNALevel. Genesandgeneproducts act as a complex interconnected network in synchrony with awidevarietymolecularsystempathwaysratherthanactingindependently.Sincetheestablishmentofomicsapproaches,omic technologies have been applied in different areasof biotechnology, drug discovery, and biomedical researchincluding TCM. However, a close analysis of the omicresearch published in the past ten years shows that the useof omic technologies in TCM has not been fully explored[16]. Therefore, special attention should be paid to link theadvantages of omic techniques with the complex concernsencounteredinTCMresearch. AnotheromicapproachatDNAlevelisepigenomics.Epi- geneticstudiesfocusonthereversibleheritablemodificationsingeneexpressionthatdonotinvolveanychangeintheDNA sequence [14, As an omic approach, the aim of epige-nomicsistoidentifygenealterationsthroughtheanalysisofepigeneticchangesthattakeplaceinthewholegenome[14].Despitepromisingfindings,theapplicationofepigenomicsinTCMneedsfurtherexploration[17]. Metagenomic studies involve the analysis of a collection of genes from the environment that are related to the hostphysiology [14]. This approach is of particular interest whenstudyingtherelationshipbetweenthegutmicrofloraandthepathophysiological state of the host and drug metabolism[18]. So far, the contribution of metagenomics in TCMresearch represents a novel and promising area of study thatcontributestothemodernizationofTCM. The study of the alterations in gene expression upon exposure to chemicals to identify potential genetic toxicantsand monitor their cellular mechanisms is the main focusof toxicogenomics [14, 19]. Toxicogenomics comprises the dynamicsbetweengenesandenvironmentalstressindisease etiologyanddevelopment[20]. Pharmacogenomics aims to identify and analyze genes involved in the response to drugs to assess interindividualvariability and susceptibility to adverse drug reactions [21,22]. Pharmacogenomics studies provide valuable informa-tion to determine doses for the effective and safe use ofmedications [14]. In the field of TCM research, databaseshave been constructed including active compounds foundin Chinese herbs which are categorized using chemicalinformatics protocols. Multidisciplinary integration of data4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine generated by other omic approaches provides a wider and moreunderstandingoverviewofpharmacogenomicsappliedtoTCMresearch. Herbogenomics, also referred as botanogenomics, is a novel concept that makes use of genomic and proteomiccomparative analysis for the study of the biological effect of herbs [23]. This concept has emerged as an attempt to introduce a more specialized platform particularly focusedonherbalremedies[23,24].Thecomparisonbetweentreatedand control groups gives an insight into the genome andproteome alterations that take place upon treatment withherb-derivedcompoundsorherbalpreparations. 2.2.

By using genetic associationdatabases, it is possible to make comparisons between thegene expression profile under treatment with certain herbalformulae and the profile of disease state or any knowndrug. Such comparisons can be used to predict unknownphysiological effects, unwanted interactions, or side effects[16]. Nonetheless, more transcriptomic information com-bined with multiomic technologies should be included instrategiesformodernizationofTCM. 2.3.OmicApproachesatProteinLevel. Theabove-mentioned omic approaches have contributed to the understanding ofbiological processes for the evaluation and validation ofTCM. Another promising technology developed that hasstrongly emerged as a powerful tool for the assessment ofphysiological events is proteomics. Since the introduction ofthetermproteomicsforthefirsttime20yearsago,proteomictechnologies have rapidly evolved and being integrated intoseveral stages in the pharmaceutical research and develop-ment [26]. Proteomic studies focus on the whole populationofproteinsinaspecificcelltype,tissue,bodyfluid,orawholeorganismatagiventime[14,27].TheconceptofproteomicscanbedescribedfromthepointofviewofTCMinwhichtheQiorvitalessenceistheresultoftheoverallperformanceoftheproteome[28]. Thedownstreamcomplexityofmechanismsthatleadtoa specificbiologicaleffectisnotdirectlyrelatedtothenumberof genes. Instead, other gene expression mechanisms suchas posttranslational modifications and alternative splicingplay an important role in protein variation. It has been estimatedthatabout35%ofhumangenesundergoalternative splicing which means that the traditional one gene oneprotein hypothesis should be adjusted to a one gene-manyprotein model [13, 25]. As a consequence, proteomics has aparticularlyimportantimpactonthediscoveryofnoveldrugtargets[26]. Phosphorylation is considerably the most commonly found posttranslational modification in proteins accountingfor about 17,500 phosphorylated gene products in humans[29]. Phosphorylation of proteins plays a pivotal role incrucial cell mechanisms including gene expression, cell sig-naling,metabolism,cellgrowth,andcelldifferentiation[14].Inaddition,alterationsinproteinphosphorylationhavebeendirectly involved in disease etiology and progression, but only a small number of proteins, about 350 proteins, havebeen experimentally validated [29]. Despite the enormouspotentialofphosphoproteomicstechnologies,thedifficultiesencountered in the development of sophisticated, sensitive,and reliable phosphoproteomic methods may contribute to theslowintroductionofthesetechniquesinTCMstudies. Similarly, as phosphoproteomics, glycoproteomics com- prisesthestudyofproteinswithanotherimportantposttrans-lationalmodificationincellprocesses,namely,glycosylation.Glycosylation of proteins occurs in about 25% of the humanproteins and nearly 4,500 proteins have being detectedto undergo glycosylation [29]. However, some estimationsreveal that glycosylation may occur in about 50% of allhumanproteins.Glycosylatedproteinsparticipateincellularfunctions including cell adhesion, cell immunity, proteintranslation, and protein degradation among other cellularfunctions [14]. Although glycoproteomic technologies arecurrently available and have shown great potential in drugdiscovery and drug development, the application of thesetechnologies in the development of high-quality TCM-deriveddrugsneedstobeexplored. Another omic approach that focuses on the proteome is toxicoproteomics which is used to evaluate the effect of theexposuretotoxicagentsincellsandtissuesatqualitativeandquantitative level. The proteome profiling upon xenobioticexposure allows prediction of toxic responses to herbalcomponents[30]. Chemoproteomics applies function-based proteomics to study the protein structure and their interactionwith chem- icals. The proteins subjected to chemoproteomic studies require carefully optimized conditions to conserve proteinstructure, posttranslational modifications, and even inter-actions with regulatory proteins [14, 31]. Chemoproteomicapproachescanbecategorizedasglobalandtargetedchemo-proteomicstrategies. Theglobalchemoproteomicsapproachfocuses on the cellular response, namely, protein expressionor any specific posttranslational modification, upon treat-mentwithacompoundofinterest[31].Attheendoftheana-lyticalprocess,bioinformatictoolsareappliedtocharacterizeproteinstructureandfunction[14]. Immunomics focus on the regulatory mechanisms of the immune system on pathogens from antigen recognitionto the immune response caused by the antigens presentedto the immune machinery of the host [14, 32]. Althoughthe immunomodulatory effects of several Chinese herbs arewellknownanddocumented,theuseofmoderntechnologyto assess the close interactions and molecular mechanismstriggeredbyTCMsusingimmunomicsisstillinaveryearlystage[33].

Metabolomicstud- iesincludethequalitativeandquantitativeanalysisofalargenumberofmetabolitesandtheirdynamicsinagivenbiolog-icalsystem[12,35].Theaimofmetabolomicsisthemeasure-ment of the global, dynamic, and downstream homeostaticeffect in biochemical pathways caused by specific stimuli[16].Thestimulithatinducechangesinthemetabolicprofilecan be categorized as internal factors such as genetic mod-ifications, as well as external factors such as environmentaland pharmaceutically induced effects [12]. The metabolicprofiling can also provide important information about thepathophysiological, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacoki-neticcondition[16].Anychangeinthelivingsystemintermsofphysiology,pathology,oranyotherdisturbancewillleadtochangesinthemetabolome[14]. The metabolic state of an individual is influenced by environmental, genetic, and gut microbiome factors. Com- parativestudiesofthemetabolicprofilesbeforeandafterdrug exposure provide valuable information about the treatmentoutcome and the effect of drugs on metabolism. Pharma-cometabolomics is currently applied in pharmacology, drugdiscovery, and development and personalized therapy [36].In recent years, pharmacometabolomic studies have beenwidely applied in TCM studies contributing to a betterunderstandingofthemetabolicprofile-TCMeffect. The omic discipline that combines metabolomics and toxicology in comparative analyses of endogenous metabo-lite profiles in a normal state and during and after drugtreatment is toxicometabolomics [37]. Since safety is oneof the main concerns in TCM research, metabolomicsand toxicometabolomics are very useful tools to assess thetoxicological processes [14]. in a reversible vasoconstrictivestate and kidney lesions [38-41]. A similar investigation wasalso conducted to investigate the nephrotoxic effect of long-term usage of ricin-based products. Ricin is a water-soluble glycoprotein based key toxin of Ricinus communis (also known as castor-oil plant). Long-term treatment with ricinwas shown to induce perturbations in multiple metabolicpathways including amino-acid metabolism and oxidativestress which partly explains the observed nephrotoxicity[42]. Furthermore, a GC-MS study investigated hepatotoxiceffects of triptolide (the [43]. Together, these toxicometabolomicstudiesdemonstratedthepotentialofmetabolomictechnolo-giesforunderstandingTCM-basedtoxicity. Lipids play essential roles in biological processes from energy reservoirs and structural cellular components toelements in cell-signaling pathways [44]. Studies on the lipidome, the lipid profile in biological systems, have shownthatdisturbancesinlipidmetabolitesarecloselyrelatedtothedevelopmentofdiseasessuchasobesity,Alzheimer'sdisease,diabetes, and some infectious diseases [14, 45]. However,analytical challenges have been encountered in lipidomic studies due to the chemically diverse structure of lipids in complex biological mixtures. Therefore, the technologiesused in lipidomic studies require constant improvement toprovide more sensitive and accurate analysis of the lipidprofileinbiologicalsamples. The phytochemome comprises the group of compounds present in plants such as alkaloids, polyphenols, terpenes,sulfides, thiols, plant peptides, and their metabolites. Phy-tochemomics focuses on the intracellular and extracellularstudy at different molecular levels, the chemical structure,and mechanism of action of the phytochemome [46]. Phy-tochemomic analytical approaches use the same methodsthat are used in metabolomics studies. The main differencebetweenmetabolomicsandphytochemomicsisthatthelatteronly focuses on the chemical analysis of compound present in plants. The phytochemomic concept has not been widely used. Therefore, it is more common to find in the literaturethetermmetabolomicswhenstudyingphytochemicals. Thefocusofchinmedomicsistoinvestigatethebiological action, synergistic effect, and metabolic profile of Chineseformulae. Chinmedomics has shown great potential whenstudying TCM since it introduces the holistic concept ofTCM combined with the most sophisticated analytical tools[47,48]. The technologically driven advances in chinmedomics have been used to address the efficacy and safety concernsinTCMresearch[47,49].T oensurethetherapeuticeffectofTCM treatment, the serum pharmacochemistry analysis isassessed to collect information about the mechanism ofaction,theinteractionamongthecomponentsoftheformu-lae,andtheassessmentoftherelationshipbetweensyndromeandTCM. 2.5.

By studyingthephenotype,thebiologicalprocessesthatoccurasaresultof genetic and environmental influences can be reflected inthegenomicarchitecture[55].Phenomicstudiesaredifficultto carry out regarding TCM since it is complex to identifythe compounds responsible for the therapeutic effect due tothe rich chemical content of herbal remedies. However, theintegration, analysis, and understanding of phenomic dataapplied to TCM studies represent a valuable tool in TCMresearch. The study of the phenotype at a cellular level for the understanding of molecular disease networks is the focusof cytomics. In order to gain more understanding of themolecular processes at a cellular level, the human cytomeprojectwasconceived[56].However,theapplicationofthesetechnologiesinTCMresearchisquitelimited. As discussed above, the diversity of omic approaches providesawidevarietyoftechnologicaltoolsthatareapplied to TCM research. In addition, the potential applications of some omic technologies in TCM research should be furtherexplored. In Table1, a summary of all the omic technologiesdiscussed above and their application in different areas oft h ed r u gd i s c o v e r ya n dd r u gd e v e l o p m e n tp r o c e s si nT C Mresearchispresented. Omic technologies can be applied to the study of a wide variety of diseases as shown in Table2. Therefore, thepotential use of omic technologies in TCM research has awidescopeofapplication. 3. Quality Control and Safety of TCM Using Omic Technologies A critical concern in TCM research is to ensure quality, safety,andefficacytomeetthequalitystandardrequirements [93]. In the regulatory context, the assessment of herbal medicinal products has been included in protocols andguidelinesdevelopedbyregulatoryauthoritiesandmonitor-ing agencies such as the European Medicines Agency, theEuropean Food Safety Authority, the Chinese State Foodand Drug Administration, the Herbal Medicinal ProductCommittee (European scientific committee), and the WorldHealthOrganization.Thelatesthaspublishedaseriesoftestmethodsforidentification,purity,andcontentassessmentinthe quality control Methods for Medicinal plant materials[94-97]. The European Medicines Agency has developedguidelines including the guideline on good agricultural andcollection practice for starting materials of herbal origin,guidelineonqualityofherbalmedicinalproducts/traditional herbal medicinal products, guideline on the quality of com-bination herbal medicinal products/traditional herbal prod-ucts,andtheguidelineonspecifications:testproceduresandacceptancecriteriaforherbalsubstances,herbalpreparations,and herbal medicinal products/traditional herbal medicinal products [98]. In order to meet the criteria established by local and international regulatory agencies for qualityassurance, safety, and efficacy in traditional medicine, omictechnologies have played a crucial role in facilitating thesensitiveandefficientevaluationofherbal-basedmedicines. I nT C M ,t h ed i v e r s i t ya n dn u m b e ro fc o m p o n e n t s responsibleforthebiologicalactivitymaketheanalyticalpro-cedure a challenging task. However, emerging technologiesand improved methods have [80,100, 102]. More recently, technology such as miniaturized and integrated microchips, that is, as Herbochip /_0053,D N A chip, protein chip, and DNA chip, have been developed tobe applied in high-throughput screening of active ingre-dients [93]. Therefore, DNA barcoding technologies havealso shown to facilitate the standardization, identification,and quality control of herb-based medicines [103]. 1H NMRspectroscopyisananalyticaltoolthatallowsthedetectionofproton-bearing compounds without making any distinctionb a s e do nt h ec h e m i c a lc o m p o u n dc l a s s .Th i st e c h n i q u ei sused to identify and quantify metabolites in a mixture ina one-step process which facilitates the analysis in high-throughput settings [104, 105] and is a powerful tool inthe quality control of herbal remedies. For example, 1HNMR was used to determine the metabolic profile of theChinese formula Danggui Buxue Tang traditionally used inthe treatment of menopausal symptoms. The analysis of the1HNMRspectraoftheherbalformularevealedadistinctivemetabolic profile of the decoction when compared to theindividualcomponentsoftheformulawhichprovidespivotalinformationforthestandardizationandqualitycontroloftheherbalremedy[105].UPLC-MS/MSisbeingwidelyemployedfor the analysis of samples of complex composition sinceit provides high resolution for the detection of compoundspresent in herbal mixtures without the need for pure stan- dards[106]. Themetabolitecharacterizationisnotonlyusefulforas- sessmentofefficacyandsafetybydeterminationofthecom-pounds responsible for the biological activity or side effects,but also it is essential for the standardization during can be due to factors such as the plantof the plant used, storage conditions, agricultural practices (growth conditions, geographic area, and time of harvest, amongothers),extraction,andpreparationmethods[15,35].Thosefactorscancontributetothevariabilityincontentandquantity of compounds between batches that could affect the pharmacological activity [107]. Therefore, metabolomecharacterization using the previously mentioned techniques isessentialtoensurethedevelopmentofhigh-qualityTCMs. Althoughimportanttechnologicaladvancesfortheanal- ysis of TCMs have been fully characterized which hamperstheanalyticalprocess[102,108].Anotherlimitationinqualitycontrol of herbal preparations is the lack of standards for the assessment of markers.

In conclusion, the use of omic technologies has enor- mously contributedto improvingthecost effectiveness, sen- sitivity, and reliability of analytical methods in the qualitycontrol process of TCM. Several analytical techniques arebeing introduced in quality control of herbal preparations atall stages of the production process.

Omic Technologies in the Study of Potential Therapeutic Targets The study of therapeutic targets in TCM is a complex and challenging task. It requires the use of multiple method-ologies combined to construct disease maps from differentperspectives since the effect of TCMs is the final result ofthe effect on multiple targets. From the genomic point ofview, about 30-40 thousand genes encode a larger numberof proteins that represent potential drug targets for humandiseases[14].Inthisarena,omictechnologiesprovideawidev a r i e t yo ft o o l sf o rt h es t u d yo fd i s e a s em e c h a n i s m sa n dpotentialtherapeutictargets.

However, thegeneexpressionprofilesmightnotbedirectlycorrelatedwiththelatefunctionalbiologicalstate[14].Therefore,limitationsof genomic studies in target discovery and disease mecha-nisms should be addressed by combining the informationc o l l e c t e dw i t ht h eu s eo fo t h e ro m i ca p p r o a c h e ss u c ha sproteomics. The use of proteomic and metabolomic approaches applied to TCM research has increased since 2006. On theother hand, genomics and transcriptomics have not beenwidelyusedinTCMresearchwhencomparedtoproteomicsandmetabolomicsasshowninobservationsmadeuntil2012.Therefore, there is a clear need to explore genomic andtranscriptomictechnologiesappliedtoTCMresearch[109].Proteomic studies have contributed to the identification ofpotentialdrugtargetsnotonlybycomparingtheproteomeprofiles but also by using protein-drug or protein-proteininteractioninformation[14].Invitroandinvivocomparativeproteomic studies using TCMs allow the identification ofproteinsthatarepresentinthediseasestatewhencompared to the proteome of the normal state and those proteins c a nb ec o n s i d e r e da sp o t e n t i a ld r u gt a r g e t s .A ft e rp r o t e i nidentification, the potential targets should be properly val-idated to ensure their involvement in the therapeutic effectof the compound or group of compounds studied.

Acloseanalysisofthemethodsusedinproteomicsforthe s t u d yo ft h em e c h a n i s mo fd i s e a s eh a sh i g h l i g h t e dt h ep r o sand cons of such methods. For instance, a limitation beingpointed out is the use of gel-based proteomics. Gel-basedseparation techniques can lead to partial peptide recoveryfrom the gel which requires the use of several extractionsteps to increase the peptide yield. However, the multistepmethodologies are time-consuming compared to gel-freeproteomic techniques. It has also been observed that theresolution of 1D gel systems is not good enough to analyzecomplex biological samples [111]. Furthermore, 2D gels havebeen a key in the mid-70s [61]. 2D gel technologies havepartially overcome the problems encountered in the use of1 Dg e l s ;h o w e v e r ,t h ep o o rr e s o l u t i o nw h e nh i g ha b u n d a n tproteins are present in the sample represents another issueingel-basedmethods.Inaddition,gel-basedtechnologiesare time-consumingcomparedtootherseparationmethodssuch as chromatographic techniques. In order to overcome themainproblemsobservedingel-basedseparationtechniques,gel-freeproteomicscoupledwithMShaveshowntobeamoreefficientoptioninproteomicstudies[111]. Proteomicstudiescanbecombinedwithvirtualscreening technologies to predict binding profiles of the TCM com-ponents with potential target proteins and to build protein-protein interaction maps to track the signaling pathwaysinvolved in the biological effects. Furthermore, the com-bined data from comparative proteomics, protein-drug, andprotein-protein interaction provide useful information tosupporttheprocessforcandidatedrugtargets[14].Importantadvances in MS techniques have been a key element in thes t u d yo ft h em o l e c u l a rt a r g e t so fn a t u r a lp r o d u c t s[ 1 1 2 ] .Particularly, MS techniques namely MALDI-MS and ESI-MS/MShavebeenwidelyappliedintargetdiscoverystudies.In natural product research, MS methods coupled to sepa-ration techniques such as affinity chromatography, includ-ing small molecule-immobilized chromatography, biotin-streptavidinaffinitychromatography,andphotoaffinitylabel-i n g ,h a v es h o w nt ob eap o w e r f u lc o m b i n a t i o nf o rt a r g e tidentification[112]. The study of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) in proteomicshasenormouslycontributedtotheunderstanding of molecular mechanisms in biological systems particularlyfor the identification of potential drug targets. The studyof PTMs in biological systems is a challenging task dueto the high diversity of PTMs. About 300 different typesEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 11 of PTMs have been identified using the most sophisticated analytical technologies [113]. New analytical platforms forthe study of PTMs include PTM peptides enrichment stepsafter protein extraction and digestion that are followed bymultidimensional analyses such as LC-MS/MS [113, 114].Chromatographic-based methods are also being used in PTM studies including hydrophilic interaction chromatog- raphy (HILIC), chemical derivatization methods, enzymaticlabeling study of glycopeptides [113]. Other chro-matographictechniquesusedincludethemetaloxideaffinitychromatography(MOAC)andimmobilizedmetalionaffinitychromatography (IMAC) which are the most popular the study of phosphoproteins [113, 115]. Other typesof PTMs such as ubiquitinationare studied usingantibodiesfor enrichment purposes combined with chromatographictechniquescoupledwithMS.MS/MStechnologiescombinedwith enrichment methods, such as acetyl-lysine antibodies,are used for the analysis of protein acetylation [113, 114].Finally, protein methylation can be assessed by LC-MS/MS,SILAC-MS combined with enrichment techniques such asionexchangechromatography,HILIC,andisoelectricfocus-ing [113].

A large amount of proteomic data generated can beanalyzed using open source or commercial bioinformat-ics. Nevertheless, new bioanalytical approaches need to bedeveloped to manage the enormous amount of proteomicdata to improve the handling, analysis, and visualization ofproteome information [62]. In TCM research, the use of themost recent analytical tools is growing slowly. On the otherhand,theevolutionoftheomictechnologiesandthehistoryof the implementation of omic technologies in TCM haveshown that great efforts are being made to introduce thosetechnologiesinTCMresearch. The comparison of the abnormalities in the metabolome to the normal stage provides an insight into the pathwaysaffectedatseveraldiseasestages,anditisknownascompara-tive metabolomics [116]. For instance, in vitro, in vivo, andclinical studies have been carried out using MS and NMRtechnologiesfortheassessmentofthemetabolomeintumordiagnosis and evaluation of prognosis and to investigate theeffect of the treatment [116]. Comparative omic approachesa r eu s e f u lt o o l st h a tp r o v i d ei n f o r m a t i o na b o u tt h ed i s e a s estate to identify the genes/proteins/metabolites involved indisease development compared to normal states [14]. A general overview of the application of omic technologies in differential or comparative studies indicated that coronaryheart disease, chronic liver disease, hypertension, chronickidney disease, hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis, chronicstomachdisease,anddiabetesmellitusarethemostcommondisorders studied in clinical TCM using omic technologies [109]. Furthermore, metabolomic studies have been shown to behelpfulinthedetectionofresponse-to-treatmentbiomark-erswhichcanbeusedforthedevelopmentofnewdrugs[116].Metabolic and inflammatory disorders are good examplesin which metabolome profiling can assist in the identifica-tion of potential drug targets and disease biomarkers [14,116]. The study of disease biomarkers provides informationabout diagnosis and disease development [117]. Recently, aproteomic technology that has been used in the identifi- cation of disease biomarkers is UPLC-MS E.Th i sa p p r o a c h involves the use of parallel alternating scans to generate ioninformation using low collision energy or to generate a fullscan mass fragment, precursor ion, and neutral ion infor-mation by high collision energy. The information obtained by MS Ehas been shown to provide similar data to the data obtained by conventional MS/MS analysis. However, UPLC-MSEtechnology has the advantage of allowing the characterization of unknown biomarkers in an untargeted context [118]. For example, UPLC-MSEwas used to study the metabonomic profile of chronic kidney disease induced by adenine excess and the protective effects of the TCM Poria cocos [119]. This metabonomic approach allowed the identification of disease biomarkers that can be also usedto explain the mechanism of action of Poria cocos [119]. In other studies, the protective effect of rhubarb and ergoneagainst chronic kidney disease was evaluated using UPLC-QTOF/HDMS which provided valuable information aboutthe pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease, identification ofbioactive fractions, and the mechanism of action of bothherbalmixtures[120,121].AnotheranalyticaltoolisGC-MSwhich is considered a basic analytical tool in metabolomicstudies together with NMR and LC-MS [122]. An exampleof the application of GC-MS in TCM research is a study inwhich a metabolomic profiling of depressed patients treatedwith Xiaoyaosan, a Chinese formula used for the treatmentof depression and schizophrenia, was determined [122]. The metabolic profile obtained by GC-MS in this study allowed the monitoring of changes in the metabolome present in the urine of patients receiving Xiaoyasan treatment whichprovided more information about its regulatory effect of neurotransmitter metabolism and its beneficial effects ondepression[122]. In high-throughput settings, metabolomics technologies are used not only for the identification of biomarkers butalso for understanding the progression and the metabolomevariation in the different disease stages which contributedto a better understanding of the pathology picture [116]. Inaddition, metabolomic profiling is a useful tool for the diag-nosis and study of the pathological mechanisms. Nowadays,metabolomicsapproachesarebeingexploredandintroducedinthedevelopmentofTCMs[14]. and CE-MS that can be used for the simultaneousanalysisof1000compounds.Suchtechnologieshaveshowntobefast,efficient,andsensitiveforthedetection12 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine of low abundance metabolites. In terms of bioinformatics analysis, great efforts are being made to improve the cur-rent tools in order to integrate the omic information andgeneratemorereliableandcompletebioinformaticstools.Anexample of such improved bioinformatic options is the In-tegrated Interactome System which comprises genes, pro- teins, metabolites, and drugs data [62]. Together with other bioinformatics tools such as the Human Metabolome Data-base, BioMagResBank, the Madison Consortium Database,MassBank, and the Golm Metabolome Database, metabo-lomics studies significantly contribute to picture detailedunderstanding of disease mechanisms and the identificationofdrugtargets[116]. Metabolomics profiling can assist in the identification of early biomarkers of disease which is beneficial to detectearlypathologicalstages[123].Earlydiseasebiomarkerdetec-tion is crucial for the implementation of prevention andtherapeuticschemesinclinics.Therefore,sensitivedetectionmethods to be developed and applied in TCM researchare highly demanded. Great advances in the application ofmetabolomicstechniquesaretakingplaceandtheapplicationof the most novel methods in TCM is being carried out.In addition to the omic data generated in TCM studies,pharmacologicalevaluationfortargetvalidationpurposesinin vitro and in vivo models are needed to complement theinformationobtainedbyomicstudies[14]. 5. Studying the Mechanism of Action of TCMs Using Omic Approaches Chinese formulations comprise a combination of several herbs. The active compounds in the formulations can acton specific targets and the biological activity is the resultof combined effects. The final pharmacological action ofthe active compounds can be mutual accentuation, mutualenhancement, mutual suppression, mutual antagonism, ormutual incompatibility [6]. In order to develop drugs basedon Chinese medicine, the mechanism of action and theidentification of other cellular targets should be properlyestablished to validate the pharmacological effect and deter-mine possible side effects [110]. However, the multitargetactions of a large number of ingredients present in theformularepresentadauntingresource-intensivechallengeforTCMresearch,especiallybecausemostofthecellulartargetsandthemechanismsofactionareunknown[6,16,112,124]. Thereisanoverlapinthemethodologiesforidentification of disease mechanisms, biomarkers, drug targets, and the s t u d yo ft h em e c h a n i s mo fa c t i o no fT C M s .S o m eo ft h etechnologies mentioned in the previous section are alsoused in the study of the molecular mechanisms in TCMs.Therefore,themostrecentadvancesinomictechnologiesthathavebeingappliedinTCMresearchincludingsomepracticalexamplesandtechnologiesthatneedfurtherexplorationwillbediscussed. Genomic approaches to the study of the mechanism of action of TCMs have been applied in the past years. Aclear example of the use of recent sophisticated genomictechnologies is the biclustering analysis of gene expressionprofiles using DNA microarray technology to identify geneexpressionvariation.ThedatageneratedintheDNAmicroar- rayanalysisisusedtoidentifybiologicallyrelevantclustersforgene expression profiles resulting from chemical treatmenttoconstructconnectivitymap(cMap)profiles.Consequently,thecMAPprofilesareprocessedbybiclusteringanalysisusinga factor analysis for bicluster acquisition method. The data generated by the above-mentioned tools combining gene expressiondata,statistics,andbioinformaticscontributedtotheelucidationofthemechanismofactionofTCMsandhaveshownpotentialfortheanalysisofcomplexherbalformulae[125]. A combination of technologies such as isoelectric focus- ing,SDS-PAGE,in-geldigestion,MALDI-TOF-MS,andreal-time PCR have contributed to the identification of proteinsinvolved in the mechanism of action of curcumin in invitro models. Additionally, information about the signalingpathway in which the differential proteins act can providewith information about the function and signaling pathwayinvolvedinthemechanismofaction[126].Inanotherstudy,a proteomic analysis using 2D gels, analysis toobtain the protein-protein interaction network showed theidentification of proteins and signaling pathways involvedin the effect of curcumin on gastric cancer cells [127]. Thestudies mentioned above highlight the enormous amount ofinformation and understanding of the mechanistic actionsbehind the effect of naturally derived compounds whichsupportsthepotentialofomicstudiesinTCMresearch. Another detailed study of the use of proteomics to determinethemechanismofactionofTCMswascarriedout by Lao et al., 2014. In this review, the authors summarize a number of studies based on proteomics in TCM researchcarried out in the past 10 years. In this review, it can beobserved that proteomic technologies are being applied inthe study of a wide variety of disorders in in vitro, in vivo,a n di ns i l i c os t u d i e s[ 1 2 8 ] .P r o t e o m i ct e c h n o l o g i e ss u c ha s2D gel electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF-MS combined peptidemassfingerprint,andtheuseofMascotsoftwareareusedtoelucidatethemechanismofactionoftriterpenesinleukemiacells. The study showed the successful identification of pro-teinsassociatedwiththeantitumormechanismofTCM[129].The mechanisms of action involved in the hepatoprotectiveeffects of a TCM were investigated using a combinationof 2D electrophoresis, MALDI-TOF/TOF-MS, and theconstruction of protein-protein interaction networks usingbioinformaticstools(STRING).Identificationof7targetpro-teins was possible suggesting the potential of the proteomicstrategy for the elucidation of the mechanism of action ofTCMs[130].AnotherrecentstudyhasimplementediTRAQ-basedquantitativetechnologyfortheidentificationofdiseasebiomarkers and the mechanism of action of a Chinesemedicine on a Parkinson's disease model. In this study, adetailed protein network map was constructed showing themolecularpathwaysinvolvedintheneuroprotectiveeffectsof themedicinalplantstudiedandtheidentificationofpotential diseasebiomarkers[74]. When studying the mechanism of action of TCMs, the use of transcriptomic technologies applied to TCM is pow-erful tools due to the high sensitivity, accuracy, genes represent a very convenientplatform for TCM studies. epara tion,RN Aisola tion,andamplification,hybridizationanddataanalysishavemadethistechnologyavaluabletoolinTCM.Microarraytechnolo-gies have been used elucidate the mechanism of actionofindividualcompoundsormixtureofcompoundsinTCMstudies. Taken together with databases of gene expressionprofiles of TCMs, construction of the drug-gene interactionsignature provides information on the molecular pathwaysinvolved[131]. An example of the use of transcriptomics in the study of the mechanism of action of TCMs is the study carriedout by Liu et al., 2013. In this study, differential microarrayg e n ee x p r e s s i o na n a l y s i si na ni nv i t r op l a t f o r mc o m b i n e dwith pharmacological studies for validation purposes to elucidate the mechanism of action of the TCM studied. ThedatageneratedwereanalyzedusingthesoftwareArrayTrack,CLUSTER, and TREEVIEW. The approach used improvedthe understanding of the mechanism of action and thepotential use of the TCM in cancer treatment [89]. Addi-tional examples of studies carried out on TCMs using omicapproaches to elucidate the mechanism of action are showninTable3. The use of metabolomics technologies provides a deeper insight into the metabolic changes accompanied by TCMtreatment which enables biomarker identification and eluci-dation of mode-of-action.

Although omic technologies have being applied in the study of the molecular mechanism by which TCMs exhibittheir biological effects, more exploration is needed to takefull advantage of the wide range of technologies currentlyavailable. 6. Conclusions Omic technologies have shown enormous potential in themodernization of TCM. Gradually, omic approaches havebeing introduced in every stage of the development processto generate high-quality TCMs. The complexity of TCMin terms of composition and multitarget effects has beingaddressed by omic approaches. However, further study andoptimization of the current methodologies are needed to successfullyovercomethemostcommonbottlenecksinTCM research. The high chemical and pharmacological diversityfound in TMCs requires the development of a suitable setof omic technologies established in a strategic manner andadaptedtoeveryspecificcompound,agroupofcompounds,or TCM extracts. Because each plant, formulae, extract, orgroup of compounds has different physicochemical natureandcontainsdifferentactiveandtoxiccompoundsaswellasanalytical and active biomarkers, each case requires specificanalytical approaches and methodologies that cannot beappliedtoanotherplant,formulae,extract,orgroupofcom-pounds. The wide variety of technologies available needs tobefurtherexploredandthefeasibilityofanyparticularomictechnology or the combination of multiomic approachesneeds to be studied in detail. Therefore, validation of thestrategicomicapproachesappliedisneededtosupporttheirintroduction in guidelines and to allow the development ofstandard operation procedures to facilitate reproducibility,harmonization, and standardization of the protocols used inthedevelopmentofTCMs.Emergingnovelandsophisticatedomictechnologieswillrequireacontinuousstudyandappli-cationinTCMresearch.Finally ,thefuturepictureoftheuseofomictechnologiesisapromisingtoolandarenaforfurtherimprovementinthemodernizationofTCM.
