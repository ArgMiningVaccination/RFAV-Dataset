To this end, and to better equip ABC content teams to address fast-moving audience trends, improve collaboration and speed decision-making, new content teams were consolidated in February 2018 - arranged around content and audiences rather than broadcast platforms. Content-makers with different skills were brought together to collaborate around a common area, and were structured into three content teams and a smaller, newly-created team: Entertainment & Specialist Regional & Local News, Analysis & Investigations Content Ideas Lab Maintaining the quality and integrity of ABC content is key to this change, which seeks to deepen connections with all of the ABC's Australian and overseas audiences.Entertainment & Specialist The Entertainment & Specialist (E&S) team brought together the genres of drama, comedy, Indigenous, music, children's, entertainment and factual content across television, radio and digital products and services such as iview, ABC listen and associated websites, apps and podcasts. The E&S team also includes the specialist genres of arts, science, education, society & culture, religion & ethics and ABC Audio Studios podcasts. E&S develops, produces, acquires and distributes Australian stories across ABC TV, ABC KIDS, ABC ME, ABC COMEDY, the national networks of ABC Radio, ABC online, and audio and video apps. The redesign of the team has led to the production of more innovative, distinctive and engaging content, and has improved efficiency and flexibility, enabling E&S to better meet audience expectations for multiplatform content on-demand. Within E&S, the Specialist and Distribution teams have promoted greater integration across radio, television and digital content. Further collaborative opportunities have been explored between the Music and Entertainment teams across television and radio, and ABC Audio Studios is working with all teams on returning and original podcasts. Above: Todd Sampson, Wil Anderson and Russel Howcroft in Gruen9 Genre Teams Regional & Local The formation of the Regional & Local (R&L) team enabled content-makers with a common purpose - to connect with local communities and tell the stories of real Australians and their day-to-day lives - to collaborate more closely and share ideas and skills across all platforms. Almost 800 staff from the former Regional, Radio and Television teams were brought together to form the new content team, and the grouping of skills and knowledge around content interests has resulted in more effective content collaboration and distribution of content across multiple platforms. The team is better able to respond to the changing preferences of ABC audiences, ensuring content is available wherever and whenever they want it. The R&L team's coverage of Anzac Day 2018 illustrated the benefits of the new approach, with teams working together to produce quality content for radio, television, digital and social media, covering local and national commemorations, as well as international events including the Gallipoli Dawn Service and the Villers-Bretonneux Centenary Commemoration. Similarly, ABC Grandstand and ABC Radio's Gold Coast team collaborated to produce outstanding coverage of the Commonwealth Games - one of the largest sporting-event broadcasts the ABC has undertaken since the Sydney Olympics. Local knowledge greatly enriched quality sporting coverage, with Local Radio audiences also benefiting from additional sports coverage integrated into programming. Local programming reached a national audience through Grandstand's digital channel and the ABC listen app. News, Analysis & Investigations The News, Analysis & Investigations (NA&I) team is made up of content-makers long practiced in a genre approach to content creation and distribution, with multiplatform reporting by news journalists established for many years, well ahead of other media players. Implementation of the restructure included a drive for more effective collaboration with teams across the ABC, which resulted in greater diversity of content from a wider range of sources. NA&I is continuing to work with colleagues in R&L and E&S to streamline knowledge sharing and specialist skills, and to standardise work practices and quality benchmarks. 10 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Collaborations included the seamless coverage of Anzac Day 2018 across Australia and the world; the collaboration between Audio Studios, Australian Story and News Online on 'Blood on the Tracks'; the cricket ball tampering television and digital special Caught Out ; Stargazing Live ; Royal Wedding and Federal Budget coverage; and Four Corners ' 'Mind the Gap' collaboration with RN's Health Report . At the local level, capital city newsrooms now work more closely with R&L colleagues in Local Radio, and NA&I is seeking to extend the opportunities offered by the Connecting Communities plan (see page 35). The result will be more diverse stories on local news programs, national broadcast bulletins and digital platforms. Some physical and organisational constraints have hampered collaboration in some areas. and the team's capacity to capture performance data and convert insights into improvements faces challenges in both the scale of NA&I output and access to expertise and resources. Nonetheless, in accordance with the trust audiences place in the ABC, NA&I is continuing to ensure that high-quality journalism is given the best chance to reach all Australians. The Equal Digital Life project is nearing the end of its second year, and new teams have been established to drive specialist investigative and innovative output across all distribution platforms, driven by a passion for high impact storytelling and the delivery of extraordinary, relevant content to all Australians. Above: Sabra Lane presents AM11 Content Ideas Lab Content Ideas Lab The Content Ideas Lab, a new team formed in early 2018, focuses on content innovation by identifying and incubating new and distinctive ideas specifically aimed at the 30% of Australians who don't consume ABC content on a weekly basis. It works collaboratively with other parts of the organisation. The purpose of the Content Ideas Lab is strongly aligned to ABC's strategic priorities: To create extraordinary content To deliver an outstanding audience experience To reach more Australians To build a great place to work The Content Ideas Lab team oversee four streams: The Great Ideas Grant (GIG) ABC Life Content Innovation International Strategy. Great Ideas Grant (GIG) The Great Ideas Grant (GIG) was funded from efficiencies as part of the Investing in Audiences strategy. The content fund was available to issue grants to the best ideas pitched from employees across the organisation. GIG sought big content ideas and fresh creative thinking in response to shifting audience trends. The project encouraged collaboration with colleagues, and transparency in pitching and judging new ideas. Employees were asked to choose their favourite of the 212 pitches proffered and more than 7,600 votes were recorded in response. Nine projects were incubated in 2017-18 as a result: ABC Life ABC KIDS listen: A new DAB+ radio station and accompanying app, launched in February 2018, aimed at working families with 2-5-year-old children, tested with culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) and outer suburban families who were less likely to regularly consume ABC content. Unravel True Crime : Compelling investigative true crime stories which work across podcast, video and online platforms. RetroFocus: Bringing ABC archives out of the vaults and onto Australia's screens. Hey ABC: Content experiments for Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) such as Google Home, Amazon Alexa and Apple HomePod resulting in news, sport, finance, and btn bulletins delivered by voice command. ABC Wild Oz: Continuous livestream of four native animals in locations in Brisbane over two weeks in February 2018, as a proof-of-concept of livestreamed nature reality TV. 12 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018 TV-Like: A pilot series to produce compelling scripted vertical video content for digital audiences launching in 2018-19. ABC Parents: Research into a digital content offering that informs and entertains, building on existing ABC content for parents. Shape of the Nation: A pan-ABC content approach, aimed at leading a renewed national conversation around weight, wellness and body image. ABC Life Lifestyle gaps in the ABC's digital content strategy saw 17 projects from ABC content-makers across Australia amalgamated under the umbrella of ABC Life. The project was started through GIG in 2017, with a vision to create 'your guide to a better life for you and those you love'. Topics to cover included work and career, sex and relationships, fashion and personal grooming, pets, travel and adventure, food and cooking, home and family. The newly formed team looked at the ABC's output for these topics and at what was available more broadly. Qualitative research was undertaken with Australians of different ages and stages of life and various cultural, linguistic, social and economic backgrounds. The teams visited their homes to learn about the everyday challenges they faced and how they tackled them. A paired quantitative study to learn more about people's lives was also completed in 2017-18 to feed into a distinctive commissioning framework, and a new website has been in development for launch in August 2018. Content Innovation The Content Innovation stream draws upon techniques commonly used in digital product development where agile, cross-functional teams are empowered to work autonomously to solve a problem for a specific audience. In 2018, the team worked on a six-week piece of discovery work with the International Strategy team, to refine the audience and content proposition for an International iview product. They tested concepts with Australians overseas and built a proof-of-concept video landing page to understand user behaviour and demand. The team also collaborated with other ABC content teams to build ABC's first Augmented Reality (AR) experience, the Space Discovery app, to tie-in with the Stargazing Live television event. This content experiment tested audience demand and understanding of augmented reality, and provided an opportunity for content-makers to create a narrative for an emerging mixed media format. International Strategy The International Strategy team seeks to meet ABC Charter obligations via the use of domestic content platforms and social channels to reach international and CALD audiences, and the creation and curation of content that is both inclusive and representative of the diverse communities in Australia. International Strategy has evolved from a standalone team, to a lens through which all ABC content and products can be viewed. The strategy has strong alignment to the broader purpose of the Content Ideas Lab with audiences from a CALD background in Australia being less likely to be regular consumers of ABC content, and all audiences becoming more accustomed to a borderless media world. The international program of work comprises five core project streams, with all activities designed to grow the ABC's reach with international audiences - be they Australians living and travelling abroad or in-country locals. Each of the five streams span different ABC platforms, to bridge audience gaps and reflect their preferred methods of content consumption: International iview Internationalising ABC Online ABC Australia re-brand Transforming broadcast activities Internationalising ABC content International iview The ABC's strong product offering in iview creates opportunities to build and maintain connections with overseas audiences. As clearing rights for an international audience is complex, work is being done to provide international audiences with a modest content offering - with a view to gradual expansion over time. 13 Content Ideas Lab Internationalising ABC Online In 2017-18, the ABC continued work to make its content and digital services accessible and relevant to audiences outside Australia and CALD communities living in Australia. Key activities included: removal of the geoblock on the ABC NEWS livestream across web and YouTube platforms the release of the ABC flagship app in international app stores the creation of Chinese, Indonesian, and Pacific in-language news articles and channel pages, to be featured on both the ABC NEWS website and flagship app - both international and domestic versions the creation and deployment of a Chinese subtitled iview collection. 1. The full list of territories where ABC Australia is available can be viewed here: http://www.abcaustralia.net.au/tuning .ABC Australia ABC Australia is set to replace Australia Plus on television, digital and social media channels as well as third-party platforms in July 2018. The international television channel will continue to offer Australian news, current affairs, entertainment and cultural enrichment programs, for audiences across 40 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. 1 Transforming broadcast activities In 2017-18, ABC Radio Australia continued to deliver programs like Pacific Beat in the Pacific to keep audiences informed about important issues and breaking news. After the cessation of shortwave radio transmission, the ABC installed three new FM Transmitters in Papua New Guinea in Arawa, Goroka and Mount Hagen in 2018. Additionally, the FM transmitter in Dili, Timor-Leste, was reactivated in April 2018. Activities also included the improvement of operational efficiencies via the migration of Australia Plus programming and scheduling workflows into alignment with those seen throughout the rest of the ABC. Above: Allan Clarke, Unravel 14 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Internationalising ABC content For the ABC to be truly global, and equipped to respond to a dynamic media landscape, it needs to produce content that resonates with audiences from around the world. Investing in new ways to engage with audiences outside Australia will help secure the ABC's future in this space. Activities pursued as part of this objective included: the subtitling of ABC iview content in Chinese on selected main and children's iview channels - a collection released on 16 February 2018 during Lunar New Year, subtitled to create accessibility for Australia's growing population of people of Chinese heritage, included titles such as You Can't Ask That , Australian Story , Catalyst , Four Corners , Back Roads , Student Life: Far from Home , Riot, and Mystery Road the expansion of the Chinese collection on iview to include a multitude of programs, provided by the ABC's Chinese media partners and subtitled in English the showcasing of ABC-produced content on Chinese partner channels as part of the Window on Australia content exchange (five hours of ABC programming designed to showcase Australia is broadcast on Chinese television each year, with a reciprocal arrangement seeing five hours of partner content broadcast on Australia Plus television [ABC Australia after 1 July 2018]) - due to be extended to Indonesian and Indian television networks a collaboration with ABC Life to produce content for bespoke Chinese social channels (Weibo and WeChat) the expansion of current international content distribution models into the syndication of content through partnerships with Indonesian and Chinese media organisations the sharing of Australian stories, culture and conversations with international audiences via social media; ABC international social accounts were consolidated, and language and location settings successfully used to target key audience segments 15 Content Ideas Lab the hosting of guests from the ABC's international media partners and other organisations - in May 2018, the ABC hosted successful candidates for the Douglas Gabb Australia Pacific Journalism Internship and the John Doherty Asia Pacific Journalism Internship, both DFAT-funded internship programs for which the ABC develops tailored programs to meet the specific needs of the candidates. International strategy in content areas ABC Children's consistently demonstrates the high export value distinctive local content has for overseas audiences. Across the year, ABC Children's commissioned 10 projects with international distribution and/or broadcasters, including critical funding partners such as Netflix (US), NBCUniversal (US), DHX Media (Canada), UYoung (China), and the Australian Children's Television Foundation. ABC Education's primary platforms include Learn English, for audiences in Australia and overseas. The service is integral to the ABC's international strategy as it provides overseas audiences with unique Australian English language content. Over the year, the Learn English Facebook page gained more than 300,000 likes and as at June 30 had a total of 4.97 million followers. Content highlights for Learn English included the production of Everyday English , a series of 20 lessons for English language learners, and English on the Go , a bespoke short form series for social media. The R&L team shares real stories about the diverse experiences of Australians' everyday lives, helping its audiences connect with international communities and also with CALD communities within Australia. In 2017-18, a partnership between the ABC and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) enabled regional ABC journalists to travel to overseas locations where regional Australians and in-country team members are working together on research projects. Pairs of journalists completed successful trips to The Philippines and Indonesia, where they were supported by the ACIAR team. Their reportage allowed the stories of this work to be distributed to a wide audience, with coverage across the ABC's television, radio, digital and social platforms. Further trips are planned for late 2018. In 2018, ABC NEWS lifted the geoblock on its livestream, delivering international audiences access to Australian news equal to that of domestic audiences. The ABC's Asia Pacific Newsroom underwent major changes to bring together the former APNC and multilingual (Chinese, Indonesian and Tok Pisin) services together into one team and to grow audiences for this important area of difference for ABC News. Digital output for the online World News pages improved dramatically across all measures, particularly via number of original stories and engagement time. It is expected this will be significantly enhanced by the new digital-first storytelling team. The Pacific Beat radio current affairs program was revitalised to provide more, higher quality, news-breaking stories, and The World program was enhanced to provide more original content. In collaboration with ABC International, the NA&I team contributed to the rebranding of Australia Plus to ABC Australia, to be launched on 1 July 2018 (see page 13). Above: Seini F.

ABC COMEDY is devoted to providing Australian audiences with an unrivalled comedy offering via scripted and non-scripted content on long- and short-form TV programs, podcasts, and across key social media platforms. ABC COMEDY broadcast six new television series in 2017-18 - the most aired by the ABC in a financial year to date. All enjoyed significant ratings success, particularly among audiences aged under 50. These were critically acclaimed, scored highly in the ABC's Quality & Distinctiveness surveys, and achieved official plaudits via industry and audience-driven awards. Included were the third season of the government spoof Utopia , which returned to its highest-ever ratings, and faux breakfast show Get Krack!n, featuring The Katering Show' s Kate McCartney and Kate McLennan.

Above: Corey White's Roadmap to Paradise21Factual ABC Factual programs provide a critical pathway for Australians to better understand themselves and the world around them, via local and international stories that are entertaining, thought-provoking, informative, and inspiring. The ABC's first series of War on Waste continued to have extraordinary and wide-ranging impact across Australia in 2017-18, strongly contributing to the impetus for major retailers to announce bans on single-use plastic bags and the exponential growth of Foodbank's volunteer waiting lists. The series - which won the Gold Banksia Sustainability award and the 2018 Logie Award for Most Outstanding Factual or Documentary program - showed Australians the nature and scale of wastage across the country, provided information on reducing waste in daily life, and encouraged businesses and politicians to rethink waste practices. The highly anticipated second series of War on Waste goes to air in July 2018. The ABC's community-building role was also on show during the second instalment of Stargazing Live . The series was broadcast from Siding Spring Observatory NSW, and brought together tens of thousands of people across the country for Stargazing Live events in multiple sites, breaking a stargazing Guinness World Record in the process - for more on this, see Volume I, page 38. Employable Me introduced Australians to some of the nation's most extraordinary job seekers. The series followed people with neurodiverse conditions such as autism and Tourette Syndrome as they searched for meaningful employment. This uplifting, warm and insightful series drew on experts to uncover people's hidden skills and match jobseekers to roles that would harness their strengths. The three-part factual series was commissioned by the ABC as part of its commitment to bring diverse stories into focus, including stories about people with disabilities. Engaging biographical Australian stories produced by the Factual team included General Monash and Me , which demystified the life of war hero Sir John Monash, and Hawke: The Larrikin & The Leader . Audiences were treated to Back in Time for Dinner , hosted by Annabel Crabb and featuring an Australian family's journey through the decades; the program explored the way in which the food we eat has transformed the way we live and the nature of family life. The affecting, ever-popular Anh's Brush with Fame was picked up for a third series and produced throughout the period - it will begin broadcast in July 2018 with subjects including Terri Irwin, Adam Goodes, John Williamson, Carrie Bickmore, peace campaigner Gill Hicks, and ground-breaking surgeon Munjed Al Muderis.

Original format Everyone's a Critic received international interest while highlighting the accessibility of some of Australia's most prominent art galleries, showing works of art through the eyes of everyday Australians. Above : Rebecca Gibney was a guest on Julia Zemiro's Home Delivery23Music & Creative Development The ABC's music networks continued to bring first-class artists and performances to Australians and the world. In 2018, the date of triple j's Hottest 100 was moved from Australia Day, in response to the results of an audience survey asking fans for their views on the matter. It was decided the Hottest 100 would henceforth be held on the fourth weekend of January each year, ensuring the world's largest music poll was an event that everyone could enjoy. The 2018 countdown held on 27 January was the biggest Hottest 100 on record - 2,386,133 votes were cast, and the broadcast reached 3.34 million Australians. The next generation of young Australian music- makers were unveiled through the triple j's Unearthed High competition, with Arno Faraji, a rapper/producer from Shenton College in Perth, judged the best high school musical act in the country.On ABC Classic FM, the Classic 100 Dance Countdown saw Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake voted Australia's favourite piece of classical dance music. More than half of the recordings featured in the countdown were from Australian performers, exemplifying the ABC's role in supporting local talent. The ABC's digital-only music networks, Double J and ABC Jazz, continued to expand their audience reach and engagement over 2017-18, bolstering the ABC's digital radio offering which also includes triple j Unearthed , ABC Country, ABC Grandstand and ABC KIDS listen. To celebrate International Women's Day on 8 March 2018, the ABC's Girls to the Front initiative saw the broadcast of 24 hours of songs, stories and discussions from female artists, music programmers and presenters. For the third year, triple j's Hack investigated the gender gap in the Australian music industry, examining female representation on triple j and broadening the investigation to include radio stations all around Australia. The project also expanded to include an investigation of the pay gap.

Facebook.In 2017-18, the ABC's 48 regional locations benefited from the Connecting Communities project (see page 35) which assisted in evolving ABC local radio stations into multiplatform content production hubs, producing distinctive content for local and national audiences. The team worked to the strategy of producing 'local for local' content through their daily radio programming, local news bulletins and local Facebook pages. At the same time, new equipment and updated skills saw the 'local for national' strategy delivering audio, video, social and digital content to a wider audience, with employees enabled to deliver live-and-local radio while sharing stories nationally across programs, bulletins, platforms, and genres, championing rural content in particular. Throughout 2017-18, ABC regional teams concentrated on greater collaboration, with a particular focus on daily news delivery. Regional journalists contributed stories to the 7pm News bulletins, ABC NEWS on television, Breakfast and ABC News on radio every day, and regular stories to 7.30. They delivered distinctive daily stories to radio current affairs programs AM, The World Today and PM. Delivery was facilitated by ABC regional and state editors and capital city radio managers coming together to organise a range of measures to increase collaboration: daily meetings, shared planning, joint funding, and greater staff mobility. There were a number of program changes during 2017-18. Wollongong Drive was created, hosted by former triple j presenter Lindsay 'the Doctor' McDougall, Queensland Drive programs were consolidated from four to three, and the eight Country Hour Facebook pages were consolidated into a single ABC Rural page which is expected to grow quickly from a base of 130,000 followers. 5 A dedicated regional current affairs program, Australia Wide , was introduced in 2018.

Major events included Australia Day celebrations, Australian of the Year nominations, International Women's Day, Anzac Day, and NAIDOC Week. Capital City Radio covered major sporting events including the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, AFL and NRL series, and international and domestic cricket series, and it strengthened its relationship with women's AFL (the AFLW). Extensive community engagement was achieved through audience participation in initiatives such as Stargazing Live and War on Waste , and community partnerships, for example with Foodbank and Berry Street (via the ABC Giving Tree). In 2018, the Capital City Network made significant changes to programming in a number of markets, to better align programming with dominant audience patterns and preferences in large cities. For example, the times of both the Afternoon and Drive programs were adjusted to reflect afternoon commute patterns, with a stronger emphasis on local and state news and current affairs during Drive .

ABC Radio was the driving force for sport at the ABC, with live broadcast rights to international cricket played in Australia, AFL, NRL, A-League and Super Rugby. The Ashes and Australia's tour of South Africa led the coverage during summer, and the signing of a new six-year rights deal strengthened the ABC's position with broadcast rights to international women's and men's cricket.

Above: Back Roads Photo: Larissa Romensky 35Connecting Communities In March 2017, the ABC announced a significant additional investment in rural and regional Australia through the Connecting Communities package. Connecting Communities provided an extra $15 million per annum for around 80 new jobs to support audience and content initiatives, and a one-off investment of $4 million for tools and production equipment. This investment aims to build the capability of regional teams and enhance the distinctiveness of ABC content, increasing its appeal to audiences, and ensuring the ABC reflects Australian life in all its cultural and geographic diversity. Eighty-one new positions were filled by the end of 2017-18. Sixty-one of those new roles were in local teams while 20 were in national reporting and production, with 37 regions now employing specialist video-focused news reporters where previously there were four. The rollout of new equipment was also nearing completion by the close of 2017-18, facilitating increased volume, quality and diversity of regional stories. For example, 44 sites now have live-linking capability, with dedicated fibrelinks rolled out to all offices to increase digital capacity. A comprehensive training program was developed for new employees, and a team of 'quality editors' delivering ongoing coaching and training across all platforms for regional content-makers increased the quality of regional content. The Connecting Communities package also enabled regional bureaux to move to a seven-day roster, ensuring regional stories can be covered any day of the week, and a three-person specialist weather team was created. A remote communities initiative allows journalists to spend time in rural communities rarely represented in the media, bringing their stories to local and national audiences. The investment through Connecting Communities is already generating a positive audience response, with strong digital audience growth across bureaux, and the strategy of producing 'local content for local audiences' achieving growth on social media platforms.

Nielsen TV Ratings.National News During 2017-18, the National News team's domestic and international bureaux coordinated and led the coverage of significant events and issues in Australia and throughout the world. On digital platforms, large audiences engaged with reporting of the Las Vegas shooting, the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games, and the same-sex marriage survey. Daily coverage of federal politics, business, sport and specialist reporting, combined with planning for both breaking and extended issues, delivered stories ranging from the Rohingya exodus and the US-North Korea leaders' meeting to the Winter Olympics, PNG elections and the overthrow of the Mugabe dictatorship. Domestically, coverage on long-running issues such as the housing boom and gas prices helped keep Australians informed and up to date on economic issues affecting their daily lives. In 2018, the Specialist Reporting Team was established to deliver high-impact, original stories on issues that matter to broad audiences. Impactful stories delivered across digital, television and radio included exclusives on: incidences of spinal muscular atrophy in infants, which led to a multi-million-dollar Federal Government genetic screening program; welfare concerns in the exporting of live sheep, which sparked a rethink on the sustainability of the live sheep trade; and institutional issues in the medical system that meant Indigenous Australians had inadequate access to kidney transplants, which led to a $47 million Government initiative to fund the improvement of renal care for Indigenous people. In Canberra, the ABC's Parliament House bureau delivered original reporting on concerns about the influence of China in the Australian political system, and provided comprehensive coverage of the citizenship crisis.State Coverage In April 2018, the State Coverage team launched the Local Journalism Initiative. The initiative recognised that audience habits are rapidly shifting to digital platforms, and the broadcast orientation of newsrooms was not keeping pace with this change. It prioritised the adoption of new skills, workflows, work practices and tools across the state and territory newsrooms with a focus on strong local leadership and team building. During the initiative's planning phases state newsrooms continued their work serving local audiences. There were many significant stories uncovered by local teams in 2017-18. In South Australia, coverage of the Oakden Nursing Home's parlous standard of care lead to its closure by the state government. In the Australian Capital Territory, in-depth reporting on the murder of Tara Costigan engaged audiences across the country through podcasts, digital and broadcast platforms. The Brisbane newsroom produced one of the most-read pieces of the year: the story of a blue heeler who stayed with a three-year-old lost in the bush overnight. The ABC's local newsrooms generated more than 12,000 digital articles over 2017-18. In January 2018, the State Coverage team launched a 12-minute 5pm bulletin for ABC TV audiences. Hosted by Ian Henderson, it blends national headlines with a showcase of regional content from across the nation.

In 2018, Australia's largest investigative team, ABC Investigations, was established to deliver high impact, news-breaking storytelling across 37all platforms. Further, the team's brief includes supporting the journalism of content teams across the ABC. To date, the team has been a significant contributor to 7.30 and ABC News. In particular, Australian audiences were highly engaged in the team's story of an Australian Naval Officer's involvement in a US Navy bribery and fraud conspiracy. Four Corners remains the ABC's highest-profile producer of investigative journalism. It continues to attract substantial audiences to its Monday night broadcast, which have slightly increased over previous years. Stories like 'I Am That Girl' captured audience attention across multiple platforms, and motivated the NSW Attorney General to announce a review of sexual consent laws. The team's high standard of public interest journalism was rewarded with a quality score of 97% 26 - the highest of all ABC programs. The series 'Trump/Russia' provided an unprecedented in-depth analysis of President Trump's Russian connections, and '\"Mongrel Bunch of Bastards\"' led the federal government to launch an investigation into the ATO. 26.

Discussion & Debate ABC News introduced two new programs to the broadcast schedule in 2017-18 - Matter of Fact hosted each weeknight by Stan Grant, and National Wrap presented each Sunday by Patricia Karvelas. Daily discussion program The Drum continued to provide background and discussion on the day's events and issues on both the main channel and ABC NEWS channel. Q&A built on its dominant position as Australia's premier discussion and debate forum on Australian television, providing citizens the opportunity to put questions directly to prominent decision makers and opinion leaders. Audio Current Affairs Following a review of audio current affairs workflows, reporting teams from ABC News an d RN were combined under the leadership of a s ingle Managing Editor.

Templates made high-end digital storytelling techniques available to reporters across the ABC, with the team responsible for the templates, the Interactive Digital Storytelling team, winning a Silver Medal and seven Awards of Excellence in the Society for News Design's prestigious 2017 Best of Digital Design awards. Throughout 2017-18 News Digital staff played a central role in spreading digital skills throughout the ABC, with 40 staff from different teams spending time with core digital teams. News Digital reviewed and strengthened editorial processes following publication of an analysis piece on corporate tax laws which contained inaccuracies. Stronger processes are now in place around commissioning and sign-off of analysis pieces from ABC employees. Digital Storytelling Innovation The Digital Storytelling Innovation team was established in late 2017 and brought together a blend of employees with specialist skills, with a mandate to innovate digital storytelling content and form. The team creates its own original features and works with existing content teams to improve the quality and value of digital storytelling on high-impact journalism. The team produced interactive You Decide pieces: audience members were provided with data-supported outcomes determined by their responses to questions under broader headings such as `Should you send your children to public or private school?'. In April, 'Good Taste, Bad Taste?: What your habits reveal about social class', an online survey and supporting data journalism, attracted well over a million readers, driving conversation about national culture and identity. The team also collaborated with btn to produce an analysis of 10,000 survey responses 29. Chatfuel on behalf of Facebook. 30. Apple News data. 31. Webtrends. 32.

Impact News, Analysis and Investigations assesses impact of reporting with three key indicators: Government or commercial action motivatedby the team's reporting incidence of ABC stories leading publicdiscourse and media reporting total Engagement Minutes of a digitalpublication. In 2017-18, multiple ABC reports prompted changes in government policy or initiated further investigations into matters by relevant organisations, including parliamentary inquiries. For example, in Queensland alone over the reporting period, ABC reporting resulted in the Crime and Corruption Commission launching an investigation into the Gold Coast Council, and the Queensland State Government banning developer donations to state and local MPs, mayors, councillors and all candidate. The ABC's investigation of allegations against celebrity gardener Don Burke led to widespread media attribution; as did ABC coverage of allegations against actor Craig McLachlan The latter triggered police investigations in four states and the suspension of the drama series McLachlan was starring in at the time. On digital, an innovative demonstration of North Korea's nuclear reach garnered 4.8 million engagement minutes. 31 Average engagement time across the ABC's top 250 digital publications was 346,383 minutes, down from 472,813 for the previous period when the US election dominated the media landscape. 32 Yours for news and impact40 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Yours in the community41Image: Stargazing Live Star Party in Brisbane42 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018ABC Advisory Council The ABC Advisory Council was established in 1983 under the provisions of section 11 of the ABC Act, to provide advice to the Board on matters relating to the Corporation's broadcast programs.

The Council met four times during the year: July 2017, November 2017, February 2018, and June 2018, in Sydney. It provided feedback to the ABC Board and Leadership Team on a wide range of the Corporation's programs and services. Either the ABC Chairman or the Managing Director, or both, met with the Advisory Council at each Council meeting. Team Directors also met with the Council to discuss key areas of interest including radio, television, and online programming, and audience research.In 2017, Council members undertook detailed consultations with their communities on International audiences, and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) audiences. The focus of this work was to understand: how the ABC should connect and engage with international audiences how the ABC could connect and engage with culturally and linguistically diverse audiences in Australia what similarities and dissimilarities in audience consumption patterns exist between local CALD communities and international audiences what opportunities exist to create content, services and experiences which serve international audiences as well as Australian audiences.Throughout 2017-18, the Council worked closely with the ABC's Community Engagement team. Council members played a key role in representing and facilitating discussion between the ABC and the community at a number of events including Stargazing Live, the ABC's inaugural Annual Public Meeting, the ABC Education Forum, and the ABC Community Forums in Wagga Wagga and Alice Springs. The Council explored new ways of working more closely with content areas, which led to the development of an immersive problem-based workshop model, to be incorporated into each of the Council's face-to-face meetings. The first workshop, held with ABC News in June 2018, saw Council members provide advice on the reach and impact of ABC News coverage. A particular focus was on how the ABC can connect with different audience demographics across a range of platforms and services. A recommendation to the Board from this workshop is forthcoming. Yours in the community 46 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Annual Public Meeting Initiated to increase transparency and accountability in the style of public companies at annual meetings, the ABC's inaugural Annual Public Meeting (APM) was held in Sydney on 9 February 2018. The main event linked via video feed throughout to two smaller events occurring in regional satellite locations Launceston and Rockhampton and was livestreamed. The APM provided audiences across the country with the opportunity to engage with the ABC Board and Leadership Team on their strategy to deliver value for audiences into the future. More than 400 people attended the live events in Sydney, Rockhampton and Launceston, while others watched via the livestream. The meeting featured presentations from the ABC Chairman Justin Milne, Managing Director Michelle Guthrie and Chief Financial & Strategy Officer Louise Higgins.ABC On the Road ABC On the Road is an initiative that creates and shares ABC content directly into communities around Australia via a readymade kit of assets showcasing key ABC content. The kit is also designed with internal engagement in mind, being both transportable and easily accessible by local ABC managers and employees. Included in the kit are an ABC photobooth, Play School characters, showreels, photography and audio-visual content. In 2017-18 On the Road toured both metropolitan and regional locations, including the Sydney Royal Easter Show, Sydney and Brisbane Open House events, the Collector Village Pumpkin Festival, Rockhampton's Beef Australia and other regional events. Above: Audience members at the inaugural ABC Annual Public Meeting (Ultimo, New South Wales event)47The Community in ABC Content During 2017-18, ABC Newsrooms in capital cities produced a range of 'Curious' reports based on questions submitted by, and voted upon, audiences. Subjects ranging from politics and transport to culture broadened the ABC News offering and consistently captured audience attention. The 'Curious' approach was also used effectively on election night in South Australia, providing a platform for audience questions to be answered live to air during the television broadcast. All state newsrooms mounted outside broadcasts of the 7pm News bulletin at various community events across the year. Similarly, all newsrooms enjoy close working relationships with local universities, providing regular talks to students and paid internships for future journalists. The newsrooms are also actively involved in local Women in Media events. In 2018, on the 50th anniversary of btn, state newsrooms organised a local school student to be a 'rookie reporter' and present a story on the 7pm News bulletin. The Four Corners/Health Report 'Mind the Gap' initiative relied on input from citizens willing to share their medical bills as evidence for an investigation into the extent and root cause of medical insurance gap payments. More than 700 contributions were received, enabling the program to cover diverse issues. Q&A continued to give the audience access to airtime to directly question decision makers and opinion leaders. In 2018, and on the 10th anniversary of the program's beginning, this was extended to the program hosting its first 'People's Panel'. The panel itself was made up of a diverse group of Australian citizens, selected from the many 1-minute 'audition' videos sent in from across the country. The panel answered questions from the audience about the state of Australian politics and society. Hear Me Out - a series of short films for the ABC News website, Facebook, YouTube and iview - asked what national conversations would look like conducted around the kitchen table. In the series, a gay son asked his dad why he wouldn't support same-sex marriage, and two women, one Muslim and one non-Muslim, discussed Islam in Australia. The results were raw, honest, at times awkward, and always thoughtful.Digital articles such as `Good Taste Bad Taste', `You decide Australia's population, we'll show you how it looks', and `Should you send your kids to public or private school?' encouraged Australians to explore their cultural identity through interactive surveys. The iview series 'Women's Work' paid tribute to some extraordinary women from around the country who are making a difference to the lives of others. ABC reporters explored the diversity of regional Australia while travelling from Melbourne to Brisbane via inland rail. 'Tension on the Track' questioned the nation-building potential of a multi-billion-dollar inland rail project, while exploring the challenges of regional life and rewards of small communities working together. 'The photo rich stories of Tasmania's north-west' reported on problems caused to a small fishing community by relocated seals from southern Tasmania. This year, the ABC's Regional & Local team focused on increasing digital skills to enable the wider distribution of community news, events and stories, and provide more opportunities for locals to engage with the ABC and each other on social media. Talk back continued to be an important part of local radio, providing a platform for audiences to be heard, to engage with the issues that are important to them, and to share their ideas and stories. Television programs such as Landline , Back Roads and Gardening Australia engage with a diverse range of people from communities throughout Australia every week. Community is also at the heart of the ABC's coverage of significant Australian events. In 2017, a focus on the national same-sex marriage survey saw local radio feature Heywire stories about growing up LGBTQI in rural and regional Australia, ABC Kimberley reporting on Broome's annual Mardi Gras, an ABC Alice Springs discussion with a local group who attended the 1988 Sydney Mardi Gras, and ABC Riverina reporting on Hay's inaugural Rainbow on the Plains festival. The Invisible Farmer research project seeks to reveal the hidden stories of Australian women farmers. The ABC is just one partner in this three-year, nationwide partnership between rural communities, academics, government and cultural organisations - the largest ever study Yours in the community 48 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018of Australian women on the land. ABC's regional teams piloted 'Meet Your Neighbour' which saw local stations connecting with members of their communities who come from diverse backgrounds. Teams created content that reflected the nationalities in their communities throughout the week, and, supported by the Department of Social Services, local stations held activities such as outside broadcasts, BBQs and morning teas. In total, ABC Regional bureaux celebrated over 50 cultures and nationalities, and 11 community events were held by local teams. Program teams joined communities to celebrate festivals and events throughout the year. A small sample of this year's outside broadcasts included: ABC New England from the Tamworth Country Music Festival; ABC Melbourne Evenings and ABC Central Victoria from the Bendigo Writers Festival; ABC Darwin from the Teddy Bear's Picnic at the Darwin Festival; ABC South West Victoria and Saturday Night Country from the Port Fairy Folk Festival; ABC Northern Tasmania at Blooming Tasmania in Launceston; ABC Sydney from the Granny Smith and Cherry Blossom festivals; ABC Perth from the Perth Fringe Festival; and ABC Adelaide from the Adelaide Festival. Local Radio teams also engaged local audiences in discussions about topics such as the future of work, severe weather seasons, and other political, social and environmental issues. The Community Correspondent initiative provided coverage of the Katherine Show in the Northern Territory, contributed to fire awareness and mental health days in Hobart, and in Melbourne, listeners chose a member of ABC Melbourne's audience to provide on-air reviews from the Melbourne International Film Festival. The second series of Stargazing Live inspired 46,345 Australian 'amateur astronomers' to claim the Guinness World Record title for the most people simultaneously observing the moon through a telescope for 10 minutes - eclipsing the previous mark of 7,960 people, set by the Australian National University (ANU) in 2015. The community initiative, in partnership with the ANU, brought together more than 62,000 people at almost 300 'star parties' hosted by ABC volunteers with community groups and organisations across the country. Stargazing Live was broadcast live for the first time on ABC TV and ABC ME, as well as being streamed live on ABC iview and the ABC TV YouTube channel and Facebook page. The ABC Children's and Engagement Teams hosted sold-out events around the country to celebrate and bring focus to the #GirlsChangeTheWorld campaign, for the United Nations' International Day of the Girl Child. In Sydney, local high schools were invited to the ABC for an entertaining Q&A with ABC Managing Director Michelle Guthrie and a panel of 12-year-old girls. In Melbourne, the ABC worked with the Victorian Football Federation on an outdoor public event featuring the launch of Mustangs FC, and introduced Australia's young female entrant to Junior Eurovision 2017. The ABC worked with the Adelaide International Film Festival to premiere the locally-made A Field Guide to Being a 12-Year-Old Girl , and in Brisbane, ABC audiences were invited to the ABC Brisbane studio for screenings and a meet-and-greet with some of the ABC's female hosts. The ABC Indigenous radio program Speaking Out produced a series of social media videos featuring original music and animation as well as podcast-style audio packages, in a successful collaboration with historians Professor John Maynard and Dr Victoria Haskins from the University of Newcastle. These videos explored the untold stories of convicts, runaways and shipwreck survivors who lived among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders during the colonial period. The consistent high quality of guests for regular panel discussions demonstrated the strong community support for Speaking Out as a trusted and valued source of Indigenous news and current affairs. Over the past decade, triple j's annual Unearthed High competition has discovered the next generation of young Australian music-makers at high schools across the country. In 2017, Arno Faraji, a rapper/producer from Shenton College in Perth, was judged the best high school musical act in the country. His win was revealed during a surprise visit to his school by triple j presenters Ben & Liam. ABC's Music Networks hosted the annual Classic Flow yoga and classical music event at the Parramasala Cultural Festival in Parramatta, and ABC Classic Kids: Sounds Like Australia at the Sydney Opera House. 49Image: Celebrating the International Day of the Girl (IDOTG), #girlschangetheworld events were held in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth in October 2017 Yours in the community 50 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Community Forums In response to a 2017 request from the Minister for Communications, the ABC Board hosted three community forums over the reporting period - in Wagga Wagga, Alice Springs and Sydney. The forums engaged key industry stakeholders and community members in a dialogue where participants could provide feedback to the ABC on its contributions to education, broadcast services, science, and local and regional content services. Alice Springs The Alice Springs forum brought together more than 120 members from the local community, along with the ABC Board and seniors leaders, to share their views on the role and activities of the ABC in regional Australia. Topics discussed included the future of ABC broadcast services in Central Australia, the ABC's announcement of a $15 million investment into ABC Regional and the creation of 80 new roles, the closure of shortwave services, and the ABC's commitment to science broadcasting and specialised genres.Wagga Wagga The Wagga Wagga forum was attended by more than 90 people and provided the community with an opportunity to meet with members of the ABC Board and to share their feedback with the national broadcaster. Guests spoke about a range of topics including the trustworthiness and independence of the ABC, the value of localism and the need to balance regional and national content, and the importance of emergency broadcasting and the role the ABC plays in informing communities during those events. Sydney (Education Forum) Guests at the Sydney forum were carefully selected from distinct and diverse educational groups and organisations, and included school students, pre-service teachers, practicing teachers, journalism/media students, parents and guardians, and departmental and NGO representatives. Participants voiced suggestions for improvement in educational content, and highlighted specific opportunities to develop more of what the education sector identified as key educational content. More than 180 guests were in attendance, with their views and feedback helping to shape and inform the ABC's Above: ABC Community Forum, MacDonnell Ranges, Alice Springs51Education strategy for the future. The forum was an invaluable process for the ABC, allowing it to hear directly from the education community to inform its education priorities in 2018 and beyond. Heywire - 20 Years In 2018, the ABC's Heywire program celebrated 20 years of providing a powerful platform for the stories and ideas of young regional Australians. To better understand the impact of Heywire since 1998, the ABC commissioned the Australian National University's (ANU) School of Management to evaluate the program. ANU found that 96% of Heywire alumni's lives were significantly enhanced by the program. Reported key findings were: Participants are attracted to Heywire to celebrate regional Australia and make a difference in their communities. Being heard nationally is empowering. Participants are highly satisfied with Heywire. Heywire builds the capacity of regional youth. Heywire has long-term positive impacts on participants and regional Australian communities. In its 20th year, Heywire continued to grow, with youth stories broadcast across the ABC's television and radio networks receiving more than a million views on social media. Fifty-four young people attended the Heywire Regional Youth Summit and presented their ideas for strengthening their communities at Parliament House. The Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal, which partners with Heywire, provided $152,000 in funding to support Heywire participants in turning their ideas into reality. Trailblazers, introduced in February 2017, continued to provide mentoring and support to young regional changemakers, as well as an opportunity to present their work at Parliament House and on the ABC. Trailblazer presentations at Heywire in 2018 demonstrated the innovative work already happening in regional Australia.Community Engagement The ABC's Community Engagement team build connections with local communities through community engagement events focusing on key content events such as Stargazing Live , War on Waste , and the International Day of the Girl. They also develop and manage community partnerships with schools, universities and community media, and support the ABC in meeting its Indigenous and diversity goals. Emergency Broadcasting The ABC cares deeply about its role as an emergency broadcaster, and delivers updates, emergency information and warnings to communities experiencing extreme weather and other crisis events. In 2017-18, broadcasts were provided on television, social media, via online streaming, and through the ABC Emergency website. The ABC's emergency broadcast work extends beyond times of disaster. Throughout 2017-18, managers at national, state, metropolitan and regional levels met with their local emergency representatives to plan how best to work together when disaster strikes. These stakeholder meetings were essential to building up the strong trust the sector has in the ABC and its role as an emergency broadcaster. Details of ABC emergency broadcasting work throughout 2017-18 are provided below. Winter fires swept through the New South Wales mid-north coast and around Queensland's Sunshine Coast in August 2017, and there were 32 different events in New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria from September to October - most were related to bushfires, although ABC emergency broadcasting work included providing information on an e-coli outbreak in southern Queensland and storms with flash flooding around Bundaberg. September and October 2017 were again challenging months for ABC Local Radio teams handling emergencies - with some relief provided by the additional support they received from the annual commencement of the ABC's Emergency team in late October. Yours in the community 52 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018 Bushfires and severe storms across the eastern states in November 2017 were mostly at Watch & Act level. The ABC also worked with emergency authorities in Victoria to provide coverage of thunderstorm asthma outbreaks triggered by high pollen and storm cells. In late November and early December, ABC Local Radio teams in the Riverina, Victoria and Melbourne kept audiences informed throughout an extreme rain event. The Sunshine Coast coped with its own extreme storm, with ABC teams in Brisbane, Maroochydore and Bundaberg providing coverage throughout the event. Emergency agencies request the ABC broadcasts the Standard Emergency Warning Signal (SEWS) for hazards posing an immediate threat to life and property. SEWS were requested for a fire in Melbourne late in 2017; and later for fires burning between the Victoria/South Australia border and near Lake Corangamite. Bushfires and severe storms prompted emergency broadcasting in most states during January 2018. Warnings were incorporated into cricket broadcasts and networked programs during the summer break. Further Emergency level warnings were handled in January and February of 2018 by ABC Radio Sydney (Royal National Park fire), ABC South West WA (Augusta fire), ABC Great Southern (Albany fire), ABC North and West SA (Clare/Emu Flat fire), ABC South East SA (The Gap fire), ABC Radio Perth (Gidgegannup fire and Kalamunda fire), ABC Goulburn-Murray (Whitfield fire), ABC Central West (Mt Canobolas fire) and ABC Riverina (Mulwala fire). During the same period 'very dangerous' thunderstorms were forecast for Darwin and a tropical low caused flooding in areas around the Kimberley in Western Australia. A major flood and evacuation warning was issued for Daly River in the Northern Territory, after a monsoonal trough brought significant rain. In mid-February, Tropical Cyclone Kelvin crossed the Western Australia coast between Broome and Port Hedland, with floods causing the major highway to be cut and food having to be brought into Broome by barge. ABC Local Radio kept communities informed throughout these events. Record rainfall around Townsville caused major flooding on several rivers early in March 2018, with a further low weather system dumping significant rain around Cloncurry. During this period severe storms from the Sunshine Coast to Brisbane kept the Emergency team busy, providing warnings and broadcasting the SEWS. The ABC North Queensland and ABC Far North teams provided emergency broadcasts as severe rain caused major flooding around Tully. March continued to require significant emergency broadcasting work, with two cyclones (in Western Australia and the Northern Territory), fires in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Australian Capital Territory, and severe storms in Newcastle and the Gold Coast. Two of the most challenging events of the season occurred on the weekend of 17-18 March. Fires in south-west Victoria occurred late on the Saturday evening, with emergency broadcast teams working through the night to provide updates well into Sunday afternoon. Then fires flared up quickly in Tathra, New South Wales, leading to the loss of nearly 80 properties. Coverage of the Tathra fires proved particularly challenging and resulted in the ABC reviewing its emergency broadcast procedures in order to strengthen its preparation for the 2018-19 emergency season. In late March, Cyclone Nora brought major flooding to Far North Queensland, and the effects of Cyclone Iris were experienced down the east coast of Queensland. A chemical spill at a factory in North Bendigo also prompted emergency broadcasting, and there were Watch & Act or Emergency fire warnings issued and broadcast variously in New South Wales, South Australia or Victoria throughout most of April. A major bushfire in April 2018 threatened homes at Holsworthy in Sydney, forcing the evacuation of several areas and the closure of major streets. ABC Radio Sydney went into rolling coverage, broadcasting information throughout the night and across the weekend.53 The final hazard of 2017-18 saw five Emergency level fires burning throughout the night near Albany in Western Australia. The extent of the blaze saw ABC teams return to work in the early hours of the morning in Albany, Bunbury, Perth and Sydney, to work on extended coverage. Throughout the period, ABC employees were reminded of the counselling and support services available to them. All emergency broadcast related training included details of both the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and the ABC's Peer Support program, considered a world-leader in the media sector. The ABC Emergency team also received specific training from the ABC Trauma Lead, to better prepare them for the stresses of their roles. Yours in the community 54 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018International Development ABC International Development (ABCID) is the international development branch of the ABC and sits within the Engagement team. ABCID enables partner organisations in the Asia-Pacific region to pursue quality journalism, engaging storytelling and building strong connections with their communities. The principal role of ABCID is to support media and communications, in the public interest, with a focus on development outcomes. The ABCID team utilises the Corporation's strengths in organisational management and public broadcasting to improve audience experience. It provides expertise, training, technical and program support to partners including local organisations, regional bodies, development assistance bodies and international donors. ABCID supports improved skills and abilities, content production and research through all its programs. Projects for 2017-18 included: the Cambodia Communications Assistance Project (CCAP), which supports provincial radio stations to produce robust talkback discussions inspired by ABC regional and local programs, creating a platform for citizens' voices and participation and promoting greater accountability and transparency among local authorities the Media Development Initiative (MDI), which supports Papua New Guinea (PNG) media to generate content that promotes greater citizen voice and increased accountability of decision makers to promote better governance - through training in content-making, research techniques and social media, MDI enables PNG media to meet the changing needs of audiences - the most recent phase widened the project's scope to support the PNG media sector, not just the national public broadcaster as before the Pacific Media Assistance Scheme (PACMAS) which supports the facilitation of independent and balanced discourse across Pacific government, business and civil society - with a focus on journalism education, PACMAS delivers training and development activities in partnership with media organisations, media associations, civil society groups and key regional bodies the Pacific Sports Partnerships (PSP) program which uses the enormous popularity of sport in the region to focus on women, disability inclusion and health issues - PSPs provide a vehicle for the exploration of complex development issues through human interest feature stories, and the program works closely with content teams across the ABC providing employees with opportunities to share their skills and improve their understanding of the region55 the Women in News and Sports (WINS) program - WINS utilises the ABC's expertise in sports broadcasting and gender empowerment to help women journalists join the traditionally male-dominated world of sports media - Asia-Pacific women journalists trained as part of WINS are also given opportunities to cover major regional sporting events the ABCID team's provision of technical input into communication, media-management and community-engagement activities, implemented as part of the Vanuatu Education Support Program to improve primary schooling - this included the design and implementation of formative audience research, media campaign development (to increase parents' understanding of school enrolment at the right age), campaign evaluation, and training for community engagement activities.

The program provides insights into community perceptions and beliefs about the value of the ABC's contribution to Australian society. Overall community sentiment towards the ABC in 2017-18 remained unchanged from 2016-17. A large majority of Australians (83%) believe the ABC performs a valuable role in the Australian community, with 37% rating the role the ABC plays as 'very valuable'. Respondents were asked about their views on the quality of ABC television. Consistent with previous surveys, the majority of Australians (81%) remained of the view that the ABC provides good quality television programming, and 71% felt it does a 'good job' in terms of the number of shows it provides that they personally like to watch. By contrast, 70% of respondents described the quality of commercial television as 'good'. With regard to ABC radio, 65% of Australians believed the quality of programming on ABC radio stations was 'good' while 63% of the population believed that commercial radio offered good quality programming. Respondents were asked about their usage of the ABC website and other online services. Among those who had used the ABC website, the vast majority, 88%, believed the quality of content was 'good', with 36% of ABC online users rating the quality as 'very good'. 83% of users also felt that ABC Online does a 'good job' on the amount of relevant content it provides. The ABC Corporate Tracking Program also explores public perceptions about the ABC's performance in relation to specific aspects of the Corporation's Charter. In 2017-18, the majority of Australians remained of the view that the ABC is doing 'a good job' fulfilling its various Charter obligations. 80% of respondents believed the ABC does a 'good job' of being Distinctively Australian, and 75% believed the ABC does a 'good job' of being accurate and impartial when reporting news and current affairs. The ABC continued to outperform commercial media in the provision of news and information in regional and rural Australia among both city-based (79%) and country/regional (78%) audiences. Overall, 79% of Australians believed the ABC does a 'good job' covering country and regional issues, compared with 63% for commercial media. In 2017, a new measurement - Trust in Australian media - was included in the Corporate Tracking Program. In 2017-18 it was found that 82% of Australian adults aged 18 to 75 years trust the information that the ABC provides; significantly higher than the levels of trust recorded for internet search engines (74%), commercial radio (60%), commercial television (58%), newspaper publishers (56%) and Facebook (37%). 83% of Australians value the ABC59 Quality, distinctiveness and trust Measures of community satisfaction Providing a quality service: 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 % of people who believe the ABC provides quality programming Television 81 78 78 78 78 Radio 65 63 62 61 64 Online (among ABC Online users)88 91 89 90 86 % of people who believe the ABC is accurate and impartial when reporting news and current affairs75 74 77 77 77 Providing a valuable service: 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 % of people who value the ABC and its services to the community83 83 86 84 84 Meeting the ABC's Charter obligations 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 % of people who regard the ABC to be distinctively Australian and contributing to Australia's national identity80 78 81 82 82 % of people who believe the ABC reflects the cultural diversity of the Australian community80 78 79 80 80 % of people who consider the ABC: 78 76 77 77 80 encourages and promotes Australian performing arts such as music and drama provides programs of an educational nature 82 82 82 84 83 achieves a good balance between programs of wide appeal and specialised interest77 75 80 82 80 % of people who perceive the ABC to be innovative 72 69 73 74 71 Providing an efficient service: 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 % of people who believe the ABC is efficient and well managed68 65 69 69 68 2014-2016 Source: Based on those aged 14 years and over who ever visit the website.

ABC Podsights (powered by ABC Audience Data & Insights).Combined reach The ABC's combined national audience reach across television, radio and online was estimated to be 70.2% over the period of one week in 2018, 1 an increase of 0.7 of a percentage point compared to the ABC's net reach in 2017 (69.5%). 2 This small increase reflects an increase in the ABC's digital audience (iview/ABC listen) and an extension of third-party reach delivered through platforms like Apple News and Facebook, counteracting the decline in reach for broadcast television. Radio Advance in methodology - radio From Survey 1 2017 (the fifth of eight surveys in the 2016-17 period), GfK began reporting DAB+ digital radio for digital-only stations. As such, reporting for Total ABC Radio has been adjusted accordingly to more accurately represent the breadth of ABC Radio listening over the past two reporting periods and moving forward. Total ABC Radio includes DAB+ for the last four surveys in 2016-17 (surveys 1-4, 2017) and the entire 2017-18 period (surveys 5-8 2017, surveys 1-4 2018). Total ABC Radio Average weekly reach in the five-city metropolitan markets for ABC Radio (including DAB+) was 4.79 million people aged 10+ in 2017-18, down 42,000 listeners on the 2016-17 result. Audience share was down 0.3 of a percentage point on 2016-17 to 22.7%. 3 The majority of Australians considered the quality of programming on ABC Radio was 'good'. 4DAB+ 2017-18 represents GfK's first full reporting year for DAB+ digital stations. ABC's DAB+ stations include Double J, ABC Jazz, triple j Unearthed, ABC Grandstand, ABC Country and ABC KIDS listen which replaced Extra in February 2018. Average weekly reach in the five-city metropolitan markets for ABC DAB+ stations was 684,000 in 2017-18, up 2% from 2016-17. Audience share was 5.0%, unchanged from 2016-17. Local Radio ABC local radio's five-city metropolitan average weekly reach was 1.95 million, down 7% from 2.1 million in 2016-17. Audience share was 8.7%, down slightly from 2016-17 (9.4%). 5 There were 47 million unique podcast downloads of capital cities content in 2017-18. ABC Regional podcasts recorded an additional 5.4 million unique downloads. 6 triple j ABC's national youth network triple j saw slight declines in broadcast audiences in 2017-18. Five-city metropolitan average weekly reach among people aged 10 and over was 1.82 million in 2017-18, slightly down from 2016-17 (1.91 million). Audience share was 6.0%, down marginally from 6.2% in 2016-17. 7 triple j had 16 million unique podcast downloads in 2017-18.8 RN RN's five-city 611,000 2017-18, down 6% on the 2016-17 result of 652,000.

Audience share remained steady at 1.5%. 12 There were 27 million unique downloads of ABC NEWS podcasts in 2017-18.13 News and current affairs on radio News and current affairs programs on Local Radio and RN reached on average, 1.65 million people aged 10+ each week in the five-city metropolitan market in 2017-18. This was down 8% on 2016-17. Program schedule changes introduced in early 2018 on ABC Local Radio reduced broadcast hours and may have impacted reach. 14 ABC listen The new ABC listen app launched in September 2017, replacing the existing ABC Radio app. The listen app provides access to both live ABC Radio and ABC podcasts. Since its launch, it has reached 625,000 online Australians each month (September 2017 to June 2018). 15 Podcast methodology In 2017, ABC Audience Data & Insights established a new podcast measurement, ABC Podsights. The ABC Annual Report 2017 used Podsights to measure downloads for January to June 2017, with no comparative data. In January 2018, Podsights measurement was further refined and is based on a slightly different methodology. 11. GfK. 12. GfK. 13. ABC Podsights (powered by ABC Audience Data & Insights). 14.

However, it should be noted that as a result of this change, Podsights figures from the 2017 Annual Report won't match those presented in this year's Report. Podcasts ABC recorded a total of 174 million unique podcast downloads in 2017-18, or a monthly average of 14.5 million. 16 While the majority of podcast downloads are of programs originally broadcast on radio, the ABC has seen an increase in the volume of downloads from digital-first podcasts. This increase was most noticeable from September 2017 following the launch of ABC listen app and the formation of ABC Audio Studios, the ABC's digital-first podcast production house. ABC Audio Studios recorded a total of 8 million unique podcast downloads in 2017-18 17 and produces some of the top-ranked podcast programs based on average downloads per episode. Conversations with Richard Fidler , broadcast on Local Radio and RN, consistently records the largest volume of unique podcast downloads. Top-ranked digital-first podcasts cover a variety of genres and include: true crime podcasts Trace (RN), Unravel True Crime (Content Ideas Lab), women's health, sexuality and relationship podcast Ladies We Need to Talk (ABC Audio Studios); consumer finance podcast Pineapple Project (ABC Audio Studios); news and current affairs investigative podcast Russia If You're Listening (ABC News); and How Do You Sleep At Night (ABC Audio Studios).64 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018ABC Radio: Average weekly reach (five-city metropolitan market) 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 ABC Radio: Aggregate audience share (five-city metropolitan market) 0 5 10 15 %20 23.0 23.9 23.7 24.4 24.5 24.9 25.6 26.2 27.6 25.3 26.2 26.3 25.9 26.1 23.4 22.7 23.5 24.3 23.7 21.5 21.6 22.2 23.0 24.4 22.1 22.8 24.4 22.5 23.0 ^Note: GfK began reporting DAB+ from Survey 1 2017.

Nevertheless, broadcast television remained the most popular choice for viewing, despite declines in viewing levels year on year. In 2017, 19.6 million Australians watched some broadcast television on their sets each week. 18 While broadcast viewing declined across all age groups, people aged under 35 demonstrated the biggest shift from broadcast to online viewing. Subscription video on demand (SVOD) services continued to increase in popularity in 2017-18, and in the home, internet-capable 'smart' televisions become multi-functional. Of the time Australians spend with the television set on during the day, 31% of that time is spent doing something other than broadcast viewing, 19 including watching video on demand, internet browsing, and gaming. This behaviour contributes to the progressive decline in live and playback television viewing. In 2017, each Australian home had an average of 6.6 screens, with the majority being internet capable. 20 The availability of more screens creates more opportunities to view, with portable connected devices allowing consumers to enjoy content anywhere, anytime, inside or outside the home. Television Methodology As viewing patterns change, the lifespan of content is now being extended well beyond the initial television broadcast schedule, and the way in which we measure content has also evolved. 'Long-tail' viewing measurement is now captured by 28-day time-shift TV ratings as well as Video Player Measurement (VPM), capturing on-demand viewing. OzTAM VPM Data (launched in 2016), captures minute-by-minute viewing of online video across the five free-to-air broadcasters and Foxtel's online video players. This methodology provides an 'average audience' figure for each program or episode, which can then be added to the TV broadcast figure, in order to reflect a more complete audience measure. Total ABC TV Total TV reach is slightly down in 2017-18 compared to 2016-17, with free-to-air viewing also showing a small decline in overall reach. 21 Total ABC metropolitan average weekly reach in 2017-18 was 8.6 million people, or 49.7% of the five-city metropolitan population. This is down compared to 2016-17 (8.9 million or 52.5%). 22 Total ABC metropolitan Total TV share during daytime decreased slightly in 2017-18. Across the four channels, ABC Television achieved a metropolitan daytime Total TV share of 18%, up from 17.8% in 2016-17 23. Total ABC metropolitan share during prime time was slightly down in 2017-18. Total TV share for Total ABC across the five metropolitan cities was 13.6% in 2017-18 (13.8% in 2016-17). 24 In the combined aggregated regional markets including Tasmania, Total ABC average weekly reach in 2017-18 was 3.9 million people or 54% of the regional population. This is down compared to 2016-17 (4.1 million or 57.3%). 25 In 2017-18, Total ABC regional Total TV share during the daytime decreased to 19%, down from 19.2% in 2016-17.

While ABC content-makers and program teams regularly review their own work, the ABC also commissions reviews that are independent of content-makers and carried out by a range of internal and external reviewers. The reviews involve an assessment of selected ABC content against a range of criteria, including different aspects of the ABC Editorial Policies and other yardsticks of quality. In 2017-18, four reviews were completed and published: Review of ABC interviews conducted with former US Vice President Al Gore (September 2017) Spot Audit of the ABC's coverage of the Same Sex Marriage Debate (September 2017) Review of the ABC's coverage of the Cashless Welfare Card (November 2017) Investigation into the Diversity of Broadcast News Stories in major news bulletins (March 2018) The Editorial Reviews and ABC responses to those reviews are published on the ABC's corporate website: http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/abc-editorial-standards/editorial-reviews/ Source ABC Corporate Plan 2017-18 Criterion Complaints management\u2014Timeliness of complaints management The ABC aims to respond to complaints that it has acted contrary to its code of practice within 60 days.6 ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs (A&CA) seeks to also meet the timeliness standard for complaint handling that is specified in the ABC's Complaint Handling Procedures, 7 which include but are not limited to complaints relating to the ABC Code of Practice.

RAL operating hours are 8am-5.30pm Monday to Friday, Sydney time, and the web service is available 24 hours, 7 days.Note these figures do not include the HD transition call centre operated between November and December 2017.In 2017-18, this unit received the following television and radio services enquiries, as compared with the previous year: 2017-18 2016-17 Total number of emails received 1,425 2,874 Total number of letters received 1 8 Total number of telephone enquiries received5,760 7,025 Total enquiries 7 ,186 Total number of hits to the RAL website939,519 879,485 Source ABC Corporate Plan 2017-1887Criterion Transmission performance-Total network and on-air availability Result2017-18 target 2017-18 result 2016-17 result At least 99% for all services 99.79% 99.78% Broadcast Australia data Source ABC Corporate Plan 2017-18 Criterion Operation of transmission facilities-Percentage of facilities which operate within agreed limits Result2017-18 target 2017-18 result 2016-17 result 100% 100% 98.68% Broadcast Australia data Source ABC Corporate Plan 2017-18 Analysis In 2017-18, the ABC fulfilled its functions as outlined in the ABC Charter, and in doing so, achieved its purpose. The ABC's performance is measured broadly in terms of audience trust, the nature and appeal of content across platforms (for instance, levels of Australian content, quality of content, reach and share), and the delivery of that content to audiences (for instance, transmission performance). Details of the ABC's activities and performance in relation to its content across platforms are set out in Quality, distinctive content in 2017-18 (see pages 6-39), and Audience Engagement (see pages 56-79). Network transmission performance is managed and reported by Broadcast Australia. In 2017-18, performance on an end-to-end basis was above the contracted service level targets and met the ABC's target. Details of transmission performance is set out above in ABC Distribution and Transmission Network Aggregated 2017-18 Performance . Annual Performance Statements 2017-18 88 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018ABC Distribution and Transmission Network Aggregated 2017-18 Performance (as reported by Broadcast Australia) ABC ServiceNo. of Transmitters (See Note 1)Broadcast Australia Transmission Network (See Note 2)Total Network Availability (See Note 3)Total 'On-Air' Availability (See Note 4) Target % 2017-18 % 2016-17 % 2017-18 % 2016-17 % 2017-18 Transmitters: The number of transmitters includes Analog Radio, Digital Television and Digital Radio operated by Broadcast Australia on behalf of the ABC. If a transmitter was operational during the period for one or more days, it is included in the report. Transmitter numbers for Digital Television do not include the six standby transmitters operated in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Newcastle, Perth, and Sydney, which operate as a backup to the main transmitter in those areas. The State and Territory numbers for Analog Radio excludes ABC News on radio Extension transmission services, which are reported separately. 2. Broadcast Australia Transmission Network (ABC Transmission Contractor): The transmission network performance data is reported by Broadcast Australia in the period 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2018. This is a contracted deliverable and is measured against the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for each service, network, or sub national network. The data is regularly reviewed and authenticated by ABC Transmission Network Services. 3. Total Network Availability shows the impact of all outages on the overall network: This reflects all faults across the transmission networks regardless of severity or cause or whether subject to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) or not. The vast majority of these faults are services not meeting full specification such as lower transmission power as agreed by the ABC on a case by case basis. 4. Total 'On-Air' Availability: The figures show 'off-air' occurrences where no service was provided due to faults and/or maintenance activity. It is important to note that the majority of maintenance activity is undertaken after midnight to reduce audience impact.89Footnotes 1 The Net Promoter Score is calculated based on a likelihood to recommend, based on a 0 to 10 scale. 'Promoters' are those who respond 9-10; 'Detractors' are those who respond 0-6. The NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of customers who are Detractors from the percentage of customers who are Promoters. The result is presented as a 'score' between -100 and 100. Scores over 30 in the media industry are generally considered to be good. 2 Trust, identified as a key driver of value, was introduced as a new measure in 2017: as the national public broadcaster, being a trusted source of information is essential to the ABC. 3 The target for international reach was not met in 2017-18 due to a change in ABC's international strategy which shifted the use of the bespoke Australia Plus brand and associated digital services to an integrated ABC model. Content publishing and promotion of Australia Plus services ceased over the course of the reporting period and was integrated into ABC-branded offerings. 4 The ABC assesses Quality and Distinctiveness through six surveys throughout the financial year, conducted through the ABC's YourSpace platform. These surveys measure the ABC audience's response to programming they have watched, read or listened to across ABC television and radio broadcasts, and news online. 5 Quality and Distinctiveness was introduced as a measure in the first half of 2017, so full financial year figures are not available for 2016-17. 6 Under section 150 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (the BSA), individuals can complain to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) if they have not received a response within 60 days to their complaint that the ABC has acted contrary to its Code of Practice. 7 Under the ABC's Complaint Handling Procedures, A&CA endeavours to respond to complaints within 30 days of receipt.8 Data used for this criterion in the 2016-17 ABC Annual Performance Statements included non-prime-time hours, reporting a result of 8,860 hours (using data derived from internal reporting systems). That result was adjusted later to 10,251 hours following a review that identified an error: the omission of Q4 (April-June 2017) transmission statistics for ABC NEWS, the ABC's 24-hour news channel. The results reported here for both 2016-17 and 2017-18 have been restated to cover only prime-time hours for first-run Australian television (including iview). This was the intended measure when the target of 1,000 hours was set. 9 iview Total Hours covers all content uploaded between 6pm and midnight. 10 The 2017-18 and 2016-17 results include premiere simulcast transmissions, and News and Current Affairs.11 The ABC RN result measures music played and artists featured on RN programs that contained music content. The result for the prior year was based on Australian music broadcast on special music programs. These specialist programs were decommissioned after 30 November 2016. 12 With the extension of digital radio terrestrial services to Canberra, Darwin and Hobart, the 2017-18 result is based on the criterion of 'Degree to which the eight state and territory capital cities have access to ABC digital radio transmissions'. 13 VAST transmission can reach all homes in Australia, so digital coverage is 100%. The appropriate equipment (including a satellite dish) is required to access radio and television services via VAST. 14 See above footnote 10 re: extension of digital radio terrestrial services.15 See above footnote 11 re: VAST transmission.

Providing the best creative and supportive environment for ABC teams means audiences will enjoy more of the high quality and distinctive programming they expect from the national broadcaster. In 2017-18, the ABC built on its values of Integrity, Respect, Collegiality and Innovation. The results of the ABC's 2017 Employee Engagement Survey provided the Corporation with crucial feedback from its people on their concerns and needs in relation to current and future media and working environments. In response to the survey's outcomes, and in order to create the kind of values-based culture the ABC aspires to, the ABC developed the ABC Principles. The ABC Principles speak to the way in which ABC employees should work together - across teams, as leaders, and as individuals. They set clear expectations regarding the behaviours and attitudes each employee commits to in order to deliver the Investing in Audiences strategy:The ABC Principles We are ABC Straight Talking People Focused Accountable Open and Transparent The Principles will be built into everything from the way the ABC recruits to how it manages, recognises, and rewards its people, and will be officially rolling out from July 2018. During that month, all frontline managers will be invited to attend a one-day ABC Principles Workshop. Following the workshops, monthly toolkits will be provided to managers to share with their teams to continue to embed the Principles across all work practices. The values of the ABC Principles were embedded via other means prior to the end of 2017-18, in programs and initiatives set up in direct response to the specific concerns of employees. Above: ABC Radio Perth's Saturday Breakfast presenters Jamie Burnett and Charlotte Hamlyn broadcast live from Fairbridge Festival Photo: Tony McDonough94 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Employee Engagement Survey 2017 The ABC conducted its second Corporation-wide employee engagement survey in late 2017. The previous survey was conducted in November 2015, with outcomes reported in the 2016 Annual Report. The overall employee engagement score from the 2017 survey was 46%, down six points from the 2015 results. This moved the ABC from the median to the bottom quartile when benchmarked with other Australian and New Zealand organisations. Employees expressed the need for improvement in several areas, including: that the ABC Leadership Team needs to be more visible, accessible and communicate more openly that the ABC needs to do a better job of managing poor performance that employees want to know what action is being taken to address feedback received in the survey. Areas where employees indicated strong positive engagement included: pride in working for the ABC and our reputation in the community team collaboration the quality of ABC content the value placed on diversity, inclusion and safety. The ABC took immediate steps to address the concerns of employees, providing both short- and long-term opportunities for further feedback and action. From the start of 2018, the Managing Director along with members of the Leadership Team began a series of face-to-face feedback sessions with employees in Sydney, Melbourne, Lismore, Brisbane, Perth, Kalgoorlie, Albany and Bunbury, as well as engaging with those unable to attend via video conference. Employees were asked for their thoughts on what was and wasn't working, and how the ABC could do better: the response was open and constructive, with management gaining greater insight into the passion employees have for the ABC, and their ideas about better outcomes for audiences and teams. Above: ABC Education's Bistro Escargot95 People Three key priorities were identified from these sessions: 1. The way in which the ABC recruits, contracts, inducts, develops and manages its people needs a huge amount of work. 2. More communication is needed between teams - employees want to know what other teams are doing, and want less top-down, hierarchical communication. 3. Many of the ABC's processes, tools and technology don't work effectively for its people. These insights provided further foundations for action. Work began on updating the recruitment process and drafting a new induction program, and the Jetstream project was launched, in order to improve the digital products the ABC delivers to its audiences, the management and production of our content, and the IT and infrastructure employees need for support. An investment of $10 million was made in support of more Leadership Development and technical skills training for content teams. Bureaucracy Stop was launched in March 2018 with the aim of creating a working environment with less bureaucracy and red tape. The program wrapped three months later with 147 ideas on simplification of processes, 55 of which were resolved by the end of the financial year. Where a simplification solution wasn't available in response to an idea, an explanation was provided as to why that process needed to remain. The ABC launched a new intranet in March 2018 - producing regular internal news and other communications and improving the ability of teams to find, learn about, and share stories with their colleagues. Approximately 4,000 people use the intranet every week, spending an average of four minutes on the site each time they visit, with the most popular stories attracting a readership of 1,000-1,500 employees. Extra opportunities for employees via mentoring, secondments, professional development, and support services were created. Each initiative had the core premise of open, supportive and honest talk; learning and development as key to supporting content-makers; employee knowledge of the ABC strategy and their role in it; and ABC values as evident in the way all employees interact.93 Leadership Training events 900 participants Change it Up was launched in April 2018, and was designed to afford employees the opportunity to experience and understand different parts of the ABC outside of their everyday role, facilitating inter-ABC collaboration, and building and strengthening collegiate relationships. Through one of three channels - Mentoring, Skills, Community Engagement - employees could also volunteer for key ABC activities in their local community, broadening their own experience while providing valuable assistance in the running of local engagement initiatives. Sixty mentees were matched to mentors after just a few months, and ABC employees found greater involvement with each other and the community through unique ABC experiences such as Stargazing Live . Speak Up was also launched in early 2018 and provided an opportunity for employees to talk to their peers about gender, sexism, racism, and other cultural safety issues and receive support. Speak Up supporters are trained in the legal framework and ABC policies on discrimination, bullying and harassment; responding to disclosures; dealing with trauma; and providing guidance. Programs to address employee concerns and provide opportunities for engagement were still being established and rolled out at the end of 2017-18, with the ABC continuing to monitor and progress actions, and employees contributing through their open feedback and ongoing involvement.96 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Capability, development and training In 2017-18, the ABC created and provided learning and development activities to build and enhance the capabilities of ABC employees, using the Investing in Audiences strategy as its focus. A key area for learning and development in 2017-18 was supporting the content team reorganisation (see page 8). Training needs analyses were undertaken to ensure employees were supported in building their content making, digital, and social media skills across all platforms, and a range of learning activities focusing on supporting leaders, building high-performance teams and enhancing cross-team collaboration was developed and delivered to content-team leaders and employees. During 2017-18, training in more than 210 different topics across 71 skill areas was delivered using a range of learning platforms and methodologies. Learning opportunities were offered using a blended approach including short, focused sessions; longer intensive sessions; masterclasses; and online learning via video and infographic resources and webinars, which provided more options for regional employees. Learning activities were delivered by the Learning Team members and subject matter experts from across the ABC, supported by trainers. During the year, 35 more subject matter experts attended 'train the trainer' sessions to build their skills in providing training to their colleagues. Broadly, learning activity topics covered: content-making, digital and social media skills including digital-first story production and the use of data-analytics platforms technical skills including using different software platforms and training on the use of drones in reporting work health and safety training including induction, first aid, employee wellbeing, and mental health and trauma awareness corporate programs including ABC Principles, and cultural and unconscious-bias awareness raising leadership development focusing on key strategic needs and leadership capabilities on-the-job training including cadetships, peer-to-peer training, action learning groups and coaching. During 2017-18 close to 11,300 employee attendances were recorded at 1,588 learning events delivered internally, externally, online and via webinar, amounting to 50,896 participant hours. 'Just-in-time' flexible online learning continued to help facilitate these opportunities by increasing employee training accessibility regardless of location or role. They are designed to work seamlessly on any digital device, and 25 new video-based resources were added to the online suite in 2017-18. 97 People Training hours by gender and job classification 2017-18 Job Female Male Total Content Maker 19,556 133 211 Retail 3 27 30 Committee/Board 2 0 2 Not trackable 340 200 540 Grand Total* 26,491 24,405 50,896 * All figures rounded to the nearest whole hour Leadership training There was a significant focus on leadership development during the year, to support leaders to embed the changes which occurred in both content and support teams.

Employment Agreements The ABC Enterprise Agreement 2016-2019 came into operation in December 2016, and will reach its nominal expiry date in June 2019. In March 2017, the ABC Senior Employment Agreement 2016 reached its nominal expiry date. The ABC Senior Employment Agreement will continue to operate until a new agreement is made or the current agreement is terminated.98 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Diversity The ABC is committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace, demonstrating values-based leadership, and to fostering attitudes and behaviours that contribute to a safe, creative, and vibrant working environment for all its employees. In 2017-18 the ABC aimed to achieve targets against the ABC Equity and Diversity Plan 2016-18 and the ABC Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan 2016-18, and built on its commitment by launching a new diversity and inclusion framework. Equity and Diversity Plan The ABC is required by the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act 1987 (the EEO Act) to develop a program designed to eliminate discrimination and promote equal opportunity for women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people from a non-English speaking background, and people with disabilities. The ABC Equity and Diversity Plan 2016-18 sets out clear approaches and targets to achieve the objectives of: encouraging a culture of diversity, engagement and flexibility embracing diversity in the workplace representing, engaging and connecting with various communities. The following employment targets were identified to guide the approach of ABC teams: 50% women senior executives; 20% women technologists; 15% non-English speaking background senior executives; and up to 12% non-English speaking background content-makers. At the end of June 2018, the ABC had met one of the four employment targets - 50% women senior executives. Based on the data and progression rate, it is unlikely the other three targets will be met by the end of the current Plan. More information on outcomes and next steps against the Plan will become available when the ABC Equity and Diversity Annual Report 2017-18 is tabled.Equity and Diversity Annual Report Section 9(2) of the EEO Act requires that the ABC report its performance annually for the period 1 September to 31 August. The ABC's Equity and Diversity Annual Report is submitted to the Minister for Communications and tabled in Parliament. Detailed information about, and analysis of, the ABC's equity and diversity programs and initiatives will be found in that Report. Current and historical reports are available at http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/reports-and-publications/ . Workforce diversity Media cadetships In 2017-18, the ABC launched its new Media Cadetship program, providing applicants with an opportunity to work across the ABC in content areas for one year. The objective was to unearth and develop new talent, with new approaches to content-making or digital specialist skills, allowing the ABC to connect with underrepresented audience groups and add energy, ideas and innovation to the workforce of the future. The Cadetship callout attracted more than 1,200 applications from across Australia. Of the 13 successful applicants, seven were culturally and linguistically diverse, two were Indigenous, one identified as LGBTQI+, one was a school leaver, and four were women applying for cadetships in traditionally male roles. In the first week of the program, cadets attended an ABC Training Bootcamp which included a thorough induction to the ABC: sessions on Editorial Policies; Legal; cultural awareness; an ABC tour; and an opportunity to represent the ABC at the Guinness World Record Stargazing Live event. During the year, a new partnership between the ABC and the Victorian Multicultural Commission saw the ABC providing three paid 12-week internships in the Melbourne newsroom. The ABC is proud of this partnership and hopes to continue to support and strengthen its relationship with the Victorian Multiculturalism Commission while increasing the diversity of its workforce.99 People Indigenous employment The ABC's Stretch Reconciliation Action Plan 2016-18 is a Stretch RAP under Reconciliation Australia's RISE (Reflect, Innovate, Stretch, Elevate) framework, and commits the ABC to meeting targets that build on its successes in its first (2009-12) and second (2013-15) RAPs. It focuses on the following four key areas: Relationships Respect Opportunities\u2014Employment and Supplier Diversity Opportunities\u2014Content All actions outlined in the Plan are monitored for progress by the ABC's Bonner Committee. Named for the late Neville Bonner AO, who was an ABC Board Director from 1983 to 1991 and Australia's first Indigenous Senator, the Bonner Committee is the ABC's primary advisory and representative body on matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees, content, and communities. Comprising a mix of Indigenous and non- Indigenous employees, the Committee of 14 members meets at least six times a year, and the Chair provides feedback and advice on discussions and decisions directly to the Managing Director. Reports on progress against RAP targets are also reported to the Leadership Team biannually, with external reports on progress published annually via extensive coverage in the ABC's Equity and Diversity Annual Report. RAP impact measurement information is provided in response to Reconciliation Australia's Impact questionnaire. The ABC's Stretch RAP includes an Indigenous employment target of 3% by the end of 2018, a target the Corporation is on track to reach.

The ABC's Indigenous Employment intranet page was refreshed in early 2018 when the new intranet portal was launched, providing information and resources about Indigenous cultural protocols 100 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018and support for Indigenous employees, and updates on Indigenous programs, initiatives and events at the ABC. Further, the refresh of the external-facing ABC Careers page featured 'Your Future - Indigenous Careers' as a click point to guide prospective employees to tailored information about Indigenous employment opportunities. Gender Profile The ABC is committed to gender equality in the workplace, tracking key equality indicators such as gender composition of the workforce, and the equality of remuneration between women and men.Gender composition: management (as at 30 June 2018) Female Male Total Board Member 6 3 9 Executive Director 5 5 10 Senior Executive 143 146 289 Notes: 1.

Senior Executive includes the Managing Director and Team Directors In 2017-18, two ABC employees participated in the Springboard career and professional development program, which provides women in non-managerial roles the opportunity to enhance their skills and abilities and challenge power while building confidence and assertiveness. On International Women's Day (IWD), morning teas and activities were held at ABC offices around the country to celebrate women working in the media industry. This year IWD's theme was #pressforprogress - a uniting call to progress gender parity and to think, act and be gender inclusive. Margaret Throsby, a trailblazer for women working in media, was the special guest at the Ultimo morning tea. In 1975 Margaret became the first woman (since the Second World War) to read national radio news, and in 1978, the first woman to read the news on ABC television.IWD was promoted across ABC platforms and content with specialist programming and guest presenters, highlighting the contribution of female broadcasters, program-makers and support staff throughout the Corporation. ABC radio, TV and News programs were presented by all women line-ups, and the ABC announced a new cadetship scheme supported by Screen Australia that encourages women to enter the film and television industry. Diversity & Inclusion Standing Committee (DISC) In May 2018, the ABC launched a new governance framework to guide and track the ABC's approach to diversity and inclusion. This approach was endorsed by the Leadership Team and aimed to introduce a truly pan-ABC, structured system focused on top-down accountability in diversity and inclusion. 101 People A leading component of the new framework is the Diversity & Inclusion Standing Committee (DISC). Co-chaired by the Director of Regional & Local and the Director of Audiences, the DISC includes Team Diversity Leads - being senior representatives from each ABC Team who drive and encourage diversity outcomes within their team - a representative from the Bonner Committee, and a representative from each Employee Diversity Group (EDG). EDGs provide employees who share similar backgrounds, needs or interests with a platform for networking, ideas sharing, and collaboration. The DISC meets quarterly to review progress against equity and diversity priorities, and to oversee the development of the ABC's new Equity and Diversity Plan for 2019-21. The Diversity Unit facilitates these meetings. 1. The organisation is dedicated to working with employers and employees to improve the health and wellbeing of LGBTIQ people by reducing exclusion, invisibility, homophobia and stigma in the workplace. Their services include a relationship manager, assistance with inclusion in policies and guidelines, support in the workplace and the provision of forums for networking and awareness training around Australia. ABC Pride The ABC Pride group is an EDG that includes employees who identify as LGBTIQ along with supporters. The ABC is a member of Pride in Diversity (PID), Australia's first and only not-for-profit employer support program for LGBTIQ workplace inclusion. 1 ABC Pride exists to promote and encourage LGBTIQ inclusion across all aspects of the ABC's business. The group meets monthly to develop and implement initiatives to support the positive representation and profile of LGBTIQ people in ABC content, services and the ABC workforce, and to promote the engagement of LGBTIQ employees. The group also organises regular social and networking events, open to LGBTIQ employees and allies.

Health and safety committees A total of 15 WHS Committees operate across the ABC, with a total of 142 health and safety representatives involved. Due to their size, the Editorial Policies and Government Relations teams do not have WHS Committees, using 'other agreed arrangements' to undertake WHS consultation with their employees (who altogether comprise 0.45% of the ABC workforce). WHS consultative arrangements (WHS Committees and other agreed arrangements) cover 100% of the ABC's people. Notices and investigations Comcare has the power to conduct an investigation at an ABC workplace at any time to ascertain whether the requirements of WHS legislation are being complied with, regarding a breach or suspected breach, or concerning an accident or dangerous occurrence that occurred. During 2017-18, there were no investigations conducted by Comcare as a result of any Comcare-notified incidents. There were no Prohibition Notices or Improvement Notices served on the ABC during 2017-18, and as at 30 June 2018 there were no outstanding actions arising from, or relating to, previous years' notices.Work-related incidents In 2017-18, a total of 252 work-related incidents were reported (compared with 235 in 2016-17). Of those incidents, 11 were notified to Comcare by the ABC. An incident is notifiable to Comcare if it results in death, medical treatment as an inpatient in a hospital, immediate treatment for a serious injury, infection with a prescribed illness, or if it involves a dangerous occurrence. The ABC must ensure that notification is made to Comcare, and the ABC Board, immediately after becoming aware that a notifiable incident has occurred. Workers' compensation claims Of the 252 work-related incidents reported in 2017-18, eight resulted in workers' compensation claims being accepted by Comcare (compared with 15 in 2016-17). Analysis of the accepted claims shows injuries were spread evenly between being hit by objects, motor vehicle accidents and body stressing, which includes all musculoskeletal disorders such as occupational overuse and manual task injuries. The 2017-18 results show close to a 50% reduction in total claims numbers compared with the 2016-17 data. Workers' compensation premiums The ABC Premium rate decreased from 0.76% in 2017-18 to 0.66% in the 2018-19 review. The reduction reflects the claims performance of the Comcare scheme as a whole since June 2017 and is a response to 20% better than expected developments in lifetime cost estimates for ABC claims by employees who sustained injuries in 2013-14 and 2015-16 and 2016-17. The overall premium rate for all Commonwealth agencies decreased from 1.23% in 2017-18 to 1.06% in 2018-19 in response to fewer overall claims being accepted by the Comcare scheme. 103 Work Health and Safety Work-related incidents: severity of incident2 Severity of Incident* 1 July 2017 - 30 June 2018 1 July 2016 - 30 June 2017 Work Related Incidents% of totalWork Related Incidents% of total Near hit incident / no treatment required64 25% 81 35% First aid treatment only 32 13% 66 28% Lost time injury/illness - off work for one full day/shift or more15 6% 17 7% Medical treatment (from a medical doctor) - off work for less than 1 full day/shift48 19% 5 2% Precautionary treatment (from an allied health practitioner e.g. Physio)24 10% 63 27% Report Only - No treatment** 69 Dangerous occurrence+ 3 1% Fatality 235 100% *Definitions of 'severity of incident' have been modified to align with industry and regulatory definitions. **New measure related to modification described above.

Previous definitions of 'severity of incident' were not consistent with industry and regulatory definitions. In 2017-18 the metrics were modified to align with accepted industry and regulatory definitions and metrics. 2016-17 performance in this area was evaluated to confirm consistency within current definitions. 104 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Editorial Quality ABC Editorial Policies The ABC Editorial Policies and associated guidance outline the principles and set the standards that govern ABC content and are a day-to-day reference for content-makers. They are critical to the ABC's ability to meet its statutory obligations and the expectations of audiences. They also form the basis of the ABC Code of Practice, which the ABC provides to the industry regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). In addition, they give practical shape to statutory obligations in the ABC Act, in particular the obligations to provide services of a high standard; maintain independence and integrity; and to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Editorial management and guidance In 2017-18, the Editorial Policies Team revised and expanded its structure to reflect the reorganisation of the ABC into new content teams (see page 8). As well as the Editorial Director, who oversees editorial standards across the ABC, there are now dedicated editorial advisers embedded in the three key content areas - News, Analysis & Investigations, Regional & Local, and Entertainment & Specialist - as well as a fourth adviser working with the new Content Ideas Lab and providing advice to the Commercial and Audiences Teams. This new structure ensures that effective and timely advice, training and editorial reviews are delivered across all the ABC's output. There were no changes made to the Editorial Policies or the Code of Practice in 2017-18. However, the Editorial Policy Group - chaired by the Editorial Director and consisting of editorial policy specialists and other senior employees from content-making teams, ABC Legal, and ABC Audience & Consumer Affairs - issued a range of new or revised guidance notes to assist journalists and content makers in upholding the editorial standards: New guidance on Interviewing (August 2017) Revised guidance on Complaints Handling (September 2017) New guidance on Accessibility (November 2017) Existing guidance notes on external funding and advertising for the Australia Plus international service were also temporarily withdrawn in June 2018 pending a restructure and rebranding of the service. Following a review of editorial processes instigated after errors were made in the production of a digital news story and analysis piece on company tax policy in February 2018, these changes were introduced: A specialist digital editor was recruited to the business reporting team to strengthen production oversight of online business stories. The digital network editor position based in the Brisbane online newsroom was upgraded to a managing editor role, with clearer editorial oversight duties. News, Analysis & Investigations leadership responsibilities were reassigned to carve out a dedicated executive editor position, as the final upward referral point for news output across all platforms. This role is also responsible for oversight of analysis pieces on the website and editorial standards. Editorial training The period saw a strong emphasis on increasing awareness of the editorial requirement to provide individuals and organisations about whom allegations have been made, a fair to opportunity to respond to those allegations. This is a crucial requirement that is fundamental to all good journalistic practice, as expressed in section 5.3 of the Editorial Policies. This emphasis will continue through 2018--19.105 Editorial Quality During the first half of 2017-18 there was also a concerted effort to increase awareness of, and compliance with, the requirements of the ABC's personal use of social media policy. This was coupled with ongoing reinforcement of the need for impartiality when discussing or reporting contentious public policy debates. ABC News, with ABC Editorial Policies, conducted training and seminars in all state and territory capitals throughout 2017-18. The sessions consisted of both general refreshers and short specialised seminars on specific areas of the Editorial Policies. Specialised sessions covered source protection, the personal use of social media, and training on covering elections, which was offered in the lead-up to state elections in Queensland and South Australia. As part of a targeted mobility program, ABC News Online in Brisbane hosted 40 journalists to receive first-hand experience in the gathering, production and distribution of news to audiences using digital devices. The table below shows the number of participants who attended specific Editorial Policies training in 2017-18: ProgramTotal eventsTotal participantsTotal partici-pant training hours Editorial Policies57 515 622 In addition to these face-to-face training sessions, 444 employees accessed the online Editorial Policies training resource. This is a good example of a ' just-in-time' learning resource (see page 96), accessible anywhere, anytime; allowing editorial decisions to be made more quickly and accurately. Editorial reviews The ABC consistently reviews its own performance against the Editorial Standards. Content-makers and program teams regularly review their own work, and the ABC also commissions reviews that are independent of content-makers and carried out by a range of internal and external reviewers. An overview of Editorial Reviews in 2017-18 can be found in the Annual Performance Statements from page 84. The Editorial Reviews and ABC responses to those reviews are published on the ABC's corporate website: http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/abc-editorial-standards/editorial-reviews/ . Corrections and clarifications The ABC publishes a Corrections and Clarifications page on its corporate website which brings together in one place the corrections and clarifications made to ABC content across radio, television and digital platforms, whether as a result of complaints or for any other reason. Where possible, links to the original content are provided. In 2017-18, 59 corrections or clarifications were published on the Corrections and Clarifications page on the ABC's website. Where online transcripts existed, Editor's Notes and corrections to copy were also published. Election coverage review The Election Coverage Review Committee (ECRC) is convened during each federal, state or territory election campaign to monitor ABC coverage and ensure ABC editorial standards are met. The Committee is usually chaired by the Editorial Director and comprises representatives from all relevant ABC teams. It is principally a committee of review and does not supplant the usual lines of editorial authority in each team during an election campaign. For federal elections, the ECRC reviews externally commissioned share of voice data to ensure appropriate editorial balance is maintained and no single political party is disproportionately represented. This is done while recognising that there are a range of factors which can and will affect the amount of time or share of voice of each party. For state and territory elections, the ECRC monitors content, internal records and feedback to ensure editorial balance. Audience complaints about election coverage are also reviewed by the Committee. The Chair of the ECRC is also responsible for administering the free broadcast time allocated to eligible political parties. Broadcast slots are provided on television and radio for policy announcements by political parties who meet the eligibility criteria. During 2017-18 the ECRC convened on three occasions, to cover the state elections in Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania.106 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Infrastructure and Operations Technology In 2017-18, ABC Technology delivered several major projects that improved and streamlined the Corporation's capabilities. Included were automation of processes in the creative cycle; automation of workflows for more efficient administrative activities; and the introduction of self-service capabilities for incident management. A substantial investment program is currently being developed to transform the Corporation's technical landscape and enhance content creation capabilities. Desktop and laptop devices are now purchased via the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) agreement, resulting in a financial benefit to the ABC. The rollout and upgrade of network connectivity from the aging copper infrastructure to dedicated fibre into all the Corporation's regional offices greatly improved productivity and opened up new opportunities for additional content creation and sharing on a national basis. Jetstream Jetstream is a long-term program of investment set to transform the ABC's digital audience facing products, its content management and production, and its supporting technology infrastructure. It will provide the critical technology improvements required to deliver on the ABC's strategic content objectives and Charter requirements. The delivery approach is focused on modular solutions and an evolution of digital products rather than high-cost multi-year individual projects, to afford flexibility in investment phasing and profile. With implementation occurring in stages, the program aims to: reduce the risk of failed return on investments improve the prioritisation and sequencing of projects stop the delivery of siloed products or solutions leverage modern technology principles across decision making. The initial Jetstream investment was made up of projects that: provided the delivery of specific audience benefits across digital products; established building blocks to enable transformation in content management and production technology; addressed urgent minor capital requirements that impacted on content production or broadcast; and progressed the ABC's migration to the cloud. Information and cyber security management Managing risk in technology information systems, infrastructure, and security, is central to the core business of the ABC. The Corporation's cybersecurity program continues to evolve, with priority given to program and service delivery on online and mobile platforms. In 2017-18, ABC information and cybersecurity underwent a major transformation, with a new team established that continues to maintain operational readiness. A substantial investment program will ensure the Corporation maintains an appropriate state of capability and can adjust to ever-changing cybersecurity threats. Throughout 2017-18, a concerted effort to increase the usage of cloud-based hosting services saw dedicated teams established to build secure connectivity between the ABC and the cloud hosting provider. This connectivity facilitated the migration of several applications from on-premises to the cloud. Additional applications, workflows and other services are being identified and considered for cloud enablement and migration.107 Infrastructure and Operations Business continuity and disaster recovery The ABC's business continuity program manages the development, testing and ongoing maintenance of the Corporation's business resilience, crisis management and disaster recovery programs. The program continues to focus on effectively managing foreseeable business disruptions through a reliable and mature risk management practice and continuing to build capacity in organisational resilience to better prepare and respond to unforeseen business disruptions with a key aim to develop confident, competent employees and agile management teams. Business continuity and disaster recovery services were maintained and tested throughout 2017-18. Several disaster recovery tests were undertaken covering various systems and programs, with the learnings from test each fed back into the next for continuous improvement in the process. Transmission and distribution of ABC services During 2017-18, the Communications Networks team oversaw the transition to new satellite distribution technology to reduce the ABC satellite capacity in use. This transition involved both a reconfiguration of the satellite uplink as well as the installation of new receiving technology at 257 transmission downlink sites across the country. Broadcast Australia installed a replacement transmit antenna at the Mt Wellington site for the ABC's Hobart services, significantly improving coverage of the ABC's digital television signal and introducing the capacity to transmit digital radio services. The project enabled the decommissioning of the temporary UHF television service that had been providing coverage to residents in the North Eastern suburbs of Hobart. The ABC conducted field measurements to assess the performance of the new transmit antenna, and conducted audience information sessions to assist residents with the changes. Over the period, the ABC's satellite television contribution network was upgraded to enable Above: Capturing footage for the ABC's Kokoda VR project108 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018the carriage of high definition content, and the installation of the Digital Electronic Newsgathering (DENG) network, used extensively by News for the collection of content in metropolitan areas, was completed. ABC RN and ABC News on radio coverage in Karratha was improved as the result of a transmit antenna upgrade undertaken by Broadcast Australia in June 2018, and during 2017-18 two new digital radio services were launched in Canberra, two in Hobart, and one in Darwin. The ABC digital radio footprint now reaches 60.9% of the Australian population. Five new FM relay services were established in Papua New Guinea for the provision of Radio Australia. These new services will improve coverage for Radio Australia listeners in Port Moresby and Lae, and introduce new services to the Arawa, Goroka and Mt Hagan communities. Over the year, the Communications Networks team worked closely with Broadcast Australia to change the way transmission service performance tests are conducted. Traditionally testing occurred annually on each service, and required the service to be switched off overnight. The new testing methodology introduced in February 2018 sees testing undertaken while television transmission services remain on. Over the six months of the new testing regime (January - June 2018), television services were off for testing for 213 hours, compared with 409 hours in the same period the previous year - a reduction of 48%. Transmission performance Transmission and distribution performance was within contracted service level agreements for all radio and television networks in 2017-18. Overall transmission performance in regional areas was impacted by the continued NBN and 4G rollout, with tower works for these telecommunications services causing some disruption to radio and television operation. Overall availability of transmission services was also affected by time taken to repair technical service faults that were identified as a result of annual performance testing undertaken in accordance with contractual obligations. These technical service faults often require specialist staff or equipment replacement to restore services to normal operation. Broadcast Australia has continued its television transmitter replacement program, upgrading 14 television transmitters across the country during 2017-18. Capital works Renewing Adelaide The Renewing Adelaide project ($8 million) saw an ABC team previously scattered throughout six of the seven floors of Adelaide's Collinswood facility brought together on three, refurbished lower floors. The project aligns with the ABC's commitment to making the ABC a better place to work, recognising the impact that both floor design and proximity of colleagues has on Proportion of the population able to receive transmissions from ABC broadcasting services (as at 30 June 2018) AustNSW/ ACTVic Qld WA SA Note : Population derived from Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) 2016 Census data.109 Infrastructure and Operations Proportion of the population able to receive ABC digital terrestrial television transmissions (as at 30 June 2018) 2017-18 84.19% 83.15% employee morale. Upper floors of the building are now free for possible tenancy in the future. The project was completed in December 2017 and the new offices were officially opened by ABC Managing Director Michelle Guthrie in June 2018, with members of the ABC Board and the South Australian leader of the opposition also in attendance.. Ultimo Foyer & Cladding Closing the Ultimo foyer to the public and increasing building security, while providing a great coffee drop-in spot and meeting hub for ABC employees and guests, were key goals that were successfully completed during stage one of the Ultimo Foyer project. Stage two will continue into 2018-19, with a focus on the physical strengthening of the building's exterior and increased security supervision of people entering and leaving the building. Physical strengthening measures will include new ram-proof bollards and the redevelopment of the rear entrance to the ABC lower ground car park.. During the year, the ABC undertook an assessment of the cladding used on its buildings for compliance with the current Building Code of Australia Fire Safety Standards. The assessment identified the need to carry out certain repairs and modifications to the ABC's existing Ultimo, New South Wales building, which the ABC Board and management have committed to undertake. Work has already commenced, and will continue over the 2018-19 financial year. The cladding was commonly used when the buildings were originally constructed in 1992 and 2002. Independent experts assessed relevant safety issues, and advised that employees were safe to remain in the building. The ABC reviewed all other ABC-owned properties and found that none were clad with the kind of material used at Ultimo. Integrated Media System (IMS) In 2017-18, the IMS project schedule was revised, with activities brought forward - and the project is now ahead of schedule. All Tasmanian, Victorian, Queensland and New South Wales capital and regional sites were completed during the year. This included the large capital city sites of Melbourne and Sydney, with very good reports received from all user groups. The accelerated project continues to rollout, with the target of two regional-site completions every three weeks in Western Australia and South Australia. The rollout will conclude in the first quarter of 2019 in the Northern Territory. News Studio Automation Because of its close integration with IMS, in 2017-18 the News automated studio rollout schedule was modified to align with the larger IMS project. In most instances, the automation system rollout followed IMS completion across the country, with Hobart, Brisbane, Canberra, Perth, Melbourne completed and Sydney well underway. This is the ABC's second generation of studio automation systems for News, replacing the original system which was commissioned in 2008-09. Melbourne Accommodation Project (MAP) After many years of planning, design, consultation and work, the MAP - which saw multiple ABC sites in Melbourne consolidated into one purpose-built modern digital multimedia centre - is largely complete. By the end of 2017-18 all employees and facilities were in the building and operational, and the project team had dissolved, handing back over $10 million of its original contingency. Minor, post-completion MAP works still open include various projects covering: television edit booths; studio house lights; the level 4 terrace; security work at loading docks, news edit desks; and ceilings and Tea Point upgrades.110 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Corporate Services Government submissions In 2017-18, the ABC made 17 submissions to Government Departments, Parliamentary committees, and review bodies on a range of topics. These included submissions to three separate Senate inquiries into proposed amendments to the ABC Act, a Government inquiry into the competitive neutrality of the public broadcasters, a Senate inquiry into the future of public interest journalism, and the Government's review of Australian and children's screen content. The ABC's reports and publications can be found at http://about.abc.net.au/reports-publications/ . Strategy and Planning In 2017-18, the ABC's Strategy team focused on problem solving in response to challenges facing the Corporation as a result of the rapidly changing, industry and policy environment. The team developed options to facilitate decision making by the Leadership Team and the ABC Board. The team also continued to lead the development and implementation of ABC-wide strategy. Major projects were undertaken to address business problems and ensure that ABC-wide initiatives aligned with the Corporation's strategic priorities. A strategic plan was developed to operationalise the Investing in Audiences strategy announced by the Managing Director in March 2017. This plan saw the creation of a number of priority projects that were driven by the Strategy team, including: a comprehensive body of work to support the case for the modernisation of the ABC the establishment of an Investing in Audiences framework, and the first phase of related initiatives assistance with the development and communication of the content restructure announced by the Managing Director in February 2018 input into the International Strategy preparation of a positioning paper on the future of sport on the ABC the development and delivery of the ABC's inaugural Content Plan for 2019 the commencement of work on a 10-year plan ongoing collaboration with other Public Service Media around common challenges, policy and best practice. The team played a key role in drafting the strategic narrative and creating the materials for the inaugural ABC Annual Public Meeting held at the beginning of 2018. Work was also initiated to support the ABC's case for funding at the expiry of the current triennium. The Strategy team continues to provide advice in support of, best practice strategic choices, and to ensure strategic priorities align and are met across all ABC teams. Corporate Communications The ABC's Managing Director, Michelle Guthrie, addressed many internal and external groups during 2017-18. Prominent speeches included: 5 August 2017 - keynote address at the GARMA Corporate Dinner 11 August 2017 - The View from the ABC: Innovation and Perspectives of the Media Landscape - public lecture as part of Charles Sturt University's 'Exploration' series 14 September 2017 - panel address at the Royal Television Society Cambridge Convention 6 October 2017 - speech to the ABC Friends Public Conference Dinner 20 October 2017 - address on diversity and inclusion to the World Economic Forum Young Global Leaders Annual Forum 16 November 2017 - keynote address and Q&A at Screen Producers Australia - Screen Forever conference in Melbourne111 Corporate Services 30 January 2018 - Leadership, change and the challenges of disruption in the broadcast industry - address to the 22nd Women in Leadership and Management Summit in Sydney 24 April 2018 - address to the APOS CEO Forum in Indonesia 19 June 2018 - Value, Investment and Return: Why the ABC and public broadcasting is vital to the community - address to the Melbourne Press Club Some of the Managing Director's speeches are publicly available on the ABC's website at http://about.abc.net.au/speeches/ . Audiences The Investing in Audiences strategy was the bedrock for marketing strategy and activities throughout 2017-18. Reaching and engaging more people, more frequently, was at the heart of the team's approach. This was underscored by two core strategic objectives: increasing digital reach; and increasing the frequency of audience engagement with the ABC. To achieve these strategic imperatives, the focus was on: the prioritisation of content to ensure the greatest possible scale, reach and impact - essentially, 'fewer, bigger, better' marketing campaigns a drive to increase audience engagement across the ABC's linear, digital and third- party networks the optimisation of resources (people and inventory). A Partnerships function was established within the Audiences team, to craft and deliver a pan-ABC partnership strategy via coordination with key internal stakeholders. The marketing function was consolidated into a streamlined single marketing delivery team, to align with the new genre approach adopted by the ABC content teams at the start of 2018. Intended outcomes of this consolidation were: a unified, pan-ABC audience growth strategy for delivering in line with the Investing in Audiences strategy and product roadmap a reset opportunity for pan-ABC marketing prioritisation with focused resources for prioritised campaign delivery increased capability around performance-led brand management increased accountability for achieving objectives laid out in the 2018 pan-ABC Brand Marketing Plan better defined processes to identify and develop high performing talent. A new Audience Planning team was proposed, specifically tasked with audience management and bringing cohesion to planning and implementation across the whole Audiences team. The Audience Data and Insights team was also restructured. It formed in response to a number of factors: the shifting needs and demands of the business and new genre teams; the identification of efficiencies afforded by new workflows; and capitalising on the gains of recent automation. The team structure was realigned to match skillsets. Stakeholder managers were created within the team to manage key business partners across the organisation, and cross-platform subject matter experts were established, fully supported by primary research, insights, data science and data solutions expertise. As a result, a more agile team was created, focused on continued automation and data accessibility, business-wide visibility, and the provision of quality audience insights to inform business decisions. Extensive information about the ABC's audiences, and their engagement with ABC content and services, can be found throughout the Annual Report.112 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Legal Services In 2017-18, ABC Legal Services followed a twin track of supporting key initiatives related to the ABC's Investing in Audiences Strategy, while continuing to provide professional advice in its traditional areas of pre- publication advisory and training; disputes; acquisition and productions; and technology and commercial. Legal expanded on its services in 2017-18 to include Freedom of Information (FOI), Privacy, Company Secretary and Corporate Governance. The Team was also instrumental in driving the ABC's submissions to the Digital platforms inquiry and the Inquiry into the competitive neutrality of the national broadcasters.Throughout the year, Legal provided 24/7 pre-publication advice to ABC content-makers, including on extensive news coverage and ground-breaking investigations for 7.30 , Australian Story , Background Briefing , Compass and Media Watch , and on a range of Four Corners ' award-winning stories. Advice was also provided for entertainment and specialist programs such as Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell , The Checkout , Gruen , Tonightly with Tom Ballard and The Weekly with Charlie Pickering , and for new content such as the Trace and Unravel podcasts. ABC Legal successfully resolved or defended a number of complaints, threatened legal actions, and litigation. Lawyers also challenged suppression orders and made applications for access to court materials to assist story research. The team continues to manage the ABC's extensive trademark portfolio and to enforce our media assets as necessary. Above: The House with Annabel Crabb113 Corporate Services ABC Legal continued its media law training program, delivering a series of specialised media law workshops for journalists and content-makers around Australia. The program aims to minimise the ABC's exposure to legal liability while ensuring important stories can be told, and covers topics such as contempt of court, defamation, and newsgathering risks. Legal prepared and settled finance and production agreements with Australian producers, and Australian and international financiers, for many television programs, for example dramas Rosehaven and Rake ; entertainment series Anh's Brush with Fame ; children's program Little J and Big Cuz ; and significant factual programs War on Waste and Stargazing Live . ABC Legal supported a number of cross-platform initiatives by contracting major events such as The Invictus Games, the Paul Kelly concert, New Year's Eve celebrations, and Anzac Day coverage. ABC lawyers assisted News, Analysis & Investigations to remove the geoblock from the ABC NEWS live stream, and legal advice was provided to many areas of the Corporation on digital initiatives and strategies, contracts relating to app design, acquisition of technology services, property leasing and building maintenance. ABC Commercial activities such as content licensing, book and magazine publishing, and music recording, licensing, and publishing, all required the assistance of Legal. In 2017-18 Legal began to implement the ABC's Privacy framework, in response to changing legislative requirements and the Corporation's shift towards greater digital engagement with our audience. Business Affairs Business Affairs negotiates the rights and deal terms required by the ABC in content produced, commissioned and acquired by the ABC content teams, as well as associated rights required by ABC Commercial. Since March 2018, Business Affairs has been part of the Entertainment & Specialist content team, ensuring that the ABC's rights closely align to the ABC content strategy across broadcast and digital platforms. Business Affairs works with all ABC content teams to coordinate rights in cross-platform events and national conversations, and to manage the ABC's music negotiations. The team continues to play an important governance role and to ensure the ABC's investment in content delivers value for audiences. In 2017-18, Business Affairs continued to secure the rights necessary to extend the ABC's digital offering to ensure the ABC remains relevant and accessible to Australian audiences - including extended catch up and binge viewing on its broadcast content and extensive digital and social media rights for its digital-first content. The team also continued to work closely with the Entertainment & Specialist content teams to secure the rights to content co-produced between Australian independent producers and international broadcasters and publishers such as ABC Studios International (US), YouTube, Netflix and AMC Sundance. Working closely with key industry organisations Screen Producers Australia and the Media Entertainment & Arts Alliance, Business Affairs secured the rights to re-licence Australian comedy content for the successful launch of the ABC Comedy channel. Business Affairs also facilitated joint digital initiatives with state and federal screen agencies to invest in innovative digital content creation, including the ABC/Screen Australia initiatives Fresh Blood , Art Bites , Straight out of the Straits and Shock Treatment . Some of these involved emerging talent, and Business Affairs continued to provide support and guidance to new producers.114 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Responsibility Image: Barrie Cassidy presents Insiders115 116 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018117 Corporate Responsibility Corporate Responsibility 1. Version G3.1. Management of corporate responsibility The ABC contributes significant social value to the Australian community, and is committed to conducting its day-to-day activities with integrity, diligence, and transparency, and to maintaining the trust of the community. Responsibility for implementing and demonstrating corporate social responsibility rests with every ABC employee. The ABC's Corporate Responsibility Policy reinforces the ABC's commitment to acting ethically and responsibly in all areas of its operations. The Policy outlines the ABC's commitment to key principles of corporate social responsibility, which include adhering to relevant laws and regulations, respecting human rights, being accountable and transparent, and engaging in a collegiate manner with both internal and external stakeholder groups. Reporting performance The ABC reports its corporate responsibility and sustainability performance each financial year in the Annual Report, with additional information available throughout the year on the Corporate Responsibility webpage at http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/corporate-responsibility/ . Other than references to the ABC's international activities, the Annual Report is limited to domestic operations within the direct control of the ABC. Sustainability information about the ABC's investments in MediaHub Australia Pty Limited, Freeview Australia Limited, and National DAB Licence Company Limited is not included in the report. Any additional limitations to the scope or completeness of particular data are identified within the reported data.The ABC is guided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines and the associated Media Sector Supplement document to report its performance. 1 The GRI framework provides a common language for organisations to measure and report their sustainability performance so that stakeholders can view a more complete picture of the organisation's financial and non-financial activities and performance. Stakeholder inclusiveness The ABC provides opportunities for its audiences and other stakeholders to provide input into the content and activities of the Corporation. In 2017-18, mechanisms for engaging with external stakeholders included: the ABC Corporate Tracking Program the ABC Quality & Distinctiveness Study (via YourABC) formal audience contacts and complaints processes (see page 139) ABC Advisory Council processes (see page 42) the Annual Public Meeting (see page 46) online feedback mechanisms specific to ABC content areas the ABC's social media properties.

The ABC's commitment to impartiality and diversity of perspectives reflects the need for a democratic society to deliver diverse sources of reliable information and contending opinions. In pursuing impartiality, the ABC is guided by the following: a balance that follows the weight of evidence fair treatment open-mindedness opportunities over time for principal relevant perspectives on matters of contention to be expressed. The ABC seeks to balance the public interest in disclosure of information and freedom of expression, with respect for privacy. Accessibility of content and services In 2017-18 the ABC continued to take steps to improve the accessibility of its content and services. Improving access for people with a hearing impediment Captioning is the process by which speech or scenes are described in text for viewing on screen. Closed captioning indicates the availability of text that can be activated by users if required. The ABC provides a closed captioning service on ABC main channel, ABC COMEDY, ABC KIDS, ABC ME and ABC NEWS. In 2017-18, almost 8000 hours of first-run programming across all channels had captioning available. Between 6am and midnight, the ABC captioned 100% of programs on ABC main channel, 85% on ABC2/COMEDY and 70% on ABC ME. On ABC KIDS, more than 80% of the programming broadcast programming was available with closed captions. More than 55% of content broadcast on ABC NEWS was captioned and - where available - included signing for the hearing impaired. The ABC provides greater access to key events by providing captions for broadcasts such as Anzac Day marches and memorial services, and Australia Day events. Other notable events that were captioned during 2017-18 included the ceremonies for the Centenary of the Battle of Beersheba and the 75 th anniversary of the Kokoda campaign, the Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Stargazing Live , the 2018 New Year's Eve concert and evening events, the 2018 Junior Eurovision contest, the 2018 Golden Guitar Awards and Tropfest 2018. A range of new programs were captioned in advance of broadcast for iview binges, as were iview-exclusive programs such as Media Bites , the Art Bites series, Seed and selections of complementary 'extras' content. An episode of Seed featuring a young blind drummer was also made available with Audio description for viewers with a visual impairment. Improving access for people with a visual impairment In 2017-18, 30 titles published by ABC Books were made available through ReadHowYouWant, an Australian service that offers print-on-demand re-format publishing for people unable to read standard formatted books. Text is enlarged and customised to suit the capabilities of the reader. ABC Audio provided an extensive range of genre and age-diverse audio books accessible to the vision impaired and people with a print handicap. In 2017-18, ABC Audio released 104 titles in both physical and digital formats, through licence agreement with audio book publisher Bolinda. Of 119 Corporate Responsibility in a Broadcasting Context those, 10 included ABC-devised content, 65 were adult titles, and 39 were children's titles. In April 2017, the Minister for Communications announced the formation of an Audio Description Working Group (ADWG), to be managed by the Department of Communications and the Arts. The ABC participated as a member of the ADWG along with the other free-to-air and subscription television networks, advocacy groups for the blind and visually impaired, Audio Description providers, and media accessibility experts. The ADWG's final report was provided to the Minister in December 2017, and is available on the Department's website. Digital accessibility The ABC strives for equal access to its digital websites, mobile applications and documents by people with limited vision, hearing, speech, mobility or cognition, in accordance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0). In 2017-18, many new ABC services - and enhancements to existing services - were scrutinised for best practice digital accessibility. In February 2018, the ABC's inaugural Annual Public Meeting was broadcast live across the internet and social media. Accessibility was a key consideration: Auslan interpretation and live captions for people with impaired hearing were provided, as was comprehensive transcription for people who are blind or who otherwise use assistive technologies to read digital content. ABC music networks contributed to accessibility throughout the year. ABC Classic FM added subtitles to its social videos and complied with accessibility requirements when developing campaign and station artwork. The ABC's internal accessibility team worked with triple j on the station's new website, launched in mid-2017, and the updated triple j app was tested to ensure accessibility for the vision-impaired, in line with the current Hottest 100 website. Above: Susie Youssef and Rose Matafeo in Squinters120 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Protecting young or vulnerable audiences The ABC's Editorial Policy framework sets out guidelines to protect vulnerable audiences such as children. Advice and training in the ABC Editorial Policies is delivered on an ongoing basis, and upward referral - a key concept of the policies - ensures complex decisions are not made in isolation. All television programs other than news, current affairs and sporting events, are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. The ABC ensures that graphic or distressing news content is preceded by a warning, to give readers, listeners, or viewers the opportunity to avoid the content if they choose. Content created especially for children and available on iview or apps is accompanied by classification advice and warnings where appropriate. As with broadcast, children's content on digital properties is restricted to G and PG. Both the ABC KIDS iview and ABC ME apps, along with the main iview service, include a parental filter so parents can control their children's viewing boundaries.The ABC's websites for children follow strict protocols in line with Editorial Policies to minimise risk to children, for example regarding privacy. With the creation of content and experiences for children across all platforms, consideration of sensitivities and risk is paramount. The online protection of children is a shared responsibility between the ABC, the parent/ guardian, and the child. The ABC aims to ensure that children and young people who engage with the ABC's online spaces understand the possible risks they face and how to minimise them. Providing information about online safety is encouraged on ABC sites designed for children. ABC Regional and Local's user-generated content projects, ABC Open and Heywire, have clear moderation guidelines that address how they handle sensitive content and 'at risk' contributors or audiences. Measures can be implemented to protect contributors and audience members. In addition to being guided by the editorial policies, Heywire consulted with a range of youth mental health organisations such as Headspace to create a Code of Conduct for all adults attending Heywire, in order to provide guidance on how Image: Trying out ABC KIDS listen at the Teddy Bear's Picnic in Darwin121 Corporate Responsibility in a Broadcasting Context best to support young people attending the summit, manage difficult situations that may arise, and minimise any risk of harm. Where required, steps are taken to protect the anonymity of contributors who are writing about sensitive issues, such as domestic violence or mental illness. Contributors are invited to use an alias and generic file images when writing about sensitive topics. On occasion, details may be edited or removed from a contribution or user profile to protect the identity of the author. Contributors are also encouraged to avoid sharing this kind of content on their personal social media accounts if there is a chance they could be identified as the author. ABC Open works closely with organisations such as Mindframe and the Department of Social Services' 'Stop It At The Start' campaign to make sure that its editorial processes are aligned with the best practice approach for handling sensitive content. In consultation with these organisations, a list of support services was developed to add to the end of contributions that touch on these issues. Trigger warnings are added to specific pieces of content as required. triple j has strategies in place to ensure its younger audiences are protected from harm and offence. Editorial content which is likely to cause harm or offence to younger sections of the audience is scheduled in appropriate time periods such as later in the evening - for example, The Hook Up, which discusses sex and relationships, is programmed for after 9pm on Sundays. Further, warnings are given before playing music containing language or content that is assessed as likely to offend the triple j audience. Warnings are also given prior to other types of content which risk causing harm to vulnerable audiences. All ABC DVD product is subject to formal classification by the Classification Board, and appropriate warnings/guides are attached to each product. ABC CDs display appropriate warnings regarding language and content. ABC Commercial's Events business contracts event management to third party promoters. Under these event management contracts, promoters are required to warrant that all event venues will be safe and fit for purpose. The contracts also stipulate promoters must conduct themselves in accordance with all international, national, federal, state, and local laws, and treaties. ABC Commercial's promoter agreements explicitly ensure current compliance with state and territory-based legislation regarding working with children. Improving digital literacy In 2018, the ABC in conjunction with the University of Tasmania launched a Media Literacy Project. The project aims to support audiences - and young people in particular - to engage in critical media consumption and gain a greater understanding of the politics, biases and commercial imperatives embedded in technologies, platforms and digital media. The ABC created a dedicated Media Education Partnerships role to lead this and other ABC projects and activities aimed at helping Australians better navigate the news. ABC News also reported widely on the consequences for individuals of data breaches, data sharing and online scams. For example, the Digital Storytelling Team's 'Chart Of The Day' series encouraged users to develop responsible password habits, offered explanations of how encryption works, and explored the inner workings of smartphones, social media algorithms, attitudes towards privacy, and the impact of bandwidth on video streaming and gaming. Further, ABC News sponsored the development of the remarkable Kokoda VR project to mark the 75th anniversary of the Kokoda campaign. 122 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Environmental Responsibility Energy In 2017-18, overall ABC energy consumption increased slightly, with a 0.4% change from 2016-17. Energy consumption State/Territory 2017-18 2016-17* reported in 2016-17 were based on forecast consumption and have been updated to reflect actual consumption in the above table. The nature of ABC business, and in particular its reliance on technology, necessarily involves high levels of energy consumption. This was reflected in the energy use figures for New South Wales where there is a significant concentration of the ABC's workforce and production. Energy reduction initiatives in 2017-18 included: physical changes to the configuration of buildings or spaces, for example the Renewing Adelaide project which consolidated employees from six floors to three, with air conditioning and lights turned off on where possible and across all ABC buildings, faulty lighting being replaced with retrofit LED replacement units - in the Adelaide and Ultimo refits, any lighting changes used LED lighting air conditioning units being replaced or upgraded to inverter/high efficiency units (Bunbury, Albany, Ballarat, Shepparton, Launceston) the replacement of power factor units in Hobart HVAC filter and coil replacements and cleaning, an upgraded Building Management System (BMS), replacement of film vault air conditioning units, and leak repairs and removal of ozone depleting refrigerant, at the Ultimo and Lanceley Place sites atrium smoke damper repairs in Ultimo, which resulted in a reduction in the loss of conditioned air escaping to the atmosphere.123 Environmental Responsibility Emissions The ABC uses the National Green Accounts (NGA) factors published by the Department of the Environment and Energy to identify and quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2017-18, the ABC captured electricity data via the BidEnergy platform for electricity, while data for diesel generators and gas consumption was manually extracted. There was a 6% increase in emissions overall in 2017-18, when compared with 2016-17 levels.

The continued rollout of Flexible Work Environment (FEW) spaces across ABC worksites, and increases in online workflows, is and will continue to be reflected in ongoing significant reductions in power, paper and toner usage. Other more targeted initiatives in 2017-18 included ABC Brisbane removing all under-desk bins. This move resulted in a significant change in the amount of that waste material ending up in landfill; from 100% landfill to 50% diversion to recycling. 125 Environmental Responsibility Environmental sustainability in the supply chain Where appropriate, ABC tender documentation and evaluation criteria required information about suppliers' corporate responsibility (including environmental) commitments and practices. The ABC does not manage the businesses of service providers Broadcast Australia Infrastructure, Telstra or Optus, and as such has no clauses within the contracts to enforce any green initiatives. Wherever possible it is assumed these businesses attempt to reduce energy consumption, which in turn reduces costs. The ABC applies the mandatory environmental standards (ES1 and ES2) of the Federal Government's ICT Sustainability Plan 2010-15 to all procurements of ICT equipment. PC suppliers are expected to comply with Green ICT requirements including minimal packaging and the use of recyclable material.Travel and transport Although the nature of the ABC's operations (particularly its news and current affairs activities) necessitates frequent domestic and international travel, the ABC encourages employees to reduce domestic travel as much as possible. Employees are encouraged to consider alternatives to travel where appropriate, for instance utilising video conferencing. The ABC also encourages employees to use sustainable travel methods to get to and from work such as walking, cycling or taking public transport. End-of-trip facilities for employees including secure bike parking, showers and lockers are provided at most capital city and some regional sites. Information about public transport is provided on the ABC intranet. Travel by air There was a 30.5% increase in kilometres flown by ABC employees in 2017-18, compared to the previous year.

Two were hybrid vehicles.126 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Water In 2017-18, the ABC's water consumption was reduced overall by 12.5% on the previous period. Water consumption *Figures reported in 2016-17 were based on forecast consumption and have been updated to reflect actual consumption in the above table. Total ABC consumption includes 8 out of 8 capital city sites and 28 out of 52 regional sites. In 2017-18, rainwater was collected at 13 separate ABC sites across the country, with most of the water collected predominantly reticulated for use in toilet cisterns.

The EPBC Act sets out the ABC's responsibilities to protect and conserve the Commonwealth Heritage values of places which it owns or controls. The Strategy is intended to inform the Minister and the Australian Heritage Council of the identification, assessment and monitoring of Commonwealth Heritage values demonstrated by places owned or controlled by the ABC. The 2018-2021 Strategy has been lodged with the Department of Environment and Energy, which administers the EPBA Act. The Heritage Strategy will be made available online when it has been approved by the Department.128 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Social Responsibility Times of emergency A long year of fires, floods, and cyclones meant ABC Emergency broadcasting teams were extremely busy assisting communities with warnings and information throughout 2017-18. Emergency broadcasting was provided during 256 separate events. Of these, most occurred in Victoria (60), followed by Queensland (51), New South Wales (46), South Australia (46), Western Australia (33), Tasmania (8), Australian Capital Territory (6) and Northern Territory (5). The ABC Emergency team also assisted ABC Radio Australia in providing Pacific region audiences with emergency information about Cyclone Hola as it impacted Vanuatu, and Cyclone Gita's impact on Tonga. Details of these events can be found in Emergency broadcasting , in Volume II, pages 51-3. Social responsibility in the community Community service announcements The ABC broadcasts announcements about community issues or events which are in the public interest, subject to the ABC Editorial Policies' Standard 9 (Public access and participation). Due to its localisation and immediacy, radio is the primary medium via which the ABC provides this information. In 2017-18 a range of issues of relevance to the community were broadcast, including announcements around important appeals such as the Giving Tree appeal and the Myanmar appeal. Humanitarian appeals The ABC works with Australian and international aid agencies during crises and humanitarian aid appeals when it is appropriate and possible to do so, highlighting the work of these agencies as they attempt to provide shelter, food, education, healthcare, and other forms of relief. The ABC Appeals website at http://www.abc.net.au/appeals/ provides information about current crises and suggests appropriate agencies to which audiences can donate. In 2017 the ABC supported the Australian Red Cross, Australia for UNHCR, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the six Australian Humanitarian Partnership agencies, in raising funds to assist those affected by the violence in Rakhine State, Myanmar. At the time, hundreds of thousands of people had fled to Bangladesh since violence erupted in the state on 25 August 2017, most of them Muslim Rohingyas. An estimated 150,000 were also displaced within Rakhine State. The appeal was promoted across all ABC platforms from Sunday 19 to Friday 24 November 2017. Connecting with communities The ABC's Investing in Audiences strategy saw a reinvigorated and expansive focus on connecting with all Australian communities throughout 2017-18, both directly and through its broadcasting services. The ABC also connects with communities outside Australia. ABC International Development (ABCID) enables partner organisations in the Asia-Pacific region to pursue quality journalism, engaging storytelling and building strong connections with their communities. These many and varied connections are detailed in Yours in the Community , in Volume II, pages 40-53. Social responsibility in the workplace Information about the ABC's values at work, workplace health and safety, and diversity in the workplace, can be found in pages 90-103. The ABC's employees are also committed to creating a wealth of content that reflects the diversity of its audiences. Information about the ABC's social investment via its content can be found throughout the Annual Report. 129 Social Responsibility Mental health in the workplace Converge International provides ABC employees with comprehensive, independent Employee Assistance Program (EAP) services through qualified specialists. These services are confidential and free-of-charge, and are available to all employees and their immediate family through self-referral. Face-to-face, telephone and Skype sessions are available. All EAP services are available 24 hours 7 days, both locally and internationally. During 2017-18, an additional dedicated LGTBIQ EAP service was provided to employees. Converge International is also available to assist employees who are retiring. Services offered include short-term solution-based counselling to work through some of the changes the employee may face in relation to retirement, and 'Money Assist' financial counselling to help work through financial wellbeing concerns. These services are also made available to employees whose employment is terminated due to redundancy, along with 'Career Assist' career development and planning assistance. This assistance provides independent and impartial advice around resumes, job-seeking, interview skills and vocational counselling, from professional career consultants.In addition, the ABC offers access to an outplacement service to employees whose position is redundant. The outplacement service provider delivers a tailored career transition program to those employees, which includes a range of topics to help employees deal with change including analysing career options, assistance with resume preparation, and developing job search and interview skills. ABC management are also conscious of the impact of emergency broadcasting on the physical and mental health of employees. They support the ABC Trauma and Resilience Programs, which provide employees access to specialist clinicians, on a confidential referral basis. Employees affected by potentially traumatic events in the course of their work are able to access up to 6 sessions. Employees appointed to international bureaux are provided with a dedicated clinician for the duration of their appointment. Employees are also able to access peer-to-peer psychological first aid through the Trauma Peer Support program. At the end of 2017-18, there were 65 peer support leaders across the ABC. These programs augment in-house training courses and advisory services in trauma. During the 2017-18 period, the ABC rolled out training sessions that specifically addressed 130 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018supporting employees and managers through change and maintaining resilience during periods of change (see Volume II, page 96). Product responsibility Product information and labelling The ABC ensures all products are appropriately labelled. No changes to the ABC's policy or practices regulating product information or labelling were made during 2017-18. If applicable, packaging does display information about appropriate disposal of the packaging. Examples include: \"Warning! Plastic Bag can be dangerous. To avoid danger of suffocation, keep this bag away from babies and children. Please dispose of all packaging responsibly.\" \"Dispose of all packaging ties before giving to your child.\" Battery disposal notification symbol ABC licensed merchandise packaging is clearly marked if the packing is a potential hazard. Quality assurance All licensees of ABC branded merchandise have contractual obligations to manufacture high quality products that meet Australian Standards applicable to the product. Children's products are Safety Tested to the Standards AS/NZS ISO 8124 parts 1, 2 and 3 if applicable. Products aimed at adults may also be required to be tested to relevant standards. Licensees are required to provide certificates to prove the test results. If there are no applicable Australian Standards or testing procedures for a product aimed at children, the ABC requires that licensees or manufacturers perform tests that conform to American or European testing, to safeguard product safety and quality. Licensees test for colourfastness, shrinkage and flammability of apparel products. These products are required to meet retailers' individual standards.Product complaints and recalls In 2017-18, there were no product recalls or instances of non-compliance with safety standards associated with products produced, distributed, licensed or sold by the ABC. In light of the legislated requirement to report death within 48 hours to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) any products that have caused, or may cause, serious injury, the ABC developed a comprehensive Product Recall Procedure. The procedure covers all products that ABC Commercial produces, distributes, licenses, and sells through ABC Shop Online, as well as ABC-branded products that are sold through other retailers. The procedure stipulates that once a product recall has been initiated, the ACCC guidelines are followed. Customer safety and satisfaction is of paramount concern to the ABC when it comes to the creation and distribution of quality products and services.

In particular, section 6 of the Act - the ABC Charter - outlines the functions of the Corporation, and section 8 lays out the duties of the Board (see Appendix 1 , Volume II pages 204-5). The ABC Act expressly provides for both the editorial and administrative independence of the Corporation, thereby investing the Board with considerable discretion. In acknowledgement of that independence, the ABC accepts the obligation to meet the highest standards of public accountability. Responsible Minister The ABC is an agency within the portfolio of the Department of Communications and the Arts. Over the entire 2017-18 reporting period, the responsible Minister was Senator the Honourable Mitch Fifield. Governance and management processes Board governance The roles and responsibilities of the Board are described in Appendix 1 (Volume II, pages 204-5). The ABC Board held nine meetings during 2017-18.The Audit, Risk & Finance Committee met on three occasions, the Risk & Audit Committee met on two occasions, and the People & Remuneration Committee (formerly People Committee) met on four occasions. Further information about the ABC Board and its Committees is provided in Appendix 2 (Volume II, pages 205-8). Management processes Throughout 2017-18, the Managing Director chaired a monthly, day-long meeting of the ABC Leadership Team, comprising Team Directors and the Heads of specialist support units reporting to her. These meetings enabled the Leadership Team to discuss and make decisions regarding strategic, operational and compliance issues, including matters relating to the ABC's cross-divisional audience strategy. The Leadership Team also met briefly each week. The ABC's governance framework included a number of executive and advisory groups which provided guidance and leadership around areas such as digital strategy, risk management, information technology, work health and safety, and policy development. Corporate Plan The ABC's strategy is informed by the broader corporate objectives and outcomes in the ABC Corporate Plan. The requirement to prepare a corporate plan in accordance with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (the PGPA Act) came into effect on 1 July 2015. Under section 35 of the PGPA Act, the accountable authority of the ABC is required to prepare a corporate plan at least once each reporting period. The corporate plan must be prepared in accordance with the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule 2014 (the PGPA Rule). The ABC Corporate Plan 2017-18 was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the PGPA Act and PGPA Rule and is published on the ABC's corporate website at http://about.abc.net.au/reports-publications/ . The ABC Corporate Plan 2017-18 also meets the requirements of section 31B(1) of the ABC Act by outlining the overall strategies and policies that the Corporation will follow to ensure that the Board fulfils its duties under section 8 of the ABC Act, and includes a forecast of the revenue and expenditure of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, including a forecast of capital expenditure and borrowings. In 2017-18, the Strategy team continued to lead the development and implementation of ABC strategy and planning. For more on their activities see Volume II, page 110.135 Risk Risk How well the ABC manages its risks is central to how it is governed. It is a key pillar upon which our good reputation is founded, and forms the basis of the trust our stakeholders place in us. The ABC looks not only to the risks that exist today but what risks may develop in the future; a critical approach to take as the Corporation experiences one of the most significant changes to the way it operates in its long history. The ABC's audiences not only expect world-class Australian content, they expect that they will be able to watch, listen and access that content seamlessly. A key role of business continuity is to ensure that the business runs to that schedule, and when circumstances change we can respond in a quick and considered way. Risk Management The ABC's Board of Directors and management oversee, and continue to be committed to, developing and refining a fit-for-purpose risk management framework that will both protect and enhance value through the timely and accurate identification, assessment and management of all risks. The ABC Risk function is responsible for the continued refinement of the ABC risk management framework. This includes providing counsel to the Board and management on how to identify, assess and manage risk. During 2017-18 a Head of Risk was appointed, and the role has further embedded risk considerations in the annual business planning, strategy and budgetary cycle. The ABC continues to refine how we record and analyse risk incidents so as to provide for close to real-time insights to the Board and management on the effectiveness of the risk management framework. A comprehensive all-employees program of risk-related learning and development, which will support the enhancement of a positive risk culture and help maintain risk management capability across the Corporation, was further developed in 2017-18. 136 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Audit Internal audit Group Audit provides independent and objective assurance that the design and operation of the ABC's risk management and internal control system is effective. A risk-based audit approach is used to ensure Group Audit focuses its work on the ABC's key objectives and operational areas, including those set out in the Investing in Audiences strategy. Audits are conducted in a matter that conforms to international auditing standards. Group Audit is responsible to the Risk & Audit Committee for contributing to the achievement of the Corporation's goals and objectives by: assisting management in evaluating processes for identifying, assessing and managing the key operational, financial and compliance risks evaluating the effectiveness of internal control systems, including compliance with legislative requirements and internal policies, and recommending improvements to management playing a role in developing and maintaining a culture of accountability and integrity, including undertaking investigations in relation to fraud or public interest disclosure allegations being responsive to the ABC's changing needs and striving for continuous improvement in the performance of its activities facilitating and supporting the integration of risk management into day-to-day business activities and processes.Group Audit is responsible for preparing and implementing the ABC's Audit Plan, which seeks to ensure that audits focus on key areas of risk to the ABC. The Audit Plan is approved by the Risk & Audit Committee. In 2017-18, Group Audit completed 28 scheduled audits, including evaluation of commissioning, production and broadcast activities and coverage of compliance, information technology, health and safety and project management processes. The team also performed unscheduled reviews at the specific request of management and the Risk & Audit Committee, and utilised technology to undertake continuous auditing and monitoring of transactional data. Group Audit also provided advice and guidance on good governance, policies and controls, and fraud risks. During 2017-18 Group Audit continued to operate with a combination of in-house employees and external providers. This provided access to expertise in specialist areas and supplemented internal resources and experience. Coordination with external auditors Group Audit liaises with the ABC's external auditors the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), and its nominated representative, KPMG. This includes seeking advice on proposed areas of focus; the identification of areas of potential external audit reliance on audits undertaken by Group Audit; and ensuring that there is minimal duplication of audit coverage. 137 Social Responsibility Corporate reporting Compliance reporting Any significant non-compliance with the finance law must be reported to the responsible Minister under section 19(1)(e) of the PGPA Act and must also be disclosed in the Annual Report together with an outline of the action taken to remedy the non-compliance. To meet these requirements, in 2017-18 the ABC continued to implement its internal compliance reporting framework. The compliance framework comprises internal controls and governance procedures together with other sources of assurance and information to ensure that relevant PGPA Act reporting requirements are achieved. There were no instances of significant non- compliance required to be notified to the responsible Minister under section 19(1)(e) of the PGPA Act during the 2017-18 reporting period. Annual Report The ABC is required by section 46 of the PGPA Act to prepare an annual report. The report must be submitted to the responsible minister for presentation to the Parliament. The ABC Annual Report 2017 was submitted to the Minister for Communications and was tabled in Parliament on 26 October 2017. Report against the ABC Corporate Plan Performance against the ABC Corporate Plan 2017-18 is set out in the ABC's 2018 Annual Performance Statements (Volume II, pages 80-9). Freedom of Information The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (the FOI Act) gives the public the right to access documents held by the ABC. During 2017-18, the ABC received 41 requests for access to documents under the FOI Act. Three requests were granted in full, six were granted in part, 22 were refused, and five were withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn, with two of those requests dealt with outside of the formal FOI process. Five requests were still being processed at the end of the financial year. Of the 28 requests that were refused or part- refused, 16 were (or involved some documents that were) outside the scope of the FOI Act. Section 7 and Part II of Schedule 2 of the FOI Act specifically exempts documents relating to the ABC's program material from the operation of the FOI Act. Four matters were the subject of Internal Review. Three of the decisions were affirmed on review. Six decisions were the subject of review by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC). Two of those applications were withdrawn, and four were still being processed as at 30 June 2018. In accordance with section 8(1) of the FOI Act, the ABC has prepared an Agency Plan which describes how the ABC will comply with the Information Publication Scheme (IPS) requirements set out in Part II of the FOI Act. This Plan is currently under review and will be updated over 2018-19. The ABC's IPS Agency Plan and FOI Disclosure Log are published on the ABC's corporate website at http://about.abc.net.au/how-the-abc-is-run/what-guides-us/freedom-of-information/ .138 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Privacy The ABC is required to comply with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) in the Privacy Act 1988 . The ABC Privacy Policy is published on the ABCs corporate website. The Policy sets out the kind of information the ABC will collect, the circumstances in which the ABC may use and disclose such information, how individuals may access their personal information, and how and to whom individuals may complain about a breach of privacy. There were a number of changes to privacy law in 2018, including the introduction of mandatory data breach reporting for certain data breaches. On 1 July 2018 the Australian Government Agencies Privacy Code (the Code) commenced. The Code requires agencies, such as the ABC, to move towards a best practice approach to privacy governance. In accordance with the Code the ABC has, among other things, developed a privacy management plan and appointed privacy champions to provide privacy leadership and promote the value of personal information within the ABC. In 2017-18 there was one privacy breach which required the ABC to notify the Privacy Commissioner. Like many organisations the ABC used PageUp software to manage its recruitment services. PageUp experienced a malicious attack and the ABC worked with other organisations and the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) to manage the effects of the breach. People affected by the disclosure were notified. The ABC suspended use of the software until such time as it was determined by independent cybersecurity experts that there was no further threat. The ABC notified a data exposure to the OAIC in November 2017. That notification concerned data that the ABC had not properly secured on an Amazon service. Although it was determined that the exposure was not likely to result in serious harm, there were a number of media reports and the OAIC was notified of the circumstances of the exposure. The ABC has taken steps to prevent any future exposure of this nature.139 Audience feedback Audience feedback Audience contacts The ABC monitors audience responses to transmission issues via its Reception Advice Line (RAL). The unit assists the public to improve their ABC television and radio reception, responds to broader ABC transmission enquiries, and works with the ABC's transmission providers to identify and resolve transmission faults. RAL operating hours are Monday to Friday 9am to 5.30pm (Sydney time) and the web service is available 24 hours, 7 days. Data on television and radio service enquiries for 2017-18 is available in Volume II, page 86 (in the Annual Performance Statements). Written complaints about issues such as factual inaccuracy, bias or inappropriate content are referred to the ABC's Audience and Consumer Affairs unit. Audience and Consumer Affairs is independent of ABC program areas and can investigate written complaints referring to possible breaches of the ABC Editorial Policies or the ABC Code of Practice. The unit also coordinates responses to a range of programming and policy enquiries. The profile of contacts reported by Audience and Consumer Affairs reflects the particular remit of the unit. Written complaints alleging a breach of the ABC Code of Practice or ABC Editorial Policies received elsewhere in the ABC are required to be referred to Audience and Consumer Affairs in the first instance, whereas requests, suggestions, praise, and other comments are not. This, and the unit's specialist complaints-handling focus, means that the proportion of contacts received by Audience and Consumer Affairs which are complaints will generally be higher than those received elsewhere throughout the ABC. Audience contacts to ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs 2017-18 Contact Webform/Email/Letter/Other % of contacts 2017-18 Subject Webform/Email/Letter/Other % Total Requests for information, programs, product availability and other matters 21,022 45.9% Complaints about program standards, scheduling and other matters16,508 36.0% Appreciation of programs and presenters 3,487 7.6% Bias (other than party political)* 2,341 5.1% Complaints factual inaccuracy 1,221 2.7% Party political bias 713 1.6% Lack of balance 523 1.1% Total 45,815 100.0% *Includes claims of bias in relation to issues such as sport and religion.140 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Timeliness Audience and Consumer Affairs seeks to reply to all contacts requiring response within 30 days of receipt, in accordance with the timeliness standard for complaint handling that is specified in the ABC's Complaint Handling Procedures. Between 1 July 2017 and 30 June 2018, ABC Audience and Consumer Affairs responded directly to 7,938 audience contacts. Of these, 6,266 (78.9%) received responses within 30 days. Key concerns Compared to previous years, there were fewer issues attracting larger numbers of audience contacts. Key concerns reflected in audience contacts received by Audience and Consumer Affairs in 2017-18 included disappointment about the discontinuation of programs or the departure of presenters. There were 348 complaints and a further 53 contacts from audience members who expressed their disappointment at Red Symons' departure from ABC Radio Melbourne's Breakfast program. The decision to bring The Doctor Blake Mysteries to an end attracted 232 contacts from viewers, including 165 complaints as well as queries about when a subsequent series would be screened. The decision to cancel Lateline attracted 204 contacts including 199 complaints from viewers. A change to music listings on the ABC Classic FM website attracted 295 complaints. Track listings are now displayed automatically as pieces are broadcast, providing the station with greater flexibility and bringing the site in line with many equivalent classical music services internationally. There were 221 complaints that the NSW News was shown in place of the WA News on the 7pm News on Sunday 27 May 2018, after a technical problem was identified in the prepared WA News bulletin immediately prior to its scheduled broadcast. Complaint outcomes During 2017-18, 21,501 written complaints were finalised by Audience and Consumer Affairs. The unit provided a personal response to 4,873 of these complaints (comprising 5,052 issues), of which 3,782 (77.6%) received responses within 30 days. 8,974 complaint contacts were referred to other areas of the Corporation for direct response (including 1,254 editorial complaints) and no substantive response was required for 7,654 complaint contacts. The 4,873 responses to complaints sent by Audience and Consumer Affairs this year included two distinct groups of complaints: complaints investigated by Audience and Consumer Affairs which alleged breaches of the ABC Editorial Policies or ABC Code of Practice complaints about matters of personal preference which do not raise issues of compliance with the ABC's editorial standards, and for which Audience and Consumer Affairs provide an audience liaison service. This latter group of complaints makes up the larger number of the total. As these complaints do not go to the ABC's editorial standards, they are not formally investigated and are not capable of being upheld. During 2017-18, 1,949 complaint issues were investigated. A total of 123 (6.3%) were upheld in cases where Audience and Consumer Affairs determined that ABC editorial standards had not been met. A further 186 issues were resolved (9.5%) after the relevant content area took prompt and appropriate action to remedy the cause of the complaint. All findings in relation to upheld and resolved complaints are brought to the attention of the senior editorial staff responsible. In 2017-18, actions taken in response to upheld and resolved complaints included written apologies to complainants; on-air corrections; counselling or other action with staff; removal of inappropriate content or correction of material on ABC Online; and reviews of and improvements to procedures. Summaries of upheld and resolved complaints are published on abc.net.au as individual complaints are finalised, providing timely access to complaint decisions. The ABC also publishes a quarterly statistical overview of audience contacts on its website.141 Audience feedback Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) Members of the public who complain to the ABC about matters covered by the ABC Code of Practice and who are dissatisfied with the ABC's response, or who do not receive a response to their complaint within 60 days, may seek review from the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA). During 2017-18, the ACMA advised the ABC that it had finalised investigations into 14 such matters (compared to 16 in 2016-17). In two of those cases, the ACMA found breaches of the ABC Code of Practice. Impartiality: the ACMA found that a 7pm News story on a speech by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott MP to the Global Warming Policy Foundation was not duly impartial. While the ACMA considered that the report from the ABC's political editor demonstrated fair treatment and open-mindedness, a statement that Mr Abbott was 'the most destructive politician of his generation' was problematic and incongruent with the substance and scope of the factual matters presented earlier in the report. Impartiality: the ACMA determined that a 7pm News segment covering historical child sexual abuse allegations against deceased Tattersall's heir Dr John Flynn was not duly impartial. The ACMA found the tone and language used in the story conveyed the view that allegations against Dr Flynn were true, and the omission of Dr Flynn's earlier and explicit denial of the allegations added to the sense of prejudgment conveyed in the report. Commonwealth Ombudsman In 2017-18, the Ombudsman's office notified the ABC of a complaint lodged in the previous reporting period. The Ombudsman's office determined that the complaint did not warrant further investigation.142 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Financial StatementsImage: The Easybeats biopic Friday On My Mind starred Du Toit Bredenkamp, Will Rush, Christian Byers, Mackenzie Fearnley and Arthur McBain. Photo: Tony Mott 143 144 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Financial Summary 2017-18 Completion of Annual Financial Statements On 10 August 2018, following endorsement by the Risk and Audit Committee, the Board approved the signing of the ABC's 2017-18 Financial Statements and the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) issued an unmodified audit opinion on the ABC's 2017-18 Financial Statements. Financial Outcome 2017-18 The ABC incurred a deficit for the financial year to June 2018 due primarily to timing differences in the recognition of expenditure in relation to: recognition of a building maintenance provision following an assessment of the cladding used on ABC buildings for compliance with the current Building Code of Australia Fire Safety Standards investment in Australian content and other content initiatives during the year as part of the ABC's Investing in Audiences strategy change in the ABC's business model as technology moves more towards Software as a Service and away from physical legacy systems and capital expenditure transitions to operational expenditure.In addition, a shortfall in ABC Commercial revenue following the decline in retail sales across the industry, in particular the accelerating market trends towards streaming products and away from the ABC's traditional CD and DVD products, also contributed to the result. Sources of Funds 2017-18 The ABC was allocated $1,043.7 million in the May 2017 Federal Budget, reflecting a further decrease in base funding of $7.7 million related to the previously announced ABC/SBS Additional Efficiency Savings Measure offset by indexation on base funding and one-off funding received in relation to the previously announced Enhanced News Services initiative. The ABC also received $65.1 million from other sources, including ABC Commercial, during the year. The chart 'ABC Source of Funds' depicts the ABC's budgeted funds for the various categories against actual sources for 2017-18 and its budgeted sources for 2018-19.

However, the Government announced that from 2019-20, ABC General Operational Activities base funding indexation will be paused for three years as part of the 'Funding for Australian Film and Television Content and the National Broadcasters' measure. This will see the total reduction of ABC funding by $83.7 million over the three years 2019-20, 2020-21, and 2021-22, with an ongoing reduction to the funding base of $41.3 million per annum in future years. In 2018-19, the ABC received indexation on base funding offset by a further decrease in funding of $12.5 million arising from the previously announced ABC/SBS Additional Efficiency Savings Measure. This brings the total decrease in base funding arising from the ABC/SBS Additional Efficiency Savings Measure to $67.7 million per annum. Funding for 2018-19 includes $14.0 million for Enhanced News Services. This funding terminates on 30 June 2019.The ABC's funding for the 2018-19 financial year is: $m Total revenue from Government per Outcome 11,045.9 Less Transmission and Distribution Services180.8 Total Revenue from Government available for ABC General Activities865.1 The chart 'ABC Revenue from Government by Programme 2018-19' broadly represents the ABC's budgeted appropriation of funds by programme for the 2018-19 financial year.

The 2018-19 year also sees the fourth year of the impacts of previously announced Government funding reductions from the ABC/SBS Additional Efficiency Savings measure, as mentioned above. The ABC continues to implement various savings initiatives to address the funding cuts, comprising efficiency savings in support functions and transmission. The operational funding indexation pause announced in the May 2018 Budget reduces ABC funding by a further $83.7 million from 2019-20 to 2021-22, with an annual impact of an additional $41.3 million per annum in subsequent years. This will impact on the formulation of budget strategy for 2018-19, and its impact cannot be absorbed by efficiency measures alone, as the ABC has already achieved significant productivity gains in response to past budget cuts. The ABC will continue discussions with Government in relation to the Efficiency Review announced by the Minister in the May 2018 Budget, as well in relation to triennial funding negotiations, with the view to achieving the appropriate levels of funding necessary to deliver content and services to ensure that the ABC remains relevant to current and future audiences in the digital age. Comparative Revenue from Government The 2018-19 operational revenue from Government of $865 million represents a decrease in real funding of $358 million or 29% since 1985-86 as depicted in the chart 'ABC Operational Revenue from Government'.

The financial statements of theAustralian Broadcasting Corporation, which I have audited, comprise the following statements as at 30 June 2018 and for the year then ended: Statement by the Directors and Chief Financ ialand Strategy Officer; Statement of Comprehensive Income; Statement of Financial Position; Statement of Changes in Equity; Cash Flow Statement; and Notes to and forming a part of the financial statements ,comprising a summary of accounting policies and other explanatory information. Basis for OpinionI conducted my audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, which incorporate the Australian Auditing Standards. My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of my report. I am independent of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements for financial statement audits conducted by the Auditor -General and his delegates. Thes e include the relevant independence requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (the Code) to the extent that they are not in conflict with the Auditor -General Act 1997 . I h ave also fulfilled my other responsibilities in accordance with the Code. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. Accountable Authority's Responsibility for the Financial Statements As the Accountable Authority ,the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Board isresponsible under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 for the preparation and fair presentation of annual financial statements that comply with Austr alian Accounting Standards - Reduced Disclosure Requirements and the rules made under that Act. The Accountable Authority is also responsible for such internal control as the Accountable Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Accountable Authority is responsible for assessing the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's ability to continue as a going concern, taking into account whether the entity's operations will cease as a result of an administrative restructure or for any other reason. The Accountable Authority is also responsible for disclosing , as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the assessment indicates that it is not appropriate.149 Financial Summary 2017-18 Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assur ance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also: identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control; evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Account able Authority; conclude on the appropriateness of the Accountable Authority's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures ar e inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern; and evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. I communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit.

The GST components arising from investing and financing activities which are recoverable from or payable to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) are classified as operating cash flows.159 Financial Summary 2017-18 2. Explanation of Major Variances between Actual Results and Original Budget Explanations are provided for significant variances between actual results and the original budget, as reflected in the May 2017 Portfolio Budget Statements (PBS) of the ABC. Significant variances are those relevant to the performance of the ABC and are typically those greater than $20,000,000. The budget is not audited. The ABC incurred a comprehensive loss of $71,217,000 for the financial year to June 2018 compared to a comprehensive income of $3,089,000 in the original budget. The primary factors which contributed to this variance include: Investment in Australian content and other content initiatives as mentioned in Note 2F and Note 2B respectively; Recognition of a building maintenance provision of $30,705,000 as detailed in Note 2C; and Other factors including a shortfall in revenue as detailed in Note 2G. A. Timing of original budget The original budget was prepared prior to the completion and approval of the ABC's internal budget by the ABC Board. As a result, the ABC's internal budget may result in amounts being reflected in different line items between the original budget and the actual results at 30 June 2018. B. Investing in Audiences strategy The Managing Director announced the ABC's Investing in Audiences strategy in March 2017 with the aim of allocating resources to encourage innovation and creativity; and address the challenges posed by changing audience demands and declining reach within the context of a fixed government funding envelope. The original budget was prepared having regard for the Investing in Audiences strategy but the detailed execution and implementation of the plan, including significant investment in Australian content and other content initiatives, has resulted in differences between the original budget and the actual results at 30 June 2018. C. Building maintenance - cladding During the year, the ABC undertook an assessment of the cladding used on its buildings for compliance with the current Building Code of Australia (BCA) Fire Safety Standards. The assessment identified the need to carry out certain repairs and modifications to the ABC's existing Ultimo, NSW building. This resulted in a provision (and related expense) amounting to $30,705,000 being recorded in the actual results at 30 June 2018, being the estimated costs to remediate the cladding on the building. This matter was not known at the time the original budget was prepared giving rise to a difference between the original budget and the actual results at 30 June 2018. D. Employee benefits Employee benefits expense is $17,814,000 over the original budget due primarily to investment in specific initiatives as part of the Investing in Audiences Strategy mentioned in Note 2B. In addition, the acceleration of the ABC's Regional Connecting Communities initiative, saw a doubling in the investment and the total roles recruited in 2017-18 compared to the original budget. E. Suppliers Suppliers expense was $33,531,000 over the original budget due primarily to the recognition of the building maintenance provision mentioned in Note 2C and Note 4B as well as costs incurred by the ABC to join the Federal Government whole-of-government purchasing plan, supplier Volume Sourcing Agreement.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2018 160 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 20182. Explanation of Major Variances between Actual Results and Original Budget (continued) F. Program amortisation Television program inventory is amortised in accordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 7B Inventories. Program amortisation is not incurred evenly year on year as it reflects programming schedules and the mix of new and repeat programs, the amortisation rate applicable to the program genre and the value of the program broadcast. Program amortisation was $20,550,000 higher than the original budget for the reasons outlined above, as well as the investment in Australian content. A significant portion of this investment in Australian content was broadcast during the year, resulting in an increase in program amortisation compared to the original budget. G. Sale of goods and rendering of services The original budget includes the budget for both Sale of goods and rendering of services as well as Other revenue while the actual results for the financial year show these amounts separately. The total decrease between the original budget and actual results for these line items is $11,059,000. A general decline in retail sales across the industry and the accelerating market trends towards streaming products (away from the ABC's traditional CD and DVD products) has had a significant impact on revenue during the year. While these factors were known at the time that the original budget was set, this downward trend accelerated at a greater pace than anticipated in the original budget, resulting in the variance. H. Other investments The decrease in Other investments of $70,167,000 against the original budget reflects the additional investment in content and other specific initiatives arising from the Investing in Audiences Strategy, as mentioned in Note 2B, 2D and 2F as well as the decline in ABC Commercial revenue mentioned in Note 2G. This also resulted in Net cash from operating activities being less than the original budget. In addition, the original budget also anticipated the sale of a property during the year, which did not materialise, resulting in lower cash being received and invested during the year. I. Land and buildings The Financial Reporting Rules and Australian Accounting Standards require land and buildings to be recorded at fair value. This requires an annual assessment to be undertaken to ensure that the carrying value of the assets do not differ materially from fair value at 30 June. The original budget could not anticipate nor accurately estimate the impact of the valuation of the ABC's property portfolio at 30 June 2017 nor the impact of the valuation of the ABC's Ultimo site at 30 June 2018, which is the main reason for the increase in the value of Land by $26,132,000. At the same time, the original budget assumed that approximately $25,000,000 in building and fit-out spend associated with the ABC's Southbank Melbourne facility would be incurred in 2017-18. However, much of this spend occurred in 2016-17, was capitalised at 30 June 2017 and depreciated for the full year, which is the main reason for the decrease in Buildings of $19,151,000. J. Infrastructure, plant and equipment Investment in capital projects were paused or put on hold prior to 30 June 2017 with the aim of developing a capital investment strategy that aligned with the ABC's Investing in Audiences Strategy mentioned in Note 2B. The original budget was finalised prior to this decision and assumed capital funds would be spent, similar to previous years. The ABC recently embarked on its technology modernisation program, which will see the implementation of the capital investment strategy over coming years. As a result, spend on projects during the year has been significantly less than planned in the original budget. 161 Financial Summary 2017-18 Due to the reasons above and the continued depreciation of assets over the entire year, the value of Infrastructure, plant and equipmen t is $43,207,000 lower than the original budget. K. Payables The amount owing to Supplier s is directly linked to the level and extent of capital projects in progress. As mentioned in Note 2J, capital projects were paused or put on hold for most of the year. The original budget was finalised prior to this decision and assumed supplier payables would be similar to previous years. The reduction in capital project activity following the pause in projects and the commencement of a few projects late in the financial year, coupled with some large payments made prior to 30 June 2018 has led to Suppliers being $21,697,000 lower than the original budget. The increase in Other payables is due primarily to the accrual of redundancy costs at 30 June 2018, as they were expected to be paid in July 2018, whereas these were included in Employee provisions in the original budget. L. Other provisions The increase in Other provisions is $32,408,000 higher than original budget due primarily to the building maintenance provision mentioned in Note 2C. M. Employee provisions Long-term employee benefits are measured through an independent actuarial valuation. The Financial Reporting Rule requires the use of the Australian Government bond rate as the discount rate. The original budget could not anticipate nor forecast the impact of the valuation of long-term employee benefits and was set based on the most recent actuarial valuation at that time (30 June 2016), when the Australian Government bond rate was 2%. At 30 June 2017, the Australian Government bond rate had increased to 2.6% and has remained at this level at 30 June 2018. This resulted in a reduction in the valuation of employee benefits at 30 June 2017.At the same time, the number of ABC employee numbers with or eligible for long-term employee benefits has reduced significantly over the same period as the organisation is redeploying resources from support towards content creation. As a result of the above and the inclusion of redundancy costs in Other payables , as mentioned in Note 2K, Employee provisions is $31,563,000 lower than the original budget. N. Cash Flow Statement Movements in the Cash Flow Statement including lower than expected total cash received from operating activities are largely reflective of the explanations provided in Note 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 2F, 2G and 2H. In addition, the Cash Flow Statement shows the gross amounts related to the purchase and proceeds of investments separately under investment activities whilst the original budget shows a net figure.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2018 162 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 20183. Accounting Policies Overview The Corporation is a Corporate Commonwealth, not-for-profit entity. Its functions are set out in section 6 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . Those functions are reflected in the statement of purpose in the ABC Corporate Plan 2017-18, which was prepared in accordance with section 35 of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act). The Corporation sets out to achieve one outcome: inform, educate and entertain audiences throughout Australia and overseas through innovative and comprehensive media and related services. The continued existence of the Corporation in its present form and with its present programs is dependent on Government policy and on continued funding by Parliament. Accounting Framework The principal accounting policies adopted in preparing the financial statements of the Corporation are stated to assist in a general understanding of these financial statements. The financial statements for the Corporation for the year ended 30 June 2018 was authorised for issue by the Directors on 10 August 2018. Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements The financial statements are general purpose financial statements as required by section 42 of the PGPA Act. The financial statements and notes have been prepared in accordance with; PGPA (Financial Reporting) Rule 2015 (FRR) for reporting periods ending on or after 1 July 2017; and Australian Accounting Standards - Reduced Disclosure Requirements issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) that apply for the reporting period. The Corporation's financial statements have been prepared on an accrual basis and in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain assets and liabilities which are at fair value. Except where stated, no allowance is made for the effect of changing prices on the results or the financial position. The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars and values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars unless otherwise specified. Unless an alternative treatment is specifically required by an accounting standard or the FRR, income and expenses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when and only when the flow, consumption or loss of economic benefits has occurred and can be reliably measured. Unless an alternative treatment is specifically required by an accounting standard or the FRR, assets and liabilities are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position when and only when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Corporation or a future sacrifice of economic benefits will be required and the amounts of the assets or liabilities can be reliably measured. However, assets and liabilities arising under executory agreements are not recognised unless required by an accounting standard. Certain assets and liabilities which do not qualify for recognition, including operating lease commitments, commitments for capital expenditure and contingent assets and liabilities are disclosed in the notes to these financial statements. Significant Accounting Judgements In the process of applying the accounting policies listed throughout the financial statements and accompanying notes, the Corporation has taken the fair value of freehold land to be the market value of similar locations and the fair value of freehold buildings to be the depreciated replacement cost, as determined by an independent valuer.163 Financial Summary 2017-18 In addition, the Corporation has taken the fair value of infrastructure, plant, equipment and intangibles to be the depreciated cost which is representative of depreciated replacement cost. Significant Accounting Estimates and Assumptions The Corporation has applied estimates and assumptions to the following: Depreciation, as detailed in Note 4C Depreciation and amortisation and Note 7A Land, buildings, infrastructure, plant and equipment and intangibles; Program amortisation, as detailed in Note 4D Program amortisation and Note 7B Inventories; Impairment of non-financial assets, as detailed in Note 4F Write-down and impairment of assets; Valuation of properties, plant and equipment, as detailed in Note 7A Land, buildings, infrastructure, plant and equipment and intangibles; Provision for make good and Provision for building maintenance (cladding), as detailed in Note 10 Other provisions; Provision for long service leave, and Provision for annual leave as detailed in Note 11 Employee provisions; and Provision for redundancy, as detailed in Note 11 Employee provisions. No other accounting assumptions or estimates have been identified that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. New Accounting Standards Adoption of New Australian Accounting Standard Requirements All revised or amending standards that were issued prior to the sign-off date and are applicable to the current reporting period did not have a material effect on the Corporation's financial statements.Future Australian Accounting Standard Requirements The following new standards and amendments to standards were issued by the AASB but are effective for future reporting periods. The impact of adopting these pronouncements on the Corporation's financial statements is outlined below. This will be continually assessed up to the date the standards are formally adopted. AASB 9 Financial Instruments This Standard replaces AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement . It amends the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets and liabilities and the recognition and de-recognition requirements for financial instruments. Changes to hedge accounting align the accounting with risk management objectives. AASB 9 applies allowances for impairment based on expected credit losses, rather than as and when an impairment event occurs. This takes effect for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. Recognition and measurement of financial assets and transition to AASB 9 Financial Instruments AASB 9, to be adopted by the Corporation from 1 July 2018, introduces a single classification and measurement model for financial assets, dependent on both: An entity's business objective for managing financial assets; and The contractual cash-flow characteristics of those financial assets. The impact on the initial recognition and subsequent measurement of the Corporation's financial assets is expected to have a minimal impact on its financial position as the majority of the Corporation's financial assets comprise held-to-maturity investments or cash and cash equivalents. The Corporation will continue to measure its financial assets at amortised cost, based on the following conditions:Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2018 164 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018 New Accounting Standards (continued) AASB 9 Financial Instruments (continued) Recognition and measurement of financial assets and transition to AASB 9 Financial Instruments (continued) Financial assets are held in order to collect contractual cash flows; and Payments comprise solely of principal and interest and occur on the principal outstanding. Impairment of financial assets and transition to AASB 9 Financial Instruments AASB 9 applies the principle of providing for impairment of financial assets based on expected credit losses (ECL) in the future rather than providing for impairment as and when existing debts are deemed to be impaired. This principle also allows for the expectation of credit losses to be adjusted in response to certain factors, for example prevailing or anticipated market conditions. The new impairment model will apply to financial assets measured at amortised cost (as is the case with the ABC) or fair value through other comprehensive income. The impact to the ABC's financial statements will not be material. Hedge accounting and transition to AASB 9 Financial Instruments With respect to derivative financial instruments - the new standard removes the effectiveness threshold, which means that foreign exchange fluctuations that were previously within the effectiveness threshold will be charged against the Statement of Comprehensive Income rather than against the hedging reserve within Equity. The impact of these transactions is small (nil in 2017-18) and the overall impact on the ABC's financial statements will not be material.AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers AASB 15 provides a single principle-based five-step model to be applied to all sales contracts, based on the transfer of control of goods and services to customers. It replaces the separate models for goods, services and construction contracts currently included in AASB 11 Construction Contracts and AASB 118 Revenue . AASB 2016-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Australian Implementation Guidance for Not-for-Profit Entities permits not-for-profit entities to apply this standard for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. Transition to AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers This applies predominantly to transactions made by ABC Commercial. The ABC has reviewed certain ABC Commercial contracts to determine the extent of the impact of AASB 15 on revenue recognition. The ABC expects the changes attributable to the adoption of AASB 15 to have little impact as ABC Commercial already recognises revenue when performance obligations are met. In addition, changes to the disclosure requirements are not expected to be material to the ABC. AASB 16 Leases AASB 16 introduces a single, on-balance sheet lease accounting model for lessees. A lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-value items. Lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard - i.e. lessors continue to classify leases as finance or operating leases. The standard is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. 3. Accounting Policies (continued)165 Financial Summary 2017-18 Transition to AASB 16 Leases The Corporation is undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the potential impact of this standard on its financial position, upon transition and in future years. Particular attention is focused on establishing whether, under the new standard, the Corporation's transmission and distribution contracts would satisfy the criteria to be recognised in the Statement of Financial Position. This work is currently in progress and will help determine the financial impact and the ABC's transition options at 1 July 2019, namely to apply: AASB 16 to all relevant lease contracts in existence at 30 June 2019 and \"grandfather\" certain pre-existing contracts from the requirements of the new standard (\"practical expedient\"); or Full retrospective disclosure, requiring the ABC to restate 30 June 2019 balances in the Statement of Financial Position or modified retrospective approach by which any adjustments only impact equity only at 30 June 2019. Goods and Services Tax (GST) Revenues, gains, expenses and losses are recognised net of the amount of GST except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the revenue or expense. Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of GST included. The net amount of GST receivable from the ATO is included as a financial asset in the Statement of Financial Position while any net amount of GST payable to the ATO is included as a liability in the Statement of Financial Position. Assets are recognised net of the amount of GST except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the ATO. In these circumstances, the GST is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset.Income Tax The Corporation is not subject to income tax pursuant to section 71 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . Two of the Corporation's controlled entities, Music Choice Australia Pty Ltd and The News Channel Pty Limited, while subject to income tax, have been inactive up to and including 30 June 2018. The Corporation's interests in MediaHub Australia Pty Limited, Freeview Australia Limited and National DAB Licence Company Limited are subject to income tax. ABC AustraliaPlus (Shanghai) Cultural Development Co. Ltd, incorporated in the People's Republic of China, is not subject to Australian income tax. Events after Reporting Period There were no material events after the reporting period that would have a material impact on the operations of or finances of the Corporation.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2018 166 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Financial Performance - Expenses 4.

Repairs and maintenance Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals which do not constitute an upgrade or enhancement of equipment are expensed as incurred. Depreciation Depreciable property, infrastructure, plant and equipment assets are depreciated to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the improvements or the unexpired period of the lease. Depreciation rates are initially based on their useful lives, reviewed each year and adjusted as appropriate. Depreciation rates applying to each class of depreciable asset are referenced in Note 7A Land, buildings, infrastructure, plant and equipment and intangibles. Amortisation of intangibles Intangibles comprise software for internal use, broadcast licences and spectrum provided by the Australian Government and are held at fair value. Software is initially recognised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over anticipated useful lives between 3-8 years (2017 3-8 years). The amortised cost is considered to approximate fair value. These assets are assessed annually for potential impairment. Refer to Note 4F Write down and impairment of assets. Broadcast licences and spectrum provided by the Australian Government are held at amortised cost which approximates fair value (refer to Note 7A). Amortisation of produced programs The cost of produced television program inventory is amortised as follows: News, Current Affairs, Live Programs, Factual and Entertainment programs based on current topics - 100% on first screening; Childrens, Education and Movies - straight line over three years from completion of production; iview-only programs - 100% on release; and Programs not covered above - 90% first screening and 10% second screening or after twelve months. The costs of programs produced for Radio are expensed as incurred. Such programs are normally broadcast soon after production, stock on hand at any time being minimal. Amortisation of purchased programs Purchased program inventory is amortised in accordance with the policy noted above or over the rights period of the contract (whichever is lesser). Subsequent sales of residual rights are recognised in the period in which they occur. Refer to Note 7B Inventories regarding inventory valuation.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2018 168 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Notes2018 $'0002017 $'000 4E Finance costs Loans from Department of Finance1,210 1,441 Other finance costs 55 39 Total finance costs 14.2B 1,265 1,480 4F Write-down and impairment of assets Impairment of: Receivables and advances 3,883 1,113 Land and buildings - 61 Infrastructure, plant and equipment- 133 Assets under construction 201 - Inventory held for sale 1,634 98 Other non-fixed assets - (119) Total write-down and impairment of assets 5,718 1,286 4G Net loss from disposal of assets Land and buildings Total proceeds from disposal - (47,000) Carrying value of assets disposed 101 13,500 Cost of disposal (31) 485 Net loss from disposal of land and buildings 70 (33,015) Infrastructure, plant and equipment Total proceeds from disposal (276) (279) Carrying value of assets disposed2,241 600 4.

Write-down and impairment of assets All current and non-current assets are subject to an assessment as to indicators of impairment under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets , with the following exceptions: assets arising from employee benefits; financial assets that are within the scope of AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement ; and non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale in accordance with AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations . Where indications of impairment exist, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated and an impairment adjustment made if the asset's recoverable amount is less than its carrying amount.The recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. Where the future economic benefit of an asset is not primarily dependent on the asset's ability to generate future cash flows, and the asset would be replaced if the Corporation were deprived of the asset, its value in use is taken to be its depreciated replacement cost. At 30 June 2018, the Corporation has assessed whether there are any indications that assets may be impaired.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2018 170 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Gains or losses on disposal of assets Gains or losses from disposal of assets are recognised when control of the asset has passed to the buyer.

Delivery of goods is the performance obligation by which revenue is recognisedNotes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2018 172 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Recognition and measurement (continued) Rendering of services Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion and the meeting of performance obligations of contracts at the reporting date, when; the amount of revenue and transaction costs incurred can be reliably measured; and the probable economic benefits of the transaction will flow to the Corporation. The stage of completion of contracts at the reporting date is determined by reference to the proportion that costs incurred to date bear to the estimated total costs of the transaction. Credit sales are on normal commercial terms. Receivables, which have 30-day terms, are recognised at the nominal amounts due, less any impairment allowance for bad and doubtful debts. The collectability of debts is reviewed at the balance date. Allowances are made when the collectability of debt is no longer probable. Interest revenue Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method and if not received at balance date, is reflected in the Statement of Financial Position as a receivable. Subsidies and grants The Corporation receives grant monies from time to time. Most grant agreements require the Corporation to perform services or provide facilities, or to meet eligibility criteria. Subsidies, grants, sponsorships and donations are recognised on receipt unless paid to the Corporation for a specific purpose where recognition of revenue will be recognised in accordance with the agreement. Foreign currency transactions The Corporation enters into foreign currency hedging arrangements to protect its purchasing power in relation to foreign currency exposures. Revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction or at the hedged rate. All gains and losses are taken to profit or loss with the exception of forward exchange contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges used to hedge highly probable transactions. Gains on cash flow hedges held at balance date are taken to equity.

Own-Source Income (continued)173 Financial Summary 2017-18 Financial Position Recognition and measurement Acquisition of assets Assets are recorded at cost at the time of acquisition except as stated below. The cost of acquisition includes the fair value of assets transferred in exchange and liabilities undertaken. Following initial recognition at cost, property, infrastructure, plant, equipment and intangibles are carried at depreciated replacement cost, which approximates fair value. Assets acquired at no cost, or for nominal consideration, are recognised as assets at their fair value, at acquisition date. Fair value measurement of assets and liabilities The Corporation has adopted the following general policies relating to the determination of fair value of assets and liabilities. The fair value of land is determined by reference to the market value of the land component of ABC property because it is possible to base the fair value on recent sales of comparable sites. The Corporation's valuers detail these reference sites in valuation reports for respective properties. The fair value of buildings, infrastructure, plant, equipment and intangibles is determined by reference to depreciated replacement cost as they are typically specialist in nature, with broadcasting in mind. Generally, the fair value of the Corporation's other financial assets and liabilities is deemed to be their carrying value as it approximates fair value. The fair value of long term loans is the net present value of future discounted cash flows arising. AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level in accordance with the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 - unobservable inputs for an asset or liability. The Corporation does not hold any assets or liabilities measured at fair value that are classified as Level 1 inputs (i.e. with reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities). Assets and liabilities measured at fair value and classified as Level 2 and 3 are detailed in Note 7A. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, financial assets and non-interest bearing financial liabilities (except for derivatives used for hedging) of the Corporation, are measured at amortised cost that approximates their fair value. There have been no recurring fair value measurements transferred between the respective levels for assets and liabilities to 30 June 2018. Foreign currency transactions The Corporation enters into foreign currency hedging arrangements to protect its purchasing power in relation to foreign currency exposures. Revenues and expenditures denominated in foreign currencies are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction or at the hedged rate. All monetary foreign currency balances are converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at balance date. Monetary assets and liabilities of overseas branches and amounts payable to or by the Corporation in foreign currencies are translated into Australian dollars at the applicable exchange rate at balance date.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2018 174 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 20186. Financial Assets Recognition and measurement Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are recognised at their nominal amounts and include: cash on hand; cash in special accounts; and cash at bank and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. These are included in current assets, unless they mature more than 12 months after the Statement of Financial Position date, in which case they are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment. Interest is recognised by applying the effective interest rate. The fair value of these instruments approximates their carrying value. Trade receivables are normally settled within 30 days unless otherwise agreed and are carried at amounts due, less an allowance for impairment. Other receivables Other receivables include forward exchange contracts at fair value through profit and loss of $102,616 (2017 $11,967). Under the fair value measurement hierarchy, these are Level 2 financial instruments as defined earlier under Fair value measurement of assets and liabilities The balance represents estimated future cash flows, based on market forward exchange rates at 30 June 2018 and the forward contract rate, discounted by the observable yield curves of the respective currencies. The above amount reflects a 5.5% average depreciation (2017 5.5%) of the Australian dollar against those currencies for which forward exchange contracts have been taken out, where the market forward rate at 30 June 2018 is lower than the contracted rate. Other investments (held to maturity financial assets) Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity investments in accordance with AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Held-to-maturity investments are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment, with revenue recognised on an effective yield basis. Surplus cash is invested into short term investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are classified as 'other investments' and are due to be settled within 12 months.175 Financial Summary 2017-18 Notes2018 $'0002017 $'000 6A Cash and cash equivalents Cash on hand or on deposit 6,393 4,574 Salary sacrifice funds 451 450 Total cash and cash equivalents 14.2A 6,844 5,024 6B Receivables Goods and services Goods and 4,279 4,021 Total goods and services 14.2A 4,279 4,021 Other receivables Net GST receivable from the Australian Taxation Office4,623 1,634 Forward exchange contracts 14.2A 103 12 Finance lease receivable 14.2A - 106 Other, including receivables attributable to joint operations14.2A 4,943 3,676 Total other receivables 9,669 5,428 Total receivables (gross) 13,948 9,449 Less impairment allowance account Goods and services (76) (18) Total impairment allowance (76) (18) Total receivables (net) 13,872 9,431 Receivables are expected to be recovered in: No more than 12 months 13,432 8,994 More than 12 months 440 437 Total receivables (net) 13,872 9,431 Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2018 176 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Notes2018 $'0002017 $'000 Reconciliation of the impairment allowance account Opening balance (18) (492) Amounts written off - 447 Amounts recovered or reversed 18 27 New doubtful debts recognised in deficit(76) - Closing balance (76) (18) 6C Other investments Term deposits with an original maturity date greater than 90 days167,400 230,300 Total other investments 14.2A 167,400 230,300 Other investments are all due to be settled within 12 months. 6D Accrued revenue Goods and services 6,921 8,216 Interest receivable 445 297 Total accrued revenue 14.2A 7,366 8,513 Accrued revenue expected to be recovered in: No more than 12 months 6,536 7,385 More than 12 months 830 1,128 Total receivables (net) 7,366 8,513 6. Financial Assets (continued)177 Financial Summary 2017-18 Recognition and measurement Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for impairment at the end of each reporting period as outlined below. Financial assets held at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred for loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments held at amortised cost, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The carrying amount is reduced by way of an impairment allowance account. The loss is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.Bad and doubtful debts The Corporation makes a specific provision for debts considered doubtful by conducting a detailed review of material debtors, making an assessment of the likelihood of recovery of those debts and taking into account past bad debts experience. Bad debts are written off when identified. Transition to adoption of AASB 9 Financial Instruments The ABC has estimated the likely impact of AASB 9 on the impairment provision for receivables as at 1 July 2018. The impact is assessed to be minimal.

The fair value of land is determined on the basis of market comparability, using recent sales history for comparable sites as referenced by independent valuers. MMJ Advisory undertook a desktop valuation of the Harris Street, Ultimo site as at 30 June 2018. Consequently, a revaluation increment of $4,300,000 (2017 $57,793,000) for land and an increment of $3,537,121 (2017 $7,900,000) for buildings on freehold land was credited to the asset revaluation reserve and included in \"Changes in asset revaluation reserve\" within Other Comprehensive Income in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, \"Reserves\" within the Statement of Financial Position and \"Net revaluation of land and buildings\" in the Statement of Changes in Equity. Level 3 non-financial assets comprise buildings, infrastructure, plant and equipment and intangibles, with no observable market data for the assets. Given the specialised nature of the Corporation's buildings, valuation is determined with reference to depreciated replacement cost, which is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value. The carrying value of the Corporation's infrastructure, plant, equipment and infrastructure represents its depreciated replacement cost, which is considered to be a reasonable approximation of its fair value. The carrying value of the Corporation's software for internal use represents its amortised replacement cost, which is considered to be a reasonable approximation of its fair value. Broadcast licences and spectrum are held at fair value.Asset recognition threshold Purchases of land, buildings, infrastructure, plant, equipment and intangibles are recognised initially at cost in the Statement of Financial Position. Purchases costing less than $2,000 are expensed in the year of acquisition except where they form part of a project or group of similar items, which are significant in total. Revaluations Land, buildings, infrastructure, plant, equipment and intangibles are carried at fair value. Following initial recognition at cost, infrastructure, plant, equipment and intangibles are carried at depreciated replacement cost, which is considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value. Valuations are conducted with sufficient frequency to ensure that the carrying amounts of assets do not materially vary from the assets' fair values as at the reporting date. The regularity of independent valuations depends upon the volatility of movements in market values for the relevant assets. Revaluation adjustments are made on a class basis. Any revaluation increment is credited to equity under the heading of revaluation reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous revaluation decrement of the same asset class, previously recognised through profit or loss. Revaluation decrements for a class of assets are recognised directly through profit or loss except to the extent that they reverse a previous revaluation increment for that class. Any accumulated depreciation at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the asset restated to the re-valued amount. Impairment of non-current assets The aforementioned classes of assets are subject to an assessment as to indicators of impairment under AASB 136 Impairment of Assets as at 30 June 2018.7.

Inventories not held for resale are valued at the lower of cost, adjusted for any loss in service potential, based on the existence of a current replacement cost that is lower than the original acquisition cost or other subsequent carrying amount. Produced programs Television programs are produced for domestic transmission and include direct salaries and expenses and production overheads allocated on a usage basis to the program. Production overheads not allocated to programs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. External contributions received in respect of co-production of television programs are offset against production costs which are recorded as Inventories in the Statement of Financial Position Write-down of inventory held for distribution When inventories held for distribution are distributed, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense. The amount of any write-down of inventories for loss of service potential, and all losses of inventories are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from a reversal of the circumstances that gave rise to the loss of service potential will be recognised as a reduction in the value of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs. Write-down of retail inventory The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value and all losses of inventory are recognised as an expense in the period the write-down or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of any write-down of inventories arising from an increase in the net realisable value will be recognised as a reduction in the value of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs.7.

The facility is provided on an average variable interest rate to 30 June 2018 of 3.35% (2017 3.27%).MediaHub also entered into a 5-year , $1,100,000 (2017 nil) facility with the ANZ Banking Corporation, repayable with quarterly instalments of $55,000. The facility is provided on an average variable interest rate to 30 June 2018 ranging from 3.35% to 3.5% (2017 nil). The fair value of the loan from the Department of Finance at 30 June 2018 is $50,231,245 (2017 $70,282,849), which approximates its carrying value of $50,000,000 (2017 $70,000,000). Under the fair value measurement hierarchy, this is a Level 2 financial instrument. This has been derived on future cash flows based on timing of contractual borrowing costs and the principal repayment, discounted by the Australian Government bond rate for a bond of equivalent duration. The discount rate applied to the cash flow forecasts and the principal values of each drawdown were the Australian Government 2 year bond rate, 2.00% (2017 1.78%) and the Australian Government 3 year , 2.07% (2017 1.94%) respectively.185 $'000 10A Other provisions Make good 3,317 2,487 Building maintenance 30,705 - Total other provisions 34,022 2,487 Other provisions are expected to be settled in: No more than 12 months 31,817 1,044 More than 12 months 2,205 1,443 Total other provisions 34,022 2,487 Reconciliation of the make good provision Opening balance 1,614 New/additional amounts provided830 873 Closing balance 3,317 2,487 Reconciliation of the Building maintenance provision Opening balance - - New amounts provided 30,705 - Closing balance 30,705 - Recognition and measurement Other provisions Provisions are recognised when the Corporation has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, where it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The provision for make good represents the estimated cost to make good 27 (2017: 26) leased properties at the end of the lease term. The estimated cost is based on management's best estimate of the average cost to make good each site, plus an allowance for inflation. During the year, the ABC undertook an assessment of the cladding used on its buildings for compliance with the current BCA Fire Safety Standards. The assessment identified the need to carry out certain repairs and modifications to the ABC's existing Ultimo, NSW building. This resulted in a provision (and related expense) amounting to $30,705,000 being recorded in the actual results at 30 June 2018, being the estimated costs to remediate the cladding on the building.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2018 186 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018People and Relationships 11. Employee Provisions 2018 $'0002017 $'000 11A Employee provisions provisions 134,670 144,026 Employee provisions are expected to be settled in: No more than 12 months 120,624 130,366 More than 12 months 14,046 13,660 Total employee provisions 134,670 144,026 (a) Settlement of employee provisions is based on the individual employee's entitlement to leave. Where an employee has a current entitlement to leave (i.e. could apply to take that leave straight away), the value of that entitlement is included in the employee provisions expected to settle in no more than 12 months. Where the Corporation expects that an employee will eventually meet an entitlement for leave (i.e. at some time in the future), but is not yet entitled to that leave, the value of the leave is included in the employee provision expected to settle in more than 12 months.Recognition and measurement Employee provisions Liabilities for short-term employee benefits and termination benefits expected within twelve months of the end of reporting period are measured at their nominal amounts. Other long-term employee benefits are measured as the net total of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period minus the fair value at the end of the reporting period of plan assets (if any) out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Leave Leave liabilities are calculated on the basis of employees' remuneration at the estimated salary rates that will apply at the time the leave is taken, including the employer superannuation contribution rates to the extent that the leave is likely to be taken during service rather than paid out on termination. The calculation is based on the anticipated length of time taken for an employee to fully settle his/her leave entitlement. The liability for long service leave has been determined by reference to the work of an actuary, PricewaterhouseCoopers Securities Ltd. The liability for long service leave is the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by the Corporation resulting from employees' services provided up to 30 June 2018. The estimate of the present value of the liability takes into account attrition rates and pay increases through promotion and inflation. Redundancy A provision exists for those employees who will be made redundant in future periods and either had a reasonable expectation of being made redundant, or for which Management had begun to execute a formal plan, which created a valid expectation of redundancy amongst affected staff, at 30 June 2018.187 Financial Summary 2017-18 Superannuation Employees are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS), the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan Scheme (PSSap) or another non-Commonwealth Superannuation fund. The CSS and PSS are defined benefit schemes for the Australian Government. The PSSap and other non-Commonwealth funds are defined contribution schemes. The liability for defined benefits is recognised in the financial statements of the Australian Government and is settled by the Australian Government in due course. This liability is reported in the Department of Finance's administered schedules and notes.The Corporation makes employer contributions to the employee defined benefit superannuation schemes at rates determined by an actuary to be sufficient to meet the current cost to the Government of the superannuation entitlements of the Corporation's employees. The Corporation accounts for the contributions in the same manner as contributions to defined contribution plans. The liability for superannuation recognised as at 30 June 2018 represents outstanding contributions at the end of the period. Expenses Expenses attributable to the aforementioned employee benefits and provisions are reported in Note 4A Employee benefits. 12. Key Management Personnel Remuneration Key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or otherwise) of the Corporation.

The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Financial assets are recognised and derecognised upon trade date. Effective Interest Method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period. Income is recognised on an effective interest rate basis except for financial assets that are recognised at fair value through profit or loss.Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) where the financial assets: have been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future; are derivatives (except for derivative instruments that are designated as, and are highly effective hedging instruments); or are parts of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Corporation manages together and have a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking. Forward exchange contracts in this category are classified as current assets. Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset. The Corporation's financial assets in this category are forward exchange contracts which are derivative financial instruments. Gains and losses on these items are recognised through profit or loss except if they are classified as a cash flow hedge where they are recognised in the hedging reserve within equity.14.

Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contracts are entered into and are subsequently revalued to reflect changes in fair value. Forward exchange contracts are carried as assets when their net fair value is positive and as liabilities when their net fair value is negative. For the purpose of hedge accounting, the Corporation's hedges are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable either to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset, liability or to a highly probable forecast transaction. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Corporation formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Corporation wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Corporation will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flow attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the cash flow hedge is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when hedged income or expenses are recognised or when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to profit or loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain until the forecast transaction occurs. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to profit or loss. 14.3 Financial Risk Management The Corporation's financial risk management policies and procedures are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Corporation, to set appropriate risk limits and controls to monitor risks and adherence to limits. The Corporation's policies are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in the Corporation's activities. There has been no change in the policies from the previous year. Compliance with policies and exposure limits are reviewed by the Corporation's internal auditors on a regular basis. To meet the Corporation's regular financial risk management objectives, surplus cash is invested in short term, highly liquid investments with maturities at acquisition date of greater than three months. These investments are included as 'other receivables'. The Corporation's Treasury function provides advice and services to the business, coordinates access to foreign currency contracts and 14. Financial Instruments (continued) Recognition and measurement (continued) Financial Instruments (continued)197 Financial Summary 2017-18 monitors and assesses the financial risks relating to the operations of the Corporation through internal risk reports. Where appropriate, the Corporation seeks to minimise the effects of its financial risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Corporation's policies, approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and investment of funds. The Corporation does not enter into trade financial instruments for speculative purposes. Under Section 25B of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 , the Corporation's Foreign Exchange Policy is conducted in order to reduce or eliminate risk on the Corporation's known exposures and activities and will be recorded under accepted accounting standards. The Corporation's aims, by entering into foreign currency hedging arrangements are outlined in Note 4 Expenses and the Financial Position section under \" Foreign currency transactions \". 14.4 Fair Values of Financial Instruments Forward exchange contracts The fair value of forward exchange contracts is taken to be the unrealised gain or loss at balance date calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. At 30 June 2018 this was a net receivable of $86,503 (2017 net liability of $259,622). The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (such as over-the-counter derivatives) are determined using a Level 2 technique based on the forward exchange rates at the end of the reporting period using assumptions that are based on market conditions at the end of each reporting period. Loans The fair values of long-term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on current interest rates for liabilities with similar risk profiles. At 30 June 2018, the Corporation's loan facility with the Department of Finance is $50,000,000 (2017 $70,000,000) and progressively matures by 8 April 2021. This is to cash-flow the construction of a purpose-built facility in Southbank, Victoria. The Corporation repaid $20,000,000 during the year ended 30 June 2018 (2017 $20,000,000). As disclosed in Note 9 Interest Bearing Liabilities, the fair value of the loan at 30 June 2018 is $50,231,245 (2017 $70,282,849). 14.5 Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Corporation. Credit risk arises from the financial assets of the Corporation, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, short term investments and derivative instruments. The Corporation has a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Corporation assesses credit ratings through independent ratings agencies and if not available, uses publicly available financial information and its own trading record to rate customers. The Corporation manages its credit risk by undertaking credit checks on customers who wish to take on credit terms. The Corporation has policies that set limits for each individual customer. Ongoing credit evaluations are performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable. The Corporation has no material concentration of credit risk with any single customer as the Corporation has a large number of customers spread across a range of industries and geographical areas. The credit risk arising from dealings in financial instruments is controlled by a strict policy of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors. The Corporation does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty. The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with credit ratings of at least A- as assigned by Standard & Poor's.Notes to and Forming Part of the Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2018 198 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018The Corporation's maximum exposure to credit risk at reporting date in relation to each class of recognised financial assets is the carrying amount, net of allowance for doubtful debts, of those assets as indicated in the Statement of Financial Position. Credit exposure of foreign currency and interest rate bearing investments is represented by the net fair value of the contracts.

Specific hedges The Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments when exposures of $50,000 or greater are entered into under a firm contract for goods or services involving a specific foreign currency amount and payment date. Exposures are covered if they fall within a set period, which can generally be a minimum of 3 months or maximum of 6 months subject to market conditions. A net loss of $2,083 (2017 net loss of $77,667) on specific hedges of foreign currency purchases, outstanding as at 30 June 2018, was recorded. The Corporation's cash flow hedges were all effective during the period.General hedges The Corporation enters into forward exchange contracts to cover foreign currency payments when exposures less than $50,000, of a recurrent nature and with varying foreign currency amounts and payment dates are incurred. General cover is typically held between 20% and 80% of estimated exposures for USD, GBP and EUR subject to market conditions. At balance date, the Corporation held forward exchange contracts to buy USD, GBP and EUR. Gains/losses arising from general hedges outstanding at year end have been taken to profit or loss. The net gain is $96,486 (2017 net loss of $13,925) on general hedges of anticipated foreign currency purchases, outstanding as at 30 June 2018.14.

The Committee received papers relating to ABC strategic risks, risk management, business resilience, security, procurement and material contracts. The Committee also received financial management reports and considered the matters related to the preparation and finalisation of the Annual Financial Statements. 207 Appendices Risk & Audit Committee From 8 February 2018, following a review of group governance, the Audit Risk & Finance Committee was renamed as the Risk & Audit Committee, with the focus on risk management and audit practices. Importantly, there was a change to the scope of the financial responsibilities with some activities previously delegated to the Committee now being performed at Board level. The Risk & Audit Committee continues to perform its critical role of overseeing the preparation of the annual financial statements and annual performance statements, and the integrity of those processes. Risk & Audit Committee responsibilities are detailed in the Charter approved by the ABC Board on 8 February 2018 and include: Financial reporting; Performance reporting; Risk management / System of oversight and management; System of internal control; External audit; and Internal audit.

People & Remuneration Committee (formerly People Committee) The People Committee was established by the ABC Board in February 2017, and following a review of group governance in early 2018, was renamed as the People & Remuneration Committee on 8 February 2018. An updated Charter was approved by the ABC Board at that time. The purpose of the People & Remuneration Committee is to assist the Board to fulfil its duties and responsibilities as set out in the ABC Act focusing on: Remuneration policies and practices; Key performance indicators (KPIs) and performance; People strategy, culture and engagement; Succession planning and talent development; Equity and diversity strategy and reporting; and Work health and safety.208 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018The People & Remuneration Committee held four meetings in 2017-18.

Prohibited content essentially involves content that is classified either as RC (Refused Classification) or X18+. This includes real depictions of actual sexual activity, child pornography, detailed instruction in crime, violence or drug use; and age-restricted content. 2. Age-restricted content involves content classified as R18+ or MA15+ that is delivered through a mobile device or through a service that provides audio or video content for a fee. This type of content must be subject to a restricted access system, i.e. measures put in place to protect children under the age of 15 from exposure to unsuitable material. This category of content includes material containing strong depictions of nudity, implied sexual activity, drug use or violence, very frequent or very strong coarse language, and other material that is strong in impact. I. Regulatory Framework The ABC Board is required, under section 8(1) (e) of the ABC Act, to develop a code of practice relating to its television and radio programming, and to notify this code to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (\"the ACMA\"). A complaint alleging the ABC has acted contrary to its Code of Practice in its television or radio programming may be made to the ABC. A complainant is entitled under section 150 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth) (\"the BSA\") to take their complaint to the ACMA if, after 60 days, the ABC fails to respond to the complainant or the complainant considers the ABC's response is inadequate. Section 150 of the BSA empowers the ACMA to investigate a complaint alleging the ABC has, in providing a national broadcasting service, breached its Code of Practice. The ACMA can decline to investigate the complaint under section 151 of the BSA if it is satisfied that the complaint does not relate to the ABC Code of Practice, or that the complaint is frivolous or vexatious or was not made in good faith. The ACMA's jurisdiction under sections 150-151 does not encompass the ABC's print content or content disseminated by the ABC over the internet or through mobile devices. However, the ACMA has separate jurisdiction under Schedule 7 of the BSA in relation to content hosted on websites or transmitted through mobile services where that content is either \"prohibited content\" 1 or \"age-restricted content\".2 The ACMA is empowered under Schedule 7 to require content service providers and content hosts to remove or prevent access to these types of content. The ABC voluntarily complies with the Content Services Code developed by the Internet Industry Association and registered as an industry code with the ACMA under clause 85 of Schedule 7 of the BSA. The Content Services Code does not apply to content delivered through online or mobile services where that content has been previously transmitted on radio or television. Except as expressly provided by the BSA, the regulatory regime established by the BSA does not apply to the ABC: section 13(5) of the BSA, and section 79 of the ABC Act. II. Scope of the Code The requirements of this Code are set out in the sections dealing with Interpretation and Standards in Part IV and the Associated Standard in Part V. The Standards in Part IV apply to radio and television programs broadcast by the ABC on its free-to-air television or radio broadcasting services. The Associated Standard in Part V applies only to television programs broadcast by the ABC on its domestic free-to-air television services. This Code does not apply to any complaint which the ABC had decided not to investigate or, having accepted it for investigation, decided not to investigate further, where the ABC was satisfied that: the complaint concerns content which is or becomes the subject of legal proceedings; the complaint was frivolous or vexatious or not made in good faith; the complaint was lodged with the ABC more than six weeks after the date when the program was last broadcast by the ABC on its free-to-air radio or television services, unless the ABC accepted the complaint for investigation after being satisfied that it was appropriate to do so, having regard to: -the interests of the complainant in the subject matter of the complaint; -the seriousness of the alleged breach; -the reason(s) for the delay; -the availability of the program content which is the subject of the complaint; and 211 Appendices -any prejudice the delay may otherwise have on the ABC's ability to investigate and determine the matter fairly; or -the complainant does not have a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the complaint, where the complaint alleges a breach of Fair and honest dealing (Standards 5.1-5.8) or Privacy (Standard 6.1). To avoid any doubt, the ABC intends that any complaint falling within the terms of any one of the above categories is not relevant to the ABC Code of Practice, for the purposes of section 151(2)(b) of the BSA. In effect, this means that only complaints which the ABC has accepted for investigation in accordance with the above criteria are eligible under this Code to be reviewed and investigated by the ACMA. III. Resolved Complaints The ABC seeks to comply fully with the Code and to resolve complaints as soon as practicable. A failure to comply will not be a breach of the Code if the ABC has, prior to the complaint being made to the ACMA, taken steps which were adequate and appropriate in all the circumstances to redress the cause of the complaint. To illustrate, a failure to comply with Standards 2.1 or 2.2 (Accuracy) will not be taken to be a breach of the Code if a correction or clarification, which is adequate and appropriate in all the circumstances, is made prior to or within 30 days of the ABC receiving the complaint. IV. Principles and Standards 1. Interpretation In this Code, the Standards must be interpreted and applied in accordance with the Principles applying in each Section. From time to time, the ABC publishes Guidance Notes which do not in themselves impose obligations on the ABC, but which may be relevant in interpreting and applying the Code. The Standards in Parts IV and V are to be interpreted and applied with due regard for the nature of the content under consideration in particular cases. The ABC is conscious that its dual obligations\u2014for accountability and for high quality\u2014can in practice interact in complex ways. It can be a sign of strength not weakness that journalism enrages or art shocks. The Standards are to be applied in ways that maintain independence and integrity, preserve trust and do not unduly constrain journalistic enquiry or artistic expression. 2. Accuracy Principles: The ABC has a statutory duty to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Credibility depends heavily on factual accuracy. Types of fact-based content include news and analysis of current events, documentaries, factual dramas and lifestyle programs. The ABC requires that reasonable efforts must be made to ensure accuracy in all fact-based content. The ABC gauges those efforts by reference to: the type, subject and nature of the content; the likely audience expectations of the content; the likely impact of reliance by the audience on the accuracy of the content; and the circumstances in which the content was made and presented. The ABC accuracy standard applies to assertions of fact, not to expressions of opinion. An opinion, being a value judgement or conclusion, cannot be found to be accurate or inaccurate in the way facts can. The accuracy standard requires that opinions be conveyed accurately, in the sense that quotes should be accurate and any editing should not distort the meaning of the opinion expressed. The efforts reasonably required to ensure accuracy will depend on the circumstances. Sources with relevant expertise may be relied on more heavily than those without. Eyewitness testimony usually carries more weight than second-hand accounts. The passage of time or the inaccessibility of locations or sources can affect the standard of verification reasonably required. The ABC should make reasonable efforts, appropriate in the context, to signal to audiences 212 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018gradations in accuracy, for example by querying interviewees, qualifying bald assertions, supplementing the partly right and correcting the plainly wrong. Standards: 2.1 Make reasonable efforts to ensure that material facts are accurate and presented in context. 2.2 Do not present factual content in a way that will materially mislead the audience. In some cases, this may require appropriate labels or other explanatory information. 3. Corrections and clarifications Principles: A commitment to accuracy includes a willingness to correct errors and clarify ambiguous or otherwise misleading information. Swift correction can reduce harmful reliance on inaccurate information, especially given content can be quickly, widely and permanently disseminated. Corrections and clarifications can contribute to achieving fairness and impartiality. Standards: 3.1 Acknowledge and correct or clarify, in an appropriate manner as soon as reasonably practicable: a. significant material errors that are readily apparent or have been demonstrated; or b. information that is likely to significantly and materially mislead. 4. Impartiality and diversity of perspectives Principles: The ABC has a statutory duty to ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is impartial according to the recognised standards of objective journalism. Aiming to equip audiences to make up their own minds is consistent with the public service character of the ABC. A democratic society depends on diverse sources of reliable information and contending opinions. A broadcaster operating under statute with public funds is legitimately expected to contribute in ways that may differ from commercial media, which are free to be partial to private interests. Judgements about whether impartiality was achieved in any given circumstances can vary among individuals according to their personal and subjective view of any given matter of contention. Acknowledging this fact of life does not change the ABC's obligation to apply its impartiality standard as objectively as possible. In doing so, the ABC is guided by these hallmarks of impartiality: a balance that follows the weight of evidence; fair treatment; open-mindedness; and opportunities over time for principal relevant perspectives on matters of contention to be expressed. The ABC aims to present, over time, content that addresses a broad range of subjects from a diversity of perspectives reflecting a diversity of experiences, presented in a diversity of ways from a diversity of sources, including content created by ABC staff, generated by audiences and commissioned or acquired from external content-makers. Impartiality does not require that every perspective receives equal time, nor that every facet of every argument is presented. Assessing the impartiality due in given circumstances requires consideration in context of all relevant factors including: the type, subject and nature of the content; the circumstances in which the content is made and presented; the likely audience expectations of the content; the degree to which the matter to which the content relates is contentious; the range of principal relevant perspectives on the matter of contention; and the timeframe within which it would be appropriate for the ABC to provide opportunities for the principal relevant perspectives to be expressed, having regard to the public importance of the matter of contention and the extent to which it is the subject of current debate. 213 Appendices Standards: 4.1 Gather and present news and information with due impartiality. 4.2 Present a diversity of perspectives so that, over time, no significant strand of thought or belief within the community is knowingly excluded or disproportionately represented. 4.3 Do not state or imply that any perspective is the editorial opinion of the ABC. The ABC takes no editorial stance other than its commitment to fundamental democratic principles including the rule of law, freedom of speech and religion, parliamentary democracy and equality of opportunity. 4.4 Do not misrepresent any perspective. 4.5 Do not unduly favour one perspective over another. 5. Fair and honest dealing Principles: Fair and honest dealing is essential to maintaining trust with audiences and with those who participate in or are otherwise directly affected by ABC content. In rare circumstances, deception or a breach of an undertaking may be justified. Because of the potential damage to trust, deception or breach of an undertaking must be explained openly afterwards unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. Standards: Dealing with participants 5.1 Participants in ABC content should normally be informed of the general nature of their participation. 5.2 A refusal to participate will not be overridden without good cause. Opportunity to respond 5.3 Where allegations are made about a person or organisation, make reasonable efforts in the circumstances to provide a fair opportunity to respond. Attribution and sources 5.4 Aim to attribute information to its source. 5.5 Where a source seeks anonymity, do not agree without first considering the source's motive and any alternative attributable sources. 5.6 Do not misrepresent another's work as your own. Undertakings 5.7 Assurances given in relation to conditions of participation, use of content, confidentiality or anonymity must be honoured except in rare cases where justified in the public interest. Secret recording and other types of deception 5.8 Secret recording devices, misrepresentation or other types of deception must not be used to obtain or seek information, audio, pictures or an agreement to participate except where: a. justified in the public interest and the material cannot reasonably be obtained by any other means; or b. consent is obtained from the subject or identities are effectively obscured; or c. the deception is integral to an artistic work and the potential for harm is taken into consideration. 6. Privacy Principles: Privacy is necessary to human dignity and every person reasonably expects that their privacy will be respected. But privacy is not absolute. The ABC seeks to balance the public interest in respect for privacy with the public interest in disclosure of information and freedom of expression. Standards: 6.1 Intrusion into a person's private life without consent must be justified in the public interest and the extent of the intrusion must be limited to what is proportionate in the circumstances. 214 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 20187. Harm and offence Principles: The ABC broadcasts comprehensive and innovative content that aims to inform, entertain and educate diverse audiences. This involves a willingness to take risks, invent and experiment with new ideas. It can result in challenging content which may offend some of the audience some of the time. But it also contributes to diversity of content in the media and to fulfilling the ABC's function to encourage and promote the musical, dramatic and other performing arts. The ABC acknowledges that a public broadcaster should never gratuitously harm or offend and accordingly any content which is likely to harm or offend must have a clear editorial purpose. The ABC potentially reaches the whole community, so it must take into account community standards. However, the community recognises that what is and is not acceptable in ABC content largely depends upon the particular context, including the nature of the content, its target audience, and any signposting that equips audiences to make informed choices about what they see, hear or read. Applying the harm and offence standard, therefore, requires careful judgement. What may be inappropriate and unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. Coarse language, disturbing images or unconventional situations may form a legitimate part of reportage, debate, documentaries or a humorous, satirical, dramatic or other artistic work. Standards: 7.1 Content that is likely to cause harm or offence must be justified by the editorial context. 7.2 Where content is likely to cause harm or offence, having regard to the context, make reasonable efforts to provide information about the nature of the content with classification labels or other warnings or advice. 7.3 Ensure all domestic television programs - apart from news, current affairs and sporting events - are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. 7.4 If inadvertent or unexpected actions, audio or images in live content are likely to cause harm or offence, take appropriate steps to mitigate. 7.5 The reporting or depiction of violence, tragedy or trauma must be handled with extreme sensitivity. Avoid causing undue distress to victims, witnesses or bereaved relatives. Be sensitive to significant cultural practices when depicting or reporting on recently deceased persons. 7.6 Where there is editorial justification for content which may lead to dangerous imitation or exacerbate serious threats to individual or public health, safety or welfare, take appropriate steps to mitigate those risks, particularly by taking care with how content is expressed or presented. 7.7 Avoid the unjustified use of stereotypes or discriminatory content that could reasonably be interpreted as condoning or encouraging prejudice. 8. Children and young people Principles: The ABC aims to provide children and young people (under the age of 18) with enjoyable and enriching content, as well as opportunities for them to express themselves. Children and young people participate and interact with the ABC in various ways\u2014as actors, presenters, interviewees, subjects, content makers and audience members. The ABC has a responsibility to protect children and young people from potential harm that might arise during their engagement with the ABC and its content. The ABC shares this responsibility with parents/guardians and with the child or young person him/herself. In particular, the ABC recommends that parents/guardians supervise children and young people's access to content, their participation in interactive services, and their exposure to news and current affairs. It is not always possible to avoid presenting content that may be distressing to some audience members. Standards: 8.1 Take due care over the dignity and physical and emotional welfare of children and 215 Appendices young people who are involved in making, participating in and presenting content produced or commissioned by the ABC. 8.2 Before significant participation of a child or young person in content produced or commissioned by the ABC, or in interactive services offered by the ABC, consider whether it is appropriate to obtain the consent of both the child/young person and the parent/guardian. 8.3 Adopt appropriate measures wherever practicable to enable children and young people, or those who supervise them, to manage risks associated with the child/young person's participation with, use of and exposure to ABC content and services designed for them. 8.4 Take particular care to minimise risks of exposure to unsuitable content or inappropriate contact by peers or strangers. V. Associated Standard: Television Program Classification Status of Associated Standard This Associated Standard is approved by the ABC Board and is binding. It is for consideration by relevant editorial decision-makers when providing advice on compliance and by complaints bodies when dealing with complaints. The Associated Standard is provided to assist interpretation of or otherwise supplement the standard in the Editorial Policies to which the Associated Standard relates. This Associated Standard forms part of the Code of Practice notified to the Australian Communications and Media Authority under section 8(1)(e) of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 . Key Editorial Standard 7.3 Ensure all domestic television programs - with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events - are classified and scheduled for broadcast in accordance with the ABC's Associated Standard on Television Program Classification. Principles: The ABC applies the classifications listed below to the broadcast of all its domestic television programs with the exception of news, current affairs and sporting events. The ABC classifications are adapted from the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games issued by the Classification Board made under the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. The guiding principle in the application of the following classifications is context. What is inappropriate and unacceptable in one context may be appropriate and acceptable in another. Factors to be taken into account include: the artistic or educational merit of the production, the purpose of a sequence, the tone, the camera work, the intensity and relevance of the material, the treatment, and the intended audience. Standards: 7.3.1 Television Classifications G - GENERAL G programs may be shown at any time. G programs, which include programs designed for pre-school and school-aged children, are suitable for children to watch on their own. Some G programs may be more appropriate for older children. The G classification does not necessarily indicate that the program is one that children will enjoy. Some G programs contain themes or storylines that are not of interest to children. Whether or not the program is intended for children, the treatment of themes and other classifiable elements will be careful and discreet. Themes: The treatment of themes should be discreet, justified by context, and very mild in impact. The presentation of dangerous, imitable behaviour is not permitted except in those circumstances where it is justified by context. Any depiction of such behaviour must not encourage dangerous imitation. Violence: Violence may be very discreetly implied, but should: have a light tone, or have a very low sense of threat or menace, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Sex: Sexual activity should: 216 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018 only be suggested in very discreet visual or verbal references, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Artistic or cultural depictions of nudity in a sexual context may be permitted if the treatment is discreet, justified by context, and very mild in impact. Language: Coarse language should: be very mild and infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: The depiction of the use of legal drugs should be handled with care. Illegal drug use should be implied only very discreetly and be justified by context. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should be: infrequent, and not detailed, and not gratuitous. PG - PARENTAL GUIDANCE (Parental Guidance recommended for people under 15 years) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, PG programs may be shown in accordance with Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. PG programs may contain themes and concepts which, when viewed by those under 15 years, may require the guidance of an adult. The PG classification signals to parents that material in this category contains depictions or references which could be confusing or upsetting to children without adult guidance. Material classified PG will not be harmful or disturbing to children. Parents may choose to preview the material for their children. Some may choose to watch the material with their children. Others might find it sufficient to be accessible during or after the viewing to discuss the content. Themes: The treatment of themes should be discreet and mild in impact. More disturbing themes are not generally dealt with at PG level. Supernatural or mild horror themes may be included. Violence: Violence may be discreetly implied or stylised and should also be: mild in impact, and not shown in detail. Sex: Sexual activity and nudity in a sexual context may be suggested, but should: be discreet, and be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Verbal references to sexual activity should be discreet. Language: Coarse language should be mild and infrequent. Drug Use: Discreet verbal references and mild, incidental visuals of drug use may be included, but these should not promote or encourage drug use. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context should not be detailed or gratuitous. M - MATURE (Recommended for people aged 15 years and over) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, M programs may be shown in accordance with the Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. The M category is recommended for people aged over 15 years. Programs classified M contain material that is considered to be potentially harmful or disturbing to those under 15 years. Depictions and references to classifiable elements may contain detail. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the M category\u2014the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification and the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification. Themes: Most themes can be dealt with, but the treatment should be discreet and the impact should not be strong. Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should: not contain a lot of detail, and not be prolonged. In realistic treatments, depictions of violence that contain detail should: be infrequent, and 217 Appendices not have a strong impact, and not be gratuitous. In stylised treatments, depictions of violence may contain more detail and be more frequent if this does not increase the impact. Verbal and visual references to sexual violence may only be included if they are: discreet and infrequent, and strongly justified by the narrative or documentary context. Sex: Sexual activity may be discreetly implied. Nudity in a sexual context should not contain a lot of detail, or be prolonged. Verbal references to sexual activity may be more detailed than depictions if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Generally, coarse language that is stronger, detailed or very aggressive should: be infrequent, and not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be discreetly shown. Drug use should not be promoted or encouraged. Nudity: Nudity outside of a sexual context may be shown but depictions that contain any detail should not be gratuitous. MA15+ - MATURE AUDIENCE (Not suitable for people under 15 years) Subject to the Implementation Guidelines at 7.3.2, MA15+ programs may be shown in accordance with the Time Zone Charts at 7.3.5. MA15+ programs, because of the matter they contain or because of the way it is treated, are not suitable for people aged under 15 years. Material classified MA15+ deals with issues or contains depictions which require a more mature perspective. This is because the impact of individual elements or a combination of elements is considered likely to be harmful or disturbing to viewers under 15 years of age. While most themes may be dealt with, the degree of explicitness and intensity of treatment will determine what can be accommodated in the MA15+ category---the more explicit or more intense material, especially violent material, will be included in the MA15+ classification and the less explicit or less intense material will be included in the M classification. Themes: The treatment of themes with a high degree of intensity should not be gratuitous. Violence: Generally, depictions of violence should not have a high impact. In realistic treatments, detailed depictions of violence with a strong impact should: be infrequent, and not be prolonged, and not be gratuitous. Depictions of violence in stylised treatments may be more detailed and more frequent if this does not increase the impact. Depictions of sexual violence are permitted only if they are not frequent, prolonged, gratuitous or exploitative. Sex: Sexual activity may be implied. Depictions of nudity in a sexual context which contain detail should not be exploitative. Verbal references may be more detailed than depictions, if this does not increase the impact. Language: Coarse language may be used. Coarse language that is very strong, aggressive or detailed should not be gratuitous. Drug Use: Drug use may be shown, but should not be promoted or encouraged. More detailed depictions should not have a high degree of impact. Nudity: Nudity should be justified by context. 7.3.2 Implementation Guidelines The time zones for each program classification are guides to the most likely placement of programs within that classification. They are not hard and fast rules and there will be occasions on which programs or segments of programs appear in other time zones. There must be sound reasons for any departure from the time zone for a program classification. Possible reasons might include, for example, the need to schedule programs which are serious presentations of moral, social or cultural issues in timeslots most suitable for their target audiences.218 AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION ANNUAL REPORT 2018Programs, including those having a particular classification under the Classification Board's Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games, may be modified so that they are suitable for broadcast or suitable for broadcast at particular times. Broken Hill in New South Wales shares a time zone with South Australia but ordinarily receives the ABC's New South Wales TV services. Given the time zone difference, some programs are broadcast outside their classification time zone. 7.3.3 Television Classification Symbols The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being shown will be displayed at the beginning of the program. The classification symbol of the PG, M or MA15+ program (except for news, current affairs or sporting events) being promoted will be displayed during the promotion. 7.3.4 Consumer Advice Audio and visual consumer advice on the reasons for an M or MA15+ classification will be given prior to the beginning of an M or MA15+ program.ABC main channel 7.30pm 8.30pm 9pm 5am is not on air at PG Mthis time) MA 9pm 5am G (ABC KIDS is not on PG M air at this time) MA ABC ME 5am 12pm Appendix 5 - Television Content Analysis ABC main channel linear program hours transmitted - 24 hours Australian Overseas Total First ReleaseRepeatTotal AustralianFirst ReleaseRepeatTotal Overseas2017-18 2016-17 Arts and Culture19 88 106 0 18 18 124 176 Children's 1 7 8 0 0 0 8 15 Current Affairs 644 390 1,035 1 0 1 1,035 1,185 Documentary 27 162 189 45 220 264 453 530 Drama 73 257 331 96 1,259 1,356 1,686 27 348 374 2,116 2,204 Factual 79 220 299 6 658 664 963 748 Indigenous 0 11 11 0 0 0 11 20 Movies 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 25 News 1,734 135 1,869 0 0 0 1,869 1,871 Religion and Ethics18 29 47 2 24 26 73 74 Sport 15 43 58 0 66 66 125 154 Total Program Hours4,042 1,653 5,695 177 Hours 68% 32% *Other: includes interstitial material, program announcements and community service announcements.
