We're not hanging on; instead, we're leading the charge. 1 NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF NATURAL MEDICINE 1 Board of Directors 3 Letter from the President & Board Chair 5 Our Campus 7 Program Development 9 Community Engagement 12 Financial Statements 16 Partners Program 17 Donors 3 NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF NATURAL MEDICINE We have just finished year sixty-one and year one, both at the same time. We started off in 1956 as National College of Naturopathic Medicine. And now after our first full year as a university, we can look back and celebrate that we stayed the course\u2014rebranding our venerable institution, building on our signature presence in natural medicine as the mothership, not only of naturopathic medicine in North America, but also as the anchoring school of classical Chinese medicine. The terrain of higher education and health care is transforming at a fair clip. We're not hanging on; instead, we're leading the charge. The planned growth of our program mix is in full stride. Our students know they've made the right choice. We're closing in on the baker's dozen mark of programs. Our first cohort of undergraduate students is strong and stable. Our graduate programs are well received and flourishing. And we're moving ahead with plans for more, much more.We are continuing to deepen our reach beyond the classroom and clinic. Our Institutes are expanding offerings not only in the general community, but also in the professional areas they serve. The Food As Medicine Institute, for example, is in the home stretch of development of a remarkable new partnership with Saint Luke's Hospital in Kansas. Closer to home, its community FAME classes at Charlee's Kitchen continue to draw excited participants and the classes at Coffee Creek Correctional Center are thriving, with waiting lists of participants. Then there are the Traditional Roots, Age Wise and Women in Balance Institutes\u2014incubators, providers and catalysts for health-related education and services that proffer the NUNM brand strongly, not only in the Pacific Northwest, but across America. Our Health Centers have reached farther, deeper and more broadly into our local communities than ever. The NUNM Health Center in Clackamas County, for example, with its group acupuncture, pain management and addictions treatment programs, has been warmly welcomed. Our Lair Hill and Beaverton Health Centers are now both credentialed as PCPCH Tier 4 providers. What we are about is education and service\u2014it's what our students want and our patients need. The campus footprint continues to evolve. The City of Portland said \"yes\" to our annexing the street beside Spaulding House for a new permaculture food forest. We are planning the university's first new building from the ground up, to house classrooms, faculty offices and Barlean's Family Kitchen\u2014our second teaching kitchen. There's more. More staff, more space, more classrooms, and an expanding community of partners, donors and colleagues, all building an enduring network for Oregon's newest university. We head into our seventh decade strong. This report tells a story of relevance and added value for our stakeholders. It chronicles an inspired community that responds to the call to action, building on the principles and philosophy of the natural medicine systems we love and serve. The need is urgent. Americans are not well; chronic disease and morbidity are rising. NUNM is doing something about it. David J. Schleich, PhD President Willow Moore, DC, ND Board Chair 5 NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF NATURAL MEDICINE 2016-2017 ANNUAL REPORT 6 A local publication once described NUNM's urban campus as \"an island amid a sea of pavement.\" We are surrounded by a maze of highways and streets and their steady rush of cars, trucks and buses coursing to destinations both near and far. But within our triangular five-acre campus footprint, NUNM hums with an energy all its own. After all, we are attuned to a higher vibration, serving the robust future of the field of natural medicine and holistic health. The physical blueprint for that future can be found in the university's 2012 Master Plan, which maps out campus changes. But change is being planned around our campus, as well. For several years, the City of Portland has been carefully laying the groundwork with Metro, the regional government for Portland and the surrounding metropolitan area, on plans for the Southwest Corridor Plan\u2014a proposed 12-mile light rail line from downtown Portland to Tigard and beyond. One street alignment decision within the project\u2014 Naito Parkway versus Barbur Boulevard\u2014remains undecided by city land use planners. The Naito alignment, if chosen, would dramatically reunify the Lair Hill neighborhood surrounding NUNM by reconfiguring traffic flow along the west side of the campus\u2014narrowing the street and radically slowing traffic. NUNM has been at the planning table for a long time, with the City and Metro, lobbying for safer and easier access to a campus long accustomed to the noise and distraction created by its Within our triangular five-acre campus footprint, NUNM hums with an energy all its own.urban boundaries. The Southwest Corridor Plan Steering Committee is expected to make a final determination on the transit alignment in early 2018. NUNM's advocacy for beautification of its campus met with overwhelming success in March when the Portland City Council voted unanimously to approve NUNM's long-awaited request to vacate Hooker Street. That approval was the first step toward tearing up pavement to create the Minh Chau Garden, a permaculture garden to be planted between Spaulding House and the Lair Hill Academic Building. This first phase of planning for the Garden was funded by benefactors Michael and Simone Chilton. Simone's Vietnamese name is Minh Chau. Growing enrollment in new programs continues to create a demand for more classroom space. Thus, the NUNM board approved construction of a new facility to adjoin the Lair Hill Health Center. The two-story, 7,000-square-foot building will accommodate a student lounge, faculty offices and classrooms, as well as a university art gallery. The centerpiece of the new space will be the Barlean's Family Kitchen, funded by Barleans, the manufacturer of omega-3 fish oil and other health supplements. Groundbreaking is expected to take place in 2018. There are many moving parts prior to construction, including the demolition of the Service Building, which sits across from the proposed new building and served as offices for clinic, facility and security staff. This triggered the renovation of the \"bunker\" storage facility next to the Administration Building into two floors of office suites. Located on the north side of campus, the efficient and attractive new facility was christened the \"Stone-Bleything Wing\" to honor two NUNM founders, Drs. Charles Stone and W. Martin Bleything. 7 NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF NATURAL MEDICINE 2016-2017 ANNUAL REPORT 8 Growing numbers of students enter NUNM classrooms keenly aware their lives are about to be transformed as they prepare for careers in the natural healing professions. The beginning of every academic year is infused with anticipation and excitement. But this year was exceptional, marking the matriculation of NUNM's first cohort of undergraduate students, 29 strong. Their passion for health drew them to programs in integrative health sciences and nutrition. Before they leave NUNM with degrees in hand, these students will develop capstone projects as diverse and varied as they are. Their ideas may span explorations of indigenous foods to food forest development, to women's health in underserved populations. These pioneers of the School of Undergraduate & Part-Time Studies are preparing to enter a healthcare workforce eager to welcome them. We will watch their progress with confidence and gratitude. We continue to grow our graduate programs, as well. We have submitted a proposal to the NWCCU for a Master of Science in Ayurveda, and are awaiting approval. The university's most recent academic offering, a Master of Science in Integrative Mental Health continues to draw current and prospective students. The Master of Science in Global Health students are completing field classwork assignments in an array of locations from India and the Philippines to Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore. CLAP-IN, NUNM'S TRADITIONAL WELCOMENEW STUDENT ORIENTATION NUNM's classical Chinese medicine programs, unique not only in the U.S., but throughout the world, attract a special caliber of student, fiercely devoted to learning the healing traditions that stretch back through time immemorial. With our Doctor of Science in Oriental Medicine program now in its second full year, our first graduates are taking their hard-earned knowledge into a world where addictions and chronic disease cry out for their help. Besides the intensive classroom and clinical training they receive, our new grads have a rare opportunity to apply for residency in Chinese medicine. Our residency program is believed to be the only one available at a university or college medical center in the U.S. It was featured on the front page of the AOM journal, Acupuncture Today: \"AOM Residency at NUNM.\" Our flagship naturopathic program, meanwhile, continues to offer opportunities seeded by Portland's rich tapestry of healthcare institutions. Our partnerships with Oregon Health & Science University and Legacy Emanuel Hospital provide NUNM's naturopathic medical students hands-on learning experiences using high-fidelity mannequins that can simulate patients' responses to real-time treatment for chronic disease. At the same time, NUNM continues to enhance and expand its \"Nature Cure\" roots through curriculum, student retreat opportunities, and a plethora of student clubs. The beginning of every academic year is infused with anticipation and excitement. WHITE COAT CEREMONY UNDERGRAD ORIENTATION 9 NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF NATURAL MEDICINE 2016-2017 ANNUAL REPORT 10 From its earliest days, NUNM has always been committed to engaging with the larger community to which it belongs. Community is integral to NUNM's philosophy, values, continuing growth and success\u2014reaching deeply into the areas in which we serve, whether it's providing patient care through our community clinic network, educating healthcare professionals in communities far and near, or developing long-lasting relationships with research or business partners. This year, for example, NUNM Health Centers, in partnership with Clackamas County's Beavercreek Health Center, began providing acupuncture treatment for addiction and pain management support to patients in Oregon City. The shifts are full; word-of-mouth is spreading. Our licensed practitioners and their student interns are meeting an overwhelming need. The demand for our medicine speaks to its quality. And the quality of the full-service health care that NUNM provides its patients is well known. The Oregon Health Authority certified both NUNM Lair Hill and Beaverton Health Centers as Tier 4 Patient-Centered Primary Care Homes this year, a designation that attests to the high service quality that our teams of naturopathic physicians and Chinese medicine practitioners give their patients. Regina Dehen, ND, LAc, NUNM's chief medical officer and dean of clinics, has championed this important community-based effort. Her tireless work at NUNM was recognized this year by Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, who appointed Dr. Dehen to serve BEAVERTON HEALTH CENTER FAME DOC CORY SZYBALA SHARING NUTRITION PEARLS ON KGW NEWSon the Oregon Medicaid Advisory Committee, a key voice in developing policy recommendations for the Oregon Legislature and Oregon Health Authority. NUNM's community commitment is also evident in the work underway at our Helfgott Research Institute. Helfgott completed its first year of two five-year National Institutes of Health research grants awarded to fund NUNM's studies underway with the University of Washington (UW) and Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). The UW study is cross-training investigators in complementary and integrative medicine protocols. The OHSU study is studying the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction in multiple sclerosis. The power of NUNM's capacity for community-building is perhaps best illustrated through the work of its Institutes\u2014 our community classes and symposia. A shining example of this is the Food as Medicine Everyday (FAME) workshop series presented to female adults in custody at Coffee Creek Correctional Facility in Wilsonville, Oregon. Hundreds of women have gained valuable skills through the workshops. The popular classes have a following. Every class is full, with waiting lists for future classes. The FAME classes fill up quickly on campus, too, with families working together to create simple, nutritious whole-foods meals\u2014and developing life-changing health habits in the process. The community workshops will soon have a home base on campus when the Barlean's Family Kitchen opens in the new campus building in 2018. Our Continuing Education department knows all about developing community. NUNM CE had a banner year for symposia, workshops and seminars, attracting hundreds of attendees in the local area, but also developing an equally significant and growing online following. The year's events included symposia on nutrition, herbal medicine, women's health issues, and classical Chinese medicine. Workshops and seminars also honed in on specific health disorders and diseases, from diabetes to autoimmune disorders and dermatology, to special issue conferences examining medical cannabis, sports medicine and pain management. Whether NUNM is helping change the world around it through its clinics, workshops, or in the case of NUNM Press, the power of the written word\u2014we recognize the persistent potential of community to grow natural medicine and mitigate chronic disease. The NUNM community stretches from Portland to points throughout the nation and beyond\u2014from the island of Saipan in the Western Pacific, to the dusty roads of rural New Mexico. It is this ever-present impulse to build community that continues to propel NUNM into a future where the university's mission is welcome, needed and effective. BEAVERCREEK HEALTH CENTER The demand for our medicine speaks to its quality. And the quality of the full-service health care that NUNM provides its patients is well known. 11 NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF NATURAL MEDICINE 2016-2017 ANNUAL REPORT 12 \"Don't eat anything your great-great grandmother recognize SERVICES\u2014CLINICS PRIVATE GIFTS AND CONTRACTS OTHER REVENUE AND GAINS254,431 THE STORE767,756GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND CONTRACTS 13 NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF NATURAL MEDICINE Year Ended June 30, 2017 (with comparative totals for 2016) UnrestrictedTemporarily RestrictedPermanently RestrictedTotal 2017 2016 REVENUES & OTHER SUPPORT Tuition and fees $17,205,997 - - $17,205,997 $17,945,368 Private gifts and contracts 310,154 510 grants and contracts 340,980 - 767,756 622,539 Sales and services - clinics 2,470,429 - - 2,470,429 3,093,252 The Store 254,431 - - and gains 387,994 110,905 - 498,899 493,353 Net assets released from restrictions 1,391,035 (1,391,035) - - - Total revenues and other support $79,323 $510 $22,440,853 768,229 The - - 393,094 services $18,267,241 - - $18,267,241 Institutional support 442,648 Total expenses - net assets 51,517 79,323 510 of Activitiesgross assets $27,005,192net assets The financial statements are excerpts from the independent auditor's report.
