Share this with your provider at each visit. [How does Lacosamide affect the brain?](#688745866) - Brain cells work and talk to each other by generating electrical discharges. These discharges must be sent or fire at a certain rate to function normally. Sodium channels are like gates in brain cells - they help to spread electrical activity from one cell to another. - Most seizure medicines slow down the electrical discharges in some way. - Lacosamide may help to slow down or turn off sodium channels in the brain. This may help stop a seizure and allow brain cells to recover. [How does the body digest Lacosamide?](#688745866) How the body absorbs, digests, and gets rid of a medicine or food is called metabolism. The way the body breaks down a medicine affects how often it should be taken and if it will interact other medicines or food. Some medical conditions such as liver disease can also affect a drug's metabolism. - After taking lacosamide, the highest blood levels are reached in 1 to 4 hours. - It takes about 13 hours for the amount of medicine in the bloodstream to fall by at least 50%. This means that the medicine should be taken twice a day, about 12 hours apart. - Lacosamide is broken down in the liver. The kidneys clear the medicine from the body. - People with poor kidney function may need a lower dose of drug, as it may stay in the bloodstream longer. [How well does the Lacosamide work?](#688745866) Not all seizure medicines work for everyone. Your health care provider may try a series of medicines or more than one seizure medicine at a time to find one that works best for you. In studies of lacosamide, when it was used with other seizure medicines in people with uncontrolled seizures, the following benefits were seen. - Number of seizures was reduced by about 35 to 40% - About 40% of people had their seizures lowered by 50% - A study using lacosamide alone (as monotherapy) in people with uncontrolled seizures was also helpful to control focal seizures. [What are the most common side effects of Lacosamide?](#688745866) Th most common side effects include: - Coordination problems - Dizziness - Double vision - Headache - Nausea, vomiting - Sleepiness - Unsteady walking Problems with coordination and walking usually get better over a few weeks. Tell your provider if the problems continue. - Do not operate any heavy machinery or do other dangerous activities if you are having side effects affecting coordination, walking or safety. - Talk to your provider about driving and do not drive if you are still having seizures. In clinical trials, some people stopped taking lacosamide more often due to dizziness than for other side effects. Less common side effects: - Change in blood tests of liver function and blood counts have been seen in small numbers of people. These could make a person prone to anemia or infections. - Electrocardiograms (ECGs) of heart rhythms showed a slowing of electrical signal in the heart (called PR prolongation) in some people. The chance of this happening may be related to the dose used. - People with known heart rhythm or conduction problems should talk to their doctor before using this medicine. [What are the most serious side effects of Lacosamide?](#688745866) Very few people have serious side effects from lacosamide. It is important to be aware of possible reactions and what to do if they happen. - Read the package insert for more information. - Call your provider's office right away if any of these problems occur. Heart rhythm problems: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) of heart rhythms showed a slowing of electrical signal in the heart (called PR prolongation) in some people. The risk of a heart rhythm problem called atrial fibrillation may be higher. These heart rhythm problems are usually rare. - People with heart problems or on higher doses of lacosamide may be at higher risk. Low white blood cells: Rarely, a drop in white blood cells may be seen. Allergic reactions: Allergic reactions happen rarely, but can cause symptoms such as low blood pressure, hives, rash, breathing difficulties, and swelling. It can happen after the first dose or any time when taking lacosamide. Since this can be life-threatening, if these symptoms occur, get immediate medical help. Suicidal thoughts and behavior: In 2008, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed data from drug studies that showed a possible relationship between many seizure medicines and suicidal thoughts and behavior. Together, these thoughts and behavior are called suicidality. According to the FDA's Alert, among the patients with epilepsy in these drug studies, more had symptoms of suicidality than people taking a placebo or inactive substance - 3.5 of 1,000 people taking a seizure medicine had suicidality compared to 1 of 1,000 people taking a placebo. - Taking seizure medicines may increase the risk of having suicidal thoughts or actions. - Do not make any changes to the medicines without first talking to the prescribing health care provider. - Pay close attention to any day-to-day changes in mood, behavior and actions. These changes can happen very quickly so it is important to be mindful of any sudden differences. - Be aware of common warning signs that might be a signal for risk of suicide. Some of these are: - Talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life - Withdrawing from friends and family - Becoming depressed or having your depression get worse - Becoming preoccupied with death and dying - Giving away prized possessions - Contact your health care provider before stopping any seizure meicine.

Talk to your doctor if you are on one of these medicines or if changes are seen when taking other seizure medicines. The dose of medicines may need to be changed. - Changes in heart rate may be seen if lacosamide is taken with certain medicines that slow the heart rate.

[If a woman takes Lacosamide during pregnancy will it hurt the baby?](#688745866) Effect of seizure medicines during pregnancy: In the United States, the FDA assigns each medication to a Pregnancy Category according to whether it has been proven to be harmful in pregnancy. Lacosamide is listed in Pregnancy Category C.

This vitamin is thought to help prevent birth defects affecting the brain and spinal cord, called neural tube defects. The most common of these is known as spina bifida. - Women at high risk of having a child with a birth defect (such as those with a birth defect in a previous pregnancy or taking certain seizure medicines) may be asked to take 4 mg (4000 mcg) daily before and during pregnancy. - Talk to your health care provider about using folic acid and how much to take. - Start taking this vitamin before you become pregnant. If you were taking lacosamide while pregnant, consider enrolling in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry by calling 1-888-233-2334 ( [www.aedpregnancyregistry.org](http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/)). Seizures during pregnancy: Some women may have more seizures during pregnancy, because of hormone changes and how seizure medicine is handled by your body. - Talk to your health care provider before pregnancy about seizures and if medicine changes may be needed. - Know when to check blood levels of medicine during and after pregnancy. - The dose of seizure medicine may need to be adjusted during and after pregnancy.

[What are the effects of Lacosamide on Seniors](#688745866) Information on use of lacosamide in older adults is limited. - Seniors may have a higher risk of drug interactions, as they may be taking more medicines in general. For example, older adults taking a medicine that may affect heart rate should be watched closely. - Older adults may be more sensitive to certain side effects, for example, dizziness, sleepiness, poor coordination or unsteady walking. These problems could lead to falls or accidents, so seniors should report any side effects to their provider. [What are the dose ranges for Lacosamide?](#688745866) The best amount of seizure medicine is the amount that controls seizures without causing bothersome side effects. This depends on many factors, which are different for every person. - The approved dose range of lacosamide for adults is 200 to 400 mg daily. - When used as the only seizure medicine, the lowest recommended dose is 300 mg. - Lower doses may be used if people have side effects or the amount may be increased more slowly. - Higher doses may be needed in some people as well, though higher doses may cause more side effects.
