Health Care Resources: You are the Consumer This workbook is to help you learn about health care resources, so th2t you know how tokeep yourself healthy, when you might need to see a health professional, and where to goif you do need to see someone. You and your teacher can decide the best way for you tolearn this:either working on your own with the cassette, or learning from your teacherwith the rest of the class. If working on your own with the cassette is best for you, the first step is to talk to yourteacher about when it's available. When you have the tape and are ready to begin, find awell-lit room, a comfortable chair, and a steady writing surface. I'll be saying exactly what is on the pages of your workbook so that you can read along withme. If you would like to listen to a certain section again, or need to think for a minute,feel free to stop the tape at anytime. In the workbook, you will see certain wordsunderlined.These are words that are explained in the glossary. If you are still unsureabout what the word means, ask your teacher to help you. You will hear a \"BEEP\" after I give you instructions. Stop the tape after the beep, so thatyou can work on the exercises. Don't be nervous about them. They will help youremember what you hax e learned. If you have trouble with the answers, you can eitherreview the section again by yourself, or ask your teacher for help. You should also talkwith your teacher about your progress. Your teacher is there to help you, even if you justneed to talk with someone about where to find health care. treatments.What's the first thing you think of when you hear \"health care?\" Weused to picture a male doctor in a white coat with a stethoscope,offering a bottle of pills.These days, the picture is different. Thereare lots of choices for health care providers and different kinds ofWith all of these choices, how do we know what's best for us? And, evenmore importantly, how do we get what we need? This workbook will help you answer these questions. It will tell you about types of healthcare available, how to decide when to get help from a health professional, and how to gethelp once you've decided you need it. This information can help improve the overall healthof both you and your family. After completing this workbook, you will be able to: Enter the health care system.Understand different levels of health care and choose the best level for you.Know the rights and responsibilities of patients and health professionals.Know that forming good health behaviors and using the right health careresources are your own responsibility.Name where health care resources are in your community, and what they do. Before starting to sort out the health care system, let's explore the real meaning of \"health,\"because what you believe and expect will make a difference in your health care from nowOn . Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumcr 2 There are many meanings of health. Webster's Dictionary lists four different meanings: Everybody's talking about health today. Not long ago, health was only aproblem when someone was sick or hurt, and when physical disease or painseemed to come on suddenly. In time, health has come to mean ouroverall condition, even when we're not sick, and it doesn't mean justphysical wellness. We know there are important links between our bodies and our thoughtsand feelings, our environment at home and at work, and our personal beliefs and sense ofwho we are. All of these combine to build a complete healthy person, or to create \"holistic\"health. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 36 Thomas Edison said, \"The doctor of the future will give no medicine, but will interest hispatients in the care of the human frame, in diet, and in the cause and prevention ofdisease.\" Today, we talk about how health can be a positive and active state of well-beingthat our own actions affect. Health has a different meaning for each of us, depending onwho we are and what we do and see in our lives. Please stop the tape at the beep and complete Worksheet #1 on the next page.*** Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 4 WORKSHEET #1Wellness Scale Extremely ExtremelySick Healthy Mark some different points along the wellness line and tell where you would be at each point.Example: if you were extremeb, sick, would you be in the hospital? Do you think \"extremelywell\" means being able to run a marathon or not having a disease? Now mark where you are on the wellness rcale. What do you do now to keep yourself healthy?What specific steps can you take to impro.'e your health? Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 5 We each deal with our health in a way most comfortable to us. Some oc ussee health in the hands of someone like a health professicnal, family member,nurse, or spiritual healer. Others want to learn all we can to meet the healthcare needs of ourselves and our families. Our own sense of ownership,control, and understanding all support good health. We are also affected by society and by the huge advances in health care today. Forexample, antibiotics and immunizations brought quick fixes to fatal and common illnesses.Other things like organ transplants made health care seem almost magical. As we learn more about health care, we hear complaints about costs,quality, and the trouble with getting health care. Remember that you area \"consumer,\" or buyer of health care. The health care provider works foryou and is paid for a service that fills your needs. Therefore, the healthcare provider answers to you, like you ar:swer to your boss. Therelationship between you and your health care provider is partly a business one whichserves the customer (you), and partly a partnership working to meet your needs as apatient. Speaking of needs, there are many different types of health needs. You should figure outyour own and your family's needs. There are many ways to think about and sort out healthcare needs. You can think about spe6a1 conditions like cancer or heart disease, or you canthink about groups of people like children, older people, or pregnant women. There areso many choices that it can be very confusing. Don't let this scare you. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 6 One simple way to learn about and take care of your health needs is to know the threelevels of prevention: Primary prevention happens before there is a problem. This can include things likeregular check-ups, children's shots, breast exams, and taking care of yourself byexeicising, eating well, and learning about health. It could be pre-natal care forhealthy babies, well-baby care, and regular dental check-ups. This first level ofprevention is the foundation for lifelong health. Secondary prevention happens when a health problem starts or when someone mightbe at risk for a problem because of personal or family history. This could includethings like the start of allergies, small infections, or prevention work with childrenwhose parents are hooked on alcohol or other drugs. Filling tooth cavities, gettingyearly eye exams, helping to quit smoking, or testing for sickle cell anemia orhemophilia (if it's in the family) are all secondary prevention. The main thing aboutthis level is early discovery and treatment of health problems so they don't get worse.Usually, the second level combines professional help with self-care. Tertiary prevention is also called treatment. It usually starts with professional helpfor a problem you already have. This may be a heart attack, stroke, or mental orphysical illness like diabetes, schizophrenia, or chronic pain. It could also betreatment for alcohol or other drug addiction, surgery or chemotherapy for cancer,or physical therapy after an injury or stroke. The main focus of this level is to:Cure the problem whenever possible,Keep the disease from getting worse,Provide recovery as much as possible, andGive the best care to reduce pain and improve comfort if recovery isnot possible. These three basic levels can help you with health care. Hopefully, it will help you use thehealth care system so you can get earlier, better, and calmer care. You can get health care through individuals, groups, organizations, andfacilities.In New York State, professionals must be licensed, registered,or certified to practice by the State Edutation Department, or peoplesupervised by such regulated professionals. Also, health care organizationsmust live up to standards of the Health Department or other state agencies. Usually, youcan get care from a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, or chiropractics. These days, otherprofessionals such as nurse practitioners and health professionals' assistants often give muchof the primary and even secondary levels of care. The best thing you can do is find a health care professional that you trust. The mainhealth professional you see is called your primary health care provider. This person takescare of your main health care needs. He or she helps you get information, answersquestions, and gives advice or referrals to more specialized health care professionals. Your primary health care provider will know you, your health care history,and your health needs, and be a main contact point with the health caresystem. Also, your family's health records will be kept in the same placeso they're ready to be referred to right away. Hopefully, if you have aprimary health care provider you will be treated more like a person andless like a \"number.\" Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 8 Now let's talk about health professionals in private practice, ambulatory care facilities, andthe hospital. Health professionals can practice alone or in a group. If your health professional practices alone, or solo, you will you see the same healthprofessional all the time.The setting is usually pleasant, friendly, and lessbusinesslike.You may have to go somewhere else for laboratory services andyour health professional may not be on call after normal business hours or duringemergencies. Health professionals in group practice work together and share staff,patients, records, and costs. They often offer 24-hour on-callservices. They usually can hire more specialized people, buy moreerluipment, and offer more services and tests. They can also easilyconsult with each other and share records to give you more thorough care. On the otherhand, you may feel like you're getting less personal care. Be careful and ask lots of questions if your health professional refers you to other groupmembers instead of to other professionals or facilities. Sometimes members of a grouppractice may leave after a couple of years, which will force you to either change healthprofessionals or move to a new practice. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 1 29 Ambulatory care facilities give day-to-day care. Most health professionals see patients inthese types of places, which might be their offices or clinics. It's important for you to knowand use these services in a way that helps you most. Clinics can be independent (not part of another institution), part of a hospital, orprivately owned by a business. They may be public, non-profit, or for profit. Youraccess, cost, and level of care will depend on who runs the clinic. For example, yourcare at a public clinic may depend on your income, or you may pay a lower rate ata non-profit clinic.Also, certain clinics may only provide certain services. Atraditional clinic usually provides counseling, social work, and health educationactiAties, as well as pre-natal care and other health care services. Some clinics willbe attached to, or affiliated with, another clinic that gives dental care or eye care. Health Maintenance Organizations or HMOs are usually found in or near larger cities.They are like clinics, but for members only. HMO members get prepaid services,which means they:Pay one set fee per month,Get direct care for many health services, like dental and eye care, andGo to hospitals or other facilities owned by or under contract with theHMO.The HMO often has health professionals on salary and owns or has a contract witha hospital.In an Independent Practice Association or IPA, which is kind of like anHMO, you still get prepaid care, but you can choose your health care professionalsfrom a list of approved providers. HMOs often provide more services, use a numberof community providers, and stress prevention. However, there might be limits oncare and high turnover among staff. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 10 13 Hospitals are the most visible health care facilities. Not only are about10% of Americans hospitalized each year, hospitals also provide jobs fora lot of people. Many hospitals are now adding ambulatory care or clinicsand home health care. The four major types of hospitals are specializedhospitals, general non-profit community hospitals, government hospitals,and for-profit hospitals. Specialized hospitals care for specific diseases or complex problems like cancer orphysical rehabilitation. General non-profit community hospitals are the most common type of hospital. Theyoffer lots of services for both inpatients and outpatients. Government hospitals are usually for special groups, like military veterans. They maybe owned by local, state, or federal government agencies. The most commongovernment hospital is the Veterans Administration system, which runs over 150hospitals in the country. For-profit hospitals are becoming more popular these days. These hospitals usuallyprovide good quality care, but may not offer very expensive services (such as burncare) or all the services you need. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 11 Who you choose for main, emergency, or specialized care depends on: Where you live,How you will get there,When you can go,How much it costs and what insurance is accepted,Whether you like large or small facilities,Language,Reputation, and\"Bedside manner\" of the health care provider. Some people choose a primary health care provider based on what kind of care they needmost often. For instance, some women see their gynecologists most often, and use themfor primary care. Others are happy with a team in a local clinic because they also get goodpre-natal and pediatric care.'*:*\" =::*In choosing your primary health care provider, you will want someone withtraining and experience in dealing with your particular health needs. Lookfor posted degrees, licenses, and certificates in the office. Ask pastpatients or other health professionals you trust for recommendations. Useyour own instincts when choosing a arimary health care provider.If English is not yourmain language, be sure to ask if the provider speaks your native tongue.

Me answers to this worksheet are in the back of this workbook.Provides day-to-day care Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 1316 You should think about your future needs for emergency or special care.If you've already been to or like a certain hospital, your provider shoulddeal with that hospital.If you don't have a favorite hospital, yourprimary health care provider can help you decide what hospital to go to. In choosing a hospital, there are several things to consider, such as: Your health professional's advice. It's better to choose a hospital where your healthprofessional is so that he or she will be able to treat you there. You can go to thehospital emergency room or be treated as an outpatient before seeing your healthprofessional.However, if you need to be admitted to the hospital, a healthprofessional from the hospital staff will be assigned to you. If your own primaryhealth care provider is a staff member, you will be in the hands of someone you knowwho knows you.Also,hospitals usually allow more highly-qualified healthprofessionals to practice there. If a health professional practices in a good hospital,you can usually assume that he or she is good. Poor-quality health professionals havetrouble being allowed to practice in good hospitals, while poor-quality hospitals havetrouble getting good-quality health professionals. Talk to your friends and family about the overall reputation of different hospitals. Ifsomeone you know works in a hospital, ask him or her about that hospital as well asother hospitals in your area. Hospitals affiliated with a medical school usually havehigh-quality care, but be aware that medical students, interns, and residents oftenobserve or give care. Hospitals with residency programs usually have high-quality care. The hospital's reputation for your specific need is as important as its overall reputation.Care is often better in a hospital where the specific procedure or service you requireis performed a lot.So, choose a hospital according to your special needs. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 14 Find out if your hospital accepts your health insurance coverage before you have anemergency. If the hospital doesn't participate in your insurance program, you will haveto pay for all or at least part of your bill. Size may also be a factor in your decision. Small hospitals are usually good at providingroutine care. However, sma' i hospitals may not be able to provide special care sincethey don't have the money or number of patients. Small, out-of-the-way hospitals mayalso not attract hospital staff. Finally, you should personally inspect any hospital you are thinking about to be sure youfeel comfortable with its staff cleanliness, and the overall feel of it. Look also foraccreditations, or certain standards to which a hospital must live up to.These areusually posted in the main lobby. Since accreditation is very easy to get, a hospitalwithout it is suspicious. Spending any length of time at a hospital is very serious and very expensive. Since thereare so many health care options, it's wise to shop around. In an emergency situation, you probably won't be able to shop around forhealth care.It's best to decide now where you will go if an accidenthappens. Examples of emergency health care are setting broken bones,counseling someone who attempted suicide, treating burns or infections,and stopping bleeding. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 1 815 Choosing a provider for emergency care depends on where the emergency happens, as wellas your type of health coverage. For example, if you belong to an HMO, you must get careor approval from an HMO health professional unless it is a life-or-death situation. If youdon't, you may not get care or might be billed directly for the services. Before an emergency occurs, find out what emergency care is available through yourprimary health care provider and what you should do in case of an emergency. Planwhether or not you might have to call an ambulance and know what number to call. You'llbe upset during a crisis, so the fewer decisions you have to make in an emergency, thebetter. Please stop the tape at the beep and complete Worksheet #3 on the next page. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer*** 1 916 WORKSHEET #3 Use what you have just learned to make notes about the hospitals in your area. You may wantto talk with a classmate or your teacher to help you answer the questions. 1.My special needs are: 2.These are the hospitals in my area: 3.Out of the hospitals in my area, my primary health care provider is affiliated withthese: 4.Do any of the hospitals work with medical schools or have residency programs? 5.Which of the above hospitals accept my insurance? Health Care Resources: You Are the Conswner 17 9 If you need special care, there are many resources to meet your needs.Again, your primary health care provider, as well as friends and family,can help you sort out the options and give you advice. You might alsotry asking around. Lots of times people who have gone through thesame thing can help you and lend support at the same time. Remember, though -- theirexperience won't always be thc same as yours. They may offer well-intended but wrongadvice. Use your own sense and that of your primary health care provider, and learn asmuch as you can about your condition. Here are some examples of specialized care: Specialist professionals have extra training in a certain area. Examples are surgeons,psychiatrists,nurse midwives and nurse practitioners, internists,pediatricians, andobstetricians. Besides basic training, these health professionals have either a special licenseor certification by the state or national board in a specialty area. Some specialistprofessionals take certain approaches. For example, chiropractors look at the centralnervous system and the spine. Licensed physical therapists are another example. To finda specialist, start by looking in the yellow pages of the phone book, then contact yourcounty medical society for more information. ROOne specialist who can be very helpful is your pharmacist, who can explainmedications, side effects, and combinations to avoid with foods and othermedications.Your pharmacist may also be able to substitute a genericversion of your name-brand prescription, which costs you a lot less. Callaround before choosing a pharmacist, then go to the same one each time.He or she will keep track of medications you are taking or have taken in the past. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 18 More and more these days, people are getting health care at home. Thiseither allows them to stay home and out of nursing homes longer, or toleave hospitals for home earlier. Home health care is usually provided by 4+a registered professional nurse (RN), or a licensed practical nurse (LPN)or certified home health aide working under an RN. Home health caremay be found through a hospital or public and private agencies like the Visiting NurseAssociation. Home health care is very expensive. More insurance companies are startingto cover home care if ordered by a health professional. If home health care isn't possible, there are many inpatient facilities which care for peoplewho either can't care for themselves or who can't leave because of health needs. Weusually think of nursing homes when we think of long-term care, though many differentkinds of patients are served. Your choices depend on where you live. Your primary healthcare provider will know about standards, admission policies, and facility reputation, and canhelp you decide what might best meet your needs. For patients with terminal illness, hospice care means both the physical and emotionalhealth needs of the patient as well as the needs of his or her family. Hospice services maybe inpatient, outpatient through home care visits, or both. They educate and supportcaregivers and those in the grieving process. While becoming more common, hospice careis not available everywhere. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 19 Mental health services are operated by the state, community-based, orprivately operated for profit. Treatment can be short- or long-term,and is available as outpatient, emergency, and inpatient. Services mayinclude psychiatric treatment, nursing care, social work, and counseling.When choosing a mental health facility, check professional and agencycertifications and licenses, how much it costs, what they expect in patient involvement, andwhat types of treatment are used. For a list of New York State mental health offices, seeAppendix A. Help for alcohol and drug abuse is also very important. Because of thegreat interest and need in this area, we have written another module in thisseries called, Alcohol and Other Drugs. Please see that module for moreinformation and resources about care for alcohol and drug problems. At this point, please turn the tape over to Side B. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer*** 9 It20 Besides professional health care, there are many organizationswhich provide information, research, and support for particularconditions or diseases. Many of these organizations are started bypatients and their families because of the gaps in health care those people needed. Groupslike the American Cance: Society, Association for Retarded Citizens, March of Dimes,American Heart Association, and many, many others often lead change and improvementin the health care system. Their newsletters, pamphlets, and meetings can be a great helpto people who are feeling alone. In addition to the groups just mentioned, there are other support groups for variousconditions, like the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Association or ALSA for Lou Gehrig'sDisease; Reach to Recovery, a program operated by the American Cancer Society forwomen facing breast surgery as a result of cancer; the AIDS Council; and support groupsoffered through the Sickle Cell Disease Foundation of Greater New York. Ask yourprimary health care provider if there is an organization that can help you. Most of the support services we talked about are free, but we all know thathealth care is not. Health care costs have been growing out of control inthe past ten years. One of the biggest problems in our country is how toprovide good health care to everyone. Whether having major surgery orjust basic immunization shots, paying for health care is becoming anightmare for more and more people, especially those who don't have insurance. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 21 goWith health care costs so high, how can we care for ourselves and our families? One wayis to cut down on needless trips to the wrong health care provider. Having a primaryhealth care provider to care for your everyday needs or refer you to a specialist is oneimportant step in the right direction. There are other things we can do to keep our costsdown, while keeping ourselves in the best health we can. It's been said that 70% of hospital patients could have avoided going into the hospital ifthey had followed some simple preventive measures. The following steps can help stopillness or injury: Healthy adults of age 16 - 35 should have medical check-ups once everytwo years. Different age groups, however, have different needs. Childrenshould be examined once or twice a year, and adults age 35 - 40 should seea health professional once a year. Children should start seeing a dentistonce or twice a year before starting school, and everyone should have a yearly eye examby either an optometrist or an ophthalmologist. A simple way to keep track of check-upsis to write them on a calendar, maybe posted on the refrigerator. Please stop the tape at the beep and see the chart on the next page for more check-up guidelinesfrom the American Cancer Society.

However, if you have a chronic diseaseor condition like diabetes, you should see your health professional regularly. The key toprevention is knowing your body when it's normal. Once you know this, you'll be moreaware of anything odd which may warn you to see a heal th professional. You may alsosave time and money if it's something you can care for yourself. 'You can keep track ofyour normal health by answering these questions every so often: Are there any foods ;that make you feel sick or uncomfortable?

Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 26 In addition to examining your body, you should get into other healthy habits to helpprevent injury and disease. A wholesome diet plays a key part in keeping you healthy. Don'tovereat, and avoid foods that are high in saturated fat, cholesterol,salt, and sugar.Try to eat lots of different nutritious foods likewhole-grain breads and cereals, fruits, and vegetables. For more information on nutrition,see the module in this series called Nutrition: Eating for Better Health. Getting enough sleep is a basic need for your body to work its best, both physically andmentally.Most adults need about eight hours of sleep for good health. Remember,though, that each person is different and it's okay if you need more or less sleep to feelgood.Try to stick with the same sleeping hours each night so you don't find yourselfunable to sleep at all, which is called insomnia. Exercise will help your health by making your heart and lungs work better.It's important to fit an exercise Program into what you need and what youcan do. An average, healthy adult should exercise at least three times perweek for thirty minutes.If you plan to start an exercise program, be sure to consult yourhealth professional first. For more information on physical fitness, see the module in thisseries called Exercise: Benefits for Body and Mind. Alcohol andlor drug use should be kept at a minimum, if used at all. Theycan threaten health in many ways. Drunk driving and birth defects fromdrug and alcohol abuse are just two examples of the danger. If you useintravenous (IV) drugs, cut down your chance of contracting HIV, thevirus which causes AIDS, by refusing to share needles with anyone and cleaning yourneedles with bleach. For more information on drug and alcohol abuse, see the module inthis series called Alcohol and Other Drugs. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 3027 Safer sex, or not having sex at all, can reduce your chances of getting sexually-transmitteddiseases, including AIDS. The safest sex is no sex at all, but if you are sexually active, usecondoms. For more information on safer sex, please see the book, HIT/ Education for AdultLiteracy Students. Being safe at work, at home, and in the car is also important. For example,if all people who rode in the front seat of a car buckled their seatbelts,about 15,275 deaths and hundreds of thousands of injuries wouldn'thappen'.Allow extra time for trips and take a minute to catch yourbreath before continuing -- feeling rushed often causes accidents. Improved dental practices have cut down on the number of people who haveto wear dentures, or false teeth. Keep your smile healthy by brushing yourteeth with a toothpaste recommended by the American Dental Association(check the toothpaste box), brushing and flossing at least once a day(morning, bedtime, and after meals is best), and seeing your dentist twice per year. Thedental hygienist at your dentist's office can show you the best way to take care of yourteeth, and will sometimes give you free samples. A positive outlook on life will also help both your physical and mental health.Know what stresses you out or really bothers you, then make plans forrelieving or getting rid of those stressful things. Sometimes it helps to get itall out by talking to a friend or support group. It's good to judge your outlookon life every day. 'Statistics courtesy of the Governor's Traffic Safety CotninitteeHealth Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 28 We've already talked about the most common ways to treat and prevent disease and injury,but there are also prevention techniques that some people think are unusual. For example,many people believe that yoga, a relaxation method, is the main reason they stay healthy.You could also look into the connection between the foods you eat and how you feel. Itmight help you to take extra vitamins or completely avoid certain foods, or follow a specialdiet like a vegetarian. Sometimes food allergies can cause symptoms peoplf ouldn't reallyconnect to food, like being tired. Be open to \"new-age\" nontraditional ways of preventive health care. Check out a localnatural foods store or bookstore that has information on herbs, hypnosis, massage,nutritional supplements, and acupuncture or acupressure. Some stores have bulletin boardsor newsletters, or may even know about classes you can sign up for. Before getting any \"alternative\" health care, discuss it with your primary health careprovider and find out if your insurance covers it. Sometimes you can help educate more\"traditional\" providers; other times your primary health care provider will already use lesstraditional approaches. For most people, not doing too much or too little of anything, or practicing moderation,is the key. \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,\" so take the time to decidewhat's best for you to get and stay healthy, and keep doing it! Because of the rising cost of health care and the fact that so many Americans don't haveinsurance, it's becoming more and more important for people to stay in good health andprevent illness as well as to evaluate, get, and use health care coverage. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 29 Though you could pay health care costs out of your own pocket, not many peoplecan afford to. Most people look for insurance coverage which will pay for somelevel of care. For more detailed information, see the module Health Insurance:The Facts You Need. For now, the following section will describe some options. Most health care coverage falls into two categories: coverage you get through your job, orcoverage you get from the government. You may also buy insurance privately if you don'tget it from either of these two sources, or to increase coverage from another source. Not all employers offer the benefit of health insurance. Some do, but they may require awaiting period before coverage begins. Many employers offer some form of group coveragebecause they are buying for a large number of people and can get a lower rate from theinsurance company. In this type of situation, employers may pay for all or part of the costof coverage. Some will pay for the employee's coverage, and the employee will pay the restof the cost for his or her family. If you become unable to make decisions about health care for yourself, you have the rightto arrange to have someone you trust make health care decisions for you, following yourwishes.New York State's Health Care Proxy Law explains how you can make thisarrangement.

Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 3834 Read and re-read the list of your rights before you get health care so you areclear and confident on getting what you have a right to. Dealing with abureaucratic system can be scary since they're built to be big and to serve lotsof people in the same ways. Though the health care system seems like one bigmess, it's actually a bunch of little organizations and individuals. People inthose organizations often feel as frustrated as you do because they realize thatsome things aren't well-organized or sensible or productive. Many have far more work thanthey can handle, and don't have time to enjoy the \"people\" part of their jobs. They canhandle most simple cases by following routine pi ocedures, but more complex cases andpersonal needs aren't handled unless YOU point it out. Help things run more smoothly by anticipating where things might go wrong. Call toremind your provider to check on a lab result, or ask what specifically that medication is,why you're taking it, and what the possible side effects are. Remember, though, thatpeople are people and even health professionals appreciate and respond to the same typeof treatment you do. For example: Be respectful and courteous (and expect the same in return). Greet the provider by name. Make a personal connection, if appropriate, by either commenting on theweather or the busy day. Be prepared for the visit.It can be very helpful to talk things through with afriend or family member in advance, to get clear on your needs. Make a list of questions or information points to read or show to the provider.This is important for telephone calls too. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 35 Think about taking a friend or family member with you for emotional support,or to help you remember, understand, and follow through on instructions.Don't, however, scare your provider into thinking that your companion is thereto judge or challenge him or her. Tell your provider that you will do whatever it takes to improve your health.This doesn't mean doing something you don't believe is right for you; it justmeans you're veiy interested and will do your part. Listen to the provider's instructions or comments all the way through.Interrupt only if you're confused. Repeat back, in your own words, what you were told to make sure youunderstand. Checking during the visit is easier on both you and your provider,and shows that you're serious about helping. Take notes if you need to, or ask your provider to give you written instructionsto take home. Follow through on care you agree on with your provider, and tell him or herwhat works or any changes you've noticed. Don't promise to make changesin your life, then show up next time not having changed anything. If you don'tagree on a treatment, say so up front so a different approach can be workedout. Help your provider and his or her staff recognize and reinforce quality care:express thanks as well as complaints. Tell them about especially good service. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 4 036 If you aren't satisfied with your care, try to sort out why: Is your provider always disrespecffid or unskilled?Was the provider having a stressful day?Does a provider seem unable to care for you for some reason? You deserve quality care no matter what, but you should judge the reason for not gettingit before you do anything about it. You can refuse care from a provider who seemsconsistently harmful or inappropriate, but if it happens once with a provider you trust, youmight think about why the incident occurs and wait to see if something odd happens again. If you aren't in immediate danger, take as little action as possible to getresults. This keeps you and the provider from overreacting and helpsto keep your relationship good. The first step would be to talk withyour provider alone.It would not be helpful to talk to the provider'sfriend or co-worker. If you don't get anywhere with the provider and still need to express your concern, the nextstep is to speak with that person's supervisor, making clear what was wrong and what youwould like to change. At some point you may need to put your concerns in writing. Bebrief and specific; give concrete examples of what was done or not done, and tell whatshould be done to correct the situation. Don't call names or insult people. Health Care Resources: You Are the Consumer 37 You might also look to the organization's board of directors; the government agency orinstitution which certifies the orgairGation or individual; or the professional association towhich the provider belongs for help. You may want to talk to a lawyer or other health careprofessionals to settle the situation. There are tons of materials on health and health care resources at yourlocal library, and librarians are there to help you find what you need.Your health care provider can help you find others depending on whatyou're interested in. Local health departments, hospitals, HMOs, clinics, and other providers sometimes holdclasses on certain topics, which are often free to the public. Check your local communitycalendar and billboard sections of your local newspaper for listings. You can be successful in figuring out the health care system by breaking it down into small,understandable pieces. Take control of your own well-being by learning more about yourbody and how to keep it healthy. Next, shop around for a primary health care providerwho will take care of your needs -- talk with your current provider, a school nurse, healthteacher, or a friend or neighbor who's had good experiences with health care.

To detect testicularcancer early, it is best to complete a simple three-minute self-examination every month. The best time to do a TSE is after a warm bath or shower, when the scrotal skin ismost relaxed. Roll each testicle gently between the thumb and fingers of both hands. If you feel any hard lumps or nodules, you should see a health professionalimmediately, who will make a diagnosis. The symptoms of testicular cancer include a slight enlargement of one of the testes, achange in its consistency, and/or a dull ache in the lower abdomen and groin. This painmay be accompanied with a feeling of dragging and heaviness. Please also note that menwho have an undescended or partially descended testicle are at a higher risk of developingtesticular cancer. Courtesy of the American Cancer Society, Inc.
