There are multiple reasons why people heal and why they don't! It's ultimately up to you to begin to take control of your life and health. Then we begin to understand the factors that affect our ability to heal. Let's evaluate some of the reasons why people don't heal! One of the greatest missing pieces in people's understanding is... Chiropractic's role: The role of chiropractic in one's healing potential is important and should be understood. Chiropractic is viewed by many people as only being used to treat pain and conditions related to the back. Chiropractic plays a crucial role in the functioning of the nervous system. The nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves, is responsible for carrying out messaging to and from various organs. Including, skeletal muscles, body chemistry, immune system, and other bodily systems. Every system in the human body is under the influence of the nervous system, and it can be interfered with. A chiropractor's job is to locate and correct subluxations or misalignments of the spine for a better expression of communication, coordination, and function within the body. It is vital that this system is working at 100% for the patient's benefit. What else matters? There are dozens, maybe hundreds or thousands of factors, let's look at my favorites! Stress! Many factors can affect an individual's ability to heal, and stress is one of the biggest causes of disease. However, practitioners often ignore or disregard stress due to its phantom nature. Since 2020, depression, anxiety, and suicide rates have increased. Stress can be caused by various factors such as excessive screen time, lack of connection with nature, and consumption of sugar, alcohol, caffeine, and prescription drugs. Breathing and meditation are beneficial practices for lowering stress levels. There are many different ways to achieve this, although these 2 practices are highly recommended. - Breathing: Nasal Breathing (especially through the left nostril) assists in relaxation and an increase in parasympathetic activity (rest and digest) within the body. Try this, take 2 minutes and breathe completely through your nose for 4 counts in, and 8 counts out... how do you feel? Now do it again, do it multiple times a day until you are feeling relaxed! - Meditation: I am a huge fan of meditation I have an entire center called [The Center at Keystone.](http://www.centeratkeystone.com)The Center is located below Keystone Specific Chiropractic, which is dedicated to [meditation](https://centeratkeystone.com/meditation/)and ancient spiritual practices. These practices help people de-stress, relax, and achieve greater inner awareness and peace. Letting go of control is another important aspect of the healing journey. Micromanaging every single aspect of one's life can cause unnecessary stress and hinder healing. Sleep: We've all had sleep issues at some point in our life. Some for only a night or two, but we can all relate to what a bad night of sleep can do. If you don't know, ask your spouse or significant other! Many of us have either slept too much, slept too little, woke up exhausted, or found ourselves waking up multiple times a night is crucial for optimal healing, and approximately 35% of adults sleep less than 7 hours a night. Getting up early at the same time every day, regardless of what time one goes to bed, can help to regulate sleep patterns. It is also important to avoid caffeine after lunch. Toxicity: Toxicity can limit the body's ability to heal and repair itself. Too much of certain things such as added sugar, processed foods, smoking, alcohol, prescription, and non-prescription drugs, and dehydration can be toxic. It is recommended to take inventory of what one is putting into their body and exposing themselves to. Saunas, sweating, hydration, and mild sun exposure can all support the body's detoxification process. Negative outlook: Having a negative outlook can also hinder healing. Continuously speaking negatively about oneself and their situation can be detrimental. It is important to speak positively and with authority over oneself to move past any labels and to support one's healing journey.
