For instance, it points out that the milk of \"Gaumata' is known as A2 milk and that of Jersey cows is called A1 Milk. \"Gaumata produces A2 beta-casein a genetic variant of amino acid-like proline bonded with another amino acid Isoleucine, which is potent in fighting against many diseases like obesity, Joint pain, asthma, mental problems etc. Jersey cow milk is called A1 Milk,\" it reads. \"The jersey, HF etc. cows produce A1 milk where this genetic variant of beta-casein is not found. On the other hand, their milk contains a poisonous chemical named Casomorphine and due to this, it is said to be responsible for diseases like diabetes, cancer, heart disease and Asthma,\" it adds. It also says that \"Gaumata Milk\" has certain \"medical qualities and doctors advise pregnant women, kids, diabetics and heart patients to consume it\", but adds that milk from exotic cows \"should not be consumed and certainly does not reach anywhere near A2 Milk\". \"Cow Urine and Cow Dung is consumed in the form of PanchGavya. Exotic: Neither the Dung nor the Urine is consumable,\" it states. The document states that cow dung from indigenous cows produces quick and good results when used in farming, which is not the case with \"exotic\" cows. \"Milk colour is light yellow as it has traces of Gold in it. Exotic: Not found here,\" it says. Emotions and hygiene According to the reference material, Indian cow breeds (Zebu) have Suryaketu Naadi (Hump) on their shoulders. It has been known to absorb Vitamin-D from the sun rays and release it in the cow milk. \"This is the only reason as to why only Indian Cow's milk contains vitamin-D. Jersey and HF cows do not have Suryaketu Naadi,\" it says. Desi cows also display emotions, unlike exotic cows. \"Whenever any unknown person comes near desi cow, she will immediately stand. No emotions displayed by her (exotic cows),\" it adds. Moreover, Indian cows maintain hygiene too and are \"clever enough not to sit at dirty places\", says the document. \"It also adapts itself as per the climate and can withstand extreme weather. Jersey/HF cows are known to be very lazy and highly prone to diseases. It has also been seen that they attract infection by not being hygienic enough,\" it adds.
