The DHS workforce consists of more than 240,000 individuals including law enforcement agents, officers, activeduty military personnel, and men and women on the frontlines who put their lives at risk every day to protect our country from threats to the homeland, securing our land, air, and maritime borders, enforcing our immigration laws, and responding to natural disasters. These officers, members, and employees are stationed in every state and in more than 75 countries around the world. Training events and workshops are critical to bringing our geographically dispersed workforce together and ensuring that our personnel are fully equipped and prepared to carry out their missions. In order to execute our missions, and to do so in an efficient and effective manner, DHS offers significant training and technical assistance to state, local, and tribal law enforcement and first responders to build expertise and capabilities across the country. The Homeland Security Act requires the Secretary to coordinate with state and local governments, and the private sector, to ensure adequate planning, equipment, training, and exercise activities. As demonstrated during the response to recent events, including the historic flooding in South Carolina, severe storms in Texas, support during the Papal visit and the devastating typhoon in the Northern Mariana Islands, a welltrained cadre of first responders is critical to ensuring an effective response, helping to save lives, and minimize damage. Time and time again, we have also seen the value of our state, local, and tribal law enforcement training in disrupting terrorist plots and other crimes. In September 2011, the Office Management and Budget (OMB) released a memo instructing agencies to review their conference policies and internal controls to ensure they are appropriate and effective, and requiring Deputy Secretary-approval of all conference activity until the review is complete. In addition, in November 2011, the President signed an Executive Order, \"Promoting Efficient Spending,\" requiring agencies to develop plans to ensure efficient spending in several areas, including travel and Prepared by: CFO Financial Management conferences. In May 2012, OMB released a memo instructing agencies to publish a list of all agency sponsored conferences, where the net expenses exceed $100,000. In accordance with this guidance, the Department requires all Agency sponsored conference related spending above $100,000 to obtain the Chief of Staff's approval prior to obligating funds. Components request approval of proposed conferences through their Component Senior Financial Officers via memo to the Chief of Staff. The requests set forth specific cost information, including any proposed travel or meals, and demonstrates how the conference supports the DHS mission. The Chief Financial Officer reviews each proposal against DHS policy and recommends approval or disapproval before forwarding the request to the Chief of Staff for a final decision. Furthermore, DHS has conference and travel policies and controls to ensure conferences are costeffective and to ensure conference attendance is driven by critical mission requirements. These include: Responsibilities for the CFO and Component Senior Financial Officials. Requirements to use government facilities, costeffective alternatives to commercial facilities, and limiting the number of DHS attendees to conferences - consistent with the Efficiency Review travel guidance. The authority to collect conference fees from nonfederal participants, including the statutory reporting requirement. Requirements to justify, document, and report conference related expenses. Developing guidance for travel approvers to check for actions, such as use of noncontract carriers and deductions of per diem when meals are provided at conferences and reasonableness of expenses requested in the authorization process. DHS continues to realize cost savings by holding more training events locally and Components and offices continue to increase the use of video teleconferencing in lieu of in person meetings while also strengthening internal management oversight and controls. As responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars, DHS is dedicated to planning and executing DHS conferences as costeffectively as possible. We continue to monitor training events and workshops across the Department and work with Components and offices to ensure that all resources are spent responsibly and in support of critical mission requirements. During the course of the fiscal year, the Department hosted or sponsored 10 conferences where the expense to the Department exceeded $100,000 per event; these conferences totaled approximately $1.6 million.
