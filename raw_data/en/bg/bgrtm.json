IM emphasizes the therapeutic relationship and makes use of all appropriate therapies, both conventionaland alternative. 19The term ''integrative medicine'' was coined in the 1990s to encourage the integration of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) withconventional therapies to facilitate health and disease prevention. At that time, basicfoundational ingredients of well-being, such as nutrition, the mind-body connection, and spirituality, were defined as CAM. 20It has become increasingly obvious that it is difficult to define health without these basic components. As the culture of medicine evolves, IM becomes less concerned about labeling various therapies as CAM, focusing instead on developing insight into therapies that are needed to create optimal health. Making health the primary objective allows the professionals in the CAM andallopathic communities to collaborate to establish excellence in health creation (salu-togenesis) for the communities they serve (Box 1 ). In 2009, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) sponsored a Summit on Integrative Medicine and the Health of the Public.

INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE IN PRIMARY CARE: KEY INGREDIENTS Primary care is the most appropriate venue for IM. Primary care allows for continuous relationships that lead to an understanding of barriers of self-healing.

As primary care redefines itself through the patient-centered medical home model, there is an oppor- tunity for the health-oriented clinic to act as a seamless transition between the polar-ities of health and disease, moving toward the former. 23This transition requires a shift in intention toward health as a valued outcome. SALUTOGENESIS-ORIENTED SESSION In primary care, to focus more on health it is essential to create office visits that havehealth and healing as their primary goal. The term ''salutogenesis'', which means ''thecreation of health,'' was introduced by the American-Israeli medical sociologist Aaron Antonovsky, 24who was interested in exploring the origin of health than in looking for the cause of disease (pathogenesis). The investment in developing a relationship over time creates a ''context of understanding'' in which unique wellness needs of the indi-vidual are discovered and supported. With gentle and directed questioning, patients often self-discover and disclose the root cause of their symptoms, and see for them- selves what is needed for their resolution. If providers do not have time to listen, thepatient often becomes a passive recipient of treatments rather than an active partic- ipant in the healing process ( Table 1 ). HEALTH-ORIENTED TEAMS The salutogenesis-oriented session (SOS) often requires collaboration with other profes- sionals who are best suited to help guide the patient toward health in different ways.Box 1 Principles of integrative medicine /C15Patient and practitioner are partners in the healing process. /C15All factors that influence health, wellness, and disease, including mind, spirit, community, and body, are taken into consideration. /C15Appropriate use of conventional and alternative methods facilitates the body's innatehealing response. /C15Effective interventions that are natural and less invasive should be used whenever possible. /C15Good medicine is based on good science.

From Maizes V, Rakel D, Niemiec Accessed June 27, 2009.Integrative Primary Care 3Author's personal copy A team of professionals working toward the creation of health is different from the one that is focused on treating disease. Ideally, the incorporation and integration of theseteams will result in decreased need for disease-oriented teams such as those already in place to treat conditions such as renal failure, heart disease, and diabetes (Table 2 ). The creation of health-oriented teams also allows for improved access to health services that is not limited by the bottleneck of a required physician visit (Fig. 1 ). For example, a person with depression can first see a psychologist to explore the origins of depression. The psychologist can then collaborate with the primary care clinician ifmore aggressive therapy is needed. Similarly, people with abnormal lipids can see a nutritionist first and then if laboratory goals are not met, can follow up with the primary care clinician for pharmaceutical therapy. The shortage of primary care clinicians 30 demands a team-oriented approach that honors how health professionals can worktogether toward a common goal. This approach will improve care while reducing suffering and the high costs of treating diseases late in their progression. THERAPEUTIC PARTNERSHIP AND THE HEALTH AGREEMENT The therapeutic relationship is the cornerstone of integrative primary care in which patient and practitioner are partners in the healing process. Including patients asactive participants in their own medical decision making is an empowering and effec- tive way to facilitate healing. Relationship-centered care allows practitioner and patient to communicate more effectively to get to the root of the patient's concern.Table 1 Key practitioner influences for a successful salutogenesis-oriented session Practitioner Goals Reasoning/Evidence 1. Develop a trusting relationshipIt is through relationship that the patient feels comfortable expressing emotions, resulting in optimism and positive expectation3,4 2. Listen with intent and empathy tothe patient's storyBeing fully present with positive intention is perceived positively by patients and enhances the healing effects ofthe encounter. 25It is important that the patient feels understood 3. Provide an explanation for the patient's problemThe explanation makes sense of a chaotic and threatening situation resulting in an enhanced sense of control26 4. Match the explanation to the patient's culture, beliefs,and valuesMatching the explanation to the patient's own values allows for the development of insight. 8It puts the problem within a context that is accepted and createsbuy-in 9 5. The explanation is accepted by the patient, and it createsinsightAcceptance of the explanation leads to treatment and positive expectation. This results in healing, even if theexplanation is not true. 27The art of medicine is when we can reproduce this effect without deception 6. Create a plan that leads to action, empowerment,and positive expectationIf the above goals are successful, the patient will be more likely to engage in a plan that empowers her/him tomake changes that result in more sustainable effectstoward health 28,29 7. Provide support and follow-upProviding ongoing support and collaboration with other providers is the hallmark of primary care and supportsa continuous healing relationship 1,2 From Rakel D.

Explore (NY) 2008;4:42-7; with permission.Fortney et al 4Author's personal copy Good communication comes from developing rapport and empathy with the patient, which in turn supports and informs diagnosis and treatment. As the practitioner-patient relationship develops, significant health benefits ensue that have been found to improve efficiency of care by reducing dependence on exces- sive tests and referrals.5Compassionately asked, provocative, far-reaching questions about lifestyle and beliefs not only deepen the therapeutic relationship but also lead to new insights that help patients recognize for themselves which behaviors are consis- tent or inconsistent with their stated goals and values.6,7This aspect is particularly important because research suggests that psychosocial factors continue to be over- looked in the clinical setting.31,32Table 2 The health-oriented team Health Ingredient Health Professional (Examples) Nutrition Nutritionist, registered dieticianExercise and movement Exercise physiologist, yoga instructor, health coach Emotional health Psychologist, licensed social worker, mindfulness teacher Spiritual connection Chaplain, spiritual guide, pastor, rabbi, priestBehavior change Psychologist, social worker, health coachRemoving barriers Social worker, case manager, health coachTherapeutic touch Osteopath, chiropractor, massage therapist, healing touch provider, reiki practitioner Old Model New Model Health-Oriented Team Practitioner Immunization Mental Health NeedLab Test Rx Refill Acute Medical Need Chronic Disease Case Manager Behaviorist Specialist Medical Asst.

Fam Pract Manag 2008;15:32-8; with permission.Integrative Primary Care 5Author's personal copy Authentically being present with the patient and listening to their concerns can help reveal undiscovered biologic, psychological, and social factors that affect his or her health. For the clinician, being mindfully present may influence the healing process and catalyze the patient's motivation for real change. This type of therapeutic interac- tion may require additional time per visit (SOS visits may take 40-60 minutes), but it isimportant to patients and has clinical value. For example, patient-satisfaction scores directly correlate with the amount of perceived time spent with the health practi- tioner. 10In addition, how health practitioners are perceived by patients has direct effects on behavior and health outcomes. In a study by Rakel and colleagues,15 patients with common cold who perceived their physician as being more empatheticshowed significantly reduced severity and duration of cold symptoms. Another studyfound that one-third of psychiatrists treating patients with placebo were more effectivein treating depression than another one-third of psychiatrists who were treating patients with imipramine, further emphasizing the point that therapeutic presence and practice style affect health outcomes. 16Box 2 shows examples of healing- oriented questions. Health practitioners should exemplify the principles of wellness and commit them- selves to self-care. The Healthy Doctor Healthy Patient Project shows that physicianswho regularly engage themselves in physical activity are better at counseling their patients about exercise. 11Physicians' disclosures of their own healthy behaviors improve credibility and ability to motivate the patient. This aspect is especially relevant because a major challenge of clinical practice is promoting behavior change, particu- larly when one considers that 40% of all mortality stems from unhealthy behaviors, Box 2 Examples of healing-oriented questions What do you believe is the root of these symptoms? Asking ' 'what do you believe' ' (vs ' 'what do you think' ') allows for the patient to reflect on what they think is going on. Asking ' 'what do you think' ' attaches a cognitive context of right versuswrong and removes the invitation to express emotions that may not have a right answer. If this illness has created a hole within you, what do you fill this hole with? Opportunity to explore what gives the patient a sense of meaning and purpose. If anything were possible, what would your ideal life look like? Inquire about potential barriers or ingredients that give meaning to life. In a time of difficulty, whom do you turn to for support? Explore social support and sense of community. When these symptoms started, were there any stressful events happening in your life? Brings awareness of how stressful life events can be internalized causing somatic symptoms. You know yourself better than anyone. If you were your own doctor, how would you treat this condition? Provides information on what the patient believes they need most. This should be incorporated into the health plan. Listen for metaphor: You said that your job is ''eating you up inside.'' Do you feel that this is related to your abdominal pain and heartburn? Metaphor is an opportunity to bring insight into the importance of the mind-body influences on health.Fortney et al 6Author's personal copy such as smoking, alcohol use, overeating, sedentary lifestyle, and unsafe sexual prac- tices.12In a study by Frank and colleagues,33patients counseled by a physician who revealed brief information about her own healthy dietary and exercise practices, and had a bike helmet and apple visible on her desk, considered her to be healthier, more believable, and more motivating than patients in a control group who did notreceive this kind of disclosure. Considering that brief advice from a physician leads to a spontaneous quit rate of 2% to 4%, just from asking about tobacco use, it is reasonable to infer that inquiringabout other health behaviors would effect real change also. 13,14One proposal involves formal reviewing of major areas of lifestyle that promote disease prevention and well-ness with every annual physical examination. Offering brief suggestions based onpersonal and professional experience can help strengthen the therapeutic relationshipbetween practitioner and patient, and improve clinical outcomes. Reviewing a formal ''health agreement'' with patients on a yearly basis is a practical example of a harmless way to be proactive with patient-centered care that incorporates health intent into theprimary care setting. It is also important to acknowledge that ''you cannot give what you do not have.'' ''Walking the talk'' and embodying the health the practitioners encourage in theirpatients is an essential piece of integrative primary care. Every small step in the direc- tion of personal and professional wellness translates into more authentic communica- tion and relationship with the patients, which is the keystone of good medical care. To optimize a wellness-oriented, relationship-centered approach, the authors devised a Health Agreement ( Box 3 ), which is reviewed during every new patient visit, physical examination, or SOS. HOME VISITS: THE EXAMPLE OF BREAST-FEEDING Home visiting is a mutually satisfying part of an integrative practice model that canhelp strengthen the therapeutic relationship. Populations that may especially benefit include the handicapped, elderly, postpartum women, and newborns. In general, patients appreciate the personal attention and convenience of having their primarycare practitioner visit their home, and care providers also feel they gain enormousinsight into their patients' lives. 17 One of the most important benefits of having a home visit program is the optimal support of breast-feeding.34It is well known that the first 2 weeks of a newborn baby's life is a critical time for maternal-infant bonding, for learning feeding techniques and hunger cues, and for establishing an optimal milk supply, which are important for the health of the infant and the mother. Because current societal trends of bottle-feeding often leave new mothers with an insecure feeling about breast-feeding, it is important that new mothers have strong support and guidance from their physi- cians. 35The clinician can also observe the home environment to counsel the mother about how to deal with pressures, which might be separating her from her newbornduring this critical period. It is often said that the birth of a child is an opportunity for all who are involved to learn to become servants. Likewise, at the other end of the spectrum, end-of-lifecare and hospice home visits by the primary care practitioner can greatly improve the quality of patient care. These are precious times for families when the health prac- titioner can further serve the needs of the family. The clinician comes to the home toprovide supportive care and to be an encouraging advisor at the bedside of the family. This visit is a unique opportunity for a mutually satisfying patient encounter, which re- connects the health provider with beauty and meaning in the practice of medicine.Integrative Primary Care 7Author's personal copy Box 3 The Health Agreement Welcome to our clinic.

Many providers, particularly those who have been in practice for some time, have received little or no exposure to IM topics in medical school or residency. Nonetheless, patientsare increasingly interested in these approaches, and an increasing body of research findings is allowing their use to become increasingly evidence based. 36Primary care providers responsibly guide those who seek information and advise them regarding nonallopathic healing approaches. How can a provider learn more about IM? There are numerous opportunities, but it must be borne in mind that IM is, first and foremost, an overall approach or attitude toproviding care. This attitude is rooted in one's personal exploration of health and well-being, and is grounded in awareness of various forms of healing. One example of a curriculum that is designed to facilitate awareness and personal exploration is the Aware Medicine Curriculum of the University of Wisconsin Department of Family Medi-cine, which longitudinally incorporates self-care, self-reflection, and mindfulness exposure into residency training (point 4 in Box 4 ). It is also important to acknowledge that the healing arts are just as important as the medical sciences and are in fact 2 parts of the same whole, a point too often forgottenin conventional health care practice. The goal of IM is not merely to add more tools to one's practice toolbox but to refocus on holism, on relationship-centered care, and onoptimizing the healing environment as informed by both evidence-based medicine and personal experience grounded in humanism and professionalism. Medical school, residency, and fellowship training opportunities in IM are rapidly becoming more available. At least 28 medical schools have IM or CAM interest groups, and 22 schools have required coursework. Competencies in IM have also Box 4 How to learn more about IM 1. Connect with local CAM providers. It is not necessary to learn other modalities, although some providers may choose to do so. The key, as in allopathic practice, is to be able to make appropriate referrals. Who are the local health foods and supplement stores?Acupuncturists? Massage therapists? Mindfulness instructors? Chiropractors andosteopaths? Naturopathic doctors? Energy workers? These providers are often thrilled toteach others about what they do and how to collaborate. Discuss credentials, training,experience, and what disorders providers most frequently treat. 2. Build a reference library or list of Web bookmarks. The IM textbook (Rakel D, editor. Integrative medicine, 2nd edition. Philadelphia: Saunders; 2007, available online on MDConsult) is evidence based and offers numerous tools for primary care practice. Chapter 13 of this book lists numerous Web resources one can bookmark and access at the point of care. 3. Consider additional formal training. The Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine, a group of 44 academic institutions, which offer IM training in various forms, has numerous educational resources and links listed on its Web site (www.imconsortium.org ). The Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine offers providers a 2-year fellowship encompassing both residential weeks and online training (http://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/ ). The Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine offers a downloadable 202-page version of its Curriculum inIntegrative Medicine: A Guide for Medical Educators at http://www.imconsortium.org/img/ assets/20825/CURRICULUM_final.pdf . 4. Become aware of and model other academic programs that incorporate IM themes in medical education. Examples can be found at www.fammed.wisc.edu/integrative andwww. fammed.wisc.edu/aware-medicine .Integrative Primary Care 9Author's personal copy been developed.37,38To illustrate recent progress in this area, an Integrative Family Medicine grant, organized by the University of Arizona-Tucson, allowed 6 family medi- cine residency programs to create 4-year residencies or fellowships with an emphasis on IM. Moreover, opportunities for presently practicing physicians exist, including the Associate Fellowship in Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona-Tucson andweeklong review courses on IM followed by board examination held by the American Holistic Medical Association. 39In addition, the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine has an active Integrative Medicine Interest Group for faculty physicians. Instituting IM educational programming in conventional medical settings has led to increased famil- iarity with and acceptance of IM among providers and other clinic staff.18 Educating students, residents, colleagues, and patients is another key element in the role of integrative primary care provider. The authors' clinic group includes post- graduate fellows who participate in the Academic Integrative Medicine Fellowship Program. The group participates in weekly didactic sessions, which are built on a seminar and an experience-based format. Clinic providers and staff are welcometo attend various course offerings also. IM providers also hold interdisciplinary grand rounds on a monthly basis, which include formal IM education and case presentations. Both conventionally trained and CAM practitioners share their professional commentsin an open dialog with the group in a way that fosters camaraderie and shared learning. The clinicians also attend on resident teaching services, precept residents at teaching clinics, and participate in medical student clerkships. SUMMARY It is essential that health care shift its focus in the direction of prevention, patient-centered care, health-oriented medical teams, and education that includes IMbecause (1) the demand for primary care continues to increase, (2) patient populations are becoming increasingly active in various alternative and nonconventional forms of medicine, and (3) economic pressures continue to escalate unsustainably from over-use of medical technologies and primary dependence on tertiary care. Whether one is a proponent of IM or not, it is clear that the future of medical care, research, and medical education is moving in this direction. The authors propose several modelsand suggestions that can be implemented on the clinic level as well as examples ofphilosophic change that can help inform primary care redesign and positively change the way medicine is practiced in such a way that it improves patient satisfaction, lowers health care cost with emphasis on prevention through wellness, and is basedon more patient-practitioner relationship guided treatment options.
