Facial acupuncture is an excellent supplement or alternative to procedures such as cosmetic surgery or botox injections. We use two approaches simultaneously in our treatment. The first of which utilizes the principle of Traditional Chinese Medicine: \"treatment of the whole body\". This involves improving overall health and restoring balance to the body. We believe it is necessary to work from the inside (the underlying causes) when dealing with the skin (face). The second approach involves local treatment. This is done by stimulating circulation of the blood and Qi to tone the muscles underneath the skin. The Benefits of Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture: - Reduces fine lines and diminishes deep wrinkles on the face - Firms and reduces bags under the eyes - Improves muscle tone and tautness of skin - Helps to eliminate puffiness - Improving facial color - Reduces stress and promotes overall health and well-being The recommended course of treatment is 10 -12 sessions, to be performed 1-2 times a week. Each treatment lasts about 45-60 minutes. Maintenance is recommended once every 4-6 weeks. ACM Center Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture Program: A. Facial Acupuncture Treatments: A series of 10-12 treatments should be completed within 7-9 weeks, with 2 treatments per week for first 3 weeks, and then 1 treatment per week for the remaining 4-6 weeks. - Initial consultation visit includes health history and evaluation. The evaluation will determine if the person was a proper candidate. A good proper candidate would be one in general good health. We suggest the severe chronic health condition should be addressed and corrected before starting Facial Acupuncture treatments. A personalized facial care plan will be formulated and discussed. - Regular and Maintenance treatment takes 45-60 minutes. B. Chinese Herbs and Dietary Advice Based on the individual's body energy patterns, Chinese herbs, nutritional supplements, and dietary advice will be given to rebalance and improve general and skin health.
