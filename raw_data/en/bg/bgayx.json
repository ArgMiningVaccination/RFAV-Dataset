Introduction Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) raises muchpublicandprofessionalinterestandthepredictionsarethat CAM will become even more popular in the future. Inthe United States the CAM usage in the general populationhas risen from 33% in 1990 to 42% in 1997 [1]. In the UK thisnumberissmaller(20%in1999)butalsoincreasing [2]. The reason people turn to CAM are diverse, one is dissat-isfaction with areas of the mainstream medicine, includingimmunisation. Immunisation is presently a highly controversial topic. Many CAM practitioners are supporters of the 'anti-vaccination movement'. The measles, mumps and rubellavaccination programme (MMR) has been of recent concernamong professionals, parents and the general public. Thisconcern was caused by claims that the MMR vaccinationcould be related to autism, Crohn's disease and inflamma-tory bowel disease [3]. As a consequence, rates of MMR vaccination fell from 92% in 1996-1997 to 88% in 1998[4]. In a survey for BBC Radio 5 Live, more than half of Corresponding author. Tel.: +44-1392-424-839; fax:+44-1392-424-989. E-mail address: katja.schmidt@pms.ac.uk (K. Schmidt).GPs surgeries reported uptake of the MMR vaccine had fallen [5]. Anti-vaccination groups and campaigns are gaining sup- port, particularly in the USA and Western Europe [6]. Chi- ropractors, homeopaths and naturopaths often advise [7]. In a survey investigating US chiropractors' attitudes, one-third agreed that there isno scientic proof that immunisation prevents disease andthat vaccinations cause more disease than they do prevent[8]. In an Australian survey 83% of all Sydney homeopaths did not recommend immunisation [9]and a German survey found that active immunisations against the 'classic child-hooddiseases',includingMMRareusedwithmorerestraintamong homeopathic physicians [10]. In another study of 117 Austrian homeopaths only 33 homeopaths rated im-munisation as an important preventive procedure [11]. The chiropractic profession has also repeatedly expressed theirnegative view on vaccination [12]. The reasons for this are complex and rooted in the early philosophy of theseapproaches to healthcare. The early chiropractic philoso-phy considered most diseases to be a result of spinal nervedysfunction caused by misplaced vertebrae. A minority ofchiropractors is still accepting this concept [13]. On this background, the purpose of this survey was to investigate what advice UK homeopaths, chiropractors andgeneral practitioners give regarding MMR vaccination. 0264-410X/02/$ - see front matter \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Method All e-mail addresses listed in UK practitioner referral directories online and private websites were extracted.Homeopaths' e-mail addresses we found at http://www. homeopath.co.uk/directory and private homepages. were extracted from http://www.internetgp.com/ gpsites/alphabet.htm . We also intended to involve natur- opaths. However, no database for UK naturopaths wasaccessible. Thus, only homeopaths, chiropractors and GPswere chosen. All practitioners thus identied received the same query about MMR immunisation from a mother hesitating to givethe MMR vaccine to her baby daughter ( Appendix A ). Af- ter 2 weeks of data collection (spring 2002), all respondentswere informed that they had received an e-mail from a c-titious patient, as part of a research project. Condential-ity was assured, the intention of the project was explainedand all participants were given the option of withdrawingfrom the project at this stage. Consent was implied througha non-response to the follow-up e-mail ( Appendix B ). The following criteria were applied for evaluation of the remaining data: (1) Do practitioners respond to requests forvaccinationadvicebye-mail?(2)Dotherespondentsadvisein favour of vaccination? (3) Are there statistically signi-cant differences between the three groups regarding the na-ture of the advice given? Responses were categorised into(a) advising to have MMR (positive response), (b) advisingnot to have MMR (negative response), (c) indirectly advis-ing to have MMR (for instance, using phrases, such as \"IfI had a child I would probably sway towards vaccinating itusing the MMR vaccine\") (positive response), (d) indirectlyadvising not to have MMR (for instance, stressing that ownchildren were not vaccinated, or using phrases, such as \"inprinciple I am against inoculation\" or \"I would most likelylook at alternatives to vaccination\") (negative response), (e)advising to obtain as much information as possible (neutralresponse), (f) no advice (neutral response) and (g) advis-ing to have separate vaccinations for measles, mumps andrubella. Our local ethics committee gave ethical approval tothe protocol of the project in April 2002. The responses were analysed independently by two blinded researchers. 2analyses were employed to sta- Table 1 Professional group Response rate (%) Withdrawal rate (%) Advise to immunisea(%) Advise not to immunisea(%) Homeopaths ( n= 168) 31/77 (40) Chiropractors ( n= 63) 22 (44) 6 (27) 4/16 (25) 3/16 (19) General practitioners ( n= 111) 0 (0) NAbNA NA aDirectly or indirectly (of those who responded and did not withdraw). bNA: not applicable.tistically assess differences between groups using SPSS statistical software. 3. Results One hundred and sixty eight e-mail addresses of home- opaths were contacted ( Table 1). Of the 144 e-mails that were delivered we received 104 responses (response rate = 72%). Of those, one response arrived at a date beyond thedeadline. Twenty-seven homeopaths (26%) wished to with-draw from the project after being debriefed about its na-ture. Of the 77 participating homeopaths, none advised themother in favour of the MMR vaccination for her daughter,3(4%)openlyadvisedagainsttheMMRvaccination,2(3%)homeopaths indirectly advised to get the MMR, 28 (36%)indirectly advised not to have the MMR, 22 (29%) advisedthemothertoobtainasmuchinformationaspossiblebeforedeciding, 14 (18%) gave no advice but offered their tele-phone number or a consultation with another homeopath,5 (7%) advised to get individual vaccines and two home-opaths (3%) suggested neither to have the MMR nor anyhomeopathic vaccine but to treat the illnesses individuallywith a homeopathic remedy when they occur. Twenty-onedifferent websites were recommended for further informa-tion. Sixty-three e-mails to chiropractors were sent out, of which50weredelivered.Wereceivedatotalof22responses(responserate44%).Sixchiropractors(27%)withdrewtheirresponse. One chiropractor (6%) recommended getting theMMR vaccination, three (19%) indirectly advised not tohave MMR, three (19%) more indirectly advised having theMMR and a further three (19%) advised to obtain as muchinformation as possible before making a decision. Five chi-ropractors (31%) gave no advice and one (6%) suggestedgetting individual vaccines. Three websites were suggestedby chiropractors for further information. We sent e-mails to 111 GPs, of which one message was returned. We received no responses from GPs. We thereforedecided to send the same letter to National Health Service(NHS) Direct and received the following reply \" ...(we)are unable to provide advice on the MMR vaccine. We are ableto give general information about the vaccine from accred-ited public health websites only. We cannot advise you onsingle dose vaccines ,or where to obtain them .\" NHS Direct recommended four websites for more information.1046 K. Schmidt, E. Ernst/Vaccine 21 (2003) 1044-1047 Using 2-testtocompareresponsesbetweenhomeopaths and chiropractors, we distinguished between positive andnegative attitudes towards MMR. There was no signicantdifference in negative attitudes between responses from chi-ropractors and homeopaths, X 2(1,n=92)=1.74 ( X2(1,n=92)=10.18 Signicantly more chiropractors displayed a positive attitude towards MMR vaccination. 4. Discussion None of the practitioners involved in this study can be seen as representative of any organisation nor are they rep-resentative of their profession. When visiting websites ofhomeopaths' and chiropractors' organisations, no policystatements for guiding parents on the vaccination debatewere found. Our results conrm previous observations [5]that some CAM providers advise their patients against immunisation.The conclusiveness of our ndings is limited by the smallsample sizes and the low response rates. The sample sizesweredeterminedbythenumberofe-mailaddresseswewereable to locate. The response rates were reduced through theoption of withdrawal, which we felt was an ethical imper-ative. Initially, homeopaths showed a good response rate(72%)comparedtochiropractors(44%).Thesegureswerereduced to 53 and 32%, respectively, through subsequentwithdrawals. Remarkably, GPs unanimously abstained fromadvising over the Internet, which resulted in a response rateof zero. No homeopath and only one chiropractor directlyadvisedinfavouroftheMMRvaccination.Twohomeopathsand three chiropractors indirectly advised in favour of theMMR. More chiropractors displayed a positive attitude to-ward the MMR when compared to homeopaths. We are keenly aware of the fact that this study raises im- portant ethical issues, it represents research on human sub-jects without informed consent. In order to minimise ourethical dilemma we fully debriefed all participants after re-sponses had been received. This step does not, however, en-tirely solve the ethical problem of not obtaining informedconsent. Informed consent would have rendered this projectimpossible. We (and our ethics committee) felt that identi-fying a potential safety issue in the interest of public healthhad sufcient potential benet to outweigh the small risk,namelywastingpractitionerstimeoralienatingthem.Infact,several respondents were appreciative of our project and ac-cepted that it might contribute to participants' re-thinkingtheir position on the MMR-vaccine and the nature of anyadvice given on the Internet. Others felt that a study such asours could help CAM professions to be more accepted andtoobtainabetterstatusinhealthcare.Unfortunately,wealsoreceived three ofcial complaints about our investigation. If one accepts, rstly, that MMR vaccination does more goodthanharmand,secondly,thatsomeCAMprovidersarean obstacle in obtaining this net benet, one must consider ways of changing the attitude of such practitioners. Obvi-ously, this is much easier said than done. We believe thata strategy to achieve this aim should include a rational andopen debate about the pros and contras of immunisation inthe chiropractic and homeopathic literature. Moreover, themedia would have an important role to play in objectivelyinforming both, the general public and the growing popula-tion of CAM providers on the potential risks and benets of(MMR) vaccination. In conclusion, our study has conrmed previous inves- tigations, suggesting that some CAM providers have anegative attitude towards immunisation, specically MMR.With the raising popularity of CAM this could amount to amajor threat to public health. Ways of rationally debatingthe issues with proponents of CAM should therefore befound. Acknowledgements Katja Schmidt was supported by The Pilkington Family Trusts. Appendix A Dear homeopath/chiropractor/GP, My 1 year old daughter is coming up for MMR vaccina- tion but I am not sure whether she should have the MMRat all. I want the best for her but there is so much about itin the news at the moment. My friend has been told by hertherapist better not to get the MMR for her son. Can I askyour advice? Should I go ahead with the MMR, should Itry separate vaccination or should I not vaccinate at all? Orperhaps, is there an alternative to vaccination? I would very much appreciate your opinion.Best wishes, Laura Phillips. Appendix B Dear homeopath/chiropractor/GP, A few weeks ago you received an e-mail from a young mother asking you for advice on vaccination for the im-munisation of her child. The patient 'query' you receivedwas part of a research project investigating homeopaths'/chiropractors'/GPs' responses to this vignette. The aim ofthe project carried out by the Department of Complemen-tary Medicine, University of Exeter is to investigate whatsort of MMR advice is given via the Internet and to publishthe results in a scientic peer-reviewed journal. This studyis part of a wider research project about the safety of Inter-net advice and our protocol has received ethical approval byan independent ethics committee. You can rest assured that condentiality will be strictly observed and that at no stage will your identity be disclosedK. Schmidt, E. Ernst/Vaccine 21 (2003) 1044-1047 1047 to anyone outside this research project. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to send me anothere-mail. This e-mail is a follow-up, asking you retrospectively for your informed consent. If we may use your original re-sponse you do not need to reply to this. We will then as-sume you agree. However, if you would like to withdrawfrom the study please reply to this e-mail and state that youwould like to withdraw, in which case we will exclude yourresponse from the report and completely remove it fromour records. Responses received 14 days after we have sentthe original e-mail will be discarded and counted as non-responses. Thank you very much for your understanding.Best wishes, Katja Schmidt.
