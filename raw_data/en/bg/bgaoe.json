Poor prognosis in BC patients is often linked to drug resistance as well as the lack of effective therapeutic options for metastatic and triple-negative BC. In response to these unmet needs, extensive research efforts have been devoted to exploring the anti-BC potentials of natural products owing to their multi-target mechanisms of action and good safety profiles. Various medicinal plant extracts/essential oils and natural bioactive compounds have demonstrated anti-cancer activ - ities in preclinical BC models. Despite the promising preclinical results, however, the clinical translation of natural products has often been hindered by their poor stability, aqueous solubility and bioavailability. There have been attempts to overcome these limitations, particularly via the use of nano-based drug delivery systems (NDDSs). This review high - lights the tumour targeting mechanisms of NDDSs, the advantages and disadvantages of the major classes of NDDSs and their current clinical status in BC treatment. Besides, it also discusses the proposed anti-BC mechanisms and nanoformulations of nine medicinal plants' extracts/essential oils and nine natural bioactive compounds; selected via the screening of various scientific databases, including PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar, based on the following keywords: \"Natural Product AND Nanoparticle AND Breast Cancer\". Overall, these nanoformulations exhibit improved anti-cancer efficacy against preclinical BC models, with some demonstrating biocompatibility with normal cell lines and mouse models. Further clinical studies are, however, warranted to ascertain their efficacy and biocompatibility in humans. Keywords: breast cancer, drug delivery, molecular mechanisms, nanoparticles, natural products, phytomedicine Introduction Breast cancer (BC) has been recognised as a global health issue, as it is the most common type of cancer and the major cause of cancer death in women.1 In 2020, BC recorded high global incidence (2,261,419 cases) and mortality (684,996 deaths) rates.2 Advancements in technology mammography, positron emission tomo - graphy) have enabled the early detection of BC.3 Nevertheless, approximately 30% of patients with early-stage BC eventually relapse with metastases.4,5 Metastatic BC is considered to be largely incurable, with a 5-year survival rate of only 26% despite currently available treatment Neeraj Yap et al.

Different BC subtypes exhibit distinct bio - logical features, with variabilities in their prognosis and treatment response.8 In particular, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with worse prog - nosis, more aggressive behaviour, lack of validated molecular targets and limited therapeutic options (ie, chemotherapy), thereby rendering its management challenging.9,10A multimodal approach is often employed for BC treatment, whereby a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, HER2-targeted therapy or chemother - apy may be included in the treatment plan depending on the stage and subtype of BC as well as the tolerance of patients.11 Table 1 summarises the typical systemic ther - apeutic options for the three major BC subtypes.12,13 However, there have been reports of resistance to endo - crine therapy, HER2-targeted therapy and chemotherapy clinically.14 Both drug resistance and the lack of effective therapeutic options for metastatic BC and TNBC represent the major obstacles in treating BC. Therefore, BC remains a medical area with unmet needs and has attracted Graphical Abstract https: //doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S328135 Dove Press International Journal of Nanomedicine 2021:16 7892Yap et al Dove press Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)researches into the discovery of novel anti-BC drugs that offer higher efficacy with minimal toxicity. Historically, different forms of natural products (eg, oils, potions, remedies and traditional medicines) have been used to treat various diseases and injuries.15 The medicinal proper - ties of natural products have subsequently attracted attention into identifying the bioactive compound(s) of interest, mak - ing natural products a vital source for drug discovery in various therapeutic areas, especially in cancer and infectious diseases.16 For instance, the majority (>60%) of clinically available anti-cancer drugs are natural product-derived.17 Of these drugs, paclitaxel topotecan and irinotecan from Camptotheca acuminata represent some of the most effective chemother - apeutic agents in clinics.17 There was a decline in the pursuit of natural product-based drug discovery by the pharmaceu - tical industry in the 1990s, mainly due to challenges in high- throughput screening, bioactive compound identification and synthesis as well as lead optimisation.16 However, recent technological advancements have helped to address these challenges and thereby revitalised the industry's interest to re-explore natural products as a potential source of new drugs.16 Natural products are often tested for desired bioactivities in the form of extracts.18 Extracts demonstrating the bioactivity of interest are then subjected to fractionation for the isolation and identification of bioactive compound(s).18 Plants, in parti - cular, represent a natural source that has been heavily explored for their anti-cancer potentials.19 Studies have reported anti- cancer activities of various plant extracts and isolated phyto - chemicals, which are the biologically active non-nutritive plant chemicals, in preclinical BC models.20,21 More recently, studies have also suggested the potential of using essential oils to treat various cancers, including BC.22,23 Essential oils, which are produced and secreted by specialised secretory structures of plants, are complex mixtures of lipophilic and volatile plant secondary metabolites.24,25 Natural extracts, essential oils and their bioactive compounds are known to exhibit multi-target mechanisms of action with minimal side effects, of which would be advantageous for cancer treatment.22,26 Figure 1 Stages and subtypes of breast cancer.

Thereafter, the anti-BC mechanisms of selected natural products (includ - ing extracts, essential oils and natural bioactive com - pounds) and their nanoformulations that have demonstrated preclinical anti-BC activities are discussed. The Tumour Targeting Mechanisms of Nano-Based Drug Delivery Systems NDDSs represent a rapidly developing area of science, where nanoscale materials are utilised as carriers for deli - vering drugs to their sites of action.32 The use of NDDSs for drug delivery can enhance the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs, enable the co-delivery of multiple drugs, provide targeted drug delivery, protect normal cells from drug toxicity and prolong drug action.32-34 Targeted drug delivery to tumours is of the utmost impor - tance to enhance the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs while minimising their systemic toxicity, and it may be achieved by NDDSs via passive and active targeting mechanisms (Figure 2 ).35,36 The Passive Tumour Targeting Mechanism Passive tumour targeting generally depends on a phenom - enon called the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect.33 Tumour angiogenesis is stimulated in response to the needs of tumours for nutrients, oxygen and waste excretion.37 However, the new tumour vasculature exhibits both structural and functional abnormalities.37 For instance, the newly formed blood vessels surrounding tumours are leaky (with pore sizes ranging from 100 nm to 2 \u00b5M), thus allowing for enhanced permeation of NDDSs.38 Moreover, tumours also lack normal lymphatic drainage system, leading to enhanced retention of these NDDSs.38 Overall, the EPR effect can improve the speci - ficity of drug delivery to tumours over normal tissues by approximately 20-30%.33 However, NDDSs must (1) have reasonable stability in the blood circulation and (2) be able to avoid clearance by the reticuloendothelial system (RES) and sequestration by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) in order to reach the tumours and achieve the EPR effect.39 These two challenges have specifically been addressed via the PEGylation of NDDSs, which can improve their hydrophilicity and decrease their immunogenicity.33T able 1 Systemic Therapeutic Options for Three Major Breast Cancer Subtypes + patients -Used in all patients[12,13] https: //doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S328135 Dove Press International Journal of Nanomedicine 2021:16 7894Yap et al Dove press Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)The Active Tumour Targeting Mechanism Following the tumour accumulation of NDDSs through the EPR effect, drug efficiency can be further improved via active tumour targeting.33 Active tumour targeting is achieved by binding on the NDDS surface of any ligands that interact with receptors that are overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells.39 This action increases the affinity of NDDSs for cancer cells and may enhance their uptake by cancer cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis.33,40 Interestingly, NDDSs have also cancer therapy. The Major Classes of Nano-Based Drug Delivery Systems Evaluated for Breast Cancer Therapy The use of NDDSs for cancer therapy is promising, as NDDSs have demonstrated potentials in enhancing the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs, reducing their toxicity to normal cells and overcoming drug resistance.43 NDDSs can generally be grouped into three different categories, namely organic, inorganic and hybrid (made of 2 types of nanomaterials) NDDSs.33 Several major classes of NDDSs have been investigated for the delivery of anti-BC agents44 (Figure 3 ). Each of these NDDS classes is associated with certain advantages and disadvantages ( Table 2 ), thus reflecting the importance of selecting the most appropriate delivery system for a particular drug. The Organic Nano-Based Drug Delivery Systems The Carbon-Based Nanocarriers The capability of carbon atoms to undergo sp-, sp2- and sp3-hybridisation explains the existence of multiple carbon allotropes.45 In addition to the three naturally occurring carbon allotropes (ie, amorphous carbon, diamond and graphite), several synthetic carbon allotropes (eg, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanocones, carbon nanohorns, fuller - ene, graphene and nanodiamond) have also been developed.45 In recent years, carbon-based nanocarriers have been extensively exploited for different biomedical Figure 2 Passive and active targeting mechanisms of nano-based drug delivery systems to tumours.

This nanoformulation is also capable of releasing epirubicin slowly in the lymph nodes, which may prolong its chemotherapeutic action. Further development of carbon-based nanocarriers is, how - ever, often hindered by controversies surrounding their inher - ent toxicities.48 The Dendrimers Dendrimers are three-dimensional - cules are characterised by their well-organised and highly branched structures.50 A typical dendrimer consists of a symmetric central core, together with an inner shell and an outer shell.51 The precise molecular weight, bio - compatibility, monodispersity, high aqueous solubility, high biological barrier penetrability and polyvalency of dendrimers have contributed to their extensive biomedical Figure 3 Major classes of nano-based drug delivery systems for breast cancer therapy.

tion, adsorption, bioavailability, stability and efficacy of drugs as well as enable controlled drug release and tar - geted drug delivery.52,53 Various types of dendrimers have been investigated as drug carriers in oncology, including cationic dendrimers often confer high toxicity.56 Cationic dendrimers tend to interact with negatively charged biological membranes, which can consequently lead to membrane integrity disruption, cytosolic protein leakage and eventually cell lysis.50 It has been reported that the surface modification of dendrimers (eg, PEGylation) can mask their charge(s) A PEGylated PLL dendrimer-based nanoformulation of docetaxel demonstrated superiority over conventional docetaxel in terms of efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics in the Phase I trial, in which patients with advanced brain, breast, cervical, gastro-oesophageal, lung, pancreatic, prostate and renal cancers were enrolled.57 Based on the positive Phase I results, nanoformulated docetaxel has been advanced to Phase II.57 Similarly, a PEGylated PLL dendrimer-based nanoformulation of SN-38 has also pro - gressed to Phase II following the observation of improved anti-cancer efficacy and safety as compared to conven - tional irinotecan in breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients in the Phase I component of its attracted consider - able attention in drug delivery owing to their ease of preparation, large-scale and low-cost production, biocom - patibility, biodegradability, targetability, high stability and high drug loading capacity.59,60 Additionally, they can also prolong drug action by enabling controlled drug release and extending drug half-life.60 Lipid-based nanocarriers are particularly considered to have revolutionised cancer treatment, as they have been reported to improve the efficacies of anti-cancer drugs as well as reduce their therapeutic doses, associated toxicities and drug resistance.60 Liposomes are the first generation of lipid-based nano - carriers developed for drug delivery.61 They are spherical lipid vesicles consisting of an aqueous core that is sur - rounded by at least one phospholipid bilayer.62 Due to the amphipathic nature of phospholipids, liposomes are cap - able of loading both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs into the lipid bilayer and the aqueous internal compart - ments, respectively.59,61 In 1995, PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, making it the first FDA-approved nanomedicine.63 It is currently also indicated for the clin - ical treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer, metastatic BC and multiple myeloma.64 In all settings, PEGylated lipo - somal doxorubicin has reduced cardiotoxicity in comparison to free doxorubicin.63 Liposomal cytarabine obtained FDA approval for the intrathecal treatment of lymphomatous meningitis in 1999.65 Since then, a number of clinical trials have been underway to establish the effectiveness of liposomal cytarabine in other cancer types.66 It was found in a Phase III trial that systemic therapy plus intrathecal liposomal cytarabine resulted in better median progression-free survival than systemic ther - apy alone (3.8 vs 2.2 months) in BC patients with newly diagnosed leptomeningeal metastasis.67 Nonetheless, the development of liposomal nanoformulation is limited by difficulties with large-scale manufacturing, stability.68 Niosomes are spherical vesicles with closed bilayer structures that arise from the self-clustering of cholesterol and non-ionic surfactants in aqueous media.59 They have similar structures and physical-chemical properties as lipo - somes, and can also load both hydrophobic and hydrophi - lic drugs.68,69 In contrast to liposomes, however, niosomes require simpler fabrication methods, lower production costs and possess greater stability.68 Therefore, niosomes have been proposed as an alternative to liposomal delivery of anti-cancer drugs.59 Niosomal nanoformulations of cisplatin,70 doxorubicin71 and tamoxifen citrate72 have been reported to possess higher anti-cancer efficacy than their free drugs in preclinical BC models, but none of these has been advanced to clinical trials to date. One disadvantage of niosomes is that their currently International Journal of Nanomedicine 2021:16 https: //doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S328135 Dove Press 7899Dove press (www.tcpdf.org) Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)commercially available non-ionic surfactants (ie, Spans and Tweens) are all polydisperse.69 SLNs, a relatively new colloidal drug delivery system, are made of lipid matrices that remain in a solid state at physiological temperatures.60 Similar to liposomes and niosomes, SLNs are also capable of incorporating both hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs.60 However, they are superior to liposomes in terms of reproducibility, feasibil - ity of large-scale stability and ciency for hydrophobic drugs.73 Although no SLN-based nanoformulation of anti-cancer drugs has been clinically studied for BC treatment to date, there have been precli - nical reports of the anti-BC activities paclitaxel-76 and tamoxifen-77 loaded SLNs. However, SLNs are associated with several draw - backs, including low drug loading capacity and risk of drug expulsion due to crystallisation during storage.78 The Polymer-Based Nanocarriers In general, polymer-based nanocarriers are able to protect drugs from rapid metabolism and clearance by RES, liver and kidney as well as offer targeted delivery and sustained release of drugs.79 They can be prepared from either natural or synthetic polymers.80 As opposed to natural polymers, synthetic polymers are abundantly present, pos - sess better thermal stability and mechanical properties and can be more easily processed to achieve desired pore size and scaffold geometry.81 However, synthetic polymers often come with impurities that can affect their biocompat - ibility, while natural polymers generally offer better bio - compatibility and biodegradability.82 In recent years, semi- synthetic polymers, which are derived from the modifica - tion of natural polymers via blending, crosslinking or grafting with synthetic polymers, have been introduced.82 They exhibit combined advantageous properties of both natural and synthetic polymers and thus are a highly pro - mising type of nanomaterial for drug delivery.81 Polysaccharides represent a class of natural polymer that has been extensively exploited for drug delivery.83 They can be obtained naturally from algal (eg, alginate), (eg, chitosan, chondroitin and hyaluronic arabic) (eg, dextran and hyaluronic acid have been most frequently utilised for delivering anti-cancer drugs.83 Various synthetic polymers have also been exploited for the preparation of NDDSs, including hydrophobic poly - mers such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly (lactic acid) (PLA) and polycaprolactone (PCL) as well as hydrophilic polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(glutamic acid) (PGA), nanoformulations of various chemother - apeutic agents have also been clinically tested for BC treat - ment. In a Phase III trial, a monomethoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(D,L-lactide) (mPEG-PDLLA) micellar formulation of paclitaxel was found to offer superior clinical efficacy (ie, objective response rate of 39.1% vs 24.3%) and manageable toxicities in comparison to conventional pacli - taxel in patients with recurrent or metastatic HER2-negative BC.87 This micellar formulation of paclitaxel is now on the South Korean market for treating metastatic BC, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ovarian cancer.88 Another nanoformulation, PGA-paclitaxel, has also been evaluated in Phase II trials for the treatment of BC, NSCLC and ovarian cancer.89 Specifically, a Phase II trial reported that the com - bination of PGA-paclitaxel plus capecitabine showed signif - icant reasonable tolerability in metastatic BC patients.90 Notably, PGA-paclitaxel have been advanced to Phase III trials for the treatment of NSCLC and advanced ovarian cancer.89 The Protein-Based Nanocarriers Protein-based nanocarriers consist of multiple protein sub - units that can undergo spontaneous and precise self-asso - ciation to form nanocarriers with internal hollow cavities.91 Over the past few years, there has been a rapid expansion in the practical applications (eg, biocata - lysis, diagnostic imaging, drug delivery and vaccine devel - opment) of protein-based nanocarriers owing to their unique properties.92 In addition to being biocompatible and biodegradable, protein-based nanocarriers also offer other advantages such as ease of synthesis and size con - trol, cost-effectiveness, high stability, amenability to sur - face modification for targeted drug delivery and ability to provide controlled drug release.93,94 However, nanocar - riers derived from different proteins have been associated with certain disadvantages such as high cost (eg, albumin and ferritin), risk of prion transmission from animal sources (eg, collagen and gelatin), low mechanical strength (eg, gelatin), slow degradation (eg, silk protein fibroin), fast degradation (eg, gelatin and gliadin), gliadin) yield (eg, legumin, protamine and silk protein sericin).93,94 The most extensive use of protein-based nanocarriers as NDDSs has been seen in oncology. There has been a https: //doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S328135 Dove Press International Journal of Nanomedicine 2021:16 7900Yap et al Dove press Powered by TCPDF Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)heavy focus particularly on albumin nanocarriers, as albu - min has been reported to preferentially accumulate in solid tumours.95 For example, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel that demonstrated greater anti-cancer efficacy and lower toxicity than conventional paclitaxel in both preclinical and clinical studies successfully obtained FDA approval for the treatment of metastatic BC in 2005.96,97 In a Phase I trial, nanoparticle albumin-bound rapamycin also showed preliminary evidence of response and stable disease as well as acceptable tolerability in patients with advanced non-hematologic cancers, includ - ing BC.98 It is currently being tested in Phase II trials, either alone or in combination with other therapies, for the treatment of various cancers such as high-grade glioma, newly diagnosed glioblastoma99 and advanced malignant perivascular epithelioid cell tumour.100 The Inorganic Nano-Based Drug Delivery Systems The Metallic Nanoparticles Metallic nanoparticles are colloidal particles with diameters ranging from 10 to 1000 nm.101 They are known for their unique catalytic, electrical, magnetic, optical and thermal properties, simple surface chemistry and functionalisation as well as ease of synthesis.102 These features have led to the extensive investigation of metallic nanoparticles in a wide range of biomedical applications (eg, diagnostic testing, ima - ging, radiotherapy enhancement, thermal ablation as well as gene and drug delivery), rendering them multi-purpose.102 Metallic nanoparticles are associated with both intrin - sic and extrinsic anti-cancer effects.102 For instance, sev - eral metallic nanoparticles (eg, silver, gold, cerium oxide, copper oxide, iron oxide, titanium oxide, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) have been reported to mediate intrinsic anti-cancer activities via different mechanisms.103,104 The extrinsic anti-cancer activities of metallic nanoparticles are seen in targeted hyperthermic therapy.105 For example, a thermal therapy product based on iron oxide nanoparticles has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to treat glioblastoma.106 Following the direct injec - tion of aqueous iron oxide nanoparticle dispersion into the tumour, an alternating magnetic field is applied to generate heat for killing the cancer cells.106 Besides being useful as anti-cancer agents, metallic nano - particles can also be utilised as NDDSs for anti-cancer drugs. They have high drug loading capacity and possess a large surface area-to-volume ratio that facilitates chemical modification.107 Moreover, superparamagnetic metallic nano - particles (eg, iron oxide) can also enable site-specific delivery of drugs via the application of an external magnetic field.108 A metallic nanoformulation, colloidal gold-bound tumour necro - sis factor, has completed Phase I trials in patients with different cancers, including BC.109 It could be administered at doses that exceeded the maximum tolerated dose of native tumour necrosis factor while showing reasonable tolerability and tumour targetability.110 However, some metallic nanoparticles have been associated with toxicities even though the metals used are relatively inert (eg, gold, silver and copper), as well as with low stability and biocompatibility.39,111 ordered porosity of 2 to 50 nm in diameter.112 They have emerged as an ideal NDDS owing to their unique properties, including simple fabrication, tunable particle size and shape, large internal pore volume and surface area giving rise to high drug loading capacity, good stability, good bio - compatibility, easy surface modification and functionalisation as well as capability to incorporate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs.112-115 The first introduction of MSNs as NDDSs dates back to 2001 when Vallet-Reg\u00ed et al116 successfully encapsu - lated an anti-inflammatory drug (ie, ibuprofen) into MSNs. Considerable research efforts have since been devoted to the development of MSNs for treating various diseases, particularly cancer.113 MSN-based nanoformulations the clinical transla - tion of MSNs may be limited by its reported toxicities (eg, cardiotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, renal toxicity and genotoxicity).121-123 The Anti-Breast Cancer Mechanisms of Medicinal Plant Extracts/Essential Oils and Anti-Breast Cancer Activities of Their Nanoformulations in Preclinical Models Extracts/essential oils of certain medicinal plants contain a cocktail of bioactive compounds that exert anti-BC activ - ities via different mechanisms of action ( Table 3 ).

They have been used by humans as ornamental plants, arsenic hyper - accumulators, food, spices and medicines.134,135 Importantly, Pteris is known to be rich in ent-kaurane diterpenoids, a compound class whose members often possess good anti-cancer activity.135 For example, Pteris quadriaurita (striped brake fern) has been reported to exhibit anti-cancer activity136 in addition to anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-haemolytic and antioxidant activities.137 The methanolic both A. capillus-veneris and P . quadriaurita have demonstrated anti-cancer activ - ities against BC cell lines.136 In the same study, the researchers synthesised gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) from these extracts and evaluated the effects of the resulting AuNPs on MCF-7 and BT-47 BC cell lines. Only P. quadriaurita AuNPs were found to possess greater cyto - toxicity against MCF-7 cells than its free extract (IC 50 values of 9 \u00b5g/mL vs 380 \u00b5g/mL). Nonetheless, subse - quent gene and protein expression analyses revealed that MCF-7 and BT-47 cells treated with A. capillus-veneris and P. quadriaurita AuNPs had a more significant Table 3 (Continued).

A more significant reduction in the mRNA and protein levels of cyclin D1 and the protein level of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4, as well as a more significant increase in the mRNA level of p21 (ie, a CDK inhibitor) and the protein level of nuclear p21 relative to cytosolic p21 were also observed. Moreover, both A. capillus-veneris and P. quadriaurita extracts and their AuNPs also induced apoptosis in MCF-7 and BT-47 cells, as evidenced by a significant increase in the number of TUNEL- and Annexin V-positive cells. Apoptosis was further confirmed to be mediated by the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as indicated by a drop in mitochondrial membrane potential ( m); a significant increase in the mRNA and protein levels of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax; ie, a pro-apoptotic protein) and the protein levels of caspase-9 (ie, an initiator caspase of the relative to mitochondrial cyto - chrome c; as well as a significant decrease in the mRNA and protein levels of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2; ie, an anti-apoptotic protein). Importantly, AuNPs induced greater changes in the expression of the abovementioned apoptotic markers than their free extracts. Taken together, these findings suggest that the formulation of A. capillus- veneris and P . quadriaurita extracts into AuNPs can improve their anti-proliferative, cell cycle arrest-inducing and pro-apoptotic activities against BC cells. The Annona muricata Extracts Annona muricata is a fruit tree widely cultivated in the tropical regions of Central and South America, Western, Central and Eastern Africa as well as Southeast Asia.138 It is known by a range of common names at different places, including Soursop (English), Guan\u00e1bana (Latin American Spanish), Graviola (Portuguese) and Omusitafeli/Ekitafeli (Uganda).138 Traditionally, different parts of A. muricata such as fruits, leaves, seeds, flowers, bark and roots have been used to treat cancer, diabetes, malaria, parasitic infec - tions and stomach ache, etc.138,139 More recent studies have discovered various pharmacological activities of In particular, extracts prepared from A. muricata leaves, fruits and seeds have demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo anti-BC activities.151-154 These anti- BC activities have been linked to the regulation of immune system, the reduction of inflammation, the suppression of various signalling pathways (eg, epidermal [NF-B]), the mod - ulation of cell cycle regulators, as well as the stimulation of ROS generation and consequent induction of caspase-depen - dent apoptosis.151,153,154 Sabapati et al155 loaded A. muricata fruit extract into SLNs and found that extract-loaded SLNs caused a greater dose-dependent reduction in MCF-7 cell viability than the free extract (IC 50 values of 12 \u00b5g/mL vs 30 \u00b5g/mL). Flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V-FITC- stained cells further showed that extract-loaded SLNs could induce a significantly higher percentage of apoptotic MCF-7 cell death than the free extract (86.0% vs 71.34%). Interestingly, void SLNs did not elicit significant cytotoxi - city against MCF-7 cells. Collectively, these findings indi - cate that SLNs are biocompatible NDDSs capable of enhancing the cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic activity of A. muricata extract against BC cells. In another study, Jabir et al156 reported the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using silver nitrate solu - tion and A. muricata aqueous peel extract. The resulting silver nanoparticles (AMSNPs) elicited a significant, time- dependent anti-proliferative effect on AMJ-13 BC cell line (IC 50 = 17.34 \u00b5g/mL) but had a less significant effect on normal HBL breast epithelial cell line. This anti-prolifera - tive activity of AMSNPs was linked to the induction of apoptosis via p53 signalling, as evidenced by the observa - tions of disrupted membrane integrity and lysosomal vacuoles, increased percentage of sub-G1 phase corre - sponding to apoptotic cells, m loss and upregulated p53 expression in treated AMJ-13 cells. However, the study did not compare the anti-BC effect of AMSNPs with that of free A. muricata aqueous peel as \"transparent wood rose\", can be found in many countries such as Africa, America, Bangladesh, China, India, Madagascar, Mauritania, Pakistan, Philippines and Sri Lanka.157,158 It is one of the medicinal plants that have been employed in the Ayurvedic medicine for treating bron - chitis, cancer, cervical lymphadenitis, gout, constipa - //doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S328135 press (www.tcpdf.org) Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)induced lacrimation, inflammation, jaundice, neurological disorders, obesity, skin disorders and ulcers.157,158 Additionally, I. turpethum extracts (ie, from stems, roots, aerial and whole part) have also demonstrated anti-cancer potentials in preclinical BC models.159,160 One study further showed that the anti-BC activities of I. turpethum stem extract are mediated, at least partly, via its antioxidant activity.159 Similarly, Mughees et al161 found that I. turpethum etha- nolic extracts prepared from different plant parts (ie, flowers, leaves, roots, aerial and whole part) demonstrated significant cytotoxicities against both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 BC cell lines. The root extract that exhibited the greatest cytotoxicity (IC50 values of 452.35 \u00b5g/mL for MCF-7 cells and 310 \u00b5g/mL for MDA-MB-231 cells) was subsequently loaded into poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (NIPAAM; for temperature sensitiv - ity), N-vinyl pyrrolidone (VP; for temperature sensitivity) and acrylic acid (AA; for pH sensitivity) co-polymeric nanoparti - cles. The TME is generally more acidic and has a higher temperature than normal tissues owing to the excessive lactic acid produced from enhanced glycolysis and the secretion nanoparticle system takes advantage of these TME characteristics for targeted delivery of loaded root extract to the tumour sites.161 Expectedly, it was observed that this nanoformulation exerted greater cytotoxicity than the free root extract (ie, IC 50 values of 221.81 \u00b5g/mL for MCF-7 cells and 171.13 \u00b5g/mL for MDA- MB-231 cells). Moreover, IC 50 concentrations of this nano - formulation also markedly reduced MCF-7 (from 99.2% to 57.7%) and MDA-MB-231 (from 99.3% to 55.4%) cell pro - liferation; as well as significantly increased the percentage of early and late apoptotic MCF-7 (from 2.2% to 3.4% and from and (from 6.3% to 14.7% and from 4.5% to 7.3% respectively) cells, the con - densation of nuclear chromatin and the accumulation of MCF- 7 (from 50.7% to 63.4%) and MDA-MB-231 (from 57.9% to 81.3%) cell populations in G0/G1 phase. These observations collectively indicate that the NIPAAM-VP-AA co-polymeric nanoparticle-based nanoformulation can enhance the cytotoxi - city of I. turpethum extract as well as exert anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic and cell cycle arrest-inducing activities against BC cells. The Mirabilis jalapa Extracts Mirabilis jalapa (four o'clock flower), a medicinal plant that can be found in Brazil, India and Mexico, has been used traditionally in the treatment of abscess, boils, bruises, diarrhoea, inflammation, pain, piles, ulcers, urticaria and wounds.163 It has been reported to contain ribosome-inactivat - ing proteins (RIPs).163 RIPs are a family of proteins with N-glycosidase activity that catalyses the removal of a single adenine from ribosomal ribonucleic acid, thereby leading to protein synthesis inhibition.164 They play a key role in defend - ing plants against attacks from pathogens and insects.165 Interestingly, RIPs isolated from M. jalapa leaves have demonstrated cytotoxicity against T47D BC cell line.166 However, more needs to be done to fully elucidate the anti- BC mechanism(s) of RIPs. As proteins are subjected to rapid enzymatic degradation following oral administration and have poor membrane per - meability, Wicaksono et al167 formulated a RIP extract of M. leaves (RIP-MJ) into anti-EpCAM antibody-conju - molecule (EpCAM) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is lowly expressed in normal breast tissues but becomes overexpressed in breast carcinomas.168 As such, conjugation of nanoparticles with anti-EpCAM antibody enables active breast \u00b5g/mL 14.87 \u00b5g/mL vs 1842.03 \u00b5g/mL).167 Interestingly, while free RIP-MJ had a lower IC 50 value in normal Vero kidney cells than in T47D cells (1387.87 \u00b5g/mL vs 1842.03 \u00b5g/mL), the opposite was for anti-EpCAM antibody-conjugated (IC 50 values of 33.62 \u00b5g/mL vs 13.27 \u00b5g/mL) and unconjugated \u00b5g/mL) RIP-MJ nanoparti - cles. These findings collectively suggest that the use of NDDS and targeting ligand can improve both the cytotoxi - city and the selectivity of RIP-MJ against BC cells. The Plectranthus amboinicus Extracts Plectranthus amboinicus , commonly known as Indian borage, is an Asian native plant that can also be found in the Americas.169 It has been used in Brazil to treat various medical conditions such as inflammation and cancer.170 In particular, its leaves have been reported to contain com - pounds with anti-cancer activities (eg, cinaminics, essen - tial oils, flavonoids and terpene preclinical studies focussing on P. amboi - nicus leaf extract revealed its anti-BC activities.169-174 In one of these studies, the pro-apoptotic activity of P. amboi - nicus leaf extract was linked to the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7.171 https: //doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S328135 Dove Press International Journal of Nanomedicine 2021:16 7910Yap et al Dove press Powered by TCPDF TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)Hasibuan and chitosan-sodium nanoparticles (PAEEN) and reported that 24 h of PAEEN treatment could cause a dose-dependent reduction in T47D cell viability (IC 50 = 89.166 \u00b5g/mL). Interestingly, although T47D cell proliferation increased following 24 h of PAEEN treatment, a dose-dependent reduction in T47D cell prolif - eration was seen following 48 h and 72 h of PAEEN treat - ment. Subsequent flow cytometric analysis revealed that PAEEN could also induce apoptosis in T47D cells. However, the study did not compare these observed cyto - toxic, anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities of PAEEN with those of free P. amboinicus ethanolic leaf extract. The Punica granatum Extracts Punica granatum (pomegranate), a deciduous shrub native to Asian countries such as Iran and India, is also widely cultivated in Mediterranean countries, such as Egypt, Morocco, Spain, Tunisia and Turkey.176,177 The therapeu - tic potentials of various P. granatum parts (ie, bark, flow - ers, fruits, leaves, roots and seeds) have been recognised early and exploited in different traditional medicine sys - tems (eg, Ayurveda, Chinese, Islamic and Persian) for treating diarrhoea, dysentery, heart choking, intense cough, jaundice, nasal bleeding, periodontitis, sore throat, spleen diseases, ulcers, etc.178 These medicinal benefits of P. granatum are attributed to its pharmacological activities such wound healing,181 cardioprotective,182 anti-inflammatory and anti- nociceptive183 activities. There has also been extensive preclinical evaluation of the potential utilisation of P . granatum fruit and peel extracts in BC treatment.184-188 Evidences from these studies suggested that the anti-BC activities of P . granatum extracts are mediated via the suppression of NF-B and -catenin signalling pathways; the downregulation of Rho cellular profile, and lial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers; the downre - gulation of DNA repair genes and consequent induction of DNA double-strand breaks; and its anti-estrogenic activity. induced a more significant reduction in MCF-7 and Hs578T BC cell growth than the free extract (IC 50 values of 19.36 \u00b1 3.70 \u00b5g/mL cells). Interestingly, void PLGA-PEG nanoparticles had no significant effect on MCF-7 and Hs578T cell growth. These observations col - lectively indicate that the PLGA-PEG nanoparticle system is biocompatible and capable of enhancing the growth- inhibitory activity of P. granatum extract against BC cells. Besides, Badawi et al190 loaded P. granatum fruit extract into SLNs and found that this nanoformulation significantly reduced MCF-7 cell viability to a greater extent than the free extract, with a 47-fold reduction in IC50 value (1.05 \u00b5g/mL vs 49.2 \u00b5g/mL). Similarly, void SLNs were observed to exhibit cytotoxicity against MCF- 7 cells. The observed enhancement in cytotoxicity may thus, at least partly, be explained by the synergistic effect between P. granatum extract and SLNs. Importantly, P . granatum extract-loaded SLNs had a higher IC 50 value normal HFB-4 melanocytes than in MCF-7 cells (19.34 \u00b5g/mL vs 1.05 suggesting that this nanoformula - tion is BC cell-selective. Collectively, these observations suggest that SLNs can enhance the cytotoxicity of P. granatum extract against BC cells, possibly via synergism and improvement of BC cell selectivity. Putranjiva roxburghii (or Drypetes roxburghii ), an ever - green tree native to India, is locally referred to as \"Amulet-Plant or Wild Olive or Child-Life-Tree\".191 It is also widely distributed in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, the United States, Trinidad and Tobago.191,192 Traditionally, it has been used in Ayurveda for treating conditions such as azoospermia, burning sensation, hot swellings, eye dis - orders, smallpox as well as mouth and stomach ulcers.192 More recent studies have revealed roxburghii leaf and seed extracts.193-195 However, further mechanistic studies are required to explain how P. roxburghii extracts exert these pharmacological activities. Balkrishna et al196 carried out the green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using silver nitrate solution and P . rox - burghii aqueous seed extract. The study revealed that P. roxburghii silver nanoparticles (PJSNPs) could exert more potent cytotoxic effect on MDA-MB-231 cells than the free extract (IC 50 values of 0.26 mg/mL vs 7.7 mg/mL). This promising finding may be attributed to the small size (~8 \u00b1 2 nm) and negative zeta potential (26.71 mV) of PJSNPs, which can enhance both their bioavailability and cellular International Journal of Nanomedicine 2021:16 https: //doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S328135 Dove Press 7911Dove press by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)uptake. Furthermore, IC 50 concentration of PJSNPs also increased the percentage of apoptotic cells (69%) and induced DNA fragmentation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Notably, PJSNP treatment did not show marked cytotoxi - city against peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Taken together, this nanoformulation can enhance the cyto - toxicity of P . roxburghii extract and exert pro-apoptotic activity against BC cells while sparing toxicities against PBMCs. Another study by Nayaka et al197 similarly reported the cytotoxicity of PJSNPs against cells (IC 50 Avishan-e-Shirazi, is a thyme-like plant that can be found extensively in Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan.198 It is not only a popular condimental plant but also a traditional medicinal plant that has been employed as anaesthetic, studies have evaluated the pharmacological activities of Z. multiflora essential oil (ZEO), the constituents of which are dominated ZEO has also been reported to mediate potent anti-BC activities via the sti - mulation of ROS generation, the intercalation of DNA strands, the induction of DNA damage and the eventual induction of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.198,204 Salehi et al205 attempted to overcome the limitations hindering the clinical development of essential oils via the development of a citrus pectin-based nanoemulsion for ZEO (CP-ZEO NE). Both dose-dependently decreased MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and T47D cell proliferation but had no significant effect on the proliferation of normal L929 fibroblast cells. However, a reduced sensitivity to ZEO was observed in MDA-MB- 231 and T47D cells 24 h following treatment, possibly due to the high volatility and low stability of ZEO. Interestingly, CP-ZEO NE preparation may have improved ZEO stability, as CP-ZEO NE-treated MCF-7, MDA-MB- 231 and T47D cells demonstrated the highest sensitivity to CP-ZEO NE at 72 h. This finding is consistent with the lower IC 50 values of CP-ZEO NE over ZEO at 72 h in MCF-7 (5.38 vs greater anti-proliferative activity against MDA-MB-231 spheroids than ZEO, as reflected by a lower IC 50 value after 48 h of treatment (65.5 \u00b5g/mL vs 118.4 \u00b5g/mL). Moreover, CP-ZEO NE apoptotic activity against MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and T47D cells, as evidenced apoptosis-related morpholo - gical changes (eg, small, rounded, wrinkled and cell shape, low-density and membrane blebbing); increased orange-red fluorescence, nuclear fragmentation dium V-FITC/PI staining; and percentage sub-G1 phase to apoptotic cells. Pro-apoptotic activity CP- NE similarly observed in MDA-MB-231 spher - oids. Additionally, CP-ZEO NE treatment also induced a G2/M phase arrest in MDA-MB-231 cells but a S phase arrest in MDA-MB-231 spheroids. Taken together, CP- ZEO NE is a biocompatible nanoformulation that is cap - able of enhancing the stability and anti-proliferative activ - ity of ZEO as well as exerting pro-apoptotic and cell cycle arrest-inducing activities against BC cells and spheroids. The Anti-Breast Cancer Mechanisms of Natural Bioactive Compounds and Anti-Breast Cancer Activities of Their Nanoformulations in Preclinical Models A number of bioactive compounds isolated from natural sources have been proven to be effective in the treatment of human diseases, including cancer.206 Table 5 sum- marises the proposed anti-BC mechanisms of selected natural bioactive compounds. However, the clinical utili - sation of natural bioactive compounds is often challenged by their low stability, poor aqueous solubility and low bioavailability.207 One approach to overcoming these chal - lenges includes the exploitation of ).

It was found that void niosomes at doses below 625 \u00b5g/mL were not cytotoxic to A2780 ovarian cancer cells and ZR-75-1 BC cells. Therefore, 625 \u00b5g/mL noisome was used to deliver balanocarpol for ensuring any observed cytotoxi - city was induced solely by balanocarpol. Balanocarpol- encapsulated niosomes exhibited significantly greater cytotoxicity against ZR-75-1 than free balanocarpol (IC 50 values of 57.97 spp., an entomopathogenic fungus, is usually found in Asia, Europe and North America.213 Cordycepin (3-deoxyadenosine), an adenosine analogue, is the main bioactive of Cordyceps spp.214 It has been exten - sively investigated a nucleoside antagonist, cordy - cepin is known to exert anti-cancer effects principally by inhibiting RNA synthesis.217 Further investigations into its anti-BC mechanisms have suggested that the induction of autophagy-associated cell death, mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and caspase-dependent apoptosis; the regulation of p53 and estrogen signalling pathways; the promotion of DNA double-strand breaks and DNA damage response; the inhibition of poly(ADP)ribosylation; the suppression of hedgehog and Notch signalling pathways; the modulation of EMT markers; and the stimulation of ROS generation are also involved.215-219 However, the clinical application of cordycepin has been hindered due to toxicity to normal cells as well as poor bioavailability resulting from low aqu - eous solubility and rapid metabolism by adenosine deaminase.226 A the encapsulation of cordycepin into PLGA nanoparticles (CPNPs) and observed that CPNPs had a higher uptake by MCF-7 cells than free cordycepin.227 This translated to a significantly greater cytotoxic effect of CPNPs on MCF-7 cells (IC 50 values of 16.79 \u00b5g/mL vs 47.84 \u00b5g/mL). In addition, CPNPs also enabled the sustained release of cordycepin (65% release in ten days), thus prolonging its anti-BC action. Importantly, while free cordycepin elicited hemolytic activity against rat red blood cells at 50 to 100 \u00b5g/ mL, CPNPs of equivalent doses did not cause hemolysis. As opposed to free cordycepin, these findings suggest that CPNPs can exert marked and prolonged anti-BC activity at a non- hemotoxic concentration. Curcumin Curcumin [1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-hep - tadiene-3,5-dione] is in the rhizome of Curcuma longa (turmeric).228 It has shown benefits in diseases such as inflammatory conditions, kid - ney conditions, metabolic syndrome and pain, most of which have been attributed to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities.228 Importantly, it has also demon - strated anti-cancer potentials both preclinically as and neck237 cancers. Specifically, the anti-BC activities of curcumin have been linked to the modulation of cell cycle regulators and metastasis-related pathways; the activation of p53 signalling path - way; as well as the inhibition of angiogenesis.230-233 However, the clinical applicability of curcumin is chal - lenged by its poor bioavailability resulting from low aqu - eous solubility, poor absorption, extensive metabolism, rapid degradation at physiological pH and rapid systemic employed to overcome the poor bioavailability of curcumin. For example, Farhangi et al240 prepared dendrosomal curcu - min (DNC) and tested its effects on both in vitro and in vivo metastatic BC models. While free curcumin caused https: //doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S328135 Dove Press International Journal of Nanomedicine 2021:16 7924Yap et al Dove press Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)an obvious reduction in 4T1 cell viability only at 72 h, DNC dose- and time-dependently suppressed 4T1 cell viability from 24 to 72 h (IC 50 values of 32.5 \u00b5M at 24 h, 25 \u00b5M at 48 h and 17.5 \u00b5M at 72 h). Furthermore, DNC also dose-dependently elicited greater anti-migratory and anti-adhesive effects on 4T1 cells than free curcumin. Interestingly, DNC only demonstrated slight cytotoxic effects on normal mouse embryonic fibroblastic cells at high doses, indicating its biocompatible nature. When mice bearing 4T1 xenografts were subjected to intraper - itoneal injection of DNC for seven days, it was found that doses up to 80 mg/kg were remarkably safe whereas 160 and 320 mg/kg DNC caused mild symptoms of hemato - toxicity, hepatotoxicity and renal toxicity. These suggest that 80 mg/kg DNC may be more physiologically rele - vant in treating BC. In comparison to untreated controls, DNC-treated mice (40-80 mg/kg; 35 days) showed higher survival rates, lower tumour incidence, smaller tumour volume and tumour weight as well as lower incidence of metastasis. In addition, these mice also had lower mRNA levels of NF-B p105 [COX-2]) in BC xenografts, brain, liver, lungs and spleen. Taken together, DNC is both biocompatible and capable of enhancing the anti-BC efficacy of curcumin, and its observed in vitro and in vivo anti-BC activities are likely correlated with the suppression of NF-B signalling. Hasan et al241 loaded curcumin into nanoliposomes derived from salmon, soya curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes rapeseed curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes induced an obvious reduction in MCF-7 cell index only from 12 to 20 \u00b5M, salmon curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes could significantly reduce MCF-7 cell index from 5 to 20 \u00b5M. Interestingly, void salmon nanoliposomes were reported to exert greater anti-proliferative effect on MCF-7 cells than void soya and rapeseed nanoliposomes. Lipid profiling revealed that salmon lecithins uniquely contained a high proportion of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahex - anoic acid (DHA),241 both of which have previously been reported to possess anti-cancer potentials.242 Collectively, these findings suggest that the observed higher anti-BC efficacy of salmon curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes may be partly attributed to the synergistic effect between EPA- and DHA-containing salmon nanoliposomes and curcu - min. In another study, the same research group coated lecithin nanoliposomes with chitosan and found that chitosan-coated curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes anti-proliferative activity against MCF-7 cells than their uncoated counterparts.243 This improvement in anti- BC efficacy offered by chitosan coating is potentially linked to enhanced permeation and encapsulation effi - ciency of nanoliposomes. Besides, gum arabic-based nanoformulations have also been developed. For instance, a study reported the pre - paration of curcumin loaded-gum arabic aldehyde-gelatin (Cur/GA Ald-Gel) nanogels.244 In study, free curcumin was found to significantly reduce MCF-7 cell viability from 3.125 to 50 \u00b5g/mL. In contrast, Cur/GA Ald-Gel nanogels could only induce significant cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 cells from 12.5 to 50 \u00b5g/mL, and these effects were less significant than those induced by equivalent doses of free curcumin. This lower in vitro anti-BC effi - cacy of Cur/GA Ald-Gel nanogels may be explained by the slow release of curcumin (ie, <65% during the treat - ment period of 24 h). Nonetheless, the nano-range size (452 \u00b1 8 nm) of Cur/GA Ald-Gel nanogels promote their in vivo tumour accumulation via the EPR effect, and their large negative zeta potential (27 \u00b1 4 mV) may confer good in vivo stability. Additionally, the release rate of curcumin was observed to be higher under an acidic condition (pH 5) than a neutral condition (pH 7.4), which is suggestive of preferential curcumin release at the tumour sites. Although Cur/GA Ald-Gel nanogels dose-dependent hemolysis, the observed percentages of was <5%;244 thus classifying them as \"hemo - compatible\" according to the ISO/TR 7406 standard.245 Overall, these findings suggest that although Cur/GA Ald-Gel nanogels did not demonstrate superior in vitro anti-BC efficacy as compared to free curcumin, they are hemocompatible and their nano-range size, large negative zeta potential and pH-dependent release property may lead to superior in vivo anti-BC efficacy. Another study reported the encapsulation arabic- sodium alginate (Cur/GA-Alg) nanoparticles.239 GA-Alg nanoparticles against MCF-7 cells were consis - tently lower than those of free curcumin at 24 h (48.40 \u00b5g/ mL GA-Alg nanoparticles showed significant cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells, indicating that this NDDS is capable of enhancing the anti-BC efficacy of curcumin while being biocompatible. International Journal 2021:16 https: //doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S328135 Dove press developed.246 Curcumin-loaded membranes were found to morphological changes (eg, cell shrinkage and increased apoptotic bodies) and dose-dependent reduction in viability in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, while free curcumin demon - strated greater cytotoxicity in normal HFB-4 were not cytotoxic that A/CNC hydrogel membranes are biocompatible study reported a novel water-soluble nanomicelle that is formed via the self-assembly of pectin- curcumin conjugates, with hydrophobic curcumin sitting in the core and hydrophilic pectin polymer backbone forming the outer shell.247 It was observed that pectin-curcumin con - jugates elicited greater cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells than free curcumin (IC 50 values 12.0 \u00b1 3.0 \u00b5M vs 48.3 \u00b1 2.9 \u00b5M). This in cytotoxicity is likely attributed to improved aqueous solubility and stability. Notably, pectin- curcumin conjugates also demonstrated lower cytotoxicity against normal 293A human kidney cells than free curcumin (IC50 values of 139.4 \u00b1 2.1 \u00b5M 1.5 \u00b5M). Taken together, conjugation to pectin can enhance the anti-BC efficacy of curcumin (via solubility and stability improve - ment) while minimising its toxicity to normal cells. Different protein-based nanoformulations of curcumin have also been developed. For al248 devel - anti-proliferative effect on MDA-MB-231 cells than free curcumin. This enhancement in anti-BC efficacy may be a result of enhanced dissolution rate and aqueous solubility. Furthermore, it was observed in rats following a single intravenous injection of 10 mg CAENs that CAENs tended to accumulate in brain and lungs, which are the common sites of BC metastases. These observations collectively reflect the potentials of CAENs in enhancing the anti-BC efficacy of curcumin and in treating metastatic al206 nanoparticles exhibited cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells after 48 h (IC 50 = 64.8 \u00b5g/mL). This IC50 value is close to but higher than that of 48 h free curcumin treatment (IC 50 = 53.18 \u00b5g/mL) observed in another study,249 which may be explained by the slow release of curcumin from nanoparticles (ie, only 40-60% after 48 h).206 Moreover, void Gel nanoparticles yielded a high IC 50 value of 2.9 mg/mL against MCF-7 cells. These findings collectively suggest that Gel nanoparticles are biocompatible and capable of prolonging curcumin action, although they do not significantly improve the anti-BC efficacy of curcumin. Curcumin has also been encapsulated into BC cells than free curcumin, possibly attributable to improved stability and preferential curcu - min release under acidic conditions.250 Cur/PEGylated Fe3O4@AuNPs also demonstrated pro-apoptotic activity against SKBR3 cells. Subsequent gene expression analysis linked this pro-apoptotic activity to Bax upregulation and Bcl-2 downregulation. Additionally, observed. Taken together, Cur/PEGylated Fe3O4@AuNPs mediate enhanced cytotoxic effect on BC cells by upregulating Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and inducing apop - tosis; and they may potentially inhibit BC cell migration by downregulating MMP-9. Folic acid (FA) has a strong binding affinity for folate receptors, which are glycosylphosphatidylinositol- anchored membrane proteins often overexpressed in BC.251 Therefore, J. et al252 MSNs conjugated with FA (Cur- Ca@DMSNs-FA) for achieving active BC cell targeting and facilitating cellular uptake of nanoparticles. In the study, Cur-Ca@DMSNs-FA demonstrated improved aqu - eous solubility and in vivo bioavailability as compared to free curcumin, and showed a remarkably higher curcumin release rate under acidic (80% in 0.5 h) than neutral (35% in 12 h) conditions. Unsurprisingly, it was further observed that Cur-Ca@DMSNs-FA (5-20 and arrest-inducing activity (41.07% vs 24.54% of cells in G2/M phase) against MCF-7 cells than comparable doses of free curcumin. Interestingly, void Ca@DMSNs-FA (320 \u00b5g/mL) was non-toxic to MCF-7 cells and had a hemolytic ratio of 4.38% (<5%). Taken together, this NDDS is biocompatible and capable of enhancing the anti-BC efficacy of curcumin via enhanced cellular uptake, improved aqueous solubility and bioavailability as well as pH-dependent curcumin release. The same study reported higher ROS production in MCF-7 cells treated with Cur-Ca@DMSNs-FA than those treated with free curcumin. Further protein expres - sion analysis revealed that Cur-Ca@DMSNs-FA also https: //doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S328135 Dove Press International Journal of Nanomedicine 2021:16 7926Yap et al Dove press Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)induced p53 inhibitor than free curcumin. Collectively, these findings linked the anti-BC activities of Cur- Ca@DMSNs-FA to the induction of oxidative stress and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, as well the sativum (garlic), native to Central Asia and north - eastern Iran, is now widely cultivated throughout the world.253,254 It has commonly been used as both a spice and a medicinal plant in treating bone diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, gastric diseases, hyper - tension, metabolic disorders, microbial infections, skin diseases, etc.253,254 These health benefits of A. sativum are attributed to its diverse range of bioactive compounds. - 255 Its major organosulfur compound, diallyl disulfide, has been reported to mediate anti-BC activities by caspase-dependent apoptosis and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, histone deacetylation, modulating EMT suppressing -cate - nin and SRC/rat sarcoma virus (Ras)/ERK signalling disulfide has in comparison to conventional chemotherapeutic agents (eg, 5-fluoroura - cil and cyclophosphamide), thus suggesting its potential to be developed as an anti-BC agent.261 Although the clinical translation of diallyl disulfide has been restricted by its low water solubility, poor bioavail - ability and short half-life, these problems have been tackled by NDDSs. Talluri et al262 reported SLNs (DADS-SLNs). DADS- SLNs were found to uptake by MCF-7 cells than free diallyl disulfide. DADS-SLNs could also prefer - entially release diallyl disulfide under acidic conditions (pH 4.5) and enable sustained diallyl disulfide release up to 48 h. As expected, DADS-SLNs (1.562-100 \u00b5M) were capable of eliciting greater cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 cells than free diallyl disulfide. This enhancement in anti-BC efficacy was further reflected by changes in cellular oxidative status and apoptotic marker expression. For instance, DADS-SLN-treated MCF-7 cells had higher ROS production; higher levels of (eg, cell disulfide-treated MCF-7 cells. were not cyto - toxic to normal MCF-10A human breast epithelial cells. Taken together, this nanoformulation is biocompatible and capable of enhancing the anti-BC efficacy of diallyl dis - ulfide by exhibiting enhanced cellular uptake as well as enabling both pH-dependent and sustained release of dia - llyl disulfide. Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a multi-ligand single transmembrane receptor belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily, is frequently overex - pressed in late-stage BC.263 Therefore, the same research group further conjugated DADS-SLNs with anti-RAGE antibody (RAGE-DADS-SLNs) to enable active BC cell targeting.10 As expected, RAGE-DADS-SLNs (1.562-100 \u00b5M) exhibited significantly higher cellular uptake and cyto - toxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells than DADS-SLNs. RAGE- DADS-SLNs also showed higher pro-apoptotic activity, as reflected by their ability to induce a greater increase in the level of pro-apoptotic protein (eg, caspase-9) and a greater decrease in the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins (eg, Bcl-2 and survivin) than DADS-SLNs. Furthermore, it has been reported that RAGE activation can lead to the stimulation of signalling pathways (eg, ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 [Rac1], MAPK and NF-B) implicated in cell migration and invasion, thereby contributing to tumour progression.264 This indicates that the observed greater cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic activity of RAGE-DADS- SLNs than DADS-SLNs may be the consequence of both cellular uptake enhancement and RAGE inhibition.10 Epigallocatechin Gallate Green tea, one of the most widely consumed beverages worldwide, is obtained from the leaves of Camellia sinen - sis tea plant.265 Green tea consumption has long been associated with health-promoting properties in athero - sclerosis, bacterial and viral infections, cancers of the breast, colon, oesophagus, kidney, lung, mouth, pancreas, small intestine and stomach, diabetes, heart diseases, liver diseases, obesity, etc.265 Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the major green tea catechin, is believed to contribute to the majority of green tea-associated health benefits.266 Specifically, EGCG has been reported to mediate anti-BC effects preclinically via the modulation of metastasis- https: //doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S328135 press TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Powered TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)related markers; the suppression of PI3K/AKT and -cate - signalling pathways; the suppression of - cible factor-1 alpha apoptotic miR-25-dependent apoptosis and autophagy; as well as the inhibition of - bolism and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) transcription.267-272 Despite these promising pre - clinical findings, the clinical application of EGCG is hin - dered due to its poor bioavailability and low nanoformulation enabled sustained EGCG release (ie, >90% release in 24 h) and improved EGCG stability. Expectedly, EGCG-SLNs could induce a more significant dose-dependent reduction in MDA-MB-231 cell viability than free EGCG (IC 50 values of 9.7 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b5g/mL vs 78.9 \u00b1 4.3 \u00b5g/mL). Moreover, EGCG-SLNs also elicited greater pro-apoptotic activity against MDA-MB-231 cells than free EGCG, as evidenced by the observations of more extensive morphological changes (eg, cell shrinkage and elongated-to-spherical cell shape), nuclear shrinkage and apoptotic body forma - in observa ble cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that this NDDS is biocompatible and capable of enhancing the anti-BC efficacy of EGCG via its sustained release and stability improvement. Bombesin (BBN; a 14-amino acid peptide) is a natural ligand for gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, which is a G-protein coupled receptor that is overexpressed in var - ious cancers, including BC.274 The same research group thus further conjugated EGCG-SLNs with BBN to achieve active BC cell targeting.275 In the study, increased cellular uptake of BBN-conjugated EGCG-SLNs relative to uncon - jugated EGCG-SLNs was observed. Consequently, BBN- conjugated EGCG-SLNs could exert greater cytotoxicity (IC 50 values of 3.2 \u00b1 1.7 \u00b5g/mL vs 6.9 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b5g/mL) and pro-apoptotic against both EGCG-SLNs and BBN-conjugated EGCG-SLNs exhibited greater anti- migratory effect on MDA-MB-231 cells than pure EGCG, the effect of the latter was more intensive. Collectively, the results indicate that enhanced cellular uptake mediated by BBN conjugation can improve the anti-BC efficacy of EGCG-SLNs.Gallic Acid Gallic acid (3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid), one of the most common plant phenolic acids, can be found in a variety of medicinal plants and fruits such as Quercus spp. and Punica spp.276 It has been associated with tremendous health bene - fits owing to the wide range of its pharmacological activities, including anti-BC,277-281 anti-inflammatory,282 activities. Specifically, the anti-BC activities of gallic acid have been linked to various mechanisms such as the modulation of p53, Mcl-1 and p21 expression and consequent induction mito - chondrial apoptotic pathway; the activation of p38 signalling pathway as well as consequent modulation of cell cycle regulators and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis; the modulation of metastasis-related markers; as well as the suppression of NF-B signalling pathway and consequent downregulation of NF-B target genes signifying anti- inflammatory receptor type 4 [CXCR4]) effects.277-281 However, the therapeutic potential of gallic acid as an anti-BC agent is restricted by its low bioavailabil - ity resulting from poor absorption and rapid metabolism.288 Hassani et al288 reported the preparation of gum arabic- stabilised gallic acid nanoparticles (GANPs). It was observed that GANPs could exert more significant cytotoxi - city against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells than free gallic acid, as well as retard the migratory capacity of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Interestingly, GANPs demonstrated differential cellular uptake in different BC cell lines, whereby a significantly higher uptake was seen in MCF-7 than MDA-MB-231 cells. This may potentially explain the greater cytotoxic and anti-migratory effects of GANPs on MCF-7 than MDA-MB-231 cells. Importantly, GANPs showed negligible cytotoxicity against normal MCF-10A human breast epithelial cells and preferentially released gallic acid under acidic condition (pH 4.8; 95.96%) rather than neutral condition (pH 7.4; 74.56%), reflecting the biocompatibility and BC cell selectivity of this nanoformulation. In the same study, various in vitro antioxidant assays (ie, 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical [DPPH], nitric assays) consistently suggested that GANPs exhibited greater antioxidant activity than free gallic acid.288 This activity enhancement may partly https: //doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S328135 Dove Press International Journal of Nanomedicine 2021:16 7928Yap et al Dove press Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)be attributed to the synergistic effect between gallic acid and gum arabic, both of which have previously been reported as potent antioxidants.284,289 Cancer cells are often in a pro- oxidative state.290 ROS is implicated in cancer initiation and progression as it can induce gene mutations and changes in various signalling pathways involved in cell differentiation, survival, growth, proliferation, protein synthesis and glucose metabolism.291,292 Using antioxidants to deplete cancer cells from these ROS-induced cellular events may thus have pre - ventive and therapeutic effects. Taken together, GANPs are biocompatible and can improve the anti-BC efficacy of gallic acid by enhancing its BC cell selectivity and antioxidant activity. Punicalagin and Ellagic major P. granatum polyphenol, is an ellagitannin that has been reported to mediate anti-BC effects via the downregulation of golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) and consequent modulation of metastasis- related and EMT markers, as well as its antioxidant activity and consequent inhibition of oxidative DNA damage.293,294 However, ellagitannins are not absorbable in the gastrointestinal tract.295 They usually undergo phy - siological pH- and/or gut microbiota-facilitated hydrolysis in the stomach or small intestine to yield ellagic acid (2,3,7,8-tetrahydroxychromeno[5,4,3-cde]chromene-5,10- dione).295 Ellagic acid can be subjected to bolism by colonic microbiota to yield ellagic acid has demonstrated anti-BC activities preclinically, with the associated molecular mechanisms being the inhibition of angiogenesis via vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signalling pathway suppression;297 the regulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF- )/Smads signalling pathway;298 the suppression of - catenin signalling pathway via actinin alpha 4 (ACTN4) downregulation and downregulation of stem- like markers, cyclins mesenchymal markers;299 as well as the inhibition of CDK6 expression and activity.300 However, the poor absorption and bioavailability of puni - calagin and ellagic acid, together with the short elimina - tion half-life of ellagic acid, can efficacies.301,302 A polymer-based nanoformulation of punicalagin acid has been reported by Shirode et al.189 In the study, it was found that punicalagin- and ellagic acid- encapsulated PLGA-PEG nanoparticles MCF-7 and Hs578T cells than free punicalagin and ellagic acid. Interestingly, punicalagin-encapsulated PLGA-PEG nano than ellagic acid-encapsulated PLGA-PEG nanoparticles in both MCF-7 (IC 50 values of 7.5 \u00b5M vs 50.5 \u00b5M) and Hs578T (IC 50 values of \u00b5M vs lines. Sulforaphane Sulforaphane [1-isothiocyanato-4-(methylsulfinyl)butane] is an isothiocyanate organosulfur compound that naturally in the form of inactive glucoraphanin in cruciferous vegetables, myrosinase-catalysed hydrolysis and/or gut microbiota-mediated degradation.303 Sulforaphane has been extensively investigated for a range prop - erties, has pre - clinically recognised as a promising anti-BC candidate.310313 Its anti-BC effects have been proposed to be mediated via the targeting of heat shock response and consequent modulation of tumour suppressors and induction of caspase-dependent of PI3K/AKT/mTOR/ribosomal protein S6 1 signalling pathway and consequent induction of autophagy and inhibition of tumour suppressor genes;312 as well as the mod - ulation of markers associated with aggressive phenotype (eg, downregulation of markers, metastasis-related growth factors).313 However, the industralisation of sulforaphane has been hindered due to its low aqueous solubility as well as instability resulting from high sensitivity to light, pH, tempera - ture and oxygen.314 In a study, it was PEGylated Fe 3O4@AuNPs (SF/PEGylated cytotoxicity against SKBR3 cells than free sulforaphane, possibly due to enhanced stabi - lity of sulforaphane and its preferential release under acidic conditions provided by this nanoformulation.250 The cyto - toxicity of SF/PEGylated Fe 3O4@AuNPs against SKBR3 cells was mediated by apoptosis induction, whereby down - regulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax were observed. The further observation of MMP-9 downregulation reflected the anti-migratory potential of SF/PEGylated 2021:16 https: //doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S328135 Dove press TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org) Powered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)Fe3O4@AuNPs in SKBR3 cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that the encapsulation of sulforaphane into PEGylated Fe 3O4@AuNPs can enhance its anti-BC efficacy, and this nanoformulation exhibits pro-apoptotic and anti- migratory activities against BC cells. Future Perspectives Plant-based natural products have long been recognised as a vital source of anti-cancer drugs. This review introduces nine selected medicinal plants, including A. capillus-veneris, P . quadriaurita, A. multiflora , the extracts/essential oils of which have been evaluated for anti-BC potentials. Another nine natural bioactive com - pounds that have previously demonstrated and sulforaphane, have also been highlighted. Mechanistic stu - dies have linked the anti-BC activities of these natural pro - ducts to a wide range of molecular targets or mechanisms, including the modulation of angiogenesis, apoptotic path - ways, autophagy, cell cycle regulators, cellular eicosanoid profile, DNA structure, synthesis, repair genes and damage response, EMT markers, enzymes, epigenetic mechanisms, glucose metabolism, heat shock response, immune system, inflammation, markers associated with aggressive pheno - type, metastasis-related markers, miRNA, oxidative status, proliferation markers, protein synthesis, RNA synthesis, sig - nalling pathways, stem-like markers and tumour suppressors. However, there is a lack of investigation into the anti-BC mechanisms of I. turpethum, M. jalapa, P . amboinicus and P . roxburghii extracts, which represents a future research direc - tion to be addressed. Although the abovementioned natural products have shown promising anti-BC activities in preclinical studies, they have not been advanced further into clinical settings. This may be attributed to their undesirable physicochem - ical properties, which may result in poor stability, aqueous solubility and bioavailability that can adversely influence their anti-BC efficacies in humans. There have been attempts to resolve these issues, particularly via the employment of NDDSs. Carbon-based represent the major classes of NDDSs that have been exploited for BC therapy. As each of these NDDS classes is associated with different advantages and disadvantages, the selection of the best suited delivery system for a specific natural product is critical. The development of nanoformulation has been reported for all selected natural products. In particular, curcumin has attracted the greatest research interests, where dendro all been employed as NDDSs for curcumin. Generally, an enhancement in anti-BC efficacy and a reduction in toxicity to normal cells have been observed with nanoformulations as opposed to their free counter - parts. These observed benefits are intensified when the surface of nanoformulations are conjugated with targeting ligands (eg, anti-RAGE antibody and BBN) to achieve active BC cell targeting. In addition, nanoformulations of and sulfor - aphane (ie, SF/PEGylated Fe 3O4@AuNPs) also have the tendency to release encapsulated natural products under acidic conditions, which enables the targeting of breast tumours with acidic TME. EGCG-SLNs) sus - tained release properties, thus prolonging the anti-BC actions of these natural products. Notably, nanoformulated I. turpethum (ie, I. turpethum extract-loaded NIPAAM-VP-AA CP-ZEO NE) as well as nanoformulated curcu - (ie, and ellagic nanoparticles) have shown anti-cancer activities in preclinical TNBC models, and thus are highly promising for further devel - opment. Of note, in addition to the surface modification and release properties of nanoformulations mentioned above, other aspects such as the efficiency and cost of their preparation should also be considered to ensure the feasible development of these nanoformulations. Despite the abovementioned promising preclinical findings, however, it is of the utmost importance to estab - lish the biocompatibility or safety profiles of these nano - formulated natural products. While AMSNPs, https: //doi.org/10.2147/IJN.S328135 Dove Press International Journal of Nanomedicine 2021:16 7930Yap et al Dove press Powered been confirmed to be biocompatible with preclinical models by current studies, further studies are required to ascertain the biocompatibility of other nano - formulations in preclinical models and subsequently, all nanoformulations in humans. Additionally, strategies that may further improve the functionality of nanoformulated natural products in humans should also be considered.315 For example, nanoformulations could be tailored to be responsive to biological cues in the TME (eg, pH and redox status) or external cues (eg, magnetic field and ultrasound) for enhancing precision in the delivery and release of natural products. Moreover, the TME could also be reprogrammed to enhance the tumour accumula - tion of nanoformulations. For instance, passive and active tumour targeting of nanoformulations may be improved via the promotion of tumour vascular permeability and the upregulation of receptor expression, respectively. Furthermore, the development of nanoformulations with transcytosis capability may also facilitate deep tumour penetration. These represent some interesting aspects that may be important for the future development of more functional nanoformulated natural products.
