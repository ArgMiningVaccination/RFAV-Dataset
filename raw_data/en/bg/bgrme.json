If participants are on medication for a condition, the medication dose must have been stable for at least 12 weeks preceding vaccination and expected to remain stable for the duration of the study. Participants will be included on the basis of relevant medical history and height and weight measurement at screening. As of Stages 1b and 2b: In the investigator's clinical judgement, participant may have a stable and well-controlled comorbidity associated with an increased risk of progression to severe COVID-19.13 If participants are on medication for a condition, the medication dose must have been stable for at least 12 weeks preceding vaccination and expected to remain stable for the duration of the study.
