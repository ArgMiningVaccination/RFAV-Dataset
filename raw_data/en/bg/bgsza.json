Naturopathic medicine is a rapidly growing. In part due to the staggering numbers of diabetes and other \"diseases of civilization\", many people realize they need to make significant changes to their lifestyle to live healthier and more naturally, including seeking naturopathic options in healthcare. Naturopathy, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), promotes prevention of disease, encouragement of the body's inherent healing abilities, natural treatment of the whole person, personal responsibility for one's health, and education of patients in health-promoting lifestyles. Naturopathy seeks to identify and treat the fundamental cause of the illness and uses centuries-old knowledge of natural therapies combined with most recent advances in the understanding of health and human systems. Nutrition and phyto- and aromatherapy are both therapeutic methods within naturopathy. Naturopathy works in full complementarity with other health, medical and / or paramedical practices. "}
