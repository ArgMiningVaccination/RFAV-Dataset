One may get Lichen Planus on one of more parts of the body. Q fjrigjwwe9r1Faq:QuestionMy doctor said that I have got Lichen Planus after taking some pain killers or anti-blood pressure medicines. I have changes/stopped the said medicine. But, my Lichen Planus is not gone. fjrigjwwe9r1Faq:Answer Well, your Lichen Planus was triggered by some medicines. It may so happen that Lichen Planus may not go on stopping the triggering factor. You need medications. Q fjrigjwwe9r1Faq:QuestionI have been prescribed steroid cream/ steroid tablets/ steroid mouth wash/ steroid gel for my Lichen Planus. It helps me, but the disease returns on stopping the medicine. What does it mean? Q fjrigjwwe9r1Faq:QuestionI was taking cortisone as prescribed by my local doctors. Now, the problem is that whenever I stop it, my Lichen Planus flares up. What is the solution? fjrigjwwe9r1Faq:Answer Cortisone is the most commonly prescribed medicine for Lichen Planus but unfortunately, it is not the most curative medicine. The problem with the use of cortisone is that it gives temporary relief, as long as you use it. Another difficulty created by cortisone is that the disease comes back after stopping cortisone. Third problem is that the resurfaced disease is more difficult to handle that when it started, as it becomes resistant. During the course of the treatment of any disease in which cortisone in any form is used, the major challenge is to handle that period of cortisone withdrawal. Homeopathy certainly helps but it takes time; and it may not be as fast acting as cortisone. The patient has to endure the phase created due to cortisone withdrawal. Slowly, homeopathic medicine takes control of the situation by then the patient may not need cortisone. This may take time. The amount of time it takes to overcome cortisone withdrawal syndrome depends on the following points: a. Amount of cortisone used b. Duration of cortisone use c. Severity of disease d. Duration of the disease. Patient's awareness about this fact and active cooperation helps us to overcome this crisis and treat the disease. Q fjrigjwwe9r1Faq:QuestionYou are claiming on your website that Lichen Planus is curable, while my doctors in the US are saying that it is not curable. fjrigjwwe9r1Faq:Answer As per the conventional medicine Lichen Planus may not be curable. However, homeopathy (the alternative medicine) has a cure for it. We have documented over 2000 cases of Lichen Planus at Life Force, and we can say that Lichen Planus is curable. Ask you doctors to visit the web site and talk to me directly if they have questions. Q fjrigjwwe9r1Faq:QuestionHow does homeopathic medicine work for Lichen Planus? fjrigjwwe9r1Faq:Answer Well, since we do not have clear knowledge about how is Lichen Planus caused, it is difficult to establish how homeopathic medicine cures it. Based on our experience of treating over 2000 cases, we believe that homeopathy works by modulating the altered immune system. Q fjrigjwwe9r1Faq:QuestionHow much time does the treatment take to cure? fjrigjwwe9r1Faq:Answer The length of time to cure Lichen Planus using homeopathy depends on the following factors: a. Duration of Lichen Planus b. Extent c. Probable cause d. Areas affected (only skin, skin and mouth, etc.) e. previous treatment with steroids By and large, milder cases of shorter duration may get cured within 3 to 4 months.
