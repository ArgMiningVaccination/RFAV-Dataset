The individual entries, together with the guides to further reading included in most of them, are oriented especially toward undergradu\u00ad ate students of English, American, and other literatures. Over the decades, however, they have proved to be a useful work of reference also for advanced students, as well as for the general reader with literary interests. The Glossary presents a series of succinct essays in the alphabetic order of the title word or phrase. Terms that are related but subsidiary, or that desig\u00ad nate subclasses, are treated under the title heading of the primary or generic term; also, words that are commonly used in conjunction or as mutually defining contraries (distance and involvement, empathy and sympathy, narrative and narratology) are discussed in the same entry. The alternative organization of a literary handbook as a dictionary of terms, defined singly, makes dull reading and requires excessive repitition and cross-indexing; it may also be misleading, because the use and application of many terms become clear only in the context of other concepts to which they are related, subordinated, or opposed. The essay form makes it feasible to supplement the definition of a term with indications of its changes in meaning over time and of its diversity in current usage, in order to help readers to steer their way through the shift\u00ad ing references and submerged ambiguities of its literary applications. In addi\u00ad tion, the discursive way of treating more or less technical terms provides the author with an opportunity to write entries that are readable as well as useful. In each entry, boldface indicates terms for which the entry provides the prin\u00ad cipal discussion; italics identify terms that occur in the entry but are discussed more fully elsewhere in the Glossary, on pages that are specified in the Index of Terms. The purpose of this new edition is to keep the entries current with the rapid and incessant changes in the literary and critical scene, to take into ac\u00ad count new publications in literature, criticism, and scholarship, and to take advantage of suggestions for improvements and additions, some of them so\u00ad licited by the publisher but many generously volunteered by users of the Glos\u00ad sary. All the entries have been rewritten and a number have been drastically recast, especially those which describe the innovative and rapidly evolving critical theories of the last several decades. All of the revisions aim to make the expositions as lucid and precise as possible, and also to widen the range of VIII PREFACE examples and references, especially of writings by women and by cultural groups that have only recently become prominent. In each entry, the list of suggested readings has been brought up to the date of this revision. Books originally published in non-English languages are listed in their English trans\u00ad lations. This edition discusses more than one-hundred new terms; and in re\u00ad sponse to requests by a number of users, each of the following items has been given a substantial new entry: alienation effect; antihero; author and criticism; Victorian and Victorianism. For the greater convenience of the user, the entries hitherto gathered in a special section, \"Modern Theories of Literature and Criticism,\" have now been distributed into the alphabetic order of the other entries in the Glossary. A new entry, theories of criticism, current, lists the sequence of these move\u00ad ments, together with the approximate time when they became prominent in literary criticism, from Russian formalism in the 1920s and 30s to postcolonial studies and queer theory in the 1990s. An additional feature in this edition, re\u00ad quested by many users, is an Index of Authors, which precedes the Index of Terms at the end of the volume and lists all the significant references in the Glossary to authors and their writings. How to Use the \"\u00c7tossary \" To find the exposition of a literary term or phrase, always look it up in the Index of Terms, which is printed at the end of the volume; to make this Index easy to find, the outside edges of its pages are colored black. Although the separate entries in the Glossary are in the alphabetical order of their title terms, the greater number of terms are defined and discussed within the text of these entries, and so must be located by referring to the Index. In the Index of Terms, readers will find, in boldface, the page number of the principal dis\u00ad cussion of the term; this is followed by the page numbers, in italics, of the oc\u00ad currences of the term in other entries that clarify its meaning and illustrate its functioning in critical usage. (Note that the term referred to by a secondary, italicized reference may be a modified form of the index term; the forms \"par\u00ad odies\" and \"parodie,\" for example, refer to the entry on \"parody.\") Those terms, mainly of foreign origin, that are most likely to be mispronounced by a student are followed by simplified guides to pronunciation; the key to these guides is on the first page of the Index of Terms. Some of the more general or inclusive items in the Index are supple\u00ad mented by a list of closely related terms. These references expedite for the student the fuller exploration of a topic, and also make it easier for a teacher to locate entries that serve the needs of a particular subject of study. For PREFACE IX example, supplementary references identify the separate entries that treat the particular types and movements of literary criticism, the terms most rele\u00ad vant to the analysis of style, the particular entries that define and exemplify the types of figurative language or of literary genres, and the many entries that deal with the forms, component features, history, and critical treatments of the drama, lyric, and novel. # ftdqwivfodgments ^) This edition, like earlier ones, has profited from the suggestions of teach\u00ad ers, and often also students, who proposed changes and additions that would enhance the usefulness of the Glossary to the broad range of courses in Amer\u00ad ican, English, and foreign literatures. I welcome this opportunity to thank Nate Johnson, who served as my research assistant during a postgraduate year at Cornell; his wide-ranging knowledge and critical acumen have led to many improvements in the substance and phrasing of this version of the Glossary. Dianne Ferriss has been of great assistance in preparing and correcting the text of this edition. I am especially grateful for the valuable suggestions by Sean M. Andrews and Francis-No\u00ebl Thomas and by my colleague Jonathan Culler. Claire Brantley, Acquisitions Editor, Camille Adkins, Developmental Editor, Louise Slominsky and Andrea Joy Wright, Project Editors at Harcourt Brace have, firmly but tactfully, instigated and supervised my work on this re\u00ad vision. All these advisers, friends, and co-workers have helped me come closer to the goal announced in the original edition: to write the kind of handbook that I would have found most valuable when, as an undergraduate, I was an eager but sometimes bewildered student of literature and criticism. W A 9{pte to the Reader ^ To find a literary word or phrase, always look it up in the Index of Terms at the end of this volume; the outer edges of this Index are stained black. Although the individual entries in the Glossary are in the alphabetic order of their title terms, the larger number of terms are discussed within the text of these en\u00ad tries, so that the page numbers of these discussions must be located by refer\u00ad ring to the Index. For explanation of the typographical cues in the entries and in the Index, refer to the section of the Preface, above, entitled \"How to Use the Glossary.\" Harcourt College Publishers A Harcourt Higher Learning Company Soon you will find Harcourt Brace's distinguished innovation, leadership, and support under a different name ... a new brand that continues our unsurpassed quality, service, and commitment to education.

The term is applied to a number of works in drama and prose fiction which have in common the sense that the human condition is essentially absurd, and that this condition can be adequately rep\u00ad resented only in works of literature that are themselves absurd. Both the mood and dramaturgy of absurdity were anticipated as early as 1896 in Alfred Jarry's French play Ubu roi {Ubu the King). The literature has its roots also in the movements of expressionism and surrealism, as well as in the fiction, writ\u00ad ten in the 1920s, of Franz Kafka (The Trial, Metamorphosis). The current move\u00ad ment, however, emerged in France after the horrors of World War II, as a rebellion against essential beliefs and values of traditional culture and tradi\u00ad tional literature. This earlier tradition had included the assumptions that human beings are fairly rational creatures who live in an at least partially in\u00ad telligible universe, that they are part of an ordered social structure, and that they may be capable of heroism and dignity even in defeat. After the 1940s, however, there was a widespread tendency, especially prominent in the exis\u00ad tential philosophy of men of letters such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, to view a human being as an isolated existent who is cast into an alien uni\u00ad verse, to conceive the universe as possessing no inherent truth, value, or meaning, and to represent human life\u2014in its fruitless search for purpose and meaning, as it moves from the nothingness whence it came toward the noth\u00ad ingness where it must end\u2014as an existence which is both anguished and ab\u00ad surd. As Camus said in The Myth of Sisyphus (1942), In a universe that is suddenly deprived of illusions and of light, man feels a stranger. His is an irremediable exile... This divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, truly constitutes the feeling of Absurdity. Or as Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, French author of The Bald Soprano (1949), The Lesson (1951), and other plays in the theater of the absurd, has put it: \"Cut off from his religious, metaphysical, and transcendental roots, man is lost; all his ac\u00ad tions become senseless, absurd, useless.\" Ionesco also said, in commenting on the mixture of moods in the literature of the absurd: \"People drowning in meaninglessness can only be grotesque, their sufferings can only appear tragic by derision.\" Samuel Beckett (1906-89), the most eminent and influential writer in this mode, both in drama and in prose fiction, was an Irishman living in Paris who often wrote in French and then translated his works into English. His 2 ACT AND SCENE plays, such as Waiting for Godot (1954) and Endgame (1958), project the irra- tionalism, helplessness, and absurdity of life in dramatic forms that reject re\u00ad alistic settings, logical reasoning, or a coherently evolving plot. Waiting for Godot presents two tramps in a waste place, fruitlessly and all but hopelessly waiting for an unidentified person, Godot, who may or may not exist and with whom they sometimes think they remember that they may have an ap\u00ad pointment; as one of them remarks, \"Nothing happens, nobody comes, no\u00ad body goes, it's awful.\" Like most works in this mode, the play is absurd in the double sense that it is grotesquely comic and also irrational and nonconse- quential; it is a parody not only of the traditional assumptions of Western cul\u00ad ture, but of the conventions and generic forms of traditional drama, and even of its own inescapable participation in the dramatic medium. The lucid but eddying and pointless dialogue is often funny, and pratfalls and other modes of slapstick are used to project the alienation and tragic anguish of human ex\u00ad istence. Beckett's prose fiction, such as Malone Dies (1958) and The Unnamable (1960), present an antihero who plays out the absurd moves of the end game of civilization in a nonwork which tends to undermine the coherence of its medium, language itself. But typically Beckett's characters carry on, even if in a life without purpose, trying to make sense of the senseless and to communi\u00ad cate the uncommunicable. Another French playwright of the absurd was Jean Genet (who combined absurdism and diabolism); some of the early dramatic works of the English\u00ad man Harold Pinter and the American Edward Albee are in a similar mode. The plays of Tom Stoppard, such as Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (1966) and Travesties (1974), exploit the devices of absurdist theater more for comic than philosophical ends. There are also affinities with this movement in the numerous recent works which exploit black comedy or black humor: bale\u00ad ful, naive, or inept characters in a fantastic or nightmarish modern world play out their roles in what Ionesco called a \"tragic farce,\" in which the events are often simultaneously comic, horrifying, and absurd. Examples are Joseph Heller's Catch-22 (1961), Thomas Pynchon's V (1963), John Irving's The World According to Garp (1978), and some of the novels by the German G\u00fcnter Grass and the Americans Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., and John Barth. Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove is an example of black comedy in the cinema. More recently, some playwrights living in totalitarian regimes have used absurdist techniques to register social and political protest. See, for example, Largo Desolato (1987) by the Czech Vaclav Havel and The Island (1973), a collaboration by the South African writers Athol Fugard, John Kani, and Winston Ntshona. See wit, humor, and the comic, and refer to: Martin Esslin, The Theatre of the Absurd (rev., 1968); David Grossvogel, The Blasphemers: The Theatre of Brecht, Ionesco, Beckett, Genet (1965); Arnold P. Hinchliffe, The Absurd (1969); Max F. Schultz, Black Humor Fiction of the Sixties (1980); and Enoch Brater and Ruby Cohn, eds., Around the Absurd: Essays on Modern and Postmodern Drama (1990). Act and Scene. An act is a major division in the action of a play. In England this division was introduced by Elizabethan dramatists, who imitated ancient AESTHETICISM 3 Roman plays by structuring the action into five acts. Late in the nineteenth century a number of writers followed the example of Chekhov and Ibsen by constructing plays in four acts. In the present century the most common form for nonmusical dramas has been three acts. Acts are often subdivided into scenes, which in modern plays usually consist of units of action in which there is no change of place or break in the continuity of time. (Some recent plays dispense with the division into acts and are structured as a sequence of scenes, or episodes.) In the conventional theater with a proscenium arch that frames the front of the stage, the end of a scene is usually indicated by a dropped curtain or a dimming of the lights, and the end of an act by a dropped curtain and an intermission. Aestheticism, or the Aesthetic Movement, was a European phenomenon during the latter nineteenth century that had its chief headquarters in France. In opposition to the dominance of scientific thinking, and in defiance of the widespread indifference or hostility of the middle-class society of their time to any art that was not useful or did not teach moral values, French writers de\u00ad veloped the view that a work of art is the supreme value among human prod\u00ad ucts precisely because it is self-sufficient and has no use or moral aim outside its own being. The end of a work of art is simply to exist in its formal perfection; that is, to be beautiful and to be contemplated as an end in itself. A rallying cry of Aestheticism became the phrase \"l'art pour l'art\"\u2014art for art's sake. The historical roots of Aestheticism are in the views proposed by the Ger\u00ad man philosopher Immanuel Kant in his Critique of Judgment (1790) that the \"pure\" aesthetic experience consists of a \"disinterested\" contemplation of an object that \"pleases for its own sake,\" without reference to reality or to the \"external\" ends of utility or morality. As a self-conscious movement, however, French Aestheticism is often said to date from Th\u00e9ophile Gautier's witty de\u00ad fense of his assertion that art is useless (preface to Mademoiselle de Maupin, 1835). Aestheticism was developed by Baudelaire, who was greatly influenced by Edgar Allan Poe's claim (in \"The Poetic Principle,\" 1850) that the supreme work is a \"poem per se,\" a \"poem written solely for the poem's sake\"; it was later taken up by Flaubert, Mallarm\u00e9, and many other writers. In its extreme form, the aesthetic doctrine of art for art's sake veered into the moral and quasi-religious doctrine of life for art's sake, with the artist represented as a priest who renounces the practical concerns of ordinary existence in the serv\u00ad ice of what Flaubert and others called \"the religion of beauty.\" The views of French Aestheticism were introduced into Victorian En\u00ad gland by Walter Pater, with his emphasis on high artifice and stylistic subtlety, his recommendation to crowd one's life with exquisite sensations, and his ad\u00ad vocacy of the supreme value of beauty and of \"the love of art for its own sake.\" (See his Conclusion to The Renaissance, 1873.) The artistic and moral views of Aestheticism were also expressed by Algernon Charles Swinburne and by English writers of the 1890s such as Oscar Wilde, Arthur Symons, and Lionel Johnson, as well as by the artists J. M. Whistler and Aubrey Beardsley. 4 AFFECTIVE FALLACY \u00b7 ALIENATION EFFECT The influence of ideas stressed in Aestheticism\u2014especially the view of the \"autonomy\" (self-sufficiency) of a work of art, the emphasis on craft and artistry, and the concept of a poem or novel as an end in itself and as invested with \"intrinsic\" values\u2014has been important in the writings of prominent twentieth-century authors such as W. B. Yeats, T. E. Hulme, and T. S. Eliot, as well as in the literary theory of the New Cr\u00ectics. For related developments, see decadence and ivory tower. Refer to: William Gaunt, The Aesthetic Adventure (1945, reprinted 1975); (I960); R. V. Johnson, Aestheticism (1969). For the intellectual and social conditions during the eigh\u00ad teenth century that fostered the theory that a work of art is an end in itself, see M. H. Abrams, \"Art-as-Such: The Sociology of Modern Aesthetics,\" in Doing Things with Texts: Essays in Criticism and Critical Theory (1989). Useful collections of writings in the Aesthetic Movement are Ian Small, ed., The Aes\u00ad thetes: A Sourcebook (1979), and Eric Warner and Graham Hough, eds., Strange\u00ad ness and Beauty: An Anthology of Aesthetic Criticism 1848-1910 (2 vols.; 1983). A useful descriptive guide to books on the subject is Linda C. Dowling, Aes\u00ad theticism and Decadence: A Selective Annotated Bibliography (1977). Affective Fallacy. In an essay published in 1946, W. K. Wimsatt and Mon\u00ad roe C. Beardsley defined the affective fallacy as the error of evaluating a poem by its effects\u2014especially its emotional effects\u2014upon the reader. As a result of this fallacy \"the poem itself, as an object of specifically critical judgment, tends to disappear,\" so that criticism \"ends in impressionism and relativism.\" The two critics wrote in direct reaction to the view of I. A. Richards, in his in\u00ad fluential Principles of Literary Criticism (1923), that the value of a poem can be measured by the psychological responses it incites in its readers. Beardsley has since modified the earlier claim by the admission that \"it does not appear that critical evaluation can be done at all except in relation to certain types of ef\u00ad fect that aesthetic objects have upon their perceivers.\" So modified, the doc\u00ad trine becomes a claim for objective criticism, in which the critic, instead of describing the effects of a work, focuses on the features, devices, and form of the work by which such effects are achieved. An extreme reaction against the doctrine of the affective fallacy was manifested during the 1970s in the devel\u00ad opment of in W. The Verbal Icon (1954); and Monroe C. Beardsley, Aesthetics: Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism (1958), p. 491 and chapter 11. See also Wimsatt and Beardsley's related concept of the intentional fallacy. Alienation Effect. In his epic theater of the 1920s and later, the German dramatist Bertolt Brecht adapted the Russian formalist concept of \"defamiliariza- tion\" into what he called the \"alienation effect\" (Verfremdungseffekt). The Ger\u00ad man term is also translated as estrangement effect or distancing effect; the last is closest to Brecht's notion, in that it avoids the connotation of jadedness, ALLEGORY 5 incapacity to feel, and social apathy that the word \"alienation\" has acquired in English. This effect, Brecht said, is used to make familiar aspects of the present social reality seem strange, so as to prevent the emotional identification or in\u00ad volvement of the audience with the characters and their actions in a play. His aim was instead to evoke a critical distance and attitude in the spectators, in order to arouse them to take action against, rather than simply to accept, the state of society and behavior represented on the stage. On Brecht, refer to Marxist criticism; for a related aesthetic concept, see distance and involvement. Allegory. An allegory is a narrative, whether in prose or verse, in which the agents and actions, and sometimes the setting as well, are contrived by the author to make coherent sense on the \"literal,\" or primary, level of significa\u00ad tion, and at the same time to signify a second, correlated order of signifi\u00ad cation. We can distinguish two main types: (1) Historical and political allegory, in which the characters and actions that are signified literally in their turn represent, or \"allegorize,\" historical personages and events. So in John Dry- den's Absalom and Achitophel (1681), King David represents Charles II, Absa\u00ad lom represents his natural son the Duke of Monmouth, and the biblical story of Absalom's rebellion against his father (2 Samuel 13-18) allegorizes the re\u00ad bellion of Monmouth against King Charles. (2) The allegory of ideas, in which the literal characters represent concepts and the plot allegorizes an abstract doctrine or thesis. Both types of allegory may either be sustained throughout a work, as in Absalom and Achitophel and John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress (1678), or else serve merely as an episode in a nonallegorical work. A famed example of episodic allegory is the encounter of Satan with his daughter Sin, as well as with Death\u2014who is represented allegorically as the son born of their incestuous relationship\u2014in John Milton's Paradise Lost, Book II (1667). In the second type, the sustained allegory of ideas, the central device is the personification of abstract entities such as virtues, vices, states of mind, modes of life, and types of character. In explicit allegories, such reference is specified by the names given to characters and places. Thus Bunyan's The Pil\u00ad grim's Progress allegorizes the Christian doctrine of salvation by telling how the character named Christian, warned by Evangelist, flees the City of De\u00ad struction and makes his way laboriously to the Celestial City; enroute he en\u00ad counters characters with names like Faithful, Hopeful, and the Giant Despair, and passes through places like the Slough of Despond, the Valley of the Shadow of Death, and Vanity Fair. A passage from this work indicates the na\u00ad ture of an explicit allegorical narrative: Now as Christian was walking solitary by himself, he espied one afar off come crossing over the field to meet him; and their hap was to meet just as they were crossing the way of each other. The Gentleman's name was Mr. Worldly-Wiseman; he dwelt in the Town of Carnal-Policy a very great Town, and also hard by from whence Christian came. 6 ALLEGORY Works which are primarily nonallegorical may introduce allegorical im\u00ad agery (the personification of abstract entities who perform a brief allegorical action) in short passages. Familiar instances are the opening lines of Milton's L'Allegro and Penseroso (1645). This device was exploited especially in the po\u00ad etic diction of authors in the mid-eighteenth century. An example\u2014so brief that it presents an allegoric tableau rather than an action\u2014is the passage in Thomas Gray's \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\" (1751): Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust, Or Flatt'ry soothe the dull cold ear of Death? Allegory is a narrative strategy which may be employed in any literary form or genre. The early sixteenth-century Everyman is an allegory in the form of a morality play. The Pilgrim's Progress is a moral and religious allegory in a prose narrative; Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene (1590-96) fuses moral, religious, historical, and political allegory in a verse romance; the third book of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, the voyage to Laputa and Lagado (1726), is an allegorical satire directed mainly against philosophical and scientific pedantry; and William Collins' \"Ode on the Poetical Character\" (1747) is a lyric poem which allegorizes a topic in literary criticism\u2014the nature, sources, and power of the poet's creative imagination. John Keats makes a subtle use of allegory throughout his ode \"To Autumn\" (1820), most explicitly in the sec\u00ad ond stanza, which represents autumn personified as a female figure amid the scenes and activities of the harvest season. Sustained allegory was a favorite form in the Middle Ages, when it pro\u00ad duced masterpieces, especially in the verse-narrative mode of the dream vision, in which the narrator falls asleep and experiences an allegoric dream; this mode includes, in the fourteenth century, Dante's Divine Comedy, the French Roman de la Rose, Chaucer's House of Fame, and William Langland's Piers Plow\u00ad man. But sustained allegory has been written in all literary periods and is the form of such major nineteenth-century dramas in verse as Goethe's Faust, Part II, Shelley's Prometheus Unbound, and Thomas Hardy's The Dynasts. In the present century, the stories and novels of Franz Kafka can be considered in\u00ad stances of implicit allegory. A variety of literary genres may be classified as species of allegory in that they all narrate one coherent set of circumstances which signify a second order of correlated meanings: A fable (also called an apologue) is a short narrative, in prose or verse, that exemplifies an abstract moral thesis or principle of human behavior; usually, at its conclusion, either the narrator or one of the characters states the moral in the form of an epigram. Most common is the beast fable, in which animals talk and act like the human types they represent. In the famil\u00ad iar fable of the fox and the grapes, the fox\u2014after exerting all his wiles to get the grapes hanging beyond his reach, but in vain\u2014concludes that they are probably sour anyway: the express moral is that human beings belittle what they cannot get. (The modern term \"sour grapes\" derives from this fable.) The beast fable is a very ancient form that existed in Egypt, India, and Greece. The ALLEGORY fables in Western cultures derive mainly from the stories attributed to Aesop, a Greek slave of the sixth century B.C. In the seventeenth century a French\u00ad man, Jean de la Fontaine, wrote a set of witty fables in verse which are the classics of this literary kind. Chaucer's \"The Nun's Priest's Tale,\" the story of the cock and the fox, is a beast fable. The American Joe Chandler Harris wrote many Uncle Remus stories that are beast fables, told in southern African- American dialect, whose origins have been traced to folktales in the oral liter\u00ad ature of West Africa that feature a trickster like Uncle Remus' Brer Rabbit. (A trickster is a character in a story who persistently uses his wiliness, and gift of gab, to achieve his ends by outmaneuvering or outwitting other characters.) A counterpart in many North American Indian cultures are the beast fables that feature Coyote as the central trickster. James Thurber's Fables for Our Time (1940) is a recent set of short fables; and in Animal Farm (1945) George Orwell expanded the beast fable into a sustained satire on the political and social sit\u00ad uation in the mid-twentieth century. A parable is a very short narrative about human beings presented so as to stress the tacit analogy, or parallel, with a general thesis or lesson that the nar\u00ad rator is trying to bring home to his audience. The parable was one of Jesus' fa\u00ad vorite devices as a teacher; examples are His parables of the good Samaritan and of the prodigal son. Here is His terse parable of the fig tree, Luke 13:6-9: He spake also this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, \"Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cum- bereth it the ground?\" And he answering said unto him, \"Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it. And if it bears fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.\" Recently Mark Turner, in a greatly extended use of the term, has used \"para\u00ad ble\" to signify any \"projection of one story onto another,\" or onto many oth\u00ad ers, whether the projection is intentional or not. He proposes that, in this extended sense, parable is not merely a literary or didactic device, but \"a basic cognitive principle\" that comes into play in interpreting \"every level of our experience\" and that \"shows up everywhere, from simple actions like telling time to complex literary creations like Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu.\" (Mark Turner, The Literary Mind, New York, 1996.) An exemplum is a story told as a particular instance of the general theme in a religious sermon. The device was popular in the Middle Ages, when exten\u00ad sive collections of exempla, some historical and some legendary, were prepared for use by preachers. In Chaucer's \"The Pardoner's Tale,\" the Pardoner, preach\u00ad ing is the root of all evil,\" incorporates as exemplum the tale of the three drunken revelers who set out to find Death and find a heap of gold instead, only after all to find Death when they kill one another in the attempt to gain sole possession of the treasure. By extension the term \"exem\u00ad plum\" is also applied to tales used in a formal, though nonreligious, exhorta\u00ad tion. Thus preacher's technique in the ten exempla he tells in a vain effort to persuade 8 ALLITERATION his skeptical wife, Dame Pertelote the hen, that bad dreams forebode disaster. See G. R. Owst, Literature and the Pulpit in Medieval England (2nd ed., 1961, chapter 4). Many proverbs (short, pithy statements of widely accepted truths about everyday life) are allegorical in that the explicit statement is meant to have, by analogy or by extended reference, a general application: \"a stitch in time saves nine\"; \"people in glass houses should not throw stones.\" Refer to The Oxford Dictionary of English Proverbs, ed. W. G. Smith and E P. Wilson (1970). See didactic, symbol (for the distinction between allegory and symbol), and (on the fourfold allegorical interpretation of the Bible) interpretation: typo\u00ad logical and allegorical. On allegory in general, consult C. S. Lewis, The Allegory of Love (1936), chapter 2; Edwin Honig, Dark Conceit: The Making of Allegory (1959); Angus Fletcher, Allegory: The of mund Tuve, Allegorical Imagery of Allegory (1969); Maureen Quilligan, The Language of Allegory (1979). Alliteration is the repetition of a speech sound in a sequence of nearby words. The term is usually applied only to consonants, and only when the re\u00ad current sound begins a word or a stressed syllable within a word. In Old En\u00ad glish alliterative meter, alliteration is the principal organizing device of the verse line: the verse is unrhymed; each line is divided into two half-lines of two strong stresses by a decisive pause, or caesura; and at least one, and usu\u00ad ally both, of the two stressed syllables in the first half-line alliterate with the first stressed syllable of the second half-line. (In this type of versification a vowel was considered to alliterate with any other vowel.) A number of Middle English poems, such as William Langland's Piers Plowman and the romance Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, both written in the fourteenth century, contin\u00ad ued to use and play variations upon the old alliterative meter. (See strong-stress meters.) In the opening line of Piers Plowman, for example, all four of the stressed syllables alliterate: In a s\u00f3mer s\u00e9son, when soft was the s\u00f3nne .... In later English versification, however, alliteration is used only for special sty\u00ad listic effects, such as to reinforce the meaning, to link related words, or to pro\u00ad vide tone color and enhance the palpability of enunciating the words. An example is the repetitions of the s, th, and w consonants in Shakespeare's Son\u00ad net 30: When to the sessions of sweet silent thought I summon up remembrance of things past, I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste.... Various other repetitions of speech sounds are identified by special terms: Consonance is the repetition of a sequence of two or more consonants, but with a change in the intervening vowel: live-love, lean-alone, pitter- patter. W. H. Auden's poem of the 1930s, \" where are you going?' said reader to rider,\" makes prominent use of this device; the last stanza reads: ALLUSION 9 \"Out of this looking for you\" said hearer to honor, As he left them there, as he left them there.* Assonance is the repetition of identical or similar vowels\u2014especially in stressed syllables\u2014in a sequence of nearby words. Note the recurrent long i in the opening lines of Keats' \"Ode on a of quietness, Thou foster child of silence and slow time.... The richly assonantal effect at the beginning of William Collins' \"Ode to Evening\" (1747) is achieved by a patterned sequence of changing vowels: If aught of oaten stop or pastoral song, May hope, chaste Eve, to soothe thy pensive ear.... For a special case of the repetition of vowels and consonants in combina\u00ad tion, see rhyme. Allusion is a passing reference, without explicit identification, to a literary or historical person, place, or event, or to another literary work or passage. In the Elizabethan Thomas Nashe's \"Litany in Time of Plague,\" Brightness falls from the air, Queens have died young and fair, Dust hath closed Helen's eye, the unidentified \"Helen\" in the last line alludes to Helen of Troy. Most allu\u00ad sions serve to illustrate or expand upon or enhance a subject, but some are used in order to undercut it ironically by the discrepancy between the subject and the allusion. In the lines from T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land (1922) describ\u00ad ing a woman at her modern dressing table, The Chair she sat in, like a burnished throne, Glowed on the marble,** the ironic allusion, achieved by echoing Shakespeare's phrasing, is to Cleopa\u00ad tra's magnificent barge in Antony and Cleopatra (II. ii. 196 ff.): The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne, Burn'd on the water. For discussion of a poet who makes persistent and complex use of this device, see Reuben A. Brower, Alexander Pope: The Poetry of Allusion (1959); see also John Hollander, The Figure of Echo: A Mode of Allusion in Milton and After (1981); and Edwin Stein, Wordsworth's Art of Allusion (1988). *Lines from \"O where are you going?\" from W.

Most literary allusions are intended to be recognized by the generally educated readers of the author's time, but some are aimed at a special coterie. For example, in Astrophel and Stella, the Elizabethan sonnet sequence, Sir Philip Sidney's punning allusions to Lord Robert Rich, who had married the Stella of the sonnets, were identifiable only by intimates of the people concerned. (See Sonnets 24 and 37.) Some modern authors, including Joyce, Pound, and Eliot, include allusions that are very specialized, or else drawn from the author's pri\u00ad vate reading and experience, in the awareness that few if any readers will rec\u00ad ognize them prior to the detective work of scholarly annotators. The current term intertextuality includes literary echoes and allusions as one of the many ways in which any text is interlinked with other texts. Ambiguity. In ordinary usage \"ambiguity\" is applied to a fault in style; that is, the use of a vague or equivocal expression when what is wanted is preci\u00ad sion and particularity of reference. Since William Empson published Seven Types of Ambiguity (1930), however, the term has been widely used in criticism to identify a deliberate poetic device: the use of a single word or expression to signify two or more distinct references, or to express two or more diverse atti\u00ad tudes or feelings. Multiple meaning and plurisignation are alternative terms for this use of language; they have the advantage of avoiding the pejorative association with the word \"ambiguity.\" When Shakespeare's Cleopatra, exciting the asp to a frenzy, says (Antony and Cleopatra, V. ii. 306 ff.), Come, thou mortal wretch, With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate Of life at once untie. Poor venomous fool, Be angry, and dispatch, her speech is richly multiple in significance. For example, \"mortal\" means \"fatal\" or \"death-dealing,\" and at the same time may signify that the asp is it\u00ad self mortal, or subject to death. \"Wretch\" in this context serves to express both contempt and pity (Cleopatra goes on to refer to the asp as \"my baby at my breast, / That sucks the nurse asleep\"). And the two meanings of \"dis\u00ad patch\"\u2014\"make haste\" and \"kill\"\u2014are equally relevant. A special type of multiple meaning is conveyed by the portmanteau word. The term was introduced into literary criticism by Humpty Dumpty, the expert on semantics in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass (1871). He is explicating to Alice the meaning of the opening lines of \"Jabberwocky\": Twas brillig, and the slimy'.... You see it's like a portmanteau\u2014there are two meanings packed up into one word.\" James Joyce exploited this device\u2014the fusion of two or more existing words\u2014 in order to sustain the multiple levels of meaning throughout his long dream ANTIHERO \u00b7 ANTITHESIS 1 1 narrative Finnegans Wake (1939). An example is his comment on girls who are \"yung and easily freudened\"; \"freudened\" combines \"frightened\" and \"Freud,\" while \"yung\" combines \"young\" and Sigmund Freud's rival in depth psychology, Carl Jung. (Compare pun.) \"Diff\u00e9rance,\" a key analytic term of the philosopher of language Jacques Derrida, is a portmanteau noun which he describes as combining two diverse meanings of the French verb \"diff\u00e9rer\": \"to differ\" and \"to defer.\" (See deconstruct\u00econ.) in analyzing poetic ambiguity, named and en\u00ad larged upon a literary phenomenon that had been noted by some earlier crit\u00ad ics) helped make current a mode of explication developed especially by exponents of the New Criticism, which greatly expanded the awareness by readers of the complexity and richness of poetic language. The risk, at times exemplified by Empson and other recent critics, is that the intensive quest for ambiguities will result in over-reading: ingenious, overdrawn, and some\u00ad times contradictory explications of a literary word or passage. For related terms see connotation and denotation and pun. In addition to Empson, refer to Philip Wheelwright, The Burning Fountain (1954), especially chapter 4. For critiques of Empson's theory and practice, see John Crowe Ran\u00ad som, \"Mr. Empson's Muddles,\" The Southern Review 4 (1938), and Elder Olson, \"William Empson, Contemporary Criticism and Poetic Diction,\" in Critics and Criticism, ed. R. S. Crane (1952). Antihero. The chief person in a modern novel or play whose character is widely discrepant from that which we associate with the traditional protago\u00ad nist or hero of a serious literary work. Instead of manifesting largeness, dignity, power, or heroism, the antihero is petty, ignominious, passive, ineffectual, or dishonest. The use of nonheroic protagonists occurs as early as the picaresque novel of the sixteenth century, and the heroine of Defoe's Moll Flanders (1722) is a thief and a prostitute. The term \"antihero,\" however, is usually applied to writings in the period of disillusion after the Second World War, beginning with such protagonists as we find in John Wain's Hurry on Down (1953) and Kingsley Amis' Lucky Jim (1954). Notable later instances in the novel are Yos- sarian in Joseph Heller's Catch-22 (1961), Tyrone Slothrop in Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow (1973). The antihero is especially conspicuous in dramatic tragedy, in which the protagonist had usually been of high estate, dignity, and courage (see tragedy). Extreme instances are the characters who people a world stripped of certainties, values, or even meaning in Samuel Beckett's dramas\u2014the tramps Vladimir and Estragon in Waiting for Godot (1952) or the blind and paralyzed old man, Hamm, who is the protagonist in Endgame (1958). See literature of the absurd and black comedy, and refer to Ihab Hassan, \"The Antihero in Mod\u00ad ern British and American Fiction,\" in Rumors of Change (1995). Antithesis is a contrast or opposition in the meanings of contiguous phrases or clauses that manifest parallelism\u2014that is, a similar word-order and structure\u2014in their syntax. An example is Alexander Pope's description of 12 ARCHAISM \u00b7 ARCHETYPAL CRITICISM Atticus in his Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot (1735), \"Willing to wound, and yet afraid to strike.\" In the antithesis in the second line of Pope's description of the Baron's designs against Belinda, in The Rape of the Lock (1714), the parallelism in the syntax is made especially prominent by alliteration in the antithetic nouns: Resolved to win, he meditates the way, By /orce to ravish, or by /raud betray. In a sentence from Samuel Johnson's prose fiction Rasselas (1759), chapter 26, the antithesis is similarly heightened by the alliteration in the contrasted nouns: \"Marriage has many pains, but celibacy has no pleasures.\" Archaism. The literary use of words and expressions that have become ob\u00ad solete in the common speech of an era. Spenser in The Faerie Queene (1590-96) deliberately employed archaisms (many of them derived from Chaucer's me\u00ad dieval English) in the attempt to achieve a poetic style appropriate to his re\u00ad vival of the medieval chivalric romance. The translators of the King James Version of the Bible (1611) gave weight, dignity, and sonority to their prose by archaic revivals. Both Spenser and the King James Bible have in their turn been major sources of archaisms in Milton and many later authors. When Keats, for example, in his ode (1820) described the Grecian urn as \"with hrede I Of marble men and maidens overwrought, \" he used archaic words for \"braid\" and \"worked [that is, ornamented] all over.\" Abraham solemnity biblical archaisms in his \"Gettysburg Address,\" which begins, \"Fourscore and seven years ago.\" Archaism has been a standard resort for po\u00ad etic diction. Through the nineteenth century, for example, many poets contin\u00ad ued to use \"I ween,\" \"methought,\" \"steed,\" \"taper\" (for candle), and \"morn,\" but only in their verses, not their everyday speech. Archetypal Criticism. In literary criticism the term archetype denotes re\u00ad current narrative designs, patterns of action, character-types, themes, and im\u00ad ages which are identifiable in a wide variety of works of literature, as well as in myths, dreams, and even social rituals. Such recurrent items are held to be the result of elemental and universal forms or patterns in the human psyche, whose effective embodiment in a literary work evokes a profound response from the attentive reader, because he or she shares the archetypes expressed by the au\u00ad thor. An important antecedent of the literary theory of the archetype was the treatment of myth by a group of comparative anthropologists at Cambridge University, especially James G. Frazer, whose The Golden Bough (1890-1915) identified elemental patterns of myth and ritual that, he claimed, recur in the legends and ceremonials of diverse and far-flung cultures and religions. An even more important antecedent was the depth psychology of Carl G. Jung (1875-1961), who applied the term \"archetype\" to what he called \"primordial images,\" the \"psychic residue\" of repeated patterns of common human experi\u00ad ence in the lives of our very ancient ancestors which, he maintained, survive in ARCHETYPAL CRITICISM the \"collective unconscious\" of the human race and are expressed in myths, re\u00ad ligion, dreams, and private fantasies, as well as in works of literature. See Jungian criticism, under psychoanalytic criticism. Archetypal literary criticism was given impetus by Maud Bodkin's Arche\u00ad typal Patterns in Poetry (1934) and flourished especially during the 1950s and 1960s. Some archetypal critics have dropped Jung's theory of the collective unconscious as the deep source of these patterns; in the words of Northrop Frye, this theory is \"an unnecessary hypothesis,\" and the recurrent archetypes are simply there, \"however they got there.\" Among the prominent practitioners of various modes of archetypal crit\u00ad icism, in addition to Maud Bodkin, are G. Wilson Knight, Robert Graves, Philip Wheelwright, Richard Chase, Leslie Fiedler, and Joseph Campbell. These critics tend to emphasize the occurrence of mythical patterns in litera\u00ad ture, on the assumption that myths are closer to the elemental archetype than the artful manipulations of sophisticated writers (see myth critics). The death- rebirth theme is often said to be the archetype of archetypes, and is held to be grounded in the cycle of the seasons and the organic cycle of human life; this archetype, it has been claimed, occurs in primitive rituals of the king who is annually sacrificed, widespread myths of gods who die to be reborn, and a multitude of diverse texts, including the Bible, Dante's Divine Comedy in the early fourteenth century, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" in 1798. Among the other archetypal themes, images, and charac\u00ad ters that have been frequently traced in literature are the journey under\u00ad ground, the heavenly ascent, the search for the father, the Paradise-Hades image, the Promethean rebel-hero, the scapegoat, the earth goddess, and the fatal woman. In his remarkable and influential book Anatomy of Criticism (1957), Northrop Frye developed the archetypal approach\u2014which he combined with the typological interpretation of the Bible and the conception of the imagination in the writings of the poet and painter William Blake (1757-1827)\u2014into a radi\u00ad cal and comprehensive revision of traditional grounds both of the theory of lit\u00ad erature and the practice of literary criticism. Frye proposes that the totality of literary works constitute a \"self-contained literary universe\" which has been cre\u00ad ated over the ages by the human imagination so as to incorporate the alien and indifferent world of nature into archetypal forms that serve to satisfy enduring human desires and needs. In this literary universe, four radical mythoi (that is, plot forms, or organizing structural principles), correspondent to the four sea\u00ad sons in the cycle of the natural world, are incorporated in the four major genres of comedy (spring), romance (summer), tragedy (autumn), and satire (winter). Within the overarching archetypal mythos of each of these genres, individual works of literature also play variations upon a number of more limited arche\u00ad types\u2014that is, conventional patterns and types that literature shares with social rituals as well as with theology, history, law, and, in fact, all \"discursive verbal structures.\" Viewed archetypally, Frye asserts, literature turns out to play an es\u00ad sential role in refashioning the impersonal material universe into an alternative 14 ATMOSPHERE \u00b7 AUTHOR AND AUTHORSHIP verbal universe that is intelligible and viable, because it is adapted to essential and universal human needs and concerns. Frye continued, in a long series of later writings, to expand his archetypal theory, to make a place in its overall scope and on different levels for the inclusion of many traditional critical con\u00ad cepts and procedures, and to apply it both to social practices and to the elucida\u00ad tion of writings ranging from the Bible to contemporary poets and novelists. See A. C. Hamilton, Northrop Frye: Anatomy of His Criticism (1990). In addition to the works mentioned above, consult: CG. Jung, \"On the Relation of Analytical Psychology to Poetic Art\" (1922), in Contributions to An\u00ad alytical Psychology (1928), and \"Psychology and Literature,\" in Modern Man in Search of a Soul (1933); G. Wilson Knight, The Starlit Dome (1941); Robert Graves, The White Goddess (rev., 1961); Richard Chase, The Quest for Myth (1949); Francis Fergusson, The Idea of a Theater (1949); Philip Wheelwright, The Burning Fountain (rev., Litera\u00ad ture,\" in Fables of Identity (1963); Joseph Campbell, The Hero with a Thousand Faces (2d ed., 1968). In the 1980s, feminist critics developed forms of arche\u00ad typal criticism that revised the male bases and biases of Jung and other arche- typists. See Annis Pratt, Archetypal Patterns in ofjungian Thought (1985). For discussions and critiques of archetypal theory and practice, see H. M. Block, \"Cultural Anthropology and Contemporary Literary Criticism,\" Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 11 (1952); Murray Krieger, ed., Northrop Frye in Modern Criticism (1966); Robert Denham, Northrop Frye and Critical Method (1978); Frank Lentricchia, After the New Criticism (1980), chapter 1. Atmosphere is the emotional tone pervading a section or the whole of a lit\u00ad erary work, which fosters in the reader expectations as to the course of events, whether happy or (more commonly) terrifying or disastrous. Shakespeare es\u00ad tablishes the tense and fearful atmosphere at the beginning of Hamlet by the terse and nervous dialogue of the sentinels as they anticipate a reappearance of the ghost; Coleridge engenders a compound of religious and superstitious terror by his description of the initial scene in the narrative poem Christabel (1816); and Hardy in his novel The Return of the Native (1878) makes Egdon Heath an immense and brooding presence that reduces to pettiness and futil\u00ad ity the human struggle for happiness for which it is the setting. Alternative terms frequently used for atmosphere are mood and ambience. Author and Authorship. The prevailing conception of a literary author might be summarized as follows: Authors are individuals who, by their intel\u00ad lectual and imaginative powers, purposefully create from the materials of their experience and reading a literary work which is distinctively their own. The work itself, as distinct from the individual written or printed texts that in\u00ad stantiate the work, remains solely a product accredited to the author as its originator, even if he or she turns over the rights to publish and profit from the printed texts of the work to someone else. And insofar as the literary work AUTHOR AND AUTHORSHIP 1 5 turns out to be great and original, the author who has composed that work is deservedly accorded high cultural status and achieves enduring fame. Since the 1960s this way of conceiving an author has been questioned by a number of structural and poststructural theorists, who posit the human \"subject\" not as an originator and shaper of a work, but as a \"space\" in which conventions, codes, and circulating locutions precipitate into a particular text, or else as a \"site\" wherein there converge, and are recorded, the cultural constructs, discursive formations, and configurations of power prevalent in a given cultural era. The author is said to be the product rather than the pro\u00ad ducer of a text, and is often redescribed as an \"effect\" or \"function\" engen\u00ad dered by the internal play of textual language. Famously, in 1968 Roland Barthes proclaimed and celebrated \"The Death of the Author,\" whom he de\u00ad scribed as a figure invented by critical discourse in order to limit the inherent freeplay of the meanings in reading a literary text. (See under structuralist crit\u00ad icism and poststructuralism.) In an influential essay \"What Is an Author?\" written in 1969, Michel Fou\u00ad cault raised the question of the historical \"coming into being of the notion of 'author'\"\u2014that is, of the emergence and evolution of the \"author function\" within the discourse of our culture\u2014and specified inquiries such as \"how the author became individualized,\" \"what status he has been given,\" what \"sys\u00ad tem of valorization\" involves the author, and how the fundamental category of \"'the-man-and-his-work criticism' began.\" Foucault's essay and example gave impetus to a number of historical studies which reject the notion that the prevailing concept of authorship (the set of attributes possessed by an au\u00ad thor) is either natural or necessitated by the way things are. Instead, his- toricists conceive authorship to be a \"cultural construct\" that emerged and changed, in accordance with changing economic conditions, social circum\u00ad stances, and institutional arrangements, over many centuries in the Western world. (See new historicism.) Investigators have emphasized the important role of such historical de\u00ad velopments as: (1) The shift from an oral to a literate culture. In the former, the identity of an author presumably was not inquired after, since the individual bard or minstrel improvised by reference to inherited subject-matter, forms, and literary formulae. (See oral formulaic poetry.) In a culture where at least a substantial segment of the population can read, the production of enduring texts in the form of written scrolls and man\u00ad uscripts generated increasing interest in the individual responsible for producing the work that was thus recorded. Many works in manu\u00ad script, however, circulated freely, and were often altered in transcrip\u00ad tions, with little regard to the intentions or formulations of the originator of the work. (2) The shift, in the course of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, from a primarily manuscript culture to a primarily print culture. The in\u00ad vention of printing greatly expedited the manufacture and dissemi\u00ad nation of printed texts, and so multiplied the number of producers of 1 6 AUTHOR AND AUTHORSHIP literary works, and made financially important the establishment of the identity and ability of an individual writer, in order to invite sup\u00ad port for that individual by the contemporary system of aristocratic and noble patronage. Foucault, in addition, proposed the importance of a punitive function in fostering the concept of an author's responsibility in originating a work, which served the interests of the state in affixing the blame for trasgressive or subversive ideas on a single individual. (3) The emphasis in recent research on the difficulties in establishing, in various periods, just who was the originator of what parts of an exist\u00ad ing literary text, which was often, in effect, the product of multiple collaborators, censors, editors, printers, and publishers, as well as of successive revisions by the reputed author. See textual criticism. (4) The proliferation of the population of middle-class readers in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and the attendant explosion in the number of literary titles printed, and in the number of writers re\u00ad quired to supply this market. Both Foucault and Barthes, in the essays cited above, emphasized that the modern figure and function of an author as an individual who is invested with the intellectual owner\u00ad ship of the literary work that he or she has brought into being was the product of the ideology engendered by the emerging capitalist econ\u00ad omy in this era. Other scholars have stressed the importance of the change during the eighteenth century, first in England and then in other European countries, from a reliance by writers on literary pa\u00ad trons to that of support by payments from publishers and booksellers. A result of the booming literary market was the increasing (and in\u00ad creasingly successful) appeal by writers for copyright laws that would invest them, instead of the publisher, with the ownership of the works that they composed for public sale. These conditions of the literary marketplace fostered the claims by writers to possess originality, cre\u00ad ativity, and genius, resulting in literary productions that are entirely new; they made such claims in order to establish their legal rights, as authors, to ownership of such productions as \"intellectual property,\" in addition to their rights (which they could sell to others) to the printed texts of their works as \"material property.\" Historians of au\u00ad thorship point out that the most emphatic claims about the genius, creativity, and originality of authors, which occurred in the Romantic period, coincided with, and was interactive with, the success of authors in achieving some form of copyright protection of an author's propri\u00ad etary rights to the literary work as the unique product of his or her na\u00ad tive powers. (See Martha Woodmansee, The Author, Art, and the Market: Rereading the History of Aesthetics, 1994, and the essays by various scholars in The Construction of Authorship: Textual Appropriation in Law and Literature, ed. Martha Woodmansee and Peter Jaszi, 1994.) Historicist scholars of authorship have clearly demonstrated that there has been a sustained interplay between the economic circumstances and AUTHOR AND AUTHORSHIP institutional arrangements for producing and marketing literary texts and the detailed way that the authorship of such texts has been conceived. The radi\u00ad cal further claim, however, that the modern figure and functions assigned to an author are in their essentials a recent formation, resulting from the dis\u00ad tinctive conditions of the literary marketplace after the seventeenth century, does not jibe with a great deal of historical evidence. Some two thousand years ago, for example, the Roman poet Horace wrote his verse-epistle, the Ars Poetica, at a time when books consisted of texts copied by hand in rolls of pa\u00ad pyrus. Horace adverts to a number of individuals from Homer to his friend Virgil who, he makes clear, as individuals who brought their works into being, are responsible for having achieved their contents, form, and quality. A com\u00ad petent literary author\u2014Horace refers to him variously as scriptor (writer), poeta (maker), and carminis auctor (originator of a poem)\u2014must possess a natural talent or genius (ingenium) as well as an acquired art, and purposefully designs and orders his poema in such a way as to evoke the emotions of his audience. The bookseller, Horace indicates, advertises his commodities locally and also ships them abroad. And if a published work succeeds in instructing and giv\u00ad ing pleasure to a great many readers, it is a book that not only \"makes money for the bookseller/' but also \"crosses the sea and spreads to a distant age the fame of its author.\" Clearly, Horace distinguishes between material and au\u00ad thorial, or intellectual, ownership, in that the author, even if he has no pro\u00ad prietary interest in a published book, retains the sole responsibility and credit for having accomplished the work that the text of the book incorporates. (See M. H. Abrams, \"What Is a Humanistic Criticism?\" in The Emperor Redressed: Critiquing Critical Theory, ed. Dwight Eddins, 1995.) Another revealing instance is provided by the publication of the First Folio of Shakespeare's plays in 1623. As writings intended for the commercial theater, Shakespeare's plays were a collaborative enterprise in which textual changes and insertions could be made by various hands at all stages of pro\u00ad duction; the resulting products were not Shakespeare's property, but that of his theatrical company. Furthermore, as Stephen Greenblatt remarks in the Introduction to The Norton Shakespeare (1997), there is no evidence that Shakespeare himself wanted to have his plays printed, or that he took any \"interest in asserting authorial rights over a script,\" or that he had any legal standing from which to claim such rights. Nonetheless, as Greenblatt points out, seven years after Shakespeare's death his friends and fellow-actors Heminges and Condell were confident that they could sell their expensive folio collection of his plays by virtue of the fact, as they claimed in a preface, that their printed texts were exactly \"as he conceived them\" and represented what he himself had \"thought\" and \"uttered.\" The identity of the conceiver of the plays, serving to attest the authenticity of the printed versions, is graphically represented in an engraved portrait of Shakespeare by Martin Droeshout in the front matter. The First Folio also included a poem by Ben Jonson, Shakespeare's friend and dramatic rival, \"To the Memory of My Beloved, The Author Mr. William Shakespeare.\" In it Jonson appraised Shake\u00ad speare as the equal of the Greek tragic dramatists Aeschylus, Euripedes, and 18 BALLAD Sophocles; lauded him as only \"The applause! delight! the wonder of our stage!\" but also as an individual who, by the products of his innate abilities (\"nature\") even more than his \"art,\" was \"not of an age, but for all time!\"; and asserted that his \"well-turned\" lines reflect the \"mind, and manners\" of the poet who had fathered them. It would seem that, in large outline, the figure and functions of Horace's \"auctor\" and of Jonson's \"author\" were recogniz\u00ad ably what they are at the present time, in ordinary critical discourse. In addition to the items listed above, refer to Frederick G. Kenyon, Books and Readers in Ancient Rome (1951); A. J. Minnis, Medieval Theory of Authorship (1984); Wendy Wall, The Imprint of Gender: Authorship and Publication in the English Renaissance (1993). Roger Chartier, in \"Figures of the Author,\" The Order of Books (1994), describes the diverse functions assigned to an individual author, from the late middle ages through the eighteenth century. Ballad. A short definition of the popular ballad (known also as the folk ballad or traditional ballad) is that it is a song, transmitted orally, which tells a story. Ballads are thus the narrative species of folk songs, which origi\u00ad nate, and are communicated orally, among illiterate or only partly literate people. In all probability the initial version of a ballad was composed by a sin\u00ad gle author, but he or she is unknown; and since each singer who learns and re\u00ad peats an oral ballad is apt to introduce changes in both the text and the tune, it exists in many variant forms. Typically, the popular ballad is dramatic, con\u00ad densed, and impersonal: the narrator begins with the climactic episode, tells the story tersely by means of action and dialogue (sometimes by means of the dialogue alone), and tells it without self-reference or the expression of per\u00ad sonal attitudes or feelings. The most common stanza form\u2014called the ballad stanza\u2014is a quatrain in alternate four- and three-stress lines; usually only the second and fourth lines rhyme. This is the form of \"Sir Patrick Spens\"; the first stanza of this bal\u00ad lad also exemplifies the conventionally abrupt opening and the manner of proceeding by third-person narration, curtly sketched setting and action, sharp transition, and spare dialogue: The king sits in Dumferling towne, Drinking the blude-red wine: \"O whar will I a guid sailor, To sail this schip of mine?\" Many ballads employ set formulas (which helped the singer remember the course of the song) including (1) stock descriptive phrases like \"blood-red wine\" and \"milk-white steed,\" (2) a refrain in each stanza (\"Edward,\" \"Lord Randall\"), and (3) incremental repetition, in which a line or stanza is re\u00ad peated, but with an addition that advances the story (\"Lord Randall,\" \"Child Waters\"). (See oral formulaic poetry.) Although many traditional ballads probably originated in the later Mid\u00ad dle Ages, they were not collected and printed until the eighteenth century, BALLAD first in England, then in Germany. In 1765 Thomas Percy published his Reliques of Ancient English Poetry which, although most of the contents had been rewritten in the style of Percy's era, did much to inaugurate widespread interest in folk literature. The basic modern collection is Francis J. Child's En\u00ad glish and Scottish Popular Ballads (1882-98), which includes 305 ballads, many of them in variant versions. Bertrand H. Bronson has edited The Traditional Tunes of the Child Ballads (4 vols., 1959-72). Popular ballads are still being sung\u2014and collected, now with the help of a tape recorder\u2014in the British Isles and remote rural areas of America. To the songs that early settlers inherited from Great Britain, America has added native forms of the ballad, such as those sung by lumberjacks, cowboys, laborers, and social protesters. A num\u00ad ber of recent folk singers, including Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan, and Joan Baez, themselves compose ballads; most of these, however, such as \"The Bal\u00ad lad of Bonnie and Clyde\" (about a notorious gangster and his moll), are closer to the journalistic \"broadside ballad\" than to the archaic and heroic mode of the popular ballads in the Child collection. A broadside ballad is a ballad that was printed on one side of a single sheet (called a \"broadside\"), dealt with a current event or person or issue, and was sung to a well-known tune. Beginning with the sixteenth century, these broadsides were hawked in the streets or at country fairs in Great Britain. The traditional ballad has greatly influenced the form and style of lyric poetry in general. It has also engendered the literary ballad, which is a nar\u00ad rative poem written in deliberate imitation of the form, language, and spirit of the traditional ballad. In Germany, some major literary ballads were writ\u00ad ten in the latter eighteenth century, including G. A. Burger's very popular \"Lenore\" (1774)\u2014which soon became widely read in an En\u00ad glish translation\u2014and Goethe's \"Erlk\u00f6nig\" (1782). In England, some of the best literary ballads were composed in the Romantic Period: Coleridge's \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" (which, however, is much longer and has a much more elaborate plot than the folk ballad), Walter Scott's \"Proud a as an agent and first-person teller of the story\u2014\"I met a little cottage girl\"\u2014which is probably one reason he called the collection \"lyrical ballads.\" Coleridge's \"Ancient Mariner,\" on the other hand, of which the first version also appeared in Lyrical Ballads, opens with the abrupt and impersonal third-person narration the tradi\u00ad tional ballad: It is an ancient Mariner And he stoppeth one of three....

The style employs the clas\u00ad sical forms of the Renaissance, but breaks them up and intermingles them to achieve elaborate, grandiose, energetic, and highly dramatic effects. Major ex\u00ad amples of baroque art are the sculpture of Bernini and the architecture of St. Peter's cathedral in Rome. The term has been adopted with reference to literature, with very diverse applications. It may signify any elaborately formal and magniloquent style in verse or prose\u2014for example, some verse passages in Milton's Paradise Lost (1667) and Thomas De Quincey's prose descriptions of his dreams in Confes\u00ad sions of an English Opium Eater (1822) have both been called baroque. Occa\u00ad sionally\u2014though ottener on the Continent than in England\u2014it serves as a period term for post-Renaissance literature in the seventeenth century. More frequently it is applied specifically to the elaborate verses and extravagant conceits of the late-sixteenth and early seventeenth-century poets Giambat\u00ad tista Marino in Italy and Luis de Gongora in Spain. In English literature the metaphysical poems of John Donne are sometimes described as baroque; but the term is more often, and more appropriately, applied to the elaborate style, fantastic conceits, and extreme religious emotionalism of the poet Richard Crashaw, 1612-49; see under metaphysical conceit. Refer to Ren\u00e9 Wellek, \"The Concept of Baroque in Literary Scholarship,\" in Concepts of Criticism (1963). The term \"baroque\" is derived from the Spanish and Portuguese name for a pearl that is rough and irregular in shape. Bathos and Anticlimax. Bathos is Greek for \"depth,\" and it has been an indispensable term to critics since Alexander Pope, parodying the Greek Long- inus' famous essay On the Sublime (that is, \"loftiness\"), wrote in 1727 an essay On Bathos: Of the Art of Sinking in Poetry. With mock solemnity Pope assures his readers that he undertakes \"to lead them as it were by the hand ... the gentle down-hill way to Bathos; the bottom, the end, the central point, the non plus ultra, of true Modern Poesy!\" The word ever since has been used for an unin\u00ad tentional descent in literature when, straining to be pathetic or passionate or elevated, the writer overshoots the mark and drops into the trivial or the ridiculous. Among his examples Pope cites \"the modest request of two absent lovers\" in a contemporary poem: Ye Gods! annihilate but Space and Time, And make two lovers happy. The slogan \"For God, for Country, and for Yale!\" is bathetic because it moves to intended climax (that is, an ascending sequence of importance) in its rhetorical order, but to unintended descent in its reference\u2014at least for some\u00ad one who is not a Yale student. Even great poets sometimes fall unwittingly into the same rhetorical figure. In the early version of The Prelude (1805; Book BEAT WRITERS 21 IX), William Wordsworth, after recounting at length the tale of the star- crossed lovers Vaudracour and Julia, tells how Julia died, leaving Vaudracour to raise their infant son: It consoled him here To attend upon the Orphan and perform The office of a Nurse to his young Child Which after a short time by some mistake Or indiscretion of the Father, died. The Stuffed Owl: An Anthology of Bad Verse, ed. D. B. Wyndham Lewis and Charles Lee (rev. 1948), is a rich mine of unintended bathos. Anticlimax is sometimes used as an equivalent of bathos; but in a more useful application, \"anticlimax\" is non-derogatory, and denotes a writer's de\u00ad liberate drop from the serious and elevated to the trivial and lowly, in order to achieve a comic or satiric effect. Thus Thomas Gray in his mock-heroic \"Ode on the Death of a Favorite Cat\" (1748)\u2014the cat had drowned when she tried to catch a goldfish\u2014gravely inserts this moral observation: What female heart can gold despise? What cat's averse to fish? And in Don Juan (1819-24; I. ix.) Byron uses anticlimax to deflate the would- be gallantry of Juan's father: A better cavalier ne'er mounted horse, Or, being mounted, e'er got down again. Beat Writers identifies a loose-knit group of poets and novelists, writing in the second half of the 1950s and early 1960s, who shared a set of social atti\u00ad tudes\u2014antiestablishment, antipolitical, anti-intellectual, opposed to the pre\u00ad vailing cultural, literary, and moral values, and in favor of unfettered self-realization and self-expression. The Beat writers often performed in coffee\u00ad houses and other public places, to the accompaniment of drums or jazz music. \"Beat\" was used to signify both \"beaten down\" (that is, by the oppres\u00ad sive culture of the time) and \"beatific\" (many of the Beat writers cultivated ec\u00ad static states by way of Buddhism, Jewish and Christian mysticism, and/or drugs that induced visionary experiences). The group included such diverse figures as the poets Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, and Lawrence Ferlinghetti and the novelists William Burroughs and Jack Kerouac. Ginsberg's Howl (1956) is a central Beat achievement in its breathless, chanted celebration of the down-and-out and the subculture of drug addicts, social misfits, and com\u00ad pulsive wanderers, as well as in its representation of the derangement of the intellect and the senses effected by a combination of sexual abandon, drugged hallucinations, and religious ecstasies. (Compare the vogue of decadence in the late nineteenth century.) A representative novel of the movement is Jack Ker- ouac's On the Road (1958). While the Beat movement was short-lived, it left its imprint on the subjects and forms of many writers of the 1960s and 1970s; see counterculture, under Periods of American Literature. 22 BIOGRAPHY Refer to Lawrence Lipton, The Holy Barbarians (1959); Seymour Krim, ed., The Beats (1960); Gregory Stephenson, The Daybreak Boys: Essays on the Litera\u00ad ture of the Beat Generation (1989). Biography. Late in the seventeenth century, John Dryden defined biogra\u00ad phy neatly as \"the history of particular men's lives.\" The name now connotes a relatively full account of a particular person's life, involving the attempt to set forth character, temperament, and milieu, as well as the subject's activities and experiences. Both the ancient Greeks and Romans produced short, formal lives of in\u00ad dividuals. The most famed surviving example is the Parallel Lives of Greek and Roman notables by the Greek writer Plutarch, c. 46-120 A.D.; in the transla\u00ad tion by Sir Thomas North in 1579, it was the source of Shakespeare's plays on Roman subjects. Medieval authors wrote generalized chronicles of the deeds of a king, as well as hagiographies: the stylized lives of Christian saints, often based much more on pious legends than on fact. In England, the fairly de\u00ad tailed secular biography appeared in the seventeenth century; the most dis\u00ad tinguished instance is Izaak Walton's Lives (including short biographies of the poets John Donne and George Herbert), written between 1640-78. The eighteenth century in England is the age of the emergence of the full-scale biography, and also of the theory of biography as a special literary genre. It was the century of Samuel Johnson's Lives of the English Poets (1779-81) and of the best known of all biographies, James Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson (1791). In our own time biographies of notable women and men have become one of the most popular of literary forms, and usually there is at least one biographical title high on the bestseller list. Autobiography is a biography written by the subject about himself or herself. It is to be distinguished from the memoir, in which the emphasis is not on the author's developing self but on the people and events that the au\u00ad thor has known or witnessed, and also from the private diary or journal, which is a day-to-day record of the events in one's life, written for personal use and satisfaction, with little or no thought of publication. Examples of the latter type are the seventeenth-century diaries of Samuel Pepys and John Eve\u00ad lyn, the eighteenth-century journals of James Boswell and Fanny Burney, and Dorothy Wordsworth's remarkable Journals, written 1798-1828, but not pub\u00ad lished until long after her death. The first fully developed autobiography is also the most influential: the Confessions of St. Augustine, written in the fourth century. The design of this profound and subtle spiritual autobiogra\u00ad phy centers on what became the crucial experience in Christian autobiogra\u00ad phy: the author's anguished mental crisis, and a recovery and conversion in which he discovers his Christian identity and religious vocation. Michel de Montaigne's Essays, published in 1580 and in later expan\u00ad sions, constitute in their sum the first great instance of autobiographical self- revelation that is presented for its inherent interest, rather than for religious or didactic purposes. Among later distinguished achievements in primarily secular autobiography are Rousseau's Confessions, written 1764-70, Goethe's BLACK ARTS MOVEMENT 23 Dichtung Truth\"), written 1810-31, and the autobi\u00ad ographies of Benjamin Franklin, Henry Adams, Sean O'Casey, Lillian Hellman, and Gertrude Stein (published in 1933 under the title The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas). Many spiritual histories of the self, however, like John Bunyan's Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners (1666), followed Augustine's example of religious self-revelation centering on a crisis and conversion. An important off\u00ad shoot of this type are secular autobiographies that represent a spiritual crisis which is resolved by the author's discovery of his identity and vocation, not as a Christian, but as a poet or artist; examples are Wordsworth's autobiography in verse, The Prelude (completed 1805, published in revised form 1850), or the partly autobiographical works of prose fiction such as Marcel Proust's \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu (1913-27), James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1915), and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man (1965). In recent years, the dis\u00ad tinction between autobiography and fiction has become more and more blurred, as authors include themselves under their own names in novels and autobiographies are written in the asserted mode of fiction, or (like Maxine Hong Kingston's The Woman Warrior, 1975) mingle fiction and personal expe\u00ad rience as a way to get at one's essential life story (see under novel).

Morris, in Versions of the Self: Studies in English Autobiography from John Bunyan to John Stuart Mill (1966), deals both with reli\u00ad gious and secular spiritual autobiographies. M. H. Abrams, in Natural Super- naturalism (1971), narrates the history of spiritual autobiography and describes the wide ramifications of the type in historical and philosophical as well as literary forms. Black Arts Movement designates a number of African-American writers whose work was shaped by the social and political turbulence of the 1960s\u2014 the decade of massive protests against the Vietnam War, militant demands for the rights of blacks that led to repeated and sometimes violent confrontations, and the riots and burnings in Los Angeles, Detroit, New York, Newark, and other major cities. The literary movement was associated with the Black Power movement in politics, whose spokesmen, including Stokely Carmichael and Malcolm X, opposed the proponents of integration and assimilation, and in\u00ad stead advocated black separatism, black pride, and black solidarity. Representa\u00ad tives of the Black Arts put their literary writings at the service of these social and political aims. As Larry Neal put it in his essay \"The Black Arts Movement\" 24 BLANK VERSE (1968): \"Black Art is the aesthetic and spiritual sister of the Black Power Con\u00ad cept. As such it envisions an art that speaks directly to the needs and aspirations of Black America\" and \"to the Afro-American desire for self-determination and nationhood.\" The Black Aesthetic that was voiced or supported by representative writ\u00ad ers in the movement rejected, as aspects of domination by white culture, the \"high art\" and modernist forms advocated by Ralph Ellison and other African-American writers in the 1950s. Instead, the black aesthetic called for the exploitation of the energy and freshness of the black vernacular, in rhythms and moods emulating jazz and the blues, applied especially to the lives and concerns of lower-class blacks, and addressed specifically to a black mass audience. (See Addison Gayle, The Black Aesthetic, 1971.) The most no\u00ad table and influential practitioner of the Black Arts was Imamu Amiri Baraka (born LeRoi Jones) who, after an early period as an associate, in Greenwich Village, of Allen Ginsberg and other Beat writers, moved to Harlem, where he founded the Black Arts Repertory Theater/School in 1965. Baraka was distin\u00ad guished as a poet, a dramatist (his play Dutchman is often considered an ex\u00ad emplary product of the Black Arts achievement), a political essayist, and a critic both of literature and of jazz music. Among other notable writers of the movement were the poets Etheredge Knight, Sonia Sanchez, Haki Madhubuti, and Nikki Giovanni; the authors of prose fiction John Alfred Williams, El- dridge Cleaver, and James Alan McPherson; and the playwrights Paul Carter Harrison and Ed Bullins. The revolutionary impetus of the Black Arts movement had diminished by the 1970s, and some of its pronouncements and achievements now seem undisciplined and too blatantly propagandistic. But its best writings survive, and their critical rationale and subject-matter have served as models not only to later African-American writers, but also to Native American, Latino, Asian, and other ethnic writers in America. The Black Aesthetic, ed. Addison Gayle (1972), includes essays that were important in establishing this mode of criticism by Ron Karenga, Don L. Lee, and Larry Neal, as well as by Gayle himself.

Blank Verse consists of lines of iambic pentameter (five-stress iambic verse) which are unrhymed\u2014hence the term \"blank.\" Of all English metrical forms it is closest to the natural rhythms of English speech, and at the same time flexible and adaptive to diverse levels of discourse; as a result it has been more frequently and variously used than any other type of versification. Soon after blank verse was introduced by the Earl of Surrey in his translations of Books 2 and 4 of Virgil's The Aeneid (about 1540), it became the standard meter for Elizabethan and later poetic drama; a free form of blank verse is still the BOMBAST 25 medium in such twentieth-century verse plays as those by Maxwell Anderson and T. S. Eliot. John Milton used blank verse for his epic Paradise Lost (1667), James Thomson for his descriptive and philosophical Seasons (1726-30), William Wordsworth for his autobiographical Prelude (1805), Alfred, Lord Ten\u00ad nyson for the narrative Idylls of the King (1891), Robert Browning for The Ring and the Book (1868-69) and many dramatic monologues, and T. S. Eliot for much of The Waste Land (1922). A large number of meditative lyrics, from the Romantic Period to the present, have also been written in blank verse, includ\u00ad divided into five-line stanzas), and Wallace Stevens' \"Sunday Morning.\" Divisions in blank verse poems, used to set off a sustained passage, are called verse paragraphs. See, for example, the great verse paragraph of twenty-six lines which initiates Milton's Paradise Lost, beginning with \"Of man's first disobedience\" and ending with \"And justify the ways of God to men\"; also, the opening verse paragraph of twenty-two lines in Wordsworth's \"Tintern Abbey\" (1798), which begins: Five years have past; five summers, with the length Of five long winters! and again I hear These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs With a soft inland murmur. See meter, and refer to Moody Prior's critical study of blank verse in The Language of Tragedy (1964). Bombast denotes a wordy and inflated diction that is patently dispropor\u00ad tionate to the matter that it signifies. The high style of even so fine a poet as Christopher Marlowe is at times inappropriate to its sense, as when Faustus declares (Dr. Faustus, 1604; III. i. 47 ff.): Now by the kingdoms of infernal rule, Of Styx, Acheron, and the fiery lake Of ever-burning Phlegethon I swear That I do long to see the monuments And situation of bright-splendent Rome; which is to say: \"By Hades, I'd like to see Rome!\" Bombast is a frequent com\u00ad ponent in the heroic drama of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth cen\u00ad turies. The pompous language of that drama is parodied in Henry Fielding's Tom Thumb the Great (1731), as in the noted opening of Act II. v., in which the diminutive male lover cries: Oh! Huncamunca, Huncamunca, oh! Thy pouting breasts, like kettle-drums of brass, Beat everlasting loud alarms of joy; As bright as brass they are, and oh! as hard; Oh! Huncamunca, Huncamunca, oh! Fielding points out in a note that this passage was a parody of James Thom\u00ad son's lines in The Tragedy ofSophonisba (1730): 26 Oh! Sophonisba, \"Bombast\" originally meant \"cotton stuffing,\" and in Elizabethan times came to be used as a metaphor for an over-elaborate style. Bowdlerize. To delete from an edition of a literary work passages consid\u00ad ered by the editor to be indecent or indelicate. The word derives from the Reverend Thomas Bowdler, who tidied up his Family Shakespeare in 1818 by omitting, as he put it, \"whatever is unfit to be read by a gentleman in a com\u00ad pany of ladies.\" Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726), Shakespeare's plays, and The Arabian Nights are often bowdlerized in editions intended for the young; and until the 1920s, at which time the standards of propriety were drastically liberalized, some compilers of anthologies for college students availed themselves of Bowdler's prerogative in editing Chaucer. Burlesque has been succinctly defined as \"an incongruous imitation\"; that is, it imitates the manner (the form and style) or else the subject matter of a serious literary work or a literary genre, in verse or in prose, but makes the im\u00ad itation amusing by a ridiculous disparity between the manner and the matter. The burlesque may be written for the sheer fun of it; usually, however, it is a form of satire. The butt of the satiric ridicule may be the particular work or the genre that is being imitated, or else the subject matter to which the imitation is incongruously applied, or (often) both of these together. \"Burlesque,\" \"parody,\" and \"travesty\" are sometimes applied inter\u00ad changeably; simply to equate these terms, however, is to surrender useful crit\u00ad ical distinctions. It is better to follow the critics who use \"burlesque\" as the generic name and use the other terms to discriminate species of burlesque; we must keep in mind, however, that a single instance of burlesque may exploit a variety of techniques. The application of these terms will be clearer if we make two preliminary distinctions: (1) In a burlesque imitation, the form and style may be either lower or higher in level and dignity than the subject to which it is incongruously applied. (See the discussion of levels under style.) If the form and style are high and dignified but the subject is low or trivial, we have \"high burlesque\"; if the subject is high in status and dignity but the style and manner of treatment are low and undignified, we have \"low burlesque.\" (2) A burlesque may also be distinguished according to whether it imitates a general literary type or genre, or else a particular work or author. Applying these two distinctions, we get the following species of burlesque. I Varieties of high burlesque: (1) A parody imitates the serious manner and characteristic features of a particular literary work, or the distinctive style of a particular author, or the typical stylistic and other features of a serious literary genre, and deflates the original by applying the imitation to a lowly or com\u00ad ically inappropriate subject. John Phillips' \"The Splendid Shilling\" (1705) the epic style of John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667) by BURLESQUE 27 exaggerating its high formality and applying it to the description of a tattered poet composing in a drafty attic. Henry Fielding in Joseph An\u00ad drews (1742) parodied Samuel Richardson's novel Pamela (1740-41) by putting a hearty male hero in place of Richardson's sexually belea\u00ad guered heroine, and later on Jane Austen poked good-natured fun at the genre of the gothic novel in Northanger Abbey (1818). Here is Hart\u00ad ley Coleridge's parody of the first stanza of William Wordsworth's \"She Dwelt among the Untrodden Ways,\" which himself: He lived amidst th' untrodden ways To Rydal Lake that lead, A bard whom there were none to praise, And very few to read. From the early nineteenth century to the present, parody has been the favorite form of burlesque. Among the gifted parodists of the present century have been Max Beerbohm in England (see his A Christmas Gar\u00ad land, 1912) and Stella Gibbons (Cold Comfort Farm, 1936), and the American writers James Thurber, Phyllis McGinley, and E. B. White. The novel Possession (1990), by the English writer A. S. Byatt, exempli\u00ad fies a serious literary form which includes straight-faced parodies of Victorian poetry and prose, as well as of academic scholarly writings. (2) A mock epic or mock-heroic poem is distinguished as that type of parody which imitates, in a sustained way, both the elaborate form and the ceremonious style of the epic genre, but applies it to narrate at length a commonplace or trivial subject matter. In a masterpiece of this type, The Rape of the Lock (1714), Alexander Pope views through the grandiose epic perspective a quarrel between the belles and ele\u00ad gants of his day over the theft of a lady's curl. The story includes such elements of traditional epic protocol as supernatural machinery, a voy\u00ad age on board ship, a visit to the underworld, and a heroically scaled battle between the sexes\u2014although with metaphors, hatpins, and snuff for weapons. The term mock-heroic is often applied to other dig\u00ad nified poetic forms which are purposely mismatched to a lowly sub\u00ad ject; for example, to Thomas Gray's comic \"Ode on the Death of a Favorite Cat\" (1748); see under bathos and anticlimax. II Varieties of low burlesque: (1 ) The Hudibrastic poem takes its name from Samuel Butler's Hudibras (1663), which satirized rigid Puritanism by describing the adventures of a Puritan knight, Sir Hudibras. Instead of the doughty deeds and dignified style of the traditional genre of the chivalric romance, how\u00ad ever, we find the knightly hero experiencing mundane and humiliat\u00ad ing misadventures which are described in doggerel verses and a ludicrously colloquial idiom. (2) The travesty mocks a particular work by treating its lofty subject in a grotesquely undignified manner and style. As Boileau put it, describing 28 CANON OF LITERATURE a travesty of Virgil's Aeneid, \"Dido and Aeneas are made to speak like fishwives and ruffians.\" The New Yorker once published a travesty of Ernest Hemingway's novel Across the River and Into the Trees (1950) with the title Aaoss the Street and Into the Bar, and the film Young Frankenstein is a travesty of Mary Shelley's novel Frankenstein. Another form of burlesque is the lampoon: a short satirical work, or a passage in a longer work, which describes the appearance and character of a particular person in a way that makes that person ridiculous. It typically em\u00ad ploys caricature, which in a verbal description (as in graphic art) exaggerates or distorts, for comic effect, a person's distinctive physical features or person\u00ad ality traits. John Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel (1681) includes a famed twenty-five-line lampoon of Zimri (Dryden's contemporary the Duke of Buck\u00ad ingham), which begins: In the first rank of these did Zimri stand; A man so various, that he seemed to be Not one, but all mankind's epitome: Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong; Was everything by starts, and nothing long.... The modern sense of \"burlesque\" as a theater form derives, historically, from plays which mocked serious types of drama by an incongruous imita\u00ad tion. John Gay's Beggar's Opera (1728)\u2014which in turn became the model for the German Threepenny Opera by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill (1928)\u2014was a high burlesque of Italian opera, applying its dignified formulas to a company of beggars and thieves; a number of the musical plays by Gilbert and Sullivan in the Victorian era also burlesqued grand opera.

The Greek word \"kanon,\" signifying a measuring rod or a rule, was extended to denote a list or catalogue, then came to be applied to the list of books in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament which were designated by church authorities as the genuine Holy Scriptures. A number of writings related to those in the Scriptures, but not admitted into the authori\u00ad tative canon, are called apocrypha; eleven books which have been included in the Roman Catholic biblical canon are considered apocryphal by Protes\u00ad tants. The term \"canon\" was later used in a literary application to signify the list of secular works accepted by experts as genuinely written by a particular author. We speak thus of \"the Chaucer canon\" and \"the Shakespeare canon,\" and refer to other works that have sometimes been attributed to an author, but on evidence that many editors judge to be inadequate or invalid, as CANON OF LITERATURE \"apocryphal.\" In recent decades the phrase literary canon has come to desig\u00ad nate\u2014in world literature, or in European literature, but most frequently in a national literature\u2014those authors who, by a cumulative consensus of critics, scholars, and teachers, have come to be widely recognized as \"major,\" and to have written works often hailed as literary classics. The literary works by canonical authors are the ones which, at a given time, are most kept in print, most frequently and fully discussed by literary critics and historians, and most likely to be included in anthologies and in the syllabi of college courses with titles such as \"World Masterpieces,\" \"Major English Authors,\" or \"Great American Writers.\" The use of the term \"canon\" with reference both to the Bible and to sec\u00ad ular writings obscures important differences in the two applications. The bib\u00ad lical canon has been established by church authorities vested with the power to make such a decision; is enforced by authorities with the power to impose religious sanctions; is explicit in the books that it lists; and is closed, permit\u00ad ting neither deletions nor additions. (See the entry \"Canon\" in The Oxford Companion to the Bible, 1993.) The canon of literature, on the other hand, is the product of a wavering and unofficial consensus; it is tacit rather than ex\u00ad plicit, loose in its boundaries, and always subject to changes in its inclusions. The social process by which an author or a literary work comes to be tac\u00ad itly recognized as canonical has come to be called \"canon formation.\" The factors in this formative process are complex and disputed. It seems clear, however, that the process involves, among other conditions, a broad concur\u00ad rence of critics, scholars, and authors with diverse viewpoints and sensibili\u00ad ties; the persistent influence of, and reference to, an author in the work of other authors; the frequent reference to an author or work within the dis\u00ad course of a cultural community; and the widespread assignment of an author or text in school and college curricula. Such factors are of course mutually in\u00ad teractive, and they need to be sustained over a period of time. In his \"Preface to Shakespeare\" (1765) Samuel Johnson said that a century is \"the term com\u00ad monly fixed as a test of literary merit.\" It seems, however, that some authors who wrote within the present century such as Marcel Proust, Franz Kafka, Thomas Mann, and James Joyce\u2014perhaps even a writer so recent as Vladimir Nabokov\u2014already have achieved the prestige, influence, assignment in col\u00ad lege courses, and persistence of reference in literary discourse to establish them in the European canon; others, including Yeats, T. S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf, and Robert Frost, seem already secure in their national canons, at least. At any time, the boundaries of a literary canon remain indefinite, while inside those boundaries some authors are central and others more marginal. Occasionally an earlier author who was for long on the fringe of the canon, or even outside it, gets transferred to a position of eminence. A conspicuous ex\u00ad ample was John Donne, who from the eighteenth century on was regarded mainly as an interestingly eccentric poet. T. S. Eliot, followed by Cleanth Brooks and other New Critics in the 1930s and later, made Donne's writings the very paradigm of the self-ironic and paradoxical poetry they most ad\u00ad mired, and so helped elevate him to a high place within the English canon. 30 CANON OF LITERATURE (See metaphysical poets.) Since then, Donne's towering reputation has dimin\u00ad ished, but he remains prominent in the canon. Once firmly established, an author shows considerable resistance to being disestablished by adverse criti\u00ad cism and changing literary preferences. For example many New Critics, to\u00ad gether with the influential E R. Leavis in England, while lauding Donne, vigorously attacked the Romantic poet Shelley as embodying poetic qualities they strongly condemned; but although a considerable number of critics joined in this derogation of Shelley, the long-term effect was to aggrandize the critical attention and discussion, whether in praise or dispraise, that helps sustain an author's place in the canon. Since the 1970s, the nature of canon formation, and opposition to estab\u00ad lished literary canons, have become a leading concern among critics of di\u00ad verse viewpoints, whether deconstructive, feminist, Marxist, postcolonial, or new historicist (see poststructuralism). The debate often focuses on the practi\u00ad cal issue of what books to assign in college curricula, especially in required \"core courses\" in the humanities and in Western civilization. A widespread charge is that the standard canon of great books, not only in literature but in all areas of humanistic study, has been determined less by artistic excellence than by the politics of power; that is, that the canon has been formed in ac\u00ad cordance with the ideology, political interests, and values of an \u00e9lite class that was white, male, and European. As a result, it is claimed that the canon con\u00ad sists mainly of works that convey and sustain racism, patriarchy, and imperial\u00ad ism, and serves to marginalize or exclude the interests and accomplishments of blacks, Hispanics, and other ethnic minorities, and also the achievements of women, the working class, popular culture, homosexuals, and non-European civilizations. The demand is \"to open the canon\" so as to make it multicul\u00ad tural instead of \"Eurocentric\" and to make it represent adequately the con\u00ad cerns and writings of women and of ethnic, non-heterosexual, and other groups. Another demand is that the standard canon be stripped of its elitism and its \"hierarchism\"\u2014that is, its built-in discriminations between high art and lower art\u2014in order to include such cultural products as Hollywood films, television serials, popular songs, and fiction written for a mass audience. There is also a radical wing of revisionist theorists who, to further the political aim to transform the existing power-structures, demand not merely the open\u00ad ing, but the abolition of the standard canon and its replacement by marginal and excluded groups and texts. The views of defenders of the standard canon, like those of its opponents, range from moderate to extreme. The position of many moderate defenders might be summarized as follows. Whatever has been the influence of class, gender, race, and other special interests in forming the existing canon, this is far from the whole story. The canon is the result of the concurrence of a great many (often unexpressed) norms and standards, and among these, one crucial factor has been the high intellectual and artistic quality of the canonical works themselves, and their attested power to give delight, and to appeal to widely shared human concerns and values. Moderate defenders agree to the desirabil\u00ad ity of enlarging the canon of texts that are assigned frequently in academic CARPE DIEM 31 courses, in order to make the canon more broadly representative of diverse cul\u00ad tures, ethnic groups, classes, and interests; they point out, however, that such changes would not be a drastic innovation, since the educational canon has al\u00ad ways been subject to deletions and additions. They emphasize that the existing Western, English, and American canons include exemplars of skepticism about established ways of thinking, of political radicalism, and of the toleration of dissent\u2014features of the accepted canons of which the present radical theorists and proponents of change are, clearly, the inheritors and beneficiaries. And however a canon is enlarged to represent other cultures and classes, moderate defenders insist on the need to maintain a continuing scrutiny of and dialogue with the diverse and long-lasting works of intellect and imagination that have shaped Western civilization and constitute much of Western culture. They point to the enduring primacy, over many centuries, of such Western authors as Homer, Shakespeare, and Dante. They also remark that many theorists who challenge the traditional English canon, when they turn from theory to ap\u00ad plied criticism, attend preponderantly to established major authors\u2014not only Shakespeare, but also Spenser, Milton, Jane Austen, Wordsworth, George Eliot, Whitman, Henry James and many others\u2014and so recognize and confirm in practice the literary canon that they in theory oppose. Discussions of the nature and formation of the literary canon: the collec\u00ad tion of essays edited by Robert von Hallberg, Canons (1984); John Guillory, Cultural Capital: The Problem of Canon Formation (1993); and Wendell V. Harris, oppo\u00ad nents of the traditional canon: Leslie A. Fiedler and Houston A.

Gless and Barbara H. Smith, eds., The Politics of Liberal Education (1990).

Carpe Diem, meaning \"seize the day,\" is a Latin phrase from one of Horace's Odes (I. xi.) which has become the name for a very common literary motif, es\u00ad pecially in lyric poetry. The speaker in a carpe diem poem emphasizes that life is short and time is fleeting in order to urge his auditor\u2014who is often repre\u00ad sented as a virgin reluctant to change her condition\u2014to make the most of present pleasures. A frequent emblem of the brevity of physical beauty and the finality of death is the rose, as in Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, 1590-96 (II. xii. 74-75; \"Gather therefore yet is prime\"), and, in the sev\u00ad enteenth century, Robert Herrick's \"To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time\" (\"Gather ye rosebuds, while ye may\"), and Edmund Waller's \"Go, Lovely Rose.\" The more complex poems of this type communicate the poignant sad\u00ad ness\u2014or else desperation\u2014of the pursuit of pleasures under the sentence of in\u00ad evitable death; for example, Andrew Marvell's \"To His Coy Mistress\" (1681) 32 CELTIC REVIVAL \u00b7 CHARACTER AND CHARACTERIZATION and the set of variations on the carpe diem motif in The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayyam, by the Victorian poet Edward FitzGerald. In 1747, Lady Mary Wort- ley Montagu wrote \"The Lover: A Ballad,\" a brilliant counter to the carpe diem poems written by male poets, in which the woman explains to her importu\u00ad nate lover why she finds him utterly resistible. Celtic Revival, also known as the Irish Literary Renaissance, identifies the remarkably creative period in Irish literature from about 1880 to the death of William Butler Yeats in 1939. The aim of Yeats and other early leaders of the movement was to create a distinctively national literature by going back to Irish history, legend, and folklore, as well as to native literary models. The major writers, however, wrote not in the native Irish (one of the Celtic lan\u00ad guages) but in English, and under the influence of various non-Irish literary forms; a number of them also turned increasingly for their subject matter to modern Irish life rather than to the ancient past. Notable poets in addition to Yeats were AE (George Russell) and Oliver St. John Gogarty. The dramatists included Yeats himself, as well as Lady Gregory (who was also an important patron and publicist for the movement), John Millington Synge, and later Sean O'Casey. Among the novelists were George Moore and James Stephens, as well as James Joyce, who, although he aban\u00ad doned Ireland for Europe and ridiculed the excesses of the nationalist writers, adverted to Irish subject matter and characters in all his writings. As these names indicate, the Celtic Revival produced some of the greatest poetry, drama, and prose fiction written in English during the first four decades of the twentieth century. See E. A. Boyd, Ireland's Literary Renaissance (1916; rev., 1922); Herbert Howarth, The Irish Writers (1958); Phillip L. Marcus, Yeats and the Beginning of the Irish Renaissance (1970), and \"The Celtic Revival: Literature and the Theater,\" in The Irish World: The History and Cultural Achievements of the Irish People (1977). Character and Characterization. (1) The character is the name of a literary genre; it is a short, and usually witty, sketch in prose of a distinctive type of person. The genre was inaugurated by Theophrastus, a Greek author of the second century B.C., who wrote a lively book entitled Characters. The form had a great vogue in the earlier seventeenth century; the books of characters then written by Joseph Hall, Sir Thomas Overbury, and John Earle influ\u00ad enced later writers of essays, history, and fiction. The titles of some of Overbury's sketches will indicate the nature of the form: \"A Courtier,\" \"A Wise Alding\u00ad ton's anthology A Book of \"Characters\" (1924). (2) Characters are the persons represented in a dramatic or narrative work, who are interpreted by the reader as being endowed with particular moral, intellectual, and emotional qualities by inferences from what the persons say and their distinctive ways of saying it\u2014the dialogue\u2014 CHARACTER AND CHARACTERIZATION 33 and from what they do\u2014the action. The grounds in the characters' temperament, desires, and moral nature for their speech and actions are called their motivation. A character may remain essentially \"sta\u00ad ble,\" or unchanged in outlook and disposition, from beginning to end of a work (Prospero in Shakespeare's The Tempest, Micawber in Charles Dickens' David Copperfield, 1849-50), or may undergo a radical change, either through a gradual process of development (the title character in Jane Austen's Emma, 1816) or as the result of a crisis (Shakespeare's King Lear, Pip in Dickens' Great Expectations). Whether a character remains stable or changes, the reader of a traditional and realistic work expects \"consistency\"\u2014the character should not suddenly break off and act in a way not plausibly grounded in his or her temperament as we have al\u00ad ready come to know it. E. M. Forster, in Aspects of the Novel (1927), introduced popular new terms for an old distinction by discriminating between flat and round characters. A flat character (also called a type, or \"two-dimensional\"), Forster says, is built around \"a single idea or quality\" and is presented without much individualiz\u00ad ing detail, and therefore can be fairly adequately described in a single phrase or sentence. A round character is complex in temperament and motivation and is represented with subtle particularity; such a character therefore is as difficult to describe with any adequacy as a person in real life, and like real persons, is capable of surprising us. A humours character, such as Ben Jonson's \"Sir Epicure Mammon,\" has a name which says it all, in contrast to the round\u00ad ness of character in Shakespeare's multifaceted Falstaff. Almost all dramas and narratives, properly enough, have some characters who serve merely as func\u00ad tionaries and are not characterized at all, as well as other characters who are left relatively flat: there is no need, in Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part I, for Mis\u00ad tress Quickly to be as globular as Falstaff. The degree to which, in order to be regarded as artistically successful, characters need to be three-dimensional de\u00ad pends on their function in the plot; in many types of narrative, such as in the detective story or adventure novel or farce comedy, even the protagonist is usually two-dimensional. Sherlock Holmes and Long John Silver do not re\u00ad quire, for their excellent literary roles, the roundness of a Hamlet, a Becky Sharp, or a Jay Gatsby. In his Anatomy of Criticism (1957), Northrop Frye has proposed that even lifelike characters are identifiable variants, more or less in\u00ad dividualized, of stock types in old literary genres, such as the self-deprecating \"eiron,\" the boastful \"alazon,\" and the \"senex iratus,\" or choleric old father in classical comedy. (See stock characters.) A broad distinction is frequently made between alternative methods for characterizing (i.e., establishing the distinctive characters of) the persons in a narrative: showing and telling. In showing (also called \"the dramatic method\"), the author simply presents the characters talking and acting and leaves the reader to infer the motives and dispositions that lie behind what they say and do. The author may show not only external speech and actions, but also a character's inner thoughts, feelings, and responsiveness to events; 34 CHIVALRIC ROMANCE for a highly developed mode of such inner showing, see stream of conscious\u00ad ness. In telling, the author intervenes authoritatively in order to describe, and often to evaluate, the motives and dispositional qualities of the characters. For example, in the terse opening chapter of Pride and Prejudice (1813), Jane Austen first shows us Mr. and Mrs. Bennet as they talk to one another about the young man who has just rented Netherfield Park, then (in the quotation below) tells us about them, and so confirms and expands the inferences that the reader has begun to make from what has been shown. Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, re\u00ad serve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. Her mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. Especially since the novelistic theory and practice of Flaubert and Henry James, a critical tendency has been to consider \"telling\" a violation of artistry and to recommend only the technique of \"showing\" characters; authors, it is said, should totally efface themselves in order to write \"objectively,\" \"imper\u00ad sonally,\" or \"dramatically.\" Such judgments, however, privilege a modern artistic limitation suited to particular novelistic effects, and decry an alterna\u00ad tive method of characterization which a number of novelists have employed to produce masterpieces. (See point of view) Innovative writers in the present century\u2014including novelists from James Joyce to French writers of the new novel, and authors of the dramas and novels of the absurd and various experimental forms\u2014often present the per\u00ad sons in their works in ways which run counter to the earlier mode of rep\u00ad resenting lifelike characters who manifest a consistent substructure of individuality. Recent structuralist critics have undertaken to dissolve even the lifelike characters of traditional novels into a system of literary conventions and codes which are naturalized by the readers; that is, readers are said to pro\u00ad ject lifelikeness upon codified literary representations by assimilating them to their own prior stereotypes of individuals in real life. See structuralist criticism and text and writing (\u00e9criture), and refer to Jonathan Culler, Structuralist Poetics (1975), chapter 9, \"Poetics of the Novel.\" See plot and narrative and nanatology. On the traditional problems and methods of characterization, including discussions of showing and telling, see in addition to . . Forster (above), Percy Lubbock, The Craft of Fiction (1926); Wayne C. Booth, The Rhetoric of Fiction (1961), especially chapters 1-4: and W. J. Harvey, Character and the Novel (1965). On problems in determining dramatic character, see Bert O. States, The Pleasure of the Play (1994); and on the disappearance of traditional characterization in postmodern drama, Eli\u00ad nor Fuchs, The Death of Character (1996). Chivalric Romance (or medieval romance) is a type of narrative that developed in twelfth-century France, spread to the literatures of other coun\u00ad tries, and displaced the earlier epic and heroic forms. (\"Romance\" originally CHORUS 35 signified a work written in the French language, which evolved from a dialect of the Roman language, Latin.) Romances were at first written in verse, but later in prose as well. The romance is distinguished from the epic in that it does not represent a heroic age of tribal wars, but a courtly and chivalric age, often one of highly developed manners and civility. Its standard plot is that of a quest undertaken by a single knight in order to gain a lady's favor; fre\u00ad quently its central interest is courtly love, together with tournaments fought and dragons and monsters slain for the damsel's sake; it stresses the chivalric ideals of courage, loyalty, honor, mercifulness to an opponent, and elaborate manners; and it delights in wonders and marvels. Supernatural events in the epic had their causes in the will and actions of the gods; romance shifts the supernatural to this world, and makes much of the mysterious effect of magic, spells, and enchantments. The recurrent materials of medieval chivalric romances have been di\u00ad vided by scholars into four classes of subjects: (1) \"The Matter of Britain\" (that is, Celtic subject matter, especially stories centering on the court of King Arthur). (2) \"The Matter of Rome\" (the history and legends of classical antiq\u00ad uity, including the exploits of Alexander the Great and of the heroes of the Trojan War); Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde belongs to this class. (3) \"The Matter of France\" (Charlemagne and his knights). (4) \"The Matter of England\" (heroes such as King Horn and Guy of Warwick). The cycle of tales which developed around the pseudohistorical British King Arthur produced many of the finest romances, some of them (stories of Sir Perceval and the quest for the Holy Grail) with a religious instead of a purely secular content. Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, the great twelfth-century French poet, wrote Arthurian romances; German examples are Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival and Gott\u00ad fried von Strassburg's Tristan und Isolde, both written early in the thirteenth century. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, composed in fourteenth-century England, is a metrical romance (that is, a romance written in verse) about an Arthurian knight; and Thomas Malory's Morte d'Arthur (fifteenth century) is an English version in prose of the cycle of earlier metrical romances about Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table. See prose romance, Gothic romance, and romantic comedy. Refer to W. P. Ker, Epic and Romance (1897); L. A. Hibbard, Medieval Romance in England (rev., 1961); R. S. Loomis, The Development of Arthurian Romance (1963), and The Grail (1963); and the anthology Medieval Romances, ed. R. S. and L. H. Loomis (1957). For the history of the term \"romance\" and modern extensions of the genre of romance, see Gillian Beer, The Romance (1970); and for Northrop Frye's theory of the mythical basis of the romance genre, see the entry in this Glossary on myth. Chorus. Among the ancient Greeks the chorus was a group of people, wear\u00ad ing masks, who sang or chanted verses while performing dancelike maneu\u00ad vers at religious festivals. A similar chorus played a part in Greek tragedies, where (in the plays of Aeschylus and Sophocles) they served mainly as com\u00ad mentators on the dramatic actions and events who expressed traditional 36 CHRONICLE PLAYS moral, religious, and social attitudes; beginning with Euripides, however, the chorus assumed primarily a lyrical function. The Greek ode, as developed by Pindar, was also chanted by a chorus; see ode. Roman playwrights such as Seneca took over the chorus from the Greeks, and in the mid-sixteenth century some English dramatists (for example, Nor\u00ad ton and Sackville in Gorbuduc) imitated the Senecan chorus. The classical type of chorus was never widely adopted by English dramatic writers. John Milton, however, included a chorus in Samson Agonistes (1671), Shelley in Prometheus Unbound (1820), and Thomas Hardy in The Dynasts (1904-08); more recently, T. S. Eliot made effective use of the classical chorus in his religious tragedy Murder in the Cathedral (1935). The use of a chorus of singers and dancers sur\u00ad vives also in opera and in musical comedies. During the Elizabethan Age the term \"chorus\" was applied also to a sin\u00ad gle person who spoke the prologue and epilogue to a play, and sometimes in\u00ad troduced each act as well. This character served as the author's vehicle for commentary on the play, as well as for exposition of its subject, time, and set\u00ad ting, and the description of events happening offstage; see Christopher Mar\u00ad lowe's Dr. Faustus and Shakespeare's Henry V. In Shakespeare's Winter's Tale, the fifth act begins with \"Time, the Chorus'\" who asks the audience that they \"impute it not a crime / To me or my swift passage that I slide / O'er sixteen years\" since the preceding events, then summarizes what has happened dur\u00ad ing those years and announces that the setting for this present act is Bohemia. A modern and extended use of a single character with a choral function is the Stage Manager in Thornton Wilder's Our Town (1938). Modern scholars use the term choral character to refer to a person within the play itself who stands apart from the action and by his comments provides the audience with a special perspective (often an ironic perspective) through which to view the other characters and events. Examples in Shake\u00ad speare are the Fool in King Lear, Enobarbus in Antony and Cleopatra, and Ther- sites in Troilus and Cressida; a modern instance is Seth Beckwith in O'Neill's Mourning Becomes Electra (1931). \"Choral character\" is sometimes applied also to one or more persons in a novel who represent the point of view of a com\u00ad munity or of a cultural group, and so provide norms by which to judge the other characters and what they do; instances are Thomas Hardy's peasants and the old black women in some of William Faulkner's novels. For the alternative use of the term \"chorus\" to signify a recurrent stanza in a song, see refrain. Refer to A. W. Pickard-Cambridge, Dithyramb, Tragedy and Comedy (1927), and The Dramatic Festivals of Athens (1953); T. B. L. Web\u00ad ster, Greek Theater Production (1956). Chronicle Plays were dramatic works based on the historical materials in the English Chronicles by Raphael Holinshed and others. They achieved high popularity late in the sixteenth century, when the patriotic fervor following the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 fostered a demand for plays dealing with English history. The early chronicle plays presented a loosely knit series of events during the reign of an English king and depended for effect mainly CHRONICLES \u00b7 CLICHE 37 on a bustle of stage battles, pageantry, and spectacle. Christopher Marlowe, however, in his Edward II (1592) selected and rearranged materials from Holinshed's Chronicles to compose a unified drama of character, and Shake\u00ad speare's series of chronicle plays, encompassing the succession of English kings from Richard II to Henry VIII, includes such major artistic achievements as Richard II, 1 Henry IV, 2 Henry IV, and Henry V The Elizabethan chronicle plays are sometimes called history plays. This latter term, however, is often applied more broadly to any drama based mainly on historical materials, such as Shakespeare's Roman plays Julius Cae\u00ad sar and Antony and Cleopatra, and including such recent examples as Arthur Miller's The Crucible (1953), which treats the Salem witch trials of 1692, and Robert Bolt's A Man for All Seasons (1962), about the sixteenth-century judge, author, and martyr Sir Thomas More. E. M. Tillyard, Shakespeare's History Plays (1946); Lily B. Campbell, Shake\u00ad speare's \"Histories\" (1947); Irving Ribner, The English History Play in the Age of Shakespeare (rev., 1965); Max M. Reese, The Cease of Majesty: A Study of Shake\u00ad speare's History Plays (1962). For a recent new-historicist treatment of Shake\u00ad speare's Henry IV, 1 and 2 and Henry V, see Stephen Greenblatt, \"Invisible Bullets,\" in Political Shakespeare: New Essays in Cultural Materialism, ed. Jonathan Dollimore and Alan Sinfield (1985). Chronicles, the predecessors of modern histories, were written accounts, in prose or verse, of national or worldwide events over a considerable period of time. If the chronicles deal with events year by year, they are often called an\u00ad nals. Unlike the modern historian, most chroniclers tended to take their in\u00ad formation as they found it, making little attempt to separate fact from legend. The most important English chronicles are the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, started by King Alfred in the ninth century and continued until the twelfth century, and the Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland (1577-87) by Raphael Holinshed and other writers; the latter documents were important sources of materials for the chronicle plays of Shakespeare and other Elizabethan drama\u00ad tists. Clich\u00e9, which is French for the stereotype used in printing, signifies an ex\u00ad pression that deviates enough from ordinary usage to call attention to itself and has been used so often that it is felt to be hackneyed or cloying. \"I beg your pardon\" or \"sincerely yours\" are do \"lock, and barrel\" are accounted as clich\u00e9s; so are indiscriminate uses in ordinary talk of terms taken from specialized vocabu\u00ad laries such as \"alienation,\" \"identity crisis,\" and \"interface.\" Some clich\u00e9s are foreign phrases that are used as an arch or elegant equivalent for a common English term (\"aqua pura,\" \"terra firma\"); others are over-used literary echoes. \"The cup that cheers\" is an inaccurate quotation from William Cowper's The Task (1785), referring to tea\u2014\"the cups / That cheer but not inebriate.\" In his Essay on Criticism (II. 11. 350 ff.) Alexander Pope comments satirically on 38 COMEDY some clich\u00e9s that early eighteenth-century poetasters (untalented pretenders to the poetic art) used in order to eke out their rhymes: Where'er you find \"the cooling western breeze,\" In the next line, it \"whispers through the trees\"; If crystal streams \"with pleasing murmurs creep,\" The reader's threatened (not in vain) with \"sleep.\" See Eric Partridge, A Dictionary of Clich\u00e9s (4th ed., 1950), and Christine Ammer, Have a Nice Day\u2014No Problem! A Dictionary of Clich\u00e9s (1992). Comedy. In the most common literary application, a comedy is a fictional work in which the materials are selected and managed primarily in order to interest and amuse us: the characters and their discomfitures engage our pleasurable attention rather than our profound concern, we are made to feel confident that no great disaster will occur, and usually the action turns out happily for the chief characters. The term \"comedy\" is customarily applied only to plays for the stage or to motion pictures; it should be noted, how\u00ad ever, that the comic form, so defined, also occurs in prose fiction and narra\u00ad tive poetry. Within the very broad spectrum of dramatic comedy, the following types are frequently distinguished: (1) Romantic comedy was developed by Elizabethan dramatists on the model of contemporary prose romances such as Thomas Lodge's Ros- alynde (1590), the source of Shakespeare's As You Like It (1599). Such comedy represents a love affair that involves a beautiful and engaging heroine (sometimes disguised as a man); the course of this love does not run smooth, yet overcomes all difficulties to end in a happy union (refer to E. C. Pettet, Shakespeare and the Romance Tradition, 1949). Many of the boy-meets-girl plots of later writers are instances of romantic comedy, as are many motion pictures from The Philadel\u00ad phia Story to Sleepless in Seattle. In The Anatomy of Criticism (1957), Northrop Frye points out that some of Shakespeare's romantic come\u00ad dies manifest a movement from the normal world of conflict and trouble into \"the green world\"\u2014the Forest of Arden in As You Like It, or the fairy-haunted wood of A Midsummer Night's Dream\u2014in which the problems and injustices of the ordinary world are dissolved, ene\u00ad mies reconciled, and true lovers united. Frye regards that phenome\u00ad non (together with other aspects of these comedies, such as their festive conclusion in the social ritual of a wedding, a feast, a dance) as evidence that comic plots derive from primitive myths and rituals that celebrated the victory of spring over winter. (See archetypal criti\u00ad cism.) Linda Bamber's Comic Women, Tragic Men: A Study of Gender and Genre in Shakespeare (1982) undertakes to account for the fact that in Shakespeare's romantic comedies, the women are often superior to the men, while in his tragedies he \"creates such nightmare female fig\u00ad ures as Goneril, Regan, Lady Macbeth, and Volumnia.\" COMEDY (2) Satiric comedy ridicules political policies or philosophical doctrines, or else attacks deviations from the social order by making ridiculous the violators of its standards of morals or manners. (See satire.) The early master of satiric comedy was the Greek Aristophanes, c. 450- c. 385 B.C., whose plays mocked political, philosophical, and literary matters of his age. Shakespeare's contemporary, Ben Jonson, wrote satiric or (as it is sometimes called) \"corrective comedy.\" In his Volpone and The Alchemist, for example, the greed and ingenuity of one or more intelligent but rascally swindlers, and the equal greed but stupid gullibility of their victims, are made grotesquely or repul\u00ad sively ludicrous rather than lightly amusing. (3) The comedy of manners originated in the New Comedy of the Greek Menander, c. 342-292 B.C. (as distinguished from the Old Comedy represented by Aristophanes) and was developed by the Roman dramatists Plautus and Terence in the third and second cen\u00ad turies B.C. Their plays dealt with the vicissitudes of young lovers and included what became the stock characters of much later comedy, such as the clever servant, old and stodgy parents, and the wealthy rival. The English comedy of manners was early exemplified by Shake\u00ad speare's Love's Labour's Lost and Much Ado about Nothing, and was given a high polish in Restoration comedy (1660-1700). The Restoration form owes much to the brilliant dramas of the French writer Moli\u00e8re, 1622-73. It deals with the relations and intrigues of men and women living in a sophisticated upper-class society, and relies for comic effect in large part on the wit and sparkle of the dia\u00ad logue\u2014often in the form of repartee, a witty conversational give-and- take which constitutes a kind of verbal fencing match\u2014and to a lesser degree, on the violations of social standards and decorum by would- be wits, jealous husbands, conniving rivals, and foppish dandies. Ex\u00ad cellent examples are William Congreve's The Way of the World and William Wycherley's The Country Wife. A middle-class reaction against what had come to be considered the immorality of situation and indecency of dialogue in the courtly Restoration comedy resulted in the sentimental comedy of the eighteenth century. In the latter part of the century, however, Oliver Goldsmith {She Stoops to Conquer) and his contemporary Richard Brinsley Sheridan (The Rivals and A School for Scandal) revived the wit and gaiety, while deleting the indecency, of Restoration comedy. The comedy of manners lapsed in the early nineteenth century, but was revived by many skillful dramatists, from A. W. Pinero and Oscar Wilde (The Importance of Being Earnest, 1895), through George Bernard Shaw and Noel Coward, to Neil Simon, Alan Ayckbourn, Wendy Wasserstein, and other writers of the present era. Many of these comedies have also been adapted for the cinema. See David L. Hirst, Comedy of Manners (1979). (4) Farce is a type of comedy designed to provoke the audience to sim\u00ad ple, hearty laughter\u2014\"belly laughs,\" in the parlance of the theater. To 40 COMEDY do so it commonly employs highly exaggerated or caricatured types of characters, puts them into improbable and ludicrous situations, and makes free use of sexual mix-ups, broad verbal humor, and phys\u00ad ical bustle and horseplay. Farce was a component in the comic episodes in medieval miracle plays, such as the Wakefield plays Noah and the Second Shepherd's Play, and constituted the matter of the Ital\u00ad ian commedia dell'arte in the Renaissance. In the English drama that has stood the test of time, farce is usually an episode in a more com\u00ad plex form of comedy\u2014examples are the knockabout scenes in Shake\u00ad speare's The Taming of the Shrew and The Merry Wives of Windsor. The plays of the French playwright Georges Feydeau (1862-1921), em\u00ad ploying sexual humor and innuendo, are true farce throughout, as is Brandon Thomas' Charley's Aunt, an American play of 1892 which has often been revived, and also some of the current plays of Tom Stoppard. Many of the movies by such comedians as Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, W. C. Fields, the Marx brothers, and Woody Allen are excellent farce, as are the Monty Python films and television episodes. Farce is often employed in single scenes of musical revues, and is the standard fare of television \"situation comedies.\" It should be noted that the term \"farce,\" or sometimes \"farce comedy,\" is ap\u00ad plied also supreme example Oscar Wilde's The Impor\u00ad tance of Being Earnest (1895)\u2014in which exaggerated character-types find themselves in ludicrous situations in the course of an improba\u00ad ble plot, but which achieve their comic effects not by broad humor and bustling action, but by the sustained brilliance and wit of the di\u00ad alogue. Farce is also a frequent comic tactic in the theater of the ab\u00ad surd. Refer to Robert Metcalf Smith and H. G. Rhoads, eds., Types of Farce Comedy, 1928; Leo Hughes, A Century of English Farce (1956); and for the history of farce and low comedy from the Greeks to the pres\u00ad ent, Anthony Caputi, Buffo: The Genius of Vulgar Comedy (1978). A distinction is often made between high and low comedy. High comedy, as described by George Meredith in the classic essay The Idea of Comedy (1877), evokes \"intellectual laughter\"\u2014thoughtful laughter from spectators who re\u00ad main emotionally detached from the action\u2014at the spectacle of folly, preten\u00ad tiousness, and incongruity in human behavior. Meredith finds its highest form within the comedy of manners, in the combats of wit (sometimes identified now as the \"love duels\") between such intelligent, highly verbal, and well- matched lovers as Benedick and Beatrice in Shakespeare's Much Ado about Noth\u00ad ing (1598-99) and Mirabell and Millamant in Congreve's The Way of the World (1700). Low comedy, at the other extreme, has little or no intellectual appeal, but undertakes to arouse laughter by jokes, or \"gags,\" and by slapstick humor and boisterous or clownish physical activity; it is, therefore, one of the com\u00ad mon components of farce.

Comedy of Humours. A type of comedy developed by Ben Jonson, the Elizabethan playwright, based on the ancient physiological theory of the \"four humours\" that was still current in Jonson's time. The humours were held to be the four primary fluids\u2014blood, phlegm, choler (or yellow bile), and melancholy (or black bile)\u2014whose \"temperament\" or mixture, was held to determine both a person's physical condition and character type. An im\u00ad balance of one or another humour in a temperament was said to produce four kinds of disposition, whose names have survived the underlying theory: san\u00ad guine (from the cholic. In Jonson's comedy of humours each of the major characters has a preponderant humour that gives him a characteristic distortion or eccentric\u00ad ity of disposition. Jonson expounds his theory in the \"Induction\" to his play Every Man in His Humour (1598) and exemplifies the mode in his later come\u00ad dies; often he identifies the ruling disposition of a humours character by his or character appears in plays by other Elizabethans, and remained influential in the comedies of manners by William Wycherley, Sir George Etheredge, William Congreve, and other dramatists of the English Restoration, 1660-1700. Comic Relief is the introduction of comic characters, speeches, or scenes in a serious or tragic work, especially in dramas. Such elements were almost uni\u00ad versal in Elizabethan tragedy. Sometimes they occur merely as episodes of dia\u00ad logue or horseplay for purposes of alleviating tension and adding variety; in more carefully wrought plays, however, they are also integrated with the plot, in a way that counterpoints and enhances the serious or tragic significance. Examples of such complex uses of comic elements are the gravediggers in Hamlet (V. L), the scene of the drunken porter after the murder of the king in Macbeth (II. iii.), the Falstaff scenes in 1 Henry IV, and the roles of Mercurio and the old nurse in Romeo and Juliet. See Thomas De Quincey's classic essay \"On the Knocking at the Gate in Macbeth\" (1823). Commedia dell'Arte was a form of comic drama developed about the mid- sixteenth century by guilds of professional Italian actors. Playing stock charac\u00ad ters, the actors largely improvised the dialogue around a given scenario\u2014a term that still denotes a brief outline of a drama, indicating merely the entrances of 42 CONCEIT the main characters and the general course of the action. In a typical play, a pair of young lovers outwit a rich old father (\"Pantaloon\"), aided by a clever and in\u00ad triguing servant (\"Harlequin\"), in a plot enlivened by the buffoonery of \"Punch\" and other clowns. Wandering Italian troupes played in all the large cities of Renaissance Europe and influenced various writers of comedies in Eliz\u00ad abethan England and, later, Moli\u00e8re in France. The modern puppet shows of Punch and Judy are descendants of this old Italian comedy, emphasizing its components of farce and buffoonery. See Kathleen M. Lea, Italian Popular Comedy, 1560-1620 (2 vols.; 1934). Conceit. Originally meaning a concept or image, \"conceit\" came to be the term for figures of speech which establish a striking parallel, usually ingen\u00ad iously elaborate, between two very dissimilar things or situations. (See figura\u00ad tive language.) English poets of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries adapted the term from the Italian \"concetto.\" Two types of conceit are often distinguished by specific names: (1 ) The Petrarchan conceit is a type of figure used in love poems that had been novel and effective in the Italian poet Petrarch, but became hackneyed in some of his imitators among the Elizabethan son\u00ad neteers. The figure consists of detailed, ingenious, and often exagger\u00ad ated comparisons applied to the disdainful mistress, as cold and cruel as she is beautiful, and to the distresses and despair of her worshipful lover. (See courtly love.) Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503-42), for example, in the sonnet \"My Galley Charged with Forgetfulness\" that he trans\u00ad lated from Petrarch, compares the lover's state in detail to a ship la\u00ad boring in a storm. Another sonnet of Petrarch's translated by Wyatt begins with an oxymoron describing the opposing passions experi\u00ad enced by a courtly sufferer from the disease of love: I find no peace; and all my war is done; I fear and hope; I burn and freeze in ice. Shakespeare (who at times employed this type of conceit himself) parodied some standard comparisons by Petrarchan sonneteers in his Sonnet 130, beginning My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun; Coral is far more red than her lips' red: If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun; If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head. (2) The metaphysical conceit is a characteristic figure in John Donne (1572-1631) and other metaphysical poets of the seventeenth century. It was described by Samuel Johnson, in a famed passage in his \"Life of Cowley,\" (1779-81), as \"wit\" which is a kind of discordia Concors; a combination of dissimilar images, or discov\u00ad ery of occult resemblances in things apparently unlike.... The most heterogeneous ideas are yoked by violence together. CONCRETE AND ABSTRACT 43 The metaphysical poets exploited all knowledge\u2014commonplace or esoteric, practical, theological, or philosophical, true or fabulous\u2014for the vehicles of these figures; and their comparisons, whether succinct or expanded, were often novel and witty, and at their best startlingly effective. In sharp contrast to both the concepts and figures of con\u00ad ventional Petrarchism is John Donne's \"The Flea,\" a poem that uses a flea who has bitten both lovers as the basic reference for its argument against the lady's resistance to an importunate male. In Donne's \"The Canonization,\" as the poetic argument develops, the comparisons for the relationship between lovers move from the area of commerce and business, through actual and mythical birds and diverse forms of his\u00ad torical memorials, to a climax which equates the sexual acts and the moral status of worldly lovers with the ascetic life and heavenly desti\u00ad nation of unworldly saints. The most famous sustained conceit is Donne's parallel (in \"A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning\") between the continuing relationship of his and his lady's soul during their physical parting, and the coordinated movements of the two feet of a draftsman's compass. An oft-cited instance of the chilly ingenuity of the metaphysical conceit when it is overdriven is Richard Crashaw's description, in his mid-seventeenth-century poem \"Saint Mary Mag\u00ad dalene,\" of the tearful eyes of the repentant Magdalene as two faithful fountains Two walking baths, two weeping motions, Portable and compendious oceans. The metaphysical conceit fell out of favor in the eighteenth century, when it came to be regarded as strained and unnatural. But with the great re\u00ad vival of interest in the metaphysical poets during the early decades of the twentieth century, a number of modern poets exploited this type of figure. Examples are T. S. Eliot's comparison of the evening to \"a patient etherized upon a table\" at the beginning of \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,\" and the series of startling figurative vehicles in Dylan Thomas' \"In Memory of Ann Jones.\" The vogue for such conceits extended even to popular love songs, in the 1920s and later, by well-educated composers such as Cole Porter: \"You're the Cream in My Coffee\" and \"You're the Top.\" Refer to Rosemond Tuve, Elizabethan and Metaphysical Imagery (1947), and K. K. Ruthven, The Conceit (1969). Concrete and Abstract. In standard philosophical usage a \"concrete term\" is a word that denotes a particular person or physical object, and an \"abstract term\" denotes either a class of things or else (as in \"brightness,\" \"beauty,\" \"evil,\" \"despair\") qualities that exist only as attributes of particular persons or things. A sentence, accordingly, is said to be concrete if it makes an assertion about a particular subject (T. S. Eliot's \"Grishkin is nice .. .\"), and abstract if it makes an assertion about an abstract subject (Alexander Pope's \"Hope springs eternal in the human breast\"). Critics of literature, however, often use these 44 CONCRETE POETRY terms in an extended way: a passage is called abstract if it represents its sub\u00ad ject matter in general or nonsensuous words or with only a thin realization of its experienced qualities; it is called concrete if it represents its subject matter with striking particularity and sensuous detail. In his \"Ode and budded is a concrete description of a locale which interinvolves qualities that are per\u00ad ceived by four different senses: hearing, touch, sight, and smell. And in the opening of his 'Ode to a Nightingale,\" Keats communicates concretely, by a combination of literal and figurative language, how it feels, in physical detail, to experience the full-throated song of the nightingale: My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk, Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains ... It is frequently asserted that \"poetry is concrete,\" or, as John Crowe Ransom put it in The World's Body (1938), that its proper subject is \"the rich, contin\u00ad gent materiality of things.\" Most poetry is certainly more concrete than other modes of language, especially in its use of imagery. It should be kept in mind, however, that poets do not hesitate to use abstract language when the area of reference or artistic purpose calls for it. Keats, though he was one of the most concrete of poets, began Endymion with a sentence composed of abstract terms: A thing of beauty is a joy forever: Its loveliness increases; it will never Pass into nothingness; ... And some of the most moving and memorable passages in poetry are not concrete; for example, the statement about God in Dante's Paradiso, \"In His will is our peace,\" or the bleak comment by Edgar in the last act of King Lear, Men must endure Their going hence, even as their coming hither; Ripeness is all. See John Crowe Ransom, The World's Body (1938); Richard H. Fogle, Im\u00ad agery of Keats and Shelley (1949), chapter 5. Concrete Poetry is a recent term for an ancient poetic type, called pattern poems, that experiment with the visual shape in which a text is presented on the page. Some Greek poets, beginning in the third century B.C., shaped a text in the form of the object that the poem describes or suggests. In the Renais\u00ad sance and seventeenth century, a number of poets composed such patterned forms, in which the lines vary in length in such a way that their printed shape outlines the subject of the poem; familiar examples in English are George Her\u00ad bert's \"Easter and include St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9's Un Dice,\" 1897) and Guillaume Apollinaire's Calligrammes (1918); in the printed the poem \"Il pleut\" (\"It rains\") so that the component letters trickle down the page. The recent vogue of concrete poetry is a worldwide movement that was largely inaugurated in 1953 by the Swiss poet Eugen Gomringer. The practice of such poetry varies widely, but the common feature is the use of a radically reduced language, typed or printed in such a way as to force the visible text on the reader's attention as a physical object and not simply as a transparent carrier of its meanings. Many concrete poems, in fact, cannot be read at all in the conventional way, since they consist of a single word or phrase which is subjected to systematic alterations in the order and position of the compo\u00ad nent letters, or else are composed of fragments of words, or of nonsense sylla\u00ad bles, or even of single letters, numbers, and marks of punctuation. In their shaped patterns, concrete poets often use a variety of type fonts and sizes and different colors of type, and sometimes supplement the text with drawings or photographs, while some of their shapes, called \"kinetic,\" evolve as we turn the pages. America had its native tradition of pattern poetry in the typographical experiments of Ezra Pound, and especially e. e. cummings; see, for example, cummings' \"r-p-o-p-h-e-s-s-a-g-r\" in which, to represent the way we at first perceive vaguely, then identify, the leaping insect, scrambled sequences of let\u00ad ters gradually order themselves into the word \"grasshopper.\" Prominent re\u00ad cent practitioners of pattern poems in the shape of the things that they describe or meditate upon are Mary Swenson (Iconographie, 1970) and John Hollander (Types of Shape, 1991). Other Americans who have been influenced by the international vogue for concrete poetry include Emmett Williams, Jonathan Williams, and Mary Ellen Solt. Collections of concrete poems in a variety of languages are Emmett Williams, ed., An Anthology ofConaete Poetry (1967); Mary Ellen Solt, ed. (with a useful historical introduction), Concrete Poetry: A World View (1968). For a noted early-eighteenth-century attack on pattern poems, see Addison's com\u00ad ments on \"false wit\" in the Spectator, Nos. 58 and 63. Confessional Poetry designates a type of narrative and lyric verse, given impetus by Robert Lowell's Life Studies (1959), which deals with the facts and intimate mental and physical experiences of the poet's own life. Confessional poetry was written in rebellion against the demand for impersonality by T. S. Eliot and the New Critics. It differs in its secular subject matter from religious confessions in the lineage of Augustine's Confessions (c. 400 A.D.). It differs also from poems of the Romantic Period representing the poet's own circum\u00ad stances, experiences, and feelings, such as William Wordsworth's \"Tintern Abbey\" and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"Dejection: An Ode,\" in the candor and sometimes shocking detail with which the poet reveals private or clinical matters about himself or herself, including sexual experiences, mental an\u00ad guish and illness, experiments with drugs, and suicidal impulses. Confes\u00ad sional poems were written by Allen Ginsberg, Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, John 46 CONFIDANT \u00b7 CONNOTATION AND DENOTATION Berryman, and other American poets. See Diane Middlebrook, Anne Sexton: A Biography (1991), and \"What Was Confessional Poetry?\" in The Columbia His\u00ad tory of American Poetry, ed. Jay Parini (1993). Confidant (the feminine form is \"confidante\") is a character in a drama or novel who plays only a minor role in the action, but serves the protagonist as a trusted friend to whom he or she confesses intimate thoughts, problems, and feelings. In drama the confidant provides the playwright with a plausible device for communicating to the audience the knowledge, state of mind, and intentions of a principal character without the use of stage devices such as the soliloquy or the aside; examples are Hamlet's friend Horatio in Shakespeare's Hamlet, and Cleopatra's maid Charmion in his Antony and Cleopatra. In prose fiction a famed confidant is Dr. Watson in Arthur Conan Doyle's stories about Sherlock Holmes (1887 and following). The device is particularly useful to those modern writers who, like Henry James, have largely renounced the novelist's earlier privileges of having access to a character's state of mind and of intruding into the narrative in order to address such information di\u00ad rectly to the reader. (See point of view.) James applied to the confidant the term ficelle, French for the string by which the puppeteer manages his puppets. Discussing Maria Gostrey, Strether's confidante in The Ambassadors, James re\u00ad marks that she is a \"ficelle\" who is not, \"in essence, Strether's friend. She is the reader's friend much rather\" (James, The Art of the Novel, ed. R. P. Black- mur, 1934, pp. 321-22). See W. J. Harvey, Character and the Novel (1966). Connotation and Denotation. In a widespread literary usage, the deno\u00ad tation of a word is its primary signification or reference; its connotation is the range of secondary or associated significations and feelings which it com\u00ad monly suggests or implies. Thus \"home\" denotes the house where one lives, but connotes privacy, intimacy, and coziness; that is the reason real estate agents like to use \"home\" instead of \"house\" in their advertisements. \"Horse\" and \"steed\" denote the same quadruped, but \"steed\" has a different connota\u00ad tion that derives from the chivalric or romantic narratives in which this word was often used. The connotation of a word is only a potential range of secondary signifi\u00ad cations; which part of these connotations are evoked depends on the way the word is used in a particular context. Poems typically establish contexts that bring into play some part of the connotative as well as the denotative mean\u00ad ing of words. In his poem \"Virtue\" George Herbert wrote, Sweet day, so cool, so calm, so bright, The bridal of the earth and sky. The denotation of \"bridal\"\u2014a union between human beings\u2014serves as part of the ground for applying the word as a metaphor to the union of earth and sky; but the specific poetic context in which the word occurs also evokes such connotations of \"bridal\" as sacred, joyous, and ceremonial. (Note that CONVENTIONS 47 \"marriage\" although metrically and denotatively equivalent to \"bridal,\" would have been less richly significant in this context, because more com\u00ad monplace in its connotation.) Even the way a word is spelled may alter its connotation. John Keats, in a passage of his \"Ode to a Nightingale\" (1819), Charmed magic casements, opening on the foam Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn, altered his original spelling of \"fairy\" to the old form \"faery\" in order to evoke the connotations of antiquity, as well as of the magic world of Spenser's The Faerie Queene. On connotation and denotation see Isabel C. Hungerland, Poetic Dis\u00ad course (1958), chapter 1, and Monroe C. Beardsley, Aesthetics: Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism (1958), chapter 3. Conventions. (1) In one sense of the term, conventions (derived from the Latin term for \"coming together\") are necessary, or at least convenient, devices, accepted by tacit agreement between author and audience, for solv\u00ad ing the problems in representing reality that are posed by a particular artistic medium. In watching a modern production of a Shake\u00ad spearean play, for example, the audience accepts without question the convention by which a proscenium stage with three walls (or if it is a theater in the round, with no walls) represents a room with four walls. It also accepts the convention of characters speaking in blank verse instead of prose, and uttering their private thoughts in soliloquies and asides, as well as the convention by which actions presented on a single stage in less than three hours may represent events which take place in a great variety of places, and over a span of many years. (2) In a second sense of the term, conventions are conspicuous features of subject matter, form, or technique that occur repeatedly in works of literature. Conventions in this sense may be recurrent types of character, turns of plot, forms of versification, or kinds of diction and style. Stock characters such as the Elizabethan braggart soldier, or the languishing and fainting heroine of Victorian fiction, or the sad young men of the lost-generation novels of the 1920s, were among the conventions of their literary eras. The abrupt reform of the villain at the end of the last act was a common convention of melodrama. Eu\u00ad phuism in prose, and the Petrarchan and metaphysical conceits in verse, were conventional devices of style. It is now just as much a literary convention to be outspoken on sexual matters as it was to be reticent in the age of Charles Dickens and George Eliot. (3) In the most inclusive sense, common in structuralist criticism, all lit\u00ad erary works, no matter how seemingly realistic, are held to be entirely constituted by literary conventions, or \"codes\"\u2014of genre, plot, char\u00ad acter, language, and so on\u2014which a reader naturalizes, by assimilat\u00ad ing these conventions to the world of discourse and experience that, 48 COURTLY LOVE in the reader's time and place, are regarded as real, or \"natural.\" (See structuralist criticism and character and characterization.) Invention was originally a term used in theories of rhetoric, and later in literary criticism, to signify the \"finding\" of the subject matter by an orator or a poet; it then came to signify innovative elements in a work, in contrast to the deliberate \"imitation\" of the forms and subjects of prior literary models. (See imitation.) At the present time, \"invention\" is often opposed to \"conven\u00ad tion\" (in sense 2, above) to signify the inauguration by a writer of an un\u00ad precedented subject or theme or form or style, and the resulting work is said to possess originality. Repeatedly in the history of literature, innovative writ\u00ad ers such as John Donne, Walt Whitman, James Joyce, or Virginia Woolf rebel against reigning conventions of their time to produce highly original works, only to have their inventions imitated by other writers, who thereby convert literary novelties into an additional set of literary conventions. There is nothing either good or bad in the extent or obviousness of con\u00ad formity to pre-existing conventions; all depends on the effectiveness of the use an individual writer makes of them. The pastoral elegy, for example, is one of the most conspicuously convention-bound of literary forms, yet in \"Lyci- das\" (1638) John Milton achieved what, by wide critical agreement, ranks as one of the greatest lyrics in the language. He did this by employing the an\u00ad cient pastoral rituals with freshness and power, so as to absorb an individual's death into the universal human experience, and to add to his voice the reso\u00ad nance of earlier pastoral laments for a poet who died young. See E. E. Stoll, Poets and Playwrights (1930); M. C. Bradbrook, Themes and Conventions of Elizabethan Tragedy (1935); Harry Levin, \"Notes on Conven\u00ad tion,\" in Perspectives of Criticism (1950); and the issues On Convention in New Literary History, vols. 13-14 (1981 and 1983). On convention and originality see John L. Lowes, Convention and Revolt in Poetry (1919); Graham Hough, Re\u00ad flections on a Literary Revolution (1960). Courtly Love. A doctrine of love, together with an elaborate code governing the relations between aristocratic lovers, which was widely represented in the lyric poems and chivalric romances of western Europe during the Middle Ages. The development of the conventions of courtly love is usually attributed to the troubadours (poets of Provence, in southern France) in the period from the latter eleventh century through the twelfth century. In the conventional doc\u00ad trine, love between the sexes, with its erotic and physical aspects spiritualized, is regarded as the noblest passion this side of heaven. The courtly lover ideal\u00ad izes and idolizes his beloved, and subjects himself to her every whim. (This love is often that of a bachelor knight for another man's wife, as in the stories of Tristan and Isolde or of Lancelot and Guinevere; it must be remembered that marriage among the upper classes in medieval Europe was usually not a relationship of love, but a kind of business contract, for economic and politi\u00ad cal purposes.) The lover suffers agonies of body and spirit as he is put to the test by his imperious sweetheart, but remains devoted to her, manifesting his CRITICISM 49 honor by his unswerving fidelity and his adherence to a rigorous code of be\u00ad havior, both in knightly battles and in the complex ceremonies of courtly speech and conduct. The origins and development of courtly love have been traced to a num\u00ad ber of sources: a serious reading of the Roman poet Ovid's mock-serious book The Remedies of Love; an imitation in lovers' relations of the politics of feudal\u00ad ism (the lover is a vassal, and both his lady and the god of love are his lords); and especially an importation into amatory situations of Christian concepts and ritual and the veneration of the Virgin Mary. Thus, the lady is exalted and worshiped; the lover sins and repents; and if his faith stays steadfast, he may be admitted at last into the lover's heaven through his lady's \"gift of grace.\" From southern France the doctrines of courtly love spread to Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes (flourished 1170-90) and other poets and romance writers in northern France, to Dante {La Vita Nuova, 1290-94), Petrarch, and other writers in fourteenth-century Italy, and to the love poets of Germany and northern Europe. For the reader of English literature the conventions of courtly love are best known by their occurrence in the medieval romance Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, in Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, and later in the Petrarchan subject matter and the Petrarchan conceits of the Elizabethan sonneteers. There has long been a debate whether medieval courtly love was limited to literature and to elegant conversation at courts, or whether to some degree it reflected the actual sentiments and conduct of aristocratic life of the time. What is clear is that its views of the intensity and the ennobling power of love as \"the grand passion,\" of the special sensibility and spiritual status of women, and of the complex decorum governing relations between the sexes have profoundly affected not only the literature of love but also the actual experience of \"being in love\" in the Western world, through the nine\u00ad teenth century and (to a diminished extent) even into our own day of sexual candor, freedom, and the feminist movement for equivalence in the rela\u00ad tions between the sexes. A number of feminists attack the medieval doctrine of courtly love, and later tendencies to spiritualize and idealize women, as in fact demeaning to them, and a covert device to ensure their social, political, and economic subordination to men. See feminist criticism. C. S. Lewis, The Allegory of Love (1936); A. J. Denomy, The Heresy of Courtly Love (1947); M. J. Valency, In Praise of Love (1958); F. X.

Howard Bloch, Medieval Misogyny and the Invention of Western Romantic Love (1991). Criticism, or more specifically literary criticism, is the overall term for studies concerned with defining, classifying, analyzing, interpreting, and 50 CRITICISM evaluating works of literature. Theoretical criticism proposes an explicit the\u00ad ory of literature, in the sense of general principles, together with a set of terms, distinctions, and categories, to be applied to identifying and analyzing works of literature, as well as the criteria (the standards, or norms) by which these works and their writers are to be evaluated. The earliest, and enduringly important, treatise of theoretical criticism was Aristotle's Poetics (fourth cen\u00ad tury B.C.). Among the most influential theoretical critics in the following cen\u00ad turies were Longinus Samuel Johnson, Coleridge, and Matthew Arnold in England; and Poe and Emerson in America. Land\u00ad marks of theoretical criticism in the first half of the twentieth century are I. A. Richards, Principles of Literary Criticism (1924); Kenneth Burke, The Philosophy of Literary Form (1941, rev. 1957); Eric Auerbach, Mimesis (1946); R. S. Crane, ed., Critics and Criticism (1952); and Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism (1957). Since the 1970s there has been a large number of writings, Continental, American, and English, proposing diverse novel and radical forms of critical theory. These are listed and dated in the entry Theories of literature, current; each theory in that list is also given a separate entry in this Glossary. For a dis\u00ad cussion of the special uses of the term \"theory\" in these current critical move\u00ad ments, see poststructuralism. Practical criticism, or applied criticism, concerns itself with the discus\u00ad sion of particular works and writers; in an applied critique, the theoretical principles controlling the mode of the analysis, interpretation, and evalua\u00ad tion are often left implicit, or brought in only as the occasion demands. Among the more influential works of applied criticism in England and Amer\u00ad ica are the literary essays of Dryden in the Restoration; Dr. Johnson's Lives of the English Poets (1779-81); Coleridge's chapters on the poetry of Wordsworth in Biographia (1817) and his lectures on Shakespeare; William Haz- litt's lectures on Shakespeare and the English poets, in the second and third decades of the nineteenth century; Matthew Arnold's Essays in Criticism (1865 and following); I. A. Richards' Practical Criticism (1930); T. S. Eliot's Selected Es\u00ad says (1932); and the many critical essays by Virginia Woolf, F. R. Leavis, and Lionel Trilling. Cleanth Brooks' The Well Wrought Urn (1947) exemplifies the \"close reading\" of single texts which was the typical mode of practical criti\u00ad cism in the American New Criticism. Practical criticism is sometimes distinguished into impressionistic and ju\u00ad dicial criticism: Impressionistic criticism attempts to represent in words the felt quali\u00ad ties of a particular passage or work, and to express the responses (the \"impres\u00ad sion\") that the work directly evokes from the critic. As William Hazlitt put it in his essay \"On Genius and Common Sense\" (1824): \"You decide from feel\u00ad ing, and not from reason; that is, from the impression of a number of things on the mind ... though you may not be able to analyze or account for it in the several particulars.\" And Walter Pater later said that in criticism \"the first step toward seeing one's object as it really is, is to know one's own impression CRITICISM 51 as it really is, to discriminate it, to realise it distinctly,\" and posed as the basic question, \"What is this song or picture ... to mei'' (preface to Studies in the History of the Renaissance, 1873). At its extreme this mode of criticism be\u00ad comes, in Anatole France's phrase, \"the adventures of a sensitive soul among masterpieces.\" Judicial criticism, on the other hand, attempts not merely to communi\u00ad cate, but to analyze and explain the effects of a work by reference to its sub\u00ad ject, organization, techniques, and style, and to base the critic's individual judgments on specified criteria of literary excellence. Rarely are these two modes of criticism sharply distinct in practice, but good examples of primar\u00ad ily impressionistic commentary can be found in the Greek Longinus (see the characterization of the Odyssey in his treatise On the Sublime), Hazlitt, Walter Pater (the locus classicus of impressionism is his description of Leonardo's Mona Lisa in The Renaissance, 1873), and some of the twentieth-century criti\u00ad cal essays of E. M. Forster and Virginia Woolf. Types of traditional critical theories and of applied criticism can be use\u00ad fully distinguished according to whether, in explaining and judging a work of literature, they refer the work primarily to the outer world, or to the reader, or to the author, or else treat the work as an entity in itself: (1 ) Mimetic criticism views the literary work as an imitation, or reflec\u00ad tion, or representation of the world and human life, and the primary criterion applied to a work is the \"truth\" of its representation to the subject matter that it represents, or should represent. This mode of criticism, which first appeared in Plato and (in a qualified way) in Aristotle, remains characteristic of modern theories of literary real\u00ad ism. (See imitation.) (2) Pragmatic criticism views the work as something which is con\u00ad structed in order to achieve certain effects on the audience (effects such as aesthetic pleasure, instruction, or kinds of emotion), and it tends to judge the value of the work according to its success in achieving that aim. This approach, which largely dominated literary discussion from the versified Art of Poetry by the Roman Horace (first century B.C.) through the eighteenth century, has been revived in re\u00ad cent rhetorical criticism, which emphasizes the artistic strategies by which an author engages and influences the responses of readers to the matters represented in a literary work. The pragmatic approach has also been adopted by some structuralists who analyze a literary text as a systematic play of codes which effect the interpretative re\u00ad sponses of the reader. (3) Expressive criticism treats a literary work primarily in relation to its author. It defines poetry as an expression, or overflow, or utterance of feelings, or as the product of the poet's imagination operating on his or her perceptions, thoughts, and feelings; it tends to judge the work by its sincerity, or its adequacy to the poet's individual vision or state of mind; and it often seeks in the work evidences of the particular 52 CRITICISM temperament and experiences of the author who, consciously or un\u00ad consciously, has revealed himself or herself in it. Such views were de\u00ad veloped mainly by romantic critics in the early nineteenth century and remain current in our own time, especially in the writings of psy\u00ad chological and psychoanalytic critics and in critics of consciousness such as George Poulet and the Geneva School. (4) Objective criticism deals with a work of literature as something which stands free from what is often called \"extrinsic\" relations to the poet, or to the audience, or to the environing world. Instead it de\u00ad scribes the literary product as a self-sufficient and autonomous ob\u00ad ject, or else as a world-in-itself, which is to be contemplated as its own end, and to be analyzed and judged solely by \"intrinsic\" criteria such as its complexity, coherence, equilibrium, integrity, and the in\u00ad terrelations of its component elements. The general viewpoint of the self-sufficiency of an aesthetic object was proposed in Kant's Critique of Aesthetic Judgment (1790)\u2014see distance and involvement\u2014-was taken up by proponents of art for art's sake in the latter part of the nine\u00ad teenth century, and has been elaborated in detailed modes of applied criticism by a number of important critics since the 1920s, including the New Critics, the Chicago School, and proponents of European for\u00ad malism. An essential enterprise that the ordinary reader takes for granted is to es\u00ad tablish the text of a literary work to be put in print; see the entry textual criti\u00ad cism. It is also a frequent procedure to distinguish types of criticism which bring to bear upon literature various areas of knowledge, in the attempt to identify the conditions and influences that determine the particular charac\u00ad teristics and values of a literary work. \"historical criti\u00ad cism,\" \"biographical criticism,\" \"sociological criticism\" (see sociology of literature and Marxist criticism), psychological criticism (a subspecies is psychoan\u00ad alytic criticism), and archetypal or myth criticism (which undertakes to explain the formation of types of literature by reference to the views about myth and ritual in modern cultural anthropology).

Sug\u00ad gested readings in current types of critical theory are included in the entry of this Glossary for each type. Cultural Studies designates a recent and rapidly growing cross-disciplinary enterprise for analyzing the conditions that effect the production, reception, and cultural significance of all types of institutions, practices, and products; among these, literature is accounted as merely one of many forms of cultural \"signifying practices.\" A chief concern is to specify the functioning of the so\u00ad cial, economic, and political forces and power-structures that produce all forms of cultural phenomena and endow them with their social \"meanings,\" their \"truth,\" the modes of discourse in which they are discussed, and their relative value and status. One precursor of modern cultural studies was Roland Barthes, who in Mythologies (1957, trans. 1972) analyzed the social conventions and \"codes\" that confer meanings in such social practices as women's fashions and profes\u00ad sional wrestling. (See Barthes under semiotics and structuralism.) Another was the British school of neo-Marxist studies of literature and art\u2014especially in their popular and working-class modes\u2014as an integral part of the general cul\u00ad ture. This movement was inaugurated by Raymond Williams' Culture and Soci\u00ad ety (1958) and by Richard Hoggart's The Uses of Literacy (1958, reprinted 1992), and it became institutionalized in the influential Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, founded by Hoggart in 1964. In the United States, the vogue for cultural studies had its roots mainly in the mode of literary and cultural criticism known as \"the new historicism,\" with its an\u00ad tecedents both in poststructural theorists such as Louis Althusser and Michel Foucault and in the treatment of culture as a set of signifying systems by Clif\u00ad ford Geertz and other cultural anthropologists. (See under new historicism.) A prominent endeavor in cultural studies is to subvert the distinctions in traditional criticism between \"high literature\" and \"high art\" and what were considered the lower forms that appeal to a much larger body of con\u00ad sumers. Typically, cultural studies pay less attention to works in the estab\u00ad lished literary canon than to popular fiction, best-selling romances (that is, love stories), journalism, and advertising, together with other arts that have mass appeal such as cartoon comics, film, television \"soap operas,\" and rock and rap music. And within the areas of literature and the more traditional 54 DECADENCE arts, a frequent undertaking is to move to the center of cultural study works that, it is claimed, have been marginalized or excluded by the aesthetic ide\u00ad ology of white European or American males, particularly the products of women, minority ethnic groups, and colonial and postcolonial writers. As in new historicist criticism, politically radical exponents of cultural studies ori\u00ad ent their writings and teaching toward the explicit end of reforming existing power-structures and relations, which they view as dominated by a privi\u00ad leged gender, race, or class. A conspicuous activity in cultural studies is the analysis and interpreta\u00ad tion of objects and social practices outside the realm of literature and the other arts; these phenomena are viewed as endowed with meanings that are the product of social forces and conventions, and that may either express or oppose the dominant structures of power in a culture. In theory, there is no limit to the kinds of things and patterns of behavior to which such an analy\u00ad sis of cultural \"texts\" may be applied; current studies deal with a spectrum ranging from the vogue of body-building through urban street fashions, and from cross-dressing to the social gesture of smoking a cigarette.

Jessica Munns and Gita Rajan, eds., A Cultural Studies Reader: History, Theory, Practice (1995) is a wide-ranging anthology that traces what we now call cultural studies as far back as Matthew Arnold in the Victorian era, then through the structural anthropology of Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss to many practitioners in the present day. Decadence. In the latter nineteenth-century, some French proponents of the doctrines of Aestheticism, especially Charles Baudelaire, also espoused views and values that developed into a movement called \"the Decadence.\" The term (not regarded by its exponents as derogatory) was based on qualities attributed to the literature of Hellenistic Greece in the last three centuries B.C., and to Roman literature after the death of the Emperor Augustus in 14 A.D. These lit\u00ad eratures were said to possess the high refinement and subtle beauties of a cul\u00ad ture and art that have passed their vigorous prime, but manifest a special savor of incipient decay. Such was also held to be the state of European civilization, especially in France, as it approached the end of the nineteenth century. Many of the precepts of the Decadence were voiced by Th\u00e9ophile Gautier in the \"Notice,\" describing Baudelaire's poetry, that he prefixed to an edition of Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal (\"Flowers of Evil\") in 1868. Central to the Decadent movement was the view that art is totally opposed to \"nature,\" in the sense both of biological nature and of the standard, or \"natural,\" norms of DECONSTRUCTION 55 morality and sexual behavior. The thoroughgoing Decadent writer cultivates high artifice in his style and, often, the bizarre in his subject matter, recoils from the fecundity and exuberance of the organic and instinctual life of na\u00ad ture, prefers elaborate dress over the living human form and cosmetics over the natural hue, and sometimes sets out to violate what is commonly held to be \"natural\" in human experience by resorting to drugs, deviancy from stan\u00ad dard norms of behavior, and sexual experimentation, in the attempt to achieve (in a phrase echoed from the French poet Arthur Rimbaud) \"the sys\u00ad tematic derangement of all the senses.\" The movement reached its height in the last two decades of the century; extreme products were the novel \u00c0 rebours (\"Against the Grain\"), written by J. K. Huysmans in 1884, and some of the paintings of Gustave Moreau. This period is also known as the fin de si\u00e8cle (end of the century); the phrase connotes the lassitude, satiety, and ennui ex\u00ad pressed by many writers of the Decadence. In England the ideas, moods, and behavior of Decadence were mani\u00ad fested, beginning in the 1860s, in the poems of Algernon Charles Swinburne, and in the 1890s by writers such as Oscar Wilde, Arthur Symons, Ernest Dow- son, and Lionel Johnson; the notable artist of the English Decadence was Aubrey Beardsley. In the search for strange sensations, a number of English Decadents of the 1890s experimented with drugs and espoused illicit, or what were conventionally held to be extra-natural, modes of sexual experience; several of them died young. Representative literary productions are Wilde's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891), his play Salom\u00e9 (1893), and many of the poems of Ernest Dowson. The emphases of the Decadence on drugged perception, sexual experi\u00ad mentation, and the deliberate inversion of conventional moral, social, and artistic norms reappeared, with modern variations, in the Beat poets and nov\u00ad elists of the 1950s and in the counterculture of the decades that followed.

Dowling, Aestheticism and Decadence: A Selective Annotated Bibliography (1977). Deconstruction, as applied in the criticism of literature, designates a the\u00ad ory and practice of reading which questions and claims to \"subvert\" or \"un\u00ad dermine\" the assumption that the system of language provides grounds that are adequate to establish the boundaries, the coherence or unity, and the de\u00ad terminate meanings of a literary text. Typically, a deconstructive reading sets out to show that conflicting forces within the text itself serve to dissipate the seeming definiteness of its structure and meanings into an indefinite array of incompatible and undecidable possibilities. The originator and namer of deconstruction is the French thinker Jacques Derrida, among whose precursors were Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900) and 56 DECONSTRUCTION Martin Heidegger (1889-1976)\u2014German philosophers who put to radical question fundamental philosophical concepts such as \"knowledge,\" \"truth,\" and \"identity\"\u2014as well as Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), whose psychoanalysis violated traditional concepts of a coherent individual consciousness and a uni\u00ad tary self. Derrida presented his basic views in three books, all published in 1967, entitled Of Grammatology, Writing and Difference, and Speech and Phenom\u00ad ena; since then he has reiterated, expanded, and applied those views in a rapid sequence of publications. Derrida's writings are complex and elusive, and the summary here can only indicate some of their main tendencies. His point of vantage is what, in Of Grammatology, he calls \"the axial proposition that a pas de hors-texte\"). Like all Derrida's key terms and statements, this has multiple significations, but a primary one is that a reader cannot get beyond verbal signs to any things-in-themselves which, because they are independent of the system of language, might serve to anchor a determinable meaning. Derrida's reiterated claim is that not only all Western philosophies and theories of language, but all Western uses of language, hence all Western culture, are logocentric; that is, they are centered or grounded on a \"logos\" (which in Greek signified both \"word\" and \"rationality\") or, as stated in a phrase he adopts from Heidegger, they rely on \"the metaphysics of presence.\" They are logocentric, according to Derrida, in part because they are phonocentric; that is, they grant, implic\u00ad itly or explicitly, logical \"priority,\" or \"privilege,\" to speech over writing as the model for analyzing all discourse. By logos, or presence, Derrida signifies what he also calls an \"ultimate referent\"\u2014a self-certifying and self-sufficient ground, or foundation, available to us totally outside the play of language it\u00ad self, that is directly present to our awareness and serves to \"center\" (that is, to anchor, organize, and guarantee) the structure of the linguistic system, and as a result suffices to fix the bounds, coherence, and determinate meanings of any spoken or written utterance within that system. (On Derrida's \"decenter- ing\" of structuralism, see poststructuralism.) Historical instances of claimed foundations for language are God as the guarantor of its validity, or a Platonic form of the true reference of a general term, or a Hegelian \"telos\" or goal to\u00ad ward which all process strives, or an intention to signify something determi\u00ad nate that is directly present to the awareness of the person who initiates an utterance. Derrida undertakes to show that these and all other attempts by Western philosophy to establish an absolute ground in presence, and all im\u00ad plicit reliance on such a ground in using language, are bound to fail. Espe\u00ad cially, he directs his skeptical exposition against the phonocentric assumption\u2014which he regards as central in Western theories of language\u2014 that at the instant of speaking, the \"intention\" of a speaker to mean some\u00ad thing determinate by an utterance is immediately and fully present in the speaker's consciousness, and is also communicable to an auditor. (See inten\u00ad tion, under interpretation and hermeneutics.) In Derrida's view, we must always say more, and other, than we intend to say. DECONSTRUCTION Derrida expresses his alternative conception that the play of linguistic meanings is \"undecidable\" in terms derived from Saussure's view that in a sign- system, both the signifiers (the material elements of a language, whether spoken or written) and the signifieds (their conceptual meanings) owe their seeming identities, not to their own \"positive\" or inherent features, but to their \"differ\u00ad ences\" from other speech-sounds, written marks, or conceptual significations. (See Saussure, in linguistics in modern criticism and in semiotics.) From this view Derrida evolves his radical claim that the features that, in any particular utter\u00ad ance, would serve to establish the signified meaning of a word, are never \"pres\u00ad ent\" to us in their own positive identity, since both these features and their significations are nothing other than a network of differences. On the other hand, neither can these identifying features be said to be strictly \"absent\"; in\u00ad stead, in any spoken or written utterance, the seeming meaning is the result only of a \"self-effacing\" trace\u2014self-effacing in that one is not aware of it\u2014 which consists of all the nonpresent differences from other elements in the lan\u00ad guage system that invest the utterance with its \"effect\" of having a meaning in its own right. The consequence, in Derrida's view, is that we can never, in any instance of speech or writing, have a demonstrably fixed and decidable present meaning. He says that the differential play (jeu) of language may produce the \"effects\" of decidable meanings in an utterance or text, but asserts that these are merely effects and lack a ground that would justify certainty in interpretation. In a characteristic move, Derrida coins the portmanteau term diff\u00e9rance, in which, he says, he uses the spelling \"-ance\" instead of \"-enee\" to indicate a fusion of two senses of the French verb \"diff\u00e9rer\": to be different, and to defer. This double sense points to the phenomenon that, on the one hand, a text proffers the \"effect\" of having a significance that is the product of its differ\u00ad ence, but that on the other hand, since this proffered significance can never come to rest in an actual \"presence\"\u2014or in a language-independent reality Derrida calls a transcendental signified\u2014its determinate specification is de\u00ad ferred from one linguistic interpretation to another in a movement or \"play,\" as Derrida puts it, en ab\u00eeme\u2014that is, in an endless regress. To Derrida's view, then, it is difference that makes possible the meaning whose possibility (as a decidable meaning) it necessarily baffles. As Derrida says in another of his coinages, the meaning of any spoken or written utterance, by the action of opposing internal linguistic forces, is ineluctably disseminated\u2014a term which includes, among its deliberately contradictory significations, that of having an effect of meaning (a \"semantic\" effect), of dispersing meanings among innumerable alternatives, and of negating any specific meaning. There is thus no ground, in the incessant play of difference that constitutes any language, for attributing a decidable meaning, or even a finite set of de- terminately multiple meanings (which he calls \"polysemism\"), to any utter\u00ad ance that we speak or write. (What Derrida calls \"polysemism\" is what William Empson called \"ambiguity\"; see ambiguity.) As Derrida puts it in Writ\u00ad ing and Difference: \"The absence of a transcendental signified extends the do\u00ad main and the play of signification infinitely\" (p. 280). 58 DECONSTRUCTION Several of Derrida's skeptical procedures have been especially influential in deconstructive literary criticism. One is to subvert the innumerable binary oppositions\u2014such as speech/writing, nature/culture, truth/error, male/fe\u00ad male\u2014which are essential structural elements in logocentric language. Derrida shows that such oppositions constitute a tacit hierarchy, in which the first term functions as privileged and superior and the second term as derivative and inferior. Derrida's procedure is to invert the hierarchy, by showing that the secondary term can be made out to be derivative from, or a special case of, the primary term; but instead of stopping at this reversal, he goes on to destabilize both hierarchies, leaving them in a condition of undecidability. (Among de\u00ad constructive literary critics, one such demonstration is to take the standard hi\u00ad erarchical opposition of literature/criticism, to invert it so as to make criticism primary and literature secondary, and then to represent, as an undecidable set of oppositions, the assertions that criticism is a species of literature and that lit\u00ad erature is a species of criticism.) A second operation influential in literary criti\u00ad cism is Derrida's deconstruction of any attempt to establish a securely deter\u00ad minate bound, or limit, or margin, to a textual work so as to differentiate what is \"inside\" from what is \"outside\" the work. A third operation is his analysis of the inherent nonlogicality, or \"rhetoricity\"\u2014that is, the inescapable reliance on rhetorical figures and figurative language\u2014in all uses of language, including in what philosophers have traditionally claimed to be the strictly literal and logi\u00ad cal arguments of philosophy. Derrida, for example, emphasizes the indispensa\u00ad ble reliance in all modes of discourse on metaphors that are assumed to be merely convenient substitutes for literal, or \"proper\" meanings; then he under\u00ad takes to show, on the one hand, that metaphors cannot be reduced to literal meanings but, on the other hand, that supposedly literal terms are themselves metaphors whose metaphoric nature has been forgotten. Derrida's characteristic way of proceeding is not to lay out his decon\u00ad structive concepts and operations in a systematic exposition, but to allow them to emerge in a sequence of exemplary close readings of passages from writings that range from Plato through Jean-Jacques Rousseau to the present era\u2014writings that, by standard classification, are mainly philosophical, al\u00ad though occasionally literary. He describes his procedure as a \"double read\u00ad ing.\" Initially, that is, he interprets a text as, in the standard fashion, \"lisible\" (readable or intelligible), since it engenders \"effects\" of having determinate meanings. But this reading, Derrida says, is only \"provisional,\" as a stage to\u00ad ward a second, or deconstructive \"critical reading,\" which disseminates the provisional meaning into an indefinite range of significations that, he claims, always involve (in a term taken from logic) an aporia\u2014an insuperable dead\u00ad lock, or \"double bind,\" of incompatible or contradictory meanings which are \"undecidable,\" in that we lack any sufficient ground for choosing among them. The result, in Derrida's rendering, is that each text deconstructs itself, by undermining its own supposed grounds and dispersing itself into incoher\u00ad ent meanings in a way, he claims, that the deconstructive reader neither initi\u00ad ates nor produces; deconstruction is something that simply \"happens\" in a critical reading. Derrida asserts, furthermore, that he has no option except to DECONSTRUCTION 59 attempt to communicate his deconstructive readings in the prevailing logo- centric language, hence that his own interpretive texts deconstruct them\u00ad selves in the very act of deconstructing the texts to which they are applied. He insists, however, that \"deconstruction has nothing to do with destruction,\" and that all the standard uses of language will inevitably go on; what he un\u00ad dertakes, he says, is merely to \"situate\" or \"reinscribe\" any text in a system of difference which shows the instability of the effects to which the text owes its seeming intelligibility. Derrida did not propose deconstruction as a mode of literary criticism, but as a way of reading all kinds of texts so as to reveal and subvert the tacit metaphysical presuppositions of Western thought. His views and procedures, however, have been taken up by literary critics, especially in America, who have adapted Derrida's \"critical reading\" to the kind of close reading of partic\u00ad ular literary texts which had earlier been the familiar procedure of the New Criticism; they do so, however, Paul de Man has said, in a way which reveals that new-critical close readings \"were not nearly close enough.\" The end re\u00ad sults of the two kinds of close reading are utterly diverse. New Critical expli\u00ad cations of texts had undertaken to show that a great literary work, in the tight internal relations of its figurative and paradoxical meanings, constitutes a freestanding, bounded, and organic entity of multiplex yet determinate meanings. On the contrary, a radically deconstructive close reading under\u00ad takes to show that a literary text lacks a \"totalized\" boundary that makes it an entity, much less an organic unity; also that the text, by a play of internal counter-forces, disseminates into an indefinite range of self-conflicting signi\u00ad fications. The claim is made by some deconstructive critics that a literary text is superior to nonliterary texts, but only because, by its self-reference, it shows itself to be more aware of features that all texts inescapably share: its fiction- ality, its lack of a genuine ground, and especially its patent \"rhetoricity,\" or use of figurative procedures\u2014features that make any \"right reading\" or \"cor\u00ad rect reading\" of a text impossible. Paul de Man was the most innovative and influential of the critics who applied deconstruction to the reading of literary texts. In de Man's later writ\u00ad ings, he represented the basic conflicting forces within a text under the head\u00ad ings of \"grammar\" (the code or rules of language) and \"rhetoric\" (the unruly play of figures and tropes), and aligned these with other opposed forces, such as the \"constative\" and \"performative\" linguistic functions that had been dis\u00ad tinguished by John Austin (see speech-act theory). In its grammatical aspect, language persistently aspires to determinate, referential, and logically ordered assertions, which are persistently dispersed by its rhetorical aspect into an open set of non-referential and illogical possibilities. A literary text, then, of inner necessity says one thing and performs another, or as de Man alterna\u00ad tively puts the matter, a text \"simultaneously asserts and denies the authority of its own rhetorical mode\" (Allegories of Reading, 1979, p. 17). The inevitable result, for a critical reading, is an aporia of \"vertiginous possibilities.\" Barbara Johnson, once a student of de Man's, has applied deconstructive readings not only to literary texts, but to the writings of other critics, including DECONSTRUCTION Derrida himself. Her succinct statement of the aim and methods of a decon- structive reading is often cited: Deconstruction is not synonymous with destruction The de-construction of a text does not proceed by random doubt or arbitrary subversion, but by the careful teasing out of warring forces of signification within the text itself. If anything is destroyed in a deconstructive reading, it is not the text, but the claim to unequivocal domination of one mode of signi\u00ad fying over another. (The Critical Difference, 1980, p. 5) J. Hillis Miller, once the leading American representative of the Geneva School of consciousness-criticism, is now one of the most prominent of de- constructors, known especially for his application of this type of critical read\u00ad ing to prose fiction. Miller's statement of his critical practice indicates how drastic the result may be of applying to works of literature the concepts and procedures that Derrida had developed for deconstructing the foundations of Western metaphysics: Deconstruction as a mode of interpretation works by a careful and cir\u00ad cumspect entering of each textual labyrinth.... The deconstructive critic seeks to find, by this process of retracing, the element in the system studied which is alogical, the thread in the text in question which will unravel it all, or the loose stone which will pull down the whole build\u00ad ing. The deconstruction, rather, annihilates the ground on which the building stands by showing that the text has already annihilated the ground, knowingly or unknowingly. Deconstruction is not a disman\u00ad tling of the structure of a text but a demonstration that it has already dis\u00ad mantled itself. Miller's conclusion is that any literary text, as a ceaseless play of \"irreconcil\u00ad able\" and \"contradictory\" meanings, is \"indeterminable\" \"undecidable\"; hence, reading is necessarily misreading.\" Rock and Criti\u00ad cism as Cure, II,\" in Miller's Theory Then and Now [1991], p. 126, and \"Walter Pater: A Partial Portrait,\" Daedalus, Vol. 105, 1976.)

Taylor, ed., Deconstruction in Context (1986); Christopher Nor- ris, Paul de Man (1988). Among the many critiques of Derrida and of various practitioners of deconstructive literary criticism are Terry Eagleton, The Func\u00ad tion of Criticism (1984); M. H. Abrams, \"The to Do Things with Texts,\" and \"Construing and Deconstructing,\" in Doing Things with Texts (1989); John M. Ellis, Against Deconstruction (1989); Wendell V. Harris, ed., Beyond Poststructuralism (1996). Decorum, as a term in literary criticism, designates the view that there should be propriety, or fitness, in the way that a literary genre, its subject mat\u00ad ter, its characters and actions, and the style of its narration and dialogue are matched to one another. The doctrine had its roots in classical theory, espe\u00ad cially in the versified essay Art of Poetry by the Roman Horace in the first cen\u00ad tury B.C. It achieved an elaborate form in the criticism and composition of literature in the Renaissance and the Neoclassic age, when (as John Milton put it in his essay Of Education, 1644) decorum became \"the grand masterpiece to observe.\" In the most rigid application of this standard, literary forms, char\u00ad acters, and style were ordered in hierarchies, or \"levels,\" from high through middle to low, and all these elements had to be matched to one another. Thus comedy must not be mixed with tragedy, and the highest and most serious genres (epic and tragedy) must represent characters of the highest social classes (kings and nobility) acting in a way appropriate to their status and speaking in the high style. A number of critics in this period, however, espe\u00ad cially in England, maintained the theory of decorum only in limited ways. Thomas Rymer (1641-1713) was an English proponent, and Samuel Johnson (1709-84) was a notable opponent of the strict form of literary decorum. See neoclassic and romantic, poetic diction, and style, and refer to Vernon Hall, Renaissance Literary Criticism: A Study of Its Social Content (1945). Erich Auerbach's Mimesis (1953) describes the sustained conflict in postclassical Eu\u00ad rope between the reigning doctrines of literary decorum and the example of the Bible, in which the highest matters, including the sublime tragedy of the life and passion of Christ, are intermingled with base characters and humble narrative detail and are treated with what seemed to a classical taste a blatant indecorum of style. For Wordsworth's deliberate inversion of traditional deco\u00ad rum at the beginning of the nineteenth century, by investing the common, the lowly, and the trivial with the highest dignity and sublimity, see M. H. Abrams, Natural Supernaturalism (1971), pp. 390-408. 62 DEISM \u00b7 DIALOGIC CRITICISM Deism. A widespread mode of religious thinking that manifested the faith in human reason that characterized the European Enlightenment during the latter seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries. Deism has been succinctly de\u00ad scribed as \"religion without as violating reason, all \"revealed religion\"\u2014that is, all particular religions, in\u00ad cluding Christianity, which are based on faith in the truths revealed in special scriptures at a certain time and place, and therefore available only to a partic\u00ad ular individual or group. The deist instead relied on those truths which, it was claimed, prove their accord with universal human reason by the fact that they are to be found in all religions, everywhere, at all times. Therefore the basic tenets of deism\u2014for example, that there is a deity, discoverable by reasoning from the creation to the creator, who deserves our worship and sanctions all moral values\u2014were, in theory, the elements shared by all particular, or \"posi\u00ad tive,\" religions. Many thinkers assimilated aspects of deism while remaining professing Christians. Alexander Pope, without renouncing his Catholicism, expressed succinctly the basic tenets of deism in his poem \"The Universal Prayer\" (1738), which begins Father of all! in every age, In every clime adored, By saint, by savage, and by sage, Jehovah, Jove, or Lord! Deus ex Machina is Latin for \"a god from a machine.\" It describes the practice of some Greek playwrights (especially Euripides) to end a drama with a god, lowered to the stage by a mechanical apparatus, who by his judgment and commands resolved the dilemmas of the human characters. The phrase is now used for any forced and improbable device\u2014a telltale birthmark, an un\u00ad expected inheritance, the discovery of a lost will or letter\u2014by which a hard- pressed author resolves a plot. Conspicuous examples occur even in major novels like Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist (1837-38) and Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles (1891). The German playwright Bertolt Brecht parodies the abuse of such devices in the madcap conclusion of his Threepenny Opera (1928). See plot. Dialogic Criticism is modeled on the theory and critical procedures of the Soviet critic Mikhail Bakhtin who, although he published his major works in the 1920s and 1930s, remained virtually unknown to the West until the 1980s, when translations of his writings gave him a wide and rapidly increas\u00ad ing influence. To Bakhtin a literary work is not (as in various poststructural theories) a text whose meanings are produced by the play of impersonal lin\u00ad guistic or economic or cultural forces, but a site for the dialogic interaction of multiple voices, or modes of discourse, each of which is not merely a verbal but a social phenomenon, and as such is the product of manifold deter\u00ad minants that are specific to a class, social group, and speech community. A person's speech, composed of languages from diverse social contexts, does not express a ready-made and autonomous individuality; instead, his or her DIALOGIC CRITICISM 63 character emerges in the course of the dialogue and is composed of languages from diverse social contexts. Each utterance, furthermore, whether in actual life or as represented in literature, owes its precise inflection and meaning to a number of attendant factors\u2014the specific social situation in which it is spo\u00ad ken, the relation of its speaker to an actual or anticipated listener, and the re\u00ad lation of the utterance to the prior utterances to which it is (explicitly or implicitly) a response. Bakhtin's prime interest was in the novel, and especially in the ways that the voices that constitute the text of any novel disrupt the authority of the author's single voice. In Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics (1929, trans, by Caryl Emerson, 1984), he contrasts the monologic novels of writers such as Leo Tol\u00ad stoy\u2014which undertake to subordinate the voices of all the characters to the authoritative discourse and controlling purposes of the author\u2014to the dia\u00ad logic form (or \"polyphonic form\") of Fyodor Dostoevsky's novels, in which the characters are liberated to speak \"a plurality of independent and un- merged voices and consciousnesses, a genuine polyphony of fully valid voices.\" In Bakhtin's view, however, a novel can never be totally monologic, since the narrator's reports of the utterances of another character are in\u00ad escapably \"double-voiced\" (in that we can distinguish therein the author's own accent and inflection), and also dialogic (in that the author's discourse continually reinforces, alters, or contests with the types of speech that it re\u00ad ports). In Rabelais and His World (trans., 1984), Bakhtin proposed his widely cited concept of the camivalesque in certain literary works. This literary mode parallels the flouting of authority and inversion of social hierarchies that, in many cultures, are permitted in a season of carnival. It does so by in\u00ad troducing a mingling of voices from diverse social levels that are free to mock and subvert authority, to flout social norms by ribaldry, and to exhibit various ways of profaning what is ordinarily regarded as sacrosanct. Bakhtin traces the occurrence of the camivalesque in ancient, medieval, and Renaissance writers (especially in Rabelais); he also asserts that the mode recurs later, espe\u00ad cially in the play of irreverent, parodie, and subversive voices in the novels of Dostoevsky, which are both dialogic and camivalesque. In an essay on \"Discourse in the Novel\" (1934-35), Bakhtin develops his view that the novel is constituted by a multiplicity of divergent and contend\u00ad ing social voices that achieve their full significance only in the process of their dialogic interaction both with each other and with the voice of the narrator. Bakhtin explicitly sets his theory against Aristotle's Poetics, which proposed that the primary component in narrative forms is a plot that evolves coher\u00ad ently from its beginning to an end in which all complications are resolved {see plot). Instead, Bakhtin elevates discourse (equivalent to Aristotle's subordi\u00ad nate element of diction) into the primary component of a narrative work; and he describes discourse as a medley of voices, social attitudes, and values that are not only opposed, but irreconcilable, with the result that the work re\u00ad mains unresolved and open-ended. Although he wrote during the Stalinist regime in Russia, Bakhtin's libertarian and open concept of the literary narra\u00ad tive is obviously, although tacitly, opposed to the Soviet version of Marxist 64 DIALOGIC CRITICISM criticism, which stresses the way a novel either reflects or distorts the true so\u00ad cial reality, or expresses only a single dominant ideology, or should exemplify a \"social realism\" that accords with an authoritarian party line. See Marxist criticism and, for a discussion of the complex issue of Bakhtin's relation to Marxism and Soviet literary criticism, Simon Dentith, Bakhtinian Thought: An Introductory Reader (1995), pp. 8-21. Bakhtin's views have been, in some part and in diverse ways, incorpo\u00ad rated by representatives of various types of critical theory and practice, whether traditional or poststructural. Among current students of literature, those who are identified specifically as \"dialogic critics\" follow Bakhtin's ex\u00ad ample by proposing that the primary component in the constitution of nar\u00ad rative works, or of literature generally\u2014and of general culture as well\u2014is a plurality of contending and mutually qualifying social voices, with no possi\u00ad bility of a decisive resolution into a monologic truth. Self-reflexively, a thor\u00ad oughgoing dialogic critic, in accordance with Bakhtin's own views, considers his own critical writings to be simply one voice among many in the con\u00ad tention of critical theories and practices, which coexist in a sustained tension of opposition and mutual definition. As Don Bialostosky, a chief spokesman for dialogic criticism, has voiced its rationale and ideal: As a self-conscious practice, dialogic criticism turns its inescapable in\u00ad volvement with some other voices into a program of articulating itself with all the other voices of the discipline, the culture, or the world of cultures to which it makes itself responsible.... Neither a live-and-let- live relativism nor a settle-it-once-and-for-all authoritarianism but a strenuous and open-ended dialogism would keep them talking to them\u00ad selves and to one another, discovering their affinities without resting in them and clarifying their differences without resolving them.

Douglas Atkins and Laura Morrow, eds., Contemporary Literary Theory, 1989, pp. 223-24) See the related critical enterprise called discourse analysis; and in addition to the writings mentioned above, refer to Mikhail Bakhtin's The Dialogic Imag\u00ad ination, ed. Michael Holquist (1981) and Speech Genres and Other Late Essays, ed. Caryl Emerson and Michael Holquist (1986). For Bakhtin's life and intel\u00ad lectual views, with attention to the problem of identifying writings that Bakhtin published under the names of various of his colleagues, see Katerina Clark and Michael Holquist, Mikhail Bakhtin (1984), and Gary Saul Morson and Caryl Emerson, Mikhail Bakhtin: Creation of a Poetics (1990). An influential early exposition that publicized Bakhtin's ideas in the West was Tzvetan Todorov, Mikhail Bakhtin: The Dialogical Principle (1984); a later book describ\u00ad ing the wide dissemination of these ideas is David Lodge's After Bakhtin (1990); and a recent application of dialogic criticism is Don H. Bialostosky, Wordsworth, Dialogics, and the Practice of Criticism (1992). For a critical view of Bakhtin's claims, see Ren\u00e9 Wellek, A History of Modern Criticism 1750-1950, Vol. 7 (1991), pp. 354-71. DIDACTIC LITERATURE 65 Didactic Literature. The adjective \"didactic,\" which means \"intended to give instruction,\" is applied to works of literature that are designed to ex\u00ad pound a branch of knowledge, or else to embody, in imaginative or fictional form, a moral, religious, or philosophical doctrine or theme. Such works are commonly distinguished from essentially imaginative works (sometimes called \"mimetic\" or \"representational\") in which the materials are organized and rendered, not in order to enhance the appeal of the doctrine they em\u00ad body, but in order to enhance their intrinsic interest and their capacity to move and give artistic pleasure to an audience. In the first century B.C. the Roman Lucretius wrote his didactic poem De Rerum Natura (\"On the Nature of Things\") to expound and make persuasive and appealing his naturalistic phi\u00ad losophy and ethics, and in the same era Virgil wrote his Georgics, in which the poetic elements serve to add aesthetic appeal to a laudation of rural life and information about the practical management of a farm. Most medieval and much Renaissance literature was didactic in intention. In the eighteenth cen\u00ad tury, a number of poets wrote georgics (on the model of Virgil) describing in verse such utilitarian arts as sheepherding, running a sugar plantation, and making cider. Alexander Pope's Essay on Criticism and his Essay on Man are eighteenth-century didactic poems on the subjects of literary criticism and of moral philosophy. Such works for the most part directly expound the principles and proce\u00ad dures of a branch of knowledge or a craft, or else argue an explicit doctrine by proofs and examples. Didactic literature, however, may also take on the at\u00ad tributes of imaginative works, by embodying the doctrine in a fictional narra\u00ad tive or dramatic form that is intended to enhance its human interest and persuasive force, as well as to add a dimension of pleasure in the artistry of the representation. In the various forms of allegory, for example, including Ed\u00ad mund Spenser's The Faerie Queene and John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, the purpose of enhancing and adding force to the incorporated doctrine is a pri\u00ad mary determinant of the choice and presentation of characters, the evolution of the plot, and the invention of fictional details. The diverse types of satire are didactic in that they are designed, by various devices of ridicule, to alter the reader's attitudes toward certain types of people, institutions, products, and modes of conduct. Dante's Letter to Can Grande tells us that he planned his fourteenth-century Divine Comedy to represent, in the mode of a visionary narrative, the major Christian truths and the way to avoid damnation and achieve salvation. And John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667) can also be called didactic to the extent that the narrative is in fact organized, as Milton claimed in his opening invocation, around his \"great argument\" to \"assert Eternal Providence, / And justify the ways of God to men.\" It will be seen from these examples that \"didactic literature,\" as here defined, is an analytical distinc\u00ad tion and not a derogatory term; also that the distinction is not absolute but a matter of relative emphasis on instructing and persuading an audience, as against rendering a subject so as to maximize its power to move and give artis\u00ad tic delight in its own right. The plays of Bernard Shaw and Bertolt Brecht 66 DISCOURSE ANALYSIS manifest a fine balance of didactic intention, imaginative invention, and artistic enhancement. And some literary masterpieces are primarily didactic, while others (Shakespeare's King Lear, Jane Austen's Emma, James Joyce's Ulysses)\u2014even though their plots involve moral concerns and imply criteria for moral judgments\u2014are primarily, to adopt a phrase by Samuel Taylor Cole\u00ad ridge, works \"of pure imagination.\" The term propagandist literature is sometimes used as the equivalent of didactic literature, but it is more useful to reserve the term for that species of didactic work which patently is organized and rendered to induce the reader to assume a specific attitude toward, or to take direct action on, a pressing so\u00ad cial, political, or religious issue of the time at which the work is written. Prominent and effective examples of such works are Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852, attacking slavery in the South), Upton Sinclair's The Jungle (1906, on the horrors of the unregulated slaughtering and meat\u00ad packing industry in Chicago), and Clifford Odets' Waiting for Lefty (1935, a play directed against the strong-arm tactics used to suppress a taxicab drivers' union). The socialist realism that was the official doctrine of the former Soviet Union was essentially a propagandist mode of literature. See fiction, and refer to John Chalker, The English Ge\u00f2rgie: A Study in the Development of a Form (1969). On a useful way to distinguish between primar\u00ad ily didactic and primarily imaginative, or \"mimetic,\" literature, see R. S. Crane, ed., Critics and Criticism (1952), especially pp. 63-68 and 589-94. Discourse Analysis. Traditional linguists and philosophers of language, as well as literary students of style and stylistics, have typically focused their analyses on isolated units of language\u2014the sentence, or even single words, phrases, and figures\u2014in abstraction from the specific circumstances of an ut\u00ad terance. Discourse analysis, on the other hand, as inaugurated in the 1970s, concerns itself with the use of language in a running discourse, continued over a sequence of sentences, and involving the interaction of speaker (or writer) and auditor (or reader) in a specific situational context, and within a framework of social and cultural conventions. Emphasis on discourse as occurring within specific cultural conditions and under particular circumstances derives from a number of investigators and areas of research, including the work of Hans-Georg Gadamer in hermeneutics, the concern of Michel Foucault with the institutional conditions and power- structures that serve to make given statements accepted as authoritative or true, and the work of Clifford Geertz and other cultural anthropologists on the rootedness of linguistic and other meanings in the social forms and practices specific to a cultural community. (See the above writers, under interpretation and hermeneutics and new historicism.) The current use of discourse analysis in literary studies was given special impetus by the speech-act philosopher H. P. Grice, who in 1975 coined the term implicature to account for indirection in discourse; for example, to explain how we are able to identify the illocutionary force of an utterance that lacks an explicit indicator of its illocutionary in\u00ad tention. (See speech-act theory.) Thus, how can we account for the fact that the DISSOCIATION OF SENSIBILITY 67 utterance, \"Can you pass the salt?\" although it is in the syntactical form of a question, can be used by the speaker, and correctly understood by the hearer, as a polite form of request? (H. P. Grice, \"Logic and Conversation,\" 1975, reprinted in his Studies in the Way of Words, 1989.) Grice proposed that users of a language share a set of implicit expectations which he calls the \"commu\u00ad nicative presumption\"\u2014for example, that an utterance is intended by a speaker to be true, clear, and above all relevant. If an utterance seems pur\u00ad posely to violate these expectations, we seek to make sense of it by transferring it to a context in which it is clearly appropriate. Other language theorists have continued Grice's analysis of the collective assumptions that help to make ut\u00ad terances meaningful and intelligible, and serve also to make a sustained dis\u00ad course a coherent development of signification instead of a mere collocation of independent sentences. One such assumption is that the hearer shares with the speaker (or the reader shares with the writer) a large body of nonlinguistic knowledge and experience; another is that the speaker is using language in a way that is intentional, purposive, and in accordance with linguistic and cul\u00ad tural conventions; a third is that there is a shared knowledge of the complex ways in which the meaning of a locution varies with the particular situation, as well as with the type of discourse, in which it is uttered. Some proponents of stylistics include discourse analysis within their area of investigation. (See stylistics.) And since the late 1970s, a number of critics have increasingly adapted discourse analysis to the examination of the dialogue in novels and dramas. A chief aim is to explain how the characters represented in a literary work, and also the readers of that work, are constantly able to infer meanings that are not asserted or specified in a conversational interchange. The claim is that such inferences are \"rule-governed,\" in that they depend on sets of assumptions, shared by users and interpreters of discourse that come into play to establish meanings, and furthermore, that these meanings vary systematically, in accordance with whether the rule-guided expectations are fulfilled or intentionally violated. Such explorations of conversational dis\u00ad course in literature often extend to the re-analysis of point of view and other traditional topics in the criticism of literary narratives. (Compare the entry on dialogic criticism.) See Malcolm Coulthard, An Introduction to Discourse Analysis (1977); Gillian Brown and George Yule, Discourse Analysis (1983); Teun A. van Dijk and Walter Kintsch, Strategies of Discourse Comprehension (1983); Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson, Relevance: Communication and Cognition (1986), Wendell V. Harris, Interpretive Acts (1988), chapter 2. Dissociation of Sensibility was a phrase introduced by T. S. Eliot in his essay \"The Metaphysical Poets\" (1921). Eliot's claim was that John Donne and the other metaphysical poets of the earlier seventeenth century, like the Eliza\u00ad bethan and Jacobean dramatists, \"possessed a mechanism of sensibility which could devour any kind of experience.\" They manifested \"a direct sensuous ap\u00ad prehension of thought,\" and felt \"their thought as immediately as the odour of a rose.\" But \"in the seventeenth century a dissociation of sensibility set in, 68 DISTANCE AND INVOLVEMENT from which we have never recovered.\" This dissociation of intellection from emotion and sensuous perception, according to Eliot, was greatly aggravated by the influence of John Milton and John Dryden; and most later poets in English either thought or felt, but did not think and feel as an act of unified sensibility. Eliot's vaguely defined distinction had a great vogue, especially among American New Critics. The dissociation of sensibility was taken to be the fea\u00ad ture that weakened most poetry between Milton and the later writings of W. B. Yeats, and was attributed particularly to the development, in the seven\u00ad teenth century, of the scientific conception of reality as a material universe stripped of human values and feeling. (See, for example, Basil Willey, The Sev\u00ad enteenth Century Background, 1934.) Especially since 1950, however, Eliot's conception of a sudden but persisting dissociation of sensibility has come in for strong criticism, on the ground that it is an invalid historical claim that was contrived to support Eliot's disapproval (as a political and social conser\u00ad vative) of the course of English intellectual, political, and religious history after the Civil War of 1642, as well as to rationalize Eliot's particular poetic preferences. See T. S. Eliot, \"The Metaphysical Poets,\" Selected Essays (2d ed., 1960), and \"Milton II,\" On Poetry and Poets (1957). Attacks on the validity of the doc\u00ad trine are Leonard Unger, Donne's Poetry and Modern Criticism (1950), and Frank Kermode, Romantic Image (1957), Chapter 8. Distance and Involvement. In his Critique of Judgment (1790), Immanuel Kant analyzed the experience of an aesthetic object as an act of \"contempla\u00ad tion\" which is \"disinterested\" (that is, independent of one's personal interests and desires) and free from reference to the object's reality, moral effect, or util\u00ad ity. Various philosophers of art developed this concept into attempts to dis\u00ad tinguish \"aesthetic experience\" from all other kinds of experience, on the basis of the impersonality and disinterestedness with which we contemplate an aesthetic object or work of art. Writing in 1912, Edward Bullough intro\u00ad duced the term \"distance\" into this type of theory. He points, for example, to the difference between our ordinary experience of a dense fog at sea, with its strains, anxiety, and fear of invisible dangers, and an aesthetic experience, in which we attend with delight to the \"objective\" features and sensuous quali\u00ad ties of the fog itself. This aesthetic mode of experiencing the fog is, Bullough affirms, the effect of \"psychical distance,\" which \"is obtained by separating the object and its appeal from one's own self, by putting it out of gear with practical needs and ends.\" The degree of this psychical distance varies accord\u00ad ing to the nature of the artistic object that we contemplate, and also in accor\u00ad dance with an \"individual's capacity for maintaining a greater or lesser degree\" of such distance. In recent literary criticism the term aesthetic distance, or simply dis\u00ad tance, is often used not only to define the nature of literary and aesthetic experience in general, but also to analyze the many devices by which authors control the degree of a reader's distance, or \"detachment\"\u2014which is in DOGGEREL \u00b7 DRAMA 69 inverse relationship to the degree of a reader's involvement, or \"concern\"\u2014 with the actions and fortunes of one or another character represented within a work of literature. See, for example, Wayne C. Booth's detailed analysis of the control of distance in Jane Austen's Emma, in The Rhetoric of Fiction (1961), chapter 9. See Edward Bullough, \"Psychical Distance as a Factor in Art and an Aes\u00ad thetic Principle,\" British Journal of Psychology 5 (1912), reprinted in Melvin Rader, ed., A Modern Book of Aesthetics (rev., 1952). A useful review of theories of the aesthetic attitude and of aesthetic distance is Jerome Stollnitz, Aesthet\u00ad ics and the Philosophy of Art Criticism (1960), chapter 2. For the view that such theories are mistaken, see George Dickie, Art and the Aesthetic (1974), chapters 4 and 5. Doggerel. A term applied to rough, heavy-footed, and jerky versification, and also to verses that are monotonously regular in meter and tritely conven\u00ad tional in sentiment. Doggerel is usually the result of ineptitude on the part of the versifier, but is sometimes deliberately employed by poets for satiric, comic, or rollicking effect. John Skelton (14607-1529) wrote short lines of two or three stresses, intentionally rough and variable in meter, which have come to be called Skeltonics; as he both described and exemplified his versification in Colin Clout: For though my rhyme be ragged, Tattered and jagged, Rudely rain-beaten, Rusty and moth-eaten, If ye take well therewith, It hath in it some pith. The tumbling, broken, and comically grotesque octosyllabic couplet, often using double, triple, and imperfect rhymes, developed by Samuel Butler for his satiric poem Hudibras (1663-78) is a form of deliberate doggerel that has come to be called Hudibrastic verse: Besides, he was a shrewd philosopher, And had read every text and gloss over; Whate'er the crabbed'st author hath, He understood b'implicit faith. See meter. Drama. The form of composition designed for performance in the theater, in which actors take the roles of the characters, perform the indicated action, and utter the written dialogue. (The common alternative name for a dramatic composition is a play.) In poetic drama the dialogue is written in verse, which in English is usually blank verse and in French is the twelve-syllable line called an Alexandrine; almost all the heroic dramas of the English Restoration Period, however, were written in heroic couplets (iambic pentameter lines rhyming in pairs). A closet drama is written in dramatic form, with dialogue, 70 DRAMATIC MONOLOGUE indicated settings, and stage directions, but is intended by the author to be read rather than to be performed; examples are Dynasts (1904-8). For types of plays, and their component elements, see the Index of Terms under drama. Dramatic Monologue. A monologue is a lengthy speech by a single per\u00ad son. In a play, when a character utters a monologue that expresses his or her private thoughts, it is called a soliloquy. Dramatic monologue, however, does not designate a component in a play, but a type of lyr\u00ecc poem that was per\u00ad fected by Robert Browning. In its fullest form, as represented in Browning's \"My Last Duchess,\" \"The Bishop Orders His Tomb,\" \"Andrea del Sarto,\" and many other poems, the dramatic monologue has the following features: (1) A single person, who is patently not the poet, utters the speech that makes up the whole of the poem, in a specific situation at a critical moment: the Duke is negotiating with an emissary for a second wife; the Bishop lies dying; An\u00ad drea once more attempts wistfully to believe his wife's lies. (2) This person ad\u00ad dresses and interacts with one or more other people; but we know of the auditors' presence, and what they say and do, only from clues in the discourse of the single speaker. (3) The main principle controlling the poet's formula\u00ad tion of what the lyric speaker says is to reveal to the reader, in a way that en\u00ad hances its interest, the speaker's temperament and character. In monologues such as \"Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister\" and \"Caliban upon Setebos,\" Browning omits the second feature, the presence of a silent auditor; but features (1) and (3) are the necessary conditions of a dramatic monologue. The third feature\u2014the focus on self-revelation\u2014serves to distin\u00ad guish a dramatic monologue from its near relation, the dramatic lyric, which is also a monologue uttered in an identifiable situation at a dramatic moment. John Donne's \"The Canonization\" and \"The Flea\" (1613), for example, are dramatic lyrics that lack only one feature of the dramatic monologue: the focus of interest is primarily on the speaker's elaborately ingenious argument, rather than on the character he inadvertently reveals in the course of arguing. And although Wordsworth's \"Tintern Abbey\" (1798) is spoken by one person to a silent auditor (his sister) in a specific situation at a significant moment in his life, it is not a dramatic monologue proper, both because we are invited to identify the speaker with the poet himself, and because the organizing princi\u00ad ple and focus of interest is not the revelation of the speaker's distinctive tem\u00ad perament, but the evolution of his observations, memories, and thoughts toward the resolution of an emotional problem. Tennyson wrote \"Ulysses\" (1842) and other dramatic monologues, and the form has been used by H. D. (Hilda Doolittle), Amy Lowell, Robert Frost, E. A. Robinson, Ezra Pound, Robert Lowell, and other poets of this century. The best-known modern instance is T. S. Eliot's \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" (1915). DREAM VISION \u00b7 EDITION 71 See Benjamin Fuson, Browning and His English Predecessors in the Dramatic Monologue (1948); Robert Langbaum, The Poetry of Experience: The Dra\u00ad matic Monologue in Modern Literary Tradition (1957); Ralph W. Rader, \"The Dra\u00ad matic Monologue and Related Lyric Forms,\" Critical Inquiry 3 (1976); and Adena Rosmarin, The Power of Genre (1985, chapter 2, \"The Dramatic Monologue\"). Dream Vision (also called dream allegory) is a mode of narrative widely employed by medieval poets: the narrator falls asleep, usually in a spring landscape, and dreams the events he goes on to relate; often he is led by a guide, human or animal, and the events which he dreams are at least in part an allegory. A very influential medieval example is the thirteenth-century French poem Roman de la Rose; the greatest of medieval poems, Dante's Divine Comedy, is also a dream vision. In fourteenth-century England, it is the narra\u00ad tive mode of the fine elegy The Pearl, of Langland's Piers Plowman, and of Chaucer's The Book of the Duchess and The House of Fame. After the Middle Ages the vogue of the dream allegory diminished, but it never died out, as Bunyan's prose narrative The Pilgrim's Progress (1678) and Keats' verse narra\u00ad tive The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream (1819) bear witness. Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) is in the form of a dream vision, and James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (1939) consists of an immense cosmic dream on the part of an archetypal dreamer. See C. S. Lewis, The Allegory of Love (1938); and Howard Rollin Patch, The Other World according to Descriptions in Medieval Literature (1950, reprinted 1970). Edition in present usage designates the total copies of a book that are printed from a single setting of type or other mode of reproduction. The vari\u00ad ous \"printings\" or \"reprints\" of an edition\u2014sometimes with some minor changes in the text\u2014may be spaced over a period of years. We now identify as a \"new edition\" a printing in which substantial changes have been made in the text. A text may be revised and reprinted in this way many times, hence the terms \"second edition,\" \"third edition,\" etc. A variorum edition designates either (1) an edition of a work that lists all the textual variants in an author's manuscripts and revisions of the printed text; an example is The Variorum Edition of the Poems ofW. B. Yeats, eds. Peter Allt and Russell K. Alspach (1957); or else (2) an edition of a text that includes a selection of annotations and commentaries on the text by previous editors and critics. The term \"variorum\" is a short form of the Latin cum notis vari\u00ad orum: \"with the annotations of various persons.\" The New Variorum Edition of Shakespeare, still in process, is a variorum edition in both senses of the word. The term incunabula (the singular is \"incunabulum\") signifies all books that were produced in the infancy of printing. (The word \"incunabula\" is Latin for \"swaddling clothes.\") The terminal date is 1500, about fifty years after the German printer Johann Gutenberg invented movable printing type.

Elegy. In Greek and Roman literature, \"elegy\" denoted any poem written in elegiac meter (alternating hexameter ana pentameter lines). The term was also used, however, to refer to the subject matter of change and loss frequently ex\u00ad pressed in the elegiac verse form, especially in complaints about love. In ac\u00ad cordance with this latter usage, \"The Wanderer,\" \"The Seafarer,\" and other poems in Old English on the transience of all worldly things are even now called elegies. In Europe and England the word continued to have a variable application through the Renaissance. John Donne's elegies, written in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, are love poems, although they re\u00ad late to the sense of elegy as lament, in that many of them emphasize mutabil\u00ad ity and loss. In the seventeenth century the term elegy began to be limited to its most common present usage: a formal and sustained lament in verse for the death of a particular person, usually ending in a consolation. Examples are the medieval poem The Pearl and Chaucer's Book of the Duchess (elegies in the mode of dream allegory); Alfred, Lord Tennyson's In Memoriam (1850), on the death of Arthur Hallam; and W. H. Auden's \"In Memory of W. B. Yeats\" (1940). Occasionally the term is used in its older and broader sense, for somber meditations on mortality such as Thomas Gray's \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\" (1757), and the Duino Elegies (1912-22) of the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke on the transience both of poets and of the earthly ob\u00ad jects they write poems about. The dirge is also a versified expression of grief on the occasion of a par\u00ad ticular person's death, but differs from the elegy in that it is short, is less for\u00ad mal, and is usually represented as a text to be sung; examples are Shakespeare's \"Full Fathom Five Thy Father Song from Shakespeare's Cymbeline\" (1749). Threnody is now used mainly as an equivalent for \"dirge,\" and monody for an elegy or dirge which is pre\u00ad sented as the utterance of a single person. John Milton describes his \"Lycidas\" (1638) in the subtitle as a \"monody\" in which \"the Author bewails a learned Friend,\" and Matthew Arnold called his elegy on A. H. Clo\u00f9gh \"Thyrsis: A Monody\" (1866). An important subtype of the elegy is the pastoral elegy, which represents both the poet and the one he mourns\u2014who is usually also a poet\u2014as shep\u00ad herds (the Latin word for shepherd is \"pastor\"). This poetic form was origi\u00ad nated by the Sicilian Greek poet Theocritus, was continued by the Roman Virgil, was developed in various European countries during the Renaissance, and remained current in English poetry throughout the nineteenth century. Notable English pastoral elegies are Spenser's \"Astrophel,\" on the death \"Lycidas\" (1638), Arnold's \"Thyrsis.\" The pastoral elegists, from the Greeks through the Renaissance, developed a set of elaborate conven\u00ad tions, which are illustrated here by reference to \"Lycidas.\" In addition to the ELEGY fictional representation of both mourner and subject as shepherds tending their flocks (lines 23-36 and elsewhere), we often find the following conven\u00ad tional features: (1) The lyric speaker begins by invoking the muses, and goes on to make frequent reference to other figures from classical mythology (lines 15-22, and later). (2) All nature joins in mourning the shepherd's death (lines 37-49). (Re\u00ad cent critics who stress the mythic and ritual origins of poetic genres claim that this feature is a survival from primitive laments for the death of Thammuz, Adonis, or other vegetational deities who died in the autumn to be reborn in the spring. See myth critics.) (3) The mourner charges with negligence the nymphs or other guardians of the dead shepherd (lines 50-63). (4) There is a procession of appropriate mourners (lines 88-111). (5) The poet raises questions about the justice of fate, or else of Provi\u00ad dence, and adverts to the corrupt conditions of his own times (lines 64-84, 113-31). Such passages, though sometimes called \"digres\u00ad sions,\" are integral to the evolution of the mourner's thought in \"Ly- cidas.\" (6) Post-Renaissance elegies often include an elaborate passage in which appropriate flowers are brought to deck the hearse (lines 133-51). (7) There is a closing consolation. In Christian elegies, the lyric reversal from grief and despair to joy and assurance typically occurs when the elegist suddenly realizes that death in this world is the entry to a higher life (lines 165-85). In his Life of Milton (1779) Samuel Johnson, who disapproved both of pastoralism and mythology in modern poetry, decried \"Lycidas\" for \"its in\u00ad herent improbability,\" but in the elegies by Milton and other major poets the ancient rituals provide a structural frame on which they play variations with originality and power. Some of the pastoral conventions, although adapted to an industrial age and a non-Christian worldview, survive still in Walt Whitman's elegy on Lincoln, \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" (1866). In the last two decades of the twentieth century there has been a strong revival of the elegy, especially in America, to mourn the devastation and death wrought by AIDS among talented young intellectuals, poets, and artists; see Michael Klein, ed., Poets for Life: Seventy-six Poets Respond to AIDS (1989). See conventions and pastoral. On the elegy, refer to: Mary Lloyd, Elegies, Ancient and Modern (1903); T. P. Harrison, Jr., and H. J. Leon, eds., The Pastoral Elegy: An Anthology (1939); Peter Sacks, The English Elegy: Studies in the Genre from Spenser to Yeats (1985). On \"Lycidas\": C. A. Patrides, ed., Milton's \"Lyci\u00ad das\": The Tradition and the Poem (rev., 1983), which includes a number of re\u00ad cent critical essays; and Scott Elledge, ed., Milton's \"Lycidas\" (1966), which reprints classical and Renaissance pastoral elegies and other texts as back\u00ad ground to Milton's poem. 74 EMPATHY AND SYMPATHY Empathy and Sympathy. German theorists in the nineteenth century de\u00ad veloped the concept of \"Einf\u00fchlung\" (\"feeling into\"), which has been trans\u00ad lated as empathy. It signifies an identification of oneself with an observed person or object which is so close that one seems to participate in the pos\u00ad ture, motion, and sensations that one observes. Empathy is often described as \"an involuntary projection of ourselves into an object,\" and is commonly explained as the result of an \"inner mimicry\"; that is, the observation of an object evokes incipient muscular movements which are not experienced as one's own sensations, but as though they were attributes of the outer object. The object may be human, or nonhuman, or even inanimate. In thoroughly absorbed contemplation we seem empathically to pirouette with a ballet dancer, soar with a hawk, bend with the movements of a tree in the wind, and even share the strength, ease, and grace with which a well-proportioned arch appears to support a bridge. When John Keats said that he becomes \"a part of all I see,\" and that \"if a sparrow comes before my window I take part in its existence and pick about the gravel,\" he was describing an habitual ex\u00ad perience of his intensely empathie temperament, long before the word was coined. In literature we call \"empathie\" a passage which conspicuously evokes from the reader this sense of participation with the pose, movements, and physical sensations of the object that the passage describes. An example is Shakespeare's description, in his narrative poem Venus and Adonis (1593), of the snail, whose tender horns being hit, Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain. Another is the description of the motion of a wave in Keats' Endymion (1818), when heav'd anew Old ocean rolls a lengthen'd wave to the shore, Down whose green back the short-liv'd foam, all hoar, Bursts gradual, with a wayward indolence. Also empathie is the description of a wave\u2014experienced from the point of view of Penelope awaiting the long-delayed return of her husband Odysseus\u2014 by H. D. (Hilda Doolittle), in her poem, \"At Ithica\": Over and back, the long waves crawl and track the sand with foam; night darkens and the sea takes on that desperate tone of dark that wives put on when all their love is done. Sympathy, as distinguished from empathy, denotes fellow-feeling; that is, not feeling-into the physical state and sensations, but feeling-along-with the mental state and emotions, of another human being, or of nonhuman be\u00ad ings to whom we attribute human emotions. (See personification.) We \"sympa\u00ad thize,\" for example, with the emotional experience of a child in his first attempt to recite a piece in public; we may also \"empathize\" as he falters in ENLIGHTENMENT 75 his speaking or makes an awkward gesture. Robert Burns' \"To a Mouse\" (1786) is an engaging expression of his quick sympathy with the terror of the \"wee, sleekit, cow'rin, tim'rous beastie\" whose nest he has turned up with his plow. The engagement and control of a reader's sympathy with certain charac\u00ad ters, and the establishment of antipathy toward others, is essential to the tra\u00ad ditional literary artist. In King Lear, Shakespeare undertakes to make us sympathize with Cordelia, for example, and progressively with King Lear, but to make us feel horror and antipathy toward his \"pelican daughters,\" Goneril and Regan. Our attitude in the same play toward the villainous Edmund the bastard son of Gloucester, as managed by Shakespeare, is complex\u2014antipa\u00ad thetic, yet with some element of sympathetic understanding of his distorted personality. (See distance and involvement) Bertolt Brecht's alienation effect was designed to inhibit the sympathy of an audience with the protagonists of his plays, in order to encourage a critical attitude to the actions and social reali\u00ad ties that the plays represent. A number of recent critical theorists stress the need to read against one's acquiescence to the sympathetic identification intended by an author. Such feminist critics as Judith Fetterley, for example, in The Resisting Reader (1978), propose that women should learn to read in opposition to the sympathy with male protagonists, and the derogation of women characters, that is written into the work of many male authors. (See under feminist criticism.) And a ten\u00ad dency in the new historicism, as well as in postcolonial criticism, is to recom\u00ad mend that the reader, even if against an author's intention, shift his or her sympathy from the dominant to the subversive characters in a literary work\u2014 from the magus Prospero, for example, in Shakespeare's The Tempest, to his brutish and rebellious slave Caliban, who is taken to represent the natives of the New World who are oppressed and enslaved by English and European in\u00ad vaders. (Some current critics claim that, whatever Shakespeare's intentions, Caliban, as he is represented, is sympathetic, and that Prospero, as he is repre\u00ad sented, is not; also that the admiration for Prospero in the nineteenth century depended on a willful evasion of aspects of the play.) Refer to H. S. Langfeld, The Aesthetic Attitude (1920)\u2014the section on em\u00ad pathy is reprinted in Problems of Aesthetics (1963), ed. Eliseo Vivas and Murray Krieger. For detailed analyses of empathie passages in literature, see Richard H. Fogle, The Imagery of Keats and Shelley (1949), chapter 4. Enlightenment. The name applied to an intellectual movement and cul\u00ad tural ambiance which developed in western Europe during the seventeenth century and reached its height in the eighteenth. The common element was a trust in human reason as adequate to solve the crucial problems and to estab\u00ad lish the essential norms in life, together with the belief that the application of reason was rapidly dissipating the darkness of superstition, prejudice, and bar\u00ad barity, was freeing humanity from its earlier reliance on mere authority and unexamined tradition, and had opened the prospect of progress toward a life in this world of universal peace and happiness. (See the idea of progress.) For some thinkers the model for \"reason\" was the inductive procedure of science, 76 EPIC which proceeds by reasoning from the facts of experience to general laws; for others (especially Descartes and his followers), the model for \"reason\" was pri\u00ad marily geometrical\u2014the deduction of particular truths from clear and distinct ideas which are known intuitively, by \"the light of reason.\" Many thinkers re\u00ad lied on reason in both these senses. In England the thought and the world outlook of the Enlightenment are usually traced from Francis Bacon (1561-1626) through John Locke (1632-1704) to late-eighteenth-century thinkers such as William Godwin; in France, from Descartes (1596-1650) through Voltaire (1694-1778) to and Encyclop\u00e9die (1751-72); in Ger\u00ad many, from Leibniz (1646-1716) to what is often said to be the highest prod\u00ad uct of the Enlightenment, the \"critical philosophy\" of Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). Kant's famous essay Enlightenment?\" written in 1784, defines it as \"the liberation of mankind from his self-caused state of minority\" and the achievement of a state of maturity which is exemplified in his \"deter\u00ad mination and courage to use [his understanding] without the assistance of an\u00ad other.\" In America, Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson represented the principles of the French and English Enlightenment, which also helped shape the founding documents of the United States, the Declaration of Indepen\u00ad dence and the Constitution. See neoclassicism and romanticism; and refer to Ernst Cassirer, The Philoso\u00ad phy of the Enlightenment (1932); A. O. Lovejoy, Essays in the History of Ideas (1948); Basil Willey, The Eighteenth Century Background (1950); Peter Gay, The Enlightenment: An Interpretation (1966). Epic. In its strict sense the term epic or heroic poem is applied to a work that meets at least the following criteria: it is a long verse narrative on a seri\u00ad ous subject, told in a formal and elevated style, and centered on a heroic or quasi-divine figure on whose actions depends the fate of a tribe, a nation, or (in the instance of John Milton's Paradise Lost) the human race. There is a standard distinction between traditional and literary epics. Tra\u00ad ditional epics (also called \"folk epics\" or \"primary epics\") were written versions of what had originally been oral poems about a tribal or national hero during a warlike age. (See oral formulaic poetry.) Among these are the Iliad and Odyssey that the Greeks ascribed to Homer; the Anglo-Saxon Beowulf; the French Chan\u00ad son de Roland and the Spanish Poema del Cid in the twelfth century; and the thirteenth-century German epic Nibelungenlied. \"Literary epics\" were com\u00ad posed by individual poetic craftsmen in deliberate imitation of the traditional form. Of this kind is Virgil's Latin poem the Aeneid, which later served as the chief model for Milton's literary epic Paradise Lost (1667). Paradise Lost in turn became, in the Romantic Period, a model for John Keats' fragmentary epic Hy\u00ad perion, as well as for several epics, or \"prophetic books\" (The Four Zoas, Milton, Jerusalem), which translated into Blake's own mythic terms the biblical narrative that had been Milton's subject. In his Anatomy of Criticism (1957) Northrop Frye asserts that Homer es\u00ad tablished for his successors the \"demonstration that the fall of an enemy, no EPIC less than of a friend or leader, is tragic and not comic,\" and that with this \"ob\u00ad jective and disinterested element,\" the epic acquired an authority based \"on the vision of nature as an impersonal order.\" The epic was ranked by Aristotle as second only to tragedy, and by many Renaissance critics as the highest of all genres. The literary epic is certainly the most ambitious of poetic enter\u00ad prises, making immense demands on a poet's knowledge, invention, and skill to sustain the scope, grandeur, and authority of a poem that tends to encom\u00ad pass the world of its day and a large portion of its learning. Despite numerous attempts in many languages over nearly three thousand years, we possess no more than a half-dozen such poems of indubitable greatness. Literary epics are highly conventional compositions which usually share the following fea\u00ad tures, derived by way of the Aeneid from the traditional epics of Homer: (1) The hero is a figure of great national or even cosmic importance. In the Iliad he is the Greek warrior Achilles, who is the son of the sea- nymph Thetis; and Virgil's Aeneas is the son of the goddess Aphrodite. In Paradise Lost, Adam and Eve are the progenitors of the entire human race, or if we regard Christ as the protagonist, He is both God and man. Blake's primal figure is \"the Universal Man\" Al\u00ad bion, who incorporates, before his fall, humanity and God and the cosmos as well. (2) The setting of the poem is ample in scale, and may be worldwide, or even larger. Odysseus wanders over the Mediterranean basin (the whole of the world known at the time), and in Book XI he descends into the under world (as does Virgil's Aeneas). The scope of Paradise Lost is the entire universe, for it takes place in heaven, on earth, in hell, and in the cosmic space between. (See Ptolemaic universe.) (3) The action involves superhuman deeds in battle, such as Achilles' feats in the Trojan War, or a long, arduous, and dangerous journey in\u00ad trepidly accomplished, such as the wanderings of Odysseus on his way back to his homeland, in the face of opposition by some of the gods. Paradise Lost includes the revolt in heaven by the rebel angels against God, the journey of Satan through chaos to discover the newly created world, and his desperately audacious attempt to outwit God by corrupting mankind, in which his success is ultimately frus\u00ad trated by the sacrificial action of Christ. (4) In these great actions the gods and other supernatural beings take an interest or an active part\u2014the Olympian gods in Homer, and Jeho\u00ad vah, Christ, and the angels in Paradise Lost. These supernatural agents were in the Neoclassic Age called the machinery, in the sense that they were part of the literary contrivances of the epic. (5) An epic poem is a ceremonial performance, and is narrated in a cere\u00ad monial style which is deliberately distanced from ordinary speech and proportioned to the grandeur and formality of the heroic subject and architecture. Hence Milton's grand style\u2014his formal diction and elab\u00ad orate and stylized syntax, which are often modeled on Latin poetry, 78 EPIC his sonorous lists of names and wide-ranging allusions, and his imita\u00ad tion of Homer's epic similes and epithets. There are also widely used epic conventions, or formulas, in the choice and ordering of episodes in the heroic plot; prominent among them are these fea\u00ad tures, as exemplified in Paradise Lost: (1) The narrator begins by stating his argument, or epic theme, invokes a muse or guiding spirit to inspire him in his great undertaking, then addresses to the muse the epic question, the answer to which inau\u00ad gurates the narrative proper (Paradise Lost, I. 1-49). (2) The narrative starts in medias res (\"in the middle of things\"), at a critical point in the action. Paradise Lost opens with the fallen angels in hell, gathering their scattered forces and determining on revenge. Not until Books V-VII does the angel Raphael narrate to Adam the events in heaven which led to this situation; while in Books XI-XII, after the fall, Michael foretells to Adam future events up to Christ's second coming. Thus Milton's epic, although its action focuses on the temptation and fall of man, encompasses all time from the creation to the end of the world. (3) There are catalogues of some of the principal characters, introduced in formal detail, as in Milton's description of the procession of fallen angels in Book I of Paradise Lost. These characters are often given set speeches that reveal their diverse temperaments and moral attitudes; an example is the debate in Pandemonium, Book II. The term \"epic\" is often applied, by extension, to narratives which differ in many respects from this model but manifest the epic spirit and grandeur in the scale, the scope, and the profound human importance of their subjects. In this broad sense Dante's fourteenth-century Divine Comedy and Edmund Spenser's late-sixteenth-century The Faerie (1590-96) are often called epics, as are conspicuously large-scale and wide-ranging works of prose fiction such as Herman Melville's Moby-Dick (1851), Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace (1863-69), and James Joyce's Ulysses (1922); this last work achieves epic scope in representing the events of an ordinary day in Dublin (16 June 1904) by modeling them on the episodes of Homer's Odyssey. In a still more extended application, the Marxist critic Georg Luk\u00e1cs used the term bourgeois epic for all novels which, in his view, reflect the social reality of their capitalist age on a broad scale. In a famed sentence, Luk\u00e1cs said that \"the novel is the epic of a world that has been abandoned by God\" (Theory of the Novel, trans. Anna Bo- stock, 1971). See Luk\u00e1cs under Marxist criticism. See mock epic and refer to W. W. Lawrence, Beowulf and Epic Tradition (1928); C. M. Bowra, From Vergil to Milton (1945), and Heroic Poetry (1952); C. S. Lewis, A Preface to \"Paradise Lost\" (1942); Brian Wilkie, Romantic Poets and Epic Tradition Michael Murren, The Allegorical Epic (1980); Andrew Ford, Homer: The Poetry of the Past (1992); David Quint, Epic and Empire (1993). For an archetypal conception of the epic, see Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criti\u00ad cism (1957), pp. 315-26. EPIC EPIGRAM 79 Epic Similes are formal, sustained similes in which the secondary subject, or vehicle, is elaborated far beyond its specific points of close parallel to the primary subject, or tenor, to which it is compared (see under figurative lan\u00ad guage). This figure was imitated from Homer by Virgil, Milton, and other writ\u00ad ers of literary epics, who employed it to enhance the ceremonial quality and wide-ranging reference of the narrative style. In the epic simile in Paradise Lost (I. 768 ff.), Milton describes his primary subject, the fallen angels thronging toward their new-built palace of Pandemonium, by an elaborate comparison to the swarming of bees: As Bees In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides, Pour forth their populous youth about the Hive In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank, The suburb of their Straw-built Citadel, New rubb'd with Balm, expatiate and confer Their State affairs. So thick the aery crowd Swarm'd and were strait'n'd;. .. Epic Theater. The term that the German playwright Bertolt Brecht, in the 1920s, applied to his plays. By the word \"epic,\" Brecht signified primarily his attempt to emulate on the stage the objectivity of the narration in Homeric epic. By employing a detached narrator and other devices to achieve alienation effects, Brecht aimed to subvert the sympathy of the audience with the actors, and the identification of the actor with his role, that were features of the the\u00ad ater of bourgeois realism. His hope was to encourage his audience to criticize and oppose, rather than passively to accept, the social conditions and modes of behavior that the plays represent. Brecht's dramatic works continue to be produced frequently, and his epic theater has had important influence on such playwrights as Edward Bond and Caryl Churchill in England and Tony Kushner in America. See Bertolt Brecht under Marxist criticism, and refer to John Willett, ed., Brecht on Theatre: The Development of an Aesthetic (1964); and Janelle Reinelt, After Brecht: British Epic Theater (1994). Epigram. The term is now used for a statement, whether in verse or prose, which is terse, pointed, and witty. The epigram may be on any subject, ama\u00ad tory, elegiac, meditative, complimentary, anecdotal, or (most often) satiric. Martial, the Roman epigrammatist, established the enduring model for the caustically satiric epigram in verse. The verse epigram was much cultivated in England in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by such poets as John Donne, Ben Jonson, and Robert Herrick. The form flourished especially in the eighteenth century, the time that Austin Dobson described as the age \"of wit, of polish, and of Pope.\" Matthew Prior is a highly accomplished writer of epigrams, and many closed couplets by Alexander Pope and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu are detachable 80 EPIPHANY epigrams. In the same century, when the exiled Stuarts were still pretenders to the English throne, John Byrom proposed this epigrammatic toast: God bless the King\u2014I mean the Faith's defender! God bless (no harm in blessing) the Pretender! But who pretender is or who is king\u2014 God bless us all! that's quite another thing. And here is one of Samuel Taylor Coleridge's epigrams, to show that Ro\u00ad manticism did not preclude wit: On a Volunteer Singer Swans sing before they die\u2014'twere no bad thing Should certain people die before they sing! Many of the short poems of Walter Savage Landor (1775-1864) were fine examples of the nonsatirical epigram. Boileau and Voltaire excelled in the epi\u00ad gram France, as did Lessing, Goethe, and Schiller in Germany; and in Amer\u00ad ica, a number of the short poems by R. W. Emerson and Emily Dickinson may be accounted epigrams. The form has continued to be cultivated by Robert Frost, Ezra Pound, Ogden Nash, Phyllis McGinley, Dorothy Parker, A. R. Am\u00ad nions, Richard Wilbur, John Hollander, and other poets in the present century. \"Epigram\" came to be applied, after the eighteenth century, to neat and witty statements in prose as well as verse; an alternative name for the prose epigram is the apothegm. (For the analysis of examples, see wit, humor, and the comic.) Such terse and witty prose statements are to be distinguished from the aphorism: a pithy and pointed statement of a serious maxim, opinion, or general truth. One of the best known of aphorisms is also one of the shortest: ars longa, vita brevis est\u2014\"art is long, life is short.\" It occurs first in a work at\u00ad tributed to the Greek physician Hippocrates entitled Aphorisms, which con\u00ad sisted of tersely worded precepts on the practice of medicine. (See John Gross, ed. The Oxford Book of Aphorisms, 1983.) Refer to T. K. Whipple, Martial and the English Epigram (1925); E. B. Osborn, ed., The Hundred Best Epigrams (1928); Kingsley Amis, ed., The New Oxford Book of Light Verse (1978); Russell Baker, ed., The Norton Book of Light Verse (1986). Epiphany means \"a manifestation,\" or \"showing forth,\" and by Christian thinkers was used to signify a manifestation of God's presence within the cre\u00ad ated world. In the early draft of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man entitled Stephen Hero (published posthumously in 1944), James Joyce adapted the term to secular experience, to signify a sudden sense of radiance and revelation that one may feel while perceiving a commonplace object. \"By an epiphany [Stephen] meant a sudden spiritual manifestation.\" \"Its soul, its whatness, leaps to us from the vestment of its appearance. The soul of the commonest object. . . seems to us radiant. The object achieves its epiphany.\" Joyce's short stories and novels include a number of epiphanies; a climactic one is the rev\u00ad elation that Stephen experiences at the sight of the young girl wading on the shore of the sea in A Portrait of the Artist, chapter 4. EPITHALAMION 81 \"Epiphany\" has become the standard term for the description, frequent in modern poetry and prose fiction, of the sudden flare into revelation of an ordinary object or scene. Joyce, however, had merely substituted this word for what earlier authors had called the moment. Thus Shelley, in his Defense of Poetry (1821), described the \"best and happiest moments . .. arising unfore\u00ad seen and departing unbidden,\" \"visitations of divinity,\" which poetry \"re\u00ad deems from decay.\" William Wordsworth was a pre-eminent poet of what he called \"moments,\" or in more elaborate cases, \"spots of time.\" For examples of short poems which represent a moment of revelation, see Wordsworth's \"The Two April Mornings\" and \"The Solitary Reaper.\" Wordsworth's Prelude, like some of Joyce's narratives, is constructed as a sequence of such visionary encounters. Thus in Book VIII, lines 543-54 (1850 ed.), Wordsworth describes the \"moment\" when he for the first time passed in a stagecoach over the \"threshold\" of London and the \"trivial forms / Of houses, pavement, streets\" suddenly assumed a profound power and significance: 'twas a moment's pause,\u2014 All that took place within me came and went As in a moment; yet with Time it dwells, And grateful memory, as a thing divine. See Irene H. Chayes, \"Joyce's Epiphanies,\" reprinted in Joyce's \"Portrait\": . . Connolly (1962); Morris Beja, Epiphany in the Modern Novel (1971); Ashton Nichols, The Poetics of Epiphany (1987). On the history of the traditional \"moment\" in sacred and secular writings beginning with St. Augustine, and its conversion into the modern literary epiphany, see M. H. Abrams, Natural Supematuralism: Tradition and Revolution in Romantic Literature (1971), chapters 7-8. Epithalamion, or in the Latin form \"epithalamium,\" is a poem written to celebrate a marriage. Among its classical practitioners were the Greeks Sappho and Theocritus and the Romans Ovid and Catullus. The term in Greek means \"at the bridal chamber,\" since the verses were originally written to be sung outside the bedroom of a newly married couple. The form flourished among the Neo-Latin poets of the Renaissance, who established the model that was followed by writers in the European vernacular languages. Sir Philip Sidney wrote the first English instance in about 1580, and fifteen years later Edmund Spenser wrote his great lyric \"Epithalamion,\" a celebration of his own mar\u00ad riage that he composed as a wedding gift to his bride. Spenser's poem follows, in elaborately contrived numbers of stanzas and lines, the sequence of the hours during his wedding day and night and combines, with unfailing grace and dignity, Christian ritual and beliefs, pagan topics and mythology, and the local Irish setting. John Donne, Ben Jonson, Robert Herrick, and many other Renaissance poets composed wedding poems that were solemn or rib\u00ad ald, according to the intended audience and the poet's own temperament. Sir John Suckling's \"A Ballad upon a Wedding\" is a good-humored parody of this upper-class poetic form, which he applies to a lower-class wedding. The 82 EPITHET \u00b7 ESSAY tradition persists. Shelley composed an \"Epithalamium\"; Tennyson's In Memo- nam, although it opens with a funeral, closes with an epithalamion; A. E. Housman spoke in the antique idiom of the bridal song in \"He Is Here, Ura\u00ad nia's Son\"; and W. H. Auden wrote an \"Epithalamion\" in 1939. See Robert H. Case, English Epithalamies (1896); Virginia J. Tufte, The Po\u00ad etry of Marriage (1970); and (on the elaborate construction of the stanzas and lines in Spenser's \"Epithalamion\" to correspond with the passage of time on his wedding day) A. Kent Hieatt, Short Time's Endless Monument (1960). Epithet. As a term in criticism, epithet denotes an adjective or adjectival phrase used to define a distinctive quality of a person or thing; an example is John Keats, \"silver snarling trumpets\" in The Eve of St. Agnes. The term is also applied to an identifying phrase that stands in place of a noun; thus Alexan\u00ad der Pope's \"the glittering forfex\" is an ironically inflated epithet for the scissors with which the Baron performs his heinous act in The Rape of the Lock (1714). The frequent use of derogatory adjectives and phrases in invective has led to the mistaken notion that an \"epithet\" is always uncomplimentary. Homeric epithets are adjectival terms\u2014usually a compound of two words\u2014like those which Homer in his epic poems used as recurrent formulas in referring to a distinctive feature of someone or in his to \"the snot-green sea.\" We often use \"conventional epithets\" in identifying historical or legendary figures, as in Charles the Great, Lorenzo the Magnificent, Patient Griselda. Essay. Any short composition in prose that undertakes to discuss a matter, express a point of view, persuade us to accept a thesis on any subject, or sim\u00ad ply entertain. The essay differs from a \"treatise\" or \"dissertation\" in its lack of pretension to be a systematic and complete exposition, and in being ad\u00ad dressed to a general rather than a specialized audience; as a consequence, the essay discusses its subject in nontechnical fashion, and often with a liberal use of such devices as anecdote, striking illustration, and humor to augment its appeal. A useful distinction is that between the formal and informal essay. The formal essay, or article, is relatively impersonal: the author writes as an au\u00ad thority, or at least as highly knowledgeable, and expounds the subject in an orderly way. Examples will be found in various scholarly journals, as well as among the serious articles on current topics and issues in any of the maga\u00ad zines addressed to a thoughtful audience\u2014Harper's, Commentary, Scientific American, and so on. In the informal essay (or \"familiar\" or \"personal essay\"), the author assumes a tone of intimacy with his audience, tends to deal with everyday things rather than with public affairs or specialized topics, and writes in a relaxed, self-revelatory, and sometimes whimsical fashion. Accessi\u00ad ble modern examples are to be found in any issue of The New Yorker. The Greeks Theophrastus and Plutarch and the Romans Cicero and Seneca wrote essays long before the genre was given what became its standard EUPHEMISM \u00b7 EUPHONY AND CACOPHONY 83 name by Montaigne's French Essais in 1580. The title signifies \"attempts\" and was meant to indicate the tentative and unsystematic nature of Montaigne's commentary on topics such as \"Of Illness\" and \"Of Sleeping,\" in contrast to formal and technical treatises on the same subjects. Francis Bacon, late in the sixteenth century, inaugurated the English use of the term in his own Essays; most of them are short discussions such as \"Of Truth,\" \"Of Adversity,\" \"Of Marriage and the Single Life.\" Alexander Pope adopted the term for his expos\u00ad itory compositions in verse, the Essay on Criticism (1711) and the Essay on Man (1733), but the verse essay has had few important exponents after the eigh\u00ad teenth century. In the early eighteenth century Joseph Addison and Sir Richard Steele's Tatler and Spectator, with their many successors, gave to the essay written in prose its standard modern vehicle, the literary periodical (ear\u00ad lier essays had been published in books). In the early nineteenth century the founding of new types of magazines, and their steady proliferation, gave great impetus to the writing of essays and made them a major department of literature. This was the age when William Hazlitt, Thomas De Quincey, Charles Lamb, and, later in the century, Robert Louis Stevenson brought the English essay\u2014and especially the personal essay\u2014to a level that has not been surpassed. Major American essayists in the nineteenth century include Washington Irving, Emerson, Thoreau, James Russell Lowell, and Mark Twain. In our own era the many periodicals pour out scores of essays every week. Most of them are formal in type; Virginia Woolf, George Orwell, E. M. Forster, James Thurber, E. B. White, James Bald\u00ad win, Joan Didion, Susan Sontag, and Toni Morrison, however, are notable twentieth-century practitioners of the informal essay. See Hugh Walker, The English Essay and Essayists (1915, reprinted 1923); Robert Scholes and Carl H. Klaus, Elements of the Essay (1969); John Gross, ed., The Oxford Book of Essays (1991); Wendy Martin, ed., Essays by Contemporary Amer\u00edcan Women (1996). W. F. Bryan and R. S. Crane, eds., The English Familiar Essay (1916), has an informative historical introduction to this literary form. Euphemism. An inoffensive expression used in place of a blunt one that is felt to be disagreeable or embarrassing. Euphemisms are used frequently with reference to such subjects as religion (\"Gosh darn!\" for \"God damn!\"), instead \"toilet\"), and sex (\"to sleep with\" instead of \"to have sexual intercourse with\"). On the extraordinary number and variety of sexual euphemisms in Shakespeare's plays, see Eric Partridge, Shakespeare's Bawdy (1960). Euphony and Cacophony. Euphony is a term applied to language which strikes the ear as smooth, pleasant, and musical, as in these lines from John Keats, The Eve of St Agnes (1820), And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon; Manna and dates, in argosy Fez; and spic\u00e8d dainties, every one, From silken Samarcand to cedar'd Lebanon. 84 EUPHUISM Analysis of the passage, however, will show that what seems to be a purely au\u00ad ditory agreeableness is due more to the significance of the words, conjoined with the ease and pleasure of the physical act of enunciating the sequence of the speech-sounds, than to the inherent melodiousness of the speech-sounds themselves. The American critic John Crowe Ransom illustrated the impor\u00ad tance of significance to innumerable beeves\"; the euphony is destroyed, not by changing one speech sound and inserting others, but by the change in reference. Similarly, in cacophony, or dissonance\u2014language which is perceived as harsh, rough, and unmusical\u2014the discordancy is the effect not only of the sound of the words, but also of their significance, conjoined with the diffi\u00ad culty of enunciating the sequence of the speech-sounds. Cacophony may be inadvertent, through a lapse in the writer's attention or skill, as in the unfor\u00ad tunate line of Matthew Arnold's fine poem \"Dover Beach\" \"Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.\" But cacophony may also be deliberate and functional: for humor, as in Robert Browning's \"Pied Piper\" (1842), Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats... Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats; or else for other purposes, as in Thomas Hardy's attempt, in his poem \"In Tenebris I,\" to mimic, as well as describe, dogged endurance by the difficulty of enunciating the transition from each stressed monosyllable to the next: I shall not lose old strength In the lone frost's black length. Strength long since fled! For other sound effects see alliteration and onomatopoeia. Refer to G. R. Stewart, The Technique of English Verse (1930), and Northrop Frye, ed., Sound and Poetry (1957). Euphuism. A conspicuously formal and elaborate prose style which had a vogue in the 1580s in drama, prose fiction, and probably also in the conver\u00ad sation of English court circles. It takes its name from the moralistic prose ro\u00ad mance Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit, which John Lyly wrote in 1578. In the dialogues of this work and of Euphues and His England (1580), as well as in his stage comedies, Lyly exaggerated and used persistently a stylized prose which other writers had developed earlier. The style is sententious (that is, full of moral maxims), relies persistently on syntactical balance and antithesis, rein\u00ad forces the structural parallels by heavy and elaborate patterns of alliteration and assonance, exploits the rhetorical question, and is addicted to long similes and learned allusions which are often drawn from mythology and the habits of legendary animals. Here is a brief example from Euphues; the character Phi- lautus is speaking: EXPRESSIONISM 85 I see now that as the fish Scholopidus in the flood Araris at the waxing of the Moon is as white as the driven snow, and at the waning as black as the burnt coal, so Euphues, which at the first encreasing of our familiar\u00ad ity, was very zealous, is now at the last cast become most faithless. Shakespeare good-humoredly parodied this self-consciously elegant style in Love's Labour's Lost and other plays; nonetheless he, like other authors of the day, profited from Lyly's explorations of the formal and rhetorical possibilities of English prose. See style; also Jonas A. Barish, \"The Prose Style of John Lyly,\" English Lit\u00ad erary History 23 (1956), and G. K. Hunter, John Lyly (1962). Expressionism. A German movement in literature and the other arts (espe\u00ad cially the visual arts) which was at its height between 1910 and 1925\u2014that is, in the period just before, during, and after World War I. Its chief precursors were artists and writers who had in various ways departed from realistic de\u00ad pictions of life and the world, by incorporating in their art visionary or pow\u00ad erfully emotional states of mind that are expressed and transmitted by means of distorted representations of the outer world. Among these precursors in painting were Vincent Van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, and the Norwegian Edvard Munch\u2014Munch's lithograph The Cry (1894) depicting, against a bleak and stylized background, a tense figure with a contorted face uttering a scream of pure horror, is often taken to epitomize what became the expressionist mode. Prominent among the literary precursors of the movement in the nineteenth century were the French poets Charles Baudelaire and Arthur Rimbaud, the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky, the German philosopher Friedrich Niet\u00ad zsche, and above all the Swedish dramatist August Strindberg. Expressionism itself was never a concerted or well-defined movement. It can be said, however, that its central feature is a revolt against the artistic and literary tradition of realism, both in subject matter and in style. The expres\u00ad sionist artist or writer undertakes to express a personal vision\u2014usually a trou\u00ad bled or tensely emotional vision\u2014of human life and human society. This is done by exaggerating and distorting what, according to the norms of artistic realism, are objective features of the world, and by embodying violent ex\u00ad tremes of mood and feeling. Often the work implies that what is depicted or described represents the experience of an individual standing alone and afraid in an industrial, technological, and urban society which is disintegrating into chaos. Expressionists who were radical in their politics also projected Utopian views of a future community in a regenerate world. Expressionist painters tended to use jagged lines to depict contorted ob\u00ad jects and forms, as well as to substitute arbitrary, often lurid colors, for natural hues; among these painters were Emil Nolde, Franz Marc, Oskar Kokoschka, and, for a time, Wassily Kandinsky. Expressionist Ger\u00ad mans Gottfried Benn and Georg Trakl) departed from standard meter, syntax, and poetic structure to organize their works around symbolic images. Expres\u00ad sionist writers of prose narratives (most eminently Franz Kafka) abandoned 86 FABLIAU standard modes of characterization and plot for symbolic figures involved in an obsessive world of nightmarish events. Drama was a prominent and widely influential form of expressionist writ\u00ad ing. Among the better-known German playwrights were Georg Kaiser (Gas, From Morn to Midnight), Ernst Toller (Mass Man), and in his earlier productions Bertolt Brecht. Expressionist dramatists tended to represent anonymous human types instead of individualized characters, to replace plot by episodic renderings of intense and rapidly oscillating emotional states, often to fragment the dia\u00ad logue into exclamatory and seemingly incoherent sentences or phrases, and to employ masks and abstract or lopsided and sprawling stage sets. The producer Max Reinhardt, although not himself in the movement, directed a number of plays by Strindberg and by German expressionists; in them he inaugurated such modern devices as the revolving stage and special effects in lighting and sound. This mode of German drama had an important influence on the American the\u00ad ater. Eugene O'Neill's The Emperor Jones (1920) projected, in a sequence of sym\u00ad bolic episodes, the individual and racial memories of a terrified modern African-American protagonist, and Elmer Rice's The Adding Machine (1923) used nonrealistic means to represent a mechanical, sterile, and frightening world as experienced by Mr. Zero, a tiny and helpless cog in the impersonal system of big business. The flexible possibilities of the medium made the motion picture an important vehicle of German expressionism. Robert Wiene's early expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920)\u2014representing, in ominously distorted set\u00ad tings, the machinations of the satanic head of an insane asylum\u2014as well as Friedrich Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) and Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1926) are often shown in current revivals of films. Expressionism had begun to flag by 1925 and was finally suppressed in Germany by the Nazis in the early 1930s, but it has continued to exert influ\u00ad ence on English and American, as well as European, art and literature. We rec\u00ad ognize its effects, direct or indirect, on the writing and staging of such plays as Thornton Wilder's The Skin of Our Teeth and Arthur Miller's Death of a Sales\u00ad man, as well as on the theater of the absurd; on the poetry of Allen Ginsberg and other Beat writers; on the prose fiction of Samuel Beckett, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Joseph Heller, and Thomas Pynchon; and on a number of films, manifest\u00ad ing the distorted perceptions and fantasies of disturbed characters, by such di\u00ad rectors as Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, and Michelangelo Antonioni. See Richard Samuel and R. H. Thomas, Expressionism in German Life, Liter\u00ad ature and the Theater, 1910-1924 (1939); Walter H. Sokel, The Writer in Ex\u00ad tremis: Expressionism in Twentieth-Century German Literature (1959); John Willett, Expressionism (1970). On the expressionist cinema: Siegfried Kracauer, From Caligari to Hitler: A Psychological History of the German Film (1947); Lotte Eisner, The Haunted Screen: Expressionism in the German Cinema and the Influ\u00ad ence of Max Reinhardt (1969). Fabliau. The medieval fabliau was a short comic or satiric tale in verse deal\u00ad ing realistically with middle-class or lower-class characters and delighting in the ribald; its favorite theme is the cuckolding of a stupid husband. (Professor FANCY AND IMAGINATION 87 Douglas Bush neatly characterized the type as \"a short story broader than it is long.\") The fabliau flourished in France in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and became popular in England during the fourteenth century. Chaucer, who wrote one of the greatest serious short stories in verse, the ac\u00ad count of Death and the rioters in \"The Pardoner's Tale,\" also wrote one of the best fabliaux, the hilarious \"Miller's Tale.\" See Joseph B\u00e9dier, Les Fabliaux (5th ed., 1928); and Fabliaux: Ribald Tales from the Old French, trans. Robert Hellman and Richard O'Gorman (1976). Fancy and Imagination. The distinction between fancy and imagination was a key element in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's theory of poetry, as well as in his general theory of the mental processes. In earlier discussions, \"fancy\" and \"imagination\" had for the most part been used synonymously to denote a fac\u00ad ulty of the mind which is distinguished from \"reason,\" \"judgment,\" and \"mem\u00ad ory,\" in that it receives \"images\" that have been perceived by the senses and reorders them into new combinations. In the thirteenth chapter of Biographia Literaria (1817), Coleridge attributes this reordering function of the sensory im\u00ad ages to the lower faculty he calls fancy: \"Fancy... has no other counters to play with, but fixities and d\u00e9fin\u00eetes. The Fancy is indeed no other than a mode of Memory emancipated from the order of time and space.\" To Coleridge, that is, the fancy is a mechanical process which receives the elementary images\u2014the \"fixities and d\u00e9fin\u00eetes\" which come to it ready-made from the senses\u2014and, without altering the parts, reassembles them into a different spatial and tempo\u00ad ral order from that in which they were originally perceived. The imagination, however, which produces a much higher kind of poetry, dissolves, diffuses, dissipates, in order to re-create; or where this process is rendered impossible, yet still at all events it struggles to idealize and unify. It is essentially vital, even as all objects (as objects) are essentially fixed and dead. Coleridge's imagination, that is, is able to \"create\" rather than merely re\u00ad assemble, by dissolving the fixities and definites^-the mental pictures, or im\u00ad ages, received from the senses\u2014and unifying them into a new whole. And while the fancy is merely mechanical, the imagination is \"vital\"; that is, it is an organic faculty which operates not like a sorting machine, but like a living and growing plant. As Coleridge says elsewhere, the imagination \"generates and produces a form of its own,\" while its rules are \"the very powers of growth and production.\" And in the fourteenth chapter of the Biographia, Coleridge adds his famous statement that the \"synthetic\" power which is the \"imagina\u00ad tion ... reveals itself in the balance or reconciliation of opposite or discordant qualities: of sameness, with difference; of the general, with the concrete; the idea, with the image...\" The faculty of imagination, in other words, assimilates and synthesizes the most disparate elements into an organic whole\u2014that is, a newly generated unity, constituted by an interdependence of parts whose iden\u00ad tity cannot survive their removal from the whole. (See organic form.) Most critics after Coleridge who distinguished fancy from imagination tended to make fancy simply the faculty that produces a lesser, lighter, or 88 FEMINIST CRITICISM humorous kind of poetry, and to make imagination the faculty that produces a higher, more serious, and more passionate poetry. And the concept of \"imagination\" itself is as various as the modes of psychology that critics have adopted (associationist, Gestalt, Freudian, fung\u00edan), while its processes vary ac\u00ad cording to the way in which a critic conceives of the nature of a poem (as es\u00ad sentially realistic or essentially visionary, as a verbal construction or as \"myth,\" as \"pure poetry\" or as a work designed to produce effects on an audi\u00ad ence). See I. A. Richards, Coleridge on Imagination (1934); M. H. Abrams, The Mir\u00ad ror and the Lamp (1953), chapter 7; Richard H. Fogle, The Idea of Coleridge's Criticism (1962). Feminist Criticism. As a distinctive and concerted approach to literature, feminist criticism was not inaugurated until late in the 1960s. Behind it, how\u00ad ever, lie two centuries of struggle for the recognition of women's cultural roles and achievements, and for women's social and political rights, marked by such books as Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), John Stuart Mill's The Subjection of Women (1869), and the American Margaret Fuller's Woman in the Nineteenth Century (1845). Much of feminist literary criticism continues in our time to be interrelated with the movement by political feminists for social, legal, and cultural freedom and equality. An important precursor in feminist criticism was Virginia Woolf, who, in addition to her fiction, wrote A Room of One's Own (1929) and numerous other essays on women authors and on the cultural, economic, and educational dis\u00ad abilities within what she called a \"patriarchal\" society that have hindered or prevented women from realizing their productive and creative possibilities. (See the collection of her essays, Women and Writing, \u00e9d. M. Barrett, 1979.) A much more radical critical mode was launched in France by Simone de Beau- voir's The Second Sex (1949), a wide-ranging critique of the cultural identifica\u00ad tion of women as merely the negative object, or \"Other,\" to man as the dominating \"Subject\" who is assumed to represent humanity in general; the book dealt also with \"the great collective myths\" of women in the works of many male writers. In America, modern feminist criticism was inaugurated by Mary Ellman's deft and witty discussion, in Thinking about Women (1968), about the derogatory stereotypes of women in literature written by men, and also about alternative and subversive points of view in some writings by women. Even more influential was Kate Millett's hard-hitting Sexual Politics, published the following year. By \"politics\" Millett signifies the mechanisms that express and enforce the relations of power in society; she analyzes West\u00ad ern social arrangements and institutions as covert ways of manipulating power so as to establish and perpetuate the dominance of men and the subor\u00ad dination of women. In her book she attacks the male bias in Freud's psycho\u00ad analytic theory and also analyzes selected passages by D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, Norman Mailer, and Jean Genet as revealing the ways in which the au\u00ad thors, in their fictional fantasies, aggrandize their aggressive phallic selves and degrade women as submissive sexual objects. FEMINIST CRITICISM 89 Since 1969 there has been an explosion of feminist writings without par\u00ad allel in previous critical innovations, in a movement that, as Elaine Showalter has remarked, displays the urgency and excitement of a religious awakening. This current criticism, in America, England, France, and other countries, is not a unitary theory or procedure. It manifests, among those who practice it, a great variety of critical vantage points and procedures, including adapta\u00ad tions of psychoanalytic, Marxist, and diverse poststructuralist theories, and its vitality is signalized by the vigor (sometimes even rancor) of the debates within the ranks of professed feminists themselves. The various feminisms, however, share certain assumptions and concepts that underlie the diverse ways that individual critics explore the factor of sexual difference and privi\u00ad lege in the production, the form and content, the reception, and the critical analysis and evaluation of works of literature: (1) The basic view is that Western civilization is pervasively patriarchal (ruled by the father)\u2014that is, it is male-centered and controlled, and is organized and conducted in such a way as to subordinate women to men in all cultural domains: familial, religious, political, eco\u00ad nomic, social, legal, and artistic. From the Hebrew Bible and Greek philosophic writings to the present, the female tends to be defined by negative reference to the male as the human norm, hence as an Other, or kind of non-man, by her lack of the identifying male organ, of male powers, and of the male character traits that are presumed, in the patriarchal view, to have achieved the most important scientific and technical inventions and the major works of civilization and cul\u00ad ture. Women themselves are taught, in the process of being social\u00ad ized, to internalize the reigning patriarchal ideology (that is, the conscious and unconscious presuppositions about male superiority), and so are conditioned to derogate their own sex and to cooperate in their own subordination. (2) It is widely held that while one's sex is determined by anatomy, the prevailing concepts of gender\u2014of the traits that are conceived to constitute what is masculine and what is feminine in identity and be\u00ad havior\u2014are largely, if not entirely, cultural constructs that were gen\u00ad erated by the pervasive patriarchal biases of our civilization. As Simone de Beauvoir put it, \"One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman. ... It is civilization as a whole that produces this crea\u00ad ture .. . which is described as feminine.\" By this cultural process, the masculine in our culture has come to be widely identified as active, dominating, adventurous, rational, creative; the feminine, by system\u00ad atic opposition to such traits, has come to be identified as passive, ac\u00ad quiescent, timid, emotional, and conventional. (3) The further claim is that this patriarchal (or \"masculinist,\" or \"andro\u00ad centric\") ideology pervades those writings which have been tradition\u00ad ally considered great literature, and which until recently have been written mainly by men for men. Typically, the most highly regarded 90 FEMINIST CRITICISM literary works focus on male protagonists\u2014Oedipus, Ulysses, Hamlet, Tom Jones, Faust, the Three Musketeers, Captain Ahab, Huck Finn, Leopold Bloom\u2014who embody masculine traits and ways of feeling and pursue masculine interests in masculine fields of action. To these males, the female characters, when they play a role, are marginal and subordinate, and are represented either as complementary to or in opposition to masculine desires and enterprises. Such works, lacking autonomous female role models, and implicitly addressed to male readers, either leave the woman reader an alien outsider or else solicit her to identify against herself by taking up the position of the male subject and so assuming male values and ways of perceiving, feeling, and acting. It is often held, in addition, that the traditional aesthetic categories and criteria for analyzing and appraising literary works, al\u00ad though represented in standard critical theory as objective, disinter\u00ad ested, and universal, are in fact infused with masculine assumptions, interests, and ways of reasoning, so that the standard selection and rankings, and also the critical treatments, of literary works have in fact been tacitly but thoroughly gender-biased. A major interest of feminist critics in English-speaking countries has been to reconstitute the ways we deal with literature in order to do justice to female points of view, concerns, and values. One emphasis has been to alter the way a woman reads the literature of the past so as to make her not an acquiescent, but (in the title of Judith Fetterley's book published in 1978) The Resisting Reader; that is, one who resists the author's intentions and design in order, by a \"revisionary rereading,\" to bring to light and to counter the covert sexual biases written into a literary work. Another prominent procedure has been to identify recurrent and distorting \"images of women,\" especially in novels and poems written by men. These images are often represented as tending to fall into two antithetic patterns. On the one side we find idealized projections of men's desires (the Madonna, the Muses of the arts, Dante's Beatrice, the pure and innocent virgin, the \"Angel in the House\" that was represented in the writings of the Victorian poet Coventry Patmore). On the other side are de\u00ad monic projections of men's sexual resentments and terrors (Eve and Pandora as the sources of all evil, destructive sensual temptresses such as Delilah and Circe, the malign witch, the castrating mother). While many feminist critics have decried the literature written by men for its depiction of women as mar\u00ad ginal, docile, and subservient to men's interests and emotional needs and fears, some of them have also identified male writers who, in their view, have managed to rise above the sexual prejudices of their time sufficiently to un\u00ad derstand and represent the cultural pressures that have shaped the characters of women and forced upon them their negative or subsidiary social roles; the latter class is said to include, in selected works, such authors as Chaucer, Shakespeare, Samuel Richardson, Henrik Ibsen, and George Bernard Shaw. A number of feminists have concentrated, not on the woman as reader, but on what Elaine Showalter calls gynocriticism\u2014that is, a criticism which FEMINIST CRITICISM 91 concerns itself with developing a specifically female framework for dealing with works written by women, in all aspects of their production, motivation, analysis, and interpretation, and in all literary forms, including journals and letters. Notable books in this mode include Patricia Meyer Spacks' The Female Imagination (1975), on English and American novels of the past three hundred years; Ellen Moers' Literary Women (1976), on major women novelists and poets in England, America, and France; Elaine Showalter's A Literature of Their Own: British Women Novelists from Bront\u00eb to Lessing (1977); and Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar' The Madwoman in the Attic (1979). This last book stresses es\u00ad pecially the psychodynamics of women writers in the nineteenth century. Its authors propose that the \"anxiety of authorship,\" resulting from the stereo\u00ad type that literary creativity is an exclusively male prerogative, effected in women writers a psychological duplicity that projected a monstrous counter- figure to the idealized heroine, typified by Bertha Rochester, the madwoman in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre; such a figure is \"usually in some sense the au\u00ad thor's double, an image of her own anxiety and rage.\" (Refer to influence and the anxiety of influence.) One concern of gynocritics is to identify what are taken to be the distinc\u00ad tively feminine subject matters in literature written by women\u2014the world of domesticity, for example, or the special experiences of gestation, giving birth, and nurturing, or mother-daughter and woman-woman relations\u2014in which personal and affectional issues, and not external activism, are the primary interest. Another concern is to uncover in literary history a female tradition, incorporated in subcommunities of women writers who were aware of, emu\u00ad lated, and found support in earlier women writers, and who in turn provide models and emotional support to their own readers and successors. A third undertaking is to show that there is a distinctive feminine mode of experi\u00ad ence, or \"subjectivity,\" in thinking, feeling, valuing, and perceiving oneself and the outer world. Related to this is the attempt (thus far, without much agreement about details) to specify the traits of a \"woman's language,\" or dis\u00ad tinctively feminine style of speech and writing, in sentence structure, types of relations between the elements of a discourse, and characteristic figures and imagery. Some feminists have turned their critical attention to the great num\u00ad ber of women's domestic and \"sentimental\" novels, which are noted perfunc\u00ad torily and in derogatory fashion in standard literary histories, yet which dominated the market for fiction in the nineteenth century and produced most of the best-sellers of the time; instances of this last critical enterprise are Elaine Showalter's A Literature of Their Own (1977) on British writers, and Nina Baym's Woman's Fiction: A Guide to Novels by and about Women in America, 1820-1870 (1978). Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar have described the later history of women's writings in No Man's Land: The Place of the Woman Writer in the Twentieth Century (2 vols.; 1988-89). The often-asserted goal of feminist critics has been to enlarge and re\u00ad order, or in radical instances entirely to displace, the literary canon\u2014that is, the set of works which, by a cumulative consensus, have come to be consid\u00ad ered \"major\" and to serve as the chief subjects of literary history, criticism, 92 FEMINIST CRITICISM scholarship, and teaching (see canon of literature). Feminist studies have served to raise the status of many female authors hitherto more or less scanted by scholars and critics (including Anne Finch, George Sand, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Elizabeth Gaskell, Christina Rossetti, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette) and to bring into purview other authors who have been largely or entirely overlooked as subjects for serious consideration (among them Margaret Cavendish, Aphra Behn, Lady Mary Perkins of African-American writers such as Zora Neale Hurston). Some feminists have devoted their critical attention especially to the literature written by lesbian writers, or that deals with lesbian relationships in a heterosexual culture. (See queer theory.) American and English critics have for the most part engaged in empirical and thematic studies of writings by and about women. The most prominent feminist critics in France, however, have been occupied with the \"theory\" of the role of gender in writing, conceptualized within various poststructural frames of reference, and above all Jacques Lacan's reworkings of Freudian psy\u00ad choanalysis in terms of Saussure's linguistic theory. English-speaking femi\u00ad nists, for example, have drawn attention to demonstrable and specific evidences that a male bias is encoded in our linguistic conventions; instances include the use of \"man\" or \"mankind\" for human beings in general, of \"chairman\" and \"spokesman\" for people of either sex, and of the pronouns \"he\" and \"his\" to refer back to and Nelly Furman, eds., Women and Language in Literature and Society, 1980). The radical claim of some French theorists, on the other hand, whatever their differences, is that all Western languages, in all their fea\u00ad tures, are utterly and irredeemably male-engendered, male-constituted, and male-dominated. Discourse, it is asserted, in a term proposed by Lacan, is phallogocentric; that is, it is centered and organized throughout by implicit recourse to the phallus (used in a symbolic rather than a literal sense) both as its supposed \"logos,\" or ground, and as its prime signifier and power source. Phallogocentrism, it is claimed, manifests itself in Western discourse not only in its vocabulary and syntax, but also in its rigorous rules of logic, its procliv\u00ad ity for fixed classifications and oppositions, and its criteria for what is tradi\u00ad tionally considered to be valid evidence and objective knowledge. A basic problem for the French theorists is to establish the very possibility of a woman's language that will not, when a woman writes, automatically be ap\u00ad propriated into this phallogocentric language, since such appropriation is said to force her into complicity with linguistic features that impose on females a condition of marginality and subservience, or even of linguistic nonentity. To evade this dilemma, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous posits (\u00e9criture f\u00e9minine) which has its source in the mother, in the stage of the mother-child relation before the child acquires the male-centered verbal language. Thereafter, in her view, this prelinguistic and unconscious potentiality manifests itself in those written texts which, FEMINIST CRITICISM 93 abolishing all repressions, undermine and subvert the fixed signification, the logic, and the \"closure\" of our phallocentric language, and open out into a joyous freeplay of meanings. Alternatively, Luce Irigaray posits a \"woman's writing\" which evades the male monopoly and the risk of appropriation into the existing system by establishing as its generative principle, in place of the monolithic phallus, the diversity, fluidity, and multiple possibilities inherent in the structure and erotic functioning of the female sexual organs and in the distinctive nature of female sexual experiences. Julia Kristeva posits a \"chora,\" or prelinguistic, pre-Oedipal, and unsystematized signifying process, centered on the mother, that she labels \"semiotic.\" This process is repressed as we ac\u00ad quire the father-controlled, syntactically ordered, and logical language that she calls \"symbolic.\" The semiotic process, however, can break out in a revo\u00ad lutionary way\u2014her prime example is avant-garde poetry, whether written by women or by men\u2014as a \"heterogeneous destructive causality\" that disrupts and disperses the authoritarian \"subject\" and strikes free of the oppressive order and rationality of our standard discourse which, as the product of the \"law of the Father,\" consigns women to a negative and marginal status. In recent years a number of feminist critics have used poststructuralist po\u00ad sitions and techniques to challenge the category of \"woman\" and other founding concepts of feminism itself. They point out the existence of differ\u00ad ences and adversarial strands within the supposedly monolithic history of pa\u00ad triarchal discourse, and emphasize the inherent linguistic instability in the basic conceptions of \"woman\" or \"the feminine,\" as well as the diversities within these supposedly universal and uniform female identities that result from differences in race, class, nationality, and historical situation. See Bar\u00ad barajohnson, A World of Difference (1987); Rita Felski, Beyond Feminist Aesthet\u00ad ics: Feminist Literature and Social Change (1989); and the essays in Feminism/ Postmodernism, ed. Linda J. Nicholson (1990). Judith Butler, in two influential books, has opposed the notion that the feminist movement requires the con\u00ad cept of a feminine identity; that is, that there exist essential factors that define a woman as a woman. Instead, she elaborates the view that the fundamental features which define gender are social and cultural productions that produce the illusory effect of being natural. Butler proposes instead that we consider gender as a \"performative\"\u2014that to be masculine or feminine or homosexual is not something that one is, but a pre-established condition that one repeat\u00ad edly enacts. (For the concept of \"the performative,\" refer to speech-act theory.) See Judith Butler, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (1990), and Bodies that Matter (1993). Feminist theoretical and critical writings, although recent in origin, ex\u00ad pand yearly in volume and range. There exist a number of specialized feminist journals and publishing houses, almost all colleges and universities now have programs in women's studies and courses in women's literature and feminist criticism, and ever-increasing place is given to writings by and about women in anthologies, periodicals, and conferences. Of the many critical and theoret\u00ad ical innovations of the past several decades (see criticism, cunent theories of), the concern with the effects of sexual differences in the writing, interpretation, 94 FICTION AND TRUTH analysis, and assessment of literature seems destined to have the most promi\u00ad nent and enduring effects on literary history, criticism, and academic instruc\u00ad tion, when conducted by men as well as by women. In addition to the books mentioned above, the following works are espe\u00ad cially useful.

Fiction and Truth. In an inclusive sense, fiction is any literary narrative, whether in prose or verse, which is invented instead of being an account of events that in fact happened. In a narrower sense, however, fiction denotes only narratives that are written in prose (the novel and short story), and some\u00ad times is used simply as a synonym for the novel. Literary prose narratives in which the fiction is to a prominent degree based on biographical, historical, or contemporary facts are often referred to by compound names such as \"fic\u00ad tional biography,\" the historical novel, and the nonfiction novel. Both philosophers and literary critics have concerned themselves with the logical analysis of the types of sentences that constitute a fictional text, FICTION AND TRUTH 95 and especially with the question of their truth, or what is sometimes called their \"truth-value\"\u2014that is, whether, or in just what way, they are subject to the criterion of truth or falsity. Some thinkers have asserted that \"fictional sentences\" should be regarded as referring to a special world, \"created\" by the author, which is analogous to the real world, but possesses it own setting, be\u00ad ings, and mode of coherence. (See M. H. Abrams, The Minor and the Lamp, 1953, pp. 272-85, \"The Poem as Heterocosm\"; James Phelan, Worlds from Words: A Theory of Language in Fiction, 1981.) Others, most notably I. A. Richards, have held that fiction is a form of emotive language composed of pseudostatements; and that whereas a statement in \"referential language\" is \"justified by its truth, i.e., its correspondence . . . with the fact to which it points,\" a pseudostatement \"is justified entirely by its effect in releasing or or\u00ad ganizing our attitudes\" (I. A. Richards, Science and Poetry, 1926). Most current theorists, however, present an elaborated logical version of what Sir Philip Sidney long ago proposed in his Apology for Poetry (published 1595), that a poet \"nothing affirmes, therefore never lyeth. For, as I take it, to lye is to af\u00ad firm that to be true which is false.\" Current versions of this view hold that fic\u00ad tive sentences are meaningful according to the rules of ordinary, nonfictional discourse, but that, in accordance with conventions implicitly shared by the author and reader of a work of fiction, they are not put forward as assertions of fact, and therefore are not subject to the criterion of truth or falsity that ap\u00ad plies to sentences in nonfictional discourse. See Margaret MacDonald, \"The Language of Fiction\" (1954), reprinted in W. E. Kennick, ed., Art and Philoso\u00ad phy (rev., 1979). In speech act theory, a related view takes the form that a writer of fiction only \"pretends\" to make assertions, or \"imitates\" the making of assertions, and so suspends the \"normal illocutionary commitment\" of the writer of such utterances to the claim that what he asserts is true. See John R. Searle, \"The Logical Status of Fictional Discourse,\" in Expression and Meaning: Studies in the Theory of Speech Acts (1979, reprinted 1986). We find in a number of other theorists the attempt to extend the concept of \"fictive utterances\" to include all the genres of literature\u2014poems, narratives, and dramas, as well as novels; all these forms, it is proposed, are imitations, or fictive representations, of some type of \"natural\" discourse. A novel, for example, not only is made up of fictional utterances, but is itself a fictive utterance, in that it \"represents the verbal action of a man [i.e., the narrator] reporting, describing, and referring.\" See Barbara Hernnstein Smith, \"Poetry as Fiction,\" in Margins of Discourse (1978), and Richard Ohmann, \"Speech Acts and the Definition of Literature,\" Philosophy and Rhetoric 4 (1971). Most modern critics of prose fiction, whatever their persuasion, make an important distinction between the fictional scenes, persons, events, and dia\u00ad logue that a narrator reports or describes and the narrator's own assertions about the world, about human life, or about the human situation; the central, or controlling, generalizations of the latter sort are said to be the theme or the\u00ad sis of a work. These assertions by the narrator may be explicit (for example, Thomas Hardy's statement at the end of Tess oftheDVrbervilles, \"The President 96 FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE of the immortals had had his sport with Tess\"; or Tolstoy's philosophy of his\u00ad tory at the end of War and Peace). Many such assertions, however, are said to be merely \"implied,\" \"suggested,\" or \"inferrable\" from the narrator's choice and control of the fictional characters and plot of the narrative itself. It is often claimed that such generalizations by the narrator within a fictional work, whether expressed or implied, function as assertions that claim to be true about the world, and that they thereby relate the fictional narrative to the factual and moral world of actual experience. See John Hospers, \"Implied Truths in Litera\u00ad ture\" (1960), reprinted in W. E. Kennick, ed., Art and Philosophy (rev., 1979). A much-discussed topic, related to the question of an author's assertions and truth-claims in narrative fiction, is that of the role of the beliefs of the reader. The problem raised is the extent to which a reader's own moral, reli\u00ad gious, and social convictions, as they coincide with or diverge from those as\u00ad serted or implied in a work, determine the interpretation, acceptability, and evaluation of that work by the reader. For the history and discussions of this problem in literary criticism, see William Joseph Rooney, The Problem of \"Po\u00ad etry and Belief in Contemporary Criticism (1949); M. H. Abrams, editor and contributor, Literature and Belief (1957); Walter Benn Michaels, \"Saving the Text: Reference and Belief,\" Modern Language Notes 93 (1978). Many discus\u00ad sions of the question of belief in fiction cite S. T. Coleridge's description of the reader's attitude as a \"willing suspension of disbelief.\" A review of theories concerning the relevance of the criterion of truth to fiction is Monroe C. Beardsley's Aesthetics: Problems in the Philosophy of Criti\u00ad cism (1958), pp. 409-19. For an analysis and critique of theories of emotive language see Max Black, \"Questions about Emotive Meaning,\" in Language and Philosophy (1949), chapter 9. Gerald Graff defends propositional truth in poetry in Poetic Statement and Critical Dogma (1970), chapter 6. In the writings of Jacques Derrida and his followers in literary criticism, the opposition truth/falsity is one of the metaphysical presuppositions of Western thought that they put to question; see deconstruction. For a detailed treatment of the re\u00ad lations of fictions to the real world, including a survey of diverse answers to this problem, see Peter Lamarque and Stein Haugom Olsen, Truth, Fiction and Literature: A Philosophical Perspective (1994). Figurative Language is a conspicuous departure from what users of a lan\u00ad guage apprehend as the standard meaning of words, or else the standard order of words, in order to achieve some special meaning or effect. Figures are some\u00ad times described as primarily poetic, but they are integral to the functioning of language and indispensable to all modes of discourse. Most modern classifications and analyses are based on the treatment of figurative language by Aristotle and later classical rhetoricians; the fullest and most influential treatment is in the Roman Quintilian's Institutes of Oratory (first century A.D.), Books VIII and IX. Since that time, figurative language has often been divided into two classes: (1) Figures of thought, or tropes (mean\u00ad ing \"turns,\" \"conversions\"), in which words or phrases are used in a way that effects a conspicuous change in what we take to be their standard meaning. FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 97 The standard meaning, as opposed to its meaning in the figurative use, is called the literal meaning. (2) Figures of speech, or rhetorical figures, or schemes (from the Greek word for \"form\"), in which the departure from stan\u00ad dard usage is not primarily in the meaning of the words, but in the order or syntactical pattern of the words. This distinction is not a sharp one, nor do all critics agree on its application. For convenience of exposition, however, the most commonly identified tropes are treated here, and the most commonly identified figures of speech are collected in the article rhetorical figures. For re\u00ad cent opposition to the basic distinction between the literal and the figurative, see metaphor, theories of. In a simile, a comparison between two distinctly different things is ex\u00ad plicitly indicated by the word \"like\" or \"as.\" A simple example is Robert Burns, \"O my love's like a red, red rose.\" The following simile from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" also specifies the fea\u00ad ture (\"green\") in which icebergs are similar to emerald: And ice, mast-high, came floating by, As green as emerald. For highly elaborated types of simile, see conceit and epic simile. In a metaphor, a word or expression that in literal usage denotes one kind of thing is applied to a distinctly different kind of thing, without assert\u00ad ing a comparison. For example, if Burns had said \"O my love is a red, red rose\" he would have uttered, technically speaking, a metaphor instead of a simile. Here is a more complex metaphor from the poet Stephen Spender, in which he describes the eye as it perceives a landscape: Eye, gazelle, delicate wanderer, Drinker of horizon's fluid line.* For the distinction between metaphor and symbol, see symbol. It should be noted that in these examples we can distinguish two ele\u00ad ments, the metaphorical term and the subject to which it is applied. In a widely adopted usage, I. A. Richards introduced the name tenor for the sub\u00ad ject (\"my love\" in the altered line from Burns, and \"eye\" in Spender's lines), and the name vehicle for the metaphorical term itself (\"rose\" in Burns, and the three words \"gazelle,\" \"wanderer,\" and \"drinker\" in Spender). In an im\u00ad plicit metaphor, the tenor is not itself specified, but only implied. If one were to say, while discussing someone's death, \"That reed was too frail to survive the storm of its sorrows,\" the situational and verbal context of the term \"reed\" indicates that it is the vehicle for an implicit tenor, a human being, while \"storm\" is the vehicle for an aspect of a specified tenor, \"sorrows.\" Those aspects, properties, or common associations of a vehicle which, in a given context, apply to a tenor are called by Richards the grounds of a metaphor. (See I. A. Richards, Philosophy of Rhetoric, 1936, chapters 5-6.) * Lines from \"Not palaces, an era's crown,\" from Collected Poems, 1928-1953, by Stephen Spender. Copyright 1934 by The Modern Library, Inc., and renewed 1962 by Stephen Spender. Reprinted by permission of Random House, Inc., and Faber & Faber Ltd. 98 FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE All the metaphoric terms, or vehicles, cited so far have been nouns, but other parts of speech may also be used metaphorically. The metaphoric use of a verb occurs in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice, V. i. 54, \"How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank\"; and the metaphoric use of an Andrew Marvell's \"The Garden\" (1681): Annihilating all that's made To a green thought in a green shade. A mixed metaphor conjoins two or more obviously diverse metaphoric vehicles. When used inadvertently, without sensitivity to the possible incon\u00ad gruity of the vehicles, the effect can be ludicrous: \"Girding up his loins, the chairman plowed through the mountainous agenda.\" Densely figurative poets such as Shakespeare, however, often mix metaphors in a functional way. One example is Hamlet's expression of his troubled state of mind in his solilo\u00ad quy (III. i. 59-60), \"to take arms against a sea of trouble, / And by opposing end them\"; another is the complex involvement of vehicle within vehicle, ap\u00ad plied to the process of aging, in Shakespeare's Sonnet 65: O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out Against the wrackful siege of battering days? A dead metaphor is one which, like \"the leg of a table\" or \"the heart of the matter,\" has been used so long and become so common that its users have ceased to be aware of the discrepancy between vehicle and tenor. Many dead metaphors, however, are only moribund and can be brought back to life. Someone asked Groucho Marx, \"Are you a man or a mouse?\" He answered, \"Throw me a piece of cheese and you'll find out.\" The recorded history of lan\u00ad guage indicates that most words that we now take to be literal were, in the dis\u00ad tant past, metaphors. Metaphors are essential to the functioning of language and have been the subject of copious analyses, and sharp disagreements, by rhetoricians, lin\u00ad guists, literary critics, and philosophers of language. For a discussion of di\u00ad verse views, see the entry metaphor, theories of. Some tropes, sometimes classified as species of metaphor, are more fre\u00ad quently and usefully given names of their own: In metonymy (Greek for \"a change of name\") the literal term for one thing is applied to another with which it has become closely associated be\u00ad cause of a recurrent relationship in common experience. Thus \"the crown\" or \"the scepter\" can be used to stand for a king and \"Hollywood\" for the film in\u00ad dustry; \"Milton\" can signify the writings of Milton (\"I have read all of Mil\u00ad ton\"); and typical attire can signify the male and female sexes: \"doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat\" (Shakespeare, As You Like It, II. iv. 6). (For the influential distinction by the linguist Roman Jakobson be\u00ad tween the m\u00e9tonymie, or \"horizontal,\" di\u00ad mension, in application to many aspects of the functioning of language, see under linguistics in literary criticism.) In synecdoche (Greek for \"taking together\"), a part of something is used to signify the whole, or (more rarely) the whole is used to signify a part. We use FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE 99 the term \"ten hands\" for ten workmen, or \"a hundred sails\" for ships and, in current slang, \"wheels\" to stand for an automobile. In a bold use of the figure, Milton describes the corrupt and greedy clergy in \"Lycidas\" as \"blind mouths.\" Another figure related to metaphor is personification, or in the Greek term, prosopopeia, in which either an inanimate object or an abstract con\u00ad cept is spoken of as though it were endowed with life or with human attri\u00ad butes or feelings (compare pathetic fallacy). Milton wrote in Paradise Lost (IX. 1002-3), as Adam bit into the fatal apple, Sky lowered, and muttering thunder, some sad drops Wept at completing of the mortal sin. The second stanza of Keats' \"To Autumn\" finely personifies the season, au\u00ad tumn, as a woman carrying on the rural chores of that time of year; and in Au\u00ad rora Leigh, I. 251-2, Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote: Then, land!\u2014then, England! oh, the frosty cliffs Looked cold upon me. The personification of abstract terms was standard in eighteenth-century po\u00ad etic diction, where it sometimes became a thoughtless formula. Coleridge cited an eighteenth-century ode celebrating the invention of inoculation against smallpox that began with this apostrophe to the personified subject of the poem: Inoculation! heavenly Maid, descend! See Steven Knapp, Personification and the Sublime (1986). The term kenning denotes the recurrent use, in the Anglo-Saxon Beowulf and poems written in other Old Germanic languages, of a descriptive phrase in place of the ordinary name for something. This type o\u00ed periphrasis, which at times becomes a stereotyped expression, is an indication of the origin of these poems in oral tradition (see oral formulaic poetry). Some kennings are instances of metonymy (\"the whale road\" for the sea, and of synecdoche a ship); still others describe salient or picturesque features of the object referred to (\"foamy-necked floater\" for a ship under sail, \"storm of swords\" for a battle). Other departures from the standard use of words, often classified as tropes, are treated elsewhere in this Glossary: aporia, conceit, epic simile, hyper\u00ad bole, irony, litotes, paradox, periphrasis, pun, understatement. In recent decades, especially in the New Criticism, Russian formalism, deconstruction, and Harold Bloom's theory of the anxiety of influence, there has been a great interest in the analysis and functioning of figurative language, which was once thought to be largely the province of pedantic rhetoricians. A clear summary of the classification of figures that was inherited from the classical past is Edward P. J. Corbett, Classical Rhetoric for the Modern Student (3d ed., 1990). Sister Miriam Joseph's Shakespeare's Use of the Arts of Language (1947) treats the conventional analysis of figures in the Renaissance. Ren\u00e9 Wellek and Austin Warren, in Theory of Literature (rev., 1970), summarize, with bibliography, diverse treatments of figurative language; and Jonathan Culler, 100 FOLKLORE in Structuralist Poetics (1975) and The Pursuit of Signs (1981), discusses the con\u00ad cern with the subject in recent critical theories. Folklore; since the mid-nineteenth century, has been the collective name applied to sayings, verbal compositions, and social rituals that have been handed down solely, or at least primarily, by word of mouth and example rather than in written form. Folklore developed, and continues even now, in communities where few if any people can read or write. It also continues to flourish among literate populations, in the form of oral jokes, stories, and va\u00ad rieties of wordplay; see, for example, the collection of \"urban folklore\" by Alan Dundes and Carl R. Pagter, When You're up to Your Ass in Alligators: More Urban Folklore from the Paperwork Empire (1987). Folklore includes legends, su\u00ad perstitions, songs, tales, proverbs, riddles, spells, and nursery rhymes; pseudo- scientific lore about the weather, plants, and animals; customary activities at births, marriages, and deaths; and traditional dances and forms of drama which are performed on holidays or at communal gatherings. Elements of folklore have at all times entered into sophisticated written literature. For ex\u00ad ample, the choice among the three caskets in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice (II. ix.) and the superstition about a maiden's dream which is central to Keats' Eve of St Agnes (1820) are both derived from folklore. Refer to A. H. Krappe, Science of Folklore (1930, reprinted 1974); Richard M. Dorson, ed. Folklore and Folklife: An Introduction (1972). The following forms of folklore have been of special importance for later written literature: Folk drama originated in primitive rites of song and dance, especially in connection with agricultural activities, which centered on vegetational deities and goddesses of fertility. Some scholars maintain that Greek tragedy devel\u00ad oped from such rites, which celebrated the life, death, and rebirth of the veg\u00ad etational god Dionysus. Folk dramas survive in England in such forms as the St. George play and the mummers' play (a \"mummer\" is a masked actor). Thomas Hardy's The Return of the Native (Book II, chapter 5) describes the per\u00ad formance of a mummers' play, and a form of this drama is still performed in America in the Kentucky mountains. See Edmund K. Chambers, The English Folk-Play (1933). Folk songs include love songs, Christmas carols, work songs, sea chanties, religious songs, drinking songs, children's game-songs, and many other types of lyric, as well as the narrative song, or traditional ballad. (See oral formulaic poetry.) All forms of folk song have been assiduously collected since the late eighteenth century, and have inspired many imitations by writers of lyric poetry, as well as by composers of popular songs in the twentieth cen\u00ad tury. Robert Burns collected and edited Scottish folk songs, restored or rewrote them, and imitated them in his own lyrics. His \"A Red, Red Rose\" and \"Auld Lang Syne,\" for example, both derive from one or more folk songs, and his \"Green Grow the Rashes, O\" is a tidied-up version of a bawdy folk song. See J. C. Dick, The Songs of Robert Burns (1903); Cecil J. Sharp, Folk Songs of England (5 vols., 1908-12); and Alan Lomax, The Folk Songs of North America (1960). FORM AND STRUCTURE 1 01 The folktale, strictly defined, is a short narrative in prose of unknown authorship which has been transmitted orally; many of these tales eventually achieve written form. The term, however, is often extended to include stories invented by a known author\u2014such as \"The Three Bears\" by Robert Southey (1774-83) and Parson Mason L. Weems' story of George Washington and the cherry tree\u2014which have been picked up and repeatedly narrated by word of mouth as well as in written form. Folktales are found among peoples every\u00ad where in the world. They include myths, fables, tales of heroes (whether his\u00ad torical like Johnny Appleseed or legendary like Paul Bunyan), and fairy tales. Many so-called \"fairy tales\" (the German word M\u00e4rchen is frequently used for this type of folktale) are not stories of fairies but of various kinds of mar\u00ad vels; examples are \"Snow White\" and \"Jack and the Beanstalk.\" Another type of folk tale, the set \"joke\"\u2014that is, the comic (often bawdy) anecdote\u2014is the most abundant and persistent of all; new jokes, or new versions of old jokes, continue to be a staple of contemporary social exchange, wherever people congregate in a relaxed mood. The same, or closely similar, oral stories have turned up in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and have been embodied in the narratives of many writers. Chaucer's Canterbury Tales includes a number of folktales; \"The Pardoner's Tale\" of Death and the three rioters, for example, was of Eastern origin. See Benjamin A. Botkin, A Treasury of American Folklore (1944), Stith Thompson, The Folktale (1974), and Vladimir Propp, Morphology of the Folktale (1970). The standard catalogue of recurrent motifs in folktales throughout the world is Stith Thompson's Motif-Index of Folk-Literature (1932-37). Form and Structure. \"Form\" is one of the most frequent terms in literary criticism, but also one of the most diverse in its meanings. It is often used merely to designate a genre or literary type (\"the lyric form,\" \"the short story form\"), or for patterns of meter, lines, and rhymes (\"the verse form,\" \"the stanza form\"). It is also, however\u2014in a meaning descended from the Latin \"forma,\" which was equivalent to the Greek \"idea\"\u2014the term for a central critical concept. In this application, the form of a work is the principle that determines how a work is ordered and organized; critics, however, differ greatly in their analyses of this principle. All agree that \"form\" is not simply a fixed container, like a bottle, into which the \"content\" or \"subject matter\" of a work is poured; but beyond this, the concept of form varies according to a critic's particular assumptions and theoretical orientation (see criticism). Many neoclassic critics, for example, thought of the form of a work as a combination of component parts, matched to each other according to the principle of decorum, or mutual fittingness. In the early nineteenth century Samuel Taylor Coleridge, following the lead of the German critic A. W Schlegel, distinguished between mechanic form, which is a fixed, pr\u00e9existent shape such as we impose on wet clay by a mold, and organic form, which, as Coleridge says, \"is innate; it shapes as it develops itself from within, and the fullness of its development is one and the same with the perfection of its out\u00ad ward form.\" To Coleridge, in other words, as to other organicists in literary 102 FORMALISM criticism, a good poem is like a growing plant which evolves, by an internal energy, into the organic unity that constitutes its achieved form, in which the parts are integral to and interdependent with the whole. On organic criticism and the concept of organic form, see M. H. Abrams, The Minor and the Lamp (1953), chapters 7-8; and George Rousseau, Organic Form (1972). Many New Critics use the word structure interchangeably with \"form,\" and regard it as primarily an equilibrium, or interaction, or ironic and paradoxical tension, of diverse words and images in an organized totality of \"meanings.\" Various ex\u00ad ponents of archetypal theory regard the form of a literary work as one of a lim\u00ad ited number of plot-shapes which it shares with myths, rituals, dreams, and other elemental and recurrent patterns of human experience. And structural\u00ad ist critics conceive a literary structure on the model of the systematic way that a language is structured; see structuralist criticism. In an influential critical enterprise, R. S. Crane, a leader of the Chicago School of criticism, revived and developed the concept of form in Aristotle's Poetics, and made a distinction between \"form\" and \"structure.\" The form of a literary work is (in the Greek term) the \"dynamis,\" the particular \"working\" or \"emotional 'power'\" that the composition is designed to effect, which functions as its \"shaping principle.\" This formal principle controls and syn\u00ad thesizes the \"structure\" of a work\u2014that is, the order, emphasis, and rendering of all its component subject matter and parts\u2014into \"a beautiful and effective whole of a determinate kind.\" See R. S. Crane, The Languages of Criticism and the Structure of Poetry (1953), chapters 1 and 4; also Wayne C. Booth, \"Between Two Generations: The Heritage of the Chicago School,\" in Profession 82 (Mod\u00ad ern Language Association, 1982). See formalism and refer to Ren\u00e9 Wellek, \"Concepts of Form and Structure in Twentieth-Century Criticism,\" in Concepts of Criticism (1963); Kenneth Burke, The Philosophy of Literary Form (3d ed., 1973); and Eug\u00e8ne Vinaver, Form and Meaning in Medieval Romance (1966). Formalism. A type of literary theory and analysis which originated in Moscow and St. Petersburg in the second decade of this century. At first, op\u00ad ponents of the movement of Russian Formalism applied the term \"formal\u00ad ism\" derogatorily, because of its focus on the formal patterns and technical devices of literature to the exclusion of its subject matter and social values; later, however, it became a neutral designation. Among the leading represen\u00ad tatives of the movement were Boris Eichenbaum, Victor Shklovsky, and Roman Jakobson. When this critical mode was suppressed by the Soviets in the early 1930s, the center of the formalist study of literature moved to Czechoslovakia, where it was continued especially by members of the Prague Linguistic Circle, which included Roman Jakobson (who had emigrated from Russia), Jan Mukarovsky, and Ren\u00e9 Wellek. Beginning in the 1940s both Jakobson and Wellek continued their influential work as professors at Ameri\u00ad can universities. Formalism views literature primarily as a specialized mode of language, and proposes a fundamental opposition between the literary (or poetical) use FORMALISM 103 of language and the ordinary, \"practical\" use of language. It conceives that the central function of ordinary language is to communicate to auditors a message, or information, by references to the world existing outside of lan\u00ad guage. In contrast, it conceives literary language to be self-focused, in that its function is not to convey information by making extrinsic references, but to offer the reader a special mode of experience by drawing attention to its own \"formal\" features\u2014that is, to the qualities and internal relations of the lin\u00ad guistic signs themselves. The linguistics of literature differs from the linguis\u00ad tics of practical discourse, because its laws are oriented toward producing the distinctive features that formalists call literariness. As Roman Jakobson wrote in 1921: \"The object of study in literary science is not literature but 'literari\u00ad ness/ that is, what makes a given work a literary work.\" (See linguistics in mod\u00ad ern criticism.) The literariness of a work, as Jan Mukarovsky, a member of the Prague Circle, described it in the 1920s, consists \"in the maximum of foregrounding of the utterance,\" that is, the foregrounding of \"the act of expression, the act of speech itself.\" (To \"foreground\" is to bring something into the highest prominence, to make it dominant in perception.) By \"backgrounding\" the referential aspect and the logical connections in language, poetry makes the words themselves \"palpable\" as phonic signs. The primary aim of literature in thus foregrounding its linguistic medium, as Victor Shklovsky put it in an in\u00ad fluential formulation, is to estrange or defamiliarize; that is, by disrupting the modes of ordinary linguistic discourse, literature \"makes strange\" the world of everyday perception and renews the reader's lost capacity for fresh sensation. (In the Biographia Literaria, 1817, Samuel Taylor Coleridge had long before described the \"prime merit\" of a literary genius to be the representa\u00ad tion of \"familiar objects\" so as to evoke \"freshness of sensation\"; but whereas the Romantic critic had stressed the author's ability to express a fresh mode of experiencing the world, the formalist stresses the function of purely literary devices to produce the effect of freshness in the reader's experience of a liter\u00ad ary work.) The foregrounded properties, or \"artistic devices,\" which estrange poetic language are often described as \"deviations\" from ordinary language. Such deviations, which are analyzed most fully in the writings of Roman Jakobson, consist primarily in setting up and also violating patterns in the sound and syntax of poetic language\u2014including patterns in speech sounds, grammatical constructions, rhythm, rhyme, and stanza forms\u2014and also in setting up prominent recurrences of key words or images. Some of the most fruitful work of Jakobson and others, valid outside the formalist perspective, has been in the analysis of meter and of the repetitions of sounds in alliteration and rhyme. These features of poetry they regard not as supplementary adornments of the meaning, but as effecting a reorganization of language on the semantic as well as the phonic and syntactic levels. For\u00ad malists have also made influential contributions to the theory of prose fic\u00ad tion. With respect to this genre, the central formalist distinction is that between the \"story\" (the simple enumeration of a chronological sequence of events) and a plot. An author is said to transform the raw material of a story 104 FORMALISM into a literary plot by the use of a variety of devices that violate sequence and deform and defamiliarize the story elements; the effect is to foreground the narrative medium and devices themselves, and in this way to disrupt what had been our standard responses to the subject matter. (See nanative and nar- ratology.) American New Criticism, although it developed independently, is some\u00ad times called \"formalist\" because, like European formalism, it stresses the analysis of the literary work as a self-sufficient verbal entity, constituted by in\u00ad ternal relations and independent of reference either to the state of mind of the author or to the \"external\" world. It also, like European formalism, con\u00ad ceives poetry as a special mode of language whose distinctive features are de\u00ad fined in terms of their systematic opposition to practical or scientific language. Unlike the European formalists, however, the New Critics did not apply the science of linguistics to poetry, and their emphasis was not on a work as constituted by linguistic devices for achieving specifically literary ef\u00ad fects, but on the complex interplay within a work of ironic, paradoxical, and metaphoric meanings around a humanly important \"theme.\" The main influ\u00ad ence of Russian and Czech formalism on American criticism has been on the development of stylistics, and of narratology. Roman Jakobson and Tzvetan Todorov have been influential in introducing formalist concepts and methods into French structuralism. Strong opposition to formalism, both in its Euro\u00ad pean and American varieties, has been voiced by some Marxist critics (who view it as the product of a reactionary ideology), and more recently by propo\u00ad nents of reader-response criticism, speech-act theory, and new historicism; these last three types of criticism all reject the view that there is a sharp and defin\u00ad able division between ordinary language and literary language. In the 1990s a number of critics have called for a return to a formalist mode of treating a work of literature primarily as literature, instead of with persistent reference to its stand, whether explicit or covert, on political, racial, or sexual issues. A notable instance is Frank Lentricchia's \"Last Will and Testament of an Ex- literary Critic\" (Lingua Franca, Sept./Oct. 1996), renouncing his earlier writ\u00ad ings and teachings \"about literature as a political instrument,\" in favor of the view \"that literature is pleasurable and important, as literature, and not as an illustration of something else.\" See also Harold Bloom's strong advocacy of reading literature not to confirm a political or social theory but for the love of literature, in The Western Canon (1994); the essays in Aesthetics and Ideology, ed. George Levine (1994); and Susan Wolfson, Formal Charges: The Shaping of Poetry in British Romanticism (1997). (See also objective criticism under criticism.) The standard treatment of the Russian movement is by Victor Erlich, Rus\u00ad sian Formalism: History, Doctrine (rev., 1981). See also R. L. Jackson and S. Rudy, eds., Russian Formalism: A Retrospective Glance (1985). Ren\u00e9 Wellek has described The Literary Theory and Aesthetics of the Prague School (1969).

A comprehensive and influential formalist essay by Roman Jakobson, \"Linguistics and Poetics,\" is included in his Language in Literature (1987). Samuel Levin's Linguistic Structures in Poetry (1962) represents an American application of for\u00ad malist principles, and E. M. Thompson has written Russian Formalism and Anglo- American New Criticism: A Comparative Study (1971). Format of a Book. Format signifies the page-size, shape, and other physical features of a book. The printer begins with a large \"sheet\"; if the sheet is folded once so as to form two \"leaves\" of four pages, the book is a folio (the Latin word for \"leaf\"). When we refer to \"the first Shakespeare folio,\" for example, we mean a volume published in 1623, the first edition of Shakespeare's col\u00ad lected plays, the leaves of which were made by a single folding of the printer's sheets. A sheet folded twice into four leaves makes a quarto; a sheet folded a third time into eight leaves makes an octavo. In a duodecimo volume, a sheet is folded so as to make twelve leaves. The more leaves into which a single sheet is divided, the smaller the leaf, so that these terms indicate the dimensions of a book, but only approximately, because the size of the full sheet varies, espe\u00ad cially in modern printing. It can be said, however, that a folio is a very large book; a quarto is the next in size, with a leaf that is nearly square. The third in size, the octavo, is the most frequently used in modern printing. As this book is open in front of you, the page on the right is called a recto, and the page on the left is called a verso. The colophon in older books was a note at the end stating such facts as the title, author, printer, and date of issue. In modern books the colophon is ordinarily in the front, on the title page. With reference to modern books, \"colophon\" has come to mean, usually, the publisher's emblem, such as a torch (Harper), an owl (Holt), or a ship (Viking). See also the entry edition. Free Verse is sometimes referred to as \"open form\" verse, or by the French term vers libre. Like traditional verse, it is printed in short lines instead of with the continuity of prose, but it differs from such verse by the fact that its rhythmic pattern is not organized into a regular metrical form\u2014that is, into feet, or recurrent units of weak- and strong-stressed syllables. (See meter.) Most free verse also has irregular line lengths, and either lacks rhyme or else uses it only sporadically. (Blank verse differs from unrhymed free verse in that it is metrically regular.) Within these broad boundaries, there is a great diversity in the measures that are labeled free verse. An approximation to one modern form occurs in the King James translation of the biblical Psalms and Song of Solomon, which imitates in English prose the parallelism and cadences of the Hebrew poetry. In the nineteenth century William Blake, Matthew Arnold, and other poets in England and America experimented with departures from regular meters; and in 1855 Walt Whitman startled the literary world with his Leaves of Grass by using verse lines of varying length which depended for rhythmic effects not 1 06 FREE VERSE on recurrent metric feet, but on cadenced units and on the repetition, bal\u00ad ance, and variation of words, phrases, clauses, and lines. French Symbolist poets in the later nineteenth century, and American and English poets of the present century, especially after World War I, began the present era of the in\u00ad tensive use of free verse. It has been employed by Rainer Maria Rilke, Jules Laforgue, T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, and numberless contemporary poets in all the Western languages. Most of the verse in English that is published today is nonmetrical. Among the many modes of open versification in English, we can make a broad distinction between the long-lined and often orotund verses of poets like Whitman and Allen Ginsberg, of which a principal origin is the translated poetry of the Hebrew Bible, and the shorter-lined, conversational, often ironic forms employed by the majority of writers in free verse. In the latter type, poets yield up the drive, beat, and song achievable by traditional meters in order to exploit other rhythmic possibilities. A poem by e. e. cummings will illustrate the effects that become available when the verse is released from a regular line and reiterative beat. Instead, cummings uses conspicuous visual cues\u2014the variable positioning, spacing, and length of words, phrases, and lines\u2014to control pace, pause, and emphasis in the reading, and also to achieve an alternation of suspension and relief, in accordance as the line-ends work against or coincide with the pull toward closure of the units of syntax.

Ammons exemplifies the unobtrusive way in which, even as he departs from them, a free-verse poet can recall and exploit traditional stanza forms and meters: Small Song** The reeds give way to the wind and give the wind away The visual pattern of the printed poem signals that we are to read it as con\u00ad sisting of four equal lines of three words each, and as divided into two stan- zaic couplets. The first line of each stanza ends with the same word \"give,\" not only to achieve tension and release in the suspended syntax of each of the verb-phrases, but also, by means of the parallelism, to enhance our surprise at the shift of meaning from \"give way\" (surrender) to \"give . from \"Mother to Son\" by Langston Hughes.

The poet also adapts standard metric feet to his special purposes: the poem is framed by opening and closing with a reg\u00ad ular iambic foot, yet is free to mimic internally the resistance to the wind in the recurrent strong stresses in the first stanza (The r\u00e9eds give / way) and the graceful yielding to the wind in the succession of light iambs in the second stanza (And give / the wind aw\u00e1y). A number of contemporary poets and critics are calling\u2014in a movement termed the new formalism\u2014for a return from free verse to the meters, rhyme, and stanza-forms of traditional English versification.

Timothy Steele's Missing Measures: Modern Poetry and the Revolt against Meter (1990) is a history of free verse by a writer who argues for a return to metrical versification. Genres. A term, French in origin, that denotes types or classes of literature. The genres into which literary works have been grouped at different times are very numerous, and the criteria on which the classifications have been based are highly variable. Since the writings of Plato and Aristotle, however, there has been an enduring division of the overall literary domain into three large classes, in accordance with who speaks in the work: lyric (uttered throughout in the first person), epic or narrative (in which the narrator speaks in the first person, then lets his characters speak for themselves); and drama (in which the characters do all the talking). A similar tripartite scheme was elaborated by German critics in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, was echoed by James Joyce in his Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916), chap\u00ad ter 5, and functions still in critical discourse and in the general distinction, in college catalogues, between courses in poetry, prose fiction, and drama. Within this overarching division, Aristotle and other classical critics identified a number of more limited genres. Many of the ancient names, in\u00ad cluding epic, tragedy, comedy, and satire, have remained current to the present day; to them have been added, over the last three centuries, such newcomers as biography, essay, and novel. A glance at the articles listed in the Index of Terms under genre will indicate the criss-crossing diversity of the classes and subclasses to which individual works of literature have been assigned. Through the Renaissance and much of the eighteenth century, the recog\u00ad nized genres\u2014or poetic kinds as they were then called\u2014were widely thought to be fixed literary types, somewhat like species in the biological order of na\u00ad ture. Many neoclassic critics insisted that each kind must remain \"pure\" (there must, for example, be no \"mixing\" of tragedy and comedy), and also pro\u00ad posed rules which specified the subject matter, structure, style, and emotional effect proper to each kind. At that time the genres were also commonly GENRES 109 ranked in a hierarchy (related to the ranking of social classes, from royalty and the nobility down to peasants\u2014see decorum), ranging from epic and tragedy at the top to the pastoral, short lyric, epigram, and other types, then considered to be minor genres, at the bottom. Shakespeare satirized the pedantic classifiers of his era in Polonius' catalogue (Hamlet, II. ii.) of types of drama: \"tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical- pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral...\" In the course of the eighteenth century the emergence of new types of lit\u00ad erary productions\u2014such as the novel, and the poem combining description, philosophy, and narrative (James Thomson's Seasons, 1726-30)\u2014helped weaken confidence in the fixity and stability of literary genres. And in the latter eighteenth and early nineteenth century, the extraordinary rise in the promi\u00ad nence and prestige of the short lyric poem, and the concurrent shift in the basis of critical theory to an expressive orientation (see the entry criticism), effected a drastic alteration both in the conception and ranking of literary genres, with the lyric displacing epic and tragedy as the quintessentially poetic type. From the Romantic Period on, a decreasing emphasis on the generic conception of lit\u00ad erature was indicated by the widespread use of criteria for evaluating literature which\u2014unlike the criteria in neoclassic criticism, which tended to be specific to a particular genre\u2014were broadly applicable to all literary works: criteria such as \"sincerity,\" \"intensity\" \"organic unity,\" and \"high seriousness.\" In the New Criticism of the mid-twentieth century, with its ruling concept of the unique\u00ad ness of each literary work, genre ceased to play more than a subordinate role in critical analysis and evaluation. For the changes in the nineteenth century in the classification and ranking of the genres, see M. H. Abrams, The Minor and the Lamp (1953), especially chapters 1, 4, and 6; on the continuance, as well as changes, of writings in the traditional genres during the Romantic Period, see Stuart Curran, Poetic Form and British Romanticism (1986). Since 1950 or so, an emphasis on generic types has been revived by some critical theorists, although on varied principles of classification. R. S. Crane and other Chicago critics have defended the utility for practical criticism of a rede\u00ad fined distinction among genres, based on Aristotle's Poetics, in which works are classified in accordance with the similarity in the principles by which they are organized in order to achieve a particular kind of emotional effect; see Crane, ed., Critics and Criticism (1952), pp. 12-24, 546-63, and refer to the Chicago school in this Glossary. Northrop Frye has proposed an archetypal theory in which the four major genres (comedy, romance, tragedy, and satire) are held to manifest the permanent forms bodied forth by the human imagination, as rep\u00ad resented in the archetypal myths correlated with the four seasons (Anatomy of Criticism, 1957, pp. 158-239). Other current theorists conceive genres as social formations on the model of social institutions, such as the state or church, rather than on the model of biological species. By structuralist critics a genre is conceived as a set of constitutive conventions and codes, altering from age to age, but shared by a kind of implicit contract between writer and reader. These codes make possible the writing of a particular literary text, though the writer may play against, as well as with, the prevailing generic conventions. In the 1 1 0 GOLDEN AGE \u00b7 GOTHIC NOVEL reader, these conventions generate a set of expectations, which may be contro\u00ad verted rather than satisfied, but enable the reader to make the work intelligi\u00ad ble\u2014that is, to naturalize it, by relating it to the world as defined and ordered by codes in the prevailing culture. By many critics at the present time, however, genres are conceived to be more or less arbitrary modes of classification, whose justification is their con\u00ad venience in talking about literature. Some critics have applied to generic classes the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's concept of family resem\u00ad blances. That is, they propose that, in the loosely grouped family of works that make up a genre, there are no essential defining features, but only a set of fam\u00ad ily resemblances; each member shares some of these resemblances with some, but not all, of the other members of the genre. (For a description and discus\u00ad sion of Wittgenstein's view, see Maurice Mandelbaum, \"Family Resemblances and Generalization Concerning the Arts,\" American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 2, 1965, pp. 219-28.) There has also been interest in the role that generic as\u00ad sumptions have played in shaping the work that an author composes, and also in establishing expectations that alter the way that a reader will interpret and respond to a particular work. Whatever the present skepticism, however, about the old belief that genres constitute inherent species in the realm of literature, the fact that generic distinctions remain indispensable in literary discourse is attested by the unceasing publication of books whose titles announce that they deal with tragedy, the lyric, pastoral, the novel, or another of the many types and subtypes into which literature has over the centuries been classified. Reviews of traditional theories of genre are Ren\u00e9 Wellek and Austin War\u00ad ren, Theory of Literature (rev., 1970), chapter 17, and the readable short survey by Heather Dubrow, Genre (1982). For recent developments see Paul Hernadi, Beyond Genre: New Directions in Literary Classification (1972); Alastair Fowler, Kinds of Literature (1982); Adena Rosmarin, The Power of Genre (1986); James Battersby, Reason and the Nature of Texts (1996). Golden Age. The term derives from the form of chronological primitivism that was propounded in the Greek poet Hesiod's Works and Days (eighth century B.C.), as well as by many later Greek and Roman writers. The earliest period of human history, regarded as a state of perfect felicity, was called \"the golden age,\" and the continuous later decline of human well-being through time was expressed by the sequence \"the silver age\" and \"the bronze age,\" ending with the present sad con\u00ad dition of humanity, \"the iron age.\" See primitivism and progress and, for render\u00ad ings of the golden age in the guise of a carefree rural existence, pastoral. Refer to Harry Levin, The Myth of the Golden Age in the Renaissance (1969). Gothic Novel. The word Gothic originally referred to the Goths, an early Germanic tribe, then came to signify \"germanic,\" then \"medieval.\" \"Gothic architecture\" now denotes the medieval type of architecture, characterized by the use of the high pointed arch and vault, flying buttresses, and intricate re\u00ad cesses, which spread through western Europe between the twelfth and six\u00ad teenth centuries. GOTHIC NOVEL The Gothic novel, or in an alternative term, Gothic romance, is a type of prose fiction which was inaugurated by Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto: A Gothic Story (1764)\u2014the subtitle refers to its setting in the middle ages\u2014and flourished through the early nineteenth century. Some writers fol\u00ad lowed Walpole's example by setting their stories in the medieval period; oth\u00ad ers set them in a Catholic country, especially Italy or Spain. The locale was often a gloomy castle furnished with dungeons, subterranean passages, and sliding panels; the typical story focused on the sufferings imposed on an in\u00ad nocent heroine by a cruel and lustful villain, and made bountiful use of ghosts, mysterious disappearances, and other sensational and supernatural occurrences (which in a number of novels turned out to have natural expla\u00ad nations). The principal aim of such novels was to evoke chilling terror by ex\u00ad ploiting mystery and a variety of horrors. Many of them are now read mainly as period pieces, but the best opened up to fiction the realm of the irrational and of the perverse impulses and nightmarish terrors that lie beneath the or\u00ad derly surface of the civilized mind. Examples of Gothic novels are William Beckford's Vathek (1786)\u2014the setting of which is both medieval and Oriental and the subject both erotic and sadistic\u2014Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794) and other highly successful Gothic romances, and Matthew Gregory Lewis' The Monk (1796), which exploited, with considerable literary skill, the shock-effects of a narrative involving rape, incest, murder, and dia\u00ad bolism. Jane Austen made good-humored fun of the more decorous instances of the Gothic vogue in Northanger Abbey (written 1798, published 1818). The term \"Gothic\" has also been extended to a type of fiction which lacks the exotic setting of the earlier romances, but develops a brooding at\u00ad mosphere of gloom and terror, represents events that are uncanny or macabre or melodramatically violent, and often deals with aberrant psychological states. In this extended sense the term \"Gothic\" has been applied to William Godwin's Caleb Williams (1794), Mary Shelley's remarkable and influential Frankenstein (1817), and the novels and tales of terror by the German E. T. A. Hoffmann. Still more loosely, \"Gothic\" has been used to describe elements of the macabre and terrifying in such later works as Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, Charles Dickens' Bleak House (for exam\u00ad ple, chapters 11, 16, and 47) and Great Expectations (the Miss Havisham episodes). Critics have recently drawn attention to the many women writers of Gothic fiction, and have explained the features of the mode as a result of the suppression of female sexuality, also as a challenge to the gender hierar\u00ad chy and values of a male-dominated culture. See feminist criticism and refer to Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, The Madwoman in the Attic (1979), and Ju- liann E. Fleenor, ed., The Female Gothic (1983). America, especially southern America, has been fertile in Gothic fiction in the extended sense, from the novels of Charles Brockden Brown (1771-1810) and the terror tales of Edgar Allan Poe to William Faulkner's Sanctuary and Ab\u00ad salom, Absalom! and some of the fiction of Truman Capote. The nightmarish realm of uncanny terror, violence, and cruelty opened by the Gothic novel continued to be explored in novels such as Daphne du Maurier's popular 112 GRAVEYARD POETS \u00b7 GREAT CHAIN OF BEING Rebecca (1938) and Iris Murdoch's The Unicorn; it is also exploited by writers of horror fiction such as H. P. Lovecraft and Stephen King, and by the writers and directors of horror movies. See G. R. Thompson, ed., The Gothic Imagination: Essays in Dark Romanti\u00ad cism (1974); and William Patrick Day, In the Circles of Fear and Desire (1985); David Punter, The Literature of Tenor: A History of Gothic Fiction from 1765 to the Present (1979, 2d ed., 1996), Eugenia DeLamotte, Perils of the Night (1990); Anne Williams, Art of Darkness (1995). On \"American Gothic\"\u2014and especially the \"southern Gothic\"\u2014see Spirit in the For\u00ad ties,\" Fiction in the Forties (1963). Graveyard Poets. A term applied to eighteenth-century poets who wrote meditative poems, usually set in a graveyard, on the theme of human mortality, in moods which range from elegiac pensiveness to profound gloom. Examples are Thomas Parnell's \"Night-Piece on Death\" (1721), Edward Robert Blair's \"The Grave\" (1743). The vogue resulted in one of the most widely known English poems, Thomas Gray's \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\" (1751). The writing of graveyard poems spread from England to Continental literature in the second part of the century and is rep\u00ad resented in America by William Cullen Bryant's \"Thanatopsis\" (1817). See Amy Louise Reed, The Background of Gray's Elegy (1924). Edith M. Sick- els, in The Gloomy Egoist (1932), follows the evolution of graveyard and other melancholy verse through the Romantic Period. For the vogue in Europe, refer to Paul Von Tieghem, Le Pr\u00e9-romantisme (3 vols., 1924-47). Great Chain of Being. The conception of the Great Chain of Being is grounded in ideas about the nature of God, or the First Cause, in the Greek philosophers Plato, Aristotle, and Plotinus, and was developed by later thinkers into a philosophy to account for the origin, types, and relationships of all living things in the universe. This worldview was already prevalent in the Renaissance, but was refined and greatly developed by the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz early in the eighteenth century, and then adopted by a number of thinkers of the Enlightenment. In its comprehensive eighteenth-century form, the Great Chain of Being was based on the idea that the essential \"excellence\" of God consists in His limitless creativity\u2014that is, in an unstinting overflow of His own being into the fullest possible variety of other beings. From this premise were deduced three consequences: (1) Plenitude. The universe is absolutely full of every possible kind and variety of life; no conceivable species of being remains unrealized. (2) Continuity. Each species differs from the next by the least possible de\u00ad gree, and so merges all but imperceptibly into the species most nearly related to it. (3) Gradation. The existing species exhibit a hierarchy of status, and so compose a great chain, or ladder, of being, extending from the lowli\u00ad est condition of the merest existence up to God Himself. In this chain HAIKU 1 1 3 human beings occupy the middle position between the animal kinds and the angels, or purely spiritual beings. On these concepts Leibniz and other thinkers also grounded what is called the doctrine of philosophical optimism\u2014the view that this is \"the best of all possible worlds\"; but only in the special sense that this is the best world whose existence is logically possible. The reasoning underlying this claim is that, since God's bountifulness consists in His creation of the greatest possible variety of graded beings, aspects of created life that to a limited human point of view seems to be deficiency and evil can be recognized, from an overall cosmic viewpoint, to follow necessarily from the very excellence of the divine nature, which logically entails that there be a progressive set of limitations, hence increasing \"evils,\" as we move farther down along the chain of being. As Voltaire ironically summarized this mode of optimism: \"This is the best of all possible worlds, and everything in it is a necessary evil.\" With his remarkable precision and economy, Alexander Pope compressed the concepts that make up the Great Chain of Being into a half-dozen or so heroic couplets, in Epistle I of his Essay on Man (1732-34): Of systems possible, if 'tis confessed That Wisdom Infinite must form the best, Where all must full or not coherent be, And all that rises rise in due degree; Then in the scale of reasoning life, 'tis plain, There must be, somewhere, such a rank as man.... See, through this air, this ocean, and this earth, All matter quick, and bursting into birth.... Vast Chain of Being! which from God began, Natures ethereal, human, angel, man, Beast, bird, fish, insect, what no eye can see, No glass can reach! from Infinite to thee, From thee to nothing.... Philosophical optimism is one particular form of what is known as a theodicy. This term, compounded of the Greek words for \"God\" and \"right,\" designates any system of thought which sets out to reconcile the assumption that God is perfectly good with the fact that evil exists. Milton's \"great argu\u00ad ment\" in Paradise Lost, by which he undertakes to \"assert Eternal Providence / And justify the ways of God to men\" (I. 24-26) is an example of a traditional Christian theodicy, explaining evil as the result of \"man's first disobedience\" in Eden, that \"Brought death into the world, and all our woe.\" See A. O. Lovejoy's classic work in the history of ideas, The Great Chain of Being (1936); also E. M. W. Tillyard, The Elizabethan World Picture (1943), chapters 4-5, which deals with the prevalence of the concept in Shakespeare's lifetime. Haiku (sometimes spelled hokku) is a Japanese poetic form that represents, in seventeen syllables, ordered into three lines of five, seven, and five sylla\u00ad bles, the poet's emotional or spiritual response to a natural object, scene, or season of the year. The strict form, which relies on the short, uniform, and 1 1 4 HARLEM RENAISSANCE \u00b7 HEROIC COUPLET unstressed syllabic structure of the Japanese language, is very difficult in En\u00ad glish; most poets who attempt the haiku loosen the rule for the number and pattern of the syllables. The haiku greatly influenced Ezra Pound and other Imagists, who set out to reproduce both the brevity and the distinctiveness of the image in the Japanese original. Ezra Pound's \"In a Station of the Metro\" is a well-known instance of the haiku in the loosened English form; see this poem under imagism. Earl R. Miner, The Japanese Tradition in British and American Literature (1958); and R. H. Blyth, A History of Haiku (2 vols., 1963-64); Bruce Ross, ed., Haiku Moment: An Anthology of Contemporary North American Haiku (1993). Harlem Renaissance. A period of remarkable creativity in literature, music, dance, painting, and sculpture by African-Americans, from the end of the First World War in 1917 through the 1920s. As a result of the mass migra\u00ad tions to the urban North in order to escape the legal segregation of the Amer\u00ad ican South, and also in order to take advantage of the jobs opened to African-Americans at the beginning of the War, the population of the region of Manhattan known as Harlem became almost exclusively Black, and the vital center of African-American culture in America. Distinguished writers who were part of the movement included the poets Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes (who also wrote novels and plays), Claude McKay, and Ster\u00ad ling Brown; the novelists Jean Toomer (whose remarkably inventive Cane, 1923, included verse and drama as well as prose fiction), Jessie Fauset, and Wallace Thurman; and many essayists, memoirists, and writers in diverse modes such as James Weldon Johnson, Marcus Garvey, and Arna Bontemps. The Great Depression of 1929 and the early 1930s brought the period of buoyant Harlem culture\u2014which had been fostered by prosperity in the pub\u00ad lishing industry and the art world\u2014effectively to an end. Zora Neale Hurston's novel, Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), and other works, how\u00ad ever, are widely accounted as late products of the Harlem Renaissance. See The New Negro: An Interpretation (1925), an anthology edited by Alain Locke, which did much to define the spirit of the Harlem Renaissance; Arna Bontemps, ed., The Harlem Renaissance Remembered (1972); Margaret Perry, The Harlem Renaissance (1982). Heroic Couplet. Lines of iambic pentameter (see meter) which rhyme in pairs: aa, bb, cc, and so on. The adjective \"heroic\" was applied in the later sev\u00ad enteenth century because of the frequent use of such couplets in heroic (that is, epic) poems and in heroic dramas. This verse form was introduced into En\u00ad glish poetry by Geoffrey Chaucer (in The Legend of Good Women and most of The Canterbury Tales), and has been in constant use ever since. From the age of John Dryden through that of Samuel Johnson, the heroic couplet was the pre\u00ad dominant English measure for all the poetic kinds; some poets, including Alexander Pope, used it almost to the exclusion of other meters. In that era, usually called the Neoclassic Period, the poets wrote in closed couplets, in which the end of each couplet tends to coincide with the end HEROIC DRAMA 1 1 5 either of a sentence or of a self-sufficient unit of syntax. The sustained em\u00ad ployment of the closed heroic couplet meant that two lines had to serve something of the function of a stanza. In order to maximize the interrelations of the component parts of the couplet, neoclassic poets often used an end- stopped first line (that is, made the end of the line coincide with a pause in the syntax), and also broke many single lines into subunits by balancing the line around a strong caesura, or medial pause in the syntax. The following passage from John Denham's Cooper's Hill (which he added in the version of 1655) is an early instance of the artful management of the closed couplet that fascinated later neoclassic poets; they quoted it and com\u00ad mented upon it again and again, and used it as a model for exploiting the pos\u00ad sibilities of this verse form. Note how Denham achieves diversity within the straitness of his couplets by shifts in the position of the caesuras, by the use of rhetorical balance and antithesis between the single lines and between the two halves within a single line, and by the variable positioning of the adjectives in the second couplet. Note also the framing and the emphasis gained by invert\u00ad ing the iambic foot that begins the first line and the last line, and by manipu\u00ad lating similar and contrasting vowels and consonants. The poet is addressing the River Thames: O could I flow like thee, and make thy stream My great example, as it is my theme! Though deep, yet clear; though gentle, yet not dull; Strong without rage, without o'erflowing full. And here is a passage from Alexander Pope, the greatest master of the metri\u00ad cal, syntactical, and rhetorical possibilities of the closed heroic couplet (\"Of the Characters of Women,\" 1735, lines 243-48): See how the world its veterans rewards! A youth of frolics, an old age of cards; Fair to no purpose, artful to no end, Young without lovers, old without a friend; A fop their passion, but their prize a sot; Alive, ridiculous, and dead, forgot! These closed neoclassic couplets contrast with the \"open\" pentameter couplets quoted from Keats' Endymion in the entry on meter. In the latter, the pattern of stresses varies often from the iambic norm, the syntax is unsym- metrical, and the couplets run on freely, with the rhyme serving to color rather than to stop the verse. See George Williamson, \"The Rhetorical Pattern of Neoclassical Wit,\" Modem Philology 33 (1935); W K. Wimsatt, \"One Relation of Rhyme to Reason (Alexander Pope),\" in The Verbal Icon (1954); William Bowman Piper, The Heroic Couplet (1969). Heroic Drama was a form mainly specific to the Restoration Period, though instances continued to be written in the early eighteenth century. As John Dryden defined it: \"An heroic play ought to be an imitation; in little, of an 1 1 6 HUMANISM heroic poem; and consequently . . . love and valour ought to be the subject of it\" (Preface to The Conquest of Granada, 1672). By \"heroic poem\" he meant epic, and the plays attempted to emulate the epic by employing as protagonist a large-scale warrior whose actions involve the fate of an empire, and by hav\u00ad ing all the characters speak in an elevated and elaborate style, usually cast in the epigrammatic form of the closed heroic couplet A noble hero and heroine are typically represented in a situation in which their passionate love conflicts with the demands of honor and with the hero's patriotic duty to his country; if the conflict ends in disaster, the play is called an heroic tragedy. Often the central dilemma is patently contrived and the characters seem to modern readers to be statuesque and unconvincing, while the attempt to sustain a high epic style swells sometimes into bombast, as in Dryden's Love Triumphant (1693): \"What woods are these? I feel my vital heat / Forsake my limbs, my curdled blood retreat.\" Dryden is the major writer of this dramatic form; The Conquest of Granada is one of the better heroic tragedies, but the most successful achievement is All for Love (1678), which is an adaptation to the heroic formula of Shake\u00ad speare's Antony and Cleopatra. Other heroic dramatists were Nathaniel Lee (The Rival Queens) and Thomas Otway, whose Venice Preserved is a fine tragedy that transcends the limitations of the form. We also owe indirectly to heroic tragedy two very amusing parodies of the type: the Duke of Buckingham's The Rehearsal (1672) and Henry Fielding's The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Life and Death of Tom Thumb the Great (1731). See Bonamy C. Kirsch, Dryden's Heroic Drama (1965). Humanism. In the sixteenth century the word humanist was coined to sig\u00ad nify one who taught or worked in the \"studia humanitatis,\" or humanities\u2014 that is, grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry, and moral philosophy, as distinguished from fields less concerned with the moral and imaginative as\u00ad pects and activities of man, such as mathematics, natural philosophy, and theology. At that time, these studies focused on classical, and above all Latin, culture; and they put great emphasis on learning to speak and write good Latin. Scholarly humanists recovered, edited, and expounded many ancient texts in Greek and Latin, and so contributed greatly to the store of materials and ideas in the European Renaissance. These humanists also wrote many works concerned with educational, moral, and political themes, based largely on classical writers such as Aristotle, Plato, and above all, Cicero. In the nine\u00ad teenth century a new word, humanism, came to be applied to the view of human nature, the general values, and the educational ideas common to many Renaissance humanists, as well as to a number of later writers in the same tradition. Typically, Renaissance humanism assumed the dignity and central posi\u00ad tion of human beings in the universe; emphasized the importance in educa\u00ad tion of studying classical imaginative and philosophical literature, although with emphasis on its moral and practical rather than its aesthetic values; and HUMANISM 117 insisted on the primacy, in ordering human life, of reason (considered the dis\u00ad tinctively human faculty) as opposed to the instinctual appetites and the \"an\u00ad imal\" passions. Many humanists also stressed the need for a rounded development of an individual's diverse powers, physical, mental, artistic, and moral, as opposed to a merely technical or specialized kind of training. In our time the term \"humanist\" often connotes those thinkers who base truth on human experience and reason and base values on human nature and culture, as distinct from those who regard religious revelation as the warrant for all truth and values. With few exceptions, however, Renaissance human\u00ad ists were pious Christians who incorporated the concepts and ideals inherited from pagan antiquity into the frame of the Christian creed. The result was that they tended to emphasize the values achievable by human beings in this world, and to minimize the earlier Christian emphasis on the innate corrup\u00ad tion of human beings and on the ideals of asceticism and of withdrawal from this world in a preoccupation with the world hereafter. It has become com\u00ad mon to refer to this synthesis of classical and Christian views, typical of writ\u00ad ers such as Sir Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, and John Milton, as Christian humanism. The rapid advance in the achievements and prestige of the natural sci\u00ad ences and technology after the Renaissance sharpened, in later heirs of the humanistic tradition, the need to defend the role of the humanities in a lib\u00ad eral education against the encroachments of the sciences and the practical arts. As Samuel Johnson, the eighteenth-century humanist who had once been a schoolmaster, wrote in his Life of Milton: The truth is, that the knowledge of external nature, and the sciences which that knowledge requires or includes, are not the great or the fre\u00ad quent business of the human mind. ... We are perpetually moralists, but we are geometricians only by chance.... Socrates was rather of opinion that what we had to learn was, how to do good, and avoid evil. Matthew Arnold, the notable proponent of humanism in the Victorian Period, strongly defended the central role of humane studies in general education. Many of Arnold's leading ideas are adaptations of the tenets of the older hu\u00ad manism\u2014his view, for example, that culture is a perfection \"of our humanity proper, as distinguished from our animality,\" and consists of \"a harmonious expansion of all the powers which make the beauty and worth of human na\u00ad ture\"; his emphasis on knowing \"the best that is known and thought in the world,\" with the assumption that much of what is best is in the writings of classical antiquity; and his conception of poetry as essentially \"a criticism of life.\" In the 1890s the German philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey developed a highly influential distinction between the natural sciences, which aim at a re\u00ad ductive \"explanation\" of the world, and the \"human sciences\" (the humani\u00ad ties), which aim to achieve an \"understanding\" of the full, concrete world of actual experience\u2014the lived human world, for example, that is represented in works of literature. (See in the entry Interpretation and Hermeneutics.) 1 1 8 HUMANISM In our own century the American movement of 1910-33 known as the New Humanism, under the leadership of Irving Babbitt and Paul Elmer More, argued strongly for a return to a primarily humanistic education, and for a very conservative view of moral, political, and literary values that is grounded mainly on classical literature. (See Irving Babbitt, Literature and the American College, 1908; and Norman Foerster, ed., Humanism and America, 1930.) But in the present age of proliferating demands for specialists in the sciences, technology, and the practical arts, the broad humanistic base for a general education has been greatly eroded. In most colleges the earlier hu\u00ad manistic view of education survives mainly in the requirement that all stu\u00ad dents in the liberal arts must take at least six hours in the group called the humanities, which comprises literature, philosophy, music, languages, and sometimes history. It is notable that a number of recent structuralist and poststructuralist philosophical and critical theories are expressly antihumanistic, not only in the sense that they undertake to subvert many of the values proposed by tra\u00ad ditional humanism, but in the more radical sense that they undertake to \"de- center,\" or to eliminate entirely, the focus on the human being, or subject, as the major object of study and the major agency in effecting scientific, cul\u00ad tural, and literary achievements. \"Man\" as Michel Foucault has put it in a widely quoted affirmation, \"is a simple fold in our language\" who is destined to \"disappear as soon as that knowledge has found a new form.\" In the realm of literary and critical theory, some structuralists conceive of a human author as simply a \"space\" in which linguistic and cultural codes come together to ef\u00ad fect a text; deconstructionists tend to reduce the human subject to one of the \"effects\" engendered by the differential play of language; and a number of Marxist and new-historicist critics describe the subject as a variable construc\u00ad tion that is produced and positioned by the ideological or cultural \"discursive formations\" that the author-as-subject incorporates and transmits in his or her own literary product. (See poststucturalism.) A number of feminists, gay and lesbian critics, and proponents of ethnic multiculturalism are adherents of \"identity politics,\" and stake out a position which differs from both the hu\u00ad manistic and poststructural views of the nature and valid role of the human subject. Like traditional humanists, identity theorists reject the extreme poststructural claims that the human subject is no more than a social con\u00ad struction or textual effect, and replace the subject\u2014as a particular sexual, gender-specific, or ethnic identity\u2014at the center of the scene of writing, in\u00ad terpretation, and political action. In opposition to traditional humanists, on the other hand, identity theorists emphasize the identity of the subject as a representative of one or another group, rather than as a representative of uni\u00ad versal humanity. (On current conflicts about \"identity\" see Jonathan Culler, Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction, 1997, Chapter 8; also refer to the en\u00ad tries in this Glossary on feminist criticism, postcolonial studies, and queer theory.)

For opposition to such views and defenses of the humanist position in authorship, interpretation, and criticism, see Richard Levin, \"Bashing the Bourgeois Subject,\" in Textual Practice 3 (1989); Clara Claiborne Park, Rejoining the Common Reader (1991); M. H. Abrams, \"What Is a Humanis\u00ad tic Criticism?\" in The Emperor Redressed: Critiquing Critical Theory, ed. Dwight Eddins (1995); Richard A. Etlin, In Defense of Humanism: Value in Arts and Let\u00ad ters (1996); Alvin Kernan, ed., What's Happened to the Humanities? (1997). Hymn in current usage denotes a song that celebrates God or expresses reli\u00ad gious feelings and is intended primarily to be sung as part of a religious serv\u00ad ice. (See lyric.) The term derives from the Greek hymnos, which originally signified songs of praise that were for the most part addressed to the gods, but in some instances to human heroes or to abstract concepts. The early Chris\u00ad tian Churches, following classical examples, introduced the singing of hymns as part of the liturgy; some of these consisted of the texts or paraphrases of Old Testament psalms, but others were composed as songs of worship by churchly authors of the time. The writing of religious lyric poems set to music continued through the Middle Ages and into the Protestant Reformation; Martin Luther himself (1483-1546) composed both the German words and the music of hymns, including \"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God,\" which is now sung by most Christian denominations. The writing of religious hymns, some of them metrical versions of the psalms and others original, continued through the Renaissance and was sup\u00ad plemented by a revival of \"literary hymns\" on secular or even pagan sub\u00ad jects\u2014a classical type which had been kept alive through the Middle Ages by a number of neo-Latin poets, and was now composed to be read rather than sung. Edmund Spenser's Fowre Hymns (1596) are distinguished examples of such literary hymns; the first two celebrate earthly love and beauty, and the second two celebrate heavenly (that is, Christian) love and beauty. The tradi\u00ad tion of writing hymns on secular subjects continued into the nineteenth cen\u00ad tury, and produced such examples as James Thomson's \"Hymn of Pan\"; the last three of these hymns, it should be noted, like many of the original Greek hymns, are addressed to pagan gods. The secular hymns were often long and elaborate compositions that verged closely upon another form of versified praise, the ode. These hymns, as well as many religious instances such as the great \"Hymn\" that constitutes all but the brief introduction of Milton's \"On the Morning of Christ's Nativity\" (1629), were formal compositions that were intended only to be read. The short religious lyric written for public singing was revived, and developed into its modern form, by the notable eighteenth-century hymnists of personal religious emotions, including Isaac Watts, Charles and John Wesley, and 1 20 HYPERBOLE AND UNDERSTATEMENT William Cowper; a successor in the next century was John Henry Newman, author of \"Lead, Kindly Light.\" In America the poets John Greenleaf Whittier, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote hymns, but the greatest and best-known American devotional songs are the anonymous African-American type that we call spirituals, such as \"Swing Low, Sweet Char\u00ad iot\" and \"Go Down, Moses.\" See James Weldon Johnson and J. Rosamond Johnson, Book of American Negro Spirituals (1925-26), and the New Oxford Book of Christian Verse, ed. Don\u00ad ald Davie (1982); and refer to: C. S. Phillipe, Hymnody Past and Present (1937); Louis F. Benson, The English Hymn (1962); P. S. Diehl, The Medieval European Religious Lyric (1985); and the article \"Hymn\" in The New Princeton Encyclope\u00ad dia of Poetry and Poetics (1993). Hyperbole and Understatement. The figure of speech, or trope, called hyperbole (Greek for \"overshooting\") is bold overstatement, or the extrava\u00ad gant exaggeration of fact or of possibility. It may be used either for serious or ironic or comic effect. Iago says gloatingly of Othello (III. iii. 330 ff.): Not poppy nor mandragora, Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world, Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou ow'dst yesterday. Famed examples in the seventeenth century are Ben Jonson's gallantly hyper\u00ad bolic compliments to his lady in \"Drink to me only with thine eyes,\" and the ironic hyperboles in \"To His Coy Mistress,\" by which Andrew Marvell attests how infinitely slowly his \"vegetable love should grow\"\u2014if he had \"but world enough and time.\" The \"tall talk\" or tall tale of the American West is a form of mainly comic hyperbole. There is the story of a cowboy in an eastern restaurant who ordered a steak well done. \"Do you call this well done?\" he roared at the waitress. \"I've seen critters hurt worse than that get well!\" The contrary figure is understatement (the Greek term is meiosis, \"less\u00ad ening\"), which deliberately represents something as very much less in magni\u00ad tude or importance than it really is, or is ordinarily considered to be. The effect is usually ironic\u2014savagely ironic in Jonathan Swift's A Tale of a Tub, \"Last week I saw a woman flayed, and you will hardly believe how much it altered her per\u00ad son for the worse,\" and comically ironic in Mark Twain's comment that \"The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated.\" Some critics extend \"meiosis\" to the use in literature of a simple, unemphatic statement to enhance the effect of a deeply pathetic or tragic event; an example is the line at the close of the nar\u00ad rative in Wordsworth's Michael (1800): \"And never lifted up a single stone.\" A special form of understatement is litotes (Greek for \"plain\" or \"sim\u00ad ple\"), the assertion of an affirmative by negating its contrary: \"He's not the brightest man in the world\" meaning \"He is stupid.\" The figure is frequent in Anglo-Saxon poetry, where the effect is usually one of grim irony. In Beowulf, after Hrothgar has described the ghastly mere where the monster Grendel dwells, he comments, \"That is not a pleasant place.\" IMAGERY 121 Imagery. This term is one of the most common in criticism, and one of the most variable in meaning. Its applications range all the way from the \"mental pictures\" which, it is sometimes claimed, are experienced by the reader of a poem, to the totality of the components which make up a poem. Examples of this range of usage are C. Day Lewis' statements, in his Poetic Image (1948), pp. 17-18, that an image \"is a picture made out of words,\" and that \"a poem may itself be an image composed from a multiplicity of images.\" Three dis- criminable uses of the word, however, are especially frequent; in all these senses imagery is said to make poetry concrete, a opposed to abstract: (1) \"Imagery\" (that is, \"images\" taken collectively) is used to signify all the objects and qualities of sense perception referred to in a poem or other work of literature, whether by literal description, by allusion, or in the vehicles (the secondary references) of its similes and metaphors. In William Wordsworth's \"She Dwelt among the Untrodden Ways\" (1800), the imagery in this broad sense includes the literal objects the poem refers to (for example, \"untrodden ways,\" \"springs,\" \"grave\"), as well as the \"violet\" of the metaphor and the \"star\" of the simile in the second stanza. The term \"image\" should not be taken to imply a visual reproduction of the object referred to; some readers of the pas\u00ad sage experience visual images and some do not; and among those who do, the explicitness and details of the pictures vary greatly. Also, \"imagery\" in this usage includes not only visual sense qualities, but also qualities that are auditory, tactile (touch), thermal (heat and cold), olfactory (smell), gustatory (taste), and kinesthetic (sensations of movement). In his In Memor\u00ecam (1850), No. 101, for example, Ten\u00ad nyson's imagery encompasses not only things that are visible, but also qualities that are smelled or heard, together with a suggestion, in the adjective \"summer,\" of warmth: Unloved, that beech will gather brown,... And many a rose-carnation feed With summer spice the humming air.... (2) Imagery is used, more narrowly, to signify only specific descriptions of visible objects and scenes, especially if the description is vivid and par\u00ad ticularized, as in this passage from Marianne Moore's \"The Steeple-Jack\": a sea the purple of the peacock's neck is* paled to greenish azure as D\u00fcrer changed the pine tree of the Tyrol to peacock blue and guinea grey. (3) Commonly in recent usage, imagery signifies figurative language, espe\u00ad cially the vehicles of metaphors and similes. Critics after the 1930s, and notably the New Critics, went far beyond earlier commentators in stressing imagery, in this sense, as the essential component in poetry, and as a major factor in poetic meaning, structure, and effect. * Lines from \"The Steeplejack\" by Marianne Moore, from The Complete Poems of Marianne Moore.

Following the lead of several earlier critics, she also pointed out the frequent occurrence in Shakespeare's plays of image-clusters (recurrent groupings of seemingly unre\u00ad lated metaphors and similes). She also presented evidence that a number of the individual plays have characteristic image motifs (for example, animal im\u00ad agery in King Lear, and the figures of disease, corruption, and death in Ham\u00ad let)) her view was that these elements established the overall tonality of a play. Many critics in the next few decades joined Spurgeon in the search for im\u00ad ages, image clusters, and \"thematic imagery\" in works of literature. By some New Critics the implicit interaction of the imagery\u2014in distinction from ex\u00ad plicit statements by the author or the overt speeches and actions of the char\u00ad acters\u2014was held to be the way that the controlling literary subject, or theme, worked itself out in many plays, poems, and novels. See, for example, the crit\u00ad ical writings of G. Wilson Knight, Cleanth Brooks on Macbeth in The Well Wrought Urn (1947), chapter 2, and Robert B. Heilman, This Great Stage: Image and Structure in \"KingLear\" (1948). H. W. Wells, Poetic Imagery (1924); June E. Downey, Creative Imagination (1929); Richard H. Fogle, The Imagery of Keats and Shelley (1949); Norman Friedman, \"Imagery: From Sensation to Symbol, \"Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 12 (1953); Frank Kermode, Romantic Image (1957). Imagism was a poetic vogue that flourished in England, and even more vig\u00ad orously in America, between the years 1912 and 1917. It was planned and ex\u00ad emplified by a group of English and American writers in London, partly under the influence of the poetic theory of T. E. Hulme, as a revolt against what Ezra Pound called the \"rather blurry, messy. . . sentimentalistic mannerish\" po\u00ad etry at the turn of the century. Pound, the first leader of the movement, was soon succeeded by Amy Lowell; after that Pound sometimes referred to the movement, slightingly, as \"Amygism.\" Other leading participants, for a time, were H. D. (Hilda Doolittle), D. H. Lawrence, William Carlos Williams, John Gould Fletcher, and Richard Aldington. The Imagist proposals, as voiced by Amy Lowell in her preface to the first of three anthologies called Some Imagist Poets (1915-17), were for a poetry which, abandoning conventional poetic materials and versification, is free to choose any subject and to create its own rhythms, uses common speech, and presents an image or vivid sensory de\u00ad scription that is hard, clear, and concentrated. (See imagery.) The typical Imagist poem is written in free verse and undertakes to render as precisely and tersely as possible, and without comment or generalization, the writer's impression of a visual object or scene; often the impression is ren\u00ad dered by means of metaphor, or by juxtaposing, without indicating a relation, the description of one object with that of a second and diverse object. This famed example by Ezra Pound exceeds other Imagist poems in the degree of its concentration: IMITATION 123 In a Station of the Metro* The apparition of these faces in the crowd, Petals on a wet, black bough. In this poem Pound, like a number of other Imagists, was influenced by the Japanese haiku. Imagism was too restrictive to endure long as a concerted movement, but it served to inaugurate a distinctive feature of modernist poetry. Almost every major poet from the 1920s through the middle of the present century, includ\u00ad ing W. B. Yeats, T. S. Eliot, and Wallace Stevens, manifests some influence by the Imagist experiments with the representation of precise, clear images that are juxtaposed without specifying their interrelations. See T. E. Hulme, Speculations, ed. Herbert Read (1924); Stanley K. Coff- man, Imagism (1951); The Imagist Poem, ed. William Pratt (1963); Hugh Ken\u00ad ner, The Pound Era (1972). Imitation. In literary criticism the word imitation has two frequent but di\u00ad verse applications: (1) to define the nature of literature and the other arts, and (2) to indicate the relation of one literary work to another literary work which served as its model. (1) In his Poetics, Aristotle defines poetry as an imitation (in Greek, mime\u00ad sis) of human actions. (See criticism.) By \"imitation\" he means some\u00ad thing like \"representation,\" in its root sense: the poem imitates by taking an instance of human action and re-presenting it in a new \"medium,\" or material\u2014that of words. By distinguishing differences in the artistic media, in the kind of actions imitated, and in the man\u00ad ner of imitation (for example, dramatic or narrative), Aristotle first distinguishes poetry from other arts, and then makes distinctions be\u00ad tween the various poetic kinds, such as drama and epic, tragedy and comedy. From the sixteenth through the eighteenth century the term \"imitation\" was a central term in discussing the nature of poetry. Crit\u00ad ics differed radically, however, in their concept of the nature of the mimetic relationship, and of the kinds of things in the external world that works of literature imitate, or ought to imitate, so that theories of imitation varied in the kind of art they recommended, from a strict realism to a remote idealism. With the emergence in the early nine\u00ad teenth century of an expressive criticism (the view that poetry is essen\u00ad tially an expression of the poet's feelings or imaginative process), imitation tended to be displaced from its central position in literary theory (see criticism). In the last half-century, however, the use of the term has been revived, especially by R. S. Crane and other Chicago critics, who ground their theory on the analytic method and basic * Lines from \"In a Station of the Metro\" from Personae by Ezra Pound. Copyright 1926 by Ezra Pound. Reprinted by permission of New Directions Publishing Corporation and Faber & Faber Ltd. 1 24 INFLUENCE AND THE ANXIETY OF INFLUENCE distinctions of Aristotle's Poetics. Many Marxist critics also propose a view of literature as an imitation, or, in their preferred term, \"reflec\u00ad tion,\" of social reality. (2) Ancient rhetoricians and critics often recommended that a poet should \"imitate\" the established models in a particular literary genre. The notion that the proper procedure for poets, with the rare excep\u00ad tion of an \"original genius,\" was to imitate the normative forms and styles of the Greek and Roman masters continued to be influential through the eighteenth century; all the major critics, however, also insisted that mere copying was not enough\u2014that a good literary work must imitate the form and spirit rather than the detail of the classic models, and that success can be achieved only by a poet who possesses an innate poetic talent. In a specialized use of the term in this second sense, \"imitation\" was also used to describe a literary work which deliberately echoed an older work but adapted it to subject matter in the writer's own age, usually in a satirical fash\u00ad ion. In the poems that Alexander Pope called Imitations of Horace (1733 and following), for example, an important part of the intended effects depend on the reader's recognition of the resourcefulness and wit with which Pope ac\u00ad commodated to contemporary circumstances the structure, details, and even the wording of one or another of Horace's Roman satires. On \"imitation\" as a term used to define literature see R. S. Crane, ed., Critics and Criticism (1952); M. H. Abrams, The Minor and the Lamp (1953), chapters 1-2; and Erich Auerbach, Mimesis, translated by Willard Trask (1953). On Pope's \"imitations\" of Horace and other ancient masters see R. A. Brower, Alexander Pope: The Poetry of Allusion (1959). For denials, on various grounds, that literature can be claimed to imitate reality, see Russian formalism, struc\u00ad turalist criticism, deconstruction, new historicism, and text and writing (\u00e9criture). Among modern defenses of the view that literature is mimetic, in the broad sense that it has reference beyond the text to the world of human experience, see Gerald Graff, Literature against Itself {1979); A. D. Nuttall, A New Mimesis: Shakespeare and the Representation of Reality (1983); and Robert Alter, \"Mimesis and the Motives for Fiction,\" in his Motives for Fiction (1984). Influence and the Anxiety of Influence. Critics and historians of litera\u00ad ture have for many centuries dealt with what has been called the influence of one author or literary tradition upon a later author who is said to adopt, and at the same time to alter, aspects of the subject matter, form, or style of the earlier writer or writers. Among traditional topics for discussion, for example, have been the influence of Homer on Virgil, of Virgil on Milton, of Milton on Wordsworth, or of Wordsworth on Wallace Stevens. The anxiety of influence is a phrase used by the influential contemporary critic Harold Bloom to iden\u00ad tify his radical revision of this standard theory that influence consists in a direct \"borrowing,\" or assimilation, of the materials and features found in earlier writers. Bloom's own view is that in the composition of any poem, INFLUENCE AND THE ANXIETY OF INFLUENCE 1 25 influence is inescapable, but that it evokes in the author an anxiety that com\u00ad pels a drastic distortion of the work of a predecessor. He applies this concept of anxiety to the reading as well as the writing of poetry. In Bloom's theory a poet (especially since the time of Milton) is moti\u00ad vated to compose when his imagination is seized upon by a poem or poems of a \"precursor.\" The \"belated\" poet's attitudes to his precursor, like those in Freud's analysis of the Oedipal relation of son to father, are ambivalent; that is, they are compounded not only of admiration but also (since a strong poet feels a compelling need to be autonomous and original) of hate, envy, and fear of the precursor's preemption of the descendant's imaginative space. The belated poet safeguards his sense of his own freedom and priority by reading a parent-poem \"defensively,\" in such a way as to distort it beyond his own conscious recognition. Nonetheless, he cannot avoid embodying the dis\u00ad torted parent-poem into his own hopeless attempt to write an unprecedent- edly original poem; the most that even the best belated poet can achieve is to write a poem so \"strong\" that it effects an illusion of \"priority\"\u2014that is, an il\u00ad lusion that it has escaped the precursor-poem's precedence in time and that it exceeds it in greatness. Bloom identifies six distortive processes which operate in reading a precur\u00ad sor; he calls these processes \"revisionary ratios\" and defines them mainly on the model of Freud's defense mechanisms (see psychoanalytic criticism). He also equates these mechanisms with the devices by which the medieval Kabbalists reinterpreted the Hebrew Bible, as well as with various types of rhetorical tropes (see figurative language). Since in Bloom's view the revisionary ratios are the cat\u00ad egories through which all of us, whether or not we are ourselves poets, neces\u00ad sarily read our precursors, his conclusion is that we can never know \"the poem-in-itself\"; all interpretation is \"a necessary misprision,\" is therefore misprision\u2014or misreading.\" A \"weak misreading\" is an attempt (doomed to fail) to get at what a text really means, while a \"strong misreading\" is one in which an individual reader's defenses are unconsciously licensed to re\u00ad cast in an innovative fashion the text that the reader undertakes to interpret. Since Bloom conceives that \"every poem is a misinterpretation of a par\u00ad ent poem,\" he recommends that literary critics boldly practice what he calls antithetical criticism\u2014that is, that they learn \"to read any poem as its poet's deliberate misinterpretation, as a poet, of a precursor poem or of poetry in general.\" The results of such strong readings will be antithetical both to what the poet himself thought he meant and to what standard weak misreadings have made out the poem to mean. In his own powerfully individualistic writ\u00ad ings, Bloom applies such antithetical criticism to poets ranging from the eigh\u00ad teenth century through the major Romantics to Yeats and Stevens. He is aware that, in terms of his theory, his own interpretations both of poets and critics are necessarily misreadings. His claim is that his antithetical interpreta\u00ad tions are strong, and therefore \"interesting,\" misreadings, and so will take their place in the accumulation of misreadings which constitutes the history both of poetry and of criticism, at least since the seventeenth century\u2014al\u00ad though this history is bound to be tragic, since as time goes on there will be a 1 26 INTENTIONAL FALLACY constant decrease in the area of imaginative possibilities that are left open to poets. A precursor of Bloom's theory was Walter Jackson Bate's The Burden of the Past and the English Poet (1970), which described the struggles by poets, since 1660, to overcome the inhibitive effect of fear that their predecessors might have exhausted all the possibilities of writing great original poems. Bloom presented his own theory of reading and writing poetry in The Anxiety of In\u00ad fluence (1973), then elaborated the theory, and demonstrated its application to diverse poetic texts, in three rapidly successive books, A Map of Misreading (1975), Kabbalah and Criticism (1975), and Poetry and Repression (1976), as well as in a number of writings concerned with individual poets. See also the col\u00ad lection of Bloom's writings, Poetics of Influence, ed. John Hollander (1988). For analyses and critiques of this theory of literature see Frank Lentricchia, After the New Criticism (1980), chapter 9; David Fite, Harold Bloom: The Rhetoric of Romantic Vision (1985); M. H. Abrams, \"How to Do Things with Texts,\" in Doing Things with Texts (1989). Bloom proposed his theory, it will have been noted, with respect to male poets; for an application of the anxiety of influ\u00ad ence to women writers, see Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, The Madwoman in the Attic (1980), discussed in the entry feminist criticism. Intentional Fallacy signifies what is claimed to be the error of interpreting and evaluating a literary work by reference to evidence, outside the text itself, for the intention\u2014the design and purposes\u2014of its author. The term was pro\u00ad posed by W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe C. Beardsley in \"The Intentional Fallacy\" (1946), reprinted in Wimsatt's The Verbal Icon (1964). They asserted that an author's intended aims and meanings in writing a literary work\u2014whether these are asserted by the author or merely inferred from our knowledge of the author's life and opinions\u2014are irrelevant to the literary critic, because the meaning, structure, and value of a text are inherent within the finished, free\u00ad standing, and public work of literature itself. Reference to the author's sup\u00ad posed purposes, or else to the author's personal situation and state of mind in writing a text, is held to be a harmful mistake, because it diverts our attention to such \"external\" matters as the author's biography, or psychological condi\u00ad tion, or creative process, which we substitute for the proper critical concern with the \"internal\" constitution and inherent value of the literary product. (See objective criticism, under criticism.) This claim, which was central in the New Criticism, has been strenuously debated, and was reformulated by both of its original proponents. (See Wim\u00ad satt, \"Genesis: An Argument Resumed,\" in Day 1976; and Beardsley, Aesthetics, 1958, pp. 457-61, and The Possibility of Criticism, 1970, pp. 16-37.) A view acceptable to many traditional critics (but not to struc\u00ad turalist and poststructuralist theorists) is that in the exceptional instances\u2014for example, in Henry James' prefaces to his novels\u2014where we possess an au\u00ad thor's express statement about his artistic intentions in a literary work, that statement should constitute evidence for an interpretive hypothesis, but should not in itself be determinative. If the author's stated intentions do not INTERPRETATION AND HERMENEUTICS 1 27 accord with the text, they should be qualified or rejected in favor of an alter\u00ad native interpretation that conforms more closely to the shared, or \"public,\" linguistic and literary conventions that the text itself incorporates. Compare affective fallacy. For diverse views of the role of authorial inten\u00ad tions in establishing a text and in interpreting the meanings of a text, see in\u00ad terpretation and hermeneutics and textual criticism. A detailed objection to Wimsatt and Beardsley's original essay is E. D. Hirsch's \"Objective Interpreta\u00ad tion\" (1960), reprinted as an appendix to his Validity in Interpretation (1967). An anthology of discussions of this topic in criticism is David Newton-de Molina, On Literary Intention (1976). Ronald Dworkin discusses parallels be\u00ad tween the role of intention in legal interpretation and literary interpretation, in \"Law as Interpretation,\" The Politics of Interpretation, ed. W. J. T. Mitchell (1983). Interpretation and Hermeneutics. In the narrow sense, to interpret a work of literature is to specify the meanings of its language by analysis, para\u00ad phrase, and commentary; usually such interpretation focuses on especially obscure, ambiguous, or figurative passages. In a broader sense, to interpret a work of literature is to make clear the artistic features and purport in the over\u00ad all work of which language serves as the medium. Interpretation in this sense includes the analysis of such matters as the work's genre, component ele\u00ad ments, structure, theme, and effects (see criticism). The term hermeneutics originally designated the formulation of princi\u00ad ples of interpretation that apply specifically to the Bible; the principles incor\u00ad porated both the rules governing a valid reading of the biblical text, and exegesis, or commentary on the application of the meanings expressed in the text. Since the nineteenth century, however, \"hermeneutics\" has come to des\u00ad ignate the theory of interpretation in general\u2014that is, a formulation of the principles and methods involved in getting at the meaning of all written texts, including legal, historical, and literary, as well as biblical texts. The German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher, in a series of lectures in 1819, was the first to frame a theory of \"general hermeneutics\" as \"the art of understanding\" texts of every kind. Schleiermacher's views were devel\u00ad oped in the 1890s by the influential philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911), who proposed a science of hermeneutics designed to serve as the basis for in\u00ad terpreting all forms of writing in the \"human sciences\": that is, in the hu\u00ad manities and the social sciences, as distinguished from the natural sciences. Dilthey regarded the human sciences as ways of dealing with the temporal, concrete, \"lived experience\" of human beings. He proposed that whereas the aim of the natural sciences is to achieve \"explanation\" by means of static, reductive categories, the aim of hermeneutics is to establish a general theory of \"understanding.\" The understanding of a verbal text consists in \"the interpretation of works, works in which the texture of inner life comes fully to expression.\" And in literature above all, \"the inner life of man finds its complex, exhaustive, and objectively intelligible expression.\" (See human\u00ad ism.) 1 28 INTERPRETATION AND HERMENEUTICS In formulating the way in which we come to understand the meaning of a text, Dilthey gave the name the hermeneutic circle to a procedure Schleier\u00ad macher had earlier described. That is, in order to understand the determinate meanings of the verbal parts of any linguistic whole, we must approach the parts with a prior sense of the meaning of the whole; yet we can know the meaning of the whole only by knowing the meanings of its constituent parts. This circularity of the interpretive process applies to the interrelations be\u00ad tween the single words within any sentence and the sentence as a whole, as well as to interrelations between all the single sentences and the work as a whole. Dilthey maintained that the hermeneutic circle is not a vicious circle, in that we can achieve a valid interpretation by a mutually qualifying inter\u00ad play between our evolving sense of the whole and our retrospective under\u00ad standing of its component parts. Interest in the theory of interpretation revived strongly in the 1950s and 1960s, concurrently with the turn of Western philosophy to focus on the uses and meanings of language, and the turn of literary criticism\u2014exemplified by the New Criticism in America\u2014to the conception of a literary work as a lin\u00ad guistic object and to the view that the primary task of criticism is to interpret its verbal meanings and their interrelations. There have been two main lines of development in recent hermeneutics: (1) One development, represented notably by the Italian theorist Emilio Betti and the American E. D. Hirsch, takes off from Dilthey's claim that a reader is able to achieve an objective interpretation of an au\u00ad thor's expressed meaning. In his Validity in Interpretation (1967), fol\u00ad lowed by The Aims of Interpretation (1976), Hirsch asserts that \"a text means what its author meant,\" specifies that this meaning is \"the ver\u00ad bal meaning which an author intends,\" and undertakes to show that such verbal meaning is in principle determinate (even if in some in\u00ad stances determinately ambiguous, or multiply significant), that it re\u00ad mains stable through the passage of time, and that it is in principle reproducible by each competent reader. The author's verbal inten\u00ad tion is not the author's state of consciousness at the time of writing, but only the intention-to-mean something which, by making use of preexisting linguistic conventions and norms, gets actualized in words, and so may be shared by readers who are competent in the same conventions and norms and know how to apply them in their interpretive practice. If a text is read independently of reference to the author's intentions, Hirsch asserts, it remains indeterminate\u2014 that is, capable of an indefinite diversity of meanings. A reader arrives at a determinate interpretation by using an implicit logic of valida\u00ad tion (capable of being made explicit by the hermeneutic theorist), which serves to specify the author's intention, by reference not only to the general conventions and norms of a language, but also to all evidence, whether internal or external to the text, concerning \"rele\u00ad vant aspects in the author's outlook\" or \"horizon.\" Relevant external INTERPRETATION AND HERMENEUTICS references include the author's cultural milieu and personal prepos\u00ad sessions, as well as the literary and generic conventions that were available to the author at the time when the work was composed. Hirsch reformulates Dilthey's concept of the hermeneutic circle as follows: a competent reader forms an \"hypothesis\" as to the mean\u00ad ing of a part or whole of a text which is \"corrigible\"\u2014that is, the hy\u00ad pothesis can be either confirmed or disconfirmed by continuing reference to the text; if disconfirmed, it is replaced by an alternative hypothesis which conforms more closely to all the components of the text. Since the interpreted meanings of the components of a text are to some degree constituted by the hypotheses one brings to their interpretation, such a procedure can never achieve absolute certainty as to a text's correct meaning. The most a reader can do is to arrive at the most probable meaning of a text; but this logic of highest proba\u00ad bility, Hirsch insists, is adequate to yield objective knowledge, con- firmable by other competent readers, concerning the determinate and stable meanings both of the component passages and of the artis\u00ad tic whole in a work of literature. Hirsch follows traditional hermeneutics in making an essential distinction between verbal meaning and significance. The signifi\u00ad cance of a text to a reader is the relation of its verbal meaning to other matters, such as the personal situation, beliefs, and responses of the individual reader, or the prevailing cultural milieu of the reader's own era, or a particular set of concepts or values, and so on. The ver\u00ad bal meaning of a text, Hirsch asserts\u2014the meaning intended by the writer\u2014is determinate and stable; its significance, however\u2014what makes the text alive and resonant for diverse readers in diverse times\u2014is indeterminate and ever-changing. Verbal meaning is the particular concern of hermeneutics; textual significance, in its many aspects, is one of the concerns of literary criticism. (2) The second line of development in recent hermeneutics takes off from Dilthey's view that the genuine understanding of literary and other humanistic texts consists in the reader's re-experience of the \"inner life\" that the texts express. A primary thinker in this develop\u00ad ment is Martin Heidegger, whose Being and Time (1927, trans. 1962) incorporated the act of interpretation into an existential philoso\u00ad phy\u2014that is, a philosophy centered on \"Dasein,\" or what it is to-be- in-the-world. Heidegger's student Hans Georg Gadamer adapted an influential theory of textual interpre\u00ad tation, Truth and Method (1960, trans. 1975). The philosophical prem\u00ad ise is that temporality and historicality\u2014a situation in one's present that looks back to the past and anticipates the future\u2014is inseparably a part of each individual's being; that the process of understanding something, involving an act of interpretation, goes on not only in reading verbal texts but in all aspects of human experience; and that language, like temporality, pervades all aspects of that experience. In INTERPRETATION AND HERMENEUTICS applying these philosophical assumptions to the understanding of a literary text, Gadamer translates the traditional hermeneutic circle into the metaphors of dialogue and fusion. Readers bring to a text a \"pre-understanding,\" which is constituted by their own temporal and personal \"horizons.\" They should not, as \"subjects,\" attempt to ana\u00ad lyze and dissect the text as an autonomous \"object.\" Instead the reader, as an \"I,\" situated in his present time, addresses questions to the text as a \"Thou,\" but with a receptive openness that simply allows the matter of the text\u2014by means of their shared heritage of lan\u00ad guage\u2014to speak in responsive dialogue, and to readdress its own questions to the reader. The understood meaning of the text is an event which is always the product of a \"fusion of the horizons\" that a reader brings to the text and that the text brings to the reader. Gadamer insists that (unlike most theories of interpretation) this hermeneutics is not an attempt to establish norms or rules for a cor\u00ad rect interpretation, but an attempt simply to describe how we in fact succeed in understanding texts. Nonetheless his theory has the con\u00ad sequence that the search for a determinate meaning of a text which remains stable through the passage of time becomes a will-o'-the- wisp. Since the meaning of a text \"is always codetermined\" by the particular temporal and personal horizon of the individual reader, there cannot be one stable \"right interpretation\"; the meaning of a text is always to an important extent its meaning that it has here, now, for me. To Gadamer's view that the historical and personal rela\u00ad tivity of meaning is inescapable, Hirsch replies that a reader in the present, by reconstructing the linguistic, literary, and cultural condi\u00ad tions of its author, is often able adequately to determine the original and unchanging verbal meaning intended by the writer of a text in the past; and that insofar as Gadamer is right about the unbridgeable gap between the meaning of a text then and its meaning now, he is referring to the ever-alterable \"significance\" contributed by each reader, in his or her time and personal and social circumstances, to the text's stable verbal meaning. Traditional literary critics had tacitly assumed that to interpret a text correctly is to approximate the meaning intended by its author, long before theorists such as Hirsch undertook to define and justify this view. Even the New Critics took for granted that the meaning of a text is the meaning that the author intended; what some of these crit\u00ad ics called the intentional fallacy merely designates the supposed error, in interpreting a text, of employing clues concerning an author's in\u00ad tention which are \"external\" to the \"internal\" realization of that intention in the language of the text itself. Most traditional philoso\u00ad phers, including current \"ordinary language philosophers,\" have also held that to understand an utterance involves reference to the writer's intention, which we infer from our awareness of the writer's linguis\u00ad tic assumptions. H. P. Grice, for example, proposed in the 1950s an INTERPRETATION AND HERMENEUTICS 1 31 influential account of verbal meaning as a speaker's intention in an utterance to produce a specific effect in a hearer, by means of the hearer's recognition of the speaker's intention in making that utter\u00ad ance. (See under discourse analysis.) In Speech Acts (1970), John Searle accepted this description, with the qualification that the speaker can express, and so enable the hearer to recognize, his or her intention only insofar as the expression conforms to the conventions or rules of their common language. In a later refinement of this view, Searle makes a distinction between the speaker's intention which deter\u00ad mines the kind and meaning of a speech act, and the speaker's inten\u00ad tion to communicate that meaning to a hearer; see his Intentionality (1983), chapter 6. On this issue in ordinary-language philosophy, see also P. F. Strawson, \"Intention and Convention in Speech Acts,\" in Jay F. Rosenberg and Charles Travis, eds., Readings in the Philosophy of Language (1971). A radical departure from the traditional author-oriented views of a determinate intended meaning occurs in a number of structural and poststructural theories. (See author and authorship.) Some theorists, re\u00ad jecting any control of interpretation by reference to an author, or sub\u00ad ject, and his or her intention, insist that the meanings of a text are rendered \"undecidable\" by the self-conflicting workings of language itself, or alternatively that meanings are entirely relative to the partic\u00ad ular interpretive strategy that is brought into play by the reader. (See deconstruction and reader-response criticism.) Other current theorists, al\u00ad though they may admit that the manifest meanings of a text are spec\u00ad ified by the intentions of the author, regard such meanings merely as disguises, or displacements, of the real meanings, which are the un\u00ad conscious motives and needs of the author, or else the suppressed po\u00ad litical realities and power-relations of the social structure of an historical era. (See psychoanalytic criticism, Marxist criticism, new his- toricism.) Paul Ricoeur has labeled such modes of reading, as exempli\u00ad fied by Nietzsche, Marx, and Freud, the hermeneutics of suspicion, in that they approach a text as a veiled or mystified set of representa\u00ad tions, whose real meaning, or subtext, needs to be deciphered by the knowing reader. In addition to the titles listed above, refer to Richard E. Palmer, Hermeneutics: Interpretation Theory in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer (1969), an informative review of the history and con\u00ad flicting theories of interpretation from the standpoint of an adherent to Gadamer's theory.

Interpretation: Typological and Allegorical. The typological (or fig\u00ad urai) mode of interpreting the Bible was inaugurated by St. Paul and devel\u00ad oped by the early Church Fathers as a way of reconciling the history, prophecy, and laws of the Hebrew Scriptures with the narratives and teach\u00ad ings of the Christian Scriptures. As St. Augustine expressed its principle: \"In the Old Testament the New Testament is concealed; in the New Testament the Old Testament is revealed.\" In typological theory, that is, the key persons, ac\u00ad tions, and events in the Old Testament are viewed as \"figurae\" (Latin for \"fig\u00ad ures\") which are historically real themselves, but also \"prefigure\" those persons, actions, and events in the New Testament that are similar to them in some aspect, function, or relationship. Often the Old Testament figures are called types and their later correlatives in the New Testament are called anti\u00ad types. The Old Testament figure or type is held to be a prophecy or promise of the higher truth that is \"fulfilled\" in the New Testament, according to a plan which is eternally present in the mind of God but manifests itself to human beings only in the two scriptural revelations separated by a span of time. To cite a few of the very many instances of typological interpretation: Adam was said to be a figure (or in alternative terms, a \"type,\" \"image,\" or \"shadow\") of Christ. One of the analogies cited between pr\u00e9figuration and fulfillment was that between the creation of Eve from Adam's rib and the flow of blood from the side of the crucified Christ; another was the analogy be\u00ad tween the tree that bore the fruit occasioning Adam's original sin and the cross which bore as its fruit Christ, the Redeemer of that sin. In a similar fash\u00ad ion the manna provided the children of Israel in the wilderness (Exodus 16) was held to prefigure the Eucharist, and the relation between the Egyptian servant girl Hagar and Sarah (Genesis 16) to prefigure the relation between the earthly Jerusalem of the Old Testament and the heavenly Jerusalem of the New Testament. By some interpreters, elements of New Testament history were represented as in their turn prefiguring the events that will come to be fulfilled in \"the last days\" of Christ's Second Coming and Last Judgment. The allegorical interpretation of the Bible had its roots in Greek and Roman thinkers who treated classical myths as allegorical representations of ab\u00ad stract cosmological, philosophical, or moral truths. (See allegory.) The method was applied to narratives in the Hebrew Scriptures by the Jewish philosopher Philo (died A.D. 50) and was adapted to Christian interpretation by Origen in the third century. The fundamental distinction in the allegorical interpretation of the Bible is between the \"literal\" (or \"historical,\" or \"carnal\") meaning of the text\u2014the historical truth that it specifically signifies\u2014and the additional \"spiri\u00ad tual\" or \"mystical\" or \"allegoric\" meaning that it signifies by analogy. INTERPRETATION: TYPOLOGICAL AND ALLEGORICAL 1 33 The spiritual aspect of a text's literal meaning was often in turn subdi\u00ad vided into two or more levels; some interpreters specified as many as seven, or even twelve levels. By the twelfth century, however, biblical interpreters widely agreed in finding a fourfold meaning in many biblical passages. A typical set of distinctions, as proposed by St. Thomas Aquinas and others, specifies (1) the literal or historical meaning, which is a narrative of what in fact happened; (2) the allegorical meaning proper, which is the New Testa\u00ad ment truth, or else the prophetic reference to the Christian Church, that is signified by a passage in the Old Testament; (3) the tropological meaning, which is the moral truth or doctrine signified by the same passage; and (4) the anagogie meaning, or reference of the passage to Christian eschatology, that is, the events that are to come in \"the last days\" of Christ's judgment and the life after death of individual souls. We can distinguish between the typological and allegorical mode of in\u00ad terpretation by saying that typology is horizontal, in that it relates items in two texts (the Old and New Testaments) that are separated in time, while alle\u00ad gorical interpretation is vertical, in that it uncovers multiple layers of signifi\u00ad cance in a single textual item. The two interpretive methods, however, were often applied simultaneously, and in many instances fused, by biblical ex- egetes. Both methods flourished into the eighteenth century and recur recog\u00ad nizably in later periods. They were employed in sermons and in a great variety of writings on religious matters, and were adapted to iconography\u2014that is, representations of biblical and non-biblical persons and events intended to have allegoric or symbolic significance\u2014in painting and sculpture. Medieval and later poets sometimes adopted the typological and allegorical principles of biblical interpretation in constructing their own writings on religious sub\u00ad jects. Dante, for example, in a letter written in 1319 to his friend and patron Can Grande della Scala, announced that he composed his Divine Comedy to signify a double subject, literal and allegorical, and that the allegorical subject can in turn be subdivided into allegorical, moral, and anagogical meanings. Scholars have analyzed the adaptation of typological and allegorical proce\u00ad dures by many later poets who wrote on religious themes, including Edmund Spenser, George Herbert, John Milton, and (in a late and highly individual re\u00ad vival of the mode) William Blake. In the last half-century, the American scholar D. W. Robertson and others have proposed that not only writings on religious subjects but also many seemingly secular poems of the Middle Ages\u2014including the Roman de la Rose, the works of Chaucer and Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, and medieval love lyrics\u2014were expressly written to incorporate typological and allegorical modes of theolog\u00ad ical and moral references. The validity, however, of extending these interpre\u00ad tive modes to secular literature is strongly disputed; see the suggested readings below. In The Genesis of Secrecy: On the Interpretation ofNanative (1979), the British critic Frank Kermode adapted the ancient interpretive distinction be\u00ad tween carnal and spiritual meanings to his analysis of recent works of prose fiction. 1 34 INVECTIVE \u00b7 IRONY On the various modes of biblical interpretation, see F. W. Farrar, History of Interpretation (1886), Beryl Smalley, The Study of the Bible in the Middle Ages (rev., 1952), and the notable study by Henri de Lubac, Ex\u00e9g\u00e8se M\u00e9di\u00e9vale: les quatre sens de l'\u00e9criture (4 vols., 1959-74, rev., 1993). A classic discussion of typologi\u00ad cal, or figurai, interpretation is Erich Auerbach's \"Figura\" in his Scenes from the Drama of European Literature (1959). Philip Rollinson, in Classical Theories of Al\u00ad legory and Christian Culture (1981), relates early medieval interpretation of the Bible to modes of literary interpretation in classical times. An American appli\u00ad cation in the eighteenth century of the old interpretive modes is Jonathan Ed\u00ad wards' Images or Shadows of Divine Things, ed. Perry Miller (1948). For uses of typological and allegoric materials by various literary authors, see Rosemund Tuve, A Reading of George Herbert (1952) and Allegorical Imagery (1966); J. H. Hagstrum, William Blake: Poet and Painter (1964); J. Alpers, The Poetry of \"The Faerie Queene\" (1967); and the essays on a number of authors in Paul Miner, ed., Literary Uses of Typology (1977). For the extension of typological and alle\u00ad goric methods to the analysis of secular medieval poems, see D. W. Robertson, Jr., \"Historical Criticism,\" in English Institute Essays, 1950, ed. A. S. Downer (1951), and A Preface to Chaucer: Studies in Medieval Perspectives (1962). The va\u00ad lidity of such an extension is debated by several scholars in Critical Approaches to Medieval Literature, ed. Dorothy Bethurum (1960), and by R. S. Crane, \"On Hypotheses in 'Historical Criticism/\" in The Idea of the Humanities (1967, Vol. 2, pp. 236-60). On the application of biblical allegorization to later literary forms see, in addition to Kermode (above), Northrop Frye, The Great Code: The Bible and Literature (1982); and Stephen Prickett, ed., Reading the Text: Biblical Criti\u00ad cism and Literary Theory (1991). Invective is the denunciation of a person by the use of derogatory epithets. Thus Prince Hal, in Shakespeare's 1 Henry IV, calls the corpulent Falstaff \"this sanguine coward, this bedpresser, this horseback-breaker, this huge hill of flesh.\" (In the context of the play, there is in this instance of invective an un\u00ad dertone of affection, as often when friends, secure in an intimacy that guar\u00ad antees they will not be taken literally, resort to derogatory name-calling in the exuberance of their affection.) In his Discourse Concerning Satire (1693), John Dryden described the dif\u00ad ference in efficacy, as a put-down, between the directness of invective and the indirectness of irony, in which a speaker maintains the advantage of cool de\u00ad tachment by leaving it to the circumstances to convert bland compliments into insults: How easy is it to call rogue and villain, and that wittily! But how hard to make a man appear a fool, a blockhead, or a knave, without using any of those opprobrious terms There is ... a vast difference between the slovenly butchering of a man, and the fineness of a stroke that separates the head from the body, and leaves it standing in its place. Irony. In Greek comedy the character called the eiron was a dissembler, who characteristically spoke in understatement and deliberately pretended to be IRONY 135 less intelligent than he was, yet triumphed over the alazon\u2014the self-deceiving and stupid braggart (see in Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism, 1957). In most of the modern critical uses of the term \"irony/' there remains the root sense of dissembling or hiding what is actually the case; not, however, in order to deceive, but to achieve special rhetorical or artistic effects. Verbal irony (which was traditionally classified as one of the tropes) is a statement in which the meaning that a speaker implies differs sharply from the meaning that is ostensibly expressed. The ironic statement usually in\u00ad volves the explicit expression of one attitude or evaluation, but with indica\u00ad tions in the overall speech-situation that the speaker intends a very different, and often opposite, attitude or evaluation. Thus in Canto IV of Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock (1714), after Sir Plume, egged on by the ladies, has stammered out his incoherent request for the return of the stolen lock of hair, the Baron answers: \"It grieves me much,\" replied the Peer again, \"Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain.\" This is a straightforward case of an ironic reversal of the surface statement (of which one effect is to give pleasure to the reader) because there are patent clues, in the circumstances established by the preceding narrative, that the Peer is not in the least aggrieved and does not think that poor Sir Plume has spoken at all well. A more complex instance of irony is the famed sentence with which Jane Austen opens Pride and Prejudice (1813): \"It is a truth univer\u00ad sally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife\"; part of the ironic implication (based on assumptions that Austen assumes the audience shares with her) is that a single woman is in want of a rich husband. Sometimes the use of irony by Pope and other mas\u00ad ters is very complicated: the meaning and evaluations may be subtly qualified rather than simply reversed, and the clues to the ironic counter-meanings under the literal statement\u2014or even to the fact that the author intends the statement to be understood ironically\u2014may be oblique and unobtrusive. That is why recourse to irony by an author tends to convey an implicit compli\u00ad ment to the intelligence of readers, who are invited to associate themselves with the author and the knowing minority who are not taken in by the os\u00ad tensible meaning. That is also why many literary ironists are misinterpreted and sometimes (like Daniel Defoe and Jonathan Swift in the eighteenth cen\u00ad tury) get into serious trouble with the obtuse authorities. Following the intri\u00ad cate and shifting maneuvers of great ironists like Plato, Swift, Austen, or Henry James is a test of skill in reading between the lines. Some literary works exhibit structural irony; that is, the author, instead of using an occasional verbal irony, introduces a structural feature that serves to sustain a duplex meaning and evaluation throughout the work. One com\u00ad mon literary device of this sort is the invention of a naive hero, or else a naive narrator or spokesman, whose invincible simplicity or obtuseness leads him to persist in putting an interpretation on affairs which the knowing reader\u2014who penetrates to, and shares, the implied point of view of the authorial presence 136 IRONY behind the naive persona\u2014just as persistently is called on to alter and correct. (Note that verbal irony depends on knowledge of the fictional speaker's ironic intention, which is shared both by the speaker and the reader; structural irony depends on a knowledge of the author's ironic intention, which is shared by the reader but is not intended by the fictional speaker.) One example of the naive spokesman is Swift's well-meaning but insanely rational and morally ob\u00ad tuse economist who writes the \"Modest Proposal\" (1729) to convert the excess children of the oppressed and poverty-stricken Irish into a financial and gas- tronomical asset. Other examples are Swift's stubbornly self-deceiving and \"Soliloquy the Spanish Cloister\" (1842), and the insane editor, Kinbote, in Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire (1962). A related structural device for sustaining ironic qualification is the use of the fallible narrator, in which the teller of the story is a participant in it. Although such a narrator may be neither stupid, credulous, nor demented, he nevertheless manifests a failure of insight, by viewing and appraising his own motives, and the motives and actions of other characters, through what the reader is intended to recognize as the distorting perspective of the narrator's prejudices and private interests. (See point of view.) In A Rhetoric of Irony (1974) Wayne Booth identifies as stable irony that in which the speaker or author makes available to the reader an assertion or position which, whether explicit or implied, serves as a firm ground for ironi\u00ad cally qualifying or subverting the surface meaning. Unstable irony, on the other hand, offers no fixed standpoint which is not itself undercut by further ironies. The literature of the absurd typically presents such a regression of ironies. At an extreme, as in Samuel Beckett's drama Waiting for Godot (1955) or his novel The Unnamable (1960), there is an endless regress of ironic under- cuttings. Such works suggest a denial that there is any secure evaluative stand\u00ad point, or even any determinable rationale, in the human situation. Sarcasm in common parlance is sometimes used as an equivalent for all forms of irony, but it is far more useful to restrict it only to the crude and taunting use of apparent praise for dispraise: \"Oh, you're God's great gift to women, you are!\" The difference in application of the two terms is indicated by the difference in their etymologies; whereas \"irony\" derives from \"eiron,\" a \"dissembler,\" the Greek verb \"sarkazein,\" \"to tear flesh.\" An added clue to sarcasm is the exaggerated inflection of the speaker's voice. The term \"irony,\" qualified by an adjective, is used to identify various lit\u00ad erary devices and modes of organization: Socratic irony takes its name from the fact that, as he is represented in Plato's dialogues (fourth century B.C.), the philosopher Socrates usually dis\u00ad sembles by assuming a pose of ignorance, an eagerness to be instructed, and a modest readiness to entertain opinions proposed by others; although these, upon his continued questioning, always turn out to be ill-grounded or to lead to absurd consequences. Dramatic irony involves a situation in a play or a narrative in which the audience or reader shares with the author knowledge of present or future IRONY 1 37 circumstances of which a character is ignorant; in that situation, the character unknowingly acts in a way we recognize to be grossly inappropriate to the ac\u00ad tual circumstances, or expects the opposite of what we know that fate holds in store, or says something that anticipates the actual outcome, but not at all in the way that the character intends. Writers of Greek tragedy, who based their plots on legends whose outcome was already known to their audience, made frequent use of this device. Sophocles' Oedipus, for example, is a very complex instance of tragic irony, for the king (\"I, Oedipus, whom all men call great\") engages in a hunt for the incestuous father-murderer who has brought a plague upon Thebes; the object of the hunt turns out (as the audi\u00ad ence, but not Oedipus, has known right along) to be the hunter himself; and the king, having achieved a vision of the terrible truth, penitently blinds him\u00ad self. Dramatic irony occurs also in comedy. A comic example of dramatic irony is the scene in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night (II. v.) in which Malvolio struts and preens in anticipation of a good fortune that the audience knows is based on a fake letter; the dramatic irony is heightened for the audience by Malvolio's ignorance of the presence of the hidden hoaxers, who gleefully comment on his incongruously complacent speech and actions. Cosmic irony (or \"the irony of fate\") is attributed to literary works in which a deity, or else fate, is represented as though deliberately manipulating events so as to lead the protagonist to false hopes, only to frustrate and mock them. This is a favorite structural device of Thomas Hardy. In his Tess of the D'Urbervilles (1891) the heroine, having lost her virtue because of her inno\u00ad cence, then loses her happiness because of her honesty, finds it again only by murder, and having been briefly happy, is hanged. Hardy concludes: \"The President of the Immortals, in Aeschylean phrase, had ended his sport with Tess.\" Romantic irony is a term introduced by Friedrich Schlegel and other German writers of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to desig\u00ad nate a mode of dramatic or narrative writing in which the author builds up the illusion of representing reality, only to shatter it by revealing that the author, as artist, is the creator and arbitrary manipulator of the characters and their actions. The concept owes much to Laurence Sterne's use of a self- conscious and willful narrator in his Tristram Shandy (1759-67). Byron's great narrative poem Don Juan (1819-24) persistently uses this device for ironic and comic effect, letting the reader into the narrator's confidence, and so reveal\u00ad ing the latter to be a fabricator of fiction who is often at a loss for matter to sustain his story and undecided about how to continue it. (See Anne Mellor, English Romantic Irony, 1980.) This type of irony, involving a self-conscious nar\u00ad rator, has become a recurrent mode in the modern form of involuted fiction. A number of writers associated with the New Criticism used \"irony,\" al\u00ad though in a greatly extended sense, as a general criterion of literary value. This use is based largely on two literary theorists. T. S. Eliot praised a kind of \"wit\" (characteristic, in his view, of seventeenth-century metaphysical poets but ab\u00ad sent in the romantic poets) which is an \"internal equilibrium\" that implies the \"recognition,\" in dealing with any one kind of experience, \"of other kinds of 138 IVORY TOWER \u00b7 JEREMIAD experience which are possible.\" (\"Andrew Marvell,\" 1921, in Selected Essays, 1960.) And I. A. Richards defined irony in poetry as an equilibrium of oppos\u00ad ing attitudes and evaluations (Principles of Literary Criticism, 1924, chapter 32): Irony in this sense consists in the bringing in of the opposite, the com\u00ad plementary impulses; that is why poetry which is exposed to it is not of the highest order, and why irony itself is so constantly a characteristic of poetry which is. Such observations were developed by Robert Penn Warren, Cleanth Brooks, and other New Critics into the claim that poems in which the writer commits himself or herself unreservedly to a single attitude or outlook, such as love or admiration or idealism, are of an inferior order because they are vulnerable to the reader's ironic skepticism; the greatest poems, on the other hand, are in\u00ad vulnerable to external irony because they already incorporate the poet's own \"ironic\" awareness of opposite and complementary attitudes. See Robert Penn Warren, \"Pure and Impure Poetry\" (1943), in Critiques and Essays in Criticism, ed. Robert W. Stallman (1949); Cleanth Brooks, \"Irony as a Principle of Struc\u00ad ture\" (1949), in Literary Opinion in America, ed. M. W. Zabel (1951). J. . .

Dyson, The Crazy Fabric, Essays in Irony (1965); Wayne C. Booth, A Rhetoric of Irony (1974). A suggestive and wide-ranging earlier exploration of the mode is S0ren Kierkegaard's The Concept of Irony (1841), trans. Lee M. Capel (1965). Ivory Tower. A phrase taken from the biblical Song of Songs 7:4, in which it is said of the beloved woman, \"Thy neck is as a tower of ivory.\" In the 1830s the French critic Sainte-Beuve applied the phrase \"tour d'ivoire\" to the stance of the poet Alfred de Vigny, to signify his isolation from everyday life and his exalta\u00ad tion of art above all practical concerns. Since then \"ivory tower\" has been fre\u00ad quently employed (usually in a derogatory way) to signify an attitude or a way of life which is indifferent or hostile to practical affairs and the everyday world and, more specifically, to signify a theory and practice of art which insulates it from moral, political, and social concerns or effects. (See Aestheticism.) Jeremiad. A term derived from the Old Testament prophet Jeremiah, who in the seventh century B.C. attributed the calamities of Israel to its violation of the covenant with Jehovah and return to pagan idolatry, denounced with gloomy eloquence its religious and moral iniquities, and called on the people to repent and reform in order that Jehovah might restore them to His favor and renew the ancient covenant. As a literary term, jeremiad is applied to any work which, with a magniloquence like that of the Old Testament prophet (although it may be in secular rather than religious terms), accounts for the misfortunes of an era as a just penalty for great social and moral evils, but usu\u00ad ally holds open the possibility for changes that will bring a happier future. In the Romantic Period, powerful passages in William Blake's \"prophetic poems\" constitute short jeremiads, and the term is often applied to those of LAI \u00b7 LIGHT VERSE 1 39 Thomas Carlyle's writings in which he uses a biblical idiom to denounce the social and economic misdeeds of the Victorian Period and to call for drastic re\u00ad forms. The jeremiad, in its original religious mode, was a familiar genre in the sermons and writings of the Colonial Period in America, at a time when it was a commonplace that the colonies in New England were the \"New Israel\" with which God had covenanted a glorious future. The misfortunes of the col\u00ad onists, accordingly, were attributed to deviations from the divine commands and described as punishments inflicted by God on His chosen people for their own ultimate benefit. In the words of Increase Mather, \"God does not pun\u00ad ish .. . other Nations until they have filled up the Measure of their sins, and then he utterly destroyeth them; but if our Nation forsake the God of their Fa\u00ad thers never so little,\" He punishes us in order \"that so he may prevent our de\u00ad struction\" (The Day of Trouble Is Near, 1674). Since that era the prophetic stance and denunciatory rhetoric of the jeremiad has been manifested by many orators and writers, religious and secular, into the present time. See Sac- van Bercovitch, The American Jeremiad (1978), and George P. Landow, Elegant Jeremiahs: The Sage from Carlyle to Mailer (1986). Lai. A name originally applied to a variety of poems by medieval French writers in the latter twelfth and the thirteenth centuries. Some lais were lyric, but most of them were short narratives written in octosyllabic couplets. Marie de France, who wrote in the French language although probably in England at the court of King Henry II, composed a number of notable poems of this sort; they are called \"Breton lais\" because their narratives are drawn for the most part from Arthurian and other Celtic legends. (\"Breton\" refers to Brittany, which was a Celtic part of France; see chivalric romance.) The Anglicized term Breton lay was applied in the fourteenth century to English poems written on the model of the narratives of Marie de France; they included Sir Orfeo, the Lay ofLaunfal, and Chaucer's \"The Franklin's Tale.\" Later still, lay was used by English poets simply as a synonym for song, or as an archaic word for a fairly short narrative poem (for example by Sir Walter Scott in his Lay of the Last Minstrel, 1805). See Roger S. Loomis, ed., Arthurian Literature in the Middle Ages (1959), and the Introduction by Charles W. Dunn to Lays of Courtly Love, trans. Patricia Terry (1963). Light Verse is a term applied to a great variety of poems that use an ordi\u00ad nary speaking voice and a relaxed manner to treat their subjects gaily, or play\u00ad fully, or wittily, or with good-natured satire. The subjects of light verse need not be in themselves petty or inconsequential; the defining quality is the tone of voice used, and the attitude of the lyric or narrative speaker toward the sub\u00ad ject. Thomas Love Peacock's \"The War Song of Dinas Vawr\" (1829) begins The mountain sheep are sweeter, But the valley sheep are fatter; We therefore deemed it meeter To carry off the latter. 40 LINGUISTICS IN LITERARY CRITICISM And it ends We brought away from battle, And much their land bemoaned them, Two thousand head of cattle, And the head of him who owned them: Ednyfed, king of Dyfed, His head was borne before us; His wine and beasts supplied our feasts, And his overthrow, our chorus. The dispassionate attitude, brisk colloquialism, and pat rhymes convert what could be a matter for epic or tragedy into a comic narrative that qualifies as light verse. Vers de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 (society verse) is the very large subclass of light verse that deals with the relationships, concerns, and doings of polite society. It is often satiric, but in the mode of badinage rather than severity; and when it deals with love it does so as a sexual game, or flirtatiously, or in the mode of elegant and witty compliment, rather than with passion or high seriousness. The tone is usually urbane, the style deft, and the form polished and some\u00ad times contrived with technical virtuosity; most poems using intricate French stanza forms, such as the villanelle, are society verse. Nursery rhymes and other children's verses are another type of light verse. Edward Lear (\"The Jumblies,\" \"The Owl and the Pussy Cat\") and Lewis Carroll (\"Jabberwocky,\" The Hunting of the Snark) made children's nonsense verses into a Victorian specialty. Lear also popularized the five-line limerick, rhyming aabba which, whether in its ribald or decorous mode, is a form of light verse that everyone knows and many of us have practiced. Some other fine artificers of light and society verse are John Skelton (c. 1460-1529), the Cavalier poets of the early seventeenth century, and John Dryden, Matthew Prior, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Alexander Pope, W. S. Gilbert, and Austin Dobson. Modern practitioners include Ezra Pound, W. H. Auden, e. e. cummings, Ogden Nash, Marianne Moore, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Dorothy Parker, Phyllis McGinley, Morris Bishop, John Betjeman, A. R. Amnions, John Updike, and Ishmael Reed. See epigram.

Linguistics in Literary Criticism. Linguistics is the systematic study of the elements of language and the principles governing their combination and organization. An older term for the scientific study of the constitution and history of language was philology\u2014a term that is still sometimes used as syn\u00ad onymous with linguistics. Through the nineteenth century, philology was mainly \"comparative\" (the analysis of similarities and differences within a family of related languages) and \"historical\" (the analysis of the evolution of LINGUISTICS IN LITERARY CRITICISM a family of languages, or of changes within a particular language, over a long course of time). This latter study of the changes in language over a span of time has come to be called diachronic; the important developments in twentieth-century linguistics came with the shift to the synchronic study of the systematic interrelations of the components of a single language at a par\u00ad ticular time. A major contributor to modern synchronic linguistics was Ferdi\u00ad nand de Saussure, a French-speaking Swiss whose lectures on language as a self-sufficient system, delivered 1907-11, were published from students' notes in 1916, three years after Saussure's death; these lectures have been translated as Course in General Linguistics (1916). (See Saussure under semiotics.) Impor\u00ad tant contributions were also made by American \"descriptive\" or \"structural\" linguists, notably Edward Sapir and Leonard Bloomfield, who set out to devise a linguistic theory and vocabulary adequate to analyze, as modes of verbal '\"behavior,\" the current state of various American Indian languages; a basic text in American linguistics is Bloomfield's Language (1933). Both Continental and American linguistics have been applied to the analysis of the distinctive uses of language in literary texts (see Russian formalism and stylistics), and Saussure's concepts and procedures in analyzing a language have been adopted as a model for analyzing the forms and organization of large-scale literary structures (see structuralist criticism). The following linguistic terms and concepts are often employed by cur\u00ad rent critics and theorists of literature. Saussure introduced an important distinction between langue and pa\u00ad role. A parole is any particular meaningful utterance, spoken or written. The langue is the implicit system of elements, of distinctions and oppositions, and of principles of combination, which make it possible, within a language community, for a speaker to produce and the auditor to understand a particu\u00ad lar parole. The linguist's primary concern, in Saussure's view, is to establish the nature of the underlying linguistic system, the langue. Noam Chomsky has substituted for Saussure's langue and parole the distinction between com\u00ad petence (the tacit knowledge on the part of native speakers who have mas\u00ad tered, or \"internalized,\" the implicit conventions and rules of a language system which make possible the production and understanding of well- formed and meaningful sentences) and performance (the actual utterance of particular sentences). Competent speakers know how to produce such sen\u00ad tences, without being able to specify the conventions and rules that enable them to do so; the function of the linguist is to identify and make explicit the system of linguistic conventions and rules that the speaker unknowingly puts into practice. Modern linguists commonly distinguish three aspects that together con\u00ad stitute the grammar\u2014the components and the principles of ordering the components\u2014in any \"natural language\" (e.g., English, French, Japanese, and so on): (1) phonology, the study of the elementary speech sounds; (2) mor\u00ad phology, the study of the ordering of speech sounds into the smallest mean\u00ad ingful groups (morphemes and words); and (3) syntax, the study of the way that sequences of words are ordered into phrases, clauses, and sentences. 42 LINGUISTICS IN LITERARY CRITICISM Structural linguists usually represent these three aspects as manifesting paral\u00ad lel principles of distinctions and ordering, although on successively higher and more complex levels of organization. A fourth aspect of language some\u00ad times included within the area of linguistics is semantics, the study of the meaning of words and of the combination of words in phrases, sentences, and larger linguistic units. In the area of semantics, Saussure introduced the ter\u00ad minology of the sign (a single word) as constituted by an inseparable union of signifier (the speech sounds or written marks composing the sign) and signi\u00ad fied (the conceptual meaning of the sign). (1) One branch of phonology is phonetics, the physical description of the elementary speech sounds in all known languages and the way they are produced by the vocal apparatus. The \"phonetic alphabet\" is a standardized set of symbols for representing in written form these speech sounds. Another branch is \"phonemics,\" which deals with phonemes: the smallest units of speech sound which, within any one natural language, are functional\u2014that is, which cannot vary without changing the word of which they are a part into a different word. Thus in the English word represented by the spelling \"pin,\" if we change only the initial speech sound, we get three different words, pin-tin-din; if we change only the medial sound, we get pin-pen-pun; if we change only the final sound, we get pin-pit-pill. From the ma\u00ad trix of such changes, we determine that each of the individual units represented by the spelling p, t, d; i, e, u; and n, t, 1 function as differ\u00ad entiating phonemes within the English language. Each language has its own system of phonemes which both overlaps with and diverges from the phonemic system of any other language. The imperfect suc\u00ad cess that a native speaker of one language, such as German or French, manifests in adapting his habitual pronunciations to the phonemic system of a different language, such as English, is a major feature of what we identify as a \"foreign accent.\" Even within a single language, however, a native speaker will vary the pronunciation of a single phonemic unit within different combinations of speech sounds, and will also vary the pronunciation from one utterance to another. Even greater phonetic differences are apparent between two native speakers, especially if they speak the di\u00ad alects of diverse regions, or of diverse social groups. Saussure pro\u00ad posed the principle that what we identify as \"the same phoneme\" within a language is not determined by the physical features of the speech sound itself, but by its difference from all other phonemes in that language\u2014that is, by the differentiability, within a given lan\u00ad guage, between a particular speech unit and all other functional speech units. Saussure's important claim is that the principle of dif\u00ad ference, rather than any \"positive\" property, functions to establish identity not only for phonemes, but for units on all levels of linguis\u00ad tic organization, including both signs and the concepts that the signs LINGUISTICS IN LITERARY CRITICISM signify. All these types of items, then, are systemic facts that achieve an identity only within a particular language, and vary between one language and another. (This claim, that seeming identities are in fact constituted by networks of differences, has been adopted and gener\u00ad alized as a central feature in structuralism, semiotics, and deconstruc- tion.) (2) The next level phonology, is morphology\u2014the com\u00ad bination of phonemes into morphemes and into words. A mor\u00ad pheme is the smallest meaningful unit of speech sounds within any one language; that is, a morphemic unit, composed of one or more phonemes, is a unit that recurs in a language with the same, or at least similar, meaning. Some morphemes, such as \"man,\" \"open,\" and \"run\" in English, constitute complete words; others, however, occur only as parts of words. For example the noun \"grace\" is a word that is a single morpheme. If we prefix to the root element, \"grace,\" the morpheme \"dis-,\" it becomes a different word with a sharply dif\u00ad ferent meaning: \"disgrace\"; if we add to the root the morphemic suf\u00ad fix \"-ful,\" the noun functions as an adjective, \"graceful\"; if we add to these two morphemes the further suffix, \"-ly,\" the resulting word functions as an adverb, \"gracefully\"; if we prefix to this form either the morphemic \"dis-\" or \"un-,\" we get the adverbial words, each com\u00ad posed of four morphemes, \"disgracefully\" and \"ungracefully.\" We find also an interesting set of phoneme combinations which do not constitute specific morphemes, yet are experienced by speak\u00ad ers of English as having a common, though very loose-boundaried, area of meaning. Examples are the initial sounds represented by \"fl-\" in the set of words \"flash, flare, flame, flicker, flimmer,\" all of which signify a kind of moving light; while in the set \"fly, flip, flap, flop, flit, flutter,\" the same initial sounds all signify a kind of movement in air. The terminal sounds represented by \"-ash,\" as they occur in the set \"bash, crash, clash, dash, flash, gash, mash, slash,\" have an overlap\u00ad ping significance of sudden or violent movement. Such combinations of phonemes are sometimes called \"phonetic intensives,\" or else in\u00ad stances of sound-symbolism; they are important components in the type of words, exploited especially by poets, in which the sounds of the words seem peculiarly appropriate to their significance. See onomato\u00ad poeia, and refer to Leonard Bloomfield, Language (1933), pp. 244-46; I. A. Richards, The Philosophy of Rhetoric (1936), pp. 57-65. Phonemes, morphemes, and words are all said to be \"segments\" of the stream of the speech sounds which constitute an utterance. Linguists also distinguish suprasegmental features of language, con\u00ad sisting of stress, juncture, and intonation, all of which function mor- phemically, in that they alter the identity and significance of the segments in an utterance. A shift in stress\u2014that is, of relative force- fulness, or loudness, of a component element in an utterance\u2014from the first to the second syllable converts the noun \"invalid\" into the 1 44 LINGUISTICS IN LITERARY CRITICISM adjective \"invalid/' and the noun \"convict\" into the verb \"convict.\" Juncture denotes the transition in an utterance between adjacent speech sounds, whether within a word, between words, or between groups of words. Linguists distinguish various functional classes of junctures in English utterances. Intonation is the variation of pitch, or voice-melody, in the course of an utterance. We utter the assertion \"He is going home\" with a different intonation from that of the ques\u00ad tion \"Is he going home?\"; and the use of the question intonation even with the assertive sequence of words \"He is going home?\" will make the sentence function to an auditor not as an assertion, but as a question. Uttering the following three words so as to alter the relative stress in the ways indicated, and at the same time using a variety of intonational patterns and pauses, will reveal the extent to which suprasegmental features can affect the significance of a sentence con\u00ad stituted by the same you.\" \"I like you.\" (3) The third level of analysis (after the level of phonemes and the level of the combination of phonemes into morphemes and words) is syn\u00ad tax: the combination of words into phrases, clauses, and sentences. Analysis of speech performances (paroles) in any language reveals reg\u00ad ularities in such constructions, which are explained by postulating syntactic rules that are operative within the linguistic system, or langue, which has been mastered by competent speakers and audi\u00ad tors. (These purely \"descriptive\" rules, or general regularities, of syn\u00ad tax are to be distinguished from the \"prescriptive\" rules of grammar which are presented in school handbooks designed to teach the \"cor\u00ad rect usage\" of upper-class standard English.) A widely used distinc\u00ad tion, developed by Roman Jakobson, is that between the rules governing paradigmatic relations (the \"vertical\" relations between any single word in a sentence and other words that are phonologi- cally, syntactically, or semantically similar, and which can be substi\u00ad tuted for it), and syntagmatic relations (the \"horizontal\" relations which determine the possibilities of putting words in a sequence so as to make a well-formed syntactic unit). On the phonemic and mor\u00ad phemic levels, a similar distinction is made between paradigmatic relations among single elements and syntagmatic relations of se\u00ad quences of elements. This paradigmatic-syntagmatic distinction parallels the distinction made by Jakobson between metaphoric (ver\u00ad tical) and m\u00e9tonymie (horizontal) relations in analyzing figurative language. Noam Chomsky in Syntactic Structures (1957) initiated what is known as transformational-generative grammar. Chomsky's per\u00ad sistent emphasis is on the central feature he calls \"creativity\" in lan\u00ad guage\u2014the fact that a competent native speaker can produce a meaningful sentence which has no exact precedent in the speaker's earlier linguistic experience, as well as the fact that competent audi\u00ad tors can understand the sentence immediately, though it is equally LOCAL COLOR 45 new to them. To explain this \"rule-bound creativity\" of a language, Chomsky proposed that native speakers' and listeners' competence consists in their mastery of a set of generative and transformational rules. This mode of linguistics is called generative in that it under\u00ad takes to establish a finite system of rules that will suffice to \"gener\u00ad ate\"\u2014in the sense that it will adequately account for\u2014the totality of syntactically \"well-formed\" sentences that are possible in a given lan\u00ad guage. It is transformational in that it postulates, in the deep struc\u00ad ture of a language system, a set of \"kernel sentences\" (such as \"John is building a house\") which, in accordance with diverse rules of trans\u00ad formation, serve to produce a great variety of sentences on the sur\u00ad face structure of a language system (e.g., the passive form \"The house is being built by John\" and the question form \"Is John building a house?\" as well as a large number of more complex derivatives from the simple kernel sentence).

Deborah Cameron deals with issues of gender in Feminism and Linguistic Theory (1985). Local Color. The detailed representation in prose fiction of the setting, di\u00ad alect, customs, dress, and ways of thinking and feeling which are distinctive of a particular region, such as Thomas Hardy's \"Wessex\" or Rudyard Kipling's India. After the Civil War a number of American writers exploited the literary possibilities of local color in various parts of America; for example, the West 46 LYRIC (Bret Harte), the Mississippi region (Mark Twain), the South (George Wash\u00ad ington Cable), the Midwest (E. W. Howe, Hamlin Garland), and New England (Sarah Orne Jewett and Mary Wilkins Freeman). The term \"local color writ\u00ad ing\" is often applied to works which, like O. Henry's or Damon Runyon's sto\u00ad ries set in New York City, rely for their interest mainly on a sentimental or comic representation of the surface particularities of a region, instead of on more deep-seated, complex, and general human characteristics and problems. See realism and regional novel. Lyric. In the most common use of the term, a lyric is any fairly short poem, consisting of the utterance by a single speaker, who expresses a state of mind or a process of perception, thought, and feeling. Many lyric speakers are rep\u00ad resented as musing in solitude. In dramatic lyrics, however, the lyric speaker is represented as addressing another person in a specific situation; instances are John Donne's \"Canonization\" and William Wordsworth's \"Tintern Abbey.\" Although the lyric is uttered in the first person, the \"I\" in the poem need not be the poet who wrote it. In some lyrics, such as John Milton's sonnet \"When I consider how my light is spent\" and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"Frost at Midnight,\" the references to the known circumstances of the author's life make it clear that we are to read the poem as a personal expression. Even in such personal lyrics, however, both the character and utterance of the speaker may be formalized and shaped by the author in a way that is con\u00ad ducive to the desired artistic effect. In a number of lyrics, the speaker is a con\u00ad ventional period-figure, such as the long-suffering suitor in the Petrarchan sonnet (see Petrarchan conceit), or the courtly, witty lover of the Cavalier poems. And in some types of lyrics, the speaker is obviously an invented fig\u00ad ure remote from the poet in character and circumstance. (See persona, confes\u00ad sional poetry, and dramatic monologue for distinctions between personal and invented lyric speakers.) The lyric genre comprehends a great variety of utterances. Some, like Ben Jonson's \"To the Memory of. .. William Shakespeare\" and Walt Whitman's ode on the death of Abraham Lincoln, \"O Captain, My Captain,\" are ceremo\u00ad nial poems uttered in a public voice on a public occasion. Among the lyrics in a more private mode, some are simply a brief, intense expression of a mood or state of feeling; for example, Shelley's \"To Night,\" or Emily Dickinson's Wild fine medieval song: Fowles in the frith, The fisshes in the flood, And I mon waxe wood: Much sorwe I walke with For best of bone and blood. But the genre also includes extended expressions of a complex evolution of feelingful thought, as in the long elegy and the meditative ode. And within a lyric, the process of observation, thought, memory, and feeling may be or\u00ad ganized in a variety of ways. For example, in \"love lyrics\" the speaker may MALAPROPISM \u00b7 MARXIST CRITICISM 147 simply express an enamored state of mind in an ordered form, as in Robert Burns' \"O my love's like a red, red rose,\" or Elizabeth Barrett Browning's \"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways\"; or may gallantly elaborate a compli\u00ad ment (Ben Jonson's \"Drink to me only with thine eyes\"); or may deploy an ar\u00ad gument to take advantage of fleeting youth and opportunity (Andrew Marvell's \"To His Coy Mistress,\" or Shakespeare's first seventeen sonnets ad\u00ad dressed to a male youth); or may express a cool response to an importunate lover (Christina Rossetti's \"No, thank you, John\"). In other kinds of lyrics the speaker manifests and justifies a particular disposition and set of values (John Milton's \"L'Allegro\" and \"II Penseroso\"); or expresses a sustained process of observation and meditation in the attempt to resolve an emotional problem (Wordsworth's \"Ode: Intimations of Immortality,\" Arnold's \"Dover Beach\"); or is exhibited as making and justifying the choice of a way of life (Yeats' \"Sailing to Byzantium\"). In the original Greek, \"lyric\" signified a song rendered to the accompani\u00ad ment of a lyre. In some current usages, lyric still retains the sense of a poem written to be set to music; the hymn, for example, is a lyric on a religious sub\u00ad ject that is intended to be sung. The adjectival form \"lyrical\" is sometimes applied to an expressive, song-like passage in a narrative poem, such as Eve's declaration of love to Adam, \"With thee conversing I forget all time,\" in Milton's Paradise Lost, IV, 639-56. See genre for the broad distinction between the three major poetic classes of drama, narrative (or epic), and lyric, and also for the sudden elevation of lyric, in the Romantic period, to the status of the quintessentially poetic mode. For subclasses of the lyric, see aubade, dramatic monologue, elegy, epithal- amion, hymn, ode, sonnet. Refer to Norman Maclean, \"From Action to Image: Theories of the Lyric in the 18th Century,\" in Critics and Criticism, ed. R. S. Crane (1952); Maurice Bowra, Mediaeval Love-Song (1961); William E. Rogers, The Three Genres and the Interpretation of Lyric (1983); Chaviva Hosek and Patricia Parker, eds., Lyric Poetry: Beyond New Criticism (1985); David Lindley, Lyric (1985); Helen Vendler, The Music of What Happens (1988). Malapropism is that type of solecism (the conspicuous and unintended vi\u00ad olation of standard diction or grammar) which mistakenly uses a word in place of another that it resembles; the effect is usually comic. The term derives from Mrs. Malaprop in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's comedy The Rivals (1775), who in the attempt to display a copious vocabulary said things such as \"a progeny of learning,\" \"as headstrong as an allegory on the banks of the Nile,\" and \"he is the very pineapple of politeness.\" Marxist Criticism, in its diverse forms, grounds its theory and practice on the economic and cultural theory of Karl Marx (1818-83) and his fellow- thinker Friedrich Engels, and especially on the following claims: (1) In the last analysis, the evolving history of humanity, of its social groupings and relations, of its institutions, and of its ways of thinking 1 48 MARXIST CRITICISM are largely determined by the changing mode of its \"material produc\u00ad tion\"\u2014that is, of its overall economic organization for producing and distributing material goods. (2) Historical changes in the fundamental mode of material production effect changes in the class structure of a society, establishing in each era dominant and subordinate classes that engage in a struggle for economic, political, and social advantage. (3) Human consciousness is constituted by an ideology\u2014that is, the be\u00ad liefs, values, and ways of thinking and feeling through which human beings perceive, and by recourse to which they explain, what they take to be reality. An ideology is, in complex ways, the product of the position and interests of a particular class. In any historical era, the dominant ideology embodies, and serves to legitimize and perpetu\u00ad ate, the interests of the dominant economic and social class. Ideology was not much discussed by Marx and Engels after The German Ideology, which they wrote jointly in 1845-46, but it has become a key con\u00ad cept in Marxist criticism of literature and the other arts. Marx inherited the term from French philosophers of the late eighteenth century, who used it to designate the study of the way that all general concepts develop from sense- perceptions. In the present era, \"ideology\" is used in a variety of non-Marxist ways, ranging from a derogatory name for any set of political ideas that are held dogmatically and applied rigorously, to a neutral name for ways of per\u00ad ceiving and thinking that are specific to an individual's race, or sex, or edu\u00ad cation, or ethnic group. In its distinctively Marxist use, the reigning ideology in any era is conceived to be, ultimately, the product of its economic struc\u00ad ture and the resulting class-relations and class-interests. In a famed architec\u00ad tural metaphor, Marx represented ideology as a \"superstructure\" of which the concurrent socioeconomic system is the \"base.\" Friedrich Engels de\u00ad scribed ideology as \"a false consciousness,\" and many later Marxists consider it to be constituted largely by unconscious prepossessions that are illusory, in contrast to the \"scientific\" (that is, Marxist) knowledge of the economic de\u00ad terminants, historical evolution, and present constitution of the social world. A further claim is that, in the present era of capitalist economic or\u00ad ganization that emerged during the eighteenth century, the reigning ideol\u00ad ogy incorporates the interests of the dominant and exploitative class, the \"bourgeoisie,\" who are the owners of the means of production and distribu\u00ad tion, as opposed to the \"proletariat,\" or wage-earning working class. This ide\u00ad ology, to those who live in and with it, it is claimed, seems a natural and inevitable way of seeing, explaining, and dealing with the environing world, but in fact has the hidden function of legitimizing and maintaining the po\u00ad sition, power, and economic interests of the ruling class. Bourgeois ideology is regarded as both producing and permeating the social and cultural institu\u00ad tions and practices of the present era\u2014including religion, morality, philoso\u00ad phy, politics, and the legal system, as well as (though in a less direct way) literature and the other arts. MARXIST CRITICISM 1 49 In accordance with some version of the views just outlined, a Marxist critic typically undertakes to explain the literature in any historical era, not as works created in accordance with timeless artistic criteria, but as \"products\" of the economic and ideological determinants specific to that era. What some Marxist critics themselves decry as \"vulgar Marxism\" analyzes a \"bourgeois\" literary work as in direct correlation with the present stage of the class strug\u00ad gle and demands that such works be replaced by a \"social realism\" that will represent the true reality and progressive forces of our time; in practice, this has usually turned out to be the demand that literature conform to an official party line. More flexible Marxists, on the other hand, building upon scattered comments on literature in Marx and Engels themselves, grant that traditional literary works possess a degree of autonomy that enables some of them to transcend the prevailing bourgeois ideology sufficiently to represent (or in the frequent Marxist equivalent, to reflect) aspects of the \"objective\" reality of their time (see imitation). The Hungarian thinker Georg Luk\u00e1cs, the most widely influential of Marxist critics, represents a flexible view of the role of ideology. He proposed that each great work of literature creates \"its own world,\" which is unique and seemingly distinct from \"everyday reality.\" But masters of realism in the novel such as Balzac or Tolstoy, by \"bringing to life the greatest possible rich\u00ad ness of the objective conditions of life,\" and by creating \"typical\" characters who manifest to an extreme the essential tendencies and determinants of their epoch, succeed\u2014often \"in opposition to [the author's] own conscious ideology\"\u2014in producing a fictional world which is a \"reflection of life in the greatest concreteness and clarity and with all its motivating contradictions.\" That is, the fictional world of such writers accords with the Marxist concep\u00ad tion of the real world as constituted by class conflict, economic and social \"contradictions,\" and the alienation of the individual under capitalism. (See bourgeois epic, under epic, and refer to Georg Luk\u00e1cs, Writer and Critic and Other Essays, trans. 1970; the volume also includes Luk\u00e1cs' useful review of the foundational tenets of Marxist criticism, in \"Marx and Engels on Aesthetics.\") While lauding nineteenth-century literary realism, Luk\u00e1cs attacked mod\u00ad ernist experimental writers as \"decadent\" instances of concern with the sub\u00ad jectivity of the alienated individual in the fragmented world of our late stage of capitalism. (See modernism.) He thereby inaugurated a vigorous debate among Marxist critics about the political standing of formal innovators in twentieth-century literature. In opposition to Luk\u00e1cs, the Frankfurt School of German Marxists, especially Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, lauded modernist writers such as James Joyce, Marcel Proust, and Samuel Beckett, proposing that their formal experiments, by the very fact that they fragment and disrupt the life they \"reflect,\" effect a distance and detachment that serve as an implicit critique\u2014or yield a \"negative knowledge\"\u2014of the dehumaniz\u00ad ing institutions and processes of society under capitalism. Two rather maverick German Marxists, Bertolt Brecht and Walter Benjamin, who also supported modernist and nonrealistic art, have had con\u00ad siderable influence on non-Marxist as well as Marxist criticism. In his critical 1 50 MARXIST CRITICISM theory, and in his own dramatic writings (see epic theater), Bertolt Brecht re\u00ad jected what he called the \"Aristotelian\" concept that a tragic play is an imita\u00ad tion of reality with a unified plot and a universal theme which establishes an identification of the audience with the hero and produces a catharsis of the spectator's emotions. (See Aristotle, under tragedy and plot) Brecht proposes instead that the illusion of reality should be deliberately shattered by an episodic plot, by protagonists who do not attract the audience's sympathy, by a striking theatricality in staging and acting, and by other ways of baring the artifice of drama so as to produce an \"alienation effect\" (see under distance and involvement). The result of such alienation will be to jar audiences out of their passive acceptance of modern capitalist society as a natural way of life, into an attitude not only (as in Adorno) of critical understanding of capitalist shortcomings, but of active engagement with the forces of change. Another notable critic, Walter Benjamin, was both an admirer of Brecht and briefly an associate of the Frankfurt School. Particularly influential was Benjamin's at\u00ad tention to the effects of changing material conditions in the production of the arts, especially the recent technological developments of the mass media that have promoted, he said, \"a revolutionary criticism of traditional con\u00ad cepts of art.\" In his essay \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Repro\u00ad duction,\" Benjamin proposes that modern technical innovations such as photography, the phonograph, the radio, and especially the cinema, have transformed the very concept and status of a work of art. Formerly an artist or author produced a work which was a single object, regarded as the special pre\u00ad serve of the bourgeois elite, around which developed a quasi-religious \"aura\" of uniqueness, autonomy, and aesthetic value independent of any social func\u00ad tion\u2014an aura which invited in the spectator a passive attitude of absorbed contemplation in the object itself. The new media not only make possible the infinite and precise reproducibility of the objects of art, but effect the produc\u00ad tion of works which, like motion pictures, are specifically designed to be reproduced in multiple copies. Such modes of art, Benjamin argues, by de\u00ad stroying the mystique of the unique work of art as a subject for pure contem\u00ad plation, make possible a radical role for works of art by opening the way to \"the formulation of revolutionary demands in the politics of art.\" (A useful collection of central essays by the Marxist critics Luk\u00e1cs, Brecht, Benjamin, and Adorno is R. Taylor, ed., Aesthetics and Politics, 1977.) Since the middle of the present century there has been a resurgence of Marxist criticism, marked by an openness, on some level of literary analysis, to other current critical perspectives; a flexibility which acknowledges that Marxist critical theory is itself not a set of timeless truths but at least to some degree an evolving historical process; a subtilizing of the concept of ideology as applied to literary content; and a tendency to grant an increased role to non-ideological and distinctively artistic determinants of literary structures. In the 1960s the influential French Marxist Louis Althusser assimilated the structuralism then current into his view that the structure of society is not a monolithic whole, but is constituted by a diversity of \"nonsynchronous\" so\u00ad cial formations, or \"ideological state apparatuses,\" including religious, legal, MARXIST CRITICISM 151 political, and literary institutions. Each of these is interrelated with the others in complex ways, but possesses a \"relative autonomy\"; only \"in the last in\u00ad stance\" is the ideology of a particular institution determined by its material base in contemporary economic production. In an influential reconsideration of the nature of ideology, Althusser opposes its definition as simply \"false consciousness\"; he declares instead that ideologies vary according to the form and practices of each mode of state apparatus, and that the ideology of each mode operates by means of a type of discourse which interpellates (calls upon) the individual to take up a pre-established \"subject position\"\u2014that is, a position as a person with certain views and values which, in every instance, serve the ultimate interests of the ruling class. (See discourse under post- structuralism.) Within the particular social formation of literature, further\u00ad more, a great work is not a mere product of ideology, because its fiction estab\u00ad lishes for the reader a distance from which to recognize, hence expose, \"the ideology from which it is born ... from which it detaches itself as art, and to which it alludes.\" Pierre Macherey, in A Theory of Literary Production (1966, trans. 1978), stressed the supplementary claim that a literary text not only distances itself from its ideology by its fiction and form, but also exposes the \"contradictions\" that are inherent in that ideology by its \"silences\" or \"gaps\"\u2014that is, by what the text fails to say because its ideology makes it im\u00ad possible to say it. Such textual \"absences\" are symptoms of ideological repres\u00ad sions of the contents in the text's own \"unconscious.\" The aim of Marxist criticism, Macherey asserts, is to make these silences \"speak\" and so to reveal, behind what an author consciously intended to say, the text's unconscious content\u2014that is, its repressed awareness of the flaws, stresses, and incoher\u00ad ence in the very ideology that it incorporates. Between 1929 and 1935 the Italian Communist Antonio Gramsci, while imprisoned by the fascist government, wrote approximately thirty documents on political, social, and cultural subjects, known as the \"prison notebooks.\" Gramsci maintains the original Marxist distinction between the economic base and the cultural superstructure, but replaces the older notion that culture is a disguised \"reflection\" of the material base with the concept that the rela\u00ad tion between the two is one of \"reciprocity,\" or interactive influence. Gramsci places special emphasis on the popular, as opposed to the elite elements of culture, ranging from folklore and popular music to the cinema. Gramsci's most widely echoed concept is that of hegemony: that a social class achieves a predominant influence and power, not by direct and overt means, but by succeeding in making its ideological view of society so pervasive that the sub\u00ad ordinate classes unwittingly accept and participate in their own oppression. Gramsci's prison writings have become widely influential since they were published late in the 1940s, especially among literary and social critics, such as Terry Eagleton in England and Fredric Jameson and Edward Said in Amer\u00ad ica, who concern themselves with the power of literary culture to intervene in and to transform existing economic and political arrangements and activities. See Gramsci, Selections from Cultural Writings, trans. William Boelhower, 1985; Chantal Mouffe, ed., Gramsci and Marxist Theory, 1979. MARXIST CRITICISM In England the many social and critical writings of Raymond Williams manifest an adaptation of Marxist concepts to his humanistic concern with the overall texture of an individual's \"lived experience.\" A leading theorist of Marxist criticism in England is Terry Eagleton, who has expanded and elabo\u00ad rated the concepts of Althusser and Macherey into his view that a literary text is a special kind of production in which ideological discourse\u2014described as any system of mental representations of lived experience\u2014is reworked into a specifically literary discourse. In recent years Eagleton has been increasingly hospitable to the tactical use, for dealing with ideology in literature, of con\u00ad cepts derived from deconstruction and from Lacan's version of Freudian psycho\u00ad analysis. Eagleton views such poststructuralist analyses as useful to Marxist critics of literary texts insofar as they serve to undermine reigning beliefs and certainties, but only as preliminary to the properly Marxist enterprise of ex\u00ad posing their ideological motivation and to the application of the criticism of literature toward politically desirable ends. The most prominent American theorist, Fredric Jameson, is also the most eclectic of current Marxist critics. In The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a So\u00ad cially Symbolic Act (1981), Jameson expressly adapts to his synthetic critical enterprise such seemingly incompatible viewpoints as the medieval theory of fourfold levels of meaning in the allegorical interpretation of the Bible, the archetypal criticism of Northrop Frye, structuralist criticism, Lacan's reinter- pretations Freud, semiotics, and deconstruction. These modes of criticism, Jameson asserts, are applicable at various stages of the critical interpretation of a literary work; but Marxist criticism, he contends, \"subsumes\" all the other \"interpretive modes,\" by retaining their positive findings within a \"po\u00ad litical interpretation of literary texts\" which stands as the \"final\" or \"absolute horizon of all reading and all interpretation.\" This last-analysis \"political in\u00ad terpretation\" of a literary text involves an exposure of the hidden role of the \"political unconscious\"\u2014a concept which Jameson describes as his \"collec\u00ad tive,\" or \"political,\" adaptation of the Freudian concept that each individual's unconscious is a repository of repressed desires. (See psychological and psycho\u00ad analytic criticism.) In any literary product of our late capitalist era, the \"rifts and discontinuities\" in the text, and especially those elements which, in the French phrase, are its \"non-dit\" (its not-said), are symptoms of the repression by a predominant ideology of the contradictions of \"History\" into the depths of the political unconscious; and the content of this repressed History, Jameson asserts, is the revolutionary process of \"the collective struggle to wrest a realm of Freedom from a realm of Necessity.\" In the final stage of an interpretation, Jameson holds, the Marxist critic \"rewrites,\" in the mode of \"allegory,\" the literary text \"in such a way that the [text] may be seen as the .. . reconstruction of a prior historical or ideological subtext\"\u2014that is, of the text's unspoken, because repressed and unconscious, awareness of the ways it is determined not only by current ideology, but also by the long-term process of true \"History.\" See sociology of literature, and for the Marxist wing of the new historicism, see cultural materialism under the entry new historicism.

The masque (a variant spelling of \"mask\") was inaugurated in Re\u00ad naissance Italy and flourished in England during the reigns of Elizabeth I, James I, and Charles I. In its full development, it was an elaborate form of court entertainment that combined poetic drama, music, song, dance, splen\u00ad did costuming, and stage spectacle. A plot\u2014often slight, and mainly mytho\u00ad logical and allegorical\u2014served to hold together these diverse elements. The speaking characters, who wore masks (hence the title), were often played by amateurs who belonged to courtly society. The play concluded with a dance in which the players doffed their masks and were joined by the audience. In the early seventeenth century in England the masque drew upon the finest artistic talents of the day, including Ben Jonson for the poetic script (for example, The Masque ofBlacknesse and The Masque of Queens) and Inigo Jones, the architect, for the elaborate sets, costumes, and stage machinery. Each lav\u00ad ish production cost a fortune; it was literally the sport of kings and queens, until both court and drama were abruptly ended by the Puritan triumph of 1642. The two examples best known to modern readers are the masque- within-a-play in the fourth act of Shakespeare's The Tempest, and Milton's sage and serious revival of the form, Comus, with songs by the composer Henry Lawes, which was presented at Ludlow Castle in 1634. The antimasque was a form developed by Ben Jonson. In it the charac\u00ad ters were grotesque and unruly, the action ludicrous, and the humor broad; it 54 MELODRAMA \u00b7 METAPHOR, THEORIES OF served as a foil and countertype to the elegance, order, and ceremony of the masque proper, which preceded it in a performance. See Enid Welsford, The Court Masque (1927); Allardyce Nicoli, Stuart Masques and the Renaissance Stage (1937). Stephen Orgel and Roy Strong, in Inigo Jones: The Theatre of the Stuart Court (2 vols., 1973), discuss Jones' contri\u00ad butions to the masque, with copious illustrations. Melodrama. \"Melos\" is Greek for song, and the term \"melodrama\" was originally applied to all musical plays, including opera. In early nineteenth- century London, many plays were produced with a musical accompaniment that (as in modern motion pictures) served simply to fortify the emotional tone of the various scenes; the procedure was developed in part to circumvent the Licensing Act, which allowed \"legitimate\" plays only as a monopoly of the Drury Lane and Covent Garden theaters, but permitted musical entertain\u00ad ments elsewhere. The term \"melodrama\" is now often applied to some of the typical plays, especially during the Victorian Period, that were written to be produced to musical accompaniment. The Victorian melodrama can be said to bear the relation to tragedy that farce does to comedy. Typically, the protagonists are flat types: the hero is great-hearted, the heroine pure as the driven snow, and the villain a monster of malignity (the sharply contrasted good guys and bad guys of the movie western and some television dramas are modern derivatives from standard types of characters in the old melodramas). The plot revolves around malevo\u00ad lent intrigue and violent action, while the credibility both of character and plot is sacrificed for violent effect and emotional opportunism. Nineteenth- century melodramas such as Under the Gaslight (1867) and the temperance play Ten Nights in a Barroom (1858) are still sometimes produced\u2014less for thrills, however, than for laughs. Recently, the composer Stephen Sondheim converted George Dibdin Pitt's Victorian thriller Sweeney Todd, The Barber of Fleet Street (1842) into a highly effective musical drama. The terms \"melodrama\" and \"melodramatic\" are also, in an extended sense, applied to any literary work or episode, whether in drama or prose fic\u00ad tion, that relies on implausible events and sensational action. Melodrama, in this sense, was standard fare in cowboy-and-Indian and cops-and-robber types of silent films, and remains alive and flourishing in current cinematic and television productions. See M. W. Disher, Blood and Thunder: Mid-Victorian Melodrama and Its Ori\u00ad gins (1949) and Plots That Thrilled (1954); Frank Rahill, The World of Melo\u00ad drama (1967); R. Heilman, Tragedy and Melodrama (1968); David Thorburn, \"Television Melodrama,\" Television as a Cultural Force, ed.

When someone says, in discussing John's eating habits, \"John is a pig,\" and when Coleridge writes in \"The Ancient Mariner\" METAPHOR, THEORIES OF 1 55 The moonlight steeped in silentness The steady weathercock, we recognize that \"pig\" and \"steeped\" are metaphors, and have no trouble understanding them. But after twenty-five centuries of attention to meta\u00ad phors by rhetoricians, grammarians, and literary critics\u2014in which during the last half-century they have been joined by many philosophers\u2014there is no general agreement about the way we identify metaphors, how we are able to understand them, and what (if anything) they serve to tell us. (See metaphor under figurative language.) Following is a brief summary of the most promi\u00ad nent views about metaphor: (1) The similarity view. This was the traditional way of analyzing meta\u00ad phors, from the time that Aristotle introduced it in the fourth century until the recent past. It holds that a metaphor is a departure from the literal (that is, the standard) use of language which serves as a con\u00ad densed or elliptical simile, in that it involves an implicit comparison between two disparate things. (The two things in the examples cited above are John's eating habits and those of a pig, and the event of something being steeped\u2014soaked in a liquid\u2014and the appearance of the moonlit landscape.) This view usually assumes that the features being compared pre-existed the use of the metaphor; that the met\u00ad aphor can be translated into a statement of literal similarity without loss of cognitive content (that is, of the information it conveys); and also that a metaphor serves mainly to enhance the rhetorical force and stylistic vividness and pleasantness of a discourse. (2) The interaction view. In The Philosophy of Rhetoric (1936) I. A. Richards introduced the terms vehicle for the metaphorical word (in the two examples, \"pig\" and \"steeped\") and tenor for the subject to which the metaphorical word is applied (John's eating habits and the moonlit landscape). In place of the similarity view, he proposed that a metaphor works by bringing together the disparate \"thoughts\" of the vehicle and tenor so as to effect a meaning that \"is a resultant of their interaction\" and that cannot be duplicated by literal assertions of a similarity between the two elements. He also asserted that metaphor cannot be viewed simply as a rhetorical or poetic departure from ordinary usage, in that it permeates all language and affects the ways we perceive and conceive the world. Almost twenty years later, in an influential essay entitled \"Meta\u00ad phor\" (1954-55), the philosopher Max Black refined and greatly ex\u00ad panded Richards' treatment. Black proposed that each of the two elements in a metaphor has a \"system of associated commonplaces,\" consisting of the properties and relations that we commonly attach to the object, person, or event. When we understand a metaphor, the system of commonplaces associated with the \"subsidiary subject\" (equivalent to I. A. Richards' \"vehicle\") interacts with the system 1 56 METAPHOR, THEORIES OF associated with the \"principal subject\" (Richards' \"tenor\") so as to \"fil\u00ad ter\" or \"screen\" that system, and thus effects a new way of perceiving and conceiving the principal subject. This process, by which a com\u00ad plex set of associations serves to select and reorganize a second set, Black claims, is a \"distinctive intellectual operation.\" He also claims that, in place of saying that metaphors simply formulate a pre-existing similarity between the two subjects, \"it would be more illuminating in some of these cases to say that the metaphor creates the similarity.\" Before Max Black's essay, philosophers had paid only passing at\u00ad tention to metaphor. The reigning assumption had been that the main function of language is to communicate truths, and that truths can be clearly communicated only in literal language. For the most part, accordingly, philosophers adverted to metaphor only to warn against its intrusion into rational discourse, as opposed to poetry and oratory, on the ground that figurative language, as John Locke had said in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690), serves only \"to insinuate wrong ideas, move the passions, and thereby mislead the judgment.\" Black's essay, however, inaugurated a philosophical concern with metaphor which, since the 1960s, has resulted in a flood of publications. Many of these writings restate, with various qualifications, refinements, and expansions, either the similarity or interaction views of metaphor. Within these contributions, however, one can identify two additional views, both of which have been in\u00ad fluential in literary theory as well as in philosophy: (3) The pragmatic view. In an essay \"What Metaphors Mean\" (1978), Donald Davidson mounted a challenge to the standard assumption that there is a metaphorical meaning as distinct from a literal mean\u00ad ing. \"Metaphors,\" he claims, \"mean what the words, in their most lit\u00ad eral interpretation, mean, and nothing more.\" The question of metaphor is pragmatic, not semantic; that is, it is the use of a literal statement in such a way as to \"suggest,\" or \"intimate,\" or \"lead us to notice\" what we might otherwise overlook. In a chapter on \"Meta\u00ad phor\" in Expression and Meaning (1979), John Searle also rejected the similarity and interaction views, on the grounds that at best they serve to explain, and that only in part and in a misleading way, how some metaphors come to be used and understood. In consonance with his overall speech act theory, Searle proposed that to explain metaphor we must distinguish between \"word, or sentence meaning\" (what the word or sentence means literally) and a speaker's \"utter\u00ad ance meaning\" (the metaphorical meaning that a speaker uses the lit\u00ad eral word or sentence meaning to express). Searle goes on to propose a set of implicit principles, shared by the speaker and interpreter, to explain how a speaker can use a sentence with a literal meaning to say something with a very different metaphorical meaning, as well as to clarify how a hearer recognizes and proceeds to interpret a literal sentence that is used metaphorically. METAPHOR, THEORIES OF 157 (4) The cognitive (or conceptual) view. This view of metaphor, promi\u00ad nent since about 1980, begins by rejecting the assumption in many earlier theories of metaphor that the ordinary, normal use of language is literal, from which metaphor is a deviation for special rhetorical and poetic purposes. Instead it claims that the ordinary use of lan\u00ad guage is pervasively and indispensably metaphorical, and that met\u00ad aphor persistently and profoundly structures the ways human beings perceive, what they know, and how they think. George Lakoff and Mark Turner in More than Cool Reason (1979) provide a short and accessible introduction to this cognitive view, with special attention to its relevance for the analysis of metaphors in poetry. They conceive metaphor to be a projection and mapping across what they call \"conceptual domains\"; that is, its use is basically a cognitive mental process, of which the metaphorical word, phrase, or sentence is only the linguistic aspect and expression. To identify the two elements that compose a metaphor, the authors replace \"ve\u00ad hicle\" and \"tenor,\" or \"primary\" \"source domain\" and \"target domain.\" In using and understanding a metaphor, part of the conceptual structure of the source domain is \"mapped\" onto the conceptual structure of the target domain, in a one-way \"transaction\" (as distinct from an \"interaction\") which may serve to alter and re-organize the way we perceive or think about the latter element. A distinctive procedure in this view is to identify a number of \"basic conceptual metaphors\" that pervade discourse in our Western culture, but are so common and operate so automatically that for the most part we use them without noticing them. Some of the most common basic metaphors are: Purposes Are Destinations; Time Moves; Time Is A Reaper; Life Is A Journey; Life Is A Play; People Are Plants. Such metaphors establish cross-conceptual mappings that manifest themselves in our ordinary speech as well as in the greatest poetry. People Are Plants, for example, is a type of cognitive mapping that underlies such everyday expressions as \"She's in the flower of youth,\" \"She's a late bloomer,\" and \"He's withering fast,\" no less than it does King Lear's \"Ripeness is all.\" The difference between trivially conventional and innovatively poetic uses of a basic metaphor, by this analysis, is a difference not in cognitive kind, but in the range and diversity of application, and in the skill manifested in its verbal expression. And in all uses (including in the language of the sciences) cross-domain metaphors play an ineradicable part in determining what we know, how we reason, what values we assign, and the ways we conduct our lives. Vigorous debates about metaphor continue apace. An emerging conclusion is that the diverse accounts of metaphor need not be mu\u00ad tually exclusive, in that each is directed especially to a particular one of many kinds of metaphor or functions of metaphor, or focuses on a 1 58 METAPHYSICAL POETS different moment in the process of recognizing and understanding a metaphor, or is adapted to the perspective of a distinctive worldview. Mark Johnson, ed., Philosophical Perspectives on Metaphor (1981) includes, among others, the writings on metaphor (mentioned above) by Richards, Black, Davidson, and Searle; Sheldon Sacks, ed., On Metaphor (1987) contains essays by both philosophers and literary critics; and Andrew Ortony, ed., Metaphor and Thought (second ed., 1993) includes an essay by George Lakoff that summarizes the cogni\u00ad tive treatments of metaphor. On the cognitive view, see also George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, Metaphors We Live By (1980), and Mark Turner, Death Is the Mother of Beauty (1987). For earlier analyses of the cognitive function of metaphors, see Stephen C. Pepper, World Hy\u00ad potheses (1942), on the \"root metaphors\" that generate the major philosophical worldviews; and M. H. Abrams, The Minor and the Lamp (1953), on the \"constitutive metaphors\" that provide the structure and categories of diverse theories of literature and the other arts. See also Paul Ricoeur, The Rule of Metaphor (1977), and for an influential essay on metaphor by a deconstructive theorist, Jacques Derrida, \"White Mythology,\" in Margins of Discourse (1982). Metaphysical Poets. John Dryden said in his Discourse Concerning Satire (1693) that John Donne in his poetry \"affects the metaphysics,\" meaning that Donne employs the terminology and abstruse arguments of the medieval Scholastic philosophers. In 1779 Samuel Johnson extended the term \"meta\u00ad physical\" from Donne to a school of poets, in the acute and balanced critique which he incorporated in his \"Life of Cowley.\" The name is now applied to a group of seventeenth-century poets who, whether or not directly influenced by Donne, employ similar poetic procedures and imagery, both in secular po\u00ad etry (Cleveland, Marvell, Cowley) and in religious poetry (Herbert, Vaughan, Crashaw, and Traherne). Attempts have been made to demonstrate that these poets had in com\u00ad mon a philosophical worldview. The term \"metaphysical,\" however, fits these very diverse writers only if it is used, as Johnson used it, to indicate a common poetic style, use of figurative language, and way of organizing the meditative process or the poetic argument. Donne set the metaphysical mode by writing poems which are sharply opposed to the rich mellifluousness and the idealized view of human nature and of sexual love which had constituted a central tra\u00ad dition in Elizabethan poetry, especially in Spenser and the writers of Petrarchan sonnets; Donne's poems are opposed also to the fluid, regular verification of Donne's contemporaries, the Cavalier poets. Instead, Donne wrote in a diction and meter modeled on the rough give-and-take of actual speech, and often or\u00ad ganized his poems in the form of an urgent or heated argument\u2014with a reluc\u00ad tant mistress, or an intruding friend, or God, or death, or with himself. He employed a subtle and often deliberately outrageous logic; he was realistic, ironic, and sometimes cynical in his treatment of the complexity of human motives, especially in the sexual relation; and whether playful or serious, and METER 159 whether writing the poetry of love or of intense religious experience, he was above all \"witty,\" making ingenious use o\u00ed paradox, pun, and startling parallels in simile and metaphor (see metaphysical conceit and wit). The beginnings of four of Donne's poems will illustrate the shock tactic, the dramatic form of di\u00ad rect address, the rough idiom, and the rhythms of the living voice that are characteristic of his metaphysical style: Go and catch a falling star, Get with child a mandrake root. .. For God's sake hold your tongue, and let me love. Busy old fool, unruly sun ... Batter my heart, three-personed God ... Some, not all, of Donne's poetic procedures have parallels in each of his con\u00ad temporaries and successors whom literary historians usually group as meta\u00ad physical poets. These poets have had admirers in every age, but beginning with the Neo- classic Period of the later seventeenth century, they were by most critics and readers regarded as interesting but perversely ingenious and obscure expo\u00ad nents of false wit, until a drastic revaluation after World War I elevated Donne, and to a lesser extent Herbert and Marvell, high in the hierarchy of English poets (see canon of literature). This reversal owed much to H. J. C. Grierson's Introduction to Metaphysical Lyrics and Poems of the Seventeenth Century (1912), was given strong impetus by T. S. Eliot's essays \"The Metaphysical Poets\" and \"Andrew Marvell\" (1921), continued by a great number of commen\u00ad tators, including F. R. Leavis in England and especially the American New Critics, who tended to elevate the metaphysical style into the model of their ideal poetry of irony, paradox, and \"unified sensibility.\" (See dissociation of sensibility.) More recently, Donne has lost his exemplary status, but continues to occupy a firm position as a prominent poet in the English canon. See George Williamson, The Donne Tradition (1930); F. R. Leavis, Revalua\u00ad tion Rosemund Tuve, Elizabethan and Metaphysical Imagery (1947); J. E. Duncan, The Revival of Metaphysical Poetry (1959); Helen Gardner, ed., John Donne: A Collection of Crit\u00ad ical Essays (1962). F. J. Warnke, European Metaphysical Poetry (1961), treats the continental vogue of this style. Meter is the recurrence, in regular units, of a prominent feature in the se\u00ad quence of speech-sounds of a language. There are four main types of meter in European languages: (1) In classical Greek and Latin, the meter was quantita\u00ad tive; that is, it was established by the relative duration of the utterance of a syllable, and consisted of a recurrent pattern of long and short syllables. (2) In French and many other Romance languages, the meter is syllabic, depending on the number of syllables within a line of verse, without regard to the fall of the stresses. (3) In the older Germanic languages, including Old English, the meter is accentual, depending on the number of stressed syllables within a line, without regard to the number of intervening unstressed syllables. (4) The 160 METER fourth type of meter, combining the features of the two preceding types, is accentual-syllabic, in which the metric units consist of a recurrent pattern of stresses on a recurrent number of syllables. The stress-and-syllable type has been the predominant meter of English poetry since the fourteenth century. There is considerable dispute about the most valid way to analyze and classify English meters. This entry will begin by presenting a traditional accentual-syllabic analysis which has the virtues of being simple, widely used, and applicable to by far the greater part of English poetry from Chaucer to the present. Major departures from this stress-and-syllable meter will be described in the latter part of the entry. In all sustained spoken English we sense a rhythm; that is, a recognize- able though varying pattern in the beat of the stresses, or accents (the more forcefully uttered, hence louder syllables), in the stream of speech-sounds. In meter, this rhythm is structured into a recurrence of regular\u2014that is, approxi\u00ad mately equivalent\u2014units of stress-pattern. Compositions written in meter are also known as verse. We attend, in reading verse, to the individual line, which is a sequence of words printed as a separate entity on the page. The meter is determined by the pattern of stronger and weaker stresses on the syllables composing the words in the verse-line; the stronger is called the \"stressed\" syllable and all the weaker ones the \"unstressed\" syllables. (What the ear perceives as a strong stress is not an absolute quantity, but is relative to the degree of stress in the adjacent syllables.) Three major factors determine where the stresses (in the sense of the relatively stronger stresses or accents) will fall in a line of verse: (1) Most important is the \"word accent\" in words of more than one syllable; in the noun \"accent\" itself, for example, the stress falls on the first syllable. (2) There are also many monosyllabic words in the language, and on which of these\u2014in a sentence or a phrase\u2014the stress will fall depends on the grammat\u00ad ical function of the word (we normally put stronger stress on nouns, verbs, and adjectives, for example, than on articles or prepositions), and depends also on the \"rhetorical accent,\" or the emphasis we give a word because we want to enhance its importance in a particular utterance. (3) Another deter\u00ad minant of perceived stress is the prevailing \"metrical accent,\" which is the beat that we have come to expect, in accordance with the stress pattern that was established earlier in the metrical composition. If the prevailing stress pattern enforces a drastic alteration of the normal word accent, we get a wrenched accent. Wrenching may be the result of a lack of metrical skill; it was, however, conventional in the folk ballad (for example, \"fair ladie,\" \"far countr\u00e9e\"), and is sometimes deliberately used for comic ef\u00ad fects, as in Lord Byron's Don Juan (1819-24) and in the verses of Ogden Nash. It is possible to distinguish a number of degrees of syllabic stress in Eng\u00ad lish speech, but the most common and generally useful fashion of analyzing and classifying the standard English meters is \"binary.\" That is, we distinguish only two categories\u2014strong stress and weak stress\u2014and group the syllables into metric feet according to the patterning of these two degrees. A foot is the METER 161 combination of a strong stress and the associated weak stress or stresses which make up the recurrent metric unit of a line. The relatively stronger-stressed syllable is called, for short, \"stressed\"; the relatively weaker-stressed syllables are called \"light,\" or most commonly, \"unstressed.\" The four standard feet distinguished in English are: (1) Iambic (the noun is \"iamb\"): an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable. The c\u00far I few tolls I the kn\u00e9ll I of par I ting day. I (Thomas Gray, \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\") (2) Anapestic (the noun is \"anapest\"): two unstressed syllables followed by a stressed syllable. The \u00c4s syr I i\u00e4n came down I like \u00e4 w\u00f3lf I on the fold. I (Lord Byron, \"The Destruction of Sennacherib\") (3) Trochaic (the noun is \"trochee\"): a stressed followed by an unstressed syllable. There they I are, my I fif ty I men and I w\u00f3 men. I (Robert Browning, \"One Word More\") Most trochaic lines lack the final unstressed syllable\u2014in the technical term, such lines are \"The Tiger\": T\u00ed g\u00e9r! I t\u00ed g\u00ebr! I burn ing I bright I In the I fo rest I of the I night. I (4) Dactylic (the noun is \"dactyl\"): a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables. Eve, with her I bas k\u00ebt, was I Deep in the I bells and grass. I (Ralph Hodgson, \"Eve\") Iambs and anapests, since the strong stress is at the end, are called \"rising meter\"; trochees and dactyls, with the strong stress at the beginning, are called \"falling meter.\" Iambs and trochees, having three syllables, are called \"triple meter.\" It should be noted that the iamb is by far the commonest English foot. Two other feet are often distinguished by special titles, although they occur in English meter only as variants from standard feet: Spondaic (the noun is \"spondee\"): two successive syllables with ap\u00ad proximately equal strong stresses, as in each of the first two feet of this line: Good str\u00f3ngl thick stulp\u00eb 162 METER Pyrrhic (the noun is also \"pyrrhic\"): a foot composed of two succes\u00ad sive syllables with approximately equal light stresses, as in the second and fourth feet in this line: My way I is to I be gin I with the I be gin ningl (Byron, Don Juan) This latter term is used only infrequently. Some traditional metrists deny the existence of a true pyrrhic, on the grounds that the prevailing metrical ac\u00ad cent\u2014in the above instance, iambic\u2014always imposes a slightly stronger stress on one of the two syllables. A metric line is named according to the number of feet composing it: monometer: one foot dimeter: two feet trimeter: three feet tetrameter: four feet pentameter: five feet hexameter: six feet (an Alexandrine is a line of six iambic feet) heptameter: seven feet (a fourteener is another term for a line of seven iambic feet\u2014hence, of fourteen syllables; it tends to break into a unit of four feet followed by a unit of three feet) octameter: eight feet To describe the meter of a line we name (a) the predominant foot and (b) the number of feet it contains. In the illustrations above, for example, the line from Gray's \"Elegy\" is \"iambic pentameter,\" and the Destruction of Sennacherib\" is \"anapestic tetrameter.\" To scan a passage of verse is to go through it line by line, analyzing the component feet, and also indicating where any major pauses in the phrasing fall within a line. Here is a scansion, signified by conventional symbols, of the first five lines from John Keats' Endymion (1818). The passage was chosen because it exemplifies a flexible and variable rather than a highly regular met\u00ad rical pattern. (1) A thing I of beau I ty is I \u00e4 joy I for \u00e9 v\u00ebr: I (2) Its love I l\u00ec n\u00ebss I in cr\u00e9as I es; // it I will n\u00e9v \u00ebr I (3) Pass in I to noth I ing n\u00ebss, I // but still I will keep I (4) A b\u00f3w I \u00ebr qui I et for I us, // and I \u00e4 sleep I (5) Full of I sweet dreams, I and health, I and qui I et breath ing. I The prevailing meter is iambic pentameter. As in all fluent verse, however, there are many variations upon the basic iambic foot; these are sometimes called \"substitutions.\" Thus: (1) The closing feet of lines 1, 2, and 5 end with an extra unstressed syl\u00ad lable, and are said to have a feminine ending. In lines 3 and 4, the closing feet, because they are standard iambs, end with a stressed syl\u00ad lable and are said to have masculine endings. METER 163 (2) In lines 3 and 5, the opening iambic feet have been \"inverted\" to form trochees. (The initial position is the most common place for in\u00ad versions in iambic verse.) (3) I have marked the second foot in line 2, and the third foot of line 3 and line 4, as pyrrhics (two unstressed syllables); these help to give Keats' verses their rapid movement. This is a procedure in scansion about which metric analysts disagree: some will feel enough of a met\u00ad ric beat to mark all these feet as iambs; others will mark still other feet (for example, the third foot of line 1) as pyrrhics also. And some metrists prefer to use symbols measuring two degrees of strong stress, and will indicate a difference in the feet, as follows: Its love I fi n\u00e9ss I in creas I es. Notice, however, that these are differences only in nuance; analysts agree that the prevailing pulse of Keats' versification is iambic throughout, and that de\u00ad spite many variations, the felt norm is of five stresses in the verse-line. Two other elements are important in the metric movement of Keats' pas\u00ad sage: (1) In lines 1 and 5, the pause in the reading\u2014which occurs naturally at the end of a sentence, clause, or other syntactic unit\u2014coincides with the end of the line; such lines are called end-stopped. Lines 2 through 4, on the other hand, are called run-on lines (or in a term derived from the French, they ex\u00ad hibit enjambment\u2014\"a striding-over\"), because the pressure of the incom\u00ad pleted syntactic unit toward closure carries on over the end of the verse-line. (2) When a strong phrasal pause falls within a line, as in lines 2, 3, and 4, it is called a caesura\u2014indicated in the quoted passage by the conventional sym\u00ad bol //. The management of these internal pauses is important for giving vari\u00ad ety and for providing expressive emphases in the long pentameter line. To understand the use and limitations of an analysis such as this, we must realize that a prevailing metric pattern (iambic pentameter, in the passage from Keats) establishes itself as a perceived norm which controls the reader's expec\u00ad tations, even though the number of lines that deviate from the norm may ex\u00ad ceed the number that fit the norm exactly. In addition, scansion is an abstract scheme which deliberately omits notation of many aspects of the actual read\u00ad ing of a poem that contribute importantly to its pace, rhythm, and total im\u00ad pression. It does not specify, for example, whether the component words in a metric line are short words or long words, or whether the strong stresses fall on short vowels or long vowels; it does not give any indication of the intonation\u2014 the overall rise and fall in the pitch and loudness of the voice\u2014which we use to bring out the meaning and rhetorical effect of these poetic lines; nor does it indicate the interplay of the metric stresses with the rhythms of the varied phrasal and clausal structures within a sustained poetic passage. Such details are omitted in order to lay bare the essential metric skeleton; that is, the pat\u00ad tern of the stronger and weaker stresses in the syllabic sequence of a verse-line. Moreover, an actual reading of a poem, if it is a skillful reading, will not accord mechanically with the scansion. There is a difference between the scansion, as 164 METER an abstract metrical norm, and a skilled and expressive oral reading, or per\u00ad formance, of a poem; and no two competent readers will perform the same lines in precisely the same way. But in a performance, the metric norm indi\u00ad cated by the scansion is sensed as an implicit understructure of pulses; in fact, the interplay of an expressive performance, sometimes with and sometimes against this underlying structural pattern, gives tension and vitality to our ex\u00ad perience of verse. We need to note, finally, that some kinds of versification which occur in English poetry differ from the syllable-and-stress type already described: (1) Strong-stress meters or accentual verse. In this meter, native to Eng\u00ad lish and other Germanic languages, only the beat of the strong stresses counts in the scanning, while the number of intervening light syllables is highly variable. Usually there are four strong-stressed syllables in a line, whose beat is emphasized by alliteration. This was the meter of Old English poetry and continued to be the meter of many Middle English poems, until Chaucer and others popularized the syllable-and-stress meter. In the opening passage, for example, of Piers Plowman (later fourteenth century) the four strong stresses (al\u00ad ways divided by a medial caesura) are for the most part reinforced by alliteration (see alliterative meter); the light syllables, which vary in number, are recessive and do not assert their individual presence: In a s\u00f3mer s\u00e9son, // whan soft was the sonne, I sh\u00f3pe me in shr\u00f3udes, // as \u00ed a sh\u00e9pe were, In habits like an h\u00e9remite, // unholy of w\u00f3rkes, Went wyde in this world, // wonders to here. Strong-stress meter survives in folk poetry and in traditional chil\u00ad dren's rhymes such as \"Hickory, dickory, dock\" and was revived as an artful literary meter by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in Christabel (1816), in which each line has four strong stresses but the number of syllables within a line varies from four to twelve. What G. M. Hopkins in the later nineteenth century called his sprung rhythm is a variant of strong-stress meter: each foot, as he de\u00ad scribes it, begins with a stressed syllable, which may either stand alone or be associated with from one to three (occasionally even more) light syllables. Two six-stress lines from Hopkins' \"The Wreck of the Deutschland\" indicate the variety of the rhythms in this meter, and also exemplify its most striking feature: the great weight of the strong stresses, and the frequent juxtaposition of strong stresses (spondees) at any point in the line. The stresses in the second line were marked in a manuscript by Hopkins himself; they indicate that in complex instances, his metric decisions may seem arbitrary: The I s\u00f3ur I scythe I cringe, and the I blear I share I c\u00f3me. I Our I hearts' charity's I hearth's I fire, our I thoughts' chivalry's I throng's I Lord. I MIRACLE PLAYS, MORALITY PLAYS, AND INTERLUDES 65 (See Marcella M. Holloway The Prosodie Theory of Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1947.) A number of modern metrists, including T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, skillfully interweave both strong-stress and syllable- and-stress meters in some of their versification. (2) Quantitative meters in English are written in imitation of classical Greek and Latin versification, in which the metrical pattern is not de\u00ad termined by the stress but by the \"quantity\" (duration of pronuncia\u00ad tion) of a syllable, and the foot consists of a combination of \"long\" and \"short\" syllables. Sir Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, Thomas Campion, and other Elizabethan poets experimented with this meter in English, as did Coleridge, Tennyson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Robert Bridges later on. The strong accentual character of En\u00ad glish, however, as well as the indeterminateness of the duration of a syllable in the English language, makes it impossible to sustain a quantitative meter for any length. See Derek Attridge, Well-Weighted Syllables: Elizabethan Verse in Classical Meters (1974). (3) In free verse (discussed in a separate entry), the component lines have no (or only occasional) metric feet, or uniform stress-patterns. George Saintsbury, Historical Manual of English Prosody (1910), and R. M. Alden, English Verse (1930), are well-illustrated treatments of traditional syllable- and-stress metrics. For later discussions of this and alternative metric theories see George R. Stewart, The Technique of English Verse (1930); Seymour Chatman, A Theory of Meter (1965); and W. K. Wimsatt and Monroe C. Beardsley, \"The Concept of Meter\" (1959). This last essay is reprinted in W. K. Wimsatt, Hate\u00ad ful Contraries (1965), and in Harvey Gross, ed., The Structure of Verse (1966)\u2014 an anthology that reprints other useful essays, including Northrop Frye, \"The Rhythm of Recurrence,\" and Yvor Winters, \"The Audible Reading of Poetry.\" See also W. K. Wimsatt, ed., Versification: Major Language Types (1972); Paul Fussell, Poetic Meter and Poetic Form (rev., 1979); John Hollander, Rhyme's Rea\u00ad son: A Guide to English Verse (1981); Anthony Easthope, Poetry as Discourse (1983); T. V. F. Brogan, English Versification, 1570-1980 (1981). Miracle Plays, Morality Plays, and Interludes are types of late-me\u00ad dieval drama, written in a variety of verse forms. The miracle play had as its subject either a story from the Bible, or else the life and martyrdom of a saint. In the usage of some historians, however, \"Miracle play\" denotes only dramas based on saints' lives, and the term mys\u00ad tery play\u2014\"mystery\" in the archaic sense of the \"trade\" conducted by each of the medieval guilds who sponsored these plays\u2014is applied only to dramas based on the Bible. The plays representing biblical narratives originated within the church in about the tenth century, in dramatizations of brief parts of the Latin liturgical service, called tropes, especially the \"Quern quaeritis\" (\"Whom are you seek\u00ad ing\") trope portraying the visit of the three Marys to the tomb of Christ. Grad\u00ad ually these evolved into complete plays which were written in English instead 1 66 MIRACLE PLAYS, MORALITY PLAYS, AND INTERLUDES of in Latin, produced under the auspices of the various trade guilds, and acted on stages set outside the church. The miracle plays written in England are of unknown authorship. In the fourteenth century there developed in cities such as York and Chester the practice, on the feast of Corpus Christi (sixty days after Easter), of putting on great \"cycles\" of such plays, representing cru\u00ad cial events in the biblical history of mankind from the Creation and Fall of man, through the Nativity, Crucifixion, and Resurrection of Christ, to the Last Judgment. The precise way that the plays were staged is a matter of schol\u00ad arly debate, but it is widely agreed that each scene was played on a separate \"pageant wagon\" which was drawn, in sequence, to one after another fixed station in a city, at each of which some parts of the cycle were enacted. The biblical texts were greatly expanded in these plays, and the unknown authors added scenes, comic as well as serious, of their own invention. For examples of the variety, vitality, and power of these dramas, see the Wakefield \"Noah\" and \"Second Shepherd's Play,\" and Morality plays were dramatized allegories of a representative Christian life in the plot form of a quest for salvation, in which the crucial events are temptations, sinning, and the climactic confrontation with death. The usual protagonist represents Mankind, or Everyman; among the other characters are personifications of virtues, vices, and Death, as well as angels and demons who contest for the prize of the soul of Mankind. A character known as the Vice often played the role of the tempter in a fashion both sinister and comic; he is regarded by some literary historians as a precursor both of the cynical, ironic villain and of some of the comic figures in Elizabethan drama, includ\u00ad ing Shakespeare's Falstaff. The best-known morality play is the fifteenth- century Everyman, which is still given an occasional performance; other no\u00ad table examples, written in the same century, are The Castle of Perseverance and Mankind. Interlude (Latin, \"between the play\") is a term applied to a variety of short stage entertainments, such as secular farces and witty dialogues with a religious or political point. In the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, these little dramas were performed by bands of professional actors; it is be\u00ad lieved that they were often put on between the courses of a feast or between the acts of a longer play. Among the better-known interludes are John Hey- wood's farces of the first half of the sixteenth century, especially The Four PP (that is, the Palmer, the Pardoner, the Tothecary, and the Peddler, who en\u00ad gage in a lying contest), and Johan fohan the Husband, Tyb His Wife, and Sir John the Priest. Until the middle of the present century, concern with medieval drama was scholarly rather than critical. Since that time a number of studies have dealt with the relations of the texts to the religious and secular culture of me\u00ad dieval Europe, and have stressed the artistic excellence and power of the plays themselves. See Karl Young, The Drama of the Medieval Church (2 vols., 1933); Hardin Craig, English Religious Drama of the Middle Ages (1955); Arnold Williams, The Drama of Medieval England (1961); T. W. Craik, The Tudor Inter\u00ad lude (1962); V. Called Corpus Christi (1966); Rosemary Woolf, MODERNISM AND POSTMODERNISM 1 67 The English Mystery Plays (1972); Jerome Taylor and Alar Nelson, eds., Medieval English Drama: Essays Critical and Contextual (1972), Robert Potter, The English Morality Play (1975); David Bevington, From \"Mankind\" to Marlowe (1962). Modernism and Postmodernism. The term modernism is widely used to identify new and distinctive features in the subjects, forms, concepts, and styles of literature and the other arts in the early decades of the present cen\u00ad tury, but especially after World War I (1914-18). The specific features signified by \"modernism\" (or by the adjective modernist) vary with the user, but many critics agree that it involves a deliberate and radical break with some of the traditional bases not only of Western art, but of Western culture in general. Important intellectual precursors of modernism, in this sense, are thinkers who had questioned the certainties that had supported traditional modes of social organization, religion, and morality, and also traditional ways of con\u00ad ceiving the human self\u2014thinkers such as Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900), Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, and James G. Frazer, whose The Golden Bough (1890-1915) stressed the correspondence between central Christian tenets and pagan, often barbaric, myths and rituals. Literary historians locate the beginning of the modernist revolt as far back as the 1890s, but most agree that what is called high modernism, marked by an unexampled range and rapidity of change, came after the first World War. The year 1922 alone was signalized by the simultaneous appearance of such monuments of modernist innovation as James Joyce's Ulysses, T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land, and Virginia Woolf's Jacob's Room, as well as many other experi\u00ad mental works of literature. The catastrophe of the war had shaken faith in the moral basis, coherence, and durability of Western civilization and raised doubts about the adequacy of traditional literary modes to represent the harsh and dissonant realities of the postwar world. T. S. Eliot wrote in a review of Joyce's Ulysses in 1923 that the inherited mode of ordering a literary work, which assumed a relatively coherent and stable social order, could not accord with \"the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history.\" Like Joyce and like Ezra Pound in his Cantos, Eliot experimented with new forms and a new style that would render contemporary disorder, often contrasting it to a lost order and integration that had been based on the reli\u00ad gion and myths of the cultural past. In The Waste Land (1922), for example, Eliot replaced the standard syntactic flow of poetic language by fragmented ut\u00ad terances, and substituted for the traditional coherence of poetic structure a de\u00ad liberate dislocation of parts, in which very diverse components are related by connections that are left to the reader to discover, or invent. Major works of modernist fiction, following Joyce's Ulysses (1922) and his even more radical Finnegans Wake (1939), subvert the basic conventions of earlier prose fiction by breaking up the narrative continuity, departing from the standard ways of rep\u00ad resenting characters, and violating the traditional syntax and coherence of narrative language by the use of stream of consciousness and other innovative modes of narration. Gertrude Stein\u2014often linked with Joyce, Pound, Eliot, and Woolf as a trail-blazing modernist\u2014experimented with automatic writing 1 68 MODERNISM AND POSTMODERNISM (writing that has been freed from control by the conscious, purposive mind) and other modes that achieved their effects by violating the norms of standard English syntax and sentence structure. Among other European and American writers who are central representatives of modernism are the novelists Marcel Proust, Thomas Mann, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Franz Kafka, Dorothy Richardson, and William Faulkner; the poets St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, William Butler Yeats, Rainier Maria Rilke, Marianne Moore, William Carlos Williams, and Wallace Stevens; and the dramatists August Strindberg, Luigi Pirandello, Eugene O'Neill, and Bertolt Brecht. Their new forms of literary construction and rendering had ob\u00ad vious parallels in the violation of representational conventions in the artistic movements of expressionism and surrealism, in the modernist paintings and sculpture of Cubism, Futurism, and Abstract Expressionism, and in the viola\u00ad tions of standard conventions of melody, harmony, and rhythm by the mod\u00ad ernist musical composers Stravinsky, Schoenberg, and their radical followers. A prominent feature of modernism is the phenomenon called the avant- garde (a military metaphor: \"advance-guard\"); that is, a small, self-conscious group of artists and authors who deliberately undertake, in Ezra Pound's phrase, to \"make it new.\" By violating the accepted conventions and propri\u00ad eties, not only of art but of social discourse, they set out to create ever-new artistic forms and styles and to introduce hitherto neglected, and sometimes forbidden, subject matter. Frequently, avant-garde artists represent them\u00ad selves as \"alienated\" from the established order, against which they assert their own autonomy; a prominent aim is to shock the sensibilities of the con\u00ad ventional reader and to challenge the norms and pieties of the dominant bourgeois culture. See Renato Poggioli, The Theory of the Avant-Garde (1968). Peter Burger's Theory of the Avant-Garde (1984) is a neo-Marxist analysis both of modernism and of its distinctive cultural formation, the avant-garde. The term postmodernism is often applied to the literature and art after World War II (1939-45), when the effects on Western morale of the first war were greatly exacerbated by the experience of Nazi totalitarianism and mass extermination, the threat of total destruction by the atomic bomb, the pro\u00ad gressive devastation of the natural environment, and the ominous fact of over\u00ad population. Postmodernism involves not only a continuation, sometimes carried to an extreme, of the countertraditional experiments of modernism, but also diverse attempts to break away from modernist forms which had, in\u00ad evitably, become in their turn conventional, as well as to overthrow the elitism of modernist \"high art\" by recourse to the models of \"mass culture\" in film, television, newspaper cartoons, and popular music. Many of the works of post\u00ad modern literature\u2014by Jorge Luis Borges, Samuel Beckett, Vladimir Nabokov, Thomas Pynchon, Roland Barthes, and many others\u2014so blend literary genres, cultural and stylistic levels, the serious and the playful, that they resist classifi\u00ad cation according to traditional literary rubrics. And these literary anomalies are paralleled in other arts by phenomena like pop art, op art, the musical compo\u00ad sitions of John Cage, and the films of Jean-Luc Godard and other directors. An undertaking in some postmodernist writings\u2014prominently in Samuel Beckett and other authors of the literature of the absurd\u2014is to subvert the MOTIF AND THEME 1 69 foundations of our accepted modes of thought and experience so as to reveal the meaninglessness of existence and the underlying \"abyss,\" or \"void,\" or \"nothingness\" on which any supposed security is conceived to be precari\u00ad ously suspended. Postmodernism in literature and the arts has parallels with the movement known as poststructuralism in linguistic and literary theory; poststructuralists undertake to subvert the foundations of language in order to show that its seeming meaningfulness dissipates, for a rigorous inquirer, into a play of conflicting indeterminacies, or else to show that all forms of cultural discourse are manifestations of the ideology, or of the relations and constructions of power, in contemporary society. (See poststructuralism.) For some postmodernist developments in literature, see literature of the absurd, antihero, antinovel, Beat writers, conaete poetry, metaftction, new novel.

Worthen, Modem Drama and the Rhetoric of Theater (1992); Debora Geis, Postmodem Theatric(k)s (1993). Motif and Theme. A motif is a conspicuous element, such as a type of in\u00ad cident, device, reference, or formula, which occurs frequently in works of lit\u00ad erature. The \"loathly lady\" who turns out to be a beautiful princess is a common motif in folklore, and the man fatally bewitched by a fairy lady is a motif adopted from folklore in Keats' \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\" (1820). Common in lyric poems is the ubi sunt motif, the \"where-are\" formula for lamenting the vanished past (\"Where are the snows of yesteryear?\"), and also the carpe diem motif, whose nature is sufficiently indicated by Robert Herrick's title \"To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time.\" An aubade\u2014from the Old French \"alba,\" meaning dawn\u2014is an early-morning song whose usual motif is an urgent request to a beloved to wake up. A familiar example is Shakespeare's \"Hark, hark, the lark at heaven's gate sings.\" An older term for recurrent poetic concepts or formulas is the topos (Greek for \"a commonplace\"); Ernst R. Curtius, European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages (1953), treats many of the ancient literary topoi. The term \"motif,\" or else the German leitmotif (a guiding motif), is also applied to the 70 MYTH frequent repetition within a single work of a significant verbal or musical phrase, or set description, or complex of images, as in the operas of Richard Wagner or in novels by Thomas Mann, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and William Faulkner. See imagery; and for a deconstructive treatment of recurrent elements or motifs in prose fiction, J. Hillis Miller, Repetition and Fiction (1982). Theme is sometimes used interchangeably with \"motif,\" but the term is more usefully applied to a general concept or doctrine, whether implicit or as\u00ad serted, which an imaginative work is designed to incorporate and make per\u00ad suasive to the reader. John Milton states as the explicit theme of Paradise Lost to \"assert Eternal Providence, / And justify the ways of God to men\"; see di\u00ad dactic literature and fiction and truth. Some critics have claimed that all non- trivial works of literature, including lyric poems, involve an implicit theme which is embodied and dramatized in the evolving meanings and imagery; see, for example, Cleanth Brooks, The Well Wrought Urn (1947). And archetypal critics trace such recurrent themes as that of the scapegoat, or the journey un\u00ad derground, through myths and social rituals, as well as literature. For a dis\u00ad cussion of the overlapping applications of the critical terms \"subject,\" \"theme,\" and \"thesis\" see Monroe C. Beardsley, Aesthetics (1958), pp. 401-11. Myth. In classical Greek, \"mythos\" signified any story or plot, whether true or invented. In its central modern significance, however, a myth is one story in a mythology\u2014a system of hereditary stories of ancient origin which were once believed to be true by a particular cultural group, and which served to explain (in terms of the intentions and actions of deities and other supernat\u00ad ural beings) why the world is as it is and things happen as they do, to provide a rationale for social customs and observances, and to establish the sanctions for the rules by which people conduct their lives. Most myths are related to social rituals\u2014set forms and procedures in sacred ceremonies\u2014but anthro\u00ad pologists disagree as to whether rituals generated myths or myths generated rituals. If the protagonist is a human being rather than a supernatural being, the traditional story is usually not called a myth but a legend. If the heredi\u00ad tary story concerns supernatural beings who are not gods, and the story is not part of a systematic mythology, it is usually classified as a folktale. The French structuralist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss departed from the tradi\u00ad tional views just described, to treat the myths within each culture as signify\u00ad ing systems whose true meanings are unknown to their proponents. He analyzes the myths of a particular culture as composed of signs which are to be identified and interpreted on the model of the linguistic theory of Ferdi\u00ad nand de Saussure. See L\u00e9vi-Strauss, \"The Structural Study of in Struc\u00ad tural Anthropology (1968), and refer to structuralist criticism and semiotics. Another influential contribution to the theory of myths is the German intel\u00ad lectual historian Hans Blumenberg's Work on Myth (published 1979, translated 1985). Among other things, Blumenberg proposes that the function of myth is to help human beings cope with the inexorability of given reality, a need that is not outmoded by scientific advances and rationality; that myths MYTH 1 71 evolve according to a \"Darwinism of words,\" with those forms and variations surviving that prove able to cope most effectively with the changing social environment; and that myth is best conceived not as a collection of fixed and final stories, but as \"a work\"\u2014an ongoing and ever-changing process that is expressed in oral and written narratives and includes the diverse ways in which these narratives are received and appropriated. It can be said that a mythology is a religion in which we no longer be\u00ad lieve. Poets, however, after having ceased to believe in them, have persisted in using the myths of Jupiter, Venus, Prometheus, Wotan, Adam and Eve, and Jonah for their plots, episodes, or allusions; as Coleridge said, \"still doth the old instinct bring back the old names.\" The term \"myth\" has also been ex\u00ad tended to denote supernatural tales that are deliberately invented by their au\u00ad thors. Plato in the fourth century B.C. used such invented myths in order to project philosophical speculation beyond the point at which certain knowl\u00ad edge is possible; see, for example, his \"Myth of Er\" in Book X of The Republic. The German romantic authors R W. J. Schelling and Friedrich Schlegel pro\u00ad posed that to write great literature, modern poets must develop a new unify\u00ad ing mythology which will synthesize the insights of the myths of the Western past with the new discoveries of philosophy and the physical science. In the same period in England William Blake, who felt \"I must create a system or be enslaved by another man's,\" incorporated in his poems a system of mythol\u00ad ogy he had himself created by fusing hereditary myths, biblical history and prophecy, and his own intuitions, visions, and intellection. A number of modern writers have also asserted that an integrative mythology, whether in\u00ad herited or invented, is essential to literature. James Joyce in Ulysses and Finnegans Wake, T. S. Eliot in The Waste Land, Eugene O'Neill in Mourning Be\u00ad comes Electra, and many other writers have deliberately woven their modern materials on the pattern of ancient myths, while W. B. Yeats, like his admired predecessor Blake, undertook to construct his own systematic mythology, which he expounded in A Vision (1926) and embodied in a number of re\u00ad markable lyric poems such as \"The Second Coming\" and \"Byzantium.\" \"Myth\" is a prominent term in literary analysis. A large group of writers, the myth critics\u2014including Robert Graves, Francis Fergusson, Maud Bodkin, Richard Chase, and (the most influential) Northrop Frye\u2014view the genres and individual plot-patterns of many works of literature, including what on the surface are highly sophisticated and realistic works, as recurrences of basic mythic formulas. As Northrop Frye put it, \"the typical forms of myth become the conventions and genres of literature.\" According to Frye's theory, there are four main narrative genres\u2014comedy, romance, tragedy, and irony (satire)\u2014and these are \"displaced\" modes of the four elemental forms of myth that are associated with the seasonal cycle of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. (See archetypal criticism and genre.) A reader needs to be alert to the bewildering variety of applications of the term \"myth\" in contemporary criticism. In addition to those already de\u00ad scribed, its uses range all the way from signifying any widely held fallacy (\"the myth of progress'\" \"the American success myth\") to denoting the solidly 1 72 NARRATION, GRAMMAR OF imagined realm within which a fictional narrative is enacted (\"Faulkner's myth of Yoknapatawpha County,\" \"the mythical world of Moby-Dick\"). On classical mythology see H. J. Rose, A Handbook of Greek Mythology (1939), and on the use of classical myths in English literature, Douglas Vin\u00ad cent Bush, Mythology and the Renaissance Tradition in English Poetry (rev. ed., 1963) and Mythology and the Romantic Tradition in English Poetry (rev. ed., 1969). Among studies of myths especially influential for modern literature and criticism are James G. Frazer, The Golden Bough (rev., 1911); Jessie L. We\u00ad ston, From Ritual to Romance (1920); Jane E. Harrison, Themis (2d ed., 1927); F. R. R. S. Raglan, The Hero (1936). On myth criticism, see William Righter, Myth and Literature (1975); and for instances of the theory and practice of myth criticism, Francis Fergusson, The Idea of a Theater (1949); Richard Chase, Quest for Myth (1949); Philip Wheelwright, The Burning Fountain (1954); Leslie Fiedler, Love and Death in the American Novel (1960); John B. Vickery, ed., Myth and Literature (1966); Northrop Frye, Anatomy of Criticism (1957) and \"Litera\u00ad ture and Myth\" in Relations of Literary Study, ed. James Thorpe (1967). This last essay has a useful bibliography of the theory and history of myths, as well as of major exponents of myth criticism. Narration, Grammar of. The analysis of special grammatical usages that are characteristic of fictional narratives. The systematic study of the grammar of narration was begun by K\u00e4te Hamburger in The Logic of Literature (1957, trans. 1973). One focus of such analysis is the special play of deictics\u2014that is, of words verbs\u2014whose reference depends on the particular speaker and his or her position in place and time. In many narratives, usually in a way not explicitly noted by the reader, the references of such terms constantly shift or merge, as the narration moves from the narrator, by whom the events are told in the past tense (e.g., then and there), to a character in the narration, for whom the action is present (e.g., here and now). Another notable grammatical usage has been called free indirect discourse (equivalent to the French \"style indirect libre\"), or \"represented speech and thought.\" These terms refer to the way, in many narratives, that the reports of what a character says and thinks shift in pronouns, adverbs, tense, and grammatical mode, as we move\u2014or sometimes hover\u2014between the direct narrated reproductions of these events as they occur to the character and the indirect representation of such events by the narrator. Thus, a direct representation, \"He thought, will see her home now, and may then stop at my mother's/\" might shift, in an \"in\u00ad direct representation,\" to \"He thought that he would see her home and then maybe stop at his mother's.\" In a \"free indirect representation\" the sentence might change to \"He would see her home then, and might afterward stop at his mother's.\" Refer to narrative and nanatology, and see Roy Pascal, The Dual Voice: Free Indirect Speech and Its Functioning in the Nineteenth-Century European Novel (1977); Dorrit Cohn, Transparent Minds: Narrative Modes for Presenting Conscious\u00ad ness in Fiction (1978); Ann Banfield, Unspeakable Sentences: Narration and Repre\u00ad sentation in the Language of Fiction (1982). NARRATIVE AND NARRATOLOGY 173 Narrative and Narratology. A narrative is a story, whether told in prose or verse, involving events, characters, and what the characters say and do. Some literary forms such as the novel and short story in prose, and the epic and ro\u00ad mance in verse, are explicit narratives that are told by a narrator. In drama, the narrative is not told, but evolves by means of the direct presentation on stage of the actions and speeches of the characters. It should be noted that there is an implicit narrative element even in many lyric poems. In William Wordsworth's \"The Solitary Reaper,\" for example, we infer from what the lyric speaker says that, coming unexpectedly in the Scottish Highlands upon a girl reaping and singing, he stops, attends, meditates, and then continues his climb up the hill. Narratology denotes recent concerns with the general theory and prac\u00ad tice of narrative in all literary forms. It deals especially with types of narrators, the identification of structural elements and their diverse modes of combina\u00ad tion, recurrent narrative devices, and the analysis of the kinds of discourse by which a narrative gets told, as well as with the narratee\u2014that is, the explicit or implied person or audience to whom the narrator addresses the narrative. Current narratological theory picks up and elaborates upon many topics in traditional treatments of fictional narratives, from Aristotle's Poetics in the fourth century B.C. to Wayne Booth's The Rhetoric of Fiction (1961); current theory, however, applies to such topics concepts and analytic procedures which derive from recent developments in Russian formalism and especially in French structuralism. Narcologists, accordingly, do not treat a narrative in the traditional way, as a fictional representation of life, but as a systematic for\u00ad mal construction. A primary interest of structural narratologists is in the way that narrative discourse fashions a story\u2014the mere sequence of events in time\u2014into the organized and meaningful structure of a literary plot. (The Russian formalists had made a parallel distinction between the fabula\u2014the elemental materials of a story\u2014and the syuzhet, the concrete representation used to convey the story.) The general undertaking is to determine the rules, or codes of composition, that are manifested by the diverse forms of plot, and also to formulate the \"grammar\" of narrative in terms of structures and narra\u00ad tive formulae that recur in many stories, whatever the differences in the nar\u00ad rated subject matters. In Narrative Discourse (1980), followed by Figures of Literary Discourse (1982), the French structuralist critic G\u00e9rard Genette pre\u00ad sented influential analyses of the complex interrelations between a story and the types of discourse in which the story is narrated, and greatly subtilized the treatment of point of view in narrative fiction. Hayden White is a historian who sets out to demonstrate that the narra\u00ad tives written by historians are not simple representations of a sequence of facts, nor the revelation of a design inherent in events. Instead, White ana\u00ad lyzes historical narratives as shaped by the imposition on events of cultural patterns similar to the narratological, archetypal, and other structural concepts that had been applied in the criticism of literature; see his Metahistory (1973) and The Content of the Form: Narrative Discourse and Historical Representation (1987). The philosopher W B. Gallie has written an influential book on the kind of explanation and understanding that, in the writing of history, is 1 74 NEGATIVE CAPABILITY \u00b7 NEOCLASSIC AND ROMANTIC achieved by narration rather than by propositional statements and logical ar\u00ad guments; see W. B. Gallie, Philosophy and the Historical Understanding (1964); also Arthur C. Danto, Nanation and Knowledge (1985). A book which did much to inaugurate modern narratology was The Mor\u00ad phology of the Folktale by the Russian formalist Vladimir Propp (trans., 1970). For later developments in narrative theory see, in addition to Genette (above), Tzvetan Todorov, The Poetics of Prose (trans., 1977); Seymour Chatman, Story and Discourse: Nanative Structure in Fiction and Film (1978); Robert Alters, The Art of Biblical Nanative (1981); Wallace Martin, Recent Theories of Nanative (1986); Gerald Prince, A Dictionary ofNanatology (1987); Nanative (3 vols., 1984-88); Mieke Bal, Nanatology: Introduction to the Theory of Nanative (rev. ed., 1997). In recent years, some cognitive psycholo\u00ad gists and literary and cultural theorists have proposed that narrative, or the telling of diverse \"stories\" about how one thing leads to another, is the basic means by which we make sense of the world, provide meaning to our experi\u00ad ences, and organize our lives. See Jerome Bruner, Acts of Meaning (1990), and Actual Worlds, Possible Minds (1986); and Mark Turner, The Literary Mind (1996). For recent narratological contributions to older analyses of how a story gets told, see point of view. Negative Capability. The poet John Keats introduced this term in a letter written in December 1817 to define a literary quality \"which Shakespeare possessed so enormously\u2014I mean Negative Capability, that is, when man is ca\u00ad pable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reach\u00ad ing after fact and reason.\" Keats contrasted to this quality the writing of Coleridge, who \"would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude .. . from being incapable of remaining content with half knowledge,\" and went on to express the general principle \"that with a great poet the sense of beauty over comes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.\" The elusive term has entered critical circulation and has accumulated a large body of commentary. When conjoined with observations in other let\u00ad ters by Keats, \"negative capability\" can be taken (1) to characterize an imper\u00ad sonal, or objective, author who maintains aesthetic distance, as opposed to a subjective author who is personally involved with the characters and actions represented in a work of literature, and as opposed also to an author who uses a literary work to present and to make persuasive his or her personal beliefs; and (2) to suggest that, when embodied in a beautiful artistic form, the liter\u00ad ary subject matter, concepts, and characters are not subject to the ordinary standards of evidence, truth, and morality, as we apply these standards in the course of our practical experience. Refer to distance and involvement and objective and subjective. On the diverse interpretations of Keats' \"negative capability,\" see W. J. Bate, John Keats (1963). Neoclassic and Romantic. The simplest use of these extremely variable terms is as noncommittal names for periods of literature. In this application, the \"Neoclassic Period\" in England spans the 140 years or so after the NEOCLASSIC AND ROMANTIC 1 75 Restoration (1660), and the \"Romantic Period\" is usually taken to extend ap\u00ad proximately from the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789\u2014or alter\u00ad natively, from the publication of Lyrical Ballads in 1798\u2014through the first three decades of the nineteenth century. With reference to American litera\u00ad ture, the term \"neoclassic\" is rarely applied to eighteenth-century writers; on the other hand, 1830-65, the era of Emerson, Thoreau, Poe, Melville, and Hawthorne, is sometimes called \"the American Romantic Period.\" (See peri\u00ad ods of English literature and periods of American literature.) The same terms are frequently applied to periods of German, French, and other Continental lit\u00ad eratures, but with differences in the historical spans they identify. Historians have often tried to \"define\" neoclassicism or romanticism, as though each term denoted a single essential feature which was shared, to varying degrees, by all the major writings of an age. But the course of literary events has not formed itself around such simple entities, and the numerous and conflicting single definitions of neoclassicism and romanticism are either so vague as to be next to meaningless or so specific as to fall far short of equat\u00ad ing with the great range and variety of the literary phenomena. A more useful undertaking is simply to specify salient attributes of literary theory and prac\u00ad tice that were shared by a number of important writers in the Neoclassic Pe\u00ad riod in England, and that serve to distinguish them from many outstanding writers of the Romantic Period. The following list of ideas and characteristics that were shared, between 1660 and the late 1700s, by authors such as John Dryden, Alexander Pope, Joseph Addison, Jonathan Swift, Samuel Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, and Edmund Burke, may serve as an introductory sketch of some prominent features of neoclassic literature: (1) These authors exhibited a strong traditionalism, which was often joined to a distrust of radical innovation and was evidenced above all in their great respect for classical writers\u2014that is, the writers of an\u00ad cient Greece and Rome\u2014who were thought to have achieved excel\u00ad lence, and established the enduring models, in all the major literary genres. Hence the term \"neoclassic.\" (It is from this high estimate of the literary achievements of classical antiquity that the term \"a clas\u00ad sic\" has come to be applied to any later literary work that is widely agreed to have achieved excellence and to have set a standard in its kind. See the entry canon of literature and T. S. Eliot's What Is a Classic? (1945). (2) Literature was conceived to be primarily an \"art\"; that is, a set of skills which, though it requires innate talents, must be perfected by long study and practice and consists mainly in the deliberate adaptation of known and tested means to the achievement of foreseen ends upon the audience of readers. The neoclassic ideal, founded especially on Horace's Roman Ars Poetica (first century B.C.), is the craftsman's ideal, demanding finish, correction, and attention to detail. Special al\u00ad lowances were often made for the unerring freedom of what were called natural geniuses, and also for happy strokes, available even to NEOCLASSIC AND ROMANTIC some less gifted poets, which occur without premeditation and achieve, as Alexander Pope said (in his deft and comprehensive sum\u00ad mary of neoclassic principles An Essay on Criticism, 1711), \"a grace be\u00ad yond the reach of art.\" But the prevailing view was that a natural genius such as Homer or Shakespeare is extremely rare, and probably a thing of the past, and that to even the best of artful poets, literary \"graces\" come only occasionally. The representative neoclassic writer commonly strove, therefore, for \"correctness,\" was careful to observe the complex demands of stylistic decorum, and for the most part re\u00ad spected the established \"rules\" of his art. The neoclassic rules of po\u00ad etry were, in theory, the essential properties of the various genres (such as epic, tragedy, comedy, pastoral) that have been abstracted from classical works whose long survival has proved their excellence. Such properties, many critics believed, must be embodied in modern works if these too are to be excellent and to survive. In England, how\u00ad ever, many critics were dubious about some of the rules accepted by Italian and French critics, and opposed the strict application of rules such as the three unities in drama. (3) Human beings, and especially human beings as an integral part of a social organization, were regarded as the primary subject matter of lit\u00ad erature. Poetry was held to be an imitation of human life\u2014in a com\u00ad mon phrase, \"a mirror held up to nature.\" And by the human actions it imitates, and the artistic form it gives to the imitation, poetry is de\u00ad signed to yield both instruction and aesthetic pleasure to the people who read it. Not art for art's sake, but art for humanity's sake, was a central ideal of neoclassic humanism. (4) Both in the subject matter and the appeal of art, emphasis was placed on what human beings possess in common\u2014representative character\u00ad istics and widely shared experiences, thoughts, feelings, and tastes. \"True wit\" Pope said in a much-quoted passage of his Essay on Criti\u00ad cism, is \"what oft was thought but ne'er so well expressed.\" That is, a primary aim of poetry is to give new and consummate expression to the great commonplaces of human wisdom, whose prevalence and durability are the best warrant of their importance and truth. Some critics also insisted, it should be noted, on the need to balance or en\u00ad hance the general, typical, and familiar with the opposing qualities of novelty, particularity, and invention. Samuel Johnson substituted for Pope's definition of true wit the statement that wit \"is at once natural and new\" and praised Shakespeare because, while his characters are species, they are all \"discriminated\" and \"distinct.\" But there was wide agreement that the general nature and shared values of humanity are the basic source and test of art, and also that the fact of universal human agreement, everywhere and always, is the best test of moral and religious truths, as well as of aesthetic values. (Compare deism.) (5) Neoclassic writers, like the major philosophers of the time, viewed human beings as limited agents who ought to set themselves only NEOCLASSIC AND ROMANTIC 1 77 accessible goals. Many of the great works of the period, satiric and di\u00ad dactic, attack human \"pride,\" or presumption beyond the natural limits of the species, and enforce the lesson of the golden mean (the avoidance of extremes) and of humanity's need to submit to its re\u00ad stricted position in the cosmic order\u2014an order sometimes envisioned as a natural hierarchy, or Great Chain of Being. In art, as in life, what was for the most part praised was the law of measure and the accep\u00ad tance of limits upon one's freedom. The poets admired extremely the great genres of epic and tragedy, but wrote their own masterpieces in admittedly lesser and less demanding forms such as the essay in verse and prose, the comedy of manners, and especially satire, in which they felt they had more chance to equal or surpass their classical and English predecessors. They submitted to at least some \"rules\" and other limiting conventions in literary subjects, structure, and diction. Typical was their choice, in many poems, to write within the ex\u00ad tremely tight limits of the closed couplet. But a distinctive quality of the urbane poetry of the Neoclassic Period was, in the phrase often quoted from Horace, \"the art that hides art\"; that is, the seeming free\u00ad dom and ease with which, at its best, it meets the challenge set by tra\u00ad ditional and highly restrictive patterns. Here are some aspects in which romantic aims and achievements, in many prominent and innovative writers during the late eighteenth and early nine\u00ad teenth centuries, differ most conspicuously from their neoclassic precursors: (1) The prevailing attitude favored innovation over traditionalism in the materials, forms, and style of literature. Wordsworth's preface to the second edition of Lyrical Ballads in 1800 was written as a poetic \"man\u00ad ifesto,\" or statement of revolutionary aims, in which he denounced the upper-class subjects and the poetic diction of the preceding century and proposed to deal with materials from \"common life\" in \"a selec\u00ad tion of language really used by men.\" Wordsworth's serious or tragic treatment of lowly subjects in common language violated the basic neoclassic rule of decorum, which asserted that the serious genres should deal only with the momentous actions of royal or aristocratic characters in an appropriately elevated style. Other innovations in the period were the exploitation by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, and others of the realm of the supernatural and of \"the far away and the long ago\"; the assumption by William Blake, William Wordsworth, and Percy Bysshe Shelley of the persona of a poet- prophet who writes a visionary mode of poetry; and the use of poetic symbolism (especially by Blake and Shelley) deriving from a worldview in which objects are charged with a significance beyond their physi\u00ad cal qualities. \"I always seek in what I see,\" as Shelley said, \"the like\u00ad ness of something beyond the present and tangible object.\" (2) In his preface to Lyrical Ballads, Wordsworth repeatedly declared that good poetry is \"the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings.\" 1 78 NEOCLASSIC AND ROMANTIC According to this view poetry is not primarily a mirror of men in ac\u00ad tion; on the contrary, its essential component is the poet's own feel\u00ad ings, while the process of composition, since it is \"spontaneous,\" is the opposite of the artful manipulation of means to foreseen ends stressed by the neoclassic critics. (See expressive criticism.) Wordsworth carefully qualified this radical doctrine by describing his poetry as \"emotion recollected in tranquility,\" and by specifying that a poet's spontaneity is the result of a prior process of deep reflection and may be followed by second thoughts and revisions. But the immediate act of composition, if a poem is to be genuine, must be spontaneous\u2014 that is, unforced, and free of what Wordsworth decried as the \"artifi\u00ad cial\" rules and conventions of his neoclassic predecessors. \"If poetry comes not as naturally as the leaves to a tree,\" Keats wrote, \"it had better not Coleridge substi\u00ad tuted for neoclassic \"rules,\" which he describes as imposed on the poet from without, the concept of the inherent organic \"laws\" of the poet's imagination; that is, he conceives that each poetic work, like a growing plant, evolves according to its own internal principles into its final organic form. (3) To a remarkable degree external nature\u2014the landscape, together with its flora and fauna\u2014became a persistent subject of poetry, and was de\u00ad scribed with an accuracy and sensuous nuance unprecedented in ear\u00ad lier writers. It is a mistake, however, to describe the romantic poets as simply \"nature poets.\" While many major poems by Wordsworth and Coleridge\u2014and to a great extent by Shelley and Keats\u2014set out from and return to an aspect or change of aspect in the landscape, the outer scene is not presented for its own sake but only as a stimulus for the poet to engage in the most characteristic human activity, that of thinking. Representative romantic works are in fact poems of feeling- ful meditation which, though often stimulated by a natural phenom\u00ad enon, are concerned with central human experiences and problems. Wordsworth asserted, in what he called a \"Prospectus\" to his major poems, that it is \"the Mind of Man\" which is \"My haunt, and the main region of my song.\" (4) Neoclassic poetry was about other people, but much of romantic po\u00ad etry invited the reader to identify the protagonists with the poets themselves, either directly, as in Wordsworth's Prelude (1805; revised 1850) and a number of romantic lyric poems (see lyric), or in altered but recognizable form, as in Lord Byron's Childe Harold (1812-18). In prose we find a parallel vogue in the revealingly personal essays of Charles Lamb and William Hazlitt and in a number of spiritual and intellectual autobiographies: Thomas De Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium (1833-34). And whether romantic subjects were the poets them\u00ad selves or other people, they were no longer represented as part of an NEOCLASSIC AND ROMANTIC organized society but, typically, as solitary figures engaged in a long, and sometimes infinitely elusive, quest; often they were also social nonconformists or outcasts. Many important romantic works had as protagonist the isolated rebel, whether for good or ill: Prometheus, Cain, the Wandering Jew, the Satanic hero-villain, or the great outlaw. (5) What seemed to a number of political liberals the infinite social promise of the French Revolution in the early 1790s, fostered the sense in writers of the early Romantic Period that theirs was a great age of new beginnings and high possibilities. Many writers viewed a human being as endowed with limitless aspiration toward the infinite good envisioned by the faculty of imagination. \"Our destiny,\" Wordsworth says in a visionary moment in The Prelude, \"our being's heart and home, / Is with infinitude, and only there,\" and our desire is for \"something evermore about to \"Less satisfy man.\" Humanity's undaunted aspi\u00ad rations beyond its assigned limits, which to the neoclassic moralist had been its tragic error of generic \"pride,\" now became humanity's glory and a mode of triumph, even in failure, over the pettiness of cir\u00ad cumstance. In a parallel way, the typical neoclassic judgment that the highest art is the perfect achievement of limited aims gave way to a dissatisfaction with rules and inherited restrictions. According to a number of romantic writers, the highest art consists in an endeavor beyond finite human possibility; as a result, neoclassical satisfaction in the perfectly accomplished, because limited, enterprise was re\u00ad placed in writers such as Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Shelley, by a preference for the glory of the imperfect, in which the artist's very failure attests the grandeur of his aim. Also, Romantic writers once more entered into competition with their greatest predecessors in audacious long poems in the most exacting genres: Wordsworth's Prelude (a rerendering, at epic length and in the form of a spiritual au\u00ad tobiography, of central themes of John Byron's ironic conspectus of modern European civilization, Don Juan.

Enscoe, eds., Romanticism: Points of View (rev., 1975). In Poetic Form and British Romanticism (1986), Stuart Curran stresses the relationship of innovative Romantic forms to the tradi\u00ad tional poetic genres. New Criticism. This term, set current by the publication of John Crowe Ransom's The New Criticism in 1941, came to be applied to a theory and prac\u00ad tice that was prominent in American literary criticism until late in the 1960s. The movement derived in considerable part from elements in I. A Richards' Principles of Literary Criticism (1924) and Practical Criticism (1929) and from the critical essays of T. S. Eliot. It opposed the prevailing interest of scholars, critics, and teachers of that era in the biographies of authors, the social con\u00ad text of literature, and literary history by insisting that the proper concern of literary criticism is not with the external circumstances or effects or historical position of a work, but with a detailed consideration of the work itself as an independent entity. Notable critics in this mode were the southerners Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren, whose textbooks Understanding Po\u00ad etry (1938) and Understanding Fiction (1943) did much to make the New Criti\u00ad cism the predominant method of teaching literature in American colleges, and even in high schools, for the next two or three decades. Other prominent writers of that time\u2014in addition to Ransom, Brooks, and Warren\u2014who are often identified as New Critics are Allen Tate, R. P. Blackmur, and William K. Wimsatt. A very influential English critic, E R. Leavis, in turning his attention from background, sources, and biography to the detailed analysis of \"literary texts themselves,\" shared some of the concepts of the New Critics and their ana\u00ad lytic focus on what he called \"the words on the page.\" He differed from his American counterparts, however, in his emphasis on the great literary works as a concrete and life-affirming enactment of moral and cultural values; he stressed also the essential role in education of what he called \"the Great Tradition\" of English literature in advancing the values of culture and \"civi\u00ad lization\" against the antagonistic forces in modern life. See E R. Leavis, Reval\u00ad uation: Tradition and Development in English Poetry (1936); Education and the University (1943, 2d ed. 1948); The Great Tradition: George Eliot, Henry fames, Joseph Conrad (1948); also Anne Sampson, F. R. Leavis (1992). The New Critics differ from one another in many ways, but the following points of view and procedures are common to many of them. NEW CRITICISM 181 (1) A poem, it is held, should be treated as such\u2014in Eliot's words, \"pri\u00ad marily as poetry and not another thing\"\u2014and should therefore be re\u00ad garded as an independent and self-sufficient verbal object. The first law of criticism, John Crowe Ransom said, \"is that it shall be objec\u00ad tive, shall cite the nature of the object\" and shall recognize \"the au\u00ad tonomy of the work itself as existing for its own sake.\" (See objective cr\u00ecticism.) New Critics warn the reader against critical practices which divert attention from the poem itself (see intentional fallacy and affec\u00ad tive fallacy). In analyzing and evaluating a particular work, they es\u00ad chew reference to the biography and temperament of the author, to the social conditions at the time of its production, or to its psycho\u00ad logical and moral effects on the reader; they also tend to minimize re\u00ad course to the place of the work in the history of literary forms and subject matter. Because of this critical focus on the literary work in isolation from its attendant circumstances and effects, the New Criti\u00ad cism is often classified as a type of critical formalism. (2) The principles of the New Criticism are basically verbal. That is, liter\u00ad ature is conceived to be a special kind of language whose attributes are defined by systematic opposition to the language of science and of practical and logical discourse, and the explicative procedure is to analyze the meanings and interactions of words, figures of speech, and symbols. The emphasis is on the \"organic unity,\" in a successful liter\u00ad ary work, of overall structure and verbal meanings, and we are warned against separating the two by what Cleanth Brooks has called \"the heresy of paraphrase.\" (3) The distinctive procedure of a New Critic is explication, or close reading: the detailed analysis of the complex interrelations and am\u00ad biguities (multiple meanings) of the verbal and figurative components within a work. \"Explication de texte\" (stressing all kinds of informa\u00ad tion relevant to the full understanding of a word or passage) has long been a formal procedure for teaching literature in French schools, but the kind of explicative analyses of verbal interactions characteristic of the New Criticism derives from such books as I. A. Richards' Practical Cr\u00ecticism (1929) and William Empson's Seven Types of Ambiguity (1930). (4) The distinction between literary genres, although acknowledged, does not play an essential role in the New Criticism. The essential compo\u00ad nents of any work of literature, whether lyric, narrative, or dramatic, are conceived to be words, images, and symbols rather than character, thought, and plot. These linguistic elements, whatever the genre, are often said to be organized around a central and humanly significant theme, and to manifest high literary value to the degree that they manifest \"tension,\" \"irony,\" and \"paradox\" in achieving a \"reconcilia\u00ad tion of diverse impulses\" or an \"equilibrium of opposed forces.\" The form of a work, whether or not it has characters and plot, is said to be primarily a \"structure of meanings,\" which evolve into an integral 1 82 NEW HISTORICISM and freestanding unity mainly through a play and counterplay of \"thematic imagery\" and \"symbolic action.\" The basic orientation and modes of analysis in the New Criticism were adapted to the contextual criticism of Eliseo Vivas and Murray Krieger. Krieger defined contextualism as \"the claim that the poem is a tight, com\u00ad pelling, finally closed context,\" which prevents \"our escape to the world of reference and action beyond,\" and requires that we \"judge the work's efficacy as an aesthetic object.\" (See Krieger, The New Apologists for Poetry, 1956, and Theory of Criticism, 1976.) The revolutionary thrust of the mode had lost much of its force by the 1960s, when it gave way to various newer theories of criticism, but it has left a deep and enduring mark on the criticism and teach\u00ad ing of literature, in its primary emphasis on the individual work and in the variety and subtlety of the devices that it made available for analyzing its internal relations. Lyric Poetry: Beyond New Criticism, ed. Chavira Hosek and Patricia Parker (1985), is a collection of structuralist, poststructuralist, and other essays which\u2014often in express opposition to the New Criticism\u2014exemplify the diverse newer modes of \"close reading\"; some of these essays emphasize that competing forces within the language of a lyric poem preclude the possi\u00ad bility of a unified meaning. Central instances of the theory and practice of New Criticism are Cleanth Brooks, The Well Wrought Urn (1947), and W. K. Wimsatt, The Verbal Icon (1954). The enterprises of New Criticism are privileged over alternative ap\u00ad proaches to literature in Ren\u00e9 Wellek and Austin Warren, Theory of Literature (3d ed., 1964), which became a standard reference book in the graduate study of literature. Robert W. Stallman's Critiques and Essays in Criticism, 1920-1948 (1949) is a convenient collection of essays in this critical mode; the literary journal The Explicator (1942 ff.), devoted to close reading, is a characteristic product of its approach to literary texts, as are the items listed in Poetry Expli\u00ad cation: A Checklist of Interpretation Since 1924 of British and American Poems Past and Present, ed. Joseph M. Kuntz (3d ed., 1980). See also W. K. Wimsatt, ed., Explication as Criticism (1963); the review of the movement by Ren\u00e9 Wellek, A History of Modern Criticism, Vol. 6 (1986); and the spirited retrospective de\u00ad fense of New Criticism by its chief exponent, Cleanth Brooks, \"In Search of the New Criticism\" (1983), reprinted in Brooks, Community, Religion, and Liter\u00ad ature, 1995). For critiques of the theory and methods of the New Criticism, see R. S. Crane, ed., Critics and Criticism, Ancient and Modern (1952), and The Lan\u00ad guages of Criticism and the Structure of Poetry (1953); Gerald Graff, Poetic State\u00ad ment and Critical Dogma (1970); Terry Eagleton, Literary Theory: An Introduction (1993); Susan Wolfson, Formal Charges (1997). New Historicism, since the early 1980s, has been the accepted name for a mode of literary study that its proponents oppose to the formalism they at\u00ad tribute both to the New Criticism and to the critical deconstruction that fol\u00ad lowed it. In place of dealing with a text in isolation from its historical context, new historicists attend primarily to the historical and cultural conditions of NEW HISTORICISM 1 83 its production, its meanings, its effects, and also of its later critical interpreta\u00ad tions and evaluations. This is not simply a return to an earlier kind of literary scholarship, for the views and practices of the new historicists differ markedly from those of former scholars who had adverted to social and intellectual his\u00ad tory as a \"background\" against which to set a work of literature as an inde\u00ad pendent entity, or had viewed literature as a \"reflection\" of the worldview characteristic of a period. Instead, new historicists conceive of a literary text as \"situated\" within the institutions, social practices, and discourses that con\u00ad stitute the overall culture of a particular time and place, and with which the literary text interacts as both a product and a producer of cultural energies and codes. What is most distinctive in the new mode of historical study is mainly the result of concepts and practices of literary analysis and interpretation that have been assimilated from various recent poststructural theorists (see post- structuralism). Especially prominent are (1) The views of the revisionist Marx\u00ad ist thinker, Louis Althusser, that ideology manifests itself in different ways in the discourse of each of the semi-autonomous institutions of an era, includ\u00ad ing literature, and also that ideology operates covertly to form and position the users of language as the \"subjects\" in a discourse, in a way that in fact \"subjects\" them\u2014that is, subordinates them\u2014to the interests of the ruling classes; see ideology under Marxist criticism. (2) Michel Foucault's view that the discourse of an era, instead of reflecting preexisting entities and orders, brings into being the concepts, oppositions, and hierarchies of which it speaks; that these elements are both products and propagators of \"power,\" or social forces; and that as a result, the particular discursive formations of an era determine what is at the time accounted \"knowledge\" and \"truth,\" as well as what is considered to be humanly normal as against what is considered to be crimi\u00ad nal, or insane, or sexually deviant. (3) The central concept in deconstructive criticism that all texts involve modes of signification that war against each other, merged with Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of the dialogic nature of many literary texts, in the sense that they incorporate a number of conflicting voices that represent diverse social classes; see dialogic criticism. (4) Recent de\u00ad velopments in cultural anthropology, especially Clifford Geertz' view that a culture is constituted by distinctive sets of signifying systems, and his use of what he calls thick descriptions\u2014the close analysis, or \"reading,\" of a partic\u00ad ular social production or event so as to recover the meanings it has for the people involved in it, as well as to discover, within the cultural system, the general patterns of conventions, codes, and modes of thinking that invest the item with those meanings. In an oft-quoted phrase, Louis Montrose described the new historicism as \"a reciprocal concern with the historicity of texts and the textuality of his\u00ad tory.\" That is, history is conceived not to be a set of fixed, objective facts but, like the literature with which it interacts, a text which itself needs to be inter\u00ad preted. Any text, on the other hand, is conceived as a discourse which, al\u00ad though it may seem to present, or reflect, an external reality, in fact consists of what are called representations\u2014that is, verbal formations which are the 1 84 NEW HISTORICISM \"ideological products\" or \"cultural constructs\" of the historical conditions specific to an era. New historicists often claim also that these cultural and ide\u00ad ological representations in texts serve mainly to reproduce, confirm, and propagate the power-structures of domination and subordination which char\u00ad acterize a given society. Despite their common perspective on the contextualism of literature with other components of culture, we find considerable diversity and dis\u00ad agreements among individual exponents of the new historicism. The follow\u00ad ing proposals, however, occur frequently in their writings, sometimes in an extreme and sometimes in a qualified form. All of them are formulated in op\u00ad position to views that, according to many new historicists, were central ideo\u00ad logical constructs in traditional literary criticism. A number of historicists assign the formative period of these traditional views to the early era of capi\u00ad talism in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. (1) Literature does not occupy a \"trans-historical\" aesthetic realm which is independent of the economic, social, and political conditions spe\u00ad cific to an era, nor is literature subject to timeless criteria of artistic value. Instead, a literary text is simply one of many kinds of texts\u2014re\u00ad ligious, philosophical, legal, scientific, and so on\u2014all of which are formed and structured by the particular conditions of a time and place, and among which the literary text has neither unique status nor special privilege. A related fallacy of mainstream criticism, ac\u00ad cording to new historicists, was to view a literary text as an au\u00ad tonomous body of fixed meanings that cohere to form an organic whole in which all conflicts are artistically resolved. On the contrary, it is claimed, many literary texts consist of a diversity of dissonant voices, and these voices express not only the orthodox, but also the subordinated and subversive forces of the era in which the text was produced. Furthermore, what may seem to be the artistic resolution of a literary plot, yielding pleasure to the reader, is in fact deceptive, for it is an effect that serves to cover over the unresolved conflicts of power, class, gender, and diverse social groups that make up the real tensions that underlie the surface meanings of a literary text. (2) History is not a homogeneous and stable pattern of facts and events which can be used as the \"background\" to the literature of an era, or which literature can be said simply to reflect, or which can be ad\u00ad verted to (as in early Marxist criticism) as the \"material\" conditions that, in a unilateral way, determine the particularities of a literary text. In contrast to such views, a literary text is said by new histori\u00ad cists to be \"embedded\" in its context, and in a constant interaction and interchange with other components inside the network of insti\u00ad tutions, beliefs, and cultural power-relations, practices, and products that, in their ensemble, constitute what we call history. New histori\u00ad cists commonly regard even the conceptual \"boundaries\" by which we currently discriminate between literature and non-literary texts to NEW HISTORICISM be a construct of post-Renaissance ideological formations. They con\u00ad tinue to make use of such discriminations, but only for tactical con\u00ad venience in conducting critical discussion, and stress that one must view all such boundaries as entirely permeable to interchanges of di\u00ad verse elements and forces. Favored terms for such interchanges\u2014 whether among the modes of discourse within a single literary text, or among diverse kinds of texts, or between a text and its institutional and cultural context\u2014are \"negotiation,\" \"commerce,\" \"exchange,\" \"trans\u00ad action,\" and \"circulation.\" not only to denote the two-way, oscillatory relationships among literary and other components of a culture, but also to indicate, by their obvious origin in the monetary discourse of the marketplace, the degree to which the op\u00ad erations and values of modern consumer capitalism saturate literary and aesthetic, as well as all other social institutions and relations. As Stephen Greenblatt has expressed such a view, the \"negotiation\" that results in the production and circulation of a work of art involves a \"mutually profitable exchange\"\u2014including \"a return normally meas\u00ad \"the society's money invariably (\"Toward a Poetics of Culture,\" in The New Histor\u00eccism, ed. H. Aram Veeser, 1989.) (3) The humanistic concept of an essential human nature that is common to the author of a literary work, the characters within the work, and the audience the author writes for, is another of the widely held ideo\u00ad logical illusions that, according to many new historicists, were gener\u00ad ated primarily by a capitalist culture (see humanism). They also attribute to this \"bourgeois\" and \"essentialist humanism\" the view that a literary work is the imaginative creation of a free, or \"au\u00ad tonomous,\" author who possesses a unified, unique, and enduring personal identity. In the epilogue o\u00ed Renaissance Self-Fashioning (1980) Stephen Greenblatt says that, in the course of writing the book, he lost his initial confidence in \"the role of human autonomy,\" for \"the human subject itself began to seem remarkably unfree, the ideologi\u00ad cal product of the relations of power in a particular society.\" An area of contest among new historicists is the extent to which an author, despite being a subject who is constructed and positioned by the play of power and ideology within the discourse of a particular era, may retain some scope for individual initiative and \"agency.\" Those his\u00ad toricists who ascribe a degree of freedom and initiative to an individ\u00ad ual author usually do so, however, not as in traditional criticism, in order to account for an author's literary invention and distinctive artistry, but in order to keep open the theoretical possibility that an individual author can intervene so as to inaugurate radical changes in the social power-structure of which that individual's own \"subjectiv\u00ad ity\" and function are themselves a product. (4) Like the authors who produce literary texts, their readers are \"subjects\" who are constructed and positioned by the conditions and ideological 1 86 NEW HISTORICISM formations of their own era. All claims, therefore, for the possibility of a disinterested and objective interpretation and evaluation of a literary text\u2014such as Matthew Arnold's behest that we see a work \"as in itself it really is\"\u2014are among the illusions of a humanistic idealism. Insofar as the ideology of readers conforms to the ideology of the writer of a liter\u00ad ary text, the readers will tend to naturalize the text\u2014that is, interpret its culture-specific and time-bound representations as though they were the features of universal and permanent human experience. On the other hand, insofar as the readers' ideology differs from that of the writer, they will tend to appropriate the text\u2014that is, interpret it so as to make it conform to their own cultural prepossessions. New historicists acknowledge that they themselves, like all au\u00ad thors, are \"subjectivities\" that have been shaped and informed by the circumstances and discourses specific to their era, hence that their own critical writings in great part construct, rather than discover ready-made, the textual meanings they describe and the literary and cultural histories they narrate. To mitigate the risk that they will un- questioningly appropriate texts that were written in the past, they stress that the course of history between the past and present is not coherent, but exhibits discontinuities, breaks, and ruptures; by doing so, they hope to \"distance\" and \"estrange\" an earlier text and so sharpen their ability to detect its differences from their present ideo\u00ad logical assumptions. Some historicists present their readings of texts written in the past as (in their favored metaphor) \"negotiations\" be\u00ad tween past and present. In this two-way relationship, the features of a cultural product, which are identifiable only relative to their differ\u00ad ences from the historicist's subject-position, in return make possible some degree of insight into the forces and configurations of power\u2014 especially with respect to class, gender, race, and ethnicity\u2014that pre\u00ad vail in the historicist's present culture and serve to shape the historicist's own ideology. The concepts, themes, and procedures of new historicist criticism took shape in the late 1970s and early 1980s, most prominently in writings by scholars of the English Renaissance. They directed their attention especially to literary forms such as the pastoral and masque, and above all drama; emphasized the role in shaping a text of social and economic conditions such as literary patronage, censorship, and the control of access to printing; analyzed texts as discursive \"sites\" which enacted and reproduced the interests and power of the Tudor monarchy; but were alert to detect within such texts the voices of the oppressed, the marginalized, and the dispossessed. At almost the same time, students of the English Romantic period developed paral\u00ad lel conceptions of the intertextuality of literature and history, and similar views that the \"representations\" in literary texts are not re\u00ad flectors of reality but \"concretized\" forms of ideology. Historicists of Romantic literature, however, in distinction from most Renaissance NEW HISTORICISM historicists, often name their critical procedures political readings of a literary text\u2014readings in which they stress quasi-Freudian mecha\u00ad nisms such as \"suppression/' \"displacement,\" and \"substitution\" by which, they assert, a writer's political ideology (in a process of which the writer remains largely or entirely unaware) inevitably disguises, or entirely elides into silence and \"absence,\" the circumstances and con\u00ad tradictions of contemporary history. The primary aim of a political reader of a literary text is to undo these ideological disguises and sup\u00ad pressions in order to uncover the historical and political conflicts and oppressions which are the text's true, although covert or unmen- tioned, subject matter. (See Pierre Macherey, under Marxist criticism.) In the course of the 1980s, the characteristic viewpoints and practices of new historicism spread rapidly to all periods of literary study, and were increasingly represented, described, and debated in conferences, books, and periodical essays. The interpretative proce\u00ad dures of this critical mode have interacted with the earlier concern of feminist critics, who stressed the role of male power-structures in forming dominant ideological and cultural constructs. New histori- cist procedures also have parallels in the critics of African American and other ethnic literatures, who stress the role of culture-formations dominated by White Europeans in suppressing, marginalizing, or dis\u00ad torting the achievements of non-White and non-European peoples. In the 1990s, it seems clear, various forms of new historicism, and re\u00ad lated types of criticism that stress the embeddedness of literature in historical circumstances, have displaced deconstruction as the reign\u00ad ing mode of avant-garde critical theory and practice. Stephen Greenblatt inaugurated the currency of the label \"new historicism\" in his Introduction to a special issue of Genre, Vol. 15 (1982). He prefers, however, to call his own critical enterprise cul\u00ad tural poetics, in order to highlight his concern with literature and the arts as integral with other social practices that, in their complex interactions, make up the general culture of an era. Greenblatt's essay entitled \"Invisible Bullets\" in Shakespearean Negotiations (1988) serves to exemplify the interpretive procedures of a leading exponent of this mode of criticism. Greenblatt begins by reading a selection from Thomas Harriot's A Brief and True Report of the New Found Land of Vir\u00ad ginia, written in 1588, as a representative discourse of the English col\u00ad onizers of America which, without its author's awareness, serves to confirm \"the Machiavellian hypothesis of the origin of princely power in force and fraud,\" but nonetheless draws its \"audience irre\u00ad sistibly toward the celebration of that power.\" Greenblatt also asserts that Harriot tests the English power structure that he attests by recording in his Report the counter-voices of the American Indians who are being appropriated and oppressed by that power. Greenblatt then identifies parallel modes of power-discourse and counterdis- course in the dialogues in Shakespeare's Tempest between Prospero NEW HISTORICISM the imperialist appropriator and Caliban the expropriated native of his island, and goes on to find similar discursive configurations in the texts of Shakespeare's Henry IV, 1 and 2 and Henry V. In Greenblatt's reading, the dialogue and events of the Henry plays reveal the degree to which princely power is based on pr\u00e9dation, calculation, deceit, and hypocrisy; at the same time, the plays do not scruple to record the dissonant and subversive voices of Falstaff and various other represen\u00ad reve\u00ad lations in Shakespeare's plays, however, in fact are so managed as to maneuver their audience to accept and even glorify the power- structure to which that audience is itself subordinated. Greenblatt ap\u00ad plies to these plays a conceptual pattern, the subversion-containment dialectic, which has been a central concern of new historicist critics of Renaissance literature. His thesis is that, in order to sustain its power, any durable political and cultural order not only to some degree allows, but actively fosters \"subversive\" elements and forces, yet in such a way as more effectively to \"contain\" such challenges to the existing order. This view of the general triumph of containment over the forces of subversion has been criticized as \"pessimistic\" and \"quietist\" by the groups of new historicists, known as \"cultural materi\u00ad alists,\" who insist on the capacity of subversive ideas and practices\u2014 including those manifested in their own critical writings\u2014to effect drastic social changes. Cultural materialism is a term, used by the British neo-Marxist critic Raymond Williams, which has been adopted by a number of other British scholars, especially those concerned with the literature of the Renaissance, to indicate the Marxist orientation of their mode of new historicism\u2014Marxist in that they retain a version of Marx's view of cultural phenomena as a \"superstructure\" which in the last analysis is determined by the economic \"base.\" (See Marxist criticism.) They insist that, whatever the \"textuality\" of history, a culture and its literary products are always to an important degree conditioned by the real material forces and relations of production in their historical era. They are particularly interested in the political significance, and especially the subversive aspects and effects, of a literary text, not only in its own time, but also in later versions that have been revised for the theater and the cinema, and in the changing interpretations of the text by later literary critics. Cultural materialists stress that their criticism is itself oriented toward political \"intervention\" in their own era, in an express \"commitment,\" as Jonathan Dollimore and Alan Sinfield have put it, \"to the transformation of a social order which exploits people on grounds of race, gender, and class.\" (Fore\u00ad word to Political Shakespeare: New Essays in Cultural Materialism, 1985.) Similar views are expressed by those American exponents of the new literary history who are political activists; indeed, some of them claim that if new historicists limit themselves to describing the examples of NEW HISTORICISM 89 class dominance and exploitation in literary texts, but stop short of a commitment to remake the present social order, they have been co- opted into \"complicity\" with the formalism of the types of literary criticism that they set out to displace. See cultural studies, which are closely related in concepts and prac\u00ad tices to the new historicism. For writers especially influential in form\u00ad ing the concepts and practice of the new historicism, see Louis Althusser, Lenin and Philosophy, and Other Essays (1969, trans. 1971); Louis McKay, Foucault: A Critical Introduction (1994); and Clifford \"Thick Description: Toward an Interpretive Theory of Cul\u00ad ture,\" in The Interpretation of Cultures (1973). The New Historicism, ed. H. Aram Veeser (1989), is a useful collection of essays by Louis Mon\u00ad trose, Stephen Greenblatt, and other prominent historicists who focus on the Renaissance; see also the essays in Jeffrey N. Cox and Larry J. Reynolds, New Historical Literary Study (1993); Stephen Greenblatt, ed.

For a feminist application of new historicism, refer to Margaret W. Ferguson, Maureen Quilligan, and Nancy J. Vickers, eds.

Walter Cohen, \"Political Criticism of Shakespeare,\" in Jean E. Howard and Marion F. O'Connor, eds., Shakespeare Reproduced: The Text in History and Ideology (1987), interrogates new historicism from a Marxist point of view; while J. Hillis Miller, in his presidential address to the Mod\u00ad ern Language Association on \"The Triumph of Theory\" (PMLA, Vol. 102, 1987, pp. 281-91), does so from the point of view of deconstruc- tive criticism. Feminist critiques of new historicism are Lynda Boose, \"The Family in Shakespeare Studies,\" Renaissance Quarterly 40 (1987); and Carol Thomas Neely, \"Constructing the Subject: Feminist Prac\u00ad tice and the New Renaissance Discourse\" (English Literary Renaissance, Vol. 18, 1988). Critiques of new historicism from more traditional critical positions are Edward Pechter, \"The New Historicism and Its Discontents,\" Political of Lyrical Ballads/' in Doing Things with Texts: Essays in Criticism 190 NOVEL and Critical Theory (1989); Richard Levin, \"Unthinkable Thoughts in the New Historicizing of English Renaissance Drama,\" New Literary History 21 (1989-90), pp. 433-47; and Brook Thomas, The New His- toricism and Other Old-Fashioned Topics (1991).

Novel. The term \"novel\" is now applied to a great variety of writings that have in common only the attribute of being extended works of fiction written in prose. As an extended narrative, the novel is distinguished from the short story and from the work of middle length called the novelette; its magnitude permits a greater variety of characters, greater complication of plot (or plots), ampler development of milieu, and more sustained exploration of character and motives than do the shorter, more concentrated modes. As a narrative written in prose, the novel is distinguished from the long narratives in verse of Geoffrey Chaucer, Edmund Spenser, and John Milton which, beginning with the eighteenth century, the novel has increasingly supplanted. Within these limits the novel includes such diverse works as Samuel Richardson's Pamela and Laurence Sterne's The Wings of the Dove; Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace and Franz Kafka's The Trial; Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises and James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Doris Lessing's The Golden Notebook and Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita. The term for the novel in most European languages is roman, which is derived from the medieval term, the romance. The English name for the form, on the other hand, is derived from the Italian novella (literally, \"a little new thing\"), which was a short tale in prose. In fourteenth-century Italy there was a vogue for collections of such tales, some serious and some scandalous; the best known of these collections is Boccaccio's Decameron, which is still avail\u00ad able in English translation at any well-stocked bookstore. Currently the term \"novella\" (or in the German form, Novelle) is often used as an equivalent for novelette: a prose fiction of middle length, such as Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness or Thomas Mann's Death in Venice. (See under short story.) Long narrative romances in prose were written by Greek writers as early as the second and third centuries A.D. Typically they dealt with separated lovers who, after perilous adventures and hairbreadth escapes, are happily re\u00ad united at the end. The best known of these Greek romances, influential in later European literature, were the Aethiopica by Heliodorus and the charming pastoral narrative Daphnis and Chloe by Longus. Thomas Lodge's Rosalynde (the model for Shakespeare's As You Like It) and Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia were Elizabethan continuations of the pastoral romance of the ancient Greeks. (See romance and pastoral.) Another important predecessor of the later novel was the picaresque nar\u00ad rative, which emerged in sixteenth-century Spain, although the most popular instance, Gil Bias (1715), was written by the Frenchman Le Sage. \"Picaro\" is NOVEL 191 Spanish for \"rogue/' and a typical story concerns the escapades of an insou\u00ad ciant rascal who lives by his wits and shows little if any alteration of character through the long succession of his adventures. Picaresque fiction is realistic in manner, episodic in structure (that is, composed of a sequence of events held together largely because they happened to one person), and often satiric in aim. The first, and very lively, English example was Thomas Nashe's The Un\u00ad fortunate Traveller (1594). We recognize the survival of the picaresque type in many later novels such as Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876), Thomas Mann's Felix Krull (1954), and Saul Bellow's The Adventures ofAugie March (1953). The development of the novel owes much to prose works which, like the picaresque story, were written to deflate romantic or idealized fictional forms. Cervantes' great quasi-picaresque narrative Don Quixote (1605) was the single most important progenitor of the modern novel; in it, an engaging madman who tries to live by the ideals of chivalric romance in the everyday world is used to explore the relations of illusion and reality in human life. After these precedents and many others\u2014including the seventeenth- century character (a brief sketch of a typical personality or way of life) and Madame de La Fayette's psychologically complex study of character, La Princesse de Cleves (1678)\u2014what is recognizably the novel as we now think of it appeared in England in the early eighteenth century. In 1719 Daniel Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe and in 1722, Moll Flanders. Both of these are still pica\u00ad resque in type, in the sense that their structure is episodic rather than in the organized form of a plot; while Moll is herself a colorful female version of the old picaro\u2014\"twelve Year a Whore, five times a Wife (whereof once to her own Brother), Twelve Year a Thief, Eight Year a Transported Felon in Virginia,\" as the title page resoundingly informs us. But Robinson Crusoe is given an en\u00ad forced unity of action by its focus on the problem of surviving on an unin\u00ad habited island, and both stories present so convincing a central character, set in so solid and detailedly realized a world, that Defoe is often credited with writing the first novel of incident. The credit for having written the first English novel of character, or \"psychological novel,\" is almost unanimously given to Samuel Richardson for his Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded (1740). Pamela is the story of a sentimental but shrewd young woman who, by prudently safeguarding her beleaguered chastity, succeeds in becoming the wife of a wild young gentleman instead of his debauched servant girl. The distinction between the novel of incident and the novel of character cannot be drawn sharply; but in the novel of incident the greater interest is in what the protagonist will do next and on how the story will turn out; in the novel of character, it is on the protagonist's motives for what he or she does, and on how the protagonist as a person will turn out. On twentieth-century developments in the novel of character see Leon Edel, The Modem Psychological Novel (rev., 1965). Pamela, like its greater and tragic successor, Richardson's Clarissa (1747-48), is an epistolary novel; that is, the narrative is conveyed entirely by an exchange of letters. Later novelists have preferred alternative devices for 192 NOVEL limiting the narrative point of view to one or another single character, but the epistolary technique is still occasionally revived\u2014for example, in Mark Harris' hilarious novel Wake Up, Stupid (1959) and Alice Walker's The Color Purple (1982). See Linda Kauffman, Special Delivery: Epistolary Modes in Modern Fiction (1992). Novels may have any kind of plot form\u2014tragic, comic, satiric, or roman\u00ad tic. A common distinction\u2014which was described by Hawthorne, in his preface to The House of the Seven Gables (1851) and elsewhere, and has been adopted and expanded by a number of recent critics\u2014is that between two basic types of prose fiction: the realistic novel (which is the novel proper) and the romance. The realistic novel is characterized as the fictional attempt to give the effect of realism, by representing complex characters with mixed motives who are rooted in a social class, operate in a developed social structure, interact with many other characters, and undergo plausible, everyday modes of experience. This novelistic mode, rooted in such eighteenth-century writers as Defoe and Fielding, achieved a high development in the master-novelists of the nineteenth century, including Jane Austen, George Eliot, Anthony Trollope, William Dean Howells, and Henry James in England and America; Stendhal, George Sand, Balzac, and Flaubert in France; and Turgenev and Tolstoy in Rus\u00ad sia. If, as in the writings of Jane Austen, Edith Wharton, and John P. Mar- quand, a realistic novel focuses on the customs, conversation, and ways of thinking and valuing of a particular social class, it is often called a novel of manners. The prose romance, on the other hand, has as precursors the chival- ric romance of the Middle Ages and the Gothic novel of the later eighteenth cen\u00ad tury. It usually deploys characters who are sharply discriminated as heroes or villains, masters or victims; its protagonist is often solitary, and relatively iso\u00ad lated from a social context; it tends to be set in the historical past, and the at\u00ad mosphere is such as to suspend the reader's expectations based on everyday experience. The plot of the prose romance emphasizes adventure, and is fre\u00ad quently cast in the form of the quest for an ideal, or the pursuit of an enemy; and the nonrealistic and occasionally melodramatic events are claimed by some critics to project in symbolic form the primal desires, hopes, and terrors in the depths of the human mind, and to be therefore analogous to the mate\u00ad rials of dream, myth, ritual, and folklore. Examples of romance novels are Wal\u00ad ter Scott's Rob Roy Bronte's (1847), and an important line of American narratives which extends from Edgar Allan Poe, James Fenimore Cooper, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Herman Melville to recent writings of William Faulkner and Saul Bellow. Martin Green, in Dreams of Adventure, Deeds of Em\u00ad pire (1979), distinguishes a special type of romance, \"the adventure novel,\" which deals with masculine adventures in the newly colonized non-European world. Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719) is an early prototype; some later in\u00ad stances are H. Rider Haggard's King Solomon's Mines (1886), Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island (1883), and Rudyard Kipling's Kim (1901). Refer to Deborah Ross, The Excellence of Falsehood: Romance, Realism, and Women's Contribution to the Novel (1991). On the realistic novel in the nineteenth NOVEL 193 century see Harry Levin, The Gates of Horn: A Study of Five French Realists (1963); loan Williams, The Realist Novel in England (1975); G. J. Becker, Master European Realists (1982). On the prose romance in America, see Richard Chase, The American Novel and Its Tradition (1957); Northrop Frye, \"The Mythos of Summer: Romance,\" in Anatomy of Criticism (1957); Joel Porte, The Romance in America (1969); Michael D. Bell, The Development of American Romance (1980); and for a skeptical view of the usual division between novel and romance, Nina Baym, Novels, Readers, and Reviewers: Responses to Fiction in Antebellum America (1984). Other often identified subclasses of the novel are based on differences in subject matter, emphasis, and artistic purpose: Bildungsroman and Erziehungsroman are German terms signifying \"novel of formation\" or \"novel of education.\" The subject of these novels is the development of the protagonist's mind and character, in the passage from childhood through varied experiences\u2014and often through a spiritual crisis\u2014 into maturity, which usually involves recognition of one's identity and role in the world. The mode was begun by K. P. Moritz's Anton Reiser (1785-90) and Goethe's Wilhelm Bronte's Jane Eyre (1847), George Eliot's The Mill on the Floss (1860), Charles Dickens' Great Expectations (1861), Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage (1915), and Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain (1924). An important sub\u00ad type of the Bildungsroman is the K\u00fcnstlerroman (\"artist-novel\"), which rep\u00ad resents the growth of a novelist or other artist from childhood into the stage of maturity that signalizes the recognition of the protagonist's artistic destiny and mastery of an artistic craft. Instances of this type include some major twentieth-century novels: Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past (1913-27), James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1914-15), Thomas Mann's Tonio Kroger (1903) and Dr. Faustus (1947), and Andr\u00e9 Gide's The Counterfeiters (1926). See (1930); \"The Princess Casamassima,\" in The Maurice Beebe, Ivory Towers and Saaed Founts: The Artistas Hero in Fiction (1964); Jerome H. Buckley, Season of Youth: The Bildungsroman from Dickens to Golding (1974); Martin Swales, The German Bildungsroman from Wieland to Hesse (1978). In Unbecoming Women: British Women Writers and the Novel of Development (1993), Susan Fraiman analyzes novels about \"grow\u00ad ing up female\"; she proposes that they put to question the \"enabling fiction\" that the Bildungsroman is a \"progressive development\" toward \"masterful self\u00ad hood.\" The social novel emphasizes the influence of the social and economic conditions of an era on shaping characters and determining events; often it also embodies an implicit or explicit thesis recommending political and social reform. Examples of social novels are Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Toms Cabin (1852), Upton Sinclair's The Jungle (1906), John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath (1939), Nadine Gordimer's Burgers Daughter (1979). Some realistic novels make use of events and personages from the histor\u00ad ical past to add interest and picturesqueness to the narrative. What we usually 194 NOVEL specify as the historical novel, however, began in the nineteenth century with Sir Walter Scott. The historical novel not only takes its setting and some characters and events from history, but makes the historical events and issues crucial for the central characters and narrative. Some of the greatest historical novels also use the protagonists and actions to reveal what the author regards as the deep forces that impel the historical process. Examples of historical novels are Scott's Ivanhoe (1819), set in the period of Norman domination of the Saxons at the time of Richard I; Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities (1859), in Paris and London during the French Revolution; George Eliot's Romola (1863), in Florence during the Renaissance; War and Peace (1869), during Napoleon's invasion of Russia; and Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind (1936), in Georgia during the Civil War and Reconstruction. An influential treatment of the form was by the Marxist scholar and critic Georg Luk\u00e1cs, The Historical Novel (1937; trans. 1962); a comprehensive later commentary is Harry E. Shaw, The Forms of Historical Fiction: Sir Walter Scott and His Successors (1983). One twentieth-century variant of the historical novel is known as docu\u00ad mentary fiction, which incorporates not only historical characters and events, but also reports of everyday events in contemporary newspapers: John Dos Passos, USA (1938); E. L. Doctorow, Ragtime (1975) and Billy Bathgate (1989). Another recent offshoot is the form that one of its innovators, Truman Capote, named the nonfiction novel. This uses a variety of novelistic tech\u00ad niques, such as deviations from the temporal sequence of events and descrip\u00ad tions of a participant's state of mind, to give a graphic rendering of recent people and happenings, and is based not only on historical records but often on personal interviews with the chief agents. Truman Capote's In Cold Blood (1965) and Norman Mailer's The Executioner's Song (1979) are instances of this mode; both offer a detailed rendering of the life, personality, and actions of murderers, based on a sustained series of prison interviews with the protago\u00ad nists themselves. Other examples of this form are the writings of John McPhee, which the author calls literature of fact; see his Levels of the Game (1969) and The Deltoid Pumpkin Seed (1973). A third variant is the fabulative historical novel that interweaves history with fantasized, even fantastic events: John Barth, The Sot-Weed Factor (1960, rev. 1967); Thomas Pynchon, Gravity's Rain\u00ad bow (1973). See John Hollowell, Fact and Fiction: The New Journalism and the Non\u00dfction Novel (1977); Barbara Foley, Telling the Truth: The Theory and Practice of Documentary Fiction (1986); and Barbara Lounsberry, The Art of Fact: Nonftction (1990). Cushing Strout, in The Veracious Imagination (1981), studies other recent developments in novels, as well as the related form called documentary drama in theater, film, and television, which combines fiction with history, journalistic reports, and biography. The regional novel emphasizes the setting, speech, and social structure and customs of a particular locality, not merely as local color, but as impor\u00ad tant conditions affecting the temperament of the characters and their ways of thinking, feeling, and interacting. Instances of such localities are \"Wes- sex\" in Thomas Hardy's novels, and \"Yoknapatawpha County,\" Mississippi, NOVEL 195 in Faulkner's. Stella Gibbons wrote a witty parody of the regional novel in Cold Comfort Farm (1936). Beginning with the second half of the nineteenth century, the novel dis\u00ad placed all other literary forms in popularity. The novelistic art has received the devoted attention of some of the greatest masters of modern literature\u2014 Flaubert, Henry James, Proust, Mann, Joyce, and Virginia Woolf. (Henry James' prefaces, gathered into one volume as The Art of the Novel, ed. R. P. Blackmur, 1934, exemplify the care and subtlety that have been lavished on this craft.) There has been constant experimentation with new fictional meth\u00ad ods, such as management of the point of view to minimize or eliminate the ap\u00ad parent role of the author-narrator or, at the opposite extreme, to foreground the role of the author as the inventor and controller of the fiction; the use of symbolist and expressionist techniques and of devices adopted from the art of the cinema; the dislocation of time sequence; the adaptation of forms and motifs from myths and dreams; and the exploitation of stream of consciousness narration in a way that converts the story of outer action and events into a drama of the life of the mind. In recent decades such experimentation has reached a radical extreme (see postmodernism). Vladimir Nabokov is a supreme technician who writes involuted novels (a work whose subject incorporates an account of its own genesis and development\u2014for example, his Pale Fire), employs multilingual puns and jokes, incorporates esoteric data about butterflies (a subject in which he was an accomplished scientist) and strategies from chess, crossword puzzles, and other games, parodies other novels (and his own as well), and sets elaborate traps for the unwary reader. This is also the era of what is some\u00ad times called the antinovel\u2014that is, a work which is deliberately constructed in a negative fashion, relying for its effects on the deletion of standard ele\u00ad ments, on violating traditional norms, and on playing against the expecta\u00ad tions established in the reader by the novelistic methods and conventions of the past. Thus Alain Robbe-Grillet, a leader among the exponents of the nou\u00ad veau roman (the new novel) in France has written Jealousy (1957), in which he leaves out such standard elements as plot, characterization, descriptions of states of mind, normal settings in time and space, and frame of reference to the world in which the work is set. We are simply presented in this novel with a sequence of perceptions, mainly visual, which we may naturalize (that is, make intelligible on the model of standard narrative procedures) by postulat\u00ad ing that we are occupying the physical space and sharing the hyperacute ob\u00ad servations of a jealous husband, from which we may infer also the tortured state of his disintegrating mind. Other new novelists are Nathalie Sarraute and Philippe Sollers. See Roland Barthes, Writing Degree Zero (trans., 1967), and Stephen Heath, The Nouveau Roman: A Study in the Practice of Writing (1972). The term magic realism, originally applied in the 1920s to a school of painters, is used to describe the prose fiction of Jorge Luis Borges in Argentina, as well as the work of writers such as Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez in Colombia, Is\u00ad abel Allende in Chile, G\u00fcnter Grass in Germany, Italo Calvino in Italy, and 96 OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE John Fowles in England. These writers interweave, in an ever-shifting pattern, a sharply etched realism in representing ordinary events and descriptive details together with fantastic and dreamlike elements, as well as with materials de\u00ad rived from myth and fairy tales. Robert Scholes has popularized metaf\u00ecction (an alternative is surfiction) as an overall term for the growing class of novels which depart from realism and foreground the role of the author and reader in inventing and receiving the fiction. Scholes has also popularized the term fab\u00ad ulation for a current mode of free-wheeling narrative invention. Fabulative novels violate, in various ways, standard novelistic expectations by drastic\u2014 and sometimes highly effective\u2014experiments with subject matter, form, style, temporal sequence, and fusions of the everyday, the fantastic, the mythical, and the nightmarish, in renderings that blur traditional distinctions between what is serious or trivial, horrible or ludicrous, tragic or comic. Recent fabula- tors include Thomas Pynchon, John Barth, Donald Barthelme, William Gass, Robert Coover, and Ishmael Reed. See Surfiction (1975), Robert James M. Mellard, The Exploded Form: The Modernist Novel in America (1980); and Patricia Waugh, Metaf\u00ecction (1984).

Objective and Subjective. The social critic John Ruskin complained in 1856 that \"German dullness and English affectation have of late much multi\u00ad plied among us the use of two of the most objectionable words that were ever coined by the troublesomeness of metaphysicians\u2014namely, Objective' and 'subjective.'\" Ruskin was at least in part right. The words were imported into English criticism from the post-Kantian German critics of the late-eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and they have certainly been troublesome. Amid the great variety of sometimes conflicting ways in which the opposition has been applied to literature, one is sufficiently widespread to be worth spec\u00ad ifying. A subjective work is one in which the author incorporates personal OBJECTIVE CORRELATIVE \u00b7 OCCASIONAL POEMS 197 experiences, or projects into the narrative his or her personal disposition, judg\u00ad ments, values, and feelings. An objective work is one in which the author pres\u00ad ents the invented situation or the fictional characters and their thoughts, feelings, and actions and undertakes to remain detached and noncommittal. Thus a subjective lyric is one in which we are invited to associate the \"I,\" or lyric speaker, with the Plath's \"Daddy\"); in an objective lyric the speaker is obviously an invented character (Robert Browning's \"My Last Duchess,\" T. S. Eliot's Alfred Prufrock,\" Wallace Stevens' \"Sunday Morning\"). A subjective novel is one in which the author (or at any rate the narrator) intervenes to comment and deliver judg\u00ad ments about the characters and actions represented; an objective novel is one in which the author is self-effacing and tries to create the effect that the story tells itself. Critics agree, however, that the difference between a subjective and objective literary work is not absolute, but a matter of degree. See confessional poetry, distance and involvement, negative capability, persona, and point of view. On the introduction of the terms \"objective\" and \"subjective\" into Eng\u00ad lish criticism and the variousness of their application, see M. H. Abrams, The Minor and the Lamp (1953), pp. 235-44. For their application to modern criti\u00ad cism of the novel, see Wayne C. Booth, The Rhetoric of Fiction (1961), chapter 3. Objective Correlative. This term, which had been coined by the American painter and poet Washington Allston (1779-1843), was introduced by T. S. Eliot, rather casually, into his essay \"Hamlet and His Problems\" (1919); its subsequent vogue in literary criticism, Eliot said, astonished him. \"The only way of expressing emotion,\" Eliot wrote, \"is by finding an Objective correla\u00ad tive'; in other words, a set of objects, a situation, a chain of events which shall be the formula of that particular emotion,\" and which will evoke the same emotion from the reader. Eliot's formulation has been often criticized for fal\u00ad sifying the way a poet actually composes, since no object or situation is in it\u00ad self a \"formula\" for an emotion, but depends for its emotional significance and effect on the way it is rendered and used by a particular poet. The vogue of Eliot's concept of an outer correlative for inner feelings was due in part to its accord with the reaction of the New Criticism against vagueness of de\u00ad scription and the direct statement of poetry\u2014an oft-cited example was Shelley's \"Indian Serenade\": \"I Correlative of T. S. Eliot,\" reprinted in Critiques and Essays in Criticism, ed. Robert W. Stallman (1949). Occasional Poems are written to celebrate or memorialize a specific occa\u00ad sion, such as a birthday, a marriage, a death, a military engagement or vic\u00ad tory, the dedication of a public building, or the opening performance of a play. Edmund Spenser's \"Epithalamion,\" on the occasion of his own mar\u00ad riage, John Milton's \"Lycidas,\" on the death of the young poet Edward King, Andrew Marvell's \"An Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland,\" 198 ODE and Alfred, Lord Tennyson's \"The Charge of the Light Brigade\" are all poems that have long survived their original occasions, and W. B. Yeats' \"Easter, 1916\" and W. H. Auden's \"September 1, 1939\" are notable modern examples. England's poet laureate is often called on to meet the emergency of royal anniversaries and important public events with an appropriate occasional poem. Ode. A long lyric poem that is serious in subject and treatment, elevated in style, and elaborate in its stanzaic structure. As Norman Maclean has said, the term now calls to mind a lyric which is \"massive, public in its proclamations, and Pindaric in its classical prototype\" (\"From Action to Image,\" in Critics and Criticism, ed. R. S. Crane, 1952). The prototype was established by the Greek poet Pindar, whose odes were modeled on the songs by the chorus in Greek drama. His complex stanzas were patterned in sets of three: moving in a dance rhythm to the left, the chorus chanted the strophe; moving to the right, the antistrophe; then, standing still, the epode. The regular or Pindaric ode in English is a close imitation of Pindar's form, with all the strophes and antistrophes written in one stanza pattern, and all the epodes in another. This form was introduced into England by Ben Jonson's ode \"To the Immortal Memory and Friendship of That Noble Pair, Sir Lucius Cary and Sir H. Morison\" (1629); the typical construction can be con\u00ad veniently studied in this poem or in Thomas Gray's \"The Progress of Poesy\" (1757). The irregular ode was introduced in 1656 by Abraham Cowley, who imitated the Pindaric style and matter but disregarded the recurrent stanzaic pattern in each strophic triad; instead, he allowed each stanza to establish its own pattern of variable line lengths, number of lines, and rhyme scheme. This type of irregular stanzaic structure, which is free to alter in accordance with shifts in subject and mood, has been the most common for the English ode ever since; Wordsworth's were encomiastic; that is, they were written to praise and glorify someone\u2014in the instance of Pindar, the ode celebrated a victorious athlete in the Olympic games. The earlier English odes, and many later ones, were also written to eulogize something, such as a person (John Dryden's \"Anne Killigrew\"), or the arts of music or poetry (Dryden's \"Alexander's Feast\"), or a time of day (Collins' abstract and Wordsworth's \"Ode to Duty\"). Romantic poets perfected the personal ode of description and passionate meditation, which is stimulated by (and sometimes at its close reverts to) an aspect of the outer scene and turns on the attempt to solve either a personal emotional problem or a generally human one (Wordsworth's \"Intimations\" ode, Cole\u00ad ples of this latter type are Allen \"Ode to the Confederate Dead\" and Wallace Stevens' \"The Idea of Order at Key West.\" See M. H. Abrams, \"Struc\u00ad ture and Style in the Greater Romantic Lyric,\" in The Conespondent Breeze, 1984. ONOMATOPOEIA 199 The Horatian ode was originally modeled on the matter, tone, and form of the odes of the Roman Horace. In contrast to the passion, visionary bold\u00ad ness, and formal language of Pindar's odes, many Horatian odes are calm, meditative, and colloquial; they are also usually homostrophic (that is, writ\u00ad ten in a single repeated stanza form), and shorter than the Pindaric ode. Ex\u00ad amples are Keats' ode \"To Autumn\" (1820). See Robert Shafer, The English Ode to 1660 (1918); G. N. Shuster, The Eng\u00ad lish Ode from Milton to Keats (1940, reprinted 1964); Carol Maddison, Apollo and the Nine: A History of the Ode (I960)\u2014this book includes a discussion of the odes of Pindar and Horace (chapter 2); John Heath-Stubbes, The Ode (1969); Paul H. Fry, The Poet's Calling in the English Ode (1980). Onomatopoeia, sometimes called echoism, is used both in a narrow and in a broad sense. (1) In the narrow and most common use, onomatopoeia designates a word, or a combination of words, whose sound seems to resemble closely the sound it denotes: \"hiss,\" \"buzz,\" \"rattle,\" \"bang.\" There is no exact duplication, however, of nonverbal by verbal sounds; the perceived similarity is due as much to the meaning, and to the feel of articulating the words, as to their sounds. Two lines of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's \"Come Down, O Maid\" (1847) are often cited as a skillful instance of onomatopoeia: The moan of doves in immemorial elms, And murmuring of innumerable bees. The American critic John Crowe Ransom has remarked that by mak\u00ad ing only two changes in the consonants of the last line, we lose the echoic effect because we change the meaning drastically: \"And mur\u00ad dering of innumerable beeves.\" The sounds seemingly mimicked by onomatopoeic words need not be pleasant ones. Robert Browning liked squishy and scratchy ef\u00ad fects, as in \"Meeting at Night\" (1845): As I gain the cove with pushing prow, And quench its speed i' the slushy sand. A tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch And blue spurt of a lighted match.... Compare euphony and cacophony. (2) In the broad sense, \"onomatopoeia\" is applied to words or passages which seem to correspond to, or to strongly suggest, what they de\u00ad note in any way whatever\u2014in size, movement, tactile feel, or force, as well as sound (see sound-symbolism). Alexander Pope recommends such extended verbal mimicry in his Essay on Criticism (1711) when he says that \"the sound should seem an echo of the sense,\" and goes on to illustrate his maxim by mimicking two different kinds of action 200 ORAL FORMULAIC POETRY \u00b7 PALINODE or motion by the metrical movement and by the difficulty or ease of utterance, in conjunction with the meanings, of the poetic lines that describe them: When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw, The line too labors, and the words move slow; Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain, Flies o'er th' unbending corn, and skims along the main. Oral Formulaic Poetry. Poetry that is composed and transmitted by singers or reciters. Its origins are prehistoric, yet it continues to flourish even now among populations which for the most part cannot read or write. Oral poetry includes both narrative forms (see epic and ballad) and lyric forms (see folk songs). There is no fixed version of an oral composition, since each per\u00ad former tends to render it differently, and sometimes introduces differences between one performance and the next. Such poems, however, typically in\u00ad corporate verbal formulas\u2014set words, word patterns, and refrains\u2014which help a performer to improvise a narrative or song on a given theme, and also to recall and repeat, although often with variations, a poem that has been learned from someone else. Some oral ballads and songs have been collected and published ever since the eighteenth century. The systematic analysis of oral formulaic poetry in its origins and early renderings, however, was begun in the 1930s by the Ameri\u00ad can scholar Milman Parry on field trips to Yugoslavia, the last place in Europe where the custom of composing and transmitting oral poetry, especially heroic narratives of warfare, still survived. Albert B. Lord and other successors continued Parry's work, and also applied the principles of this contemporary oral poetry retrospectively to an analysis of the constitution of the Homeric epics, the Anglo-Saxon Beowulf, the Old French Chanson de Roland, and other epic poems which, although they survive only in a written form, had origi\u00ad nated and evolved as oral formulaic poetry. Research in oral literary perform\u00ad ances is also being carried on in Africa, Asia, and other parts of the world where the ancient tradition maintains its vitality. Walter J. Ong, Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word (1982) analyzes the effects on literary compositions of the shift from an oral to a print culture. A description of Milman Parry's work is in Serbocroatian Heroic Songs, ed. Albert B. Lord, Vol. 1; see also Albert B. Lord, The Singer of Tales (1960, reprinted 1968); Adam Parry, ed., The Making of Homeric Verse: The Papers of Milman Poetry: Its Nature, Signifi\u00ad cance and Social Context (1977); and J. M. Foley, Oral Traditional Literature (1980, reprinted 1983). Palinode. A poem or poetic passage in which the poet renounces or retracts an earlier poem or type of subject matter. An elaborate and charming example is the Prologue to The Legend of Good Women in which Geoffrey Chaucer, con\u00ad trite after being charged by the God of Love with having slandered women lovers in Troilus and Criseyde and his translation of the Romance of the Rose, PANTOMIME AND DUMB SHOW \u00b7 PARADOX does penance by writing this poem on women who were saints in their fi\u00ad delity to the creed of love. (Refer to courtly love.) Palinodes are especially com\u00ad mon in love poetry. The Elizabethan sonnet by Sir Philip Sidney, \"Leave me, O love which reachest but to dust,\" is a palinode renouncing the poetry of sexual love for that of heavenly love. Pantomime and Dumb Show. Pantomime is acting on the stage without speech, using only posture, gesture, bodily movement, and exaggerated facial expression to mime (\"mimic\") a character's actions and to express a charac\u00ad ter's feelings. Elaborate pantomimes, halfway between drama and dance, were put on in ancient Greece and Rome, and the form was revived, often for comic purposes, in Renaissance Europe. Mimed dramas enjoyed a vogue in eighteenth-century England, and in the present century the silent movies en\u00ad couraged a brief revival of the art and produced a superlative pantomimist in Charlie Chaplin. Miming survived into the present with French masters such as Marcel Marceau in the theater and Jacques Tati in the cinema. England still retains the institution of the Christmas pantomime, which enacts children's nursery rhymes, or familiar children's stories such as \"Puss in Boots,\" in a blend of miming, music, and dialogue. In America and many other countries, circus clowns are expert pantomimists, and miming has recently been revived in the theater for the deaf. A dumb show is an episode of pantomime introduced into a spoken play. It was a common device in Elizabethan drama, in imitation of its use by Seneca, the Roman writer of tragedies. Two well-known dumb shows are the preliminary episode, summarizing the action to come, of the play-within-a- play in Hamlet (III. ii.), and the miming of the banishment of the Duchess and her family in John Webster's The Duchess ofMalft (III. iv.). See R. J. Broadbent, A History of Pantomime (1901). Paradox. A paradox is a statement which seems on its face to be logically contradictory or absurd, yet turns out to be interpretable in a way that makes good sense. An instance is the conclusion to John Donne's sonnet \"Death, Be Not Proud\": One short sleep past, we wake eternally And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die. The paradox is used occasionally by almost all poets, but was a persistent and central device in seventeenth-century metaphysical poetry, both in its religious and secular forms. Donne, who wrote a prose collection titled Problems and Paradoxes, exploited the figure in his poetry. \"The Canonization,\" for exam\u00ad ple, is organized as an extended proof, full of local paradoxes, of the paradox\u00ad ical thesis that sexual lovers are saints. Paradox is also a frequent component in verbal wit. If the paradoxical utterance conjoins two terms that in ordinary usage are contraries, it is called an oxymoron; an example is Alfred, Lord Tennyson's \"O Death in life, the days that are no more.\" The oxymoron was a familiar type 202 PASTORAL of Petrarchan conceit in Elizabethan love poetry, in phrases like \"pleasing pains,\" \"I burn and freeze/' \"loving hate.\" It is also a frequent figure in devo\u00ad tional prose and religious poetry as a way of expressing the Christian myster\u00ad ies, which transcend human sense and logic. So John Milton describes the appearance of God, in Paradise Lost (III, 380): Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear. Paradox was a prominent concern of many New Critics, who extended the term from its limited application to a type of figurative language so as to make it encompass all surprising deviations from, or qualifications of, common per\u00ad ceptions or commonplace opinions. It is in this expanded sense of the term that Cleanth Brooks is able to claim, with some plausibility, that \"the language of poetry is the language of paradox,\" in The Well Wrought Urn (1947). See also the recent theory of deconstruction for the claim that all uses of language dis\u00ad seminate themselves into the unresolvable paradox called an aporia. Pastoral. The originator of the pastoral was the Greek poet Theocritus, who in the third century B.C. wrote poems representing the life of Sicilian shep\u00ad herds. (\"Pastor\" is Latin for \"shepherd.\") Virgil later imitated Theocritus in his Latin Eclogues, and in doing so established the enduring model for the tradi\u00ad tional pastoral: a deliberately conventional poem expressing an urban poet's nostalgic image of the peace and simplicity of the life of shepherds and other rural folk in an idealized natural setting. The conventions that hundreds of later poets imitated from Virgil's imitations of Theocritus include a shepherd reclining under a spreading beech tree and meditating the rural muse, or pip\u00ad ing as though he would ne'er grow old, or engaging in a friendly singing con\u00ad test, or expressing his good or bad fortune in a love affair, or grieving over the death of a fellow shepherd. From this last type developed the pastoral elegy, which persisted long after the other traditional types had lost their popularity. Other terms often used synonymously with pastoral are idyll, from the title of Theocritus' pastorals; eclogue gil's pastorals; and bucolic poetry, from the Greek word for \"herdsman.\" Classical poets often described the pastoral life as possessing features of the mythical golden age. Christian pastoralists combined the golden age of pagan fable with the Garden of Eden in the Bible, and also exploited the reli\u00ad gious symbolism of \"shepherd\" (as applied to the ecclesiastical or parish \"pas\u00ad tor,\" and to the figure of Christ as the Good Shepherd) to give many pastoral poems a Christian range of reference. In the Renaissance the traditional pas\u00ad toral was also adapted to diverse satirical and allegorical uses. Edmund Spenser's Shepherd's Calendar (1579), which popularized the mode in English poetry, included most of the varieties of pastoral poems current in that pe\u00ad riod. Such was the attraction of the pastoral dream that Renaissance writers in\u00ad corporated it into various other literary forms. Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia (1581-84) was a long pastoral romance written in an elaborately artful prose. (Arcadia was a mountainous region of Greece which Virgil substituted for PATHETIC FALLACY 203 Theocritus' Sicily as his idealized pastoral milieu.) There was also the pastoral lyric (Christopher Marlowe's \"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love\"), and the pastoral drama. John Fletcher's The Faithful Shepherdess is an example of this last type, and Shakespeare's ^5 You Like It, based on the contemporary pastoral romance Rosalynde by Thomas Lodge, is set in the forest of Arden, a green refuge from the troubles and complications of ordinary life where all enmities are reconciled, all problems resolved, and the course of true love made to run smooth. The last important series of traditional pastorals, and an extreme instance of their calculated and graceful display of high artifice, was Alexander Pope's Pastorals (1709). Five years later John Gay, in his Shepherd's Week, wrote a. par\u00ad ody of the type by applying its elegant formulas to the crudity of actual rustic manners and language, and by doing so, inadvertently showed later poets the way to the seriously realistic treatment of rural life. In 1783 George Crabbe published The Village specifically in order to paint the cot As Truth will paint it and as bards will not. How far the term then lost its traditional application to a poetry of aristocratic artifice is indicated by Wordsworth's title for his realistic rendering of a rural tragedy in 1800: \"Michael, A Pastoral Poem.\" In recent decades the term \"pastoral\" has been expanded in various ways. William Empson, in Some Versions of Pastoral, identified as pastoral any work which opposes simple to complicated life, to the advantage of the former: the simple life may be that of the shepherd, the child, or the working man. In Empson's view this literary mode serves as an oblique way to criticize the values and hierarchical class structure of the society of its time. Empson accordingly applies the term to works ranging from Andrew Marvell's seventeenth-century poem \"The Garden\" to Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonder\u00ad land and the modern proletarian novel. Other critics apply the term \"pas\u00ad toral\" to any work which represents a withdrawal to a place apart that is close to the elemental rhythms of nature, where the protagonist achieves a new perspective on the complexities, frustrations, and conflicts of the social world. W W. Gregg, Pastoral Poetry and Pastoral Drama (1906); the Introduction to English Pastoral Poetry from the Beginnings to Marvell, ed. Frank Kermode (1952); Thomas G. Rosenmeyer, The Green Cabinet: Theocritus and the European Pastoral Lyric (1969); Andrew V. Ettin, Literature and the Pastoral (1985); Paul Alpers, What Is Pastoral? (1996). Pathetic Fallacy. A phrase invented by John Ruskin in 1856 to signify any representation of inanimate natural objects that ascribes to them human ca\u00ad pabilities, sensations, and emotions (Modern Painters, Vol. 3, chapter 12). As used by Ruskin\u2014for whom \"truth\" was a primary criterion of art\u2014the term was derogatory; for, he claimed, such descriptions do not represent the \"true appearances of things to us\" but \"the extraordinary, or false appearances, 204 PATHOS \u00b7 PERIODS OF AMERICAN LITERATURE when we are under the influence of emotion, or contemplative fancy.\" Two of Ruskin's examples are the lines The spendthrift crocus, bursting through the mould Naked and shivering, with his cup of gold, and Coleridge's description in \"Christabel\" of The one red leaf, the last of its clan, That dances as often as dance it can. These passages, Ruskin says, however beautiful, are false and \"morbid.\" Only in the greatest poets is the use of the pathetic fallacy valid, and then only at those rare times when it would be inhuman to resist the pressure of powerful feelings to humanize the perceived fact. Ruskin's contention would make not only his romantic predecessors but just about all poets, including Shakespeare, \"morbid.\" \"Pathetic fallacy\" is now used, for the most part, as a neutral name for a very common phenome\u00ad non in descriptive poetry, in which the ascription of human traits to inani\u00ad mate nature is less formal and more indirect than in the figure called personification. See Josephine Miles, Pathetic Fallacy in the Nineteenth Century (1942); Harold Bloom, ed., The Literary Criticism of John Ruskin (1965), Introduction and pp. 62-78. Pathos in Greek meant the passions, or suffering, or deep feeling generally, as distinguished from ethos, a person's overall disposition or character. In modern criticism, however, pathos is applied in a much more limited way to a scene or passage that is designed to evoke the feelings of tenderness, pity, or sympathetic sorrow from the audience. In the Victorian era a number of prominent writers exploited pathos beyond the endurance of many readers today\u2014examples are the rendering of the death of Little Nell in Charles Dick\u00ad ens' The Old Curiosity Shop and of the death of Little Eva in Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. (See sentimentalismo To many modern readers, the greatest passages do not dwell on the details of suffering but achieve the effect of pathos by understatement and suggestion. Examples are the speech of King Lear when he is briefly reunited with Cordelia (IV. vii. 59 ff.), beginning Pray, do not mock me. I am a very foolish fond old man, and William Wordsworth's terse revelation of the grief of the old father for the loss of his son in Michael (1800), 11. 465-66: Many and many a day he thither went, And never lifted up a single stone. Periods of American Literature. The division of American literature into convenient historical segments, or \"periods,\" lacks the degree of consensus among literary scholars that we find with reference to English literature; see Periods of English Literature. The many syllabi of college surveys reprinted in PERIODS OF AMERICAN LITERATURE 205 Reconstructing American Literature (ed. Paul Lauter, 1983), and the essays in Re\u00ad defining American Literary History, ed. A. LaVonne Brown Ruoff and Jerry W. Ward (1990), demonstrate how variable are the temporal divisions and their names, especially since the recent efforts to do justice to literature written by women and by ethnic minorities. A number of recent historians, anthologists, and teachers of American literature simply divide their survey into dated sec\u00ad tions, without affixing period names. A prominent tendency, however, is to recognize the importance of major wars in marking significant changes in lit\u00ad erature. This tendency, as the scholar Cushing Strout has remarked, \"suggests that there is an order in American political history more visible and com\u00ad pelling than that indicated by specifically literary or intellectual categories.\" The following divisions of American literary history recognize the impor\u00ad tance assigned by many literary historians to the Revolutionary War (1775-81), the Civil War (1861-65), World War I (1914-18), and World War II (1939-45). Under these broad divisions are listed some of the more widely used terms to distinguish periods and subperiods of American literature. These terms, it will be noted, are diverse in kind; they may signify a span of time, or else a form of political organization, or a prominent intellectual or imaginative mode, or a predominant literary form. 1607-1775. This overall era, from the founding of the first settlement at Jamestown to the outbreak of the American Revolution, is often called the Colonial Period. Writings were for the most part religious, practical, or his\u00ad torical. Notable among the seventeenth-century writers of journals and narra\u00ad tives concerning the founding and early history of some of the colonies were William Bradford, John Winthrop, and the theologian Cotton Mather. In the following century Jonathan Edwards was a major philosopher as well as the\u00ad ologian, and Benjamin Franklin an early American master of lucid and cogent prose. Not until 1937, when Edward Taylor's writings were first published from manuscript, was Taylor discovered to have been an able religious poet in the metaphysical style of the English devotional poets Herbert and Crashaw. Anne Bradstreet was the chief Colonial poet of secular and domestic as well as religious subjects. The publication in 1773 of Poems on Various Subjects by Phillis Wheatley, then a nineteen-year-old slave who had been born in Africa, inaugurated the long and distinguished, but until recently neglected, line of Black writers (or by what has come to be the preferred name, African-American writers) in America. The complexity and diversity of the African-American cultural heritage\u2014both Western and African, oral and written, slave and free, Judeo- Christian and pagan, plantation and urban, integrationist and Black national\u00ad ist\u2014have effected tensions and fusions that, over the course of time, have produced a highly innovative and distinctive literature, as well as musical forms that have come to be considered America's unique contribution to the Western musical tradition. See J. Saunders Redding, To Make a Poet Black (1939; reissued 1986); Houston A. Baker, Jr., Black Literature in America (1971); Bernard W Bell, The Afro-American Novel and Its Tradition (1987); Henry L. Gates, Jr., Figures in Black (1987) and ed. Black Literature and Literary Theory 206 PERIODS OF AMERICAN LITERATURE (1984); also Henry L. Gates Jr., Nellie Y. McKay, and others, eds., The Norton Anthology of African-American Literature (1997). The period between the Stamp Act of 1765 and 1790 is sometimes distin\u00ad guished as the Revolutionary Age. It was the time of Thomas Paine's influen\u00ad tial revolutionary tracts; of Thomas Freedom,\" \"Declaration of Independence,\" and many other writ\u00ad ings; of The Federalist Papers in support of the Constitution, most notably those by Alexander Hamilton and James Madison; and of the patriotic and satiric poems by Philip Freneau and Joel Barlow. 1775-1865. The years 1775-1828, the Early National Period ending with the triumph of Jacksonian democracy in 1828, signalized the emergence of a national imaginative literature, including the first American comedy (Royall Tyler's The Contrast, 1787), the earliest American novel (William Hill Brown's The Power of Sympathy, 1789), and the establishment in 1815 of the first enduring American magazine, The North American Review. Washington Irving achieved international fame with his essays and stories; Charles Brock- den Brown wrote distinctively American versions of the Gothic novel of mys\u00ad tery and terror; the career of James Fenimore Cooper, the first major American novelist, was well launched; and William Cullen Bryant and Edgar Allan Poe wrote poetry that was relatively independent of English precursors. In the year 1760 was published the first of a long series of slave narratives and au\u00ad tobiographies written by African-American slaves who had escaped or been freed. Most of these were published between 1830 and 1865, including Fred\u00ad erick Douglass' Nanative of the Life of Frederick Douglass (1845) and Harriet Ja\u00ad cobs' Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861). The span 1828-1865 from the Jacksonian era to the Civil War, often iden\u00ad tified as the Romantic Period in America (see neoclassic and romantic), marks the full coming of age of a distinctively American literature. This period is sometimes known as the American Renaissance, the title of F. O. Matthies- sen's influential book'(1941) about its outstanding writers, Ralph Waldo Emer\u00ad son, Henry David Thoreau, Edgar Allan Poe, Herman Melville, and Nathaniel Hawthorne (see also symbolism); it is also sometimes called the Age of Tran\u00ad scendentalism, after the philosophical and literary movement, centered on Emerson, that was dominant in New England (see Transcendentalism). In all the major literary genres except drama, writers produced works of an originality and excellence not exceeded in later American history. Emerson, Thoreau, and the early feminist Margaret Fuller shaped the ideas, ideals, and literary aims of many contemporary and later American writers. It was the age not only of con\u00ad tinuing writings by William Cullen Bryant, Washington Irving, and James Fen\u00ad imore Cooper, but also of the novels and short stories of Poe, Hawthorne, Melville, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and the southern novelist William Gilmore Simms; of the poetry of Poe, John Greenleaf Whittier, Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and the most innovative and influential of all Ameri\u00ad can poets, Walt Whitman; and of the beginning of distinguished American criticism in the essays of Poe, Simms, and James Russell Lowell. The tradition of African-American poetry by women was continued by Francis Ellen Watkins PERIODS OF AMERICAN LITERATURE Harper, and the African-American novel was inaugurated by William Wells Brown's Clotel (1853) and by Harriet E. Wilson's Our Nig (1859). 1865-1914. The cataclysm of the bloody Civil War and the Reconstruc\u00ad tion, followed by a burgeoning industrialism and urbanization in the North, profoundly altered the American sense of itself, and also American literary modes. 1865-1900 is often known as the Realistic Period, by reference to the novels by Mark Twain, William Dean Howells, and Henry James, as well as by John W DeForest, Harold Frederic, and the African-American novelist Charles W. Chesnutt. These works, though diverse, are often labeled \"realistic\" in con\u00ad trast to the \"romances\" of their predecessors in prose fiction, Poe, Hawthorne, and Melville (see prose romance and realism). Some realistic authors grounded their fiction in a regional milieu; these include (in addition to Mark Twain's novels on the Mississippi River region) Bret Harte in California, Sarah Orne Jewett in Maine, Mary Wilkins Freeman in Massachusetts, and George W. Cable and Kate Chopin in Louisiana. Chopin has become prominent as an early and major feminist novelist. Whitman continued writing poetry up to the last decade of the century, and (unknown to him and almost everyone else) was joined by Emily Dickinson; although only seven of Dickinson's more than a thousand short poems were published in her lifetime, she is now recognized as one of the most distinctive and eminent of American poets. Sid\u00ad ney Lanier published his experiments in versification based on the meters of music; the African-American author Paul Laurence Dunbar published both poems and novels between 1893 and 1905; and in the 1890s Stephen Crane, although he was only twenty-nine when he died, published short poems in free verse that anticipate the experiments of Ezra Pound and the Imagists, and wrote also the brilliantly innovative short stories and short novels that look forward to two later narrative modes, naturalism and impressionism. The years 1900-1914\u2014although James, Howells, and Mark Twain were still writ\u00ad ing, and Edith Wharton was publishing her earlier novels\u2014are discriminated as the Naturalistic Period, in recognition of the powerful though sometimes crudely wrought novels by Frank Norris, Jack London, and Theodore Dreiser, which typically represent characters who are joint victims of their instinctual drives and of external sociological forces; see naturalism. 1914-1939. The era between the two world wars, marked also by the trauma of the great economic depression beginning in 1929, was that of the emergence of what is still known as \"modern literature,\" which in America reached an eminence rivaling that of the American Renaissance of the mid- nineteenth century; unlike most of the authors of that earlier period, how\u00ad ever, the American modernists also achieved widespread international recognition and influence. (See modernism.) Poetry magazine, founded in Chicago by Harriet Monroe in 1912, published many innovative authors. Among the notable poets were Edgar Lee Masters, Edwin Arlington Robinson, Robert Frost, Carl Sandburg, Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Ezra Pound, Robinson Jeffers, Marianne Moore, T. S. Eliot, Edna St. Vincent Millay, and e. e. cummings\u2014authors who wrote in an unexampled variety of poetic modes. These included the Imagism of Amy Lowell, H. D. (Hilda Doolittle), PERIODS OF AMERICAN LITERATURE and others, the metric poems by Frost and the free-verse poems by Williams in the American vernacular, the formal and typographic experiments of cum- mings, the poetic naturalism of Jeffers, and the assimilation to their own dis\u00ad tinctive uses by Pound and Eliot of the forms and procedures of French symbolism, merged with the intellectual and figurative methods of the English metaphysical poets. Among the major writers of prose fiction were Edith Whar\u00ad ton, Sinclair Lewis, Ellen Glasgow, Willa Cather, Gertrude Stein, Sherwood Anderson, John Dos Passos, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Ernest Hem\u00ad ingway, Thomas Wolfe, and John Steinbeck. America produced in this period its first great dramatist in Eugene O'Neill, a well as a group of distinguished literary critics that included Van Wyck Brooks, Malcolm Cowley, T. S. Eliot, Edmund Wilson, and the irreverent and caustic H. L. Mencken. The literary productions of this era are often subclassified in a variety of ways. The flamboyant and pleasure-seeking 1920s are sometimes referred to as \"the Jazz Age,\" a title popularized by F. Scott Fitzgerald's Tales of the Jazz Age (1922). The same decade was also the period of the Harlem Renaissance, which produced major writings in all the literary forms by Countee Cullen, Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Jean Toomer, Zora Neale Hurston, and many other African-American writers. (See Harlem Renaissance.) Many prominent American writers of the decade following the end of World War I, disillusioned by their war experiences and alienated by what they perceived as the crassness of American culture and its \"puritanical\" re\u00ad pressions, are often tagged (in a term first applied by Gertrude Stein to young Frenchmen of the time) as the Lost Generation. A number of these writers became expatriates, moving either to London or to Paris in their quest for a richer literary and artistic milieu and a freer way of life. Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, and T. S. Eliot lived out their lives abroad, but most of the younger \"ex\u00ad iles,\" as Malcolm Cowley called them (Exile's Return, 1934), came back to America in the 1930s. Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises and Fitzgerald's Tender Is the Night are novels that represent the mood and way of life of two groups of American expatriates. In \"the radical '30s,\" the period of the Great Depres\u00ad sion and of the economic and social reforms in the New Deal inaugurated by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, some authors joined radical political movements, and many others dealt in their literary works with pressing social issues of the time\u2014including, in the novel, William Faulkner, John Dos Pas- sos, James T. Farrell, Thomas Wolfe, and John Steinbeck, and in the drama, Eugene O'Neill, Clifford Odets, and Maxwell Anderson. 1939 to the Present, the contemporary period. World War II, and espe\u00ad cially the disillusionment with Soviet Communism consequent upon the Moscow trials for alleged treason and Stalin's signing of the Russo-German pact with Hitler in 1939, largely ended the literary radicalism of the 1930s. A final blow to the very few writers who had maintained intellectual allegiance to Soviet Russia came in 1991 with the collapse of Russian Communism and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. For several decades the New Criticism\u2014 dominated by conservative southern writers, the Agrarians, who in the 1930s had championed a return from an industrial to an agricultural economy\u2014 PERIODS OF AMERICAN LITERATURE typified the prevailing critical tendency to isolate literature from the life of the author and from society and to conceive a work of literature, in formal terms, as an organic and autonomous entity (see John L. Stewart, The Burden of Time: The Fugitives and Agrarians, 1965). The eminent and influential critics Edmund Wilson and Lionel Trilling, however\u2014as well as other critics grouped with them as the New York Intellectuals, including Philip Rahv, Alfred Kazin, and Irving Howe\u2014continued through the 1960s to deal with a work of literature humanistically and historically, in the context of its author's life, temperament, and social milieu, and in terms of the work's moral and imagi\u00ad native qualities and its consequences for society. See V. B. Leitch, American Lit\u00ad erary Criticism from the Thirties to the Eighties, 1988, chapter 4. (For a discussion of radically new developments in American literary theory and criticism in the 1970s and later, see poststructuralism.) The 1950s, while often regarded in retrospect as a period of cultural con\u00ad formity and complacency, was marked by the emergence of vigorous anti- establishment and anti-traditional literary movements: the Beat writers such as Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac; the American exemplars of the literature of the absurd; the Black Mountain Poets, Charles Olson, Robert Creeley, and Robert Duncan; and the New York Poets Frank O'Hara, Kenneth Koch, and John Ashbery. It was also a time of confessional poetry and the literature of ex\u00ad treme sexual candor, marked by the emergence of Henry Miller as a notable author (his autobiographical and fictional works, begun in the 1930s, had ear\u00ad lier been available only under the counter) and the writings of Norman Mailer, William Burroughs, and Vladimir Nabokov (Lolita was published in 1955). The counterculture of the 1960s and early '70s continued some of these modes, but in a fashion made extreme and fevered by the rebellious youth movement and the vehement and sometimes violent opposition to the war in Vietnam; for an approving treatment of this movement, see Theodore Roszak, The Making of a Counter Culture (1969), and for a later retrospect, Morris Dickstein, Gates of Eden: American Culture in the Sixties (1978). See mod\u00ad ernism and postmodernism and for radical developments of this era in African- American literature, see Black Arts Movement. Important American writers after World War II include, in prose fiction, Vladimir Nabokov (who emigrated to America in 1940), Eudora Welty, Robert Penn Warren, Bernard Malamud, James Gould Cozzens, Saul Bellow, Mary McCarthy, Norman Mailer, John Updike, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr., Thomas Pynchon, John Barth, Donald Barthelme, E. L. Doctorow, and Cynthia Ozick; in poetry, Marianne Moore, Robert Penn Warren, Theodore Roethke, Elizabeth Bishop, Richard Wilbur, Robert Lowell, Allen Ginsberg, Adrienne Rich, Sylvia Plath, A. R. Ammons, and John Ashberry; and in drama, Thornton Wilder, Lillian Hellman, Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, and a number of more recent playwrights, including Sam Shepard, David Mamet, Tony Kush- ner, and Wendy Wasserstein. Many of the most innovative and distinguished literary work of the latter decades of the twentieth century have been written by writers who are often identified as belonging to one or another \"minority,\" or ethnic literary group. (An \"ethnic group\" consists of individuals who are 21 0 PERIODS OF ENGLISH LITERATURE distinguishable, within a majority cultural and social system, by shared char\u00ad acteristics such as race, religion, language, cultural modes, and national ori\u00ad gin.) There is, however, much contention, both within and outside these groups, whether it is more just and enlightening to consider such writers sim\u00ad ply as part of the American mainstream or to stress the identity of each writer as a participant in an ethnic culture with its distinctive subject matter, themes, and formal features. This is the era of the notable African-American novelists and essayists Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Albert Murray, Gloria Naylor, Alice Walker, and Toni Morrison; the poets Amiri Baraka (Leroi Jones), Gwendolyn Brooks, and Rita Dove; and the dramatists Lorraine Hansberry and August Wilson. It is also the era of the emergence of such prominent minority novelists as Leslie Marmon Silko (Native American); Oscar Hijuelos and Sandra Cisneros (Hispanic); and Maxine Hong Kingston and Amy Tan (Chinese American). See Houston A. Baker, ed., Three American Literatures: Essays in Chicano, Native American, and Asian-American Literature for Teachers of American Literature (1982). The contemporary literary scene in America is crowded and varied, and these lists could readily be expanded. We must await the passage of time to determine which writers now active will emerge as enduringly major figures in the canon of American literature. Periods of English Literature. For convenience of discussion, historians divide the continuity of English literature into segments of time that are called \"periods.\" The exact number, dates, and names of these periods vary, but the list below conforms to widespread practice. The list is followed by a brief comment on each period, in chronological order. 450-1066 Old English (or Anglo-Saxon) Period 1066-1500 Middle English Period 1500-1660 The Renaissance (or Early Modern) 1558-1603 Elizabethan Age 1603-1625 Jacobean Age 1625-1649 Caroline Age 1649-1660 Period (or Puritan Interregnum) 1660-1785 The Neoclassical Period 1660-1700 The Restoration 1700-1745 The Augustan Age (or Age of Pope) 1745-1785 The Age of Sensibility (or Age of Johnson) 1785-1830 The Romantic Period 1832-1901 The Victorian Period 1848-1860 The 1880-1901 Aestheticism and 1901-1914 The Edwardian 1910-1936 The Georgian Period 1914- The Modern Period 1945- Postmodernism PERIODS OF ENGLISH LITERATURE The Old English Period, or the Anglo-Saxon Period, extended from the invasion of Celtic England by Germanic tribes (the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes) in the first half of the fifth century to the conquest of England in 1066 by the Norman French under the leadership of William the Conqueror. Only after they had been converted to Christianity in the seventh century did the Anglo-Saxons, whose earlier literature had been oral, begin to develop a writ\u00ad ten literature. (See oral formulaic poetry.) A high level of culture and learning was soon achieved in various monasteries; the eighth-century churchmen Bede and Alcuin were major scholars who wrote in Latin, the standard lan\u00ad guage of international scholarship. The poetry written in the vernacular Anglo-Saxon, known also as Old English, included Beowulf (eighth century), the greatest of Germanic epic poems, and such lyric laments as \"The Wan\u00ad derer,\" \"The Seafarer,\" and \"Deor,\" all of which, though composed by Christ\u00ad ian writers, reflect the conditions of life in the pagan past. Caedmon and Cynewulf were poets who wrote on biblical and religious themes, and there survive a number of Old English lives of saints, sermons, and paraphrases of books of the Bible. Alfred the Great, a West Saxon king (871-99) who for a time united all the kingdoms of southern England against a new wave of Ger\u00ad manic invaders, the Vikings, was no less important as a patron of literature than as a warrior. He himself translated into Old English various books of Latin prose, supervised translations by other hands, and instituted the Anglo- Saxon Chronicle, a continuous record, year by year, of important events in England. See H. M. Chadwick, The Heroic Age (1912); S. B. Greenfield, A Critical His\u00ad tory of Old English Literature (1965); C. L. Wrenn, A Study of Old English Litera\u00ad ture (1966). Middle English Period. The four and a half centuries between the Nor\u00ad man Conquest in 1066, which effected radical changes in the language, life, and culture of England, and about 1500, when the standard literary language (deriving from the dialect of the London area) had become recognizably \"modern English\"\u2014that is, similar to the language we speak and write today. The span from 1100 to 1350 is sometimes discriminated as the Anglo- Norman Period, because the non-Latin literature of that time was written mainly in Anglo-Norman, the French dialect spoken by the invaders who had established themselves as the ruling class of England, and who shared a liter\u00ad ary culture with French-speaking areas of mainland Europe. Among the im\u00ad portant and influential works from this period are Marie de France's Lais (c.1180\u2014which may have been written while Marie was at the royal court in England), Guillaume de Lorris' and Jean de Meun's Roman de la Rose (12257-75?), and Chr\u00e9tien de Anglo-Saxon, but with extensive lexical and syntactic elements assimilated from Anglo-Norman, and known as \"middle English\"\u2014came into general literary use, it was at first mainly the vehicle for religious and homiletic writings. The first great age of primarily secular literature\u2014rooted in the Anglo-Norman, French, Irish, and Welsh, as well as the native English 21 2 PERIODS OF ENGLISH LITERATURE literature\u2014was the second half of the fourteenth century. This was the age of Chaucer and John Gower, of William Langland's great religious and satirical poem Piers Plowman, and of the anonymous master who wrote four major poems in complex alliterative meter, including Pearl, an elegy, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. This last work is the most accomplished of the English chivalric romances; the most notable prose romance was Thomas Malory's Morte d'Arthur, written a century later. The outstanding poets of the fifteenth century were the \"Scottish Chaucerians,\" who included King James I of Scot\u00ad land and Robert Henryson. The fifteenth century was more important for popular literature than for the artful literature addressed to the upper classes: it was the age of many excellent songs, secular and religious, and of folk bal\u00ad lads, as well as the flowering time of the miracle and morality plays, which were written and produced for the general public. See W. L. Renwick and H. Orton, The Beginnings of English Literature to Skelton (rev., 1952); H. S. Bennett, Chaucer and the Fifteenth Century (1947); Ed\u00ad ward Vasta, ed., Middle English Survey: Critical Essays (1965). The Renaissance, 1500-1660. There is an increasing use by historians of the term early modern to denote this era: see the entry Renaissance. Elizabethan Age. Strictly speaking, the period of the reign of Elizabeth I (1558-1603); the term \"Elizabethan,\" however, is often used loosely to refer to the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, even after the death of Eliz\u00ad abeth. This was a time of rapid development in English commerce, maritime power, and nationalist feeling\u2014the defeat of the Spanish Armada occurred in 1588. It was a great (in drama the greatest) age of English literature\u2014the age of Sir Philip Sidney, Christopher Marlowe, Edmund Spenser, Shakespeare, Sir Walter Raleigh, Francis Bacon, Ben Jonson, and many other extraordinary writ\u00ad ers of prose and of dramatic, lyric, and narrative poetry. A number of scholars have looked back on this era as one of intellectual coherence and social order; an influential example was E. M. W. Tillyard's The Elizabethan World Picture (1943). Recent historical critics, however, have emphasized its intellectual un\u00ad certainties and political and social conflicts; see new historicism. Jacobean Age. The reign of James I (in Latin, \"Jacobus\"), 1603-25, which followed that of Queen Elizabeth. This was the period in prose writings of Bacon, John Donne's sermons, Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, and the King James translation of the Bible. It was also the time of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies and tragicomedies, and of major writings by other notable poets and playwrights including Donne, Ben Jonson, Michael Drayton, Lady Mary Wroth, Sir Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, John Webster, George Chapman, Thomas Middleton, Philip Massinger, and Elizabeth Cary, whose notable biblical drama The Tragedy ofMar\u00ecam, the Faire Queene of Jewry was the first long play by an Englishwoman to be published. See Basil Willey, The Seventeenth Century Background (1934); Douglas Bush, English Literature in the Earlier Seventeenth Century (1945); C. V. Wedgewood, Seventeenth Century English Literature (1950). Caroline Age. The reign of Charles I, 1625-49; the name is derived from \"Carolus,\" the Latin version of \"Charles.\" This was the time of the English PERIODS OF ENGLISH LITERATURE 213 Civil War fought between the supporters of the king (known as \"Cavaliers\") and the supporters of Parliament (known as \"Roundheads/' from their cus\u00ad tom of wearing their hair cut short). John Milton began his writing during this period; it was the age also of the religious poet George Herbert and of the prose writers Robert Burton and Sir Thomas Browne. Associated with the court were the Cavalier poets, writers of witty and polished lyrics of courtship and gallantry. The group included Richard Lovelace, Sir John Suckling, and Thomas Carew. Robert Herrick, although a country parson, is often classified with the Cavalier poets because, like them, he was a Son of Ben\u2014that is, an admirer and follower of Ben Jonson\u2014in many of his lyrics of love and gallant compliment. See Robin Skelton, Cavalier Poets (1960). The Commonwealth Period, also known as the Puritan Interregnum, extends from the end of the Civil War and the execution of Charles I in 1649 to the restoration of the Stuart monarchy under Charles II in 1660. In this pe\u00ad riod England was ruled by Parliament under the Puritan leader Oliver Cromwell; his death in 1658 marked the dissolution of the Commonwealth. Drama almost disappeared for eighteen years after the Puritans closed the public theaters in September 1642, not only on moral and religious grounds, but also to prevent public assemblies that might foment civil disorder. It was the age of Milton's political pamphlets, of Hobbes' political treatise Leviathan (1651), of the prose writers Sir Thomas Browne, Thomas Fuller, Jeremy Taylor, and Izaak Walton, and of the poets Henry Vaughan, Edmund Waller, Abra\u00ad ham Cowley, Sir William Davenant, and Andrew Marvell. The Neoclassical Period, 1660-1785; see the entry neoclassic and romantic. Restoration. This period takes its name from the restoration of the Stuart line (Charles II) to the English throne in 1660, at the end of the Commonwealth; it is specified as lasting until 1700. The urbanity, wit, and licentiousness of the life centering on the court, in sharp contrast to the seriousness and sobriety of the earlier Puritan regime, is reflected in much of the literature of this age. The theaters came back to vigorous life after the revocation of the ban placed on them by the Puritans in 1642, although they became more exlusively oriented toward the aristocratic classes than they had been earlier. Sir George Etherege, William Wycherley, William Congreve, and John Dryden developed the dis\u00ad tinctive comedy of manners called Restoration comedy, and Dryden, Thomas Otway, and other playwrights developed the even more distinctive form of tragedy called heroic drama. Dryden was the major poet and critic, as well as one of the major dramatists. Other poets were the satirists Samuel Butler and the Earl of Rochester; notable writers in prose, in addition to the masterly Dryden, were Samuel Pepys, Sir William Temple, the religious writer in vernacular Eng\u00ad lish John Bunyan, and the philosopher John Locke. Aphra Behn, the first Eng\u00ad lishwoman to earn her living by her pen and one of the most inventive and versatile authors of the age, wrote poems, highly successful plays, and Oroonoko, the tragic story of a noble African slave, an important precursor of the novel. See Basil Willey, The Seventeenth Century Background (1934); L. I. Bredvold, The Intellectual Milieu of John Dryden (1932). PERIODS OF ENGLISH LITERATURE Augustan Age. The original Augustan Age was the brilliant literary pe\u00ad riod of Virgil, Horace, and Ovid under the Roman emperor Augustus (27 B.c.-A.D. 14). In the eighteenth century and later, however, the term was fre\u00ad quently applied also to the literary period in England from approximately 1700 to 1745. The leading writers of the time (such as Alexander Pope, Jonathan Swift, and Joseph Addison) themselves drew the parallel to the Roman Augustans, and deliberately imitated their literary forms and subjects, their emphasis on social concerns, and their ideals of moderation, decorum, and urbanity. (See neoclassicism.) A major representative of popular, rather than classical, writing in this period was the novelist, journalist, and pam\u00ad phleteer Daniel Defoe. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu was a brilliant letter- writer in a great era of letter-writing; she also wrote poems of wit and candor that violated the conventional moral and intellectual roles assigned to women in the Augustan era. Age of Sensibility. The period between the death of Alexander Pope in 1744, and 1785, which was one year after the death of Samuel Johnson and one year before Robert Burns' Poems, Chiefly in Scottish Dialect. (Alternative dates frequently proposed for the end of this period are 1789 and 1798; see Romantic Period.) An older name for this half-century, the Age of Johnson, stresses the dominant position of Samuel Johnson (1709-84) and his literary and intellectual circle, which included Oliver Goldsmith, Edmund Burke, James Boswell, Edward Gibbon, and Hester Lynch Thrale. These authors on the whole represented a culmination of the literary and critical modes of neo\u00ad classicism and the worldview of the Enlightenment. The more recent name, \"Age of Sensibility,\" puts its stress on the emergence, in other writers of the 1740s and later, of new cultural attitudes, theories of literature, and types of poetry; we find in this period, for example, a growing sympathy for the Mid\u00ad dle Ages, a vogue of cultural primitivism, an awakening interest in ballads and other folk literature, a turn from neoclassic \"correctness\" and its emphasis on judgment and restraint to an emphasis on instinct and feeling, the develop\u00ad ment of a literature of sensibility, and above all the exaltation by some critics of \"original genius\" and a \"bardic\" poetry of the sublime and visionary imagina\u00ad tion. Thomas Gray expressed this anti-neoclassic sensibility and set of values in his \"Stanzas to Mr. Bentley\" (1752): But not to one in this benighted age Is that diviner inspiration given, That burns in Shakespeare's or in Milton's page, The pomp and prodigality of Heaven. Other poets who showed similar shifts in thought and taste were William Collins and Joseph and Thomas Warton (poets who, together with Gray, began in the 1740s the vogue for what Samuel Johnson slightingly referred to as \"ode, and elegy, and sonnet\"), Christopher Smart, and William Cowper. Thomas Percy published his influential Reliques of Ancient English Poetry (1765), which included many folk ballads and a few medieval metrical romances, and James Macpherson in the same decade published his greatly doctored (and in PERIODS OF ENGLISH LITERATURE considerable part fabricated) versions of the poems of the Gaelic bard Ossian (Oisin) which were enormously popular throughout Europe. This was also the period of the great novelists, some realistic and satiric and some \"sentimental\": Samuel Richardson, Henry Fielding, Tobias Smollett, and Laurence Sterne. See W. J. Bate, From Classic to Romantic (1946); Northrop Frye, \"Toward Defining an Age of Sensibility,\" in Fables of Identity (1963), and ed. Romanti\u00ad cism Reconsidered (1965); F. W. Hilles and Harold Bloom, eds., From Sensibility to Romanticism (1965). Romantic Period. The Romantic Period in English literature is dated as beginning in 1785 (see Age of Sensibility)\u2014or alternatively in 1789 (the out\u00ad break of the French Revolution), or in 1798 (the publication of William Wordsworth's and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Lyrical Ballads)\u2014and as ending either in 1830 or else in 1832, the year in which Sir Walter Scott died and the passage of the Reform Bill signaled the political preoccupations of the Victo\u00ad rian era. For some characteristics of the thought and writings of this remark\u00ad able and diverse literary period, as well as for a list of suggested readings, see neoclassic and romantic. The term is often applied also to literary movements in European countries and America; see periods of American literature. Roman\u00ad tic characteristics are usually said to have been manifested first in Germany and England in the 1790s, and not to have become prominent in France and America until two or three decades after that time. Major English writers of the period, in addition to Wordsworth and Coleridge, were the poets Robert Burns, William Blake, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, and Wal\u00ad ter Savage Landor; the prose writers Charles Lamb, William Hazlitt, Thomas De Quincey, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Leigh Hunt; and the novelists Jane Austen, Sir Walter Scott, and Mary Shelley. The span between 1786 and the close of the eighteenth century was that of the Gothic romances by William Beckford, Matthew Gregory Lewis, William Godwin, and, above all, Anne Radcliffe. Victorian Period. The beginning of the Victorian Period is frequently dated 1830, or alternatively 1832 (the passage of the first Reform Bill), and sometimes 1837 (the accession of Queen Victoria); it extends to the death of Victoria in 1901. Historians often subdivide the long period into three phases: Early Victorian (to 1848), Mid-Victorian (1848-70), and Late Victorian (1870-1901). Much writing of the period, whether imaginative or didactic, in verse or in prose, dealt with or reflected the pressing social, economic, reli\u00ad gious, and intellectual issues and problems of that era. (For a summary of these issues, and also for the derogatory use of the term \"Victorian,\" see Victo\u00ad rian and Victorianism.) Among the notable poets were Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Robert Browning, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti, Matthew Arnold, and Gerard Manley Hopkins (whose remarkably innovative poems, however, did not become known until they were published, long after his death, in 1918). The most prominent essayists were Thomas Carlyle, John Ruskin, Arnold, and Walter Pater; the most distinguished of many excellent novelists (this was a great age of English prose fiction) were Charlotte and Emily Bront\u00eb, Charles Dickens, William Makepeace Thackeray, Elizabeth PERIODS OF ENGLISH LITERATURE Gaskell, George Eliot, George Meredith, Anthony Trollope, Thomas Hardy, and Samuel Butler. For prominent literary movements during the Victorian era, see the en\u00ad tries on Pre-Raphaelites, Aesthet\u00eccism, and Decadence. Edwardian Period. The span between the death of Victoria (1901) and the beginning of World War I (1914) is named for King Edward VII, who reigned from 1901 to 1910. Poets writing at the time included Thomas Hardy (who gave up novels for poetry at the beginning of the century), Alfred Noyes, William Butler Yeats, and Rudyard Kipling; dramatists included Henry Arthur Jones, Arthur Wing Pinero, James Barrie, John Galsworthy, George Bernard Shaw, and the playwrights of the Celtic Revival such as Lady Gregory, Yeats, and John M. Synge. Many of the major achievements were in prose fic\u00ad tion\u2014works by Thomas Hardy, Joseph Conrad, Ford Madox Ford, John Galsworthy, H. G. Wells, Rudyard Kipling, and Henry James, who published his major final novels, The Wings of the Dove, The Ambassadors, and The Golden Bowl, between 1902 and 1904. Georgian Period is a term applied both to the reigns in England of the four successive Georges (1714-1830) and (more frequently) to the reign of George V (1910-36). Georgian poets usually designates a group of writers in the latter era who loomed large in four anthologies entitled Georgian Poetry, which were published by Edward Marsh between 1912 and 1922. Marsh fa\u00ad vored writers we now tend to regard as relatively minor poets such as Rupert Brooke, Walter de la Mare, Ralph Hodgson, W. H. Davies, and John Masefield. The term \"Georgian poetry\" has come to connote verse which is mainly rural in subject matter, deft and delicate rather than bold and passionate in man\u00ad ner, and traditional rather than experimental in technique and form. Modern Period. The application of the term \"modern,\" of course, varies with the passage of time, but it is frequently applied specifically to the litera\u00ad ture written since the beginning of World War I in 1914; see modernism and postmodernism. This period has been marked by persistent and multidimen- sioned experiments in subject matter, form, and style, and has produced major achievements in all the literary genres. Among the notable writers are the poets W. B. Yeats, Wilfred Owen, T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden, Robert Graves, Dylan Thomas, and Seamus Heaney; the novelists Joseph Conrad, James Joyce, D. H. Lawrence, Dorothy Richardson, Virginia Woolf, . . Forster, Al- dous Gordimer; the dramatists G. . Shaw, Sean O'Casey, Noel Coward, Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter, Caryl Churchill, Brendan Behan, Frank McGuinness, and Tom Stop- pard. The modern age was also an important era for literary criticism; among the innovative English critics were T. S. Eliot, I. A. Richards, Virginia Woolf, E R. Leavis, and William Empson. (See New Criticism.) This entry has followed what has been the widespread practice of includ\u00ad ing under \"English literature\" writers in the English language from all the British Isles. A number of the authors listed above, were in fact natives of Ire\u00ad land, Scotland, and Wales. Of the Modern Period especially it can be said that much of the greatest \"English\" literature was written by the Irish writers Yeats, PERSONA, TONE, AND VOICE 21 7 Shaw, Joyce, O'Casey, Beckett, Iris Murdoch, and Seamus Heaney. And in re\u00ad cent decades, some of the most notable literary achievements in the English language have been written by natives of recently liberated English colonies (who are often referred to as \"postcolonial authors\")/ including the South Africans Doris Lessing, Nadine Gordimer, and Athol Fugard; the West Indians Derek Walcott; the Nigerians Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka; and the novelists R. K. Narayan and Salman Rushdie. See post- colonial studies. The Postmodern Period is a name sometimes applied to the era after World War II (1939-45). See modernism and postmodernism and for recent in\u00ad novations in critical theory and practice, poststructuralism. Persona, Tone, and Voice. These terms, frequent in recent criticism, re\u00ad flect the tendency to think of narrative and lyric works of literature as a mode of speech, or in what is now a favored term, as discourse. To conceive a work as an utterance suggests that there is a speaker who has determinate personal qualities, and who expresses attitudes both toward the characters and materi\u00ad als within the work and toward the audience to whom the work is addressed. In his Rhetoric (fourth century B.C.), Aristotle, followed by other Greek and Roman rhetoricians, pointed out that an orator projects in the course of his oration an ethos, that is, a personal character, which itself functions as a means of persuasion. For example, if the impression a speaker projects is that of a person of rectitude, intelligence, and goodwill, the audience is instinc\u00ad tively inclined to give credence to such a speaker's arguments. The current concern with the nature and function of the author's presence in a work of imaginative literature is related to this traditional concept, and is part of the strong rhetorical emphasis in modern criticism. (See rhetoric, rhetorical criti\u00ad cism, and speech-act theory.) Specific applications of the terms \"persona,\" \"tone,\" and \"voice\" vary greatly and involve difficult concepts in philosophy and social psychology\u2014 concepts such as \"the self,\" \"personal identity,\" \"role-playing,\" and \"sincer\u00ad ity.\" This essay will merely sketch some central uses of these terms that have proved helpful in analyzing our experience of diverse works of literature. Persona was the Latin word for the mask worn by actors in the classical theater, from which was derived the term dramatis personae for the list of characters who play a role in a drama, and ultimately the English word \"per\u00ad son,\" a particular individual. In recent literary discussion \"persona\" is often applied to the first-person speaker who tells the story in a narrative poem or novel, or whose voice we hear in a lyric poem. Examples of personae, in this broad application, are the visionary first-person narrator of John Milton's Par\u00ad adise Lost (who in the opening passages of various books of that epic dis\u00ad courses at some length about himself); the Gulliver who tells us about his misadventures in Gulliver's Travels; the \"I\" who carries on most of the conver\u00ad sation in Alexander Pope's satiric dialogue Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot; the genial narrator of Henry Fielding's Tom Jones, who pauses frequently for leisurely dis\u00ad course with his reader; the speaker who talks first to himself, then to his sister, PERSONA, TONE, AND VOICE in William Wordsworth's \"Tintern Abbey\"; the Duke who tells the emissary about his former wife in Robert Browning's \"My Last Duchess\"; and the fan\u00ad tastic \"biographer\" who narrates Virginia Woolf's Orlando. Calling all such di\u00ad verse speakers \"personae\" serves to indicate that they are all, to some degree, adapted to the generic and formal requirements and the artistic aims of a par\u00ad ticular literary work. We need, however, to go on to make distinctions be\u00ad tween such speakers as Jonathan Swift's Gulliver and Browning's Duke, who are entirely fictional characters very different from their authors; the narra\u00ad tors in Pope's Epistle and Fielding's Tom Jones, who are presented as closer to their authors, although clearly shaped to fit the roles they are designed to play in those works; and the speakers in the autobiographical passages in Paradise Lost, in \"Tintern Abbey,\" and in \"Ode to a Nightingale,\" where we are invited to attribute the voice we hear, and the sentiments it utters, to the poet in his own person. In an influential discussion, I. A. Richards defined tone as the expression of a literary speaker's \"attitude to his listener.\" \"The tone of his utterance re\u00ad flects ... his sense of how he stands toward those he is addressing\" (Practical Criticism, 1929, chapters 1 and 3). In a more complex definition, the Soviet critic Mikhail Bakhtin said that tone, or \"intonation,\" is \"oriented in two di\u00ad rections: with respect to the listener as ally or witness and with respect to the object of the utterance as the third, living participant whom the intonation scolds or caresses, denigrates or magnifies.\" (\"Discourse in Life and Discourse in Art,\" in Bakhtin's Freudianism: A Marxist Critique, trans. 1976.) The sense in which the term is used in recent criticism is suggested by the phrase \"tone of voice,\" as applied to nonliterary speech. The way we speak reveals, by subtle clues, our conception of, and attitude to, the things we are talking about, our personal relation to our auditor, and also our assumptions about the social level, intelligence, and sensitivity of that auditor. The tone of a speech can be described as critical or approving, formal or intimate, outspoken or reticent, solemn or playful, arrogant or prayerful, angry or loving, serious or ironic, condescending or obsequious, and so on through numberless possible nu\u00ad ances of relationship and attitude both to object and auditor. In a literary nar\u00ad rative, the nanatee (the person or persons to whom the narrator addresses the story) is sometimes explicitly identified, but at other times remains an im\u00ad plied auditor, revealed only by what the narrator implicitly takes for granted as needing or not needing explanation or justification, and by the tone of the narrator's address. Feminist critics, for example, point out that much of the lit\u00ad erature by male authors assumes a male readership who share the narrator's views, interests, and values. See Judith Fetterley, The Resisting Reader (1978). Some current critical uses of \"tone\" are broader, and coincide in reference with what other critics prefer to call \"voice.\" Voice, in a recently evolved usage, signifies the equivalent in imaginative literature to Aristotle's \"ethos\" in a speech of persuasive rhetoric, and suggests also the traditional rhetorician's concern with the importance of the physical voice in an oration. The term in criticism points to the fact that we are aware of a voice beyond the fictitious voices that speak in a work, and a persona PERSONA, TONE, AND VOICE 21 9 behind all the dramatic personae, and behind even the first-person narrator. We have the sense, that is, of a pervasive authorial presence, a determinate in\u00ad telligence and moral sensibility, who has invented, ordered, and rendered all these literary characters and materials in just this way. The particular qualities of the author's ethos, or voice, in Henry Fielding's novel Tom Jones (1749) manifest themselves, among other things, in the fact that he has chosen to create the wise, ironic, and worldly persona who ostensibly tells the story and talks to the reader about it. The sense of a distinctive authorial presence is no less evident in the work of recent writers who, unlike Fielding, pursue a strict policy of authorial noninterference and by effacing themselves, try to give the impression that the story tells itself (see point of view). There is great diversity in the quality of the authorial mind, temperament, and sensibility which, by inventing, controlling, and rendering the particular fiction, pervades works\u2014 all of them \"objective\" or impersonal in \"The Killers,\" and William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury. For a particular em\u00ad phasis on the importance of the author's implicit presence as this is sustained from work to work, see critics of consciousness. For a discussion of the relation between a poet's speaking voice in real life and the qualities of his or her poem, refer to Francis Berry, Poetry and the Physical Voice (1962). Of the critics listed below who deal with this concept, Wayne C. Booth prefers the term implied author over \"voice,\" in order better to indicate that the reader of a work of fiction has the sense not only of the timbre and tone of a speaking voice, but of a total human presence. Booth's view is that this im\u00ad plied author is \"an ideal, literary, created version of the real man\"\u2014that is, the implied author, although related to the actual author, is nonetheless part of the total fiction, whom the author gradually brings into being in the course of his composition, and who plays an important role in the overall effect of a work on the reader. Critics such as Walter J. Ong, on the other hand, distin\u00ad guish between the author's \"false voice\" and his \"true voice,\" and regard the latter as the expression of the author's genuine self or identity; as they see it, for a writer to discover his true \"voice\" is to discover himself. All of these crit\u00ad ics agree, however, that the sense of a convincing authorial voice and presence, whose values, beliefs, and moral vision serve implicitly as controlling forces throughout a work, helps to sway the reader to yield the imaginative consent without which a poem or novel would remain an elaborate verbal game. Refer to Bakhtin's view of the multiplex voices in narrative fiction, in di\u00ad alogic criticism. See Richard Ellmann, Yeats: The Man and the Masks (1948), which discusses Yeats' theory of a poet's \"masks\" or \"personae,\" both in his life and his art; Reuben Brower, \"The Speaking Voice,\" in Fields of Light (1951); Wayne C.

The philosophical perspective and method called phenomenology was established by the German thinker Edmund Husserl (1859-1938). Husserl set out to analyze human conscious\u00ad ness\u2014that is, to describe the concrete \"Lebenswelt\" (lived world) as experi\u00ad enced independently of any prior suppositions, whether these suppositions come from philosophy or from common sense. He proposes that conscious\u00ad ness is a unified intentional act. By \"intentional\" he does not mean that it is deliberately willed, but that it is always directed to an \"object\"; in other words, to be conscious is always to be conscious of something. Husserl's claim is that in this unitary act of consciousness, the thinking subject and the object it \"intends,\" or is aware of, are interinvolved and reciprocally implicative. In order to free itself of prior conceptions, the phenomenological analysis of consciousness begins with an \"epoche\" (suspension) of all presuppositions about the nature of experience, and this suspension involves \"bracketing\" (holding in abeyance) the question whether or not the object of conscious\u00ad ness is real\u2014that is, whether or not the object exists outside the conscious\u00ad ness which \"intends\" it. Phenomenology has had widespread philosophical influence since it was put forward by Husserl in 1900 and later, and has been diversely developed by Martin Heidegger in Germany and Maurice Merleau-Ponty in France. It has greatly influenced Hans-Georg Gadamer and other theorists concerned with analyzing the conscious activity of understanding language (see interpretation and hermeneutics), and has, directly or indirectly, affected the way in which many critics analyze the experience of literature. In the 1930s the Polish theorist Roman Ingarden (1893-1970), who wrote his books both in Polish and German, adapted the phenomenological viewpoint and concepts to a formulation of the way we understand and re\u00ad spond to a work of literature. In Ingarden's analysis, a literary work originates in the intentional acts of consciousness of its author\u2014\"intentional\" in the phenomenological sense that the acts are directed toward an object. These acts, as recorded in a text, make it possible for a reader to re-experience the work in his or her own consciousness. The recorded text contains many ele\u00ad ments which are potential rather than fully realized, as well as many \"places of indeterminacy\" in what it sets forth. An \"active reading\" responds to the sequence of the printed words by a temporal process of consciousness which \"fills out\" these potential and indeterminate aspects of the text, and in so doing, in Ingarden's term, the reading concretizes the schematic literary work. Such a reading is said to be \"co-creative\" with the conscious processes recorded by the author, and to result in an actualized \"aesthetic object\" within the reader's consciousness which does not depict a reality that exists independently of the work, but instead constitutes a \"quasi-reality\"\u2014that is to say, its own fictional world. See Roman Ingarden, The Literary Work of Art (1931, trans. 1973), and The Cognition of the Literary Work of Art (1937, trans. 1973); also, the exposition in Eugene Falk, The Poetics of Roman Ingarden (1981). For German critics strongly influenced by Ingarden, see Wolfgang Iser under reader-response criticism, and Hans Robert Jauss under reception-theory. PHENOMENOLOGY AND CRITICISM The term phenomenological criticism is often applied specifically to the theory and practice of the Geneva School of critics, most of whose mem\u00ad bers taught at the University of Geneva, and all of whom were joined by friendship, interinfluence, and their general approach to literature. The older members of the Geneva School were Marcel Raymond and Albert B\u00e9guin; later members were Jean Rousset, Jean-Pierre Richard, and, most prominently, Georges Poulet. J. Hillis Miller, who for six years was a colleague of Poulet at Johns Hopkins University, was in his earlier career (before turning to decon- structive criticism) the leading American representative of the Geneva School of criticism, and applied this critical mode to the analysis of a variety of Amer\u00ad ican and English authors. Geneva critics regard each work of literature as a fictional world that is created out of the Lebenswelt of its author and embodies the author's unique mode of consciousness. In its approach to literature as primarily subjective, this criticism is opposed to the objective approach of formalism, both in its European variety and in American New Criticism. Its roots instead go back through the nineteenth century to that type of romantic expressive criticism which regarded a literary work as the revelation of the personality of its au\u00ad thor, and also proposed that the awareness of this personality is the chief aim and value of reading literature. (As early as 1778, for example, the German critic Johann Gottfried Herder wrote: \"This living reading, this divination into the soul of the author, is the sole mode of reading, and the most profound means of self-development.\") In the course of time, however, Geneva critics assimilated a number of the concepts and methods of Husserl, Heidegger, and other phenomenologists. In the view of the Geneva critics the \"cogito,\" or distinctive formations of consciousness, of the author\u2014related to, but not identical with, the author's \"empirical,\" or biographical, self\u2014pervades a work of literature, manifesting itself as the subjective correlate of the \"con\u00ad tents\" of the work; that is, of the objects, characters, imagery, and style in which the author's personal mode of awareness and feeling imaginatively projects itself. (For a related critical concept see voice; refer also to objective and subjective.) By \"bracketing\" their personal prepossessions and particularities, the readers of a literary work make themselves purely and passively receptive, and so are capable of achieving participation, or even identity, with the im\u00ad manent consciousness of its author. Their undertaking to read a work so as to experience the mode of consciousness of its author, and then to reproject this consciousness in their own critical writing about that work, underlies the fre\u00ad quent application to the Geneva School of the term critics of consciousness and the description of their aim in a critical reading of works of literature as \"consciousness of the consciousness of another.\" As Georges Poulet put it in \"Phenomenology of Reading\" (1969): \"When I read as I ought.. . with the total commitment required of any reader,\" then \"I am thinking the thoughts of another. . . . But I think it as my very own. . .. My consciousness behaves as though it were the consciousness of another.\" (It should be noted that whereas the philosopher Husserl's aim in phenomenology was to describe the essential features of consciousness which are common to all human beings, PHENOMENOLOGY AND CRITICISM the Geneva critics' quite different aim is to identify\u2014and also to identify one\u00ad self with\u2014the unique consciousness of each individual author.) Within this framework, critics of consciousness differ in the extent to which they attend to specific elements in the \"external\" contents, formal structure, and style of a text, on their way toward isolating its author's \"inte\u00ad rior\" mode of consciousness. A conspicuous tendency of most of these critics is to put together widely separated passages within a single work, on the princi\u00ad ple, as J. Hillis Miller says in his book Charles Dickens, that since all these pas\u00ad sages \"reveal the persistence of certain obsessions, problems, and attitudes,\" the critic may, by analyzing them, \"glimpse the original unity of a creative mind.\" Furthermore the critics of consciousness often treat a single work not as an individual entity, but as part of the collective body of an author's writ\u00ad ings, in order, as Miller said of Dickens, \"to identify what persists through all the swarming multiplicity of his novels as a view of the world which is unique and the same.\" Georges Poulet has also undertaken, in a number of books, to tell the history of the varying imaginative treatments of the topic of time throughout the course of Western literature, regarding these treatments as cor\u00ad relative with diverse modes of lived experience. In these histories Poulet sets out to identify \"for each epoch a consciousness common to all contemporary minds\"; he claims, however, that within this shared period-consciousness, the consciousness of each author also manifests its uniqueness. The influence of the criticism of consciousness reached its height in the 1950s and 1960s, then gave way to the explicitly opposed critical modes of structuralism and decon- struction. Many of its concepts and procedures, however, survive in some forms of reader-response criticism and reception-aesthetic. Robert R. Magliola, Phenomenology and Literature (1977), deals with vari\u00ad ous types of phenomenological poetics and criticism in the context of an ex\u00ad position of Husserl, Heidegger, and other phenomenological philosophers. Brief introductions to the Geneva School of criticism are Georges Poulet, \"Phenomenology of Reading,\" New Literary History 1 (1969-70), and J. Hillis Miller, \"The Geneva School. ..,\" in Modern French Criticism, ed. J. K. Simon (1972). In \"Geneva or Paris? The Recent Work of Georges Poulet,\" University of Toronto Quarterly 39 (1970), Miller indicates his own transition from the criti\u00ad cism of consciousness to the very different critical mode of deconstruction. A detailed study of the Geneva School is Sarah Lawall's Critics of Consciousness: The Existential Structures of Literature (1968); see also Michael Murray, Modern Critical Theory: A Phenomenological Introduction (1976). Among the writings of Geneva critics and other critics of consciousness available in English are Georges Poulet, Studies in Human Time (1949), The Interior Distance (1952), and The Metamorphoses of the Circle (1961); Jean Mary M. Jones (1991); J. Hillis Miller, Charles Dickens: The World of His Novels (1959), The Disappearance of God (1963), and Poets of Reality (1965). Other critical works influenced by phenomenology are Paul Brodtkorb, Ish- mael's White World: A Phenomenological Reading of Moby Dick (1965); David PLATONIC LOVE 223 Halliburton, Edgar Allan Poe: A Phenomenological View (1973); and Bruce John\u00ad son, True Conespondence: A Phenomenology of Thomas Hardy's Novels (1983). Platonic Love. In Plato's Symposium 210-212, Socrates recounts the doctrine about Eros (love) that, he modestly says, has been imparted to him by the wise woman Diotima. She bids us not to linger in the love evoked by the beauty in a single human body, but to mount up as by a stair, \"from one going on to two, and from two to all fair forms,\" then up from the beauty of the body to the beauty of the mind, until we arrive at a final contemplation of the Idea, or Form, of \"beauty absolute, separate, simple, and everlasting.\" From this beauty, in its own world of Ideas, the human soul is in exile, and of it the beauties of the body and of the world perceived by the senses are only distant, distorted, and impermanent reflections. Plotinus and other Neoplatonists (the \"new Pla- tonists,\" a school of Platonic philosophers of the third to the fifth century) de\u00ad veloped the view that all beauty in the sensible world\u2014as well as all goodness and truth\u2014is an \"emanation\" (radiation) from the One or Absolute, which is the source of all being and all value. From both Platonic and Neoplatonic sources, Christian thinkers of the Italian Renaissance, merging this concept of the Absolute with the personal God of the Bible, developed the theory that genuine beauty of the body is only the outer manifestation of a moral and spir\u00ad itual beauty of the soul, which in turn is rayed out from the absolute beauty of the one God Himself. The Platonic lover is irresistibly attracted to the bodily beauty of a beloved person, but reveres it as a sign of the spiritual beauty that it shares with all other beautiful bodies, and at the same time regards it as the lowest rung on a ladder that leads up from sensual desire to the pure contem\u00ad plation of Heavenly Beauty in God. Highly developed versions of this conception of Platonic love are to be found in Dante, Petrarch, and other writers of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and in many Italian, French, and English authors of sonnets and other love poems during the Renaissance. See, for example, the exposition in Book IV of Castiglione's The Courtier (1528), and in Edmund Spenser's \"An Hymn in Honor of Beauty.\" As Spenser wrote in one of the sonnets he called Amoretti (1595): Men call you fayre, and you doe credit it.... But only that is permanent and free From frayle corruption, that doth flesh ensew. That is true beautie: that doth argue you To be divine and borne of heavenly seed: Derived from that fayre spirit, from whom al true And perfect beauty did at first proceed. From this complex religious and philosophical doctrine, the modern notion that Platonic love is simply love that stops short of sexual gratification is a drastic reduction. The concept of Platonic love has fascinated some later poets, especially Shelley; see his \"Epipsychidion\" (1821). But his friend Byron took a skeptical 224 PLOT view of such lofty claims for the human Eros-impulse. \"Oh Plato! Plato!\" Byron sighed, you have paved the way, With your confounded fantasies, to more Immoral conduct by the fancied sway Your system feigns o'er the controlless core Of human hearts, than all the long array Of poets and romancers.... (Don Juan, I. cxvi.) See Plato's Symposium and Phaedrus, and the exposition of Plato's doc\u00ad trine of Eros, which Plato applied to homosexual as well as heterosexual love, in G. M. A. Grube, Plato's Thought (1935), chapter 3. Refer to J. S. Harrison, Platonism in English Poetry of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (1903); Paul Shorey, Platonism Ancient and Modern (1938); George Santayana, \"Platonic Love in Some Italian Poets,\" in Selected Critical Writings, ed. Norman Henfrey (2 vols., 1968), I, 41-59. Plot. The plot (which Aristotle termed the mythos) in a dramatic or narrative work is constituted by its events and actions, as these are rendered and ordered toward achieving particular artistic and emotional effects. This description is deceptively simple, because the actions (including verbal discourse as well as physical actions) are performed by particular characters in a work, and are the means by which they exhibit their moral and dispositional qualities. Plot and character are therefore interdependent critical concepts\u2014as Henry James has said, \"What is character but the determination of incident? What is incident but the illustration of character?\" (See character and characterization.) Notice also that a plot is distinguishable from the story\u2014that is, a bare synopsis of the temporal order of what happens. When we summarize the story in a literary work, we say that first this happens, then that, then that. ... It is only when we specify how this is related to that, by causes and motivations, and in what ways all these matters are rendered, ordered, and organized so as to achieve their particular effects, that a synopsis begins to be adequate to the plot. (On the distinction between story and plot see narrative and nanatology.) There are a great variety of plot forms. For example, some plots are de\u00ad signed to achieve tragic effects, and others to achieve the effects of comedy, romance, satire, or of some other genre. Each of these types in turn exhibits di\u00ad verse plot-patterns, and may be represented in the mode either of drama or of narrative, and either in verse or in prose. The following terms, widely current in traditional criticism, are useful in distinguishing the component elements of plots and in helping to discriminate types of plots, and of the characters appropriate to them, in both narrative and dramatic literature. The chief character in a plot, on whom our interest centers, is called the protagonist (or alternatively, the hero or heroine), and if the plot is such that he or she is pitted against an important opponent, that character is called the antagonist. Elizabeth Bennet is the protagonist, or heroine, of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (1813); Hamlet is the protagonist and King Claudius PLOT the antagonist in Shakespeare's play, and the relation between them is one of conflict. If the antagonist is evil, or capable of cruel and criminal actions, he or she is called the villain. Many, but far from all, plots deal with a conflict; Thornton Wilder's play Our Town (1938), for example, does not. In addition to the conflict between individuals, there may be the conflict of a protagonist against fate, or against the circumstances that stand between him and a goal he has set himself; and in some works (as in Henry James' Portrait of a Lady) the chief conflict is between opposing desires or values in the protagonist's own temperament. For the recent exploitation of an anti-traditional protago\u00ad nist, see antihero. A character in a work who, by sharp contrast, serves to stress and high\u00ad light the distinctive temperament of the protagonist is termed a foil. Thus Laertes the man of action is a foil to the dilatory Hamlet; the firebrand Hot\u00ad spur is a foil to the cool and calculating Prince Hal in Shakespeare's 1 Henry IV; and in Pride and Prejudice, the gentle and compliant Jane Bennet serves as a foil to her strong-willed sister Elizabeth. (\"Foil\" originally signified \"leaf,\" and came to be applied to the thin sheet of bright metal placed under a jewel to enhance its brilliance.) If a character initiates a scheme which depends for its success on the ig\u00ad norance or gullibility of the person or persons against whom it is directed, it is called an intrigue. Iago is a villain who intrigues against Othello and Cassio in Shakespeare's tragedy Othello. including Ben Jon- son's Volpone (1607) and many Restoration plays (for example, William Con- greve's The Way of the World and William Wycherley's The Country Wife), have plots which turn largely on the success or failure of an intrigue. As a plot evolves it arouses expectations in the audience or reader about the future course of events and actions and how characters will respond to them. A lack of certainty, on the part of a concerned reader, about what is going to happen, especially to characters with whom the reader has estab\u00ad lished a bond of sympathy, is known as suspense. If what in fact happens vi\u00ad olates any expectations we have formed, it is known as surprise. The interplay of suspense and surprise is a prime source of vitality in a traditional plot. The most effective surprise, especially in realistic narratives, is one which turns out, in retrospect, to have been grounded in what has gone before, even though we have hitherto made the wrong inference from the given facts of circumstance and character. As E. M. Forster put it, the shock of the unex\u00ad pected, \"followed by the feeling, 'oh, that's all right' is a sign that all is well with the plot.\" A \"surprise ending,\" in the pejorative sense, is one in which the author resolves the plot without adequate earlier grounds in characteriza\u00ad tion or events, often by the use of highly unlikely coincidence; there are numerous examples in the short stories of O. Henry. (For one type of manip\u00ad ulated ending, see deus ex machina.) Dramatic irony is a special kind of sus- penseful expectation, when the audience or readers foresee the oncoming disaster or triumph but the character does not. A plot is commonly said to have unity of action (or to be \"an artistic whole\") if it is apprehended by the reader or auditor as a complete and ordered PLOT structure of actions, directed toward the intended effect, in which none of the prominent component parts, or incidents, is nonfunctional; as Aristotle put this concept (Poetics, Sec. 8), all the parts are \"so closely connected that the transposai or withdrawal of any one of them will disjoint and dislocate the whole.\" Aristotle claimed that it does not constitute a unified plot to present a series of episodes which are strung together simply because they happen to a single character. Many picaresque narratives, nevertheless, such as Daniel Defoe's Moll Flanders (1722), have held the interest of readers for centuries with such an episodic plot structure; while even so tightly integrated a plot as that of Henry Fielding's Tom Jones (1749) introduces, for variety's sake, a long story by the Man of the Hill, which is related to the main plot by parallels and con\u00ad trasts. A successful later development which Aristotle did not foresee is the type of structural unity that can be achieved with double plots, familiar in Eliza\u00ad bethan drama. In this form, a subplot\u2014a second story that is complete and in\u00ad teresting in its own right\u2014is introduced into the play; when skillfully invented and managed, the subplot serves to broaden our perspective on the main plot and to enhance rather than diffuse the overall effect. The integral subplot may have the relation of analogy to the main plot (the Gloucester story in King Lear), or else of counterpoint against it (the comic subplot in\u00ad volving Falstaff in 1 Henry IV). Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene (1590-96) is an instance of a narrative romance which interweaves main plot and a mul\u00ad tiplicity of subplots into an intricately interrelated structure, in a way that the critic C. S. Lewis compares to the polyphonic art of contemporary Eliza\u00ad bethan music, in which two or more diverse melodies are carried on simulta\u00ad neously. The order of a unified plot, Aristotle pointed out, is a continuous se\u00ad quence of beginning, middle, and end. The beginning initiates the main ac\u00ad tion in a way which makes us look forward to something more; the middle presumes what has gone before and requires something to follow; and the end follows from what has gone before but requires nothing more; we feel satisfied that the plot is complete. The structural beginning (sometimes also called the \"initiating action,\" or \"point of attack\") need not be the initial stage of the action that is brought to a climax in the narrative or play. The epic, for example, plunges in medias res, \"in the middle of things\" (see epic), many short stories begin at the point of the climax itself, and the writer of a drama often captures our attention in the opening scene with a representative incident, related to and closely preceding the event which precipitates the central situation or conflict. Thus Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet opens with a street fight between the servants of two great houses, and his Hamlet with the apparition of a ghost; the exposition of essential prior matters\u2014the feud be\u00ad tween the Capulets and Montagues, or the posture of affairs in the Royal House of Denmark\u2014Shakespeare weaves rapidly and skillfully into the dia\u00ad logue of these startling initial scenes. In the novel, the modern drama, and especially the motion picture, such exposition is sometimes managed by flashbacks: interpolated narratives or scenes (often justified, or naturalized, as PLOT 227 a memory, a reverie, or a confession by one of the characters) which represent events that happened before the time at which the work opened. Arthur Miller's play Death of a Salesman (1949) and Ingmar Bergman's film Wild Strawberries make persistent and skillful use of this device. The German critic Gustav Freytag, in Technique of the Drama (1863), in\u00ad troduced an analysis of plot that is known as Freytag's Pyramid. He described the typical plot of a five-act play as a pyramidal shape, consisting of a rising action, climax, and falling action. Although the total pattern that Freytag de\u00ad scribed applies only to a limited number of plays, various of his terms are fre\u00ad quently echoed by critics of prose fiction as well as drama. As applied to Hamlet, for example, the rising action (a section that Aristotle had called the complication) begins, after the opening scene and exposition, with the ghost's telling Hamlet that he has been murdered by his brother Claudius; it continues with the developing conflict between Hamlet and Claudius, in which Hamlet, despite setbacks, succeeds in controlling the course of events. The rising action reaches the climax of the hero's fortunes with his proof of the King's guilt by the device of the play within a play (III. iL). Then comes the crisis, the reversal or \"turning point\" of the fortunes of the protagonist, in his failure to kill the King while he is at prayer. This inaugurates the falling action; from now on the antagonist, Claudius, largely controls the course of events, until the catastrophe, or outcome, which is decided by the death of the hero, as well as of Claudius, the Queen, and Laertes. \"Catastrophe\" is usu\u00ad ally applied to tragedy only; a more general term for this precipitating final scene, which is applied to both comedy and tragedy, is the denouement (French for \"unknotting\"): the action or intrigue ends in success or failure for the protagonist, the conflicts are settled, the mystery is solved, or the misun\u00ad derstanding cleared away. A frequently used alternative term for the outcome of a plot is the resolution. In many plots the denouement involves a reversal, or in Aristotle's Greek term, peripety, in the protagonist's fortunes, whether to the protagonist's fail\u00ad ure or destruction, as in tragedy, or success, as in comic plots. The reversal fre\u00ad quently depends on a discovery (in Aristotle's term, anagnorisis). This is the recognition by the protagonist of something of great importance hitherto un\u00ad known to him or to her: Cesario reveals to the Duke at the end of Shake\u00ad speare's Twelfth Night that he is really Viola; the fact of Iago's lying treachery dawns upon Othello; Fielding's Joseph Andrews, in his comic novel by that name (1742), discovers on the evidence of a birthmark\u2014\"as fine a strawberry as ever grew in a garden\"\u2014that he is in reality the son of Mr. and Mrs. Wilson. Since the 1920s, a number of writers of prose fiction and drama\u2014building on the example of Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy, so early as 1759-67\u2014 have deliberately designed their works to frustrate the expectations of chrono\u00ad logical order, coherence, reliable narration, and resolution that the reader or auditor has formed by habituation to traditional plots; some writers have even attempted to dispense altogether with a recognizable plot. (See, for example, literature of the absurd, modernism and postmodernism, antinovel, the new novel.) Also, various recent types of critical theory have altered or supplemented 228 POETIC DICTION many traditional concepts in the classification and analysis of plots. The arche\u00ad typal critic Northrop Frye reduced all plots to four types that reflect the myths corresponding to the four seasons of the year. Structuralist critics, who con\u00ad ceive diverse plots as sets of alternative conventions and codes for constructing a fictional narrative, analyze and classify these conventional plot forms on the model of linguistic theory. (See structuralist criticism and nanatology, and the discussion of plots in Jonathan Culler, Structuralist Poetics, 1975, pp. 205-24.) And some recent critical theorists have undertaken to explode entirely the tra\u00ad ditional treatments of plots, on the ground that any notion of the \"unity\" of a plot and of its \"teleological\" progress toward a resolution are illusory, or else that the resolution itself is only a facade to mask the irreconcilable conflicts and contradictions (whether psychological or social) that are the true compo\u00ad nents of any literary text. See under poststructuralism. For recent developments in the concept of plot, see narrative and nanatol\u00ad ogy. Refer to Aristotle, Poetics; E. M. Forster, Aspects of the Novel (1927); R. S.

Poetic Diction. The term diction signifies the types of words, phrases, and sentence structures, and sometimes also of figurative language, that consti\u00ad tute any work of literature. A writer's diction can be analyzed under a great va\u00ad riety of categories, such as the degree to which the vocabulary and phrasing is abstract or concrete, Latin or Anglo-Saxon in origin, colloquial or formal, technical or common. See style and poetic license. Many poets in all ages have used a distinctive language, a \"poetic dic\u00ad tion,\" which includes words, phrasing, and figures not current in the ordi\u00ad nary discourse of the time. In modern discussion, however, the term poetic diction is applied especially to poets who, like Edmund Spenser in the Eliza\u00ad bethan age or G. M. Hopkins in the Victorian age, deliberately employed a diction that deviated markedly not only from common speech, but even from the writings of other poets of their era. And in a frequent use, \"poetic diction\" denotes the special style developed by neoclassic writers of the eigh\u00ad teenth century who, like Thomas Gray, believed that \"the language of the age is never the language of poetry\" (letter to Richard West, 1742). This neo\u00ad classic poetic diction was in large part derived from the characteristic usage of admired earlier poets such as the Roman Virgil, Edmund Spenser, and John Milton, and was based on the reigning principle of decorum, according to which a poet must adapt the \"level\" and type of his diction to the mode and status of a particular genre (see style). Formal satire, such as Alexander Pope's Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot (1735), because it represented a poet's direct POETIC DICTION 229 commentary on everyday matters, permitted\u2014indeed required\u2014the use of language really spoken by urbane and cultivated people of the time. But what were ranked as the higher genres, such as epic, tragedy, and ode, re\u00ad quired a refined and elevated poetic diction to raise the style to the level of the form, while pastoral and descriptive poems, which necessitated reference to what were considered lowly materials, used a special diction to invest these materials with a dignity and elegance appropriate to poetry. Prominent characteristics of eighteenth-century poetic diction were its archaism and its use of recurrent epithets; its preference for resounding words derived from Latin (\"refulgent,\" \"irriguous,\" \"umbrageous\"); the frequent in\u00ad vocations to, and personifications of, abstractions and inanimate objects; and the persistent use of periphrasis (a roundabout, elaborate way of saying something) to avoid what were perceived as low, technical, or commonplace terms by means of a substitute phrase that was thought to be of higher dignity and decorum. Among the many periphrases in James Thomson's The Seasons . . . the inverted silk she drew\" instead of \"she took off her silk stocking.\" The following stanza from Thomas Gray's excellent period piece, \"Ode on a Distant Prospect of Eton College\" (1747), manifests all these devices of neoclassic poetic diction. Contemporary readers took special plea\u00ad sure in the ingenuity of the periphrases by which Gray, to achieve the stylistic elevation appropriate to an ode, managed to describe schoolboys at play while evading the use of common, hence what were considered to be unpo- etic, words such as \"swim,\" \"cage,\" Say, Father Thames, for thou hast seen Full many a sprightly race Disporting on thy margent green The paths of pleasure trace; Who foremost now delight to cleave With pliant arm thy glassy wave? The captive linnet which enthrall? What idle progeny succeed To chase the rolling circle's speed, Or urge the flying ball? In William Wordsworth's famed attack on the neoclassic doctrine of a spe\u00ad cial language for poetry, in his preface of 1800 to Lyrical Ballads, he claimed that there is no \"essential difference between the language of prose and metri\u00ad cal composition\"; decried the poetic diction of eighteenth-century writers as \"artificial,\" \"vicious,\" and \"unnatural\"; set up as the criterion for a valid poetic language that it be, not a matter of artful contrivance, but the \"spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings\"; and, by a drastic reversal of the class-hierarchy of linguistic decorum, claimed that the best model for the natural expression of feeling is not upper-class speech, but the speech of \"humble and rustic life.\" See Thomas Quayle, Poetic Diction: A Study of Eighteenth-Century Verse (1924); Geoffrey Tillotson, \"Eighteenth-Century Poetic Diction\" (1942), reprinted in Eighteenth-Century English Literature, ed. James L. Clifford (1959); 230 POETIC JUSTICE \u00b7 POETIC LICENSE J. Arthos, The Language of Natural Description in Eighteenth-Century Poetry (1949); M. H. Abrams, \"Wordsworth and Coleridge on Diction and Figures/' in The Conespondent Breeze (1984). For general treatments of the diverse vo\u00ad cabularies of poets, refer to Owen Barfield, Poetic Diction (rev., 1973), and Winifred Novotny, The Language Poets Use (1962). Poetic Justice was a term coined by Thomas Rymer, an English critic of the later seventeenth century, to signify the distribution, at the end of a literary work, of earthly rewards and punishments in proportion to the virtue or vice of the various characters. Rymer's view was that a poem (in a sense that in\u00ad cludes dramatic tragedy) is an ideal realm of its own, and should be governed by ideal principles of decorum and morality and not by the random way things often work out in the real world. No important critics or literary writers since Rymer's day have acceded, in any but a highly qualified way, to his rigid rec\u00ad ommendation of poetic justice; it would, for example, destroy the possibility of tragic suffering, which exceeds what the protagonist has deserved because of his or her tragic flaw. See Introduction to The Critical Works of Thomas Rymer, ed. Curt A. Zi- mansky (1956); M. A. Quinlan, Poetic Justice in the Drama (1912). Poetic License. John Dryden in the late seventeenth century defined poetic license as \"the liberty which poets have assumed to themselves, in all ages, of speaking things in verse which are beyond the severity of prose.\" In its most common use the term is confined to diction alone, to justify the poet's depar\u00ad ture from the rules and conventions of standard spoken and written prose in matters such as syntax, word order, the use of archaic or newly coined words, and the conventional use of eye-rhymes (wind-bind, daughter-laughter). The degree and kinds of linguistic freedom assumed by poets have varied accord\u00ad ing to the conventions of each age, but in every case the justification of the freedom lies in the success of the effect. The great opening sentence of Mil\u00ad ton's Paradise Lost (1667), for example, departs radically, but with eminent success, from the colloquial language of his time in the choice and order of words, in idiom and figurative construction, and in syntax, to achieve a dis\u00ad tinction of language and grandeur of announcement commensurate with Milton's high subject and the tradition of the epic form. In a broader sense \"poetic license\" is applied not only to language, but to all the ways in which poets and other literary authors are held to be free to vi\u00ad olate, for special effects, the ordinary norms not only of common discourse but also of literal and historical truth, including the devices of meter and rhyme, the recourse to literary conventions, and the representation of fictional characters and events. In 1 Henry IV, for example, Shakespeare follows Samuel Daniel's history in verse of the Wars of the Roses by making the valiant Hot\u00ad spur much younger than he was in fact, in order to serve as a more effective foil to the apparently dissolute Prince Hal. A special case is anachronism\u2014the placing of an event or person or thing outside of its historical era. Shakespeare described his Cleopatra as wearing Elizabethan corsets; and in Julius Caesar, POINT OF VIEW which is set in ancient Rome, he introduced a clock that strikes the hour. The term \"poetic license\" is sometimes extended to a poet's violation of fact from ignorance, as well as by design. It need not diminish our enjoyment of the work that Shakespeare attributed a seacoast to landlocked Bohemia in The Winter's Tale, or that Keats, in writing \"On First Looking into Chapman's Homer\" (1816), mistakenly made Cortez instead of Balboa the discoverer of the Pacific Ocean. See Geoffrey N. Leech, A Linguistic Guide to English Poetry (1969), chapter 3, \"Varieties of Poetic License.\" For the view by Russian Formalists that vari\u00ad eties of poetic license are used to refresh our perceptions of literary language and of the world it represents, see Victor Erlich, Russian Formalism (1965). Point of View signifies the way a story gets told\u2014the mode (or modes) es\u00ad tablished by an author by means of which the reader is presented with the characters, dialogue, actions, setting, and events which constitute the nana- tive in a work of fiction. The question of point of view has always been a prac\u00ad tical concern of the novelist, and there have been scattered observations on the matter in critical writings since the emergence of the modern novel in the eighteenth century. Henry James' prefaces to his various novels, however\u2014 collected as The Art of the Novel in 1934\u2014and Percy Lubbock's The Craft of Fic\u00ad tion (1926), which codified and expanded upon James' comments, made point of view one of the most prominent and persistent concerns in modern treatments of the art of prose fiction. Authors have developed many different ways to present a story, and many single works exhibit a diversity of methods. The simplified classifica\u00ad tion below, however, is widely recognized and can serve as a preliminary frame of reference for analyzing traditional types of narration and for deter\u00ad mining the predominant type in mixed narrative modes. It deals first with by far the most widely used modes, first-person and third-person narration. It es\u00ad tablishes a broad distinction between these two modes, then divides third- person narratives into subclasses according to the degree and kind of freedom or limitation which the author assumes in getting the story across to the reader. It then goes on to deal briefly with the rarely used mode of second- person narration. In a third-person narrative, the narrator is someone outside the story proper who refers to all the characters in the story by name, or as \"he,\" \"she,\" \"they.\" Thus Jane Austen's Emma begins: \"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\" In a first-person nar\u00ad rative, the narrator speaks as \"I,\" and is to a greater or lesser degree a partici\u00ad pant in the story.

Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye (1951) begins: \"If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll really want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap. ...\" POINT OF VIEW I Third-person points of view (1) The omniscient point of view. This is a common term for the many and varied works of fiction written in accord with the convention that the narrator knows everything that needs to be known about the agents, actions, and events, and has privileged access to the charac\u00ad ters' thoughts, feelings, and motives; also that the narrator is free to move at will in time and place, to shift from character to character, and to report (or conceal) their speech, doings, and states of con\u00ad sciousness. Within this mode, the intrusive narrator is one who not only reports, but also comments on and evaluates the actions and motives of the characters, and sometimes expresses personal views about human life in general. Most works are written according to the con\u00ad vention that the omniscient narrator's reports and judgments are to be taken as authoritative by the reader, and so serve to establish what counts as the true facts and values within the fictional world. This is the fashion in which many of the greatest novelists have written, in\u00ad cluding Fielding, Jane Austen, Charles Makepeace Thackeray, George Eliot, Thomas Hardy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Leo Tolstoy. (In Fielding's Tom Jones and Tolstoy's War and Peace, 1863-69, the intrusive narrator goes so far as to interpolate commentary, or short essays suggested by the subject matter of the novels.) On the other hand, the omniscient narrator may choose to be unintrusive (alternative terms are impersonal or objective). Flaubert in Madame Bovary (1857), for example, for the most part describes, reports, or \"shows\" the action in dramatic scenes without introducing his own comments or judgments. More radical instances of the unintrusive narrator, who gives up even the privilege of access to inner feelings and motives, are to be found in a number of Ernest Hemingway's short stories; for example, \"The Killers,\" and \"A Clean, Well-Lighted Place.\" (See showing and telling, under character.) For an extreme use of impersonal representation, see the comment on Robbe-Grillet's Jeal\u00ad ousy, under novel. G\u00e9rard Genette subtilized in various ways the analysis of third- person point of view. For example, he distinguishes between focus of narration (who tells the story) and focus of character (who per\u00ad ceives what is told us in any part of the story). In Henry James' What Maisie Knew, for example, the focus of narration is an adult who tells the story, but his focus is on events as they are perceived and inter\u00ad preted by the character Maisie, a child. Both the focus of narration and the focus of character (that is, of perception) in a single story may shift rapidly from the narrator to a character in the story, and from one character to another. In To the Lighthouse, Virginia Woolf shifts the focus of character to each in turn of the principal participants in the story; and Hemingway's short story, \"The Short Happy Life of POINT OF VIEW 233 Francis Macomber,\" is a third-person narrative in which the focus of perception is, in various passages, the narrator, the hunter Wilson, Mrs. Macomber, Mr. Macomber, and even, briefly, the hunted lion. See G\u00e9rard Genette, Nanat\u00ecve Discourse: An Essay in Method (1972, trans. 1980). (2) The limited point of view. The narrator tells the story in the third person, but stays inside the confines of what is perceived, thought, re\u00ad membered and felt by a single character (or at most by very few char\u00ad acters) within the story. Henry James, who refined this narrative mode, described such a selected character as his \"focus,\" or \"mirror,\" or \"center of consciousness.\" In a number of James' later works all the events and actions are represented as they unfold before, and filter to the reader through, the particular perceptions, awareness, and re\u00ad sponses of only one character; for example, Strether in The Ambas\u00ad sadors (1903). A short and artfully sustained example of this limited narration is Katherine Mansfield's story \"Bliss\" (1920). Later writers developed this technique into stream-of-consciousness narration, in which we are presented with outer observations only as they impinge on the continuous current of thought, memory, feel\u00ad ings, and associations which constitute a particular observer's total awareness. The limitation of point of view represented both by James' \"center of consciousness\" narration and by the \"stream-of-conscious\u00ad ness\" narration sometimes used by James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, William Faulkner, and others, is often said to exemplify the \"self-effac\u00ad ing author,\" or \"objective narration,\" more effectively than does the use of an unintrusive but omniscient narrator. In the latter instance, it is said, the reader remains aware that someone, or some outside voice, is telling us about what is going on; the alternative mode, in which the point of view is limited to the consciousness of a character within the story itself, gives readers the illusion of experiencing events that evolve before their own eyes. For a revealing analysis, however, of the way even an author who restricts the narrative center of consciousness to a single character nonetheless communicates authorial judgments on people and events, and also controls the judgments evoked from the reader, see Ian Watt, \"The First Paragraph of The Ambassadors; An Explication,\" reprinted in James, The Ambassadors, \u00e9d. S. P. Rosenbaum (1964). See also persona, tone, and voice. II First-person points of view This mode, insofar as it is consistently carried out, limits the matter of the narrative to what the first-person narrator knows, experiences, in\u00ad fers, or can find out by talking to other characters. We distinguish between the narrative \"I\" who is only a fortuitous witness and audi\u00ad tor of the matters he relates (Marlow in Heart of Darkness and other works by Joseph Conrad); or who is a participant, but only a minor or 234 POINT OF VIEW peripheral one, in the story (Ishmael in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, Nick in F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby); or who is himself or her\u00ad self the central character in the story (Daniel Defoe's Moll Flanders, Charlotte Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye). Ralph Ellison's The Invisible Man manifests a complex narrative mode in which the protagonist is the first-person narrator, whose focus of character is on the perceptions of a third party\u2014white America\u2014to whose eyes the protagonist, be\u00ad cause he is black, is \"invisible.\" For a special type of first-person nar\u00ad rative, see epistolary novel. Ill Second-person points of view In this mode the story gets told solely, or at least primarily, as an ad\u00ad dress by the narrator to someone he calls by the second-person pro\u00ad noun \"you.\" This form of narration occurred in occasional passages of traditional fiction, but has been exploited in a sustained way only during the latter part of the twentieth century and then only rarely; the effect is of a virtuoso performance. The French novelist Michel Butor, in La Modification (1957, trans, as Second Thoughts, 1981), the Italian novelist Italo Calvino in If on a Winter's Night a Traveler (trans, 1981), and the American novelist Jay Mclnerney in Bright Lights, Big City (1984), all tell their story with \"you\" as the nanatee. Mclnerney's Bright Lights, Big City, for example, begins: You are not the kind of guy who would be at a place like this at this time of the morning. But here you are, and you cannot say that the terrain is entirely unfamiliar, though the details are fuzzy. You are at a nightclub talking to a girl with a shaved head. The club is either Heartbreak or the Lizard Lounge. This second person may turn out to be a specific fictional character, or the reader of the story, or even the narrator himself or herself, or not clearly or consistently the one or the other; and the story may unfold by shifting between telling the narratee what he or she is now doing, has done in the past, or will or is commanded to do in the fu\u00ad ture. Italo Calvino uses the form to achieve a complex and comic form of involuted fiction, by involving \"you,\" the reader, in the fabri\u00ad cation of the narrative itself. His novel opens: You are about to begin reading Italo Calvino's new novel, If on a winter's night a traveler. Relax. Concentrate .. . Best to close the door, the TV is al\u00ad ways on in the next room. Tell the others right away, \"No, I don't want to watch TV!\" ... Or if you prefer, don't say anything; just hope they'll leave you alone. Refer to Brian Richardson; \"The Poetics Fludernick, \"Second-Person Case (1994); and in Contemporary POINT OF VIEW 235 Literature/' Comparative Literature Studies 2 (1965). Sean Matthew Andrews an\u00ad alyzes tactics of second-person narrative in short stories by Lorrie Moore, Frederick Barthelme, and Reynold Price in A Disquisition on Second Person Nar\u00ad rative, Senior Honors Thesis in English at the Pennsylvania State University, 1996. Two other frequently discussed narrative tactics are relevant to a consid\u00ad eration of points of view: The self-conscious narrator shatters any illusion that he or she is telling something that has actually happened by revealing to the reader that the nar\u00ad ration is a work of fictional art, or by flaunting the discrepancies between its patent fictionality and the reality it seems to represent. This can be done ei\u00ad ther seriously (Henry Fielding's narrator in Tom \u00a1ones and Marcel in Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, 1913-27) or for primarily comic purposes (Tristram in Laurence Sterne's Tristram Shandy, 1759-67, and the narrator of Lord Byron's versified Don Juan, 1819-24), or for purposes which are se\u00ad rious and comic (Thomas Carlyle's Sartor Resartus, 1833-34). See Robert Alter, Partial Magic: The Novel as a Self-Conscious Genre (1975), and refer to romantic irony. One variety of self-conscious narrative exploited in recent prose fiction is called the self-reflexive novel, or the involuted novel, which incorporates into its narration reference to the process of composing the fictional story itself. An early modern version, Andr\u00e9 Gide's The Counterfeiters (1926), is also one of the most intricate. As Harry Levin summarized its self-involution: it is \"the diary of a novelist who is writing a novel [to be called The Counterfeiters] about a novelist who is keeping a diary about the novel he is writing\"; the nest of Chinese boxes was further multiplied by Gide's publication, also in 1926, of his own Journal of The Counterfeiters, kept while he was composing the novel. Vladimir Nabokov is an ingenious exploiter of involuted fiction; for example, in Pale Fire (1962). See metaftction in the entry novel. We ordinarily accept what a narrator tells us as authoritative. The fallible or unreliable narrator, on the other hand, is one whose perception, interpre\u00ad tation, and evaluation of the matters he or she narrates do not coincide with the opinions and norms implied by the author, which the author expects the alert reader to share. (See the commentary on reliable and unreliable narrators in Wayne Booth, The Rhetoric of Fiction, 1961.) Henry James made repeated use of the narrator whose excessive innocence, or oversophistication, or moral obtuseness, makes him a flawed and distorting \"center of consciousness\" in the work; the result is an elaborate structure of ironies. (See irony.) Examples of James' use of a fallible narrator are his short stories \"The Aspern Papers\" and \"The Liar.\" The Sacred Fount and The Turn of the Screw are works by James in which, according to some critics, the clues for correcting the views of the fal\u00ad lible narrator are inadequate, so that what we are meant to take as factual within the story, and the evaluations intended by the author, remain prob\u00ad lematic. See, for example, the remarkably diverse critical interpretations col\u00ad lected in A Casebook on Henry James' \"The Turn of the Saew,\" ed. Gerald Willen (1960), and in The Turn of the Screw, ed. Robert Kimbrough (1966). The critic 236 POSTCOLONIAL STUDIES Tzvetan Todorov, on the other hand, has classified The Turn of the Saew as an instance of fantastic literature, which he defines as deliberately designed by the author to leave the reader in a state of uncertainty whether the events are to be explained by reference to natural causes (as hallucinations caused by the protagonist's repressed sexuality) or to supernatural causes. See Todorov's The Fantastic: A Structural Approach to a Literary Genre (trans. Richard Howard, 1973); also Eric S. Rabkin, The Fantastic in Literature (1976). Drastic experimentation in recent prose fiction has complicated in many ways traditional renderings of point of view, not only in second-person, but also in first- and third-person narratives; see fiction and persona, tone, and voice. On point of view, in addition to the writings mentioned above, refer to Nor\u00ad man Friedman, \"Point of View in Fiction,\" PMLA 70 (1955); Leon Edel, The Modern Psychological Novel (rev., 1964), chapters 3-4; Wayne C. Booth, The Rhetoric of Fiction (1961); Franz Stanzel, A Theory of Nanative (1979, trans. 1984); Susan Lanser, The Narrative Act: Point of View in Fiction (1981); Wallace Martin, Recent Theories of Nanative (1986). Postcolonial Studies. The critical analysis of the history, culture, litera\u00ad ture, and modes of discourse that are specific to the former colonies of Eng\u00ad land, Spain, France, and other European imperial powers. These studies have focused especially on the Third World countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean islands, and South America. Some scholars, however, extend the scope of such analyses also to the discourse and cultural productions of such countries as Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, which achieved independence much earlier than the Third World countries. Postcolonial studies sometimes en\u00ad compass also aspects of British literature in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, viewed through a perspective that reveals the extent to which the social and economic life represented in the literature was tacitly underwritten by colonial exploitation. An important text in establishing the theory and practice in this recently developed field of study was Orientalism (1978) by the Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said, which applied a revised form of Michel Foucault's his- toricist critique of discourse (see under new historicism) to analyze what he called \"cultural imperialism.\" This mode of imperialism imposed its power not by force, but by the effective means of disseminating in subjugated colonies a Eurocentric discourse that assumed the normality and preeminence of everything \"occidental,\" correlatively with its representations of the \"ori\u00ad ental\" as an exotic and inferior other. Since the 1980s, such analysis has been supplemented by other theoretical principles and procedures, including Al- thusser's redefinition of the Marxist theory of ideology and the deconstructive theory of Derrida. The rapidly expanding field of postcolonial studies, as a re\u00ad sult, is not a unified movement with a distinctive methodology. One can, however, identify several central and recurrent issues: (1) The rejection of the master-narrative of Western imperialism\u2014in which the colonial other is not only subordinated and marginalized, POSTCOLONIAL STUDIES 237 but in effect deleted as a cultural agency\u2014and its replacement by a counter-narrative in which the colonial cultures fight their way back into a world history written by Europeans. The influential collection of essays, The Empire Writes Back: Theory and Practice in Post-Colonial Litera\u00ad tures (1989), ed. Bill Ashcroft, Gareth Griffiths, and Helen Tiffins, stresses what it terms the hybridization of colonial languages and cultures, in which imperialist importations are superimposed on indigenous tradi\u00ad tions; it also includes a number of postcolonial countertexts to the hegemonic texts that present a Eurocentric version of colonial history. (2) An abiding concern with the formation, within Western discursive practices, of the colonial and postcolonial \"subject,\" as well as of the categories by means of which this subject conceives itself and per\u00ad ceives the world within which it lives and acts. (See subject under post- structuralism.) The subaltern has become a standard way to designate the colonial subject that has been constructed by European discourse and internalized by colonial peoples who employ this discourse; \"subaltern\" is a British word for someone of inferior rank, and com\u00ad bines the Latin terms for \"under\" (sub) and \"other\" (alter). A recurrent topic of debate is how, and to what extent, a subaltern subject, writ\u00ad ing in a European language, can manage to serve as an agent of resis\u00ad tance against, rather than of compliance with, the very discourse that has created its subordinate identity. See, e.g., Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\" (1988), reprinted in The Postcolo\u00ad nial Studies Reader, listed below. (3) A major element in the postcolonial agenda is to disestablish Euro\u00ad centric norms of literary and artistic values, and to expand the liter\u00ad ary canon to include colonial and postcolonial writers. In the United States and Britain, there is an increasingly successful movement to in\u00ad clude, in the standard academic curricula, the brilliant and innova\u00ad tive novels, poems, and plays by such postcolonial writers in the English language as the Africans Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka, the Caribbean islanders V. S. Naipaul and Derek Walcott, and the au\u00ad thors from the Indian subcontinent G. V. Desani and Salman Rushdie. See Homi Bhabha, The Location of Culture (1994); and for a survey of the large and growing body of literature in English by post- colonial writers throughout the world, see Martin Coyle and others, Encyclopedia of Literature and Criticism (1990), pages 1113-1236. A comprehensive anthology is The Post-Colonial Studies Reader (1995), ed. Bill Ashcroft, Gareth Griffiths, and Helen Tiffin. Refer also to Franz Fanon, The Wretched of the Earth (trans., 1966); Writing Postcoloniality and Feminism (1989); Terry Eagleton, Fredric Jameson, and Edward W. Said, Nationalism, Colonialism, and Literature (1990); Christopher L. Miller, Theories of Africans: Francophone Literature and Anthro\u00ad pology in Africa (1990); Edward W. Said, Culture and Imperialism (1993). 238 POSTSTRUCTURALISM Poststructuralism designates a broad variety of critical perspectives and procedures that in the 1970s displaced structuralism from its prominence as the radically innovative way of dealing with language and other signifying systems. A conspicuous announcement to American scholars of the poststruc\u00ad tural point of view was Jacques Derrida's paper on \"Structure, Sign and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences,\" delivered in 1966 to an International Colloquium at Johns Hopkins University. (The paper is included in Derrida's Writing and Difference, 1978.) Derrida attacked the systematic, quasi-scientific pretensions of the strict form of structuralism\u2014derived from Saussure's con\u00ad cept of the structure of language and represented by the cultural anthro\u00ad pologist L\u00e9vi-Strauss\u2014by asserting that the notion of a systemic structure, whether linguistic or other, presupposes a \"center\" that serves to organize and regulate the structure yet itself \"escapes structurality.\" In Saussure's theory of language, for example, this center is assigned the function of controlling the endless differential play of internal relationships, while remaining itself out\u00ad side of and immune from, that play. (See structuralism.) As Derrida's other writings make clear, he regards this incoherent and unrealizable notion of an ever-active yet always absent center as only one of the many ways in which all of Western thinking is \"logocentric\" or dependent on the notion of a self- certifying foundation, or absolute, or essence, or ground, which is ever- needed but never present. (See deconstruction.) Other contemporary thinkers, including Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan, and (in his later phase) Roland Barthes, although in diverse ways, also undertook to \"decenter\" or \"under\u00ad mine\" or \"subvert\" traditional claims for the existence of self-evident founda\u00ad tions that guarantee the validity of knowledge and truth, and establish the possibility of determinate communication. This antifoundationalism in phi\u00ad losophy, conjoined with skepticism about traditional conceptions of mean\u00ad ing, knowledge, truth, and the subject or \"self,\" is evident in some (although not all) current exponents of diverse modes of literary studies, including Marxist, feminist, new historicist, and reader-response criticism. In its extreme forms, the poststructural claim is that the workings of language inescapably undermine meanings in the very process of making such meanings possible, or else that every mode of discourse constructs or constitutes the very facts or truths that it claims to discover. \"Postmodern\" is sometimes used in place of, or interchangeably with, \"poststructural.\" It is more useful, however, to follow the example of those who apply \"postmodern\" to recent developments in literature and other arts, and reserve \"poststructural\" for recent theories of criticism and of intellectual inquiries in general. (See modernism and postmodernism.) Salient features or themes that are shared by diverse types of poststruc\u00ad tural thought and criticism include the following: (1) The primacy of theory. Since Plato and Aristotle, discourse about po\u00ad etry or literature has involved a \"theory,\" in the traditional sense of a conceptual scheme, or set of principles, distinctions, and categories\u2014 sometimes explicit, but often only implied in critical practice\u2014for POSTSTRUCTURALISM identifying, classifying, analyzing, and evaluating works of literature. (See criticism.) In poststructural criticism what is called \"theory\" has come to be foregrounded, so that many critics have felt it incumbent to \"theorize\" their position and practice. The nature of theory, however, is conceived in a new way; for the word theory, standing without qualification, often designates an account of the general con\u00ad ditions of signification that determine meaning and interpretation in all domains of human action, production, and intellection. In most cases, this account is held to apply not only to verbal language, but also to psychosexual and sociocultural signifying systems. As a conse\u00ad quence, the pursuit of literary criticism is conceived to be integral with all the other pursuits traditionally distinguished as the \"human sciences,\" and to be inseparable from consideration of the general na\u00ad ture of human \"subjectivity,\" and also from reference to all forms of social and cultural phenomena. Often the theory of signification is afforded primacy in the additional sense that, when common experi\u00ad ence in the use or interpretation of language does not accord with what the theory entails, such experience is rejected as unjustified and illusory, or else is accounted an ideologically imposed concealment of the actual operation of the signifying system. A prominent aspect of poststructural theories is that they are posed in opposition to inherited ways of thinking in all provinces of knowledge. That is, they expressly \"challenge\" and undertake to \"destabilize,\" and in many instances to \"undermine\" and \"subvert,\" what they identify as the foundational assumptions, concepts, proce\u00ad dures, and findings in traditional modes of discourse in Western civi\u00ad lization (including literary criticism). In a number of politically oriented critics, this questioning of established ways of thinking and of formulating knowledge is joined to an adversarial stance toward the established institutions, class structures, and practices of political power and social organization. (2) The decentering of the subject. The oppositional stance of many poststructural critics is manifested in a sharp critique of what they call \"humanism\"; that is, of the traditional view that the author\u2014or more generally, the human \"subject\"\u2014is a coherent identity, en\u00ad dowed with purpose and initiative, whose design and intentions ef\u00ad fectuate the form and meaning of a literary or other written product. (See humanism.) Structuralism had already tended to divest the sub\u00ad ject of operative initiative and control, evacuating the purposive human agent into a mere location, or \"space,\" wherein the differen\u00ad tial elements and codes of a systematic langue precipitate into a par\u00ad ticular parole, or signifying product. Derrida, however, by deleting the structural linguistic \"center,\" had thereby also eliminated the possi\u00ad bility of a controlling agency in language, leaving the use of language an unregulatable play of purely relational elements. In the view of many deconstruct!ve critics, the subject or author or narrator of a text 240 POSTSTRUCTURALISM becomes itself a purely linguistic product\u2014as Paul de Man has put it in Allegories of Reading (1979), we \"rightfully reduce\" the subject \"to the status of a mere grammatical pronoun.\" Alternatively, the subject- author is granted at most the function of trying (although always vainly) to \"master\" the incessant freeplay of the decentered Roland Barthes both signalized this evacua\u00ad tion of the traditional conception of the author by announcing the \"disappearance of the author,\" or even more melodramatically, \"the death of the author.\" \"What of the Au\u00ad thor/' 1968, in Image, Music, Text, 1977.) They did not mean to deny that a human individual is a necessary link in the chain of events that results in a parole or text. What they denied was the validity of the \"function,\" or \"role\" hitherto assigned in Western thought to a uniquely individual and purposive author, who is conceived as the \"cogito,\" or origin of all knowledge; as the initiator, purposive plan\u00ad ner, and (by his or her intentions) the determiner of the form and meanings of a text; and as the \"center,\" or organizing principle, of the matters treated in traditional literary criticism and literary history. In addition, a number of current forms of psychoanalytic, Marxist, and new historicist criticism manifest a similar tendency to decenter, and in extreme cases to delete what is often called the \"agency\" of the au\u00ad thor as a self-coherent, purposive, and determinative human subject. Instead, the human being is said to be a disunified self that is the product of diverse psychosexual conditions, and subjected to the un\u00ad controllable workings of unconscious compulsions. Alternatively, the subject is held to be a \"construction\" by current forms of ideology; or a \"site\" the \"cultural constructs\" and the \"discursive for\u00ad mations\" engendered by the conceptual and power configurations in a given era. (See author and authorship.) (3) Reading, texts, and writing. The decentering or deletion of the author leaves the reader, or interpreter, as the focal figure in poststructural accounts of signifying practices. This figure, however, like the author, is stripped of the traditional attributes of purposiveness and initiative and converted into an impersonal process called \"reading.\" What this reading engages is no longer called a literary \"work\" (since this tradi\u00ad tional term implies a purposive human maker of the product); in\u00ad stead, reading engages a \"text\"\u2014that is, a structure of signifiers regarded merely as a given for the reading process. Texts in their turn (especially in deconstructive criticism) lose their individuality, and are often represented as manifestations of \u00e9criture\u2014that is, of an all- inclusive \"textuality,\" or writing-in-general, in which the traditional \"boundaries\" between literary, philosophical, historical, legal, and other classes of texts are considered to be both artificial and superfi\u00ad cial. See text and writing (\u00e9criture). POSTSTRUCTURALISM A distinctive poststructural view is that no text can mean what it seems to say. To a deconstructive critic, for example, a text is a chain of signifiers whose seeming determinacy of meaning, and seeming reference to an extra-textual world, are \"effects\" produced by the dif\u00ad ferential play of conflicting internal forces which, on a closer analy\u00ad sis, turn out to deconstruct the text into an undecidable scatter of opposed significations. In the representation of Roland Barthes, the \"death\" of the author frees the reader to enter the literary text in whatever way he or she chooses, and the intensity of pleasure yielded by the text becomes proportionate to the reader's abandonment of limits on its signifying possibilities. In Stanley Fish's version of reader- response criticism, all the meanings and formal features seemingly found in a text are projected into the printed marks by each individ\u00ad ual reader; any agreement about meaning between two individuals is contingent upon their belonging to a single one among many \"inter\u00ad pretive communities.\" (4) The concept of discourse. Literary critics had long made casual use of the term \"discourse,\" especially in application to passages represent\u00ad ing conversations between characters in a literary work, and in the 1970s there developed a critical practice called discourse-analysis which focuses on such conversational exchanges. This type of criti\u00ad cism (as well as the dialogic criticism inaugurated by Mikhail Bakhtin) deals with literary discourse as conducted by human characters whose voices engage in a dynamic interchange of beliefs, attitudes, sentiments, and other expressions of states of consciousness. In poststructural criticism, discourse has become a very promi\u00ad nent term, supplementing (and in some cases displacing) \"text\" as the name for the verbal material which is the primary concern of literary criticism. In poststructural usage, however, the term is not confined to conversational passages but, like \"writing,\" designates all verbal con\u00ad structions and implies the superficiality of the boundaries between lit\u00ad erary and non-literary modes of signification. Most conspicuously, discourse has become the focal term among critics who oppose the de\u00ad constructive concept of a \"general text\" that functions independently of particular historical conditions. Instead, they conceive of discourse as social parlance, or language-in-use, and consider it to be both the product and manifestation not of a timeless linguistic system, but of particular social conditions, class-structures, and power-relationships that alter in the course of history. In Michel Foucault, discourse-as-such is the central subject of analytic concern. Foucault conceives that \"dis\u00ad course\" is to be analyzed as totally anonymous, in that it is simply \"sit\u00ad uated at the level of the 'it is said' (on dit).\" (The Archeology of Language, 1972, pp. 55, 122.) For example new historicists (for whom, in this re\u00ad spect, Foucault serves as a model) may attend to all Renaissance refer\u00ad ences to usury as part of an anonymous \"discourse,\" which circulates 242 POSTSTRUCTURALISM through legal, religious, philosophical, and economic writings of the era; it circulates also through those literary writings, such as Shake\u00ad speare's sonnets or The Merchant of Venice, in which usury is alluded to, whether literally or figuratively. Any allusion to usury is conceived to be better understood if it is referred to the total body of discourse on that topic, as well as to the social forces and institutions that have pro\u00ad duced the conception of usury in that time and place. (S) Many socially oriented analysts of discourse share with other poststruc- turalists the conviction (or at any rate the strong suspicion) that no text means what it seems to say, or what its writer intended to say. But whereas deconstructive critics attribute the subversion of the apparent meaning to the unstable and self-conflicting nature of language itself, social analysts of discourse\u2014and also psychoanalytic critics\u2014view the surface, or \"manifest\" meanings of a text as a disguise, or substitution, for underlying meanings which cannot be overtly said, because they are suppressed by psychic, or ideological, or discursive necessities. By some critics, the covert meanings are regarded as having been sup\u00ad pressed by all three of these forces together. Both the social and psy\u00ad choanalytic critics of discourse therefore interpret the manifest meanings of a text as a distortion, displacement, or total \"occlusion\" of its real meanings; and these real meanings, in accordance with the critic's theoretical orientation, turn out to be either the writer's psychic and psycho-linguistic compulsions, or the material realities of history, or the social power-structures of domination, subordination, and mar- ginalization that obtained when the text was written. The widespread poststructural view that the surface or overt meanings of a literary or other text serve as a \"disguise\" or \"mask\" of its real meanings, or sub\u00ad text, has been called, in a phrase taken from the French philosopher of language Paul Ricoeur, a hermeneutics of suspicion. The primacy of \"theory\" in poststructural criticism has evoked coun- tertheoretical challenges, most prominently in an essay \"Against Theory\" by Steven Knapp and Walter Benn Michaels that was published in 1982. Defin\u00ad ing theory (in consonance with the widespread poststructural use of the term) as \"the attempt to govern interpretations of particular texts by appealing to an account of interpretation in general,\" the two authors claim that this is an impossible endeavor \"to stand outside practice in order to govern practice from without,\" assert that accounts of interpretation in general entail no con\u00ad sequences for the actual practice of interpretation, and conclude that all the\u00ad ory \"should therefore come to an end.\" Such a conclusion is supported by a number of writers, including Stanley Fish and the influential philosophical pragmatist Richard Rorty, who (despite disagreements in their supporting ar\u00ad guments) agree that no general account of interpretation entails particular consequences for the actual practice of literary interpretation and criticism. (See W. J. T. Mitchell, ed., Against Theory: Literary Studies and the New Pragma\u00ad tism, 1985, which includes the initiating essay plus a supplementary essay by PRE-RAPHAELITES 243 Knapp and Michaels, together with essays and critiques by Fish, Rorty, E. D. Hirsch, and others.) The French philosopher Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard has also mounted an influential attack against \"theory,\" which he regards as an at\u00ad tempt to impose a common vocabulary and set of principles in order illegiti\u00ad mately to control and constrain the many independent \"language-games\" that constitute discourse; see his The Postmodern Condition (1984). One re\u00ad sponse to this skepticism about the efficacy of theory on practice (a skepti\u00ad cism that is often labeled the new pragmatism) is that, while no general theory of meaning entails consequences for the practice of interpretation (in the strict logical sense of \"entails\"), it is a matter of common observation that diverse current theories have in actual fact served both to foster and to cor\u00ad roborate a number of diverse and novel interpretive practices. (For a view of both the inescapability and practical functioning of literary and artistic the\u00ad ory in traditional criticism, see M. H. Abrams, \"What's the Use of Theorizing about the Arts?\" 1972, reprinted in Doing Things with Texts, 1989.)

In 1848 a group of English artists, including Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Holman Hunt, and John Millais, organized the \"Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood.\" Their aim was to replace the reigning academic style of painting by a return to the truthfulness, simplicity, and spirit of devo\u00ad tion which they attributed to Italian painting before the time of Raphael (1483-1520) and the high Italian Renaissance. The ideals of this group of painters were taken over by a literary movement which included Dante Gabriel Rossetti himself (who was a poet as well as a painter), his sister Christina Rossetti, William Morris, and Algernon Swinburne. Rossetti's poem \"The Blessed Damozel\" typifies the medievalism, the pictorial realism with symbolic overtones, and the union of flesh and spirit, sensuousness and reli\u00ad giousness, associated with the earlier writings of this school. See also Christina Rossetti's remarkable poem \"Goblin Market\" (1862) and William Morris' narrative in verse The Earthly Paradise (1868-70). 244 PRIMITIVISM AND PROGRESS William Gaunt, The Pre-Raphaelite Tragedy (1942); Graham Hough, The Last Romantics (1949). Primitivisin and Progress. A primitivist is someone who prefers what is \"natural\" (in the sense of that which exists prior to or independently of human culture, reasoning, and contrivance) to what is \"artificial\" (in the sense of what human beings achieve by thought, activities, laws and conven\u00ad tions, and the complex arrangements of a civilized society). A useful, al\u00ad though not mutually exclusive, distinction has been made between two manifestations of primitivism: (1) Cultural primitivism is the preference for what is conceived to be \"nature\" and \"the natural\" over \"art\" and \"the artificial\" in any area of human culture and values. As the intellectual historian A. O. Lovejoy has neatly summarized it, the \"natural\" is \"a thing you reach by going back and leaving out.\" For example, in ethics a cultural primitivist lauds the natural (that is, the innate) instincts and passions over the dictates of reason and prudential forethought. In social philosophy, the ideal is the simple and natural forms of social and political order in place of the anxieties and frustrations engendered by a complex and highly developed social organization. In milieu, a primitivist prefers outdoor \"nature,\" unmodified by human intervention, to cities or art\u00ad ful gardens. And in literature and the other arts, the primitivist lauds spontaneity, the free expression of emotion, and the intuitive produc\u00ad tions of \"natural genius,\" as against a calculated adaptation of artistic means to foreseen ends and a conformity to \"artificial\" forms, rules, and conventions. Typically, the cultural primitivist asserts that in the modern world, the life, activities, and products of \"primitive\" peo\u00ad ple\u2014who are considered to live in a way more accordant to \"nature\" because they are isolated from civilization\u2014are at least in some ways preferable to the life, activities, and products of people living in a highly developed society, especially in cities. The eighteenth-century cult of the Noble Savage\u2014who is conceived to be \"naturally\" intelli\u00ad gent, moral, and possessed of high dignity in thought and deed\u2014and the concurrent vogue of \"natural\" poetry written by supposedly uned\u00ad ucated peasants or working folk, were both aspects of primitivism. Cultural primitivism has played an especially prominent and persis\u00ad tent role in American thought and literature, where the \"new world\" was early conceived in terms both of the classical golden age of the dis\u00ad tant past and the Christian millennium of the future. The American Indian was sometimes identified with the legendary Noble Savage, and the American pioneer was often represented as a new Adam who had cut free from the artifice and corruptions of European civilization in order to reassume a \"natural\" life of freedom, innocence, and sim\u00ad plicity. See Henry Nash Smith, Virgin Land (1950), and R. W. B. Lewis, The American Adam (1955). PRIMITIVISM AND PROGRESS 245 (2) Chronological primitivism designates the belief that the ideal era of humanity's way of life lies in the very distant past, when men and women lived naturally, simply, and freely, and that the process of history has been a gradual \"decline\" from that happy stage into an increasing degree of artifice, complexity, inhibitions, prohibitions, and consequent anxieties and discontents in the psychological, so\u00ad cial, and cultural order. In its extreme form, the ideal era is postu\u00ad lated as having existed in \"the state of nature,\" before society and civilization had even begun; more commonly, it is placed at some later stage of development, and sometimes as late as the era of classi\u00ad cal Greece. Many, but not all, cultural primitivists are also chrono\u00ad logical primitivists. A historical concept that is antithetic to chronological primitivism emerged in the seventeenth century and reached its height in the nineteenth century. This is the idea of progress: the doctrine that, by virtue of the devel\u00ad opment and exploitation of art, science and technology, and human rational\u00ad ity, the course of history represents an overall improvement in the life, morality, and happiness of human beings from early barbarity to the present stage of civilization. Sometimes it is also claimed that this historical progress of humanity will continue indefinitely\u2014possibly to end in a final stage of so\u00ad cial, rational, and moral perfection. (See Enlightenment and Utopia.) Primitivism is as old as humanity's recorded intellection and imagin\u00ad ings, and is reflected in pagan myths of a vanished age of gold and a lost Garden of Eden. It achieved a special vogue, however, in the eighteenth century, by way of reaction to the prevailing stress on artfulness and the re\u00ad finements of civilization during the Neoclassic Period, in a European move\u00ad ment in which Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-78) was a central figure. D. H. Lawrence (1885-1930) is a later example of a broadly primitivistic thinker, in his laudation of the spontaneous instinctual life, his belief in an ancient, vanished condition of humanity's personal and social wholeness, his high regard for \"primitive\" modes of life that still survive outside the bounds of sophisticated societies, and his attacks on the disintegrative effects of mod\u00ad ern science and technology and on the economy and culture these develop\u00ad ments have generated. There are also strains of primitivism in, for example, James Fenimore Cooper's Leather-Stocking Tales, in Mark Twain's Huckleberry outlook and life-style of drop-outs, \"hippies,\" and related subcultures in our own time, as well as in the recent establishment of com\u00ad munes whose ideal is a radically simplified individual and social life close to the soil. But most men and women, and many writers of literature, are primitivists in some moods, longing to escape from the complexities, fever, anxieties, and \"alienation\" of modern civilization into the elemental sim\u00ad plicities of a lost natural life. That imagined life may be identified with the individual's own childhood, or with the prehistoric or classical or medieval past, or may be conceived as existing still in some primitive, carefree, far\u00ad away place on earth. 246 PROBLEM PLAY \u00b7 PROSE See . . Fairchild, The Noble Savage (1928); J. B. Bury, The Idea of Progress (1932); Lois Whitney, Pr\u00ecmit\u00ecvism and Ideas of Progress (1934); A. O. Lovejoy and George Boas, Pr\u00ecmit\u00ecvism and Related Ideas in Antiquity (1948); A. O. Love- joy, Essays in the History of Ideas (1948); Clifford Geertz, Local Knowledge (1983). Friedrich Nietzsche's The Genealogy of Morals (1887) and Sigmund (1949\u2014see psychoanalysis) involve as\u00ad pects of cultural primitivism, in their stress on the compelling needs of the body and of the elemental human instincts, especially sexuality, which re\u00ad quire a complex and perhaps impossible reconciliation with the repressions and inhibitions that are inescapable in a civilized society. A work of radical cultural primitivism that was influential on the rebellious youth movements of the 1960s and 70s is Norman O. Brown's Life Against Death (1959). Problem Play. A type of drama that was popularized by the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen. In problem plays, the situation faced by the protag\u00ad onist is put forward by the author as a representative instance of a contempo\u00ad rary social problem; often the dramatist manages\u2014by the use of a character who speaks for the author, or by the evolution of the plot, or both\u2014to pro\u00ad pose a solution to the problem which is at odds with prevailing opinion. The issue may be the drastically inadequate autonomy, scope, and dignity allotted to women in the middle-class nineteenth-century family (Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House, 1879); or the morality of prostitution, regarded as a typical prod\u00ad uct of the economic arrangements in a capitalist society (George Bernard Shaw's Mrs. Warren's Profession, 1898); or the crisis in racial and ethnic rela\u00ad tions in present-day America (in numerous current dramas and films). Com\u00ad pare social novel. A subtype of the modern problem play is the discussion play, in which the social issue is not incorporated into a plot but expounded in the give and take of a sustained debate among the characters. See Shaw's Getting Married, and Act III of his Man and Superman; also his book on Ibsen's plays, The Quin\u00ad tessence oflbsenism (1891). In a specialized application, the term problem plays is sometimes ap\u00ad plied to a group of Shakespeare's plays, also called \"bitter comedies\"\u2014es\u00ad pecially Troilus and Cressida, Measure for Measure, and All's Well That Ends Well\u2014which explore ignoble aspects of human nature, and in which the reso\u00ad lution of the plot seems to many readers to be problematic, in that it does not settle or solve, except superficially, the moral problems raised in the play. By extension, the term came to be applied also to other Shakespearean plays which explore the dark side of human nature, or which seem to leave unre\u00ad solved the issues that arise in the course of the action. See A. P. Rossiter, \"The Problem Plays,\" in Shakespeare: Modern Essays in Criticism, ed. Leonard F. Dean (rev., 1967). Prose is an inclusive term for all discourse, spoken or written, which is not patterned into the lines either of metric verse or of free verse. (See meter.) It is possible to discriminate a great variety of nonmetric types of language, which PROSODY \u00b7 PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM 247 can be placed along a spectrum according to the degree to which they exploit, and make prominent, modes of formal organization. At one end is the irregu\u00ad lar, and only occasionally formal, prose of ordinary discourse. Distinguished written discourse, in what John Dryden called \"that other harmony of prose,\" is no less an art than distinguished verse; in all literatures, in fact, artfully written prose seems to have developed later than written verse. As written prose gets more \"literary\"\u2014whether its function is descriptive, expository, narrative, or expressive\u2014it exhibits more patent, though highly diverse, modes of rhythm and other formal features. The prose translations of the po\u00ad etic books of the Old Testament in the King James Bible, for example, have a repetition, balance, and contrast of clauses which approximate the form that in the nineteenth century was named \"the prose poem.\" Prose poems are densely compact, pronouncedly rhythmic, and highly sonorous composi\u00ad tions which are written as a continuous sequence of sentences without line breaks. Examples of prose poems are, in French, Charles Baudelaire's Little Poems in Prose (1869) and Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations and in En\u00ad glish, excerptible passages in Walter Pater's prose essays, such as his famous meditation on Leonardo da Vinci's painting the Mona Lisa, in The Renaissance (1873). John Ashberry's Three Poems (1972) are prose poems, in that they are printed continuously, without broken lines. Farther still along the formal spectrum, we leave the domain of prose, by the use of line breaks and the con\u00ad trolled rhythms, pauses, syntactical suspensions, and cadences that identify free verse. At the far end of the spectrum we get the regular, recurrent units of weaker and stronger stressed syllables that constitute the meters of English verse. See style (including the list of readings), and for a special form of elabo\u00ad rately formal prose, euphuism. Refer to George Saintsbury, A History of English Prose Rhythm (1912); M. Boulton, Anatomy of Prose (1954); George L. Trager and Henry Lee Smith, Jr., An Outline of English Structure (1951); Robert Adolphe, The Rise of Modern Prose Style (1968). E. D. Hirsch discusses the de\u00ad velopment of English prose in The Philosophy of Composition (1977), pp. 51-72. On the prose poem, see Jonathan Monroe, A Poverty of Objects: The Prose Poem and the Politics of Genre (1987). Prosody signifies the systematic study of versification in poetry; that is, a study of the principles and practice of meter, rhyme, and stanza forms. Some\u00ad times the term \"prosody\" is extended to include also the study of speech- sound patterns and effects such as alliteration, assonance, euphony, and onomatopoeia. Psychological and Psychoanalytic Criticism. Psychological criticism deals with a work of literature primarily as an expression, in fictional form, of the state of mind and the structure of personality of the individual author. This approach emerged in the early decades of the nineteenth century, as part of the romantic replacement of earlier mimetic and pragmatic views by an ex\u00ad pressive view of the nature of literature; see criticism. By 1827 Thomas Carlyle 248 PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM could say that the usual question \"with the best of our own critics at present\" is one \"mainly of a psychological sort, to be answered by discovering and de\u00ad lineating the peculiar nature of the poet from his poetry.\" During the Roman\u00ad tic Period, we find widely practiced all three variants of the critical procedures (still current today) that are based on the assumption that a work of literature is correlated with its author's distinctive mental and emotional traits: (1) ref\u00ad erence to the author's personality in order to explain and interpret a literary work; (2) reference to literary works in order to establish, biographically, the personality of the author; and (3) the mode of reading a literary work specifi\u00ad cally in order to experience the distinctive subjectivity, or consciousness, of its author (see critics of consciousness). We even find that John Keble, in the se\u00ad ries of Latin lectures On the Healing Power of Poetry\u2014published in 1844, but delivered more than ten years earlier\u2014proposed a thoroughgoing proto- Freudian literary theory. \"Poetry,\" Keble claimed, \"is the indirect expression ... of some overpowering emotion, or ruling taste, or feeling, the direct indul\u00ad gence whereof is somehow repressed\"; this repression is imposed by the au\u00ad thor's sentiments of \"reticence\" and \"shame\"; the conflict between the need for expression and the compulsion to repress such self-revelation is resolved by the poet's ability to give \"healing relief to secret mental emotion, yet with\u00ad out detriment to modest reserve\" by a literary \"art which under certain veils and disguises .. . reveals the fervent emotions of the mind\"; and this dis\u00ad guised mode of self-expression serves as \"a safety valve, preserving men from madness.\" (The emergence and the varieties of romantic psychological criti\u00ad cism are described in M. H. Abrams, The Minor and the Lamp, 1953, chapters 6 and 9.) In the present era many critics make at least passing references to the psychology of an author in discussing works of literature, with the notable ex\u00ad ception of those whose critical premises invalidate such reference; mainly for\u00ad malism, New Criticism, structuralism, deconstruction. Since the 1920s, a very widespread form of psychological literary criticism has come to be psychoanalytic criticism, whose premises and procedures were established by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). Freud had developed the dy\u00ad namic form of psychology that he called psychoanalysis as a means of analysis and therapy for neuroses, but soon expanded it to account for many develop\u00ad ments and practices in the history of civilization, including warfare, mythol\u00ad ogy, and religion, as well as literature and the other arts. Freud's brief comment on the workings of the artist's imagination at the end of the twenty-third lec\u00ad ture of his Introduction to Psychoanalysis (1920), supplemented by relevant pas\u00ad sages in the other lectures in that book, set forth the theoretical framework of what is sometimes called \"classical\" psychoanalytic criticism: Literature and the other arts, like dreams and neurotic symptoms, consist of the imagined, or fantasied, fulfillment of wishes that are either denied by reality or are prohib\u00ad ited by the social standards of morality and propriety. The forbidden, mainly sexual (\"libidinal\") wishes come into conflict with, and are repressed by, the \"censor\" (the internalized representative within each individual of the stan\u00ad dards of society) into the unconscious realm of the artist's mind, but are per\u00ad mitted by the censor to achieve a fantasied satisfaction in distorted forms PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM 249 which serve to disguise their real motives and objects from the conscious mind. The chief mechanisms that effect these disguises of unconscious wishes are (1) \"condensation\" (the omission of parts of the unconscious material and the fusion of several unconscious elements into a single entity); (2) \"displace\u00ad ment\" (the substitution for an unconscious object of desire by one that is ac\u00ad ceptable to the conscious mind); and (3) \"symbolism\" (the representation of repressed, mainly sexual, objects of desire by nonsexual objects which resem\u00ad ble them or are associated with them in prior experience). The disguised fan\u00ad tasies that are evident to consciousness are called by Freud the \"manifest\" content of a dream or work of literature; the unconscious wishes that find a semblance of satisfaction in this distorted form he calls the \"latent\" content. Also present in the unconscious of every individual, according to Freud, are residual traces of prior stages of psychosexual development, from earliest infancy onward, which have been outgrown, but remain as \"fixations\" in the unconscious of the adult. When triggered by some later event in adult life, a repressed wish is revived and motivates a fantasy, in disguised form, of a satis\u00ad faction that is modeled on the way that the wish had been gratified in infancy or early childhood. The chief enterprise of the psychoanalytic critic, in a way that parallels the enterprise of the psychoanalyst as a therapist, is to reveal the true content, and thereby to explain the effect on the reader, of a literary work by translating its manifest elements into the latent, unconscious determi\u00ad nants that constitute their suppressed meanings. Freud also asserts, however, that artists possess special abilities that differ\u00ad entiate them radically from the patently neurotic personality. The artistic person, for example, possesses to an especially high degree the power to sub\u00ad limate (that is, to shift the instinctual drives from their original sexual goals to nonsexual \"higher\" goals, including the discipline of becoming proficient as an artist); the ability to elaborate fantasied wish-fulfillments into the man\u00ad ifest features of a work of art in a way that conceals or deletes their merely personal elements, and so makes them capable of satisfying the unconscious desires of people other than the individual artist; and the \"puzzling\" ability\u2014 which Freud elsewhere says is a power of \"genius\" that psychoanalysis cannot explain\u2014to mold the artistic medium into \"a faithful image of the creatures of his imagination,\" as well as into a satisfying artistic form. The result is a fantasied wish-fulfillment of a complex and artfully shaped sort that not only allows the artist to overcome, at least partially and temporarily, personal con\u00ad flicts and repressions, but also makes it possible for the artist's audience \"to obtain solace and consolation from their own unconscious sources of gratifi\u00ad cation which had become inaccessible\" to them. Literature and art, therefore, unlike dreams and neuroses, may serve the artist as a mode of fantasy that opens \"the way back to reality.\" This outline of his theory of art in 1920 was elaborated and refined, but not radically altered, by the later developments in Freud's theory of mental struc\u00ad tures, dynamics, and processes. Prominent among these developments was Freud's model of the mind as having three functional aspects: the id (which in\u00ad corporates libidinal and other desires), the superego (the internalization of 250 PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM standards of morality and propriety), and the ego (which tries as best it can to negotiate the conflicts between the insatiable demands of the id, the impossibly stringent requirements of the superego, and the limited possibilities of gratifica\u00ad tion offered by the world of \"reality\"). Freud has himself summarized for a gen\u00ad eral audience his later theoretical innovations, with his remarkable power for clear and dramatic exposition, in New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1933) and An Outline of Psychoanalysis (1939). Freud asserted that many of his views had been anticipated by insightful authors in Western literature, and he himself applied psychoanalysis to brief discussions of the latent content in the manifest characters or events of liter\u00ad ary works including Shakespeare's Hamlet, Macbeth, A Midsummer Night's Dream, and King Lear. He also wrote a brilliant analysis of Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov and a full-length study, Delusion and Dream (1917), of the novel Gradiva by the Danish writer Wilhelm Jensen. Especially after the 1930s, a number of writers produced critical analyses, modeled on classical Freudian theory, of the lives of authors and of the content of their literary works. One of the best-known books in this mode is Hamlet and Oedipus (1949) by the psychoanalyst Ernest Jones. Building on earlier suggestions by Freud himself, Jones explained Hamlet's inability to make up his mind to kill his uncle by reference to his Oedipus complex\u2014that is, the repressed but continuing presence in the adult's unconscious of the male infant's desire to possess his mother and to have his rival, the father, out of the way. (Freud de\u00ad rived the term from Sophocles' Greek tragedy Oedipus the King, whose protag\u00ad onist has unknowingly killed his father and married his mother.) Jones proposes that Hamlet's conflict is \"an echo of a similar one in Shakespeare himself,\" and goes on to account for the audience's powerful and continued response to the play, over many centuries, as a result of the repressed Oedipal conflict that is shared by all men. In more recent decades there has been in\u00ad creasing emphasis by Freudian critics, in a mode suggested by Freud's later writings, on the role of \"ego psychology\" in elaborating the manifest content and artistic form of a work of literature; that is, on the way that the \"ego,\" in contriving the work, consciously manages to mediate between the conflicting demands of the id, the superego, and the limits imposed by reality. On such developments see Frederic C. Crews, \"Literature and Psychology,\" in Relations of Literary Study, ed. James Thorpe (1967), and the issue on \"Psychology and Literature: Some Contemporary Directions,\" in New Literary History 12 (1980). Norman Holland is a leading exponent of the application of psychoanalytic concepts not (as in most earlier criticism) to the relation of the author to the work, but to the relation of the reader to the work, explaining each reader's individual response as the product of a \"transactive\" engagement between his or her unconscious desires and defenses and the fantasies that the author has projected in the literary text; see under reader-response criticism. The term psychobiography designates an account of the life of an author (see biography) that focuses on the subject's psychological development, rely\u00ad ing for evidence both on external sources and on the author's own writings. It stresses the role of unconscious and disguised motives in forming the author's PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM personality, and is usually written in accordance with a version, or a revision, of the Freudian theory of the stages of psychosexual development. A major ex\u00ad emplar of the mode was Erik H. Erikson's Young Man Luther (1958), in which Erikson stressed the importance of Luther's adolescent \"identity crisis.\" Other notable instances of literary psychobiography are Leon Edel, Henry fames (5 vols., 1953-72), and Kaplan, Mark Twain and His World (1974). Promi\u00ad nent and diverse examples of Freudian literary criticism are in the collections listed below. It should be noted, in addition, that many modern literary critics, like many modern authors, owe some debt to Freud; such major critics, for ex\u00ad ample, as Kenneth Burke, Edmund Wilson, and Lionel Trilling assimilated cen\u00ad tral Freudian concepts into their overall critical views and procedures. Carl G. Jung is sometimes called a psychoanalyst, but although he began as a disciple of Freud, his mature version of depth-psychology is very different from that of his predecessor, and what we call Jungian criticism of literature departs radically from psychoanalytic criticism. Jung's emphasis is not on the individual unconscious, but on what he calls the \"collective unconscious,\" shared by all individuals in all cultures, which he regards as the repository of \"racial memories\" and of primordial images and patterns of experience that he calls archetypes. He does not, like Freud, view literature as a disguised form of li\u00ad bidinal wish-fulfillment that to a large extent parallels the fantasies of a neu\u00ad rotic personality. Instead, Jung regards great literature as, like the myths whose patterns recur in diverse cultures, an expression of the archetypes of the collec\u00ad tive unconscious. A great author possesses, and provides for readers, access to the archetypal images buried in the racial memory, and so succeeds in revitaliz\u00ad ing aspects of the psyche which are essential both to individual self-integration and to the mental and emotional well-being of the human race. Jung's theory of literature has been a cardinal formative influence on archetypal criticism and myth criticism. See Jung, Contributions to Analytic Psychology (1928) and Modern Man in Search of a Soul (1933); also Edward Glover, Freud or Jung (1950). Since the development of structural and poststructural theories, there has been a strong revival of Freud, although in diverse reformulations of the clas\u00ad sical Freudian scheme. Close attention to Freud's writings, and frequently the assimilation of some version of Freud's ideas to their own views and proce\u00ad dures, are features of the criticism of many current writers, whether they are Marxist, Foucauldian, or Derridean in theoretical commitment or primary focus. Harold Bloom's view of the anxiety of influence specifically adapts to the composition and reading of poetry Freud's concepts of the Oedipus complex and of the distorting operation of defense mechanisms in dreams. A number of feminist critics have attacked the male-centered nature of Freud's theory\u2014 especially evident in such crucial conceptions as the Oedipus complex and \"penis envy\" on the part of the female child; but many feminists have also adapted a revised version of Freudian concepts and mental mechanisms to their analyses of the writing and reading of literary texts. See Juliet Mitchell, Psychoanalysis and Feminism (1975); Mary Jacobus, Reading Woman (1986); Nancy Chodorow, Feminism and Theory (1990); Rosalind Min- sky, ed., Psychoanalysis and Gender: An Introductory Reader (1996). 252 PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOANALYTIC CRITICISM Jacques Lacan, \"the French Freud,\" developed a semiotic version of Freud, converting the basic concepts of psychoanalysis into formulations derived from the linguistic theory of Ferdinand de Saussure, and applying these con\u00ad cepts not to human individuals, but to the operations of the process of signi\u00ad fication. (See under linguistics in literary criticism.) Typical is Lacan's oft-quoted dictum, \"The unconscious is structured like a language.\" His procedure is to recast Freud's key concepts and mechanisms into the linguistic mode, viewing the human mind not as pre-existent to, but as constituted by the language we use. Especially important in Lacanian literary criticism is Lacan's reformula\u00ad tion of Freud's concepts of the early stages of psychosexual development and the formation of the Oedipus complex into the distinction between a pre- linguistic stage of development that he calls the imaginary and the stage after the acquisition of language that he calls the symbolic. In the imaginary stage, there is no clear distinction between the subject and an object, or be\u00ad tween the self and other selves. Intervenient between these two stages is what Lacan calls the mirror stage, the moment when the infant learns to identify with his or her image in a mirror, and so begins to develop a sense of a sepa\u00ad rate self that is later enhanced by what is reflected back to it from encounters with other people. When it enters the symbolic stage, the infant subject as\u00ad similates the inherited system of linguistic differences, hence is constituted by the symbolic, as it learns to accept its pre-determined \"position\" in such sym\u00ad bolic realm of language, in Lacan's theory, is the realm of the law of the father, in which the \"phallus\" (in a symbolic sense) is \"the privileged sig\u00ad nifier\" that serves to establish the mode for all other signifiers. In a parallel fashion, Lacan translates Freud's views of the mental workings of dream- formation into textual terms of the play of signifiers, converting Freud's dis\u00ad torting defense-mechanisms into linguistic figures of speech. And according to Lacan, all processes of linguistic expression and interpretation, driven by \"desire\" for a lost and unachievable object, move incessantly along a chain of unstable signifiers, without any possibility of coming to rest on a fixed signi\u00ad fied, or presence. (See Jacques Lacan, Ecrits: A Selection, 1977; Lacan's much discussed reading of Edgar Allan Poe's short story The Purloined Letter as an al\u00ad legory of the workings of the signifier, in Yale French Studies, Vol. 48, 1972; and Malcolm Bowie, Lacan, 1991.) Lacan's notions of the inalienable split, or \"difference,\" that inhabits the self, and of the endless chain of displacements in the quest for meaning, has made him a prominent reference in poststruc\u00ad tural theorists. And his distinction between the pre-Oedipal, maternal stage of the pre-linguistic imaginary and the \"phallocentric\" stage of symbolic lan\u00ad guage has been exploited at length by a number of French feminists; see He\u00ad lene Cixous, Luce Irigaray, and Julia Kristeva under feminist criticism. Many of Freud's psychoanalytic writings on literature and the arts have been collected by Benjamin Nelson, ed., Sigmund Freud on Creativity and the Un\u00ad conscious (1958). Anthologies of psychoanalytic criticism by various authors are William Phillips, ed., Art and Psychoanalysis (1957), and Leonard and Eleanor Manheim, eds., Hidden Patterns: Studies in Psychoanalytic Literary Criticism PUN \u00b7 PURPLE PATCH 253 (1966). Useful discussions and developments of Freudian literary theory are Frederick J. Hoffman, Freudianism and the Literary Mind (rev., 1957), which also describes Freud's wide influence on writers and critics; Norman N. Holland, Holland's Guide to Psychoanalytic Psychology and Literature-and-Psychology (1990); and Peter Brooks, Psychoanalysis and Storytelling (1994). Elizabeth Wright, Psy\u00ad choanalytic Criticism: Theory in Practice (1984), reviews various recent develop\u00ad ments in psychoanalytic theories and their applications to literary criticism. For two major traditional critics who have to an important extent adapted Freudian concepts to their general enterprise, see Edmund Wilson, The Wound and the Bow (1941), and Lionel Trilling, \"Freud and Literature,\" in The Liberal Imagina\u00ad tion (1950). Frederic C. Crews, who in 1966 wrote an exemplary Freudian criti\u00ad cal study, The Sins of the Fathers: Hawthorne's Psychological Themes, later retracted his Freudian commitment; see his Skeptical Engagements (1986). For feminist views and adaptations of Jacques Lacan, see Jane Gallop, Reading Lacan (1985), Shoshana Felman, Jacques Lacan and the Adventure of Insight (1987); and Eliza\u00ad beth Grosz, Jacques Lacan: A Feminist Introduction (1990). Pun. A play on words that are either identical in sound (homonyms) or very similar in sound, but are sharply diverse in meaning; an example is the last word in the title of Oscar Wilde's comedy, The Importance of Being Earnest (1895). Puns have often had serious literary uses. The authority of the Pope in Roman Catholicism goes back to the Greek pun uttered by Christ in Matthew 16:18, \"Thou art Peter [Petros] and upon this rock [petra] I will build my church.\" Shakespeare and other writers used puns seriously as well as for comic purposes. In Romeo and Juliet (III. i. 101) Mercurio, bleeding to death, says grimly, \"Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man\"; and John Donne's solemn \"Hymn to God the Father\" (1633) puns throughout on his own name and the past participle \"done.\" Milton was an inveterate in\u00ad ventor of serious puns in Paradise Lost. In the eighteenth century and there\u00ad after, however, the literary use of the pun has been almost exclusively comic. A major exception is James Joyce's Finnegans Wake (1939), which exploits puns throughout in order to help sustain its complex effect, at once serious and comic, of multiple levels of meaning; see portmanteau word. A special type of pun, known as the equivoque, is the use of a single word or phrase which has two disparate meanings, in a context which makes both meanings equally relevant. An example is the couplet in a song from Shakespeare's Cymbeline: \"Golden lads and girls all must, / As chimney sweep\u00ad ers, come to dust.\" An epitaph suggested for a bank teller consists of a series of equivocal phrases: He checked his cash, cashed in his checks, And left his window. Who is next? Purple Patch. A translation of Horace's Latin phrase \"purpureus ... pan- nus\" in his versified Ars Poetica (first century B.C.). It signifies a marked height\u00ad ening of style in rhythm, diction, repetitions, and figurative language that makes a passage of verse or prose\u2014especially a descriptive passage\u2014stand out 254 QUEER THEORY from its context. The term is sometimes applied without derogation to a set piece, separable and quotable, in which an author rises to an occasion. An ex\u00ad ample is the eulogy of England by the dying John of Gaunt in Shakespeare's Richard II (II. i. 40 ff.), beginning: This royal throne of kings, this scept'red isle, This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, This other Eden, demi-paradise.. .. Other well-known examples are Lord Byron's depiction of the Duchess of Richmond's ball on the eve of Waterloo in Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto III, xxi-xxviii (1816), and Walter Pater's prose description of the Mona Lisa in his essay on Leonardo da Vinci in The Renaissance (1873). Usually, however, \"purple passage\" connotes disparagement, implying that one has self\u00ad consciously girded oneself to perform a piece of fine writing. In Stella Gibbons' satiric novel, Cold Comfort Farm, the narrator is proud of her purple descriptive passages, and follows the example of Baedeker's guide-books by marking them with varying numbers of asterisks: \"Dawn crept over the Downs like a sinister white animal, followed by the snarling cries of the wind eating its way between the black boughs of the thorns.\" Queer Theory is often used to designate the combined area of gay and les\u00ad bian studies and criticism, as well as theoretical and critical writings concern\u00ad ing all modes of variance (such as cross-dressing) from the normative model of biological sex, gender identity, and sexual desires. The term \"queer\" was originally derogatory, used to stigmatize male and female same-sex love as de\u00ad viant and unnatural; since the early 1990s, however, it has been increasingly adopted by gays and lesbians themselves as a non-invidious term to identify a way of life and an area for scholarly inquiry. (See Teresa de Laurentis, Queer Theory: Theory: An Introduction, 1996.) Both lesbian studies and gay studies began as \"liberation move\u00ad ments\"\u2014in parallel with the movements for African-American and feminist liberation\u2014during the anti-Vietnam War, anti-establishment, and counter- cultural ferment of the late 1960s and 1970s. Since that time these studies have maintained a relation to the political activities to achieve, for gays and lesbians, political, legal, and economic rights equal to those of the heterosex\u00ad ual majority. Through the 1970s, the two movements were primarily sepa\u00ad ratist: gays often thought of themselves as quintessentially male, while many lesbians, aligning themselves with the feminist movement, characterized the gay movement as sharing the anti-female attitudes of the reigning patriarchal culture. Recently, however, there has been a growing recognition (signalized by the adoption of the joint term \"queer\") of the degree to which the two groups share a history as a despised and suppressed minority and possess common political and social goals. In the 1970s, researchers for the most part assumed that there was a fixed, unitary identity as a gay man or as a lesbian that has remained stable QUEER THEORY through human history. A major endeavor was to identify and reclaim the works of non-heterosexual writers from Plato to Walt Whitman, Proust, Gide, Auden, and James Baldwin, and from the Sappho of Lesbos to Vir\u00ad ginia Woolf, Adrienne Rich, and Lorde. The list included writers (Shakespeare and Christina Rossetti are examples) who represented homo- erotic subject matter, but whose own sexuality the available biographical evi\u00ad dence leaves uncertain. (See Claude J. Summers, The Gay and Lesbian Literary Heritage: A Reader's Companion to the Writers and Their Works, from Antiquity to the Present, 1995.) In the 1980s and 1990s, however\u2014in large part because of the assimilation of the viewpoints and analytic methods of Derrida, Foucault, and other poststructuralists\u2014the earlier assumptions about a unitary and sta\u00ad ble gay or lesbian identity were frequently put to question, and historical and critical analyses became increasingly subtle and complex. A number of queer theorists, for example, adopted the deconstructive mode of dismantling the key binary oppositions of Western culture, such as male/female, heterosexual/homosexual, and natural/unnatural, by which a spectrum of diverse things are forced into only two categories, and in which the first category is assigned privilege, power, and centrality, while the second is derogated, subordinated, and marginalized. (See under deconstruction.) In an important essay of 1980, \"Compulsive Heterosexuality and Lesbian Exis\u00ad called the \"lesbian continuum\" as a way of stressing how far-ranging and diverse is the spectrum of love and bonding among women, including female friendship, the family relationship between mother and daughter, and women's partnerships and social groups, as well as overtly physical same-sex relations. Later theorists such as Eve Sedg\u00ad wick and Judith Butler inverted the standard hierarchical opposition by which homosexuality is marginalized and made unnatural, by stressing the extent to which the ostensible normativity of heterosexuality is based on the suppression and denial of same-sex desires and relationships. Another prominent theoretical procedure has been to undo the earlier as\u00ad sumption that heterosexual and homosexual are essential, universal, and transhistorical types of human subjects, or identities, by historicizing these categories\u2014that is, by proposing that they are social and discursive \"con\u00ad structs\" that emerged under special ideological conditions in a particular cul\u00ad ture at a particular time. (See under new historicism.) A central text is the first volume of Michel Foucault's History of Sexuality (1976), which claims that, while there had long been a social category of sodomy as a transgressive human act, the \"homosexual,\" as a special type of human subject or identity, was a construction of the medical and legal discourse of the latter nineteenth century. In a further development of constructionist theory, Judith Butler, in Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (1990), described the categories of gender and of sexuality as performative, in the sense that the features which a cultural discourse institutes as masculine or feminine, het\u00ad erosexual or homosexual, it also makes happen, by establishing an identity that the socialized individual assimilates and the patterns of behavior that he or she enacts. Homosexuality, by this view, is not a particular identity that 256 READER-RESPONSE CRITICISM effects a pattern of action, but a socially pre-established pattern of action that produces the effect of originating in a particular identity. (For such poststruc- turalist extensions of John Austin's concept of \"the performative,\" see speech- act theory.) In recent writings, the constructionist view has been elaborated by con\u00ad sidering the cross-influences of race and of economic class in producing the identities and modes of behavior of gender and sexuality. (See, e.g., Barbara Smith, \"Toward a Black Feminist Criticism,\" 1977, reprinted in Within the Cir\u00ad cle: An Anthology of African-American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renais\u00ad sance to the Present, ed. Angelyn Mitchell, 1994; and Ann Allen Stickley, \"The Black Lesbian in American Literature: An Overview,\" in Conditions: Five 2, 1979.) Sustained debate among queer theorists concerns the risk of a radical constructionism, which would dissolve a lesbian or gay identity into a purely discursive product, as against the need to affirm a special and enduring iden\u00ad tity in order to signalize and celebrate it, and to establish a base for concerted political action. A number of journals are now devoted to queer theory and to lesbian and gay studies and criticism; the field has also become the subject of regularly scheduled learned conferences, and has been established in the curriculum of the humanities and social sciences in a great many colleges and universities. Anthologies: Karla Jay and Joanne Glasgow, eds., Lesbian Texts and Contexts: Radical Revisions (1990); Diana Fuss, ed., M. Halperin, eds., The Lesbian and Gay Studies Reader (1993), which includes selections by almost all the theorists and critics mentioned in this entry. There is a large and rapidly growing body of books on these subjects.

See also under feminist criticism. Reader-Response Criticism does not designate any one critical theory, but a focus on the process of reading a literary text that is shared by many of the critical modes, American and European, which have come into promi\u00ad nence since the 1960s. Reader-response critics turn from the traditional con\u00ad ception of a work as an achieved structure of meanings to the ongoing mental operations and responses of readers as their eyes follow a text on the page be\u00ad fore them. In the more drastic forms of such reader-response criticism, mat\u00ad ters that had been considered by critics to be features of the work itself (including narrator, plot, characters, style, and structure, as well as meanings) are dissolved into an evolving process, consisting primarily of diverse kinds of expectations and the violations, deferments, satisfactions, and restructurings of expectations, in the flow of a reader's experience. Reader-response critics of READER-RESPONSE CRITICISM 257 all theoretical persuasions agree that, at least to some considerable degree, the meanings of a text are the \"production\" or \"creation\" of the individual reader, hence that there is no one \"correct\" meaning for all readers either of the lin\u00ad guistic parts or of the artistic whole of a text. Where these critics importantly differ is (1) in their view of the primary factors that shape a reader's responses; (2) in the place at which they draw the line between what is \"objectively\" given in a text and the \"subjective\" responses of an individual reader; and as a result of this difference, (3) in their conclusion about the extent, if any, to which a text controls, or at least \"constrains,\" a reader's responses, so as to au\u00ad thorize us to reject at least some readings as misreadings, even if, as almost all reader-response critics assert, we are unable to demonstrate that any one read\u00ad ing is the correct reading. The following is a brief survey of some of the more prominent forms of reader-response criticism: The contemporary German critic Wolfgang Iser develops the phenome- nological analysis of the reading process proposed by Roman Ingarden, but whereas Ingarden had limited himself to a description of reading in general, Iser applies his theory to the analysis of many individual works of literature, especially prose fiction. (For Ingarden, see phenomenology and criticism.) In Iser's view the literary text, as a product of the writer's intentional acts, in part controls the reader's responses, but always contains (to a degree that has greatly increased in many modern literary texts) a number of \"gaps\" or \"inde\u00ad terminate elements.\" These the reader must fill in by a creative participation with what is given in the text before him. The experience of reading is an evolving process of anticipation, frustration, retrospection, reconstruction, and satisfaction. Iser distinguishes between the implied reader, who is estab\u00ad lished by the text itself as one who is expected to respond in specific ways to the \"response-inviting structures\" of the text, and the \"actual reader,\" whose responses are inevitably colored by his or her accumulated private experi\u00ad ences. In both cases, however, the process of the reader's consciousness con\u00ad stitutes both the partial patterns (which we ordinarily attribute to objective features of the work itself) and the coherence, or unity, of the work as a whole. As a consequence, literary texts always permit a range of possible meanings. The fact, however, that the author's intentional acts establish lim\u00ad its, as well as incentives, to the reader's creative additions to a text allows us to reject some readings as misreadings. (For an application of phenomenological analysis to the history of ever-altering reader-responses to a given text, see reception-theory.) French structuralist criticism, as Jonathan Culler has said in Structuralist Po\u00ad etics (1975), \"is essentially a theory of reading\" which aims to \"specify how we go about making sense of texts\" (pp. viii, 128). As practiced by critics such as Culler in the course of his book, such criticism stresses literary conventions, codes, and rules which, having been assimilated by competent readers, serve to structure their reading experience and so make possible, at the same time as they impose constraints on, the partially creative activity of interpretation. The structuralist Roland Barthes, however, in his later theory encouraged a 258 READER-RESPONSE CRITICISM mode of reading that opens the text to an endless play of alternative mean\u00ad ings. And the poststructuralist movement of deconstruction is a theory of read\u00ad ing that subverts the structuralist view that interpretation is in some part controlled by linguistic and literary codes, and instead proposes a \"creative\" reading of any text as a play of \"differences\" that generate innumerable and mutually contradictory, but \"undecidable\" meanings. American proponents of reader-response types of interpretive theory often begin by rejecting the claim of the American New Criticism that a liter\u00ad ary work is a self-sufficient object invested with publicly available meanings, whose internal features and structure should be analyzed without \"external\" reference to the responses of its readers (see affective fallacy). In radical oppo\u00ad sition to this view, these newer critics turn their attention exclusively to the reader's responses; they differ greatly, however, in the factors to which they attribute the formation of these responses. David Bleich, in Subjective Criticism (1978), undertakes to show, on the basis of classroom experiments, that any purportedly \"objective\" reading of a text, if it is more than an empty derivation from theoretical formulas, turns out to be based on a response that is not determined by the text, but is instead a \"subjective process\" determined by the distinctive personality of the indi\u00ad vidual reader. In an alternative psychoanalytic analysis of reading, Norman Holland accounts for the responses of a reader to a text by recourse to Freudian concepts (see psychoanalytic criticism). The subject matter of a work of literature is a projection of the fantasies\u2014engendered by the interplay of unconscious needs and defenses\u2014that constitute the particular \"identity\" of its author. The individual reader's \"subjective\" response to a text is a \"transac\u00ad tive\" encounter between the fantasies projected by its author and the particu\u00ad lar defenses, expectations, and wish-fulfilling fantasies that make up the reader's own identity. In this transactive process the reader transforms the fantasy content, \"which he has created from the materials of the story his de\u00ad fenses admitted,\" into a unity, or \"meaningful totality,\" which constitutes the reader's particular interpretation of the text. There is no universally determi\u00ad nate meaning of a work; two readers will agree in their interpretation only in\u00ad sofar as their \"identity themes\" are sufficiently alike to enable each to fit the other's re-creation of a text to his or her own distinctive responses. In his theory of reading, Harold Bloom also employs psychoanalytic con\u00ad cepts; in particular, he adapts Freud's concept of the mechanisms of defense against the revelation to consciousness of repressed desires to his own view of the process of reading as the application of \"defense mechanisms\" against the \"influence,\" or threat to the reader's imaginative autonomy, of the poet whose text is being read. Bloom applies Freudian concepts in a much more complex way than Holland; he arrives, however, at a parallel conclusion that there can be no determinate or correct meaning of a text. All \"reading is. . . misreading\"; the only difference is that between a \"strong\" misreading and a \"weak\" misreading. See anxiety of influence. Stanley Fish is the proponent of what he calls affective stylistics. In his earlier writings Fish represented the activity of reading as one that converts READER-RESPONSE CRITICISM 259 the spatial sequence of printed words on a page into a temporal flow of expe\u00ad rience in a reader who has acquired a \"literary competence.\" In following the printed text with his eye, the reader makes sense of what he has so far read by anticipating what is still to come. These anticipations may be fulfilled by what follows in the text; often, however, they will turn out to have been mis\u00ad taken. But since, according to Fish, \"the meaning of an utterance\" is the reader's \"experience\u2014all of it,\" and the reader's mistakes are the ex\u00ad perience provided by the author's language,\" these mistakes are an integral part of the meaning of a text. (See \"Literature in the Reader: Affective Stylis- tics,\" published in 1970 and reprinted with slight changes in Self-Consuming Artifacts: The Experience of Seventeenth Century Literature, 1974, and in Is There a Text in This Class? 1980.) Fish's analyses of large-scale literary works were de\u00ad signed to show a coherence in the kinds of mistakes, constitutive of specific types of meaning-experience, which are effected in the reader by the text of John Milton's Paradise Lost, and by various essayists and poets of the seven\u00ad teenth century. Fish's early claim was that he was describing a universal process of the competent reading of literary texts. In later publications, however, he intro\u00ad duced the concept of interpretive communities, each of which is composed of members who share a particular reading \"strategy,\" or \"set of community as\u00ad sumptions.\" Fish, in consequence, now presented his own affective stylistics as only one of many alternative modes of interpretation, which his earlier writ\u00ad ings were covertly attempting to persuade his readers to adopt. He also pro\u00ad posed that each communal strategy in effect \"creates\" all the seemingly objective features of the text itself, as well as the \"intentions, speakers, and au\u00ad thors\" that we may infer from the text. The result is that there can be no uni\u00ad versal \"right reading\" of any text; the validity of any reading, however obvious it may seem to a reader, will always depend on the assumptions and strategy of reading that he or she happens to share with other members of a particular in\u00ad terpretive community. Fish's claim is that all values, as well as meanings, of a text are relative to the concept or scheme of a particular interpretive commu\u00ad nity; furthermore, that such conceptual schemes are \"incommensurable,\" in that there is no standpoint, outside of any interpretive community, for trans\u00ad lating the discourse of one community into that of another, or for mediating between them. (See Fish, Is There a Text in This Class? The Authority of Interpre\u00ad tive Communities, 1980; and for a concise exposition of philosophical critiques of Fish's claims for interpretive relativism and incommensurability, James Bat- tersby, Reason and the Nature of Texts, 1996.) In a later book, Doing What Comes Naturally: Change, Rhetoric, and the Practice of Theory in Literary and Legal Studies (1989), Fish analyzes, and defends, the role of the professional \"interpretive community\" of academic critics in literary studies; he also extends his views of literary interpretation into the domain of legal interpretation. Since the early 1980s, as part of a widespread tendency to stress cultural and political factors in the study of literature, reader-response critics have in\u00ad creasingly undertaken to \"situate\" a particular reading of a text in its histori\u00ad cal setting, in the attempt to show the extent to which the responses that 260 REALISM AND NATURALISM constitute both the interpretation and evaluation of literature have been de\u00ad termined by a reader's ideology and by built-in biases about race, class, or gen\u00ad der.

Rabinowitz, Before Reading: Nanative Conventions and the Politics of Interpretation, 1987; and for feminist emphasis on the male biases that affect the responses of readers, Judith Fetterley, The Resisting Reader (1978); and Elizabeth A.

Abrams, \"How to Do Things with Texts,\" in Doing Things with Texts (1989). Realism and Naturalism. Realism is applied by literary critics in two di\u00ad verse ways: (1) to identify a movement in the writing of novels during the nineteenth century that included Honor\u00e9 de Balzac in France, George Eliot in England, and William Dean Howells in America (see realistic novel, under novel), and (2) to designate a recurrent mode, in various eras and literary forms, of representing human life and experience in literature. Realistic fiction is often opposed to romantic fiction. The romance is said to present life as we would have it be\u2014more picturesque, fantastic, adventur\u00ad ous, or heroic than actuality; realism, on the other hand, is said to represent life as it really is. This distinction in terms solely of subject matter, while rele\u00ad vant, is clearly inadequate. Casanova, T. E. Lawrence, and Winston Churchill were people in real life, but their biographies demonstrate that truth can be stranger than literary realism. It is more useful to identify realism in terms of the effect on the reader: realistic fiction is written to give the effect that it rep\u00ad resents life and the social world as it seems to the common reader, evoking the sense that its characters might in fact exist, and that such things might well happen. To achieve such effects, the novelists we identify as realists may or may not be selective in subject matter\u2014although most of them prefer the REALISM AND NATURALISM commonplace and the everyday, represented in minute detail, over rarer as\u00ad pects of life\u2014but they must render their materials in ways that make them seem to their readers the very stuff of ordinary experience. For example, Daniel Defoe in the early eighteenth century dealt with the extraordinary ad\u00ad ventures of a shipwrecked mariner named Robinson Crusoe and with the ex\u00ad traordinary misadventures of a woman named Moll Flanders; but he made his novels seem to readers a mirror held up to reality by his reportorial manner of rendering all the events, whether ordinary or extraordinary, in the same cir\u00ad cumstantial, matter-of-fact, and seemingly unselective way. Both the fictions of Franz Kafka and the present-day novels of magic realism achieve their ef\u00ad fects in large part by exploiting a realistic manner in rendering events that are in themselves fantastic, absurd, or flatly impossible. Russian formalists, followed more systematically by structuralist critics, proposed that both the selection of subject matter and the techniques of ren\u00ad dering in a realistic novel depend on their accordance with literary convention and codes which the reader has learned to interpret, or naturalize, in a way that makes the text seem a reflection of everyday reality. (See Roland Barthes, \"The Reality Effect,\" in French Literary Theory Today, ed. Tzvetan Todorov, 1982, and Jonathan Culler, Structuralist Poetics, 1975, chapter 7, \"Convention and Natu\u00ad ralization.\") Some theorists draw the conclusion that, since all literary repre\u00ad sentations are constituted by arbitrary conventions, there is no valid ground for holding any one kind of fiction to be more realistic than any other. It is a matter of common experience, however, that some novels indeed produce on the reader the effect of representing the ordinary course of events. Skepticism about the possibility of fictional realism is not an empirical doctrine which is based on the widespread experience of readers of literature, but a metaphysi\u00ad cal doctrine that denies the existence of any objective reality that is inde\u00ad pendent of altering human conventions and cultural formations. (For philosophical discussions of conventionality and reality, see the essays by Hilary Putnam, Nelson Goodman, and Menachem Brinker in New Literary His\u00ad tory, Vol. 13, 1981, and Vol. 14, 1983.) Naturalism is sometimes claimed to give an even more accurate depic\u00ad tion of life than realism. But naturalism is not only, like realism, a special se\u00ad lection of subject matter and a special way of rendering those materials; it is a mode of fiction that was developed by a school of writers in accordance with a particular philosophical thesis. This thesis, a product of post-Darwinian bi\u00ad ology in the nineteenth century, held that a human being exists entirely in the order of nature and does not have a soul nor any mode of participating in a religious or spiritual world beyond the natural world; and therefore, that such a being is merely a higher-order animal whose character and behavior are entirely determined by two kinds of forces, heredity and environment. A person inherits compulsive instincts\u2014especially hunger, the drive to accumu\u00ad late possessions, and sexuality\u2014and is then subject to the social and eco\u00ad nomic forces in the family, the class, and the milieu into which that person is born. The French novelist \u00c9mile Zola, beginning in the 1870s, did much to develop this theory in what he called \"le roman exp\u00e9rimental\" (that is, the 262 RECEPTION-THEORY novel organized in the mode of a scientific experiment on the behavior of the characters it depicts). Zola and later naturalistic writers, such as the Americans Frank Norris, Stephen Crane, and Theodore Dreiser, try to present their sub\u00ad jects with scientific objectivity and with elaborate documentation, sometimes including an almost medical frankness about activities and bodily functions usually unmentioned in earlier literature. They tend to choose characters who exhibit strong animal drives such as greed and sexual desire, and who are helpless victims both of glandular secretions within and of sociological pres\u00ad sures without. The end of the naturalistic novel is usually \"tragic,\" but not, as in classical and Elizabethan tragedy, because of a heroic but losing struggle of the individual mind and will against gods, enemies, and circumstances. In\u00ad stead the protagonist of the naturalistic plot, a pawn to multiple compulsions, usually disintegrates, or is wiped out. Aspects of the naturalistic selection and management of subject matter and its austere or harsh manner of rendering its materials are apparent in many modern novels and dramas, such as Hardy's Jude the Obscure, 1895 (al\u00ad though Hardy largely substituted a cosmic determinism for biological and en\u00ad vironmental determinism), various plays by Eugene O'Neill in the 1920s, and Norman Mailer's novel of World War II, The Naked and the Dead. An enlight\u00ad ening exercise is to distinguish how the relation between the sexes is repre\u00ad sented in a romance (Richard Blackmore's Loma Doone, 1869), an ironic comedy of manners Qane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, 1813), a realistic novel (William Dean Howells' A Modern Instance, 1882), and a naturalistic novel (\u00c9mile Zola's Nana, 1880, or Theodore Dreiser's An American Tragedy, 1925). Movements originally opposed both to nineteenth-century realism and natu\u00ad ralism (though some modern works, such as Joyce's Ulysses, 1922, combine as\u00ad pects of all these novelistic modes) are expressionism and symbolism (see Symbolist Movement). See socialist realism, and refer to Erich Auerbach, Mimesis: The Representa\u00ad tion of Reality in Western Literature (1953); Ian Watt, The Rise of the Novel (1957); Ernst Gombrich, Art and Illusion (1960); Harry Levin, The Gates of Horn: A Study of Five French Realists (1963); Ren\u00e9 Wellek, \"The Concept of Re\u00ad alism in Literary Scholarship,\" in Concepts of Criticism (1963); J. P. Stern, On Realism (1973); loan Williams, The Realist Novel in England (1975); George Levine, The Realistic Imagination (1981); Donald Pizer, Realism and Naturalism in Nineteenth-Century American Literature (rev., 1984). Reception-Theory is the historical application of a form of reader-response theory that was proposed by Hans Robert Jauss in \"Literary History as a Chal\u00ad lenge to Literary Theory\" (in New Literary History, Vol. 2, 1970-71). Like other reader-response criticism, it focuses on the reader's reception of a text; its prime interest, however, is not on the response of a single reader at a given time, but on the altering responses, interpretive and evaluative, of the general reading public over the course of time. Jauss proposes that although a text has no \"objective meaning,\" it does contain a variety of objectively describable features. The response of a particular reader, which constitutes for that reader REFRAIN 263 the meaning and aesthetic qualities of a text, is the joint product of the reader's own \"horizon of expectations\" and the confirmations, disappoint\u00ad ments, and reformulations of these expectations when they are \"challenged\" by the features of the text itself. Since the linguistic and aes\u00ad thetic expectations of the population of readers change over the course of time, and since later readers and critics have access not only to the text but also to the published responses of earlier readers, there develops an evolving historical \"tradition\" of critical interpretations and evaluations of a given lit\u00ad erary work. Following concepts proposed by Hans-Georg Gadamer (see under interpretation and hermen\u00e9utica), Jauss represents this tradition as a continuing \"dialectic,\" or \"dialogue,\" between a text and the horizons of successive read\u00ad ers; in itself, a literary text possesses no fixed and final meanings or value. This mode of studying literary reception as a dialogue, or \"fusion\" of horizons, has a double aspect. As a reception-aesthetic, it \"defines\" the meaning and aesthetic qualities of any individual text as a set of implicit se\u00ad mantic and aesthetic \"potentialities\" which become manifest only as they are realized by the cumulative responses of readers over the course of time. In its other aspect as a reception-history, this mode of study also transforms the history of literature\u2014traditionally conceived as an account of the succes\u00ad sive production of a variety of works with fixed meanings and values\u2014by making it a history that requires an \"ever necessary retelling,\" since it nar\u00ad rates the changing yet cumulative way that selected texts are interpreted and assessed, as the horizons of successive generations of readers alter in the pas\u00ad sage of time. See Hans Robert Jauss, Towards an Aesthetic of Reception (1982), and The Aesthetic Experience and Literary Hermeneutics (1982); and for a history and dis\u00ad cussion of this viewpoint, Robert C. Holub, Reception Theory: A Critical Intro\u00ad duction (1984). Refrain. A line, or part of a line, or a group of lines, which is repeated in the course of a poem, sometimes with slight changes, and usually at the end of each stanza. The refrain occurs in many ballads and work poems, and is a fre\u00ad quent element in Elizabethan songs, where it may be merely a nonverbal car\u00ad rier of the melodic line, as in Shakespeare's \"It Was a Lover and His Lass\": \"With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino.\" A famous refrain is that which closes each stanza in Edmund Spenser's \"Epithalamion\" (1594)\u2014\"The woods shall to me answer, and my echo ring\"\u2014in which sequential changes indicate the altering sounds during the successive hours of the poet's wedding day. The refrain in Spenser's \"Prothalamion\"\u2014\"Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song\"\u2014is echoed ironically in Part III of T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land (1922), where it is applied to the Thames in the modern age of polluted rivers. A refrain may consist only of a single word\u2014\"Nevermore\" as in Poe's \"The Raven\" (1845)\u2014or of an entire stanza. If the stanza-refrain occurs in a song, as a section to be sung by all the auditors, it is called the chorus; for, ex\u00ad ample, in \"Auld Lang Syne\" and many other songs by Robert Burns in the late eighteenth century. 264 RENAISSANCE Renaissance (\"rebirth\") is the name commonly applied to the period of Eu\u00ad ropean history following the Middle Ages; it is usually said to have begun in Italy in the late fourteenth century and to have continued, both in Italy and other countries of western Europe, through the fifteenth and sixteenth cen\u00ad turies. In this period the European arts of painting, sculpture, architecture, and literature reached an eminence not exceeded in any age. The develop\u00ad ment came late to England in the sixteenth century, and did not have its flowering until the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods; sometimes, in fact, John Milton (1608-74) is described as the last great Renaissance poet. (See pe\u00ad riods of English literature.) Many attempts have been made to define \"the Renaissance\" in a brief statement, as though a single essence underlay the complex features of the in\u00ad tellectual and cultural life of numerous European countries over several hun\u00ad dred years. It has, for example, been described as the birth of the modern world out of the ashes of the Dark Ages; as the discovery of the world and the discovery of man; and as the era of the emergence of untrammeled individu\u00ad alism in life, thought, religion, and art. Recently some historians, finding that attributes similar to these were present in various people and places in the Middle Ages, and also that many elements long held to be medieval survived into the Renaissance, have denied that the Renaissance ever existed. This skeptical opinion serves as a reminder that history is a continuous process, and that \"periods\" are not given by history but invented by historians. Nonetheless, the division of the temporal continuum into named segments is an all but indispensable convenience in discussing history. Furthermore, dur\u00ad ing the span of time called \"the Renaissance,\" it is possible to identify a num\u00ad ber of events and discoveries which, beginning approximately in the fifteenth century, clearly effected radical and distinctive changes in the beliefs, produc\u00ad tions, and manner of life of many people, especially in the upper and the in\u00ad tellectual classes. Beginning in the 1940s, a number of historians have replaced (or else supplemented) the term \"Renaissance\" with early modern to designate the span from the end of the middle ages until late in the seventeenth century. The latter term looks forward rather than back, emphasizing the degree to which the time, instead of being mainly a rebirth of the classical past, can be viewed, in its innovations and intellectual concerns, as a precursor of our present century. (See Leah S. Marcus, \"Renaissance/Early Modern Studies,\" in Redrawing the Boundaries, ed. Stephen Greenblatt and Giles Gunn, 1992.) The innovations during this period may be regarded as putting a strain on the relatively closed and stable world of the great civilization of the later Mid\u00ad dle Ages, when most of the essential and permanent truths about God, man, and the universe were considered to be adequately known. The full impact of many developments in the Renaissance did not make itself felt until the En\u00ad lightenment in the later seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries, but the fact that they occurred in this period indicates the vitality, the restless curiosity, and the imaginative audacity of many men of the era, whether scholars, thinkers, artists, or adventurers. Prominent among these developments were: RENAISSANCE 265 (1) The new learning. Renaissance scholars of the classics, called human\u00ad ists, revived the knowledge of the Greek language, discovered and dis\u00ad seminated a great number of Greek manuscripts, and added considerably to the number of Roman authors and works which had been known during the Middle Ages. The result was to open out the sense of the vastness of the historical past, as well as to enlarge im\u00ad mensely the stock of ideas, materials, literary forms, and styles avail\u00ad able to Renaissance writers. In the mid-fifteenth century the invention of printing on paper from movable type (for which Johann Guten\u00ad berg of Mainz, Germany, is usually given credit, although the Chinese had developed a similar mode of printing several centuries earlier) made books for the first time cheap and plentiful, and floods of pub\u00ad lications, ancient and modern, poured from the presses of Europe to satisfy the demands of the expanding population who had learned to read. The rapidity of the spread of ideas, discoveries, and types of lit\u00ad erature in the Renaissance was made possible by this new technology of printing. The technology reached England in 1476, when William Caxton set up a press at Westminster, where he published, among many other books, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur. The sometimes resulted in pedantic scholar\u00ad ship, sterile imitations of ancient works and styles, and a rigidly au\u00ad thoritarian rhetoric and literary criticism. It also bred, however, the gracious and tolerant humanity of an Erasmus, and the high concept of a cultivated Renaissance aristocracy expressed in Baldassare Cas- tiglione's II Cortegiano (\"The Courtier\"), published in 1528. This was the most admired and widely translated of the many Renaissance courtesy books, or books on the character, obligations, and training of the man of the court. It sets up the ideal of the completely rounded or \"universal\" man, developed in all his faculties and skills, physical, intellectual, and artistic. He is especially trained to be a warrior and statesman, but is capable also as athlete, philosopher, artist, conversa\u00ad tionalist, and man of society. The courtier's relations to women, and of women to men, are represented in accordance with the quasi- religious code of Platonic love, and his activities and productions are crowned by the grace of sprezzatura\u2014the Italian term for what seems the spontaneity and casual ease with which someone has been trained to meet the demands of very complex and exacting rules. Leonardo da Vinci in Italy and Sir Philip Sidney in England are often represented as embodying the many aspects of the courtly ideal. (2) The new religion. The Reformation led by Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a successful heresy which struck at the very foundations of the institutionalism of the Roman Catholic Church. This early Protes\u00ad tantism was grounded on each individual's inner experience of spiri\u00ad tual struggle and salvation. Faith (based on the word of the Bible) was alone thought competent to save, and salvation itself was regarded as RENAISSANCE a direct transaction with God in the theater of the individual soul, without the necessity of intermediation by Church, priest, or sacra\u00ad ment. For this reason Protestantism is sometimes said to have been an extreme manifestation of \"Renaissance individualism\" in north\u00ad ern Europe; it soon, however, developed its own type of institutional- ism in the theocracy proposed by John Calvin (1509-64) and his Puritan followers. Although England officially broke with the Catholic church during the reign of Henry VIII, the new state reli\u00ad gious establishment (the Anglican church) headed by the monarch retained many of the characteristics of the old church while embrac\u00ad ing selected Protestant theological principles. The result was a politi\u00ad cal and theological compromise that remained the subject of heated debate for centuries. (3) The new world. In 1492 Christopher Columbus, acting on the persist\u00ad ing and widespread belief in the old Greek idea that the world is a globe, sailed west to find a new commercial route to the East, only to be frustrated by the unexpected barrier of a new continent. The suc\u00ad ceeding explorations of this continent and its native populations, and its settlement by Europeans, gave new materials to the literary imagination. The magic world of Shakespeare's The Tempest, for ex\u00ad ample, as well as the treatment of its native inhabitants by Prospero and others, is based on a contemporary account of a shipwreck on Bermuda and other writings about voyages to the New World. More important for English literature, however, was the fact that economic exploitation of the new world\u2014often cruel, oppressive and devastat\u00ad ing to the native peoples\u2014put England at the center, rather than as heretofore at the edge, of the chief trade routes, and so helped estab\u00ad lish the commercial prosperity that in England, as in Italy earlier, was a necessary though not sufficient condition for the development of a vigorous intellectual and artistic life. (4) The new cosmos. The cosmos of medieval astronomy and of medieval Christian theology was Ptolemaic (that is, based on the astronomy of Ptolemy, second century) and pictured a stationary earth around which rotated the successive spheres of the moon, the various plan\u00ad ets, and then the fixed stars. Heaven, or the Empyrean, was thought to be situated above the spheres, and Hell to be situated either at the center of the earth (as in Dante's Inferno) or else below the system of the spheres (as in John Milton's Paradise Lost). In 1543 Copernicus published his new hypothesis concerning the astronomic system; this gave a much simpler and more coherent explanation of accumulating observations of the actual movements of the heavenly bodies, which had led to ever greater complications within the scheme of the Ptole\u00ad maic world picture. The Copernican theory proposed a system in which the center is the sun, not the earth, and in which the earth is not stationary, but only one planet among many planets, all of which revolve around the sun. RENAISSANCE 267 Investigations have not borne out the earlier assumption by his\u00ad torians that the world picture of Copernicus and of the scientists who followed him (sometimes referred to as the new philosophy) deliv\u00ad ered an immediate and profound shock to the theological and secular beliefs of thinking men. For example in 1611, when Donne wrote in \"The First Anniversary\" that \"new Philosophy calls all in doubt,\" for \"the Sun is lost, and th' earth,\" he did so only to support the ancient theme, or literary topos, of the world's decay, and to enforce a stan\u00ad dard Christian \"contemptus mundi\" (contempt for the worldly). Still later, Milton in Paradise Lost (1667) expressed a suspension of judg\u00ad ment between the Ptolemaic and Copernican theories; he adopted, however, the older Ptolemaic scheme as the cosmic setting for his poem, because it was more firmly traditional and better adapted to his narrative purposes. Much more important, in the long run, was the effect on men's opinions of the general principles and methods of the new science de\u00ad veloped by the great successors of Copernicus in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, such as the physicists Johannes Kepler and Galileo and the English physician and physiologist William Harvey. Even after Copernicus, the cosmos of many writers in the Elizabethan era (as exemplified in a number of Shakespeare's plays) re\u00ad mained not only Ptolemaic, it remained also an animate cosmos that was invested with occult powers and inhabited by demons and spirits, and was widely believed to control men's lives by stellar influences and to be itself subject to control by the powers of witchcraft and of magic. The cosmos that emerged in the course of the seventeenth cen\u00ad tury, as a product of the scientific procedure of constructing hypothe\u00ad ses capable of being tested by precisely measured observations, was the physical cosmos of Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650). \"Give me extension and motion,\" Descartes wrote, I will construct the universe.\" The universe of Descartes and the new science consisted of extended parti\u00ad cles of matter which moved in space according to fixed mathematical laws, free from interference by angels, demons, human prayer, or oc\u00ad cult magical powers. This universe was, however, subject to the limited manipulations of experimental scientists who set out in this way to discover the laws of nature, and who, in Francis Bacon's phrase, had learned to obey nature in order to be her master. In Descartes and other thinkers, the working hypotheses of the scientists about the physical world were converted into a philosophical worldview, which was made current by popular expositions, and\u2014together with the methodological principle that controlled observation is the criterion of truth in many areas of knowledge\u2014helped constitute the climate of eighteenth-century opinion known as the Enlightenment. Joan Kelly inaugurated a spirited debate among feminist and other schol\u00ad ars with her essay, published in 1977, \"Did Women Have a Renaissance?\" (in 268 RHETORIC Women, History and Theory, 1984). Her own answer to the question, based pri\u00ad marily on evidence from central Italy, was that women did not. For a book by a feminist scholar who counters this claim, by reference to women's changing roles in the family, in the church, and in positions of political and cultural power, see Margaret L. King, Women of the Renaissance (1991). Refer to J. Burckhardt, Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (first pub\u00ad lished in 1860); H. O. Taylor, Thought and Expression in the 16th Century (1920); E. A. Burtt, The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Science (rev., 1932); W. K. Ferguson, The Renaissance in Historical Thought (1948); C. S. Lewis, English Lit\u00ad erature in the 16th Century (1954); Marjorie Nicolson, Science and Imagination (1956); Thomas S. Kuhn, The Copernican Revolution (1957); Paul O. Kristeller, Renaissance Thought: The Classic, Scholastic, and Humanistic Strains (rev., 1961); John R. Hale, The Civilization of Europe in the Renaissance (1993). Rhetoric. In his Poetics the Greek philosopher Aristotle defined poetry as a mode of imitation\u2014a fictional representation in a verbal medium of human beings thinking, feeling, acting, and interacting\u2014and focused his discussion on elements such as plot, character, thought, and diction within the work it\u00ad self. In his Rhetoric, on the other hand, Aristotle defined rhetorical discourse as the art of \"discovering all the available means of persuasion in any given case,\" and focused his discussion on the means and devices that an orator uses in order to achieve the intellectual and emotional effects on an audience that will persuade them to accede to the orator's point of view. Most of the later rhetoricians of the classical era concurred in the view that the concern of rhetoric is with the type of discourse whose chief aim is to persuade an audi\u00ad ence to think and feel or act in a particular way. (A notable exception is the major Roman rhetorician Quintilian who, in the first century, gave rhetoric a moral basis by defining it as the art \"of a good man skilled in speaking.\") In a broad sense, then, rhetoric can be described as the study of language in its practical uses, focusing on the persuasive and other effects of language, and on the means by which one can achieve those effects on auditors or readers. Following Aristotle's lead, classical theorists analyzed an effective rhetor\u00ad ical discourse as consisting of three components: invention (the finding of ar\u00ad guments or proofs), disposition (the arrangement of such materials), and style (the choice of words, verbal patterns, and rhythms that will most effectively express and convey these materials). This last topic of \"style\" came to include extensive classifications and analyses of figurative language. Rhetoricians also discriminated three main classes of oratory, each of which uses characteristic devices to achieve its distinctive persuasive effect: (1) Deliberative\u2014to persuade an audience (such as a legislative assem\u00ad bly) to approve or disapprove of a matter of public policy, and to act accordingly. (2) Forensic\u2014to achieve (for example, in a judicial trial) either the con\u00ad demnation or approval of some person's actions. RHETORICAL CRITICISM 269 (3) Epideictic\u2014\"display rhetoric/' used on appropriate, usually ceremo\u00ad nial, occasions to enlarge upon the praiseworthiness (or sometimes, the blameworthiness) of a person or group of persons, and in so doing, to display the orator's own talents and skill in rising to the rhetorical demands of the occasion. Abraham Lincoln's \"Gettysburg Address\" is a famed instance of epideictic oratory. In America, it re\u00ad mains traditional for a chosen speaker to meet the challenge of the Fourth of July or other dates of national significance by appropriately ceremonious oratory. The ode is a poetic form often used for epideic\u00ad tic purposes. Figurative language, although dealt with at length in classical and later tra\u00ad ditional rhetorics, had been considered as only one element of style, and often, as subordinated to the overall aim of persuasion. In the present cen\u00ad tury, however (and especially in the last fifty years), the analysis of the types and functions of figurative language has been increasingly excerpted from this rhetorical context and made an independent and central concern, not only by critics of literature but also by language theorists and by philoso\u00ad phers. (See metaphor, theories of.) Some recent theorists regard all modes of dis\u00ad course to be constituted by \"rhetorical\" and figurative elements which are inherently nonreferential and counterlogical, and therefore subvert attempts to speak or write in ways that have decidable meanings, or logical coherence, or reference to a world beyond language. (See deconstruction.) Other theorists are developing a cognitive rhetoric, from the viewpoint of \"cognitive sci\u00ad ence\"\u2014that is, representations of the most general operations of the mind and brain (based in part on problems faced in developing high-level comput\u00ad ers), which cut across the standard distinctions between literary and non- literary, and between rhetorical and non-rhetorical mental and linguistic processes. See Mark Turner, Reading Minds: The Study of English in the Age of Cognitive Science (1991) and The Literary Mind (1996). Refer to ethos (the rhetorical concept of a speaker's projected character that functions as a means of persuasion) under persona, tone, and voice; also rhetorical criticism. See Aristotle's Rhetoric, ed. Lane Cooper (1932); Quintilian, Institutes of Oratory (4 vols., Loeb Classical Library, 1920-22); M. L. Clarke, Rhetoric at Rome: A Historical Survey (1953); George Kennedy, The Art of Persua\u00ad sion in Greece (1963); Edward P. J. Corbett, Classical Rhetoric for the Modern Stu\u00ad dent (4th ed., 1998). For a brief history of rhetoric, from the Greeks to the revived interest among contemporary theorists, see Renato Barilli, Rhetoric (trans., 1989). Rhetorical Criticism. The Roman Horace in his versified Art of Poetry (first century B.C. ) declared that the aim of a poet is either to instruct or delight a reader, and preferably to do both. This view, by making poetry a calculated means to achieve effects on its audience, breaks down Aristotle's distinction between imitative poetry and persuasive rhetoric (see rhetoric). Such pragmatic 270 RHETORICAL FIGURES criticism became the dominant type of literary theory from late classical times through the eighteenth century. Discussions of poetry in that long span of time absorbed and expanded upon the analytic terms that had been devel\u00ad oped in traditional rhetoric, and represented a poem mainly as a deployment of established artistic means for achieving foreseen effects upon its readers. The triumph in the early nineteenth century of expressive theories of literature (which conceive a work primarily as the expression of the feelings, tempera\u00ad ment, and mental powers of the author), followed by the prominence, begin\u00ad ning in the 1920s, of objective theories of literature (which maintain that a work must be considered as an object in itself, independently of the attributes and intentions of the author and the responses of a reader), served to dimin\u00ad ish, and sometimes to eliminate, rhetorical considerations in literary criti\u00ad cism. (See under criticism.) Since the late 1950s, however, there has been a revival of interest in liter\u00ad ature as a mode of communication from author to reader, and this has led to the development of a rhetorical criticism which, without departing from a primary focus on the literary work itself, undertakes to identify and analyze those elements within a poem or a prose narrative which are there primarily in order to effect certain responses in a reader. As Wayne Booth said in the preface to his influential book The Rhetoric of Fiction (1961), his subject is \"the rhetorical resources available to the writer of epic, novel, or short story as he tries, consciously or unconsciously, to impose his fictional world upon the reader.\" A number of recent critics of prose fiction and of narrative and non- narrative poems have emphasized the author's use of a variety of means\u2014in\u00ad cluding the authorial presence or \"voice\" that he or she projects\u2014in order to engage the interest and guide the imaginative and emotional responses of the readers to whom, whether consciously or not, the literary work is addressed. (See persona, tone, and voice.) Since the 1960s there has also emerged a reader- response criticism which focuses upon a reader's interpretive responses to the sequence of words in a literary text; most of its representatives, however, ei\u00ad ther ignore or reject the rhetorical view that such responses are effected by de\u00ad vices that, for the most part, are contrived for that purpose by the author. (See reader-response criticism.) For recent examples of the rhetorical criticism of poetry and fiction see (in addition to Wayne Booth) Kenneth Burke, A Rhetoric of Motives (1955); M. H. Nichols, Rhetoric and Criticism (1963); Donald C. Bryant, ed., Papers in Rhetoric and Poetic (1965); Edward P. J. Corbett, ed., Rhetorical Analyses of Literary Works (1969); Brian Vickers, Classical Rhetoric in English Poetry (2d ed., 1989). Rhetorical Figures. It is convenient to list under this heading some com\u00ad mon \"figures of speech\" which, according to the traditional analysis, depart from what is experienced by competent users to be the standard, or \"literal,\" use of language mainly by the arrangement of their words to achieve special effects, and not, like metaphors and other tropes, by a radical change in the meaning of the words themselves. (See figurative language.) A number of cur\u00ad rent theorists, however, reject the distinction between figures of speech and RHETORICAL FIGURES tropes; some reject even the general distinction between literal and figurative language. (See metaphor, theories of.) An apostrophe is a direct and explicit address either to an absent person or to an abstract or nonhuman entity. Often the effect is of high formality, or else of a sudden emotional impetus. Many odes are constituted throughout in the mode of such an address to a listener who is not literally able to listen. So John Keats begins his \"Ode on a Grecian Urn\" (1820) by apostrophizing the Urn\u2014\"Thou still unravished bride of quietness\"\u2014and directs the entirety of the poem to the Urn and to the figures represented on it. Samuel Taylor Cole\u00ad ridge's fine lyric \"Recollections of Love\" (1817) is an apostrophe addressed to an absent woman; at the end of the poem, Coleridge, while speaking still to his beloved, turns by a sudden impulse to apostrophize also the River Greta: But when those meek eyes first did seem To tell me, Love within you wrought\u2014 O Greta, dear domestic stream! Has not, since then, Love's prompture deep, Has not Love's whisper evermore Been ceaseless, as thy gentle roar? Sole voice, when other voices sleep, Dear under-song in clamor's hour. Many apostrophes, as in these examples from Keats and Coleridge, imply a personification of the nonhuman object that is addressed. (See Jonathan Culler, \"Apostrophe,\" in The Pursuit of Signs, 1981.) If such an address is to a god or muse or other supernatural being to assist the poet in his composition, it is called an invocation. An invocation often serves to establish the authoritative or prophetic identity of the poetic voice; thus John Milton invokes divine guidance at the opening of Paradise Lost: And chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer Before all temples th' upright heart and pure, Instruct me. ... A rhetorical question is a sentence in the grammatical form of a ques\u00ad tion which is not asked in order to request information or to invite a reply, but to achieve a greater expressive force than a direct assertion. In everyday discourse, for example, if we utter the rhetorical question \"Isn't it a shame?\" it functions as a forceful alternative to the assertion \"It's a shame.\" (In terms of modern speech-act theory, its \"illocutionary force\" is not to question but to as\u00ad sert.) The figure is often used in persuasive discourse, and tends to impart an oratorical tone to an utterance, whether in prose or verse. When \"fierce Thalestris\" in Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock (1714) asks Belinda, Gods! Shall the ravisher display your hair, While the fops envy, and the ladies stare? she does not stay for an answer, which she obviously thinks should be \"No!\" (A common form of rhetorical question is one that won't take \"Yes\" for an an\u00ad swer.) Shelley's \"Ode to the West Wind\" (1820) closes with the most famous rhetorical question in English: 272 RHETORICAL FIGURES O, Wind, If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind? This figure was a favorite of W. B. Yeats. A well-known instance is \"Among School Children,\" which ends with the rhetorical question, \"How can we know the dancer from the dance?\" In this instance the poetic context proba\u00ad bly indicates that the question is left hanging because it is unanswerable, pos\u00ad ing a problem for which there is no certain resolution. Chiasmus (derived from the Greek term for the letter X, or for a crossover) is a sequence of two phrases or clauses which are parallel in syntax, but reverse the order of the corresponding words. So in this line from Pope, the verb first precedes, then follows, the adverbial phrase: Works without show, and without pomp presides. The cross-over is sometimes reinforced by alliteration and other similarities in the length and component sounds of words, as in Pope's summary of the common fate of coquettes after marriage: A fop their passion, but their prize a sot. In Yeats' \"An Irish Airman Foresees His Death\" (1919), the chiasmus consists in a reversal of the position of an entire phrase: The years to come seemed waste of breath, A waste of breath the years behind.* And as a reminder that all figures of speech are used in prose as well as in verse, here is an instance of chiasmus in the position of the two adjectives in Shelley's Defence of Poetry (1821): \"Poetry is the record of the best and happi\u00ad est moments of the happiest and best minds.\" Zeugma in Greek means \"yoking\"; in the most common present usage, it is applied to expressions in which a single word stands in the same grammat\u00ad ical relation to two or more other words, but with an obvious shift in its sig\u00ad nificance. Sometimes the word is literal in one relation and metaphorical in the other. Here are examples of zeugma in Pope: Or stain her honour, or her new brocade. Obliged by hunger, and request of friends. Byron uses zeugma for grimly comic effects in his description of a shipwreck in Don Juan (1819-24), Canto 2: And the waves oozing through the port-hole made His berth a little damp, and him afraid. The loud tempests raise The waters, and repentance for past sinning. To achieve the maximum of concentrated verbal effects within the tight limits of the closed couplet, Pope in the early eighteenth century exploited all *Lines from \"An Irish Airman Foresees His Death\" reprinted with permission of Macmillan Publishing Company from The Poems of W.

RHYME 273 the language patterns described in this entry with supreme virtuosity. He is an English master of the rhetorical figures, as Shakespeare is of tropes. Other linguistic patterns or \"schemes\" that are sometimes classified as rhetorical figures are treated elsewhere in this Glossary; see antithesis, allitera\u00ad tion, assonance, rhetorical climax (under bathos), and parallelism. For concise definitions and examples of additional figures of speech which are less com\u00ad monly referred to in literary analyses, see Edward P. J. Corbett, Classical Rhetoric for the Modern Student (4th ed., 1998). Rhyme. In English versification, standard rhyme consists of the repetition, in the rhyming words, of the last stressed vowel and of all the speech sounds following that vowel: l\u00e1te-f\u00e1te; f\u00f3llow-h\u00f3llow. End rhymes, by far the most frequent type, occur at the end of a verse- line. Internal rhymes occur within a verse-line, as in the Victorian poet Algernon Swinburne's Sister, my sister, O fleet sweet swallow. A stanza from Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" illustrates the patterned use both of internal rhymes (within lines 1 and 3) and of an end rhyme (lines 2 and 4): In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud, It perched for vespers nine-, Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white, Glimmered the white moon-shine. The numbered lines in the following stanza of Wordsworth's \"The Solitary Reaper\" (1807) are followed by a column which, in the conventional way, marks the terminal rhyme elements by a corresponding sequence and repeti\u00ad tion of the letters of the alphabet: (1) Whate'er her theme, the maiden sang a (2) As if her song could have no ending; b (3) I saw her singing at her work c (4) And o'er the sickle bending\u2014 b (5) I listened, motionless and still; d (6) And as I mounted up the hill, d (7) The music in my heart I bore, e (8) Long after it was heard no more e Lines 1 and 3 do not rhyme with any other line. Both in lines 5 and 6 and lines 7 and 8 the rhyme consists of a single stressed syllable, and is called a masculine rhyme: still-hill, b\u00f3re-m\u00f3re. In lines 2 and 4, the rhyme consists of a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable, and is called a femi\u00ad nine rhyme: \u00e9nd\u00efng-b\u00e9nd\u00efng. A feminine rhyme, since it involves the repetition of two syllables, is also known as a double rhyme. A rhyme involving three syllables is called a triple rhyme; such rhymes, since they coincide with surprising patness, usually have a comic quality. In Don Juan (1819-24) Byron often uses triple rhymes 274 RHYME such as comparison-garrison, and sometimes intensifies the comic effect by permitting the pressure of the rhyme to force a distortion of the pronuncia\u00ad tion. This maltreatment of words, called forced rhyme, in which the poet gives the effect of seeming to surrender helplessly to the exigencies of a diffi\u00ad cult rhyme, has been comically exploited by the poet Ogden Nash: Farewell, farewell, you old rhinocerous, I'll stare at something less prepocerous.* If the correspondence of the rhymed sounds is exact, it is called perfect rhyme, or else \"full\" or \"true rhyme.\" Until recently almost all English writers of serious poems have limited themselves to perfect rhymes, except for an oc\u00ad casional poetic license such as eye- rhymes: words whose endings are spelled alike, and in most instances were once pronounced alike, but have in the course of time acquired a different pronunciation: prove-love, daughter- laughter. Many modern poets, however, deliberately supplement perfect rhyme with imperfect rhyme (also known as partial rhyme, or else as \"near rhyme,\" \"slant rhyme,\" or \"pararhyme\"). This effect is fairly common in folk poetry such as children's verses, and it was employed occasionally by various writers of art lyrics such as Henry Vaughan in the seventeenth, William Blake in the late eighteenth, and very frequently by Emily Dickinson in the nine\u00ad teenth century. More recently, Gerard Manley Hopkins, W. B. Yeats, Wilfred Owen, and other poets have systematically exploited partial rhymes, in which the vowels are only approximate or else quite different, and occasionally even the rhymed consonants are similar rather than identical. Wilfred Owen, in 1917-18, wrote the following six-line stanza using only two sets of partial rhymes, established at the ends of the first two lines: The centuries will burn rich loads With which we groaned, Whose warmth shall lull their dreamy lids, While songs are crooned. But they will not dream of us poor lads, Lost in the ground.** In his poem \"The Force That Through the Green Fuse Drives the Flower\" (1933), Dylan Thomas uses, very effectively, such distantly approximate rhymes as (with masculine endings) trees-rose, rocks-wax, tomb-worm, and (with feminine endings) flower-destroyer-fever. The passages quoted will illustrate some of the many effects that can be achieved by the device that has been called \"making ends meet in verse\"\u2014the pleasure of the expected yet varying chime; the reinforcement of syntax and rhetorical emphasis when a strong masculine rhyme concurs with the end of a clause, sentence, or stanza; the sudden grace of movement which may be lent *Lines from \"The Rhinoceros\" by Ogden Nash, from Verses from 1929 On by Ogden Nash.

ROMAN \u00c0 CLEF \u00b7 SATIRE 275 by a feminine rhyme; the broadening of the comic by a pat coincidence of sound; the haunting effect of the limited consonance in partial rhymes. Cun\u00ad ning artificers in verse make rhyme more than an auxiliary sound effect; they use it to enhance or contribute to the significance of the words. When Pope in the early eighteenth century satirized two contemporary pedants in the lines Yet ne'er one sprig of laurel graced these ribalds, From slashing Bentley down to piddling Tibalds, the rhyme of \"Tibalds,\" as W. K. Wimsatt has said, demonstrates \"what it means to have a name like that,\" with its implication that the scholar is a graceless as his appellation. And in one of its important functions, rhyme ties individual lines into the larger pattern of a stanza. See George Saintsbury, History of English Prosody (3 vols., 1906-10); H. C. K. Wyld, Studies in English Rhymes (1923); W. K. Wimsatt, \"One Relation of Rhyme to Reason,\" in The Verbal Icon (1954); Donald Wesling, The Chances of Rhyme: Device and Modernity (1980); John Hollander, Rhyme's Reason: A Guide to English Verse (1981). For an analysis of the complex interrelations be\u00ad tween sound-repetitions and meaning, see Roman Jakobson, \"Linguistics and Poetics,\" in his Language and Literature (1987). Roman \u00e0 clef (French for \"novel with a key\") is a work of prose fiction in which the author expects the knowing reader to identify, despite their altered names, actual people of the time. The mode was begun in seventeenth-century France with novels such as Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry's Le Grand Cyrus (1649-53). An English example is Thomas Love Peacock's Nightmare Abbey (1818), whose characters are entertaining caricatures of such contemporary literary figures as Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley. A later instance is Aldous Huxley's Point Counter Point (1928), in which we find, under fictional names, well-known English people of the 1920s such as the novelist D. H. Lawrence, the critic Middleton Murry, and the right-wing political extremist Oswald Mosely. Satire can be described as the literary art of diminishing or derogating a sub\u00ad ject by making it ridiculous and evoking toward it attitudes of amusement, contempt, scorn, or indignation. It differs from the comic in that comedy evokes laughter mainly as an end in itself, while satire derides; that is, it uses laughter as a weapon, and against a butt that exists outside the work itself. That butt may be an individual (in \"personal satire\"), or a type of person, a class, an institution, a nation, or even (as in the Earl of Rochester's \"A Satyr against Mankind,\" 1675, and much of Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, 1726, especially Book IV) the entire human race. The distinction between the comic and the satiric, however, is sharp only at its extremes. Shakespeare's Falstaff is a comic creation, presented primarily for our enjoyment; the puritanical Malvolio in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night is for the most part comic but has as\u00ad pects of satire directed against the type of the fatuous and hypocritical Puritan; Ben Jonson's Volpone (1607) clearly satirizes the type of person whose clever\u00ad ness\u2014or stupidity\u2014is put at the service of his cupidity; and John Dryden's 276 SATIRE MacFlecknoe (1682), while representing a permanent type of the pretentious po\u00ad etaster, satirized specifically the living author Thomas Shadwell. Satire has usually been justified by those who practice it as a corrective of human vice and folly; Alexander Pope, for example, remarked that \"those who are ashamed of nothing else are so of being ridiculous.\" Its frequent claim (not always borne out in the practice) has been to ridicule the failing rather than the individual, and to limit its ridicule to corrigible faults, exclud\u00ad ing those for which a person is not responsible. As Swift said, speaking of him\u00ad self in his ironic \"Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift\" (1739): Yet malice never was his aim; He lashed the vice, but spared the name. ... His satire points at no defect, But what all mortals may correct.... He spared a hump, or crooked nose, Whose owners set not up for beaux. Satire occurs as an incidental element within many works whose overall mode is not satiric\u2014in a certain character or situation, or in an interpolated passage of ironic commentary on some aspect of the human condition or of contemporary society. But for some literary writings, verse or prose, the at\u00ad tempt to diminish a subject by ridicule is the primary organizing principle, and these works constitute the formal genre labeled \"satires.\" In discussing such writings the following distinctions are useful. (1) Critics make a broad division between formal (or \"direct\") satire and in\u00ad direct satire. In formal satire the satiric persona speaks out in the first person. This \"I\" may address either the reader (as in Pope's Moral Essays, 1731-35), or else a character within the work itself, who is called the adversarius and whose major artistic function is to elicit and add cred\u00ad ibility to the satiric speaker's comments. (In Pope's Dr. Ar- buthnot,\" 1735, Arbuthnot serves as adversarius.) Two types of formal satire are commonly distinguished, taking their names from the great Roman satirists Horace and Juvenal. The types are defined by the char\u00ad acter of the persona whom the author presents as the first-person satiric speaker, and also by the attitude and tone that such a persona manifests toward both the subject matter and the readers of the work. In Horatian satire the speaker manifests the character of an ur\u00ad bane, witty, and tolerant man of the world, who is moved more often to wry amusement than to indignation at the spectacle of human folly, pretentiousness, and hypocrisy, and who uses a relaxed and in\u00ad formal language to evoke from readers a wry smile at human failings and absurdities\u2014sometimes including his own. Horace himself de\u00ad scribed his aim as \"to laugh people out of their vices and follies.\" Pope's Moral Essays and other formal satires for the most part sustain an Horatian stance. In Juvenalian satire the character of the speaker is that of a seri\u00ad ous moralist who uses a dignified and public style of utterance to SATIRE decry modes of vice and error which are no less dangerous because they are ridiculous, and who undertakes to evoke from readers con\u00ad tempt, moral indignation, or an unillusioned sadness at the aberra\u00ad tions of humanity. Samuel (1738) and \"The Human Wishes\" (1749) are distinguished instances of Juve- nalian satire. In its most denunciatory modes, it resembles the jere\u00ad miad, whose model is not Roman but Hebraic. (2) Indirect satire is cast in some other literary form than that of direct address to the reader. The most common indirect form is that of a fic\u00ad tional narrative, in which the objects of the satire are characters who make themselves and their opinions ridiculous or obnoxious by what they think, say, and do, and are sometimes made even more ridicu\u00ad lous by the author's comments and narrative style. One type of indirect satire is Menippean satire, modeled on a Greek form developed by the Cynic philosopher Menippus. It is sometimes called Varronian satire, after a Roman imitator, Varr\u00f2; while Northrop Frye, in Anatomy of Criticism, pp. 308-12, suggests an alternative name, the anatomy, after a major English instance of the type, Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy (1621). Such satires are written in prose, usually with interpolations of verse, and constitute a miscel\u00ad laneous form often held together by a loosely constructed narrative. A major feature is a series of extended dialogues and debates (often conducted at a banquet or party) in which a group of loquacious ec\u00ad centrics, pedants, literary people, and representatives of various pro\u00ad fessions or philosophical points of view serve to make ludicrous the attitudes and viewpoints they typify by the arguments they urge in their support. Examples are Rabelais' Gargantua and Pantagruel (1564), Voltaire's Candide (1759), Thomas Love Nightmare Abbey (1818) and other satiric fiction, and Huxley's Point Counter Point (1928); in this last novel, as in those of Peacock, the central satiric scenes are discussions and disputes during a weekend at a country manor. Frye also classifies Lewis Carroll's two books about Alice in Wonderland as \"perfect Menippean satires.\" It should be noted that any narrative or other literary vehicle can be adapted to the purposes of indirect satire. John Dryden's Absalom and Achitophel turns Old Testament history into a satiric allegory on Restoration political maneuverings. In Gulliver's Travels Swift converts to satiric use the early eighteenth-century accounts of voyage and dis\u00ad covery, and his Modest Proposal is written in the form of a project in political economy. Many of Joseph Addison's Spectator papers are satiric essays; Byron's Don Juan is a versified satiric form of the old episodic picaresque fiction; Ben Jonson's The Alchemist, Moli\u00e8re's The Misanthrope, Wycherley's The Country Wife, and Shaw's Arms and the Man are satiric plays; and Gilbert and Sullivan's Patience, and other works such as John Gay's eighteenth-century Beggar's Opera and its modern adaptation by Bertolt Brecht, The Threepenny Opera (1928), 278 SCIENCE FICTION AND FANTASY are satiric operettas. T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land (1922) employs motifs from myth in a work which can be considered as by and large a verse satire directed against what Eliot perceives as the spiritual dearth in twentieth-century life. The greatest number of recent satires, how\u00ad ever, are written in prose, and especially in novelistic form; for exam\u00ad ple Evelyn Waugh's The Loved One, Joseph Heller's Catch-22, and Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.'s Player Piano and Cat's Cradle. Much of the current vogue of black humor occurs in satiric works whose butt is what the author conceives to be the widespread contemporary condition of so\u00ad cial cruelty, inanity, or chaos. Effective English satire has been written in every period begin\u00ad ning with the Middle Ages. Pieces in the English Punch and the Amer\u00ad ican New Yorker demonstrate that formal essayistic satire, like satiric novels and plays, still commands a wide audience; and W. H. Auden is a twentieth-century author who wrote excellent satiric poems. The proportioning of the examples in this article, however, indicates how large the Restoration and eighteenth century loom in satiric achieve\u00ad ment: the century and a half that included Dryden, the Earl of Rochester, Samuel Butler, Wycherley, Aphra Behn, Addison, Pope, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Swift, Gay, Fielding, Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, and late in the period (it should not be overlooked) the Robert Burns of \"The Holy Fair\" and \"Holy Willie's Prayer\" and the William Blake of The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. This same span of time was also in France the period of such major satirists as Boileau, La Fontaine, and Voltaire, as well as Moli\u00e8re, the most eminent of all satirists in drama. American satire broke free of English in the nine\u00ad teenth century with the light satiric touch of Washington Irving's Sketch Book, the deft satiric essays of Oliver Wendell Holmes (The Au\u00ad tocrat of the Breakfast Table), and above all the satiric essays and novels of Mark Twain. See also light verse. The articles on burlesque, on irony, and on wit, humor, and the comic describe some of the derogatory modes and de\u00ad vices available to satirists.

Kernan, The Plot of Satire (1965); Matthew Hodgart, Satire (1969); Charles Sanders, The Scope of Satire (1971); Michael Seidel, Satiric Inheritance, Rabelais to Critical R\u00e9introduction ed., Satire: Modern Essays in Crit\u00ad icism (1971); Ashley Brown and John L. Kimmey, eds., Satire: An An\u00ad thology (1977), which includes both satiric writings and critical essays on satire. Science f\u00edction and fantasy. These terms encompass novels and short sto\u00ad ries that represent an imagined reality that is radically different in its nature and functioning from the world of our ordinary experience. Often the set\u00ad ting is another planet, or this earth projected into the future, or an imagined SEMIOTICS 279 parallel universe. The two terms are not sharply discriminated, but by and large science fiction is applied to those narratives in which\u2014unlike in pure fantasy\u2014an explicit attempt is made to render plausible the fictional world by reference to known or imagined scientific principles, or to a projected advance in technology, or to a drastic change in the organization of society. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818) is often considered a precursor of sci\u00ad ence fiction, but the basing of fictional worlds on explicit and coherently de\u00ad veloped scientific principles did not occur until later in the nineteenth century, in such writings as Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth and H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds. Recent important authors of science fiction include Isaac Asimov, Arthur Clarke, Ray Bradbury, J. G. Ballard, and Doris Lessing. Science fiction is also frequently represented in television and film; a notable instance is the Star Trek series. Fantasy is as old as the fictional utopias, and its satiric forms have an im\u00ad portant precursor in the extraordinary countries portrayed in Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726). Among the notable recent writers of fantasy are C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien (The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings), whose works in\u00ad corporate materials from classical, biblical, and medieval sources. Ursula Le Guin is a major author of both science fiction and works of fantasy. Some instances of science fiction and fantasy project a future utopia (Le Guin's The Dispossessed), or else attack an aspect of current science or society by imagining their dystopian conclusion (George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty- Four and Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle); and many writers use their imaginary settings, as Swift had in Gulliver's Travels, for political and social satire (Aldous Huxley's Brave New World and much of Vonnegut's prose fiction). See utopia and dystopia and satire. A recent development is cyberpunk, a postmodern form of science fiction in which the events take place partially or entirely within the \"virtual reality\" formed by computers or computer networks, in which the characters may be either human or artificial intelligences. A well-known instance is William Gibson's Neuromancer. See the essays in Fiction 2000: Cyberpunk and the Future of Narrative, ed. George Slusser and Tom Shippey (1992).

Wolfe, Critical Terms for Science Fiction and Fantasy (1986); Jane Donawerth, Frankenstein's Daughters: Women Writing Science Fiction (1997). Semiotics. At the end of the nineteenth century Charles Sanders Peirce, the American philosopher, described a study that he called \"semiotic,\" and in his Course in General Linguistics (1915) the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure in\u00ad dependently proposed a science that he called \"semiology.\" Since then semi\u00ad otics and semiology have become alternative names for the systematic study 280 SEMIOTICS of signs, as these function in all areas of human experience. The consideration of signs (conveyors of meaning) is not limited to explicit systems of commu\u00ad nication such as language, the Morse code, and traffic signs and signals; a great diversity of other human activities and productions\u2014our bodily pos\u00ad tures and gestures, the social rituals we perform, the kinds of clothes we wear, the meals we serve, the buildings we inhabit, the objects we deal with\u2014con\u00ad vey common meanings to members who participate in a particular culture, and so can be analyzed as signs which function in diverse kinds of signifying systems. Although the study of language (the use of specifically verbal signs) is technically regarded as only one branch of the general science of semiotics, linguistics, the highly developed science of language, in fact has for the most part supplied the basic concepts and methods that a semiotician applies to the study of other social sign-systems. C. S. Peirce distinguished three classes of signs, defined in terms of the kind of relation between a signifying item and that which it signifies: (1) An icon functions as a sign by means of inherent similarities, or shared features, with what it signifies; examples are the similarity of a portrait to the person it depicts, or the similarity of a map to the geographical area it stands for. (2) An index is a sign which bears a natural relation of cause or of effect to what it signifies; thus, smoke is a sign indicating fire, and a pointing weathervane in\u00ad dicates the direction of the wind. (3) In the symbol (or in a less ambiguous term, the \"sign proper\"), the relation between the signifying item and what it signifies is not a natural one, but entirely a matter of social convention. The gesture of shaking hands, for example, in some cultures is a conventional sign of greeting or parting, and a red traffic light conventionally signifies \"Stop!\" The major and most complex examples of this third type of purely conven\u00ad tional sign, however, are the words that constitute a language. Saussure introduced many of the terms and concepts exploited by current semioticians; see Saussure under linguistics in modern criticism. Most important are the following: (1) A sign consists of two inseparable components or aspects, the signifier (in language, a set of speech sounds, or of marks on a page) and the signified (the concept, or idea, which is the meaning of the sign). (2) A verbal sign, in Saussure's term, is \"arbitrary.\" That is, with the minor exception of ono\u00ad matopoeia (words which we perceive as similar to the sounds they signify), there is no inherent, or natural, connection between a verbal signifier and what it signifies. (3) The identity of all elements of a language, including its words, their component speech sounds, and the concepts the words signify, are not determined by \"positive qualities,\" or objective features in these ele\u00ad ments themselves, but by differences, or a network of relationships, consisting of distinctions and oppositions from other speech sounds, other words, and other signifieds that obtain only within a particular linguistic system. (4) The aim of linguistics, or of any other semiotic enterprise, is to regard the parole (a single verbal utterance, or a particular use of a sign or set of signs) as only a manifestation of the langue (that is, the general system of implicit differentia\u00ad tions and rules of combination which underlie and make possible a particular use of signs). The focus of semiotic interest, accordingly, is not in interpreting SEMIOTICS a particular instance of signification but in establishing the general signifying system that each particular instance manifests. Modern semiotics, like structuralism, has developed in France under the aegis of Saussure, so that many semioticians are also structuralists. They deal with any set of social phenomena or productions as \"texts\"; that is, as consti\u00ad tuted by self-sufficient, self-ordering, hierarchical structures of differentially determined signs, codes, and rules of combination and transformation which make the texts \"meaningful\" to members of a particular society who are com\u00ad petent in that signifying system. (See structuralist criticism.) Claude L\u00e9vi- Strauss, in the 1960s and later, inaugurated the application of semiotics to cultural anthropology, and also established the foundations of French struc\u00ad turalism in general, by using Saussure's linguistics as a model for analyzing, in primitive societies, a great variety of phenomena and practices, which he treated as quasi-languages that manifest the structures of an underlying signi\u00ad fying system. These include kinship systems, totemic systems, ways of prepar\u00ad ing food, myths, and prelogical modes of interpreting the world. Jacques Lacan has applied semiotics to Freudian psychoanalysis\u2014interpreting the uncon\u00ad scious, for example, as (like language) a structure of signs (see Lacan under psy\u00ad choanalysis and psychoanalytic criticism). Michel Foucault developed a mode of semiotic analysis to deal with the changing medical interpretations of symptoms of disease, the diverse ways of identifying, classifying, and treating insanity, and the altering conceptions of human sexuality (see under poststruc- turalism). Roland Barthes, explicitly applying Saussurean principles and meth\u00ad ods, has written semiotic analyses of the constituents and codes of the differential sign-systems in advertisements which describe and promote women's fashions, as well as analyses of many \"bourgeois myths\" about the world which, he claims, are exemplified in such social sign-systems as profes\u00ad sional wrestling matches, children's toys, cookery, and the striptease. (See his Mythologies, trans., 1972.) Barthes was also in his earlier writings a major expo\u00ad nent of structuralist criticism, which deals with a literary text as \"a second-order semiotic system\"; that is, it views a literary text as employing the first-order semiotic system of language to form a secondary semiotic structure, in accor\u00ad dance with a specifically literary system of conventions and codes. For a related field of study, which can be characterized as the semiotics of culture, see cultural studies. Introductions to the elements of semiotic theory are included in Terence Hawkes, Stucturalism and Semiotics (1981); Robert Scholes, Semiotics and Interpretation (1982); and in the anthologies, Thomas A. Sebeok, ed., The Tell-Tale Sign: A Survey of Semiotics (1975); and Robert E. Innis, ed., Semiotics: An Introductory Anthology (1985). See also Umberto Eco, A Theory of Semiotics (1976); Roland A. Sebeok, Semiotics in the United States (1991). Among the semiotic analyses of diverse social phenomena available in English are Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Structural Anthropology (1968) and The Raw and the Cooked (1966); Roland Barthes, Mythologies (1972), also Selected Writings, ed. Susan Sontag (1983); Jacques Lacan, The Language of the Self: The Function of Language in Psychoanalysis (1968); and Michel Foucault, The Archaeology of 282 SENSIBILITY, LITERATURE OF Knowledge (1972), Madness and Civilization (1965), and The Birth of the Clinic (1973).

For a critical view, see J. G. Merquior, From Prague to Paris (1986). Sensibility, Literature of. When a modern critic talks of a poet's sensibil\u00ad ity, the reference is to a characteristic way of responding, in perception, thought, and feeling, to experience; and when T. S. Eliot claimed that a disso\u00ad ciation of sensibility set in with the poetry of John Milton and John Dryden, he signified that there occurred at that time a division between a poet's sensuous, intellectual, and emotional modes of experience. When a literary historian, however, talks of the literature of sensibility, the reference is to a particular cultural phenomenon of the eighteenth century. This type of literature was fostered by the moral philosophy that had developed as a reaction against seventeenth-century Stoicism (which emphasized reason and the unemo\u00ad tional will as the sole motives to virtue), and even more importantly, as a re\u00ad action against Thomas Hobbes' claims, in Leviathan (1651), that a human being is innately selfish and that the mainsprings of human behavior are self- interest and the drive for power and status. In opposition to such views, many sermons, philosophical writings, and popular tracts and essays proclaimed that \"benevolence\"\u2014wishing other persons well\u2014is an innate human senti\u00ad ment and motive, and that central elements in moral experience are the feel\u00ad ings of sympathy and \"sensibility\"\u2014that is, a hair-trigger responsiveness to another person's distresses and joys. (See empathy and sympathy.) \"Sensibility\" also connoted an intense emotional responsiveness to beauty and sublimity, whether in nature or in art, and such responsiveness was often represented as an index to a person's gentility\u2014that is, to one's upper-class status. Emphasis on the human capacities of sympathy and wishing others well\u2014an important contribution was Adam Smith's The Theory of Moral Senti\u00ad ments (1759)\u2014helped to develop social consciousness and a sense of commu\u00ad nal responsibility in an era of expanding commercialism and of an economy based on self interest. Highly exaggerated forms of sympathy and benevolence, however, became prominent in eighteenth-century culture and literature. It was a commonplace in popular morality that readiness to shed a sympathetic tear is the sign both of polite breeding and a virtuous heart, and such a view was often accompanied by the observation that sympathy with another's grief, unlike personal grief, is a pleasurable emotion, hence to be sought as a value in itself. Common phrases in the cult of sensibility were the oxymorons \"the lux\u00ad ury of hast a Heart fam'd for Tenderness and Pity, Contemplate this Spot. In which are deposited the Remains of a Young Lady.... When Nerves were too delicately spun to bear the rude Shakes and Jostlings which we meet with in this transitory world, Nature gave way; She sunk and died a Martyr to Excessive Sensibility. SENSIBILITY, LITERATURE OF It is clear that much of what in that age was called, with approval, \"sensibil\u00ad ity\" we now call, with disapproval, sentimentalism. In literature these ideas and tendencies were reflected in the drama of sen\u00ad sibility, or sentimental comedy, which were representations of middle-class life that replaced in the theater the tough amorality and the comic or satiric rep\u00ad resentation of aristocratic sexual license in Restoration comedy. In the contempo\u00ad rary plays of sensibility, Oliver Goldsmith remarked in his \"Comparison between Sentimental and Laughing Comedy\" (1773), \"the virtues of private life are exhibited rather than the vices exposed, and the distresses rather than the faults of mankind make our interest in the piece\"; the characters, \"though they want humor, have abundance of sentiment and feeling;\" with the result, he added, that the audience \"sit at a play as gloomy as at the tabernacle.\" Plays such as Richard Steele's The Conscious Lovers (1722) and Richard Cumberland's The West Indian (1771) present monumentally benevolent heroes and heroines of the middle class, whose dialogue abounds with elevated moral sentiments and who, prior to the manipulated happy ending, suffer tribulations designed to evoke from the audience the maximum of pleasurable tears. The novel of sensibility, or sentimental novel, of the latter part of the eighteenth century similarly emphasized the tearful distresses of the virtuous, either at their own sorrows or at those of their friends; some of them repre\u00ad sented in addition a sensitivity to beauty or sublimity in natural phenomena which also expressed itself in tears. Samuel Richardson's Pamela; or, Virtue Re\u00ad warded (1740) exploits sensibility in of its scenes; and Laurence Sterne, in Tristram Shandy and A Sentimental Journey, published in the 1760s, gives us his own inimitable compound of sensibility, self irony, and innuendo. The vogue of sensibility was international. Jean-Jacques Rousseau's novel Julie, or the New H\u00e9loise (1761) dealt with lovers of sensibility, and in his autobiogra\u00ad phy The Confessions (written 1764-70), Rousseau represented himself, in some circumstances and moods, as a man of extravagant sensibility. Goethe's novel The Sonows of Young Werther (1774) is a famed presentation of the aes\u00ad thetic sensitivities and finespun emotional tribulations of a young man who, frustrated in his love for a woman betrothed to another, and in general unable to adapt his sensibility to the demands of ordinary life, finally shoots himself. An extreme English instance of the sentimental novel is Henry MacKen- zie's The Man of Feeling (1771), which represents a hero of such exquisite sen\u00ad sibility that he goes into a decline from excess of pent-up tenderness toward a young lady, and dies in the perturbation of finally declaring to her his emo\u00ad tion. \"If all his tears had been tears of blood,\" declares an editor of the novel, Hamish Miles, \"the poor man could hardly have been more debile.\" Jane Austen's gently satiric treatment of a young woman of sensibility in Sense and Sensibility (begun 1797, published 1811) marks the decline of the fashion; but the exploitation of the mode of literary sensibility survives in such later nov- elistic episodes as the death of Little Nell in Charles Dickens' Old Curiosity Shop (1841) and the death of Little Eva in Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), in some Victorian melodramas, as well as in many movies that Hollywood labeled \"tearjerkers.\" 284 SENTIMENTALISM \u00b7 SETTING In The Politics of Sensibility (1996), Markman Ellis departs from the usual treatment of the sentimental novels of the later eighteenth century, by argu\u00ad ing that they participated in some major controversies and reform move\u00ad ments, including opposition to slavery, discussions of the morality involved in commercial and business practices, and the movement for the reformation of prostitutes. See Age of Sensibility under Periods of English Literature. Refer to Herbert Ross Brown, The Sentimental Novel in America (1940); Arthur Snerbo, English Sentimental Drama (1957); R. P. Utter and G. B. Needham, Pamela's Daughters (1963); R. S. Crane, \"Suggestions toward a Genealogy of the 'Man of Feeling/ \" in The Idea of the Humanities (2 vols., 1967); Janet Todd, Sensibility: An Introduc\u00ad tion (1986); Discourse: Community Late Eighteenth-Century Scotland (1987); John Mullan, Sentiment and Sociability: The Language of Feeling in the Eighteenth Century (1988); Claude Rawson, Satire and Sentiment 1660-1830 (1994); Jerome McGann, The Poetics of Sensibility (1996). Sentimentalism is now a pejorative term applied to what is perceived to be an excess of emotion to an occasion, and especially to an overindulgence in the \"tender\" emotions of pathos and sympathy. Since what constitutes emo\u00ad tional excess or overindulgence is relative both to the judgment of the indi\u00ad vidual and to large-scale historical changes in culture and in literary fashion, what to the common reader of one age is a normal expression of humane feel\u00ad ing may seem sentimental to many later readers. The emotional responses of a lover that Shelley expresses and tries to evoke from the reader in his \"Epipsychidion\" (1821) seemed sentimental to the New Critics of the 1930s and later, who insisted on the need for an ironic counterpoise to intense feel\u00ad ing in poetry. Most readers now find both the drama of sensibility and the novel of sensibility of the eighteenth century ludicrously sentimental, and respond with jeers instead of tears to once celebrated episodes of pathos, such as many of the death scenes, especially those of children, in some Victorian novels and dramas. A staple in current anthologies of bad poetry are sentimental poems which were no doubt written, and by some people read, with deep and sin\u00ad cere feeling. A useful distinction between sentimental and nonsentimental is one which does not depend on the intensity or type of the feeling expressed or evoked, but labels as sentimental a work or passage in which the feeling is rendered in commonplaces and clich\u00e9s, instead of being freshly verbalized and sharply realized in the details of the representation. See pathos, and sensibility, literature of, and refer to I. A. Richards, Practical Criticism (1929), chapter 6; Laurence Lerner, \"A Note on Sentimentality,\" The Truest Poetry (1960); and the discussion of sentimentality by Monroe C. Beard- sley, \"Bad Poetry,\" in The Possibility of Criticism (1970). Setting. The overall setting of a narrative or dramatic work is the general lo\u00ad cale, historical time, and social circumstances in which its action occurs; the setting of a single episode or scene within such a work is the particular physi\u00ad cal location in which it takes place. The overall setting of Macbeth, for example, SEVEN DEADLY SINS 285 is medieval Scotland, and the setting for the particular scene in which Macbeth comes upon the witches is a blasted heath. The overall setting of James Joyce's Ulysses is Dublin on June 16, 1904, and its opening episode is set in the Martello Tower overlooking Dublin Bay. In works by writers such as Edgar Allan Poe, Thomas Hardy, and William Faulkner, both the overall and individ\u00ad ual settings are important elements in generating the atmosphere of their works. The Greek term opsis (\"scene,\" or \"spectacle\") is now occasionally used to denote a particular visible or picturable setting in any work of literature, in\u00ad cluding a lyric poem. When applied to a theatrical production, \"setting\" is synonymous with d\u00e9cor, which is a French term denoting both the scenery and the properties, or movable pieces of furniture, on the stage. The French mise en sc\u00e8ne (\"plac\u00ad ing on stage\") is sometimes used in English synonymously with \"setting\"; it is more useful, however, to apply the term more broadly, as th\u00e8 French do, to signify a director's overall conception, staging, and directing of a theatrical performance. Seven Deadly Sins. In medieval and later Christian theology these sins were usually identified as Pride, Covetousness, Lust, Envy, Gluttony, Anger, and Sloth. They were called \"deadly\" because they were considered to put the soul of anyone manifesting them in peril of eternal perdition; such sins could be expiated only by absolute penitence. Among them, Pride was often consid\u00ad ered primary, since it was believed to have motivated the original fall of Satan in heaven. Sloth was accounted a deadly sin because it signified not simply laziness, but a torpid and despondent spiritual condition that threatened to make a person despair of any chance of achieving divine Grace. Alternative names for sloth were accidie, \"dejection,\" and \"spiritual dryness\"; it was a condition close to that which present-day psychiatrists diagnose as acute de\u00ad pression. The seven deadly sins (or in an alternative term, cardinal sins) were de\u00ad fined and discussed at length by such major theologians as Gregory the Great and Thomas Aquinas, and served as the topic of countless sermons. They also played an important role in many works of medieval and Renaissance litera\u00ad ture\u2014sometimes in elaborately developed personifications\u2014including Faerie Queene (Book I, Canto 4). Refer to Morton W Bloomfield, The Seven Deadly Sins (1952). The seven deadly sins were balanced by the seven cardinal virtues. Three of these, called the \"theological virtues\" because they were stressed in the New Testament, were Faith, Hope, and Charity (that is, Love)\u2014see St. Paul's J Corinthians 13:13: \"And now abideth faith, hope, and charity, these three.\" The other four, the \"natural virtues,\" were derived from the moral phi\u00ad losophy of the ancient Greeks: justice, prudence, temperance, and fortitude. Refer to Robert W. Ackerman, Backgrounds to Medieval English Literature (1966). 286 SHORT STORY Short Story. A short story is a brief work of prose fiction, and most of the terms for analyzing the component elements, the types, and the various nar\u00ad rative techniques of the novel are applicable to the short story as well. The short story differs from the anecdote\u2014the unelaborated narration of a single incident\u2014in that, like the novel, it organizes the action, thought, and dia\u00ad logue of its characters into the artful pattern of a plot. (See nanative and - tology.) And as in the novel, the plot form may be comic, tragic, romantic, or satiric; the story is presented to us from one of many available points of view; and it may be written in the mode of fantasy, realism, or naturalism. In the tale, or \"story of incident,\" the focus of interest is on the course and outcome of the events, as in Edgar Allan Poe's The Gold Bug (1843) and in other tales of detection, in many of the stories of O. Henry (1862-1910), and in the stock but sometimes well-contrived western and adventure stories in popular magazines. \"Stories of character\" focus instead on the state of mind and motivation, or on the psychological and moral qualities, of the protago\u00ad nists. In some of the stories of character by Anton Chekhov (1860-1904), the Russian master of the form, nothing more happens than an encounter and conversation between two people. Ernest Hemingway's classic \"A Clean, Well- Lighted Place\" consists only of a curt conversation between two waiters about an old man who each day gets drunk and stays on in the caf\u00e9 until it closes, followed by a brief meditation on the part of one of the waiters. In some sto\u00ad ries there is a balance of interest between external action and character. Hem\u00ad ingway's \"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\" is as violent in its packed events as any sensational adventure-tale, but every particular of the action and dialogue is contrived to test and reveal, with a surprising set of re\u00ad versals, the moral quality of all three protagonists. The short story differs from the novel in the dimension that Aristotle called \"magnitude,\" and this limitation of length imposes differences both in the effects that the story can achieve and in the choice, elaboration, and man\u00ad agement of the elements to achieve those effects. Edgar Allan Poe, who is sometimes called the originator of the short story as an established genre, was at any rate its first critical theorist. He defined what he called \"the prose tale\" as a narrative which can be read at one sitting of from half an hour to two hours, and is limited to \"a certain unique or single effect\" to which every de\u00ad tail is subordinate (Review of Nathaniel Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales, 1842). Poe's comment applies to many short stories, and points to the economy of management which the tightness of the form always imposes in some degree. We can say that, by and large, the short story writer introduces a very limited number of persons, cannot afford the space for the leisurely analysis and sus\u00ad tained development of character, and cannot undertake to develop as dense and detailed a social milieu as does the novelist. The author often begins the story close to, or even on the verge of, the climax, minimizes both prior ex\u00ad position and the details of the setting, keeps the complications down, and clears up the denouement quickly\u2014sometimes in a few sentences. (See plot) The central incident is often selected to manifest as much as possible of the protagonist's life and character, and the details are devised to carry maximum SHORT STORY import for the development of the plot. This spareness in the narrative often gives the artistry in a good short story higher visibility than the artistry in the more capacious and loosely structured novel. Many distinguished short stories depart from this paradigm in various ways. It must be remembered that the name covers a great diversity of prose fiction, all the way from the short short story, which is a slightly elaborated anecdote of perhaps five hundred words, to such long and complex forms as Herman Melville's Billy Budd (c. 1890), Henry James' The Turn of the Screw (1898), Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1902), and Thomas Mann's Mano and the Magician (1930). In such works, the status of middle length between the tautness of the short story and the expansiveness of the novel is some\u00ad times indicated by the name novelette, or novella. This form has been espe\u00ad cially exploited in Germany (where it is called the Novelle) after it was introduced by Goethe in 1795 and carried on by Heinrich von Kleist and many other writers; the genre has also been the subject of special critical at\u00ad tention by German theorists (see the list of readings below). The short narrative, in both verse and prose, is one of the oldest and most widespread of literary forms; the Hebrew Bible, for example, includes the sto\u00ad ries of Jonah, Ruth, and Esther. Some of the narrative types which preceded the modern short story, treated elsewhere in this Glossary, are the fable, the exemplum, the folktale, the fabliau, and the parable. Early in its history, there developed the device of the frame-story: a preliminary narrative within which one or more of the characters proceeds to tell a series of short narra\u00ad tives. This device was widespread in the oral and written literature of the East and Middle East, as in the collection of stories called The Arabian Nights, and was used by a number of other writers, including Boccaccio for his prose De\u00ad cameron (1353) and by Chaucer for his versified Canterbury Tales (c. 1387). In the latter instance, Chaucer developed the frame-story of the journey, dia\u00ad logue, and interactions of the Canterbury pilgrims to such a degree that the frame itself approximated the form of an organized plot. Within Chaucer's frame-plot, each story constitutes a complete and rounded narrative, yet functions also both as a means of characterizing the teller and as a vehicle for the quarrels and topics of argument en route. In its more recent forms, the frame-story may enclose either a single narrative (Henry James' The Turn of the Saew) or a sequence of narratives (Joel Chandler Harris' stories as told by Uncle Remus, 1881 and later; see under beast fable). The form of prose narrative which approximates the present concept of the short story was developed, beginning in the early nineteenth century, in order to satisfy the need for short fiction by the many magazines (periodical collections of diverse materials, including essays, reviews, verses, and prose stories) that were inaugurated at that time. Among the early practitioners were Washington Irving, Hawthorne, and Poe in America, Sir Walter Scott and Mary Shelley in England, E. T. A. Hoffmann in Germany, Balzac in France, and Gogol, Pushkin, and Turgenev in Russia. Since then, almost all the major novelists in all the European languages have also written notable short sto\u00ad ries. The form has flourished especially in America; Frank O'Connor has 288 SOCIALIST REALISM \u00b7 SOCIOLOGY OF LITERATURE called it \"the national art form,\" and its American masters include (in addi\u00ad tion to the writers mentioned above) Mark Twain, William Faulkner, Kather\u00ad ine Anne Porter, Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, John O'Hara, J. F. Powers, John Cheever, and J. D. Salinger. See H. S. Canby, The Short Story in English (1909); Sean O'Faolain, The Short Story (1948, reprinted 1964); Frank O'Connor, The Lonely Voice: A Study of the Short Story (1962); R. L. Pattee, The Development of the American Short Story (rev. 1966); Julie Brown, ed., American Women Short Story Writers (1995).

Socialist Realism was a term used by Marxist critics for novels which, they claimed, reflected social reality\u2014that is, novels that accorded with the Marx\u00ad ist view that the struggle between economic classes is the essential dynamic of society. After the 1930s, \"Socialist Realism\" was the officially sanctioned artis\u00ad tic mode for communist writers until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. In its crude version, it served as a term of approbation applied to novels that adhered to the party line by stressing the oppression of workers by bour\u00ad geois capitalists, the virtues of the proletariat, and the felicities of life under a communist regime. A flexible Marxist critic such as Georg Luk\u00e1cs, on the other hand, applied complex criteria of narrative realism to laud the tradi\u00ad tional classics of European realistic fiction. See Marxist criticism and realism, and refer to Georg Luk\u00e1cs, Studies in Eu\u00ad ropean Realism (trans., Soviet Russian Literature (1967); and George Bisztray, Marxist Models of Literary Realism (1978). Sociology of Literature. Most literary historians and critics have taken some account of the relation of individual authors to the circumstances of the social and cultural era in which they live and write, as well as of the relation of a literary work to the segment of society that its fiction represents or to which the work is addressed. (For major exceptions in recent types of criti\u00ad cism see Russian formalism, New Criticism, structuralism, deconstruction.) The term \"sociology of literature,\" however, is applied only to the writings of those historians and critics whose primary, and sometimes exclusive, interest is in the ways that the constitution and form of a literary work are affected by such circumstances as its author's class status, gender, and political and other interests; the ways of thinking and feeling characteristic of its era; the eco\u00ad nomic conditions of the writer's profession and of the publication and distri\u00ad bution of books; and the social class, conceptions, and values of the audience to which an author addresses the literary product, or to which it is made avail\u00ad able. Sociological critics treat a work of literature as inescapably condi\u00ad tioned\u2014in the choice and development of its subject matter, the ways of thinking it incorporates, its evaluations of the modes of life it renders, and SOLILOQUY 289 even in its formal qualities\u2014by the social, political, and economic organiza\u00ad tion and forces of its age. Such critics also tend to view the interpretation and assessment of a literary work by a reading public as shaped by the circum\u00ad stances specific to that public's time and place. The French historian Hip- polyte Taine is sometimes considered the first modern sociologist of literature in his History of English Literature (1863), which analyzed a work as largely ex\u00ad plicable by reference to three factors: its and so\u00ad cial \"milieu,\" and historical \"moment.\" For prominent sociological emphases in recent critical writings, see femi\u00ad nist criticism\u2014which emphasizes the role of male interests and assumptions as determinants of literary content, form, values, and interpretations\u2014and also Marxist criticism. It should be noted that Marx's view of the economic basis of social organization, class ideologies, and class conflict have influenced the work of many critics who, although not committed to Marxist doctrine, stress the sociological context and content of works of literature. The most thor\u00ad oughgoing treatments of literary works as cultural products that are totally embedded in the contextual circumstances of a time and place are by adher\u00ad ents of the current modes of criticism classified as the new historicism. See the readings listed under authors and authorship, feminist criticism, Marxist criticism, and new historicism. Refer also to the pioneering study by Alexandre Beljame, Men of Letters and the English Public\u2014i.e., in the eighteenth century (1883, trans. 1948); Levin Schucking, The Sociology of Literary Taste (rev. 1941); Harry Levin, \"Literature as an Institution,\" in The Gates of Horn (1963); Hugh Dalziel Duncan, Language and Literature in Society, with a Biblio\u00ad graphical Guide to the Sociology of Literature (1953); Pierre Bourdieu, The Field of Cultural Production: Essays in Art and Literature (1996). Collections of essays in sociological criticism include Joseph P. Strelka, ed., Literary Criticism and Soci\u00ad ology (1973); Elizabeth and Tom Burns, eds., Sociology of Literature and Drama: Selected Readings (1973); and the issue of Critical Inquiry devoted to the sociol\u00ad ogy of literature, Vol. 14 (Spring, 1988). Soliloquy is the act of talking to oneself, whether silently or aloud. In drama it denotes the convention by which a character, alone on the stage, ut\u00ad ters his or her thoughts aloud. Playwrights have used this device as a conven\u00ad ient way to convey information about a character's motives and state of mind, or for purposes of exposition, and sometimes in order to guide the judgments and responses of the audience. Christopher Marlowe's Dr. Faustus (first performed in 1594) opens with a long expository soliloquy, and con\u00ad cludes with another which expresses Faustus' frantic mental and emotional condition during his belated attempts to escape damnation. The best-known of all dramatic soliloquies is Hamlet's speech which begins \"To be or not to be.\" (Compare monologue.) A related stage device is the aside, in which a character expresses to the audience his or her thought or intention in a short speech which, by conven\u00ad tion, is inaudible to the other characters on the stage. Both devices, common in Elizabethan and later drama, fell into disuse in the later nineteenth century, 290 SONNET when the increasing requirement that plays convey the illusion of real life im\u00ad pelled dramatists to exploit indirect means for conveying exposition and guid\u00ad ance to the audience. Eugene O'Neill, however, revived and extended the aside and made it a central device throughout his play Strange Interlude (1928). Sonnet. A lyric poem consisting of a single stanza of fourteen iambic pen\u00ad tameter lines linked by an intricate rhyme scheme. There are two major pat\u00ad terns of rhyme in sonnets written in the English language: (1) The Italian or Petrarchan sonnet (named after the fourteenth- century Italian poet Petrarch) falls into two main parts: an octave (eight lines) rhyming abbaabba followed by a sestet (six lines) rhyming cdecde or some variant, such as cdccdc. Petrarch's sonnets were first imitated in England, both in their stanza form and their subject\u2014the hopes and pains of an adoring male lover\u2014by Sir Thomas Wyatt in the early sixteenth century. (See Petrarchan conceit.) The Petrarchan form was later used, and for a variety of subjects, by Milton, Wordsworth, Christina Rossetti, D. G. Rossetti, and other sonneteers, who sometimes made it technically easier in English (which does not have as many rhyming possibilities as Italian) by in\u00ad troducing a new pair of rhymes in the second four lines of the octave. (2) The Earl of Surrey and other English experimenters in the sixteenth century also developed a stanza form called the English sonnet, or else the Shakespearean sonnet, after its greatest practitioner. This sonnet falls into three quatrains and a concluding couplet: abab cdcd efef gg. There was one notable variant, the Spenserian sonnet, in which Spenser linked each quatrain to the next by a continuing rhyme: abab bebe cdcd ee. John Donne shifted from the hitherto standard subject, sexual love, to a variety of religious themes in his Holy Sonnets, written early in the seventeenth century; and Milton, in the latter part of that century, expanded the range of the sonnet to other matters of seri\u00ad ous concern. Except for a lapse in the English Neoclassic Period, the sonnet has remained a popular form to the present day and includes among its distinguished practitioners, in the nineteenth century, Wordsworth, Keats, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and more recently Edwin Arlington Robinson, Edna St. Vincent Millay, W. B. Yeats, Robert Frost, W. H. Auden, and Dylan Thomas. The stanza is just long enough to permit a fairly complex lyric development, yet so short and so exigent in its rhymes as to pose a standing challenge to the artistry of the poet. The rhyme pattern of the Petrarchan sonnet has on the whole fa\u00ad vored a statement of problem, situation, or incident in the octave, with a resolution in the sestet. The English form sometimes uses a similar division of material, but often presents a repetition-with- variation of a statement in each of the three quatrains; in either case, SPEECH-ACT THEORY the final couplet in the English sonnet usually imposes an epigram\u00ad matic turn at the end. In Drayton's fine Elizabethan sonnet in the English form \"Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part,\" the lover brusquely declares in the first quatrain, then reiterates in the second, that he is glad that the affair is cleanly ended, but in the concluding couplet suddenly drops his swagger to make one last plea. Here are the last quatrain and couplet: Now at the last gasp of love's latest breath, When, his pulse failing, passion speechless lies, When faith is kneeling by his bed of death, And innocence is closing up his eyes; Now if thou wouldst, when all have given him over, From death to life thou mightst him yet recover. Following Petrarch's early example, a number of Elizabethan authors arranged their poems into sonnet sequences, or sonnet cycles, in which a series of sonnets are linked together by exploring the varied aspects of a rela\u00ad tionship between lovers, or else by indicating a development in the relation\u00ad ship that constitutes a kind of implicit plot. Shakespeare ordered his sonnets in a sequence, as did Sidney in Astrophel and Stella (1580) and Spenser in Amoretti (1595). Later examples of the sonnet sequence on various subjects are Wordsworth's The River Duddon, D. G. Rossetti's House of Life, Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Sonnets from the Portuguese, and the American poet William Ellery Leonard's Two Lives. Dylan Thomas' Altarwise by Owl-light (1936) is a sequence of ten sonnets which are meditations on the poet's own life. George Mere\u00ad dith's Modern Love (1862), which concerns a bitterly unhappy marriage, is sometimes called a sonnet sequence, even though its poems consist not of fourteen but of sixteen lines. On the early history of the sonnet and its development in England through Milton, see Michael R. G. Spiller, The Development of the Sonnet: An In\u00ad troduction (1992). See also L. G. Sterner, The Sonnet in American Literature (1930); J. B. Leishman, Themes and Variations in Shakespeare's Sonnets (1963); Michael R. G. Spiller, The Sonnet Sequence: A Study of the Strategies (1997); Helen Vendler, The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets (1997). Arthur Marotti relates the vogue of the sonnet sequences to the politics and system of literary pa\u00ad tronage in Elizabethan England, in \"Love Is Se\u00ad and the Social Order,\" ELH, Vol. 49 (1982). Speech-Act Theory, developed by the philosopher John Austin, was de\u00ad scribed most fully in his posthumous book How to Do Things with Words (1962), and was explored and expanded by other \"ordinary-language philoso\u00ad phers,\" including John Searle and H. P. Grice. Austin's theory is directed against traditional tendencies of philosophers (1) to analyze the meaning of isolated sentences, abstracted from the context of a discourse and from the at\u00ad tendant circumstances in which a sentence is uttered; and (2) to assume, in what Austin describes as a logical obsession, that the standard sentence\u2014of 292 SPEECH-ACT THEORY which other types are merely variants\u2014is a statement that describes a situa\u00ad tion or asserts a fact and can be judged to be either true or false. John Searle's adoption and elaboration of Austin's speech-act theory opposes to these views the claim that when we attend to the overall linguistic and situational con\u00ad text\u2014including the institutional conditions that govern many uses of lan\u00ad guage\u2014we find that in speaking or writing we perform simultaneously three, and sometimes four, distinguishable kinds of speech acts: (1) We utter a sentence; Austin called this act a \"locution.\" (2) We refer to an object, and predicate something about that object. (3) We perform an illocutionary act. (4) Often, we also perform a perlocutionary act. The illocutionary act performed by a locution may indeed be the one stressed by traditional philosophy and logic, to assert that something is true, but it may instead be one of very many other possible speech acts, such as questioning, commanding, promising, warning, praising, thanking, and so on. A sentence consisting of the same words in the same grammatical form, such as \"I will leave you tomorrow,\" may in a particular verbal and situational context turn out to have the \"illocutionary force\" either of an assertion, a promise, or a threat. In an illocutionary act that is not an assertion, the prime criterion (although the utterance may make reference to some state of affairs) is not its truth or falsity, but whether or not the act has been performed suc\u00ad cessfully, or in Austin's term, \"felicitously.\" A felicitous performance of a par\u00ad ticular illocutionary act depends on its meeting \"appropriateness conditions\" which obtain for that type of act; these conditions are tacit linguistic and so\u00ad cial (or institutional) conventions, or rules, that are shared by competent speakers and interpreters of a language. For example, the successful perform\u00ad ance of an illocutionary act of promising, such as \"I will come to see you to\u00ad morrow,\" depends on its meeting its special set of appropriateness conditions: the speaker must be capable of fulfilling his promise, must intend to do so, and must believe that the listener wants him to do so. Failing the last condi\u00ad tion, for example, the same verbal utterance might have the illocutionary force of a threat. In How to Do Things with Words, John Austin established an initial distinc\u00ad tion between two broad types of locutions: constatives (sentences that assert something about a fact or state of affairs and are adjudged to be true or false) and performatives (sentences that are actions which accomplish something, such as questioning, promising, praising, and so on). As he continued his sub\u00ad tle analysis, however, Austin showed that this initial division of utterances into two sharply exclusive classes does not hold, in that many performatives also involve reference to a state of affairs, while constatives also perform an illocu\u00ad tionary action. Austin, however, drew special attention to the \"explicit perfor\u00ad mative,\" which is a sentence whose utterance itself, when executed under appropriate institutional and other conditions, brings about the state of affairs that it signifies. Examples are \"I name this ship the Queen Elizabeth\"; \"I apol\u00ad ogize\"; call this spades be trumps.\" If an illocutionary act has an effect on the actions or state of mind of the hearer which goes beyond merely understanding what has been said, it is also SPEECH-ACT THEORY a perlocutionary act. Thus, the utterance \"I am going to leave you,\" with the illocutionary force of a warning, may not only be understood as such, but have (or fail to have) the additional perlocutionary effect of frightening the hearer. Similarly, by the illocutionary act of promising to do something, one may please (or else anger) the hearer; and by asserting something, one may have the effect either of enlightening, or of inspiring, or of intimidating the hearer. Some perlocutionary effects may be intended by the speaker; others occur without the speaker's intention, and even against that intention. For a useful exploration of the relations, in diverse cases, of illocutionary and per\u00ad locutionary speech acts, see Ted Cohen, \"Illocutions and Perlocutions,\" in Foundations of Language 9 (1973). A number of deconstructive theorists have proposed that the use of lan\u00ad guage in fictional literature (which Austin had excluded from his considera\u00ad tion of \"seriously\" intended speech-acts) is in fact a prime instance of the performative, in that it does not refer to a pre-existing state of affairs, but brings about, or brings into being, the characters, action, and world that it de\u00ad scribes. On the other hand, since performative linguistic acts can't avoid re\u00ad course to the language of statement and assertion, deconstructive theorists convert Austin's constative/performative distinction into an undecidable deadlock, or oscillation, of irreconcilable oppositions. See deconstruction and refer to Barbara Johnson, \"Poetry and Performative Language: Mallarm\u00e9 and Austin,\" in The Critical Difference (1980); Sandra Petrey, Speech Acts and Literary Theory (1990); Jonathan Culler, Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction (1997), chapter 7, \"Performative Language.\" Judith Butler has proposed that the terms we use to describe gender and sexuality are modes of the performa\u00ad tive use of language, in that the reiterated application of such terms, in accor\u00ad dance with conventions that govern their use, in fact bring about (or \"perform\") the identities and modes of behavior that they purport to de\u00ad scribe. See Judith Butler, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (1990) and Excitable Speech (1997); also refer to Queer Theory. Since 1970 speech-act theory has influenced in conspicuous and varied ways the practice of literary criticism. When applied to the analysis of direct discourse by a character within a literary work, it provides a systematic but sometimes cumbersome framework for identifying the unspoken presupposi\u00ad tions, implications, and effects of speech acts which competent readers and critics have always taken into account, subtly though unsystematically. (See discourse analysis.) Speech-act theory has also been used in a more radical way, however, as a model on which to recast the theory of literature in general, and especially the theory of prose narratives (see fiction and truth). What the au\u00ad thor of a fictional work\u2014or else what the author's invented narrator\u2014nar\u00ad rates is held to constitute a \"pretended\" set of assertions, which are intended by the author, and understood by the competent reader, to be free from a speaker's ordinary commitment to the truth of what he or she asserts. Within the frame of the fictional world that the narrative thus sets up, however, the utterances of the fictional characters\u2014whether these are assertions or prom\u00ad ises or marital vows\u2014are held to be responsible to ordinary illocutionary 294 STANZA commitments. Alternatively, some speech-act theorists propose a new version of mimetic theory (see imitation). Traditional mimetic critics had claimed that literature imitates reality by representing in a verbal medium the setting, ac\u00ad tions, utterances, and interactions of human beings. Some speech-act theo\u00ad rists, on the other hand, propose that all literature is simply \"mimetic discourse.\" A lyric, for example, is an imitation of that form of ordinary dis\u00ad course in which we express our feelings about something, and a novel is an imitation of a particular form of written discourse, such as biography (Henry Fielding's The History of Tom Jones, 1749), or autobiography (Charles Dickens' David Copperfield, 1849-50), or even a scholar's annotated edition of a poetic text (Nabokov's Pale Fire, 1962). See Barbara Hernstein Smith, On the Margins of Discourse: The Relation of Literature to Language (1978). For basic philosophical treatments of speech acts see John Austin's How to Do Things with Words (1962); John R. Searle's Speech Acts: An Essay in the Phi\u00ad losophy of Language (1970); and H. P. Grice, \"Logic and Conversation,\" in Syn\u00ad tax and Semantics 3 (1975). Among the attempts to model the general theory of literature, or at least of prose fiction, on the theory of speech acts are Richard Ohmann, \"Speech Acts and the Definition of Literature,\" Philosophy and Rhetoric 4 (1971); Charles Altieri, \"The Poem as Act,\" Iowa Review 6 (1975); John R. Searle, \"The Logical Status of Fictional Discourse,\" in his Expression and Meaning (1979), chapter 3. A detailed application to literary theory is Mary Louise Pratt's Toward a Speech Act Theory of Literary Discourse (1977). For views of the limitations of speech-act theory when applied in literary criti\u00ad cism, see Stanley Fish, \"How to Do Things with Austin and Searle: Speech-Act Theory and Literary Criticism,\" in Is There a Text in This Class? (1980); and Joseph Margolis, \"Literature and Speech Acts,\" Philosophy and Literature 3 (1979). For Jacques Derrida's deconstructive analysis of Austin's views, and John Searle's reply, see under deconstruction. Stanza. A stanza (Italian for \"stopping place\") is a grouping of the verse- lines in a poem, often set off by a space in the printed text. Usually the stan\u00ad zas of a given poem are marked by a recurrent pattern of rhyme and are also uniform in the number and lengths of the component lines. Some unrhymed poems, however, are divided into stanzaic units (for example, William Collins' \"Ode to Evening,\" 1747), and some rhymed poems are composed of stanzas that vary in their component lines (for example, the inegular ode). Of the great diversity of English stanza forms, many have no special names and must be described by specifying the number of lines, the type and number of metric feet in each line, and the pattern of the rhyme. Certain stan\u00ad zas, however, occur so often that they have been given the convenience of a name. Some literary scholars apply the term \"stanza\" only to divisions of four or more lines. This entry, however, follows a widespread application of the term also to divisions of two and three lines. A couplet is a pair of rhymed lines that are equal in length. The octosyl\u00ad labic couplet has lines of eight syllables, usually consisting of four iambic feet, as in Andrew Marvell's \"To His Coy Mistress\" (1681): STANZA 295 The grave's a fine and private place, But none, I think, do there embrace. Iambic pentameter lines rhyming in pairs are called decasyllabic (\"ten- syllable\") couplets or \"heroic couplets.\" (For examples, see heroic couplet.) The tercet, or triplet, is a stanza of three lines, usually with a single rhyme. The lines may be the same length (as in Robert Herrick's \"Upon Julia's Clothes,\" 1648, written in tercets of iambic or else of varying lengths. In Richard Crashaw's \"Wishes to His Supposed Mistress\" (1646), the lines of each tercet are successively in iambic dimeter, trimeter, and tetrameter: Who e'er she be That not impossible she That shall command my heart and me. Terza rima is composed of tercets which are interlinked, in that each is joined to the one following by a common rhyme: aba, beb, ede, and so on. Dante composed his Divine Comedy (early fourteenth century) in terza rima; but although Sir Thomas Wyatt introduced the form early in the sixteenth century, it has not been a common meter in English, in which rhymes are much harder to find than in Italian. Shelley, however, used it brilliantly in \"Ode to the West Wind\" (1820), and it occurs also in the poetry of Milton, Browning, and T. S. Eliot. The quatrain, or four-line stanza, is the most common in English versifi\u00ad cation, and is employed with various meters and rhyme schemes. The ballad stanza (in alternating four- and three-foot lines rhyming abeb, or less fre\u00ad quently abab) is one common quatrain; when this same stanza occurs in hymns, it is called common measure. Emily Dickinson is the most subtle, var\u00ad ied, and persistent of all users of this type of quatrain; her frequent use of slant rhyme prevents monotony: Purple\u2014is fashionable twice\u2014 This season of the year, And when a soul perceives itself To be an Emperor. The heroic quatrain, in iambic pentameter rhyming abab, is the stanza of Gray's \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\" (1751): The curfew tolls the knell of parting day, The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea, The plowman homeward plods his weary way, And leaves the world to darkness, and to one. Rime royal was introduced by Chaucer in Troilus and Criseyde (the latter 1380s) and other narrative poems; it is believed to take its name, however, from its later use by \"the Scottish Chaucerian,\" King James I of Scotland, in his poem The Kingis Quair (\"The King's Book\"), written about 1424. It is a seven-line, iambic pentameter stanza rhyming ababbec. This form was quite widely used by Elizabethan poets, including by Shakespeare in \"A Lover's Complaint\" and The Rape of Lucr\u00e8ce, which begins: 296 STANZA From the besieged \u00c1rdea all in post, Borne by the trustless wings of false desire, Lust-breath\u00e8d Tarqu\u00edn leaves the Roman host And to Collatium bears the lightless fire Which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire And girdle with embracing flames the waist Of Collatine's fair love, Lucr\u00e8ce the chaste. Ottava rima, as the Italian name indicates, has eight lines; it rhymes abababcc. Like terza rima and the sonnet, it was brought from Italian into English by Sir Thomas Wyatt in the first half of the sixteenth century. Al\u00ad though employed by a number of earlier poets, it is notable especially as the stanza which helped Byron discover what he was born to write, the satiric poem Don Juan (1819-24). Note the comic effect of the forced rhyme in the concluding couplet: Juan was taught from out the best edition, Expurgated by learned men, who place, Judiciously, from out the schoolboy's vision, The grosser parts; but, fearful to deface Too much their modest bard by this omission, And pitying sore his mutilated case, They only add them all in an appendix, Which saves, in fact, the trouble of an index. Spenserian stanza is a still longer form devised by Edmund Spenser for The Faerie Queene (1590-96)\u2014nine lines, in which the first eight lines are iambic pentameter and the last iambic hexameter (an Alexandrine), rhyming ababbcbcc. Enchanted by Spenser's gracious movement and music, many poets have attempted the stanza in spite of its difficulties. Its greatest suc\u00ad cesses have been in poems which, like The Faerie Queene, evolve in a leisurely way, with ample time for unrolling the richly textured stanzas; for example, James Thomson's \"The Castle of Indolence\" (1748), Bysshe Shelley's \"Adonais\" (1821), and the of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's \"The Lotus Eaters\" (1832). The following is a Spenser's Faerie Queene 1.1.41: And more, to lulle him in his slumber soft, A trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe And ever-drizling raine upon the loft Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne: No other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes, As still wont in eternali silence farre from enemyes. There are also various elaborate stanza forms imported from France, such as the rondeau, the villanelle, and the triolet, containing intricate repetitions both of rhymes and of entire lines, which have been used mainly, but not ex\u00ad clusively, for light verse. Their revival by W. H. Auden, William Empson, and STOCK CHARACTERS 297 other mid-twentieth-century poets was a sign of renewed interest in high metrical artifice. Dylan Thomas' \"Do not go gentle into that good night\" is a villanelle; that is, it consists of five tercets and a quatrain, all on two rhymes, and with systematic later repetitions of lines 1 and 3 of the first tercet. One of the most intricate of poetic forms is the sestina: a poem of six six- line stanzas in which the end-words in the lines of the first stanza are re\u00ad peated, in a set order of variation, as the end-words of the stanzas that follow. The sestina concludes with a three-line envoy which incorporates, in the mid\u00ad dle and at the end of the lines, all six of these end words. (An envoy, or \"send- off,\" is a short formal stanza which is appended to a poem by way of conclusion.) This form, introduced in the twelfth century, was cultivated by Italian, Spanish, and French poets. Despite its extreme difficulty, the sestina has also been managed with success by the Elizabethan Sir Philip Sidney, the Victorian Algernon Swinburne, and the modern poets W. H. Auden and John Ashberry. See meter. Poetic forms discussed elsewhere in the Glossary are ballad stanza, blank verse, free verse, heroic couplet, limerick, and sonnet. The form and history of the various stanzas are described and exemplified in R. M. Alden, English Verse (1903), and in Paul Fussell, Poetic Meter and Poetic Form (rev. 1979). Stock Characters are character types that occur repeatedly in a particular literary genre, and so are recognizable as part of the conventions of the form. The Old Comedy of the Greeks had three stock characters whose interactions constituted the standard plot: the alazon, or impostor and self-deceiving braggart; the eiron, or self-derogatory and understating character, whose con\u00ad test with the alazon is central to the comic plot; and the bomolochos, buffoon, whose antics add an extra comic element. (See Lane Cooper, An Aris\u00ad totelian Theory of Comedy, 1922.) In his Anatomy of Criticism (1957), Northrop Frye revived these old terms, added a fourth, the agroikos\u2014the rustic or eas\u00ad ily deceived character\u2014and identified the persistence of these types (very broadly defined) in comic plots up to our own time. The Italian commedia dell'arte revolved around such stock characters as Pulcinella and Pantaloon; see commedia dell'arte. The plot of an Elizabethan romantic comedy, such as Shakespeare's As You Like It and Twelfth Night, often turned on a heroine disguised as a handsome young man; and a stock figure in the Elizabethan comedy of intrigue was the clever servant who, like Mosca in Ben Jonson's Volpone, connives with his master to fleece another stock character, the stupid gull. Nineteenth-century comedy, on stage and in fiction, exploited the stock Englishman with a mon\u00ad ocle, an exaggerated Oxford accent, and a defective sense of humor. Western stories and films generated the tight-lipped sheriff who lets his gun do the talking; while a familiar figure in the fiction of the recent past was the stoical Hemingway hero, unillusioned but faithful to his primal code of honor and loyalty in a civilization grown effete and corrupt. The Beat or hipster or alien\u00ad ated protagonist who, with or without the help of drugs, has opted out of the Establishment is an even more recent stock character. 298 STOCK RESPONSE \u00b7 STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS In some literary forms, such as morality play and Ben Jonson's comedy of humours, the artistic aim does not require more than type-characters. (See also flat character, under character and characterization.) But even in realistic literary forms, the artistic success of a protagonist does not depend on whether or not an author incorporates an established type, but on how well the type is recre\u00ad ated as a convincing individual who fulfills his or her function in the overall plot. Two of Shakespeare's greatest characters are patently conventional. Fal\u00ad staff is in part a rerendering of the Vice, the comic tempter of the medieval morality play, and in part of the familiar braggart soldier, or miles gloriosus, of Roman and Renaissance comedy, whose ancestry goes back to the Greek alazon; and Hamlet combines some stock attributes of the hero of Elizabethan revenge tragedies with those of the Elizabethan melancholic man. Jane Austen's delightful Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice (1813) can be traced back through Restoration comedy to the type of intelligent, witty, and dauntless heroines in Shakespeare's romantic comedies. Stock Response. A derogatory term for a reaction thought to be habitual and stereotyped, in place of one which is genuinely and aptly responsive to a given literary passage or text. The term is sometimes applied to the response of authors themselves to characters, situations, or topics that they set forth in a work; usually, however, it is used to describe standard and inadequate re\u00ad sponses of the readers of the work. I. A. Richards, in his Practical Criticism (1929), chapter 5, gave currency to this term by citing and analyzing stock re\u00ad sponses by students who wrote critiques of unidentified poems presented for their interpretation and evaluation. Stock Situations are the counterparts to stock characters; that is, they are often-used types of incidents or of sequences of actions in a drama or narrative. Instances range from single situations\u2014the eavesdropper who is hidden behind a bush or in a closet, or the suddenly discovered will or birthmark\u2014to the overall pattern of a plot. The Horatio Alger books for boys, in mid-nineteenth- century America, were all variations on the stock plot of rags-to-riches-by-pluck- and-luck, and we recognize the standard boy-meets-girl incident in the opening episode of much popular fiction and in many motion pictures. Some recent critics distinguish certain recurrent character types and ele\u00ad ments of plot, such as the sexually irresistible but fatal enchantress, the sacri\u00ad ficial scapegoat, and the underground journey, as \"archetypal\" components which are held to recur, not simply because they are functional literary con\u00ad ventions, but because, like dreams and myths, they express and appeal to universal human impulses, anxieties, and needs. See archetype, and for struc\u00ad turalist analyses of recurrent plot-types, nanative and nanatology. Stream of Consciousness was a phrase used by William James in his Princi\u00ad ples of Psychology (1890) to describe the unbroken flow of perceptions, thoughts, and feelings in the waking mind; it has since been adopted to de\u00ad scribe a narrative method in modern fiction. Long passages of introspection, STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS 299 in which the narrator records in detail what passes through a character's aware\u00ad ness, are found in novelists from Samuel Richardson, through William James' brother Henry James, to many novelists of the present era. The long chapter 42 of James' Portrait of a Lady, for example, is entirely given over to the narrator's description of the process of Isabel's memories, thoughts, and feelings. As early as 1888 a minor French writer, Edouard Du jardin, wrote a short novel Les Lau\u00ad riers sont coup\u00e9s (\"The Laurels Have Been Cut\") which is a rather crude but sus\u00ad tained attempt to represent the scenes and events of the story solely as they impinge upon the consciousness of the central character. As it has been refined since the 1920s, stream of consciousness is the name applied specifically to a mode of narration that undertakes to reproduce, without a narrator's interven\u00ad tion, the full spectrum and continuous flow of a character's mental process, in which sense perceptions mingle with conscious and half-conscious thoughts, memories, expectations, feelings, and random associations. Some critics use \"stream of consciousness\" interchangeably with the term interior monologue. It is useful, however, to follow the usage of critics who use the former as the inclusive term, denoting all the diverse means em\u00ad ployed by authors to communicate the inclusive state and process of con\u00ad sciousness in a character. \"Interior monologue\" is then reserved for that species of stream of consciousness which undertakes to present to the reader the course and rhythm of consciousness precisely as it occurs in a character's mind. In interior monologue the author does not intervene, or at any rate in\u00ad tervenes minimally, as describer, guide, or commentator, and does not tidy the vagaries of the mental process into grammatical sentences or into a logical or coherent order. The interior monologue, in its radical form, is sometimes described as the exact presentation of the process of consciousness; but be\u00ad cause sense perceptions, mental images, feelings, and some aspects of thought itself are nonverbal, it is clear that the author can present these elements only by converting them into some kind of verbal equivalent. Much of this con\u00ad version is a matter of narrative conventions rather than of unedited, point-for- point reproduction, and each author puts his or her own imprint on the interior monologues that are attributed to characters in the narrative. (For the linguistic techniques that have been used to render the states and flow of con\u00ad sciousness, see Dorrit Cohn, Transparent Minds: Nanative Modes for Presenting Consciousness in Fiction, 1978.) James Joyce developed a variety of devices for stream-of-consciousness narrative in Ulysses (1922). Here is a passage of interior monologue from the \"Lestrygonian\" episode, in which Leopold Bloom saunters through Dublin, observing and musing: Pineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch. A sugar-sticky girl shoveling scoopfuls of creams for a christian brother. Some school treat. Bad for their tummies. Lozenge and comfit manufacturer to His Majesty the King. God. Save. Our. Sitting on his throne, sucking red jujubes white. Dorothy Richardson sustains a stream-of-consciousness mode of narrative, fo\u00ad cused exclusively on the mind and perceptions of her heroine, throughout 300 STRUCTURALIST CRITICISM the twelve volumes of her novel Pilgrimage (1915-38); Virginia Woolf employs the procedure as a primary, although not exclusive, narrative mode in several novels, including Mrs. Dalloway (1925) and To the Lighthouse (1927); and William Faulkner exploits it brilliantly in the first three of the four parts of The Sound and the Fury (1929). Refer to nanatology and point of view, and see Leon Edel, The Modern Psy\u00ad chological Novel (1955, rev. 1964); Robert Humphrey, Stream of Consciousness in the Modem Novel (1954); Melvin Friedman, Stream of Consciousness: A Study in Literary Method (1955). Structuralist Criticism. Almost all literary theorists since Aristotle have emphasized the importance of structure, conceived in diverse ways, in analyz\u00ad ing a work of literature. \"Structuralist criticism,\" however, now designates the practice of critics who analyze literature on the explicit model of structuralist linguistics. The class includes a number of Russian formalists, especially Roman Jakobson, but consists most prominently of a group of writers, with their headquarters in Paris, who applied to literature the concepts and ana\u00ad lytic distinctions developed by Ferdinand de Saussure in his Course in General Linguistics (1915). This mode of criticism is part of a larger movement, French structuralism, inaugurated in the 1950s by the cultural anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, who analyzed, on Saussure's linguistic model, such cul\u00ad tural phenomena as mythology, kinship relations, and modes of preparing food. See linguistics in literary criticism. In its early form, as manifested by L\u00e9vi-Strauss and other writers in the 1950s and 1960s, structuralism cuts across the traditional disciplinary areas of the humanities and social sciences by undertaking to provide an objective ac\u00ad count of all social and cultural practices, in a range that includes mythical narratives, literary texts, advertisements, fashions in clothes, and patterns of social decorum. It views these practices as combinations of signs that have a set significance for the members of a particular culture, and undertakes to make explicit the rules and procedures by which the practices have achieved their cultural significance, and to specify what that significance is, by refer\u00ad ence to an underlying system (analogous to Saussure's langue, the implicit sys\u00ad tem of a particular language) of the relationships among signifying elements and their rules of combination. The elementary cultural phenomena, like the linguistic elements in Saussure's exposition, are not objective facts identifi\u00ad able by their inherent properties, but purely \"relational\" entities; that is, their identity as signs are given to them by their relations of differences from, and binary oppositions to, other elements within the cultural system. This system of internal relationships, and of \"codes\" that determine significant combina\u00ad tions, have been mastered by each person competent within a given culture, although he or she remains largely unaware of its nature and operations. The primary interest of the structuralist, like that of Saussure, is not in the cultural parole but in the langue; that is, not in any particular cultural phenomenon or event except as it provides access to the structure, features, and rules of the general system that engenders its significance. STRUCTURALIST CRITICISM As applied in literary studies, structuralist criticism views literature as a second-order signifying system that uses the first-order structural system of language as its medium, and is itself to be analyzed primarily on the model of linguistic theory. Structuralist critics often apply a variety of linguistic con\u00ad cepts to the analysis of a literary text, such as the distinction between phone\u00ad mic and morphemic levels of organization, or between paradigmatic and syntagmatic relationships; and some critics analyze the structure of a literary text on the model of the syntax in a well-formed sentence. The undertaking of a thoroughgoing literary structuralism, however, is to explain how it is that a competent reader is able to make sense of a particular literary text by specify\u00ad ing the underlying system of literary conventions and rules of combination that has been unconsciously mastered by such a reader. The aim of classic lit\u00ad erary structuralism, accordingly, is not (as in New Criticism) to provide inter\u00ad pretations of an individual text, but to make explicit, in a quasi-scientific way, the tacit grammar (the system of rules and codes) that governs the forms and meanings of all literary productions. As Jonathan Culler put it in his lucid ex\u00ad position, the aim of structuralist criticism is \"to construct a poetics which stands to literature as linguistics stands to language\" (Structuralist Poetics, 1975, prominent structuralist critics of literature. Structuralism is in explicit opposition to mimetic criticism (the view that literature is primarily an imitation of reality), to expressive criticism (the view that literature primarily expresses the feelings or temperament or creative imagination of its author), and to any form of the view that literature is a mode of communication between author and readers. More generally, in its attempt to develop a science of literature and in many of its salient concepts, the radical forms of structuralism depart from the assumptions and ruling ideas of traditional humanistic criticism. (See humanism.) For example: (1) In the structuralist view, what had been called a literary \"work\" be\u00ad comes a \"text\"; that is, a mode of writing constituted by a play of component elements according to specifically literary conventions and codes. These factors may generate an illusion of reality, but have no truth-value, nor even any reference to a reality existing outside the literary system itself. (2) The individual author, or subject, is not assigned any initiative, ex\u00ad pressive intentions, or design as the \"origin\" or producer of a work. Instead the conscious \"self\" is declared to be a construct that is itself the product of the workings of the linguistic system, and the mind of an author is described as an imputed \"space\" within which the im\u00ad personal, \"always-already\" existing system of literary language, con\u00ad ventions, codes, and rules of combination gets precipitated into a particular text. Roland Barthes expressed, dramatically, this subver\u00ad sion of the traditional humanistic view, \"As institution, the author is dead\" (\"The Death of the Author,\" in Image-Music-Text, trans. 1977). See author and authorship and poststructuralism. 302 STRUCTURALIST CRITICISM (3) Structuralism replaces the author by the reader as the central agency in criticism; but the traditional reader, as a conscious, purposeful, and feeling individual, is replaced by the impersonal activity of \"reading,\" and what is read is not a work imbued with meanings, but \u00e9cr\u00ecture, writing. The focus of structuralist criticism, accordingly, is on the im\u00ad personal process of reading which, by bringing into play the requisite conventions, codes, and expectations, makes literary sense of the se\u00ad quence of words, phrases, and sentences that constitute a text. See text and writing (\u00e9criture). In the late 1960s, the general structuralist enterprise, in its rigorous form and inclusive pretensions, ceded its central position to deconstruction and other modes of poststructural theories, which subverted the scientific claims of structuralism and its view that literary meanings are made determinate by a system of invariant conventions and codes. (See poststructuralism.) This shift in the prevailing point of view is exemplified by the changing emphases in the lively and influential writings of the French critic and man of letters, Roland Barthes (1915-80). His early work developed and helped disseminate the structuralist theory that was based on the linguistics of Saussure\u2014a theory that Barthes applied not only to literature but (in Mythologies, 1957) to decod\u00ad ing, by reference to its underlying signifying system, many aspects of popular culture. In his later writings, Barthes abandoned the scientific aspiration of structuralism, and distinguished between the \"readerly\" text such as the real\u00ad istic novel that tries to \"close\" interpretation by insisting on specific mean\u00ad ings, and the \"writerly\" text that aims at the ideal of \"a galaxy of signifiers,\" and so encourages the reader to be a producer of his or her own meanings ac\u00ad cording not to one code but to a multiplicity of codes. And in The Pleasure of the Text (1973) Barthes lauds, in contrast to the comfortable pleasure offered by a traditional text that accords with cultural conventions, the jouissance (or orgasmic bliss) evoked by a text that incites a hedonistic abandon to the un\u00ad controlled play of its signifiers. Structuralist premises and procedures, however, continue to manifest themselves in a number of current enterprises, and especially in the semiotic analysis of cultural phenomena, in stylistics, and in the investigation of the for\u00ad mal structures that, in their combinations and variations, constitute the plots in novels. See semiotics, cultural studies, stylistics, and nanative and nanatology. A clear and comprehensive survey of the program and accomplishments of structuralist literary criticism, in poetry as well as narrative prose, is Jonathan Culler, Structuralist Poetics (1975); also Robert Scholes, Structuralism in Literature: An Introduction (1974). For an introduction to the general move\u00ad ment of structuralism see Philip Pettit, The Concept of Structuralism: A Critical Analysis (1975); The Art of the Intelligible (1960).

Merquior, From Prague to Paris: A Critique of Structuralist and Post-Structuralist Thought (1986); Leonard STYLE 303 Jackson, The Poverty of Structuralism: Literature and Structuralist Theory (1991).

Fer\u00ad nande, eds., The Structuralists: From Marx to L\u00e9vi-Strauss (1972); Robey, ed., Introduction and Eugenio Donato, eds., The Structuralist Controversy: The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man (1970). Among the books of structuralist literary criticism available in English translations are Roland Barthes, Critical Essays (1964); Stephen Heath, The Nouveau Roman: A Study in the Practice of Writing (1972); Tzvetan Todorov, The Poetics of Prose (trans., 1977) and Introduction to Poetics (trans., 1981); G\u00e9rard Genette, Figures of Literary Discourse (trans., 1984). Struc\u00ad turalist treatments of cinema are Christian Metz, Language of Film (1973) and Peter Wollen, Signs and Meaning in the Cinema (1969). Style has traditionally been defined as the manner of linguistic expression in prose or verse\u2014as how speakers or writers say whatever it is that they say. The style specific to a particular work or writer, or else distinctive of a type of writ\u00ad ings, has been analyzed in such terms as the rhetorical situation and aim (see rhetoric); characteristic diction, or choice of words; type of sentence structure and syntax; and the density and kinds of figurative language. In standard theories based on Cicero and other classical rhetoricians, styles were usually classified into three main levels: the high (or \"grand\"), the middle (or \"mean\"), and the low (or \"plain\") style. The doctrine of decorum, which was influential through the eighteenth century, required that the level of style in a work be appropriate to the social class of the speaker, to the occa\u00ad sion on which it is spoken, and to the dignity of its literary genre (see poetic dic\u00ad tion). The modern critic Northrop Frye has introduced a variant of this long-persisting analysis of stylistic levels in literature. He makes a primary dif\u00ad ferentiation between the demotic style (which is modeled on the language, rhythms, and associations of ordinary speech) and the hieratic style (which employs a variety of formal elaborations that separate the literary language from ordinary speech). Frye then proceeds to distinguish a high, middle, and low level in each of these classes. See The Well-Tempered Critic (1963), chapter 2. In analyzing style, two types of sentence structure are often distinguished: The periodic sentence is one in which the component parts, or \"mem\u00ad bers,\" are so composed that the close of its syntactic structure remains sus\u00ad pended until the end of the sentence; the effect tends to be formal or oratorical. An example is the eloquent opening sentence of James Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson (1791), in which the structure of the syntax is not con\u00ad cluded until we reach the final noun, \"task\": To write the life of him who excelled all mankind in writing the lives of others, and who, whether we consider his extraordinary endowments, or his various works, has been equaled by few in any age, is an arduous, and may be reckoned in me a presumptuous task. In the nonperiodic (or loose) sentence\u2014which is more relaxed and conver\u00ad sational in effect\u2014the component members are continuous, but so loosely 304 STYLE joined that the sentence would have been syntactically complete if a period had been inserted at one or more places before the actual close. So Joseph Ad\u00ad dison's two sentences in Spectator 105, describing the limited topics in the conversation of a \"man-about-town,\" or dilettante, could each have closed at several points in the sequence of their component clauses: He will tell you the names of the principal favourites, repeat the shrewd sayings of a man of quality, whisper an intrigue that is not yet blown upon by common fame; or, if the sphere of his observations is a little larger than ordinary, will perhaps enter into all the incidents, turns, and revolutions in a game of ombre. When he has gone thus far he has shown you the whole circle of his accomplishments, his parts are drained, and he is disabled from any farther conversation. Another distinction often made in discussing prose style is that between parataxis and hypotaxis: A paratactic style is one in which the members within a sentence, or else a sequence of complete sentences, are put one after the other without any ex\u00ad pression of their connection or relations except (at most) the noncommittal connective \"and.\" Ernest Hemingway's style is characteristically paratactic. The members in this sentence from his novel The Sun Also Rises (1926) are joined merely by \"ands\": \"It was dim and dark and the pillars went high up, and there were people praying, and it smelt of incense, and there were some wonderful big buildings.\" The curt paratactic sentences in his short story \"In\u00ad dian Camp\" omit all connectives: \"The sun was coming over the hills. A bass jumped, making a circle in the water. Nick trailed his hand in the water. It felt warm in the sharp chill of the morning.\" A hypotactic style is one in which the temporal, causal, logical, and syn\u00ad tactic relations between members and sentences are specified by words (such as \"when,\" \"then,\" \"because,\" \"therefore\") or by phrases (such as \"in order to,\" \"as a result\") or by the use of subordinate phrases and clauses. The style in this Glossary is mainly hypotactic. A very large number of loosely descriptive terms are used to characterize kinds of style, such as \"pure,\" \"ornate,\" \"florid,\" \"gay,\" \"sober,\" \"simple,\" \"elaborate,\" and so on. Styles are also classified according to a literary period or tradition (\"the metaphysical style,\" \"Restoration prose style\"); according to an influential text (\"biblical style,\" euphuism); according to an institutional use (\"a scientific style,\" \"journalese\"); or according to the distinctive practice of an individual author (the \"Shakespearean\" or \"Miltonic style\"; \"John\u00ad sonese\"). Historians of English prose style, especially in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, have distinguished between the vogue of the \"Ciceron\u00ad ian style\" (named after the characteristic practice of the Roman writer Cicero), which is elaborately constructed, highly periodic, and typically builds to a cli\u00ad max, and the opposing vogue of the clipped, concise, pointed, and uniformly stressed sentences in the \"Attic\" or \"Senecan\" styles (named after the practice of the Roman Seneca). See J. M. Patrick and others, eds., Style, Rhetoric, and Rhythm: Essays by Morris W. Croll (1966), and George Williamson, The Senecan Amble: A Study in Prose Form from Bacon to Collier (1951). STYLISTICS 305 Francis-No\u00ebl Thomas and Mark Turner, in Clear and Simple as the Truth (1994), claim that standard treatments of style such as those described above deal only with the surface features of writing. They propose instead a basic analysis of style in terms of a set of fundamental decisions or assumptions by an author concerning \"a series of relationships: What can be known? What can be put into words? What is the relationship between thought and lan\u00ad guage? Who is the writer addressing and why? What is the implied relation\u00ad ship between writer and reader? What are the implied conditions of discourse?\" An analysis based on all these elements yields an indefinite num\u00ad ber of types, or \"families,\" of styles, each with its own criteria of excellence. The authors focus on \"the classic style\" exemplified in writings like Ren\u00e9 Descartes' Discourse on Method (1637) or Thomas Jefferson's \"Declaration of Independence\" (1776), but identify and discuss briefly a number of styles such style,\" and \"prophetic style.\" For some recent developments in the treatment of style based on modern linguistic theory and philosophy of language, see stylistics and discourse analy\u00ad sis. Among the more traditional theorists and analysts of style are Herbert Read, English Prose Style (1928); Bonamy Dobree, Modem Prose Style (1934); W. K. Wimsatt, The Prose Style of Samuel Johnson (1941); P. F. Baum, The Other Harmony of Prose (1952); Erich Auerbach, Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature (1953); Josephine Miles, Eras and Modes in English Poetry (1957); Louis T. Milic, ed., Stylists on Style: A Handbook with Selections for Analy\u00ad sis (1969). Stylistics. Since the 1950s the term stylistics has been applied to critical procedures which undertake to replace what is said to be the subjectivity and impressionism of standard analyses with an \"objective\" or \"scientific\" analy\u00ad sis of the style of literary texts. Much of the impetus toward these analytic methods, as well as models for their practical application, were provided by the writings of Roman Jakobson and other Russian formalists, as well as by Eu\u00ad ropean structuralists. We can distinguish two main modes of stylistics, which differ both in conception and in the scope of their application: (1) In the narrower mode of formal stylistics, style is identified, in the traditional way, by the distinction between what is said and how it is said, or between the content and the form of a text. (See style.) The content is now often denoted, however, by terms such as \"informa\u00ad tion,\" \"message,\" or \"propositional meaning,\" while the style is de\u00ad fined as variations in the presentation of this information that serve to alter its \"aesthetic quality\" or the reader's emotional response. The concepts of modern linguistics are used to identify the stylistic fea\u00ad tures, or \"formal properties,\" which are held to be distinctive of a par\u00ad ticular work, or else of an author, or a literary tradition, or an era. These stylistic features may be phonological (patterns of speech sounds, meter, or rhyme), or syntactic (types of sentence structure), or lexical (abstract vs. concrete words, the relative frequency of nouns, verbs, adjectives), or rhetorical (the characteristic use of figurative lan\u00ad guage, imagery, and so on). A basic problem, acknowledged by a num\u00ad ber of stylisticians, is to distinguish between the innumerable features and patterns of a text which can be isolated by linguistic analysis, and those features which are functionally stylistic\u2014that is, features which make an actual difference in the aesthetic and other effects on a com\u00ad petent reader. See, for example, Michael Riffaterre's objection to the elaborate stylistic analysis of Charles Baudelaire's sonnet \"Les Chats\" (The Cats) by Roman Jakobson and Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, in Structural\u00ad ism, ed. Jacques Ehrmann (1966). Stylisticians who aim either to replace or supplement the qualita\u00ad tive judgments of literary scholars by objectively determinable meth\u00ad ods of research exploit the ever-increasing technological resources of computers in the service of what has come to be called stylometry: the quantitative measurement of the features of an individual writer's style. Literary and Linguistic Computing is a journal devoted to the use of computers in literary studies, and the \"Voice of the Shuttle\" web site at http://humanitas.ucsb.edu provides up-to-date information on the general use of computers and other electronic media in literary studies. See also B. H. Rudall and T. N. Corns, Computers and Literature: A Practical Guide (1987). Other analysts of style who use nonquantita\u00ad tive methods make use of concepts derived from language theory, such as the distinction between paradigmatic and syntagmatic rela\u00ad tions, or the distinction between surface structure and deep structure in transformational linguistics, or the distinction between the proposi- tional content and the illocutionary force of an utterance in speech-act theory. For a stylistic analysis of the ways a character's speech and thought are represented in narratives, refer to free indirect discourse, under point of view. Sometimes the stylistic enterprise stops with the qualitative or quantitative determination, or \"fingerprinting,\" of the style of a sin\u00ad gle text or class of texts. Often, however, the analyst tries also to relate distinctive stylistic features to traits in an author's psyche; or to an au\u00ad thor's characteristic ways of perceiving the world and organizing ex\u00ad perience (see Leo Spitzer, Linguistics and Literary History, 1948); or to the typical conceptual frame and the attitude to reality in an histori\u00ad cal era (Erich Auerbach, Mimesis, 1953); or else to semantic, aesthetic, and emotional functions and effects in a particular literary text (Michael Riff aterre and others). Stanley Fish wrote a sharp critique of the scientific pretensions of formal stylistics; he proposed that since, in his view, the meaning of a text consists of a reader's total response to it, there is no valid way to make a distinction in this spectrum of response between style and content (\"What Is Stylistics and Why Are They Saying Such Terrible STYLisTics 307 Things About It?\" in Is There a Text in This Class? 1980; see also reader-response criticism). For extended critiques of traditional analy\u00ad ses of style, as well as of modern stylistics, based on the thesis that style is not a separable feature of language, see Bennison Gray, Style: The Problem and Its Solution (1969), and \"Stylistics: The End of a Tra\u00ad dition,\" Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 31 (1973). In Clear and Simple as the Truth (1994), Francis-N\u00f6el Thomas and Mark Turner claim that standard stylistic analyses concern merely the surface fea\u00ad tures of writing, and propose a set of more basic features by which to define styles of writing; see under style. On the other side, the valid\u00ad ity of distinguishing between style and propositional meaning\u2014not absolutely, but on an appropriate level of analysis\u2014is defended by E. D. Hirsch, \"Stylistics and Synonymity,\" in The Aims of Interpretation (1976). (2) In the second mode of stylistics, which has been prominent since the mid-1960s, proponents greatly expand the conception and scope of their inquiry by defining stylistics as, in the words of one theorist, \"the study of the use of language in literature,\" involving the entire range of the \"general characteristics of language ... as a medium of literary expression.\" (Geoffrey N. Leech, A Linguistic Guide to English Poetry, 1969; see also Mick Short, \"Literature and Language,\" in Ency\u00ad clopedia of Literature and Criticism, ed. Martin Coyle and others, 1990.) By this definition, stylistics is expanded so as to incorporate most of the concerns of both traditional literary criticism and traditional rhet\u00ad oric; its distinction from these earlier pursuits is that it insists on the need to be objective by focusing sharply on the text itself and by set\u00ad ting out to discover the \"rules\" governing the process by which lin\u00ad guistic elements and patterns in a text accomplish their meanings and literary effects. The historian of criticism Ren\u00e9 Wellek has de\u00ad scribed this tendency of stylistic analysis to enlarge its territorial do\u00ad main as \"the imperialism of modern stylistics.\" A comprehensive anthology is The Stylistics Reader from Roman Jakobson to the Present, ed. Jean Jacques Weber (1996). On formal styl\u00ad istics see Thomas A. Sebeok, ed., Style in Language (1960); Seymour Chatman, ed., Literary Style: A Symposium (1971); Howard S. Babb, ed., Essays in Stylistic Analysis (1972); Richard Bradford, Stylistics (1997). For an exhaustive stylistic analysis of a twelve-line poem, see Roman Jakobson and Stephen Rudy, Yeats's \"Sonow of Love\" Through the Years (1977). In the practice of some critics, stylistics includes the area of study known as discourse analysis, which is treated in a separate entry in this Glossary. For inclusive views of the realm of stylistics, see M. A. K. Hal- liday, Explorations in the Functions of Language (1973); G. N. Leech and M. H. Short, Style in Fiction (1981); Roger Fowler, Linguistic Criticism (1986); Ronald Carter and Paul Simpson, eds., Language, Discourse and Literature: An Introductory Reader in Discourse Stylistics (1989). 308 SUBLIME Sublime. The concept was introduced into the criticism of literature and art by a Greek treatise Peri hupsous (\"On the sublime\"), attributed in the manu\u00ad script to Longinus and probably written in the first century A.D. AS defined by Longinus, the sublime is a quality that can occur in any type of discourse, whether poetry or prose. Whereas the effect of rhetoric on the hearer or reader of a discourse is persuasion, the effect of the sublime is \"transport\" (ekstasis)\u2014 it is that quality of a passage which \"shatters the hearer's composure,\" exer\u00ad cises irresistible \"domination\" over him, and \"scatters the subjects like a bolt of lightning.\" The source of the sublime lies in the capacities of the speaker or writer. Three of these capacities\u2014the use of figurative language, nobility of expression, and elevated composition\u2014are matters of art that can be acquired by practice; but two other, and more important, capacities, are largely innate: \"loftiness of thought\" and \"strong and inspired passion.\" The ability to achieve sublimity is in itself enough to establish the transcendent genius of a writer, and expresses the nobility of the writer's character: \"sublimity is the ring of greatness in the soul.\" Longinus' examples of sublime passages in poems range from the epics of Homer through the tragedies of Aeschylus to a love-lyric by Sappho; his examples in prose are taken from the writings of the philosopher Plato, the orator Demosthenes, and the historian Herodotus. Es\u00ad pecially notable is his quotation, as a prime instance of sublimity, of the pas\u00ad sage in the Book of Genesis written by \"the lawgiver of the Jews\": \"And God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light, 'Let there be land,' and there was land.\" Longinus' treatise exerted a persistent effect on literary criticism after it became widely known by way of a French translation by Boileau in 1674; even\u00ad tually, it helped establish both the expressive theory of poetry and the critical method of impressionism (see under criticism). In the eighteenth century an im\u00ad portant phenomenon was the shift in the location of the sublime from a qual\u00ad ity of linguistic discourse that originates in the powers of a writer's mind, to a quality inherent in external objects, and above all in the scenes and occur\u00ad rences of the natural world. Thus Edmund Burke's highly influential Philosoph\u00ad ical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful, published in 1757, attributes the source of the sublime to whatever things are \"in any sort terrible\"\u2014that is, to whatever is \"fitted in any sort to excite the ideas of pain, and danger\"\u2014provided that the observer is in a situation of safety from dan\u00ad ger, and so is able to experience what would otherwise be a painful terror as a \"delightful horror.\" The qualities of objects conducive to sublime horror that Burke stresses are obscurity, immense power, and vastness in dimension or quantity. Burke's examples of the sublime include vast architectural structures, Milton's description of Satan in Paradise Lost, the description of the king's army in Shakespeare's 1 Henry IV, and natural phenomena; a sublime passion may be produced by \"the noise of vast cataracts, raging storms, thunder or ar\u00ad tillery,\" all of which evoke \"a great and awful sensation in the mind.\" During the eighteenth century, tourists and landscape painters traveled to the English Lake Country and to the Alps in search of sublime scenery that SUBLIME 309 was thrillingly vast, dark, wild, stormy, and ominous. Writers of what was called \"the sublime ode,\" such as Thomas Gray and William Collins, sought to achieve effects of wildness and obscurity in their descriptive style and abrupt transitions, as well as to render the wildness, vastness, and obscurity of the sublime objects they described. (See ode.) Authors of Gothic novels ex\u00ad ploited the sublimity of delightful horror both in the natural and architec\u00ad tural settings of their narratives and in the actions and events that they narrated. Samuel H. Monk, a pioneer historian of the sublime in the eigh\u00ad teenth century, cites as the \"apotheosis\" of the natural sublime the descrip\u00ad tion of Simpl\u00f3n Pass in Wordsworth's The Prelude (1805), 4.554 ff.: The immeasurable height Of woods decaying, never to be decayed, The stationary blasts of waterfalls, And everywhere along the hollow rent Winds thwarting winds, bewildered and forlorn, The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky, The rocks that muttered close upon our ears\u2014 Black drizzling crags that spake by the wayside As if a voice were in them\u2014the sick sight And giddy prospect of the raving stream, Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light. ... (See Samuel H. Monk, The Sublime: A Study of Crit\u00ad ical Theories in Eighteenth-Century England, 1935.) In an extended analysis of the sublime in his Critique of Judgment (1790), the philosopher Immanuel Kant divided the sublime objects specified by Burke and other earlier theorists into two kinds: (1) the \"mathematical sublime\" en\u00ad compasses the sublime of vastness or seeming limitless- ness or infinitude in number. (2) The \"dynamic sublime\" encompasses the objects conducive to terror at our seeming helplessness before the over\u00ad whelming power of nature, provided that the terror is rendered pleasurable by the safe situation of the observer. All of Kant's examples of sublimity are scenes and events in the natural world: \"the immeasurable host\" of starry sys\u00ad tems such as the Milky Way, \"shapeless mountain masses towering one above the other in wild disorder,\" \"volcanoes in all their violence of destruction, hurricanes leaving desolation in their track, the boundless ocean rising with rebellious force, the high waterfall of some mighty river.\" Kant maintains, however, that the sublimity resides \"not in the Object of nature\" itself, but \"only in the mind of the judging Subject\" who contemplates the object. In a noted passage he describes the experience of sublimity as a rapid sequence of painful blockage and pleasurable release\u2014\"the feeling of a momentary check to the vital forces followed at once by a discharge all the more powerful.\" In the mathematical sublime, the mind is checked by its inadequacy to compre\u00ad hend as a totality the boundlessness or seeming infinity of natural magni\u00ad tudes, and in the dynamic sublime, it is checked by its helplessness before the seeming irresistibility of natural powers. But the mind then goes on to feel 310 SURREALISM exultation at the recognition of its inherent capacity to think a totality in a way that transcends \"every standard of sense/' or else at its discovery within ourselves of a capacity for resistance which \"gives us courage to be able to measure ourselves against the seeming omnipotence of nature.\" In Kant's view, the ability to experience the sublime exemplifies on the one hand the limitations and weakness of finite humanity, but on the other hand its \"pre\u00ad eminence over nature,\" even when confronted by the \"immeasurability\" of nature's magnitude and the \"irresistibility\" of its might. In The Romantic Sublime: Studies in the Structure and Psychology of Transcen\u00ad dence (1976), Thomas Weiskel undertook to translate Kant's theory of the sub\u00ad lime, and especially his analysis of blockage and release, into terms both of recent semiotic theory and of the psychoanalytic theory of the Oedipus com\u00ad plex. See also Neil Hertz, The End of the Line: Essays on Psychoanalysis and the Sublime (1985). Refer to Elder Olson, \"The Argument of Longinus' On the Sublime,\" in Crit\u00ad ics and Criticism, Ancient and Modern, ed. R. S. Crane (1952); W. J. Hippie, The Beautiful, the Sublime, and the Picturesque in Eighteenth-Century British Aesthetic Theory (1957); Marjorie Nicholson, Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory (1959); Steven Knapp, Personification and the Sublime: Milton to Coleridge (1985). Surrealism (\"superrealism\") was launched as a concerted artistic movement in France by Andr\u00e9 Breton's Manifesto on Sunealism (1924). It was a successor to the brief movement known as Dadaism, which emerged in 1916 out of dis\u00ad gust with the brutality and destructiveness of the First World War, and set out, according to its manifestos, to engender a negative art and literature that would destroy the false values of modern bourgeois society, including its ra\u00ad tionality and the art and literature it had fostered. Among the exponents of Dadaism were, for a time, artists and poets such as Tristan Tzara, Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, and Max Ernst. The expressed aim of surrealism was a revolt against all restraints on free creativity, including logical reason, standard morality, social and artistic con\u00ad ventions and norms, and all control over the artistic process by forethought and intention. To ensure the unhampered operation of the \"deep mind,\" which they regarded as the only source of valid knowledge as well as art, sur\u00ad realists turned to automatic writing (writing delivered over to the promptings of the unconscious mind), and to exploiting the material of dreams, of states of mind between sleep and waking, and of natural or artificially induced hal\u00ad lucinations. Surrealism was a revolutionary movement in painting, sculpture, and the other arts, as well as literature; and it often joined forces, although briefly, with one or another revolutionary movement in the political and social realm. The effects of surrealism extended far beyond the small group of its professed adherents such as Andr\u00e9 Breton, Louis Aragon, and the painter Sal\u00ad vador Dali. The influence, direct or indirect, of surrealist innovations can be found in many modern writers of prose and verse who have broken with con\u00ad ventional modes of artistic organization to experiment with free association, SYMBOL 311 a broken syntax, nonlogical and nonchronological order, dreamlike and nightmarish sequences, and the juxtaposition of bizarre, shocking, or seem\u00ad ingly unrelated images. In England and America such effects can be found in a wide range of writings, from the poetry of Dylan Thomas to the flights of fantasy, hallucinative writing, startling inconsequences, and black humor in the novels of Henry Miller, William Burroughs, and Thomas Pynchon. For a precursor of some aspects of surrealism, see decadence; for later de\u00ad velopments that continued some of the surrealist innovations, see literature of the absurd, antinovel, magic realism, and postmodernism. Refer to David Gas- coyne, A Short Survey ofSunealism (1935); A. E. Balakian, Origins of Sur\u00ad realism Maurice Nadeau, History ofSunealism (trans., 1967); Mary Ann Caws, The Poetry of Dada and Sunealism (1970); Paul C. Ray, The Surrealist Movement in England (1971). In Automatic Woman: The Representation of Women in Surrealism (1996), Katharine Conley analyzes the obsessive and complex concern of male surrealists with the female body, which was often repre\u00ad sented in a distorted or dissected form; she also discusses the work of two fe\u00ad male surrealists, Unica Z\u00fcrn and Leonora Carrington. Symbol. In the broadest sense a symbol is anything which signifies some\u00ad thing; in this sense all words are symbols. In discussing literature, however, the term \"symbol\" is applied only to a word or phrase that signifies an object or event which in its turn signifies something, or has a range of reference, be\u00ad yond itself. Some symbols are \"conventional\" or \"public\": \"the Red, White, and Blue,\" and \"the Good Shepherd\" are terms that refer to symbolic objects of which the further significance is determinate within a particular culture. Poets, like all of us, use such conventional symbols; many poets, however, also use \"private\" or \"personal symbols.\" Often they do so by exploiting widely shared associations between an object or event or action and a particular concept; for example, the general association of a peacock with pride and of an eagle with heroic endeavor, or the rising sun with birth and the setting sun with death, or climbing with effort or progress and de\u00ad scent with surrender or failure. Some poets, however, repeatedly use symbols whose significance they largely generate themselves, and these pose a more difficult problem in interpretation. Take as an example the word \"rose,\" which in its literal use signifies a kind of flower. In Robert Burns' line \"O my love's like a red, red rose,\" the word \"rose\" is used as a simile; and in the lines by Winthrop Mackworth Praed, She was our queen, our rose, our star; And then she danced\u2014O Heaven, her dancing! the word \"rose\" is used as a metaphor. In The Romance of the Rose, a long me\u00ad dieval dream vision, we read about a half-opened rose to which the dreamer's access is aided by a character called \"Fair Welcome,\" but impeded or forbid\u00ad den by other characters called \"Reason,\" \"Shame,\" and \"Jealousy.\" We readily recognize that the whole narrative is a sustained allegory about an elaborate 312 SYMBOL courtship, in which most of the agents are personified abstractions and the rose itself functions as an allegorical emblem (that is, an object whose signif\u00ad icance is made determinate by its qualities and by the role it plays in the nar\u00ad rative) which represents both the lady's love and her lovely body. Then we read William Blake's poem \"The Sick Rose.\" O Rose, thou art sick. The invisible worm That flies in the night In the howling storm Has found out thy bed Of crimson joy, And his dark secret love Does thy life destroy. This rose is not the vehicle for a simile or metaphor, because it lacks the paired subject\u2014\"my love,\" or the girl referred to as \"she,\" in the examples just cited\u2014which is an identifying feature of these figures. And it is not an alle\u00ad gorical rose, since, unlike the flower in The Romance of the Rose, it is not part of an obvious double order of correlated references, one literal and the second allegorical, in which the allegorical or emblematic reference of the rose is made determinate by its role within the literal narrative. Blake's rose is a rose\u2014yet it is patently also something more than a rose: words such as \"bed,\" \"joy,\" \"love,\" which do not comport literally with an actual flower, together with the sinister tone, and the intensity of the lyric speaker's feeling, press the reader to infer that the described object has a further range of suggested but unspecified reference which makes it a symbol. But Blake's rose is a personal symbol and not\u2014like the symbolic rose in the closing cantos of Dante's fourteenth-century Paradiso and other Christian poems\u2014an element in a set of conventional and widely known (hence \"public\") religious symbols, in which concrete objects of this passing world are used to signify, in a relatively determinate way, the objects and truths of a higher eternal realm. (See Barbara Seward, The Symbolic Rose, 1960.) Only from the implicit suggestions in Blake's poem itself\u2014the sexual connotations, in the realm of human ex\u00ad perience, of \"bed\" and \"love,\" especially in conjunction with \"joy\" and \"worm\"\u2014supplemented by our knowledge of similar elements and topics in his other poems, are we led to infer that Blake's lament for a crimson rose which has been entered and sickened unto death by a dark and secret worm symbolizes, in the human realm, the destruction wrought by furtiveness, de\u00ad ceit, and hypocrisy in what should be a frank and joyous relationship of phys\u00ad ical love. Various critics of the poem, however, have proposed alternative interpretations of its symbolic significance. It is an attribute of many private symbols\u2014the White Whale in Melville's Moby-Dick (1851) is another famed example\u2014as well as a reason why they are an irreplaceable literary device, that they suggest a direction or a broad area of significance rather than, like an emblem in an allegorical narrative, a relatively determinate reference. In the copious modern literature on the nature of the literary symbol, ref\u00ad erence is often made to two seminal passages, written early in the nineteenth SYMBOL 313 century by Coleridge in England and Goethe in Germany, concerning the dif\u00ad ference between an allegory and a symbol. Coleridge is in fact describing what he believes to be the uniquely symbolic nature of the Bible as a sacred text, but later commentators have assumed (probably mistakenly) that he intended his comment to apply also to the symbol in secular literature: Now an allegory is but a translation of abstract notions into a picture- language, which is itself nothing but an abstraction from objects of the senses.... On the other hand a symbol... is characterized by a translu- cence of the special [i.e., of the species] in the individual, or of the gen\u00ad eral [i.e., of the genus] in the special, or of the universal in the general; above all by the translucence of the eternal through and in the temporal. It always partakes of the reality which it renders intelligible; and while it enunciates the whole, abides itself as a living part in that unity of which it is the representative. [Allegories] are but empty echoes which the fancy arbitrarily associates with apparitions of matter.... (Coleridge, The Statesman's Manual, 1816) Goethe had been meditating about the nature of the literary symbol in secu\u00ad lar writings since the 1790s, but gave his concept its clearest formulations in 1824: There is a great difference, whether the poet seeks the particular for the sake of the general or sees the general in the particular. From the former procedure there ensues allegory, in which the particular serves only as il\u00ad lustration, as example of the general. The latter procedure, however, is genuinely the nature of poetry; it expresses something particular, with\u00ad out thinking of the general or pointing to it. Allegory transforms the phenomenon into a concept, the concept into an image, but in such a way that the concept always remains bounded in the image, and is entirely to be kept and held in it, and to be expressed by it. Symbolism [however] transforms the phenomenon into idea, the idea into an image, and in such a way that the idea remains always infi\u00ad nitely active and unapproachable in the image, and even if expressed in all languages, still would remain inexpressible. (Goethe, Maxims and Reflections, Nos. 279, 1112, 1113) It will be noted that, whatever the differences between these cryptic passages, both Coleridge and Goethe stress that an allegory presents a pair of subjects (an image and a concept) and a symbol only one (the image alone); that the allegory is relatively specific in its reference, while the symbol remains indefi\u00ad nite, but richly\u2014even infinitely\u2014suggestive in its significance; and also that for this very reason, a symbol is the higher mode of expression. To these claims, characteristic in the Romantic Period, critics until the recent past have for the most part agreed. In express opposition to romantic theory, however, Paul de Man has elevated allegory over symbol because, he claims, it is less \"mystified\" about its status as a purely rhetorical device. See de Man, \"The Rhetoric of Temporality,\" in Interpretation: Theory and Practice, ed. C. S. Single\u00ad ton (1969), and Allegories of Reading (1979). 314 SYMBOLIST MOVEMENT See W. B. Yeats, \"The Symbolism of Poetry\" (1900), in Essays and Introduc\u00ad (1961); H. Flanders Dunbar, Symbolism in Medieval Thought (1929); C. S.

Hungerland, Poetic Discourse (1958), chapter 5; Maurice Beebe, ed., Literary Symbolism (1960). Symbolist Movement. Various poets of the Romantic Period, including No\u00ad valis and H\u00f6lderlin in Germany and Shelley in England, often used private symbols in their poetry (see symbol). Shelley, for example, repeatedly made symbolic use of objects such as the morning and evening star, a boat moving upstream, winding caves, and the conflict between a serpent and an eagle. William Blake, however, exceeded all his romantic contemporaries in his re\u00ad course to a persistent and sustained symbolism\u2014that is, a coherent system composed of a number of symbolic elements\u2014both in his lyric poems and his long prophetic, or epic poems. In nineteenth-century America, a symbolist procedure was prominent in the novels of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville, the prose of Emerson and Thoreau, and the poetic theory and prac\u00ad tice of Poe. (See Charles Feidelson, Jr., Symbolism and American Literature, 1953.) These writers derived the mode in large part from the native Puritan tradition of typology (see interpretation: typological and allegorical), and also from the theory of \"correspondences\" of the Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772). In the usage of literary historians, however, Symbolist Movement desig\u00ad nates specifically a group of French writers beginning with Charles Baudelaire {Fleurs du mal, 1857) and including such later poets as Arthur Rimbaud, Paul Verlaine, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, and Paul Val\u00e9ry. Baudelaire based the symbolic mode of his poems in part on the example of the American Edgar Allan Poe, but especially on the ancient belief in correspondences\u2014the doctrine that there exist inherent and systematic analogies between the human mind and the outer world, and also between the natural and the spiritual worlds. As Baudelaire put this doctrine: \"Everything, form, movement, number, color, perfume, in the spiritual as in the natural world, is significative, reciprocal, converse, conespondent.\" The techniques of the French Symbolists, who ex\u00ad ploited an order of private symbols in a poetry of rich suggestiveness rather than explicit signification, had an immense influence throughout Europe, and (especially in the 1890s and later) in England and America on poets such as Arthur Symons and Ernest Dowson (see Decadence) as well as W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, Dylan Thomas, Hart Crane, e. e. cummings, and Wallace Stevens. Major symbolist poets in Germany are Stefan George and Rainer Maria Rilke. The Modern Period, in the decades after World War I, was a notable era of symbolism in literature. Many of the major writers of the period exploit sym\u00ad bols which are in part drawn from religious and esoteric traditions and in part invented. Some of the works of the age are symbolist in their settings, their agents, and their actions, as well as in the objects they refer to. Instances of a SYNESTHESIA \u00b7 TENSION 315 persistently symbolic procedure occur in lyrics (Yeats' \"Byzantium\" poems, Dylan Thomas' series of sonnets Altarwise by Owl-light), in longer poems (Hart Crane's The Bridge, T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land, Wallace Stevens' \"The Come\u00ad dian as the Letter C\"), and in novels (James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury). See Arthur Symons, The Symbolist Movement in Literature (1899, reprinted 1958); Edmund Wilson, Axel's Castle (1936); C. M. Bowra, The Heritage of Sym\u00ad bolism (1943); Kenneth Cornell, The Symbolist Movement (1951); Edward En\u00ad gelberg, ed., The Symbolist Poem (1967); and Anna Balakian, ed., The Symbolist Movement in the Literature of European Languages (1982). For attempts to de\u00ad code William Blake's complex symbolism, see S. Foster Damon, A Blake Dictio\u00ad nary: The Ideas and Symbols of William Blake (1965), and Northrop Frye, Fearful Symmetry (1947). Synesthesia signifies the experience of two or more kinds of sensation when only one sense is being stimulated. In literature the term is applied to descriptions of one kind of sensation in terms of another; color is attributed to sounds, odor to colors, sound to odors, and so on. We often speak of loud colors, bright sounds, and sweet music. A complex literary example of synes\u00ad thesia (which is sometimes also called \"sense transference\" Sensitive Plant\" (1820): And the hyacinth purple, and white, and blue, Which flung from its bells a sweet peal anew Of music so delicate, soft, and intense, It was felt like an odor within the sense. The varicolored, bell-shaped flowers of the hyacinth send out a peal of music which effects a sensation as though it were (what in fact it is) the scent of the flowers. Keats, in the \"Ode to a Nightingale\" (1819), calls for a draught of wine Tasting of Flora and the country green, Dance, and Proven\u00e7al song, and sunburnt mirth; that is, he calls for a drink tasting of sight, color, motion, sound, and heat. Occasional uses of synesthetic imagery have been made by poets ever since Homer. Such imagery became much more frequent in the Romantic pe\u00ad riod, and was especially exploited by the French Symbolists of the middle and later nineteenth century; see Baudelaire's sonnet \"Correspondences,\" and Rimbaud's sonnet on the color of vowel sounds \"A black, E white, I red, U green, O blue.\" Refer to June Downey, Creative Imagination (1929), and to the general dis\u00ad cussion and detailed analyses of synesthesia in Richard H. Fogel, The Imagery of Keats and Shelley (1949), chapter 3. Tension became a common descriptive and evaluative word in the criticism of the 1930s and later, especially after Allen Tate, one of the New Critics, pro\u00ad posed it as a term to be made by \"lopping the prefixes off the logical terms ex\u00ad tension and \u00bf\u00abtension.\" In technical logic the \"intension\" of a word is the set 31 6 TEXT AND WRITING (\u00c9CRITURE) of abstract attributes which must be possessed by any object to which the word can be literally applied, and the \"extension\" of a word is the class of concrete objects to which the word applies. The meaning of good poetry ac\u00ad cording to Tate, \"is its 'tension/ the full organized body of all the extension and intension that we can find in it.\" (\"Tension in Poetry\" 1938, in On the Limits of Poetry, 1948.) It would seem that by this statement Tate meant that a good poem incorporates both the abstract and the concrete, the general idea and the particular image, in an integral whole. (See concrete and abstract, above.) Other critics use \"tension\" to characterize poetry that manifests an equi\u00ad librium of the serious and the ironic, or \"a pattern of resolved stresses,\" or a harmony of opponent tendencies, or any other mode of that stability-in- opposition which was the favorite way in the New Criticism for conceiving the organization of a good poem. And some critics, dubious perhaps about the va\u00ad lidity of Tate's logical derivation of the term, simply apply \"tension\" to any poem in which the elements seem tightly rather than loosely interrelated. Text and Writing (\u00c9criture). Traditional critics have conceived the object of their critical concern to be a literary \"work,\" whose form is achieved by its author's design and its meanings by the author's intentional uses of the verbal medium. French structuralist critics, on the other hand, depersonalized a liter\u00ad ary product by conceiving it to be not a \"work,\" but an impersonal text, a manifestation of the social institution called \u00e9criture (writing). The author is regarded as an intermediary in whom the action of writing precipitates the el\u00ad ements and codes of the pre-existing linguistic and literary system into a par\u00ad ticular text. The interpretation of this writing is effected by a \"lecture\" (French: process of reading) which, by bringing to bear expectations formed by earlier exposure to the functioning of the linguistic system, invests the marks on the page with what merely seem to be their inherent meanings and references to an outer world. Structuralists differ about the degree to which the activity of reading a text is constrained by the literary conventions and codes that went into the writing; many deconstructive critics, however, propose that all writing, by the internal play of opposing forces, disseminates into a set of diverse and opposed meanings. The system of linguistic and literary conventions that constitute a literary text are said by structuralist and poststructuralist critics to be \"naturalized\" in the activity of reading, in that the artifices of a nonreferential \"textuality\" are made to seem vraisemblable (credible)\u2014that is, made to give the illusion of referring to reality\u2014by being brought into accord with modes of discourse and cultural stereotypes that are so familiar and habitual as to seem natural. Natu\u00ad ralization (an alternative term is recuperation) takes place through such ha\u00ad bitual procedures in reading as assigning the text to a specific genre, or taking a fictional text to be the speech of a credibly human narrator, or interpreting its artifices as representing characters, actions, and values that represent, or ac\u00ad cord with, those in an extra-textual world. To a thoroughgoing structuralist or poststructuralist critic, however, not only is the text's representation of the TEXTUAL CRITICISM 317 world no more than an effect generated by the process of reading, but the world is itself held to be in its turn a text; that is, simply a structure of signs whose significance is constituted by the cultural conventions, codes, and ideol\u00ad ogy that happen to be shared by members of a cultural community. The term intertextuality, popularized especially by Julia Kristeva, is used to signify the multiple ways in which any one literary text is made up of other texts, by means of its open or covert citations and allusions, its repetitions and transfor\u00ad mations of the formal and substantive features of earlier texts, or simply its unavoidable participation in the common stock of linguistic and literary con\u00ad ventions and procedures that are \"always already\" in place and constitute the discourses into which we are born. In Kristeva's formulation, accordingly, any text is in fact an \"intertext\"\u2014the site of an intersection of numberless other texts, and existing only through its relations to other texts. Roland Barthes in S/Z (1970) proposed a distinction between a text which is \"lisible\" (readable) and one which, although \"scriptible\" (writable) is \"illisi\u00ad ble\" (unreadable). Readable texts are traditional or \"classical\" ones\u2014such as the realistic novels by Honor\u00e9 Balzac and other nineteenth-century authors\u2014 which for the most part conform to the prevailing codes and conventions, lit\u00ad erary and social, and so are readily and comfortably interpretable and naturalizable in the process of reading. An \"unreadable\" text (such as James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, or the French new novel, or a poem by a highly exper\u00ad imental poet) is one which largely violates, parodies, or innovates upon pre\u00ad vailing conventions, and thus persistently shocks, baffles, and frustrates standard expectations. In Barthes' view an unreadable text, by drawing atten\u00ad tion in this way to the pure conventionality and artifice of literature, laudably destroys any illusion that it represents social reality. In The Pleasure of the Text (published 1973), Barthes assigns to the readable text the response of mere \"plaisir\" (quasi-erotic pleasure), but to the unreadable text the response of \"jouissance\" (orgasmic ecstasy); as Jonathan Culler has put Barthes' view, jouissance is \"a rapture of dislocation produced by ruptures or violations of intelligibility\" (Structuralist Poetics, p. 192). For related matters and relevant bibliographic references, see structuralist criticism, poststructuralism, and semiotics. Textual criticism undertakes to establish the principles and procedures that will justify the text of a literary or other work that a scholarly editor pre\u00ad pares and makes available to the public. The theory and practice of textual criticism goes back many centuries. It was applied at first to biblical and clas\u00ad sical texts, of which all the surviving manuscripts had been written (and often altered) by scribes long after the death of the original writers. Later, textual criticism was adapted to apply to the early era of the printed book, then to later times when editors had access to differing editions of a printed text and sometimes to differing manuscripts written by the authors themselves, as well as differing transcripts of such manuscripts by various people. (See format of a book.) Until recently the ruling principle, whether explicit or tacit, was that the task of a scholarly editor is to establish, from all the available evidence in TEXTUAL CRITICISM manuscript and print, the text that as nearly as possible conforms to the text originally composed by its author. In the mid-twentieth century, most scholarly editors subscribed to the principles of the copy-text, as propounded in a highly influential paper by the English bibliographer W. W. Greg. Greg formulated his views mainly with ref\u00ad erence to editing Shakespeare and other Renaissance authors, but the princi\u00ad ples he proposed were soon expanded and modified by Fredson Bowers and others to apply also to later authors and modes of publication and transmis\u00ad sion. The Greg-Bowers theory (as it is often called) proposed, as the goal of a scholarly edition, to establish a single \"authoritative\" or \"definitive\" text that represented the \"final intentions\" of the author at the conclusion of his or her process of composing and revising a work. Editors choose, as the \"copy-text,\" that one of the existing texts judged to be closest to what the author wrote or intended to write; usually the copy-text is the earliest printed edition of a work (or in some cases, the author's written manuscript of a work), since this is judged to be closest to the author's own intentions. This base-text is emended by the editor to eliminate what are judged to be inadvertent errors made by the author in writing out the text, and also to delete intrusive \"substantive\" changes (changes in wording) that are judged to have been introduced by other people without the author's \"authorization.\" (Such non-authorial intru\u00ad sions and changes in the words of a text, by copy editors, printers, and others, are often labeled \"corruptions\" or \"contaminations\" of the original text.) The copy-text is further emended to include any later deletions or additions that the editor judges, from the available evidence, to have been introduced or au\u00ad thorized by the author himself or herself, and that therefore may be assumed to embody the author's \"final intentions.\" The resulting published document (often with copious editorial footnotes and other materials to identify the emendations and record the rejected textual variants) is known as an eclectic text, in that it accords with no existing model, but is constructed by fitting to\u00ad gether materials from a variety of existing texts\u2014materials that are sometimes supplemented by the editor's own conjectures. Beginning in the late 1920s, two developments helped to bring the copy- text theory under increasing scrutiny and objection. One was the appearance of scholarly publications that made available a multitude of diverse forms of a single poem, in drafts, manuscripts, transcriptions (sometimes with changes and insertions) by family and friends, and corrected proof-sheets, even before the poem was originally published. The many volumes of the Cor\u00ad nell Wordsworth, for example, begun in 1975 under the editorship of Stephen Parrish, record all such variants; for a number of Wordsworth's writings, they also print a \"reading copy\" of the full text at sequential stages in the compo\u00ad sition and revision of a single work. Another development was the poststruc\u00ad tural climate of critical opinion, which brought into radical question the centrality of the \"subject,\" or author, and denied the validity of appealing to the intention of a writer as determinative of meaning. A number of poststruc\u00ad tural theorists also shifted attention to the role of social factors in construct\u00ad ing the meanings of a text, or emphasized the variability in the reception and TEXTUAL CRITICISM 319 interpretation of a text over time. (See author and authorship, poststructuralism, and reception theory.) Scholarly endeavors at a single, eclectic, and definitive text of a literary work are now often derogated as resulting in an ideal text that never in fact existed, and is apt to incorporate the inclinations of the editor rather than the intentions of the author. In an influential Critique of Modern Textual Criticism (1983, reissued 1992), Jerome McGann introduced his social theory of tex\u00ad tual criticism, in which he attributes \"textual authority\" to the cumulative social history of the work, including the contributions not only of the author, but also of the editor, publisher, printer, and all others who have cooperated in creating and producing a book that is made available to the public; all these components, in McGann's view, are valid determinants of a text and its meanings, considered as social constructions. In later writings, McGann has stressed the material features of a book\u2014including its typography, paper, for\u00ad mat, and even pricing and advertising\u2014as cooperative with its verbal element in generating its total cultural significance. (See McGann, The Textual Condi\u00ad tion, 1991; refer also to D. F. McKenzie, Bibliography and Sociology of Texts, 1986.) Attempts to edit by reference to an author's final intentions have been brought into further question by Jack Stillinger's Multiple Authorship and the Myth of Solitary Genius (1991), which demonstrates by many examples that the printed text of a work is typically the joint product of a number of partic\u00ad ipants, including friends, family members, transcribers, literary agents, edi\u00ad tors, and printers, in addition to the person who is ordinarily considered to be its sole author. Despite such critiques, the Greg-Bowers copy-text theory has continued to be defended and applied, although with various modifications, by a num\u00ad ber of scholars, most prominently by G. Thomas Tanselle (see his A Rationale of Textual Criticism, 1989). Many editors now subscribe to some form of a theory of textual versions, of which an early exponent was James Thorpe in Principles of Textual Criticism (1972). The growing consensus is that the com\u00ad position of a literary work is a continuous process without a fixed terminus or perfected state, and that each existing stage, or \"version,\" of the process, whether in manuscript or print, has an equal right to be regarded as a product intended by the author at its particular time. A scholarly editor ought, there\u00ad fore, to give up the hopeless aim to achieve a single authoritative and defini\u00ad tive master-text of a literary work. Instead, the editor should select and edit a textual \"version\" of a work according to the circumstances of the particular case, and also according to whether the editor's purpose is to approximate what the author wrote, or else to reproduce the printed text as it existed for its readers when it was first published. For a concise survey of the history of textual theory and criticism, see D. C. Greetham, Textual Scholarship: An Introduction (1992). Greetham has also edited, for the Modern Language Association of America, Scholarly Editing: A Guide to Research (1995), which includes a survey, written by specialists, of the history and types of scholarly editing applied to classical literature, the Bible, and a number of foreign literatures, as well as to the various periods of English 320 THEORIES OF CRITICISM, CURRENT \u00b7 THREE UNITIES literature.

The entry in this Glossary on criticism de\u00ad scribes traditional types of literary theory and of applied criticism from Aris\u00ad totle through the early twentieth century. Since World War I, and especially since the 1960s, there have appeared a large number of innovative literary theories and methods of critical analysis, including revised and amplified ver\u00ad sions of the earlier forms of Marxist criticism and psychoanalytic criticism. An entry on each of these new critical modes is entered in the Glossary, according to the alphabetic order of its title. Following is a table of the approximate time when these modes became prominent in literary criticism: 1920s and 1930s Russian Formalism. 1930s and 1940s archetypal criticism. 1940s and 1950s New Criticism; phenomenological criticism. 1960s structuralist criticism; modern forms of feminist criticism; stylistics. 1970s theory of the anxiety of influence; postcolonial studies; queer theory. See the entry poststructuralism for the current signification of the term \"theory,\" as well as for a description of some critical perspectives and practices shared by many (but not all) of the theories that have appeared after the 1960s. Three Unities. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, critics of the drama in Italy and France added to Aristotle's unity of action, which he de\u00ad scribes in his Poetics, two other unities, to constitute one of the rules of drama known as \"the three unities.\" On the assumption that verisimilitude\u2014the achievement of an illusion of reality in the audience of a stage play\u2014requires that the action represented by a play approximate the actual conditions of the staging of the play, they imposed the requirement of the \"unity of place\" (that the action represented be limited to a single location) and the require\u00ad ment of the \"unity of time\" (that the time represented be limited to the two or three hours it takes to act the play, or at most to a single day of either TOUCHSTONE \u00b7 TRAGEDY twelve or twenty-four hours). In large part because of the potent example of Shakespeare, many of whose plays represent frequent changes of place and the passage of many years, the unities of place and time never dominated English neoclassicism as they did criticism in Italy and France. A final blow was the famous attack against them, and against the principle of dramatic verisimilitude on which they were based, in Samuel Johnson's \"Preface to Shakespeare\" (1765). Since then in England, the unities of place and time (as distinguished from the unity of action) have been regarded as entirely op\u00ad tional devices, available to the playwright to achieve special effects of dra\u00ad matic concentration. See Joel Spingarn, Literary Criticism in the Renaissance (rev., 1924); J. W. H. Atkins, English Literary Criticism: Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries (1957); Ren\u00e9 Wellek, A History of Modern Criticism, Vol. 1, The Later Eighteenth Century (1955); Bernard Weinberg, A History of Literary Criticism in the Italian Renais\u00ad sance (1961). Touchstone is a hard stone used to determine, by the streak left on it when rubbed by a piece of gold, whether the metal is pure gold, and if not, the de\u00ad gree to which it contains an alloy. The word was introduced into literary crit\u00ad icism by Matthew Arnold in \"The Study of Poetry\" (1880) to denote short but distinctive passages, selected from the writings of great poets, which he used to determine the excellence of passages or poems which are compared to them. Arnold proposed this method of evaluation as a corrective for what he called the \"fallacious\" estimates of poems according to their \"historic\" impor\u00ad tance in the development of literature, or else according to their \"personal\" appeal to an individual critic. As Arnold put it: There can be no more useful help for discovering what poetry belongs to the class of the truly excellent. .. than to have always in one's mind lines and expressions of the great masters, and to apply them as a touch\u00ad stone to other poetry.... If we have any tact we shall find them ... an infallible touchstone for detecting the presence or absence of high poetic quality, and also the degree of this quality, in all other poetry which we may place beside them. The touchstones he proposed are passages from Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, and Milton, ranging in length from one to four lines. Two of his best-known touchstones are also is our III. 85), and the close of Milton's descrip\u00ad tion in Paradise Lost, IV, 271-2, of the loss to Ceres of her daughter Proserpine, \"... which cost Ceres all that pain/To seek her through the world.\" Tragedy. The term is broadly applied to literary, and especially to dramatic, representations of serious actions which eventuate in a disastrous conclusion for the protagonist (the chief character). More precise and detailed discussions of the tragic form properly begin\u2014although they should not end\u2014with Aris\u00ad totle's classic analysis in the Poetics (fourth century B.C.). Aristotle based his theory on induction from the only examples available to him, the tragedies of TRAGEDY Greek dramatists such as Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. In the subse\u00ad quent two thousand years and more, many new and artistically effective types of serious plots ending in a catastrophe have been developed\u2014types that Aris\u00ad totle had no way of foreseeing. The many attempts to stretch Aristotle's analy\u00ad sis to apply to later tragic forms serve merely to blur his critical categories and to obscure important differences among diverse types of plays, all of which have proved to be dramatically effective. When flexibly managed, however, Aristotle's discussions apply in some part to many tragic plots, and his ana\u00ad lytic concepts serve as a suggestive starting point for identifying the differen\u00ad tiae of various non-Aristotelian modes of tragic construction. Aristotle defined tragedy as \"the imitation of an action that is serious and also, as having magnitude, complete in itself,\" in the medium of poetic lan\u00ad guage and in the manner of dramatic rather than of narrative presentation, involving \"incidents arousing pity and fear, wherewith to accomplish the catharsis of such emotions.\" (See imitation.) Precisely how to interpret Aristo\u00ad tle's catharsis\u2014which in Greek signifies \"purgation,\" or \"purification,\" or both\u2014is much disputed. On two matters, however, a number of commenta\u00ad tors agree. Aristotle in the first place sets out to account for the undeniable, though remarkable, fact that many tragic representations of suffering and de\u00ad feat leave an audience feeling not depressed, but relieved, or even exalted. In the second place, Aristotle uses this distinctive effect on the reader, which he calls \"the pleasure of pity and fear,\" as the basic way to distinguish the tragic from comic or other forms, and he regards the dramatist's aim to produce this effect in the highest degree as the principle that determines the choice and moral qualities of a tragic protagonist and the organization of the tragic plot. Accordingly, Aristotle says that the tragic hero will most effectively evoke both our pity and terror if he is neither thoroughly good nor thoroughly bad but a mixture of both; and also that this tragic effect will be stronger if the hero is \"better than we are,\" in the sense that he is of higher than ordinary moral worth. Such a man is exhibited as suffering a change in fortune from happiness to misery because of his mistaken choice of an action, to which he is led by his hamartia\u2014his \"error of judgment\" or, as it is often though less literally trans\u00ad lated, his tragic flaw. (One common form of hamartia in Greek tragedies was hubris, that \"pride\" or overweening self-confidence which leads a protagonist to disregard a divine warning or to violate an important moral law.) The tragic hero, like Oedipus in Sophocles' Oedipus the King, moves us to pity because, since he is not an evil man, his misfortune is greater than he deserves; but he moves us also to fear, because we recognize similar possibilities of error in our own lesser and fallible selves. Aristotle grounds his analysis of \"the very struc\u00ad ture and incidents of the play\" on the same principle; the plot, he says, which will most effectively evoke \"tragic pity and fear\" is one in which the events de\u00ad velop through complication to a catastrophe in which there occurs (often by an anagnorisis, or discovery of facts hitherto unknown to the hero) a sudden peripeteia, or reversal in his fortune from happiness to disaster. (See plot.) Authors in the Middle Ages lacked direct knowledge either of classical tragedies or of Aristotle's Poetics. Medieval tragedies are simply the story of a TRAGEDY person of high status who, whether deservedly or not, is brought from pros\u00ad perity to wretchedness by an unpredictable turn of the wheel of fortune. The short narratives in \"The Monk's Tale\" of The Canterbury Tales (late fourteenth century) are all, in Chaucer's own term, \"tragedies\" of this kind. With the Eliz\u00ad abethan era came both the beginning and the acme of dramatic tragedy in England. The tragedies of this period owed much to the native religious drama, the miracle and morality plays, which had developed independently of classical influence, but with a crucial contribution from the Roman writer Seneca (first century), whose dramas got to be widely known earlier than those of the Greek tragedians. Senecan tragedy was written to be recited rather than acted; but to En\u00ad glish playwrights, who thought that these tragedies had been intended for the stage, they provided the model for an organized five-act play with a complex plot and an elaborately formal style of dialogue. Senecan drama, in the Eliza\u00ad bethan Age, had two main lines of development. One of these consisted of ac\u00ad ademic tragedies written in close imitation of the Senecan model, including the use of a chorus, and usually constructed according to the rules of the three unities, which had been elaborated by Italian critics of the sixteenth century; the earliest English example was Thomas Sackville and Thomas Norton's Gor- boduc (1562). The other and much more important development was written for the popular stage, and is called the revenge tragedy, or (in its most sensa\u00ad tional form) the tragedy of blood. This type of play derived from Seneca's fa\u00ad vorite materials of murder, revenge, ghosts, mutilation, and carnage, but while Seneca had relegated such matters to long reports of offstage actions by messengers, the Elizabethan writers usually represented them on stage to sat\u00ad isfy the appetite of the contemporary audience for violence and horror. Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy (1586) established this popular form; its subject is a murder and the quest for vengeance, and it includes a ghost, in\u00ad sanity, suicide, a play-within-a-play, sensational incidents, and a gruesomely bloody ending. Christopher Marlowe's The Jew of Malta (c. 1592) and Shake\u00ad speare's Titus Andronicus (c. 1590) are in this mode; and from this lively but unlikely prototype came one of the greatest of tragedies, Hamlet, as well as John Webster's fine horror plays of 1612-13, The Duchess ofMalfi and The White Devil. Many major tragedies in the brief flowering time between 1585 and 1625, by Marlowe, Shakespeare, George Chapman, Webster, Sir Francis Beau\u00ad mont and John Fletcher, and Philip Massinger, deviate radically from the Aris\u00ad totelian norm. Shakespeare's Othello is one of the few plays which accords closely with Aristotle's basic concepts of the tragic hero and plot. The hero of Macbeth, however, is not a good man who commits a tragic error, but an am\u00ad bitious man who knowingly turns great gifts to evil purposes and therefore, although he retains something of our sympathy by his courage and self- insight, deserves his destruction at the hands of his morally superior antago\u00ad nists. Shakespeare's Richard III presents first the success, then the ruin, of a protagonist who is thoroughly malign, yet arouses in us a reluctant admira\u00ad tion by his intelligence and imaginative power and by the shameless candor 324 TRAGEDY with which he glories in his ambition and malice. Most Shakespearean tragedies, like Elizabethan tragedies generally, also depart from Aristotle's par\u00ad adigm by introducing humorous characters, incidents, or scenes, called comic relief which were in various ways and degrees made relevant to the tragic plot. There developed also in this age the mixed mode called tragicomedy, a popular non-Aristotelian form which produced a number of artistic successes. And later in the seventeenth century the Restoration Period produced the cu\u00ad rious genre, a cross between epic and tragedy, called heroic tragedy. Until the close of the seventeenth century almost all tragedies were writ\u00ad ten in verse and had as protagonists men of high rank whose fate affected the fortunes of a state. A few minor Elizabethan tragedies, such as A Yorkshire Tragedy (of uncertain authorship), had as the chief character a man of the lower class, but it remained for eighteenth-century writers to popularize the bourgeois or domestic tragedy, which was written in prose and presented a protagonist from the middle or lower social ranks who suffers a commonplace or domestic disaster. George Lillo's The London Merchant: or, The History of George Barnwell (1731), about a merchant's apprentice who succumbs to a heartless courtesan and comes to a bad end by robbing his employer and mur\u00ad dering his uncle, is still read, at least in college courses. Since that time most successful tragedies have been in prose and represent middle-class, or occasionally even working-class, heroes and heroines. The great and highly influential Norwegian playwright, Henrik Ibsen, wrote in the latter nineteenth century tragedies in prose, many of which (such as A Dolls House, Ghosts, An Enemy of the People) revolve around an issue of general social or polit\u00ad ical significance. One of the more notable modern tragedies, Arthur Miller's The Death of a Salesman (1949), relies for its tragic seriousness on the degree to which Willy Loman, in his bewildered defeat by life, is representative of the or\u00ad dinary man whose aspirations reflect the false values of a commercial society; the effect on the audience is one of compassionate understanding rather than of tragic pity and terror. The protagonists of some recent tragedies are not heroic but antiheroic, in that they manifest a character that is at an extreme from the dignity and courage of the protagonists in traditional dramas (see an- tihero); while in some recent works, tragic effects involve elements that were once specific to the genre of farce (see literature of the absurd and black comedy). Tragedy since World War I has also been innovative in other ways, in\u00ad cluding experimentation with new versions of ancient types. Eugene O'Neill's Mourning Becomes Electra (1931), for example, is an adaptation of Aeschylus' Oresteia, with the locale shifted from Greece to New England, the poetry al\u00ad tered to rather flat prose, and the tragedy of fate converted into a tragedy of the psychological compulsions of a family trapped in a tangle of Freudian complexes (see psychoanalysis). T. S. Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral (1935) is a tragic drama which, like Greek tragedy, is written in verse and has a chorus, but also incorporates elements of two early Christian forms, the medieval mir\u00ad acle play (dealing with the martyrdom of a saint) and the medieval morality play. A recent tendency, especially in the critics associated with the new his- toricism, has been to interpret traditional tragedies primarily in political TRAGICOMEDY 325 terms, as incorporating in the problems and catastrophe of the tragic individ\u00ad ual an indirect representation of contemporary social or ideological dilemmas and crises.

Palmer, Tragedy and Tragic Theory: An Analytical Guide (1992), is a useful survey of contested issues in the theory and criticism of tragedy, with many quotations by theorists from the ancient Greeks to the present. Tragicomedy. A type of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama which intermin\u00ad gled both the standard characters and subject matter and the standard plot- forms of tragedy and comedy. Thus, the important agents in tragicomedy included both people of high degree and people of low degree, even though, according to the reigning critical theory of that time, only upper-class charac\u00ad ters were appropriate to tragedy, while members of the middle and lower classes were the proper subject solely of comedy; see decorum. Also, tragicom\u00ad edy represented a serious action which threatened a tragic disaster to the pro\u00ad tagonist, yet, by an abrupt reversal of circumstance, turned out happily. As John Fletcher wrote in his preface to The Faithful Shepherdess (c. 1610), tragi\u00ad comedy \"wants [i.e., lacks] deaths, which is enough to make it no tragedy, yet brings some near it, which is enough to make it no comedy, which must be a representation of familiar people. ... A god is as lawful in [tragicomedy] as in a tragedy, and mean people as in a comedy.\" (See comedy and tragedy.) Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice is by these criteria a tragicomedy, be\u00ad cause it mingles people of the aristocracy with lower-class characters (such as the Jewish merchant Shylock and the clown Launcelot Gobbo), and also be\u00ad cause the developing threat of death to Antonio is suddenly reversed at the end by Portia's ingenious casuistry in the trial scene. Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher in Philaster, and numerous other plays on which they collabo\u00ad rated from about 1606 to 1613, inaugurated a mode of tragicomedy that em\u00ad ploys a romantic and fast-moving plot of love, jealousy, treachery, intrigue, and disguises, and ends in a melodramatic reversal of fortune for the protago\u00ad nists, who had hitherto seemed headed for a tragic catastrophe. Shakespeare wrote his late plays Cymbeline and The Winter's Tale, between 1609 and 1611, in this very popular mode of the tragicomic romance. The name \"tragicom\u00ad edy\" is sometimes applied also to plays with double plots, one serious and the other comic; see double plots, under plot. Refer to E. M. Waith, The Pattern of Tragicomedy in Beaumont and Fletcher (1952); M. T. Herrick, Tragicomedy (1955). Gordon MucMullan and Jonathan 326 TRANSCENDENTALISM IN AMERICA Hope have edited a collection of recent essays on The Politics of Tragicomedy: Shakespeare and After (1992). Transcendentalism in America. A philosophical and literary movement, centered in Concord and Boston, which was prominent in the intellectual and cultural life of New England from 1836 until just before the Civil War. It was inaugurated in 1836 by a Unitarian discussion group that came to be called the Transcendental Club. In the seven years or so that the group met at various houses, it included at one time or another Ralph Waldo Emerson, Bronson Alcott, Frederick Henry Hedge, W. E. Channing and W. H. Channing, Theodore Parker, Margaret Fuller, Elizabeth Peabody, George Ripley, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Thoreau, and Jones Very. A quarterly periodical The Dial (1840-44) printed many of the early essays, poems, and reviews by the Tran- scendentalists. Transcendentalism was neither a systematic nor a sharply definable phi\u00ad losophy, but rather an intellectual mode and emotional mood that was ex\u00ad pressed by diverse, and in some instances rather eccentric, voices. Modern historians of the movement tend to take as its central exponents Emerson (es\u00ad pecially in Nature, \"The American Scholar,\" the Over-Soul,\" and \"Self Reliance\") and Thoreau (especially in Waiden and his journals). The term \"transcendental,\" as Emerson pointed out in his lecture \"The Transcendentalist\" (1841), was taken from Immanuel Kant the German philosopher (1724-1804). Kant had confined the expression \"transcendental knowledge\" to the cognizance of those forms and categories\u2014such as space, time, quantity, causality\u2014which, in his view, are imposed on whatever we per\u00ad ceive by the constitution of all human minds; he regarded these aspects as the universal conditions of all sense-experience. Emerson and others, however, ex\u00ad tended the concept of transcendental knowledge, in a way whose validity Kant had specifically denied, to include an intuitive cognizance of moral and other truths that transcend the limits of human sense-experience. The intellectual antecedents of American Transcendentalism, in addition to Kant, were many and diverse, and included post-Kantian German Idealists, the English thinkers Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Thomas Carlyle (themselves exponents of forms of German Idealism), Plato and Neoplatonists, the occult Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg, and some varieties of Oriental philosophy. What the various Transcendentalists had in common was less what they proposed than what they were reacting against. By and large, they were op\u00ad posed to rigid rationalism; to eighteenth-century empirical philosophy of the school of John Locke, which derived all knowledge from sense impressions; to highly formalized religion, especially the Calvinist orthodoxy of New Eng\u00ad land; and to the social conformity, materialism, and commercialism that they found increasingly dominant in American life. Among the counter-views that were affirmed by Transcendentalists, especially Emerson, were confidence in the validity of a mode of knowledge that is grounded in feeling and intuition, and a consequent tendency to accept what, to logical reasoning, might seem contradictions; an ethics of individualism that stressed self-trust, self-reliance, UTOPIAS AND DYSTOPIAS 327 and self-sufficiency; a turn away from modern society, with its getting and spending, to the scenes and objects of the natural world, which were regarded both as physical facts and as correspondences to aspects of the human spirit (see conespondences); and, in place of a formal or doctrinal religion, a faith in a divine \"Principle,\" or \"Spirit,\" or \"Soul\" (Emerson's \"Over-Soul\") in which both humanity and the cosmos participate. This omnipresent Spirit, Emerson said, constitutes the \"Unity within which every man's particular being is con\u00ad tained and made one with all other\"; it manifests itself to human conscious\u00ad ness as influxes of inspired insights; and it is the source of the profoundest truths and the necessary condition of all moral and spiritual development. Waiden (1854) records how Thoreau tested his distinctive and radically individualist version of Transcendental values by withdrawing from societal complexities and distractions to a life of solitude and self-reliance in a natural setting at Waiden Pond. He simplified his material wants to those he could satisfy by the bounty of the woods and lake or could provide by his own labor, attended minutely to natural objects in the material world both for their in\u00ad herent interest and as correlatives to the mind of the observer, and devoted his leisure to reading, meditation, and writing. In his nonconformity to social and legal requirements that violated his moral sense, he chose a day in jail rather than pay his poll tax to a government that supported the Mexican War and slavery. Brook Farm, on the other hand, was a short-lived experiment (1841-47) by more community-oriented Transcendentalists who established a commune on the professed principle of the equal sharing of work, pay, and cultural benefits. Hawthorne, who lived there for a while, later wrote about Brook Farm, with considerable skepticism about both its goals and practices, in The Blithedale Romance (1852). The Transcendental movement, with its optimism about the indwelling divinity, self-sufficiency, and high potentialities of human nature, did not survive the crisis of the Civil War and its aftermath; and Melville, like Hawthorne, satirized aspects of Transcendentalism in his fiction. Some of its basic concepts and values, however, were assimilated by Walt Whitman, were later echoed in writings by Henry James and other major American authors, and continue to re-emerge, in both liberal and radical modes, in latter-day America. The voice of Thoreau, for example, however distorted, can be recog\u00ad nized still in some doctrines of the counterculture of the 1960s and later. See periods of American literature, and refer to Octavius B. Frothingham, Transcendentalism in New England (1876); Harold C. Goddard, Studies in New England Transcendentalism (1908); F. O. Matthiessen, American Renaissance (1941); the anthology edited, together with commentary, by Perry Miller, The Transcendentalists (1950); Joel Porte, Emerson and Thoreau: Transcendentalists in Conflict (1966); Lawrence Buell, Literary Transcendentalism: Style and Vision in the American Renaissance (1973). Utopias and Dystopias. The term utopia designates the class of fictional writings that represent an ideal but nonexistent political and social way of life. It derives from Utopia (1515-16), a book written in Latin by the Renaissance 328 VICTORIAN AND VICTORIANISM humanist Sir Thomas More which describes a perfect commonwealth; More formed his title by conflating the Greek words \"eutopia\" (good place) and \"outopia\" (no place). The first and greatest instance of the literary type was Plato's Republic (latter fourth century B.C.), which sets forth, in dialogue, the eternal Idea or Form of a commonwealth that can at best be merely approxi\u00ad mated by political organizations in the actual world. Most utopias, like that of Sir Thomas More, represent their ideal state in the fiction of a distant country reached by a venturesome traveler. There have been many utopias written since More gave impetus to the genre, some as mere Arcadian dreams, others intended as blueprints for social and technological improvements in the actual world. They include Tommaso Campanula's City of the Sun (1623), Francis Bacon's New Atlantis (1627), Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward (1888), William Morris' News from Nowhere (1891), Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Herland (1915), and James Hilton's Lost Horizon (1934). The utopia can be distinguished from literary representations of imagi\u00ad nary places which, either because they are inordinately superior to the pres\u00ad ent world or manifest exaggerated versions of some of its unsavory aspects, serve primarily as vehicles for satire on contemporary human life and society; notable examples are the fourth book of Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726) and Samuel (1759) presents the \"Happy Valley,\" which functions as a gentle satire on humanity's stubborn but hopeless dream of a utopia. Not only does Rasselas discover that no mode of life available in this world guarantees happiness; he also realizes that the Utopian satisfaction of all human wishes in the Happy Valley serves merely to replace the unhappiness of frustrated desires with the unhappiness of bore\u00ad dom; see chapters 1-3. The term dystopia (\"bad place\") has recently come to be applied to works of fiction, including science fiction, that represent a very unpleasant imaginary world in which ominous tendencies of our present social, political, and technological order are projected into a disastrous future culmination. Examples are Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932), George Orwell's 1984 (1949), and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale (1986). Ursula K. LeGuin's The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia (1974) contains both Utopian and dystopian scenarios. For utopias and dystopias based on future developments in science and technology, see science fiction. Refer to J. O. Hertzler, The History of Utopian Thought (1923); Lewis Mumford The Story of Utopias (1922); Karl Mannheim, Ideology and Utopia (1934); Chad Walsh, From Utopia to Nightmare (1962); Nell Eurich, Science in Utopia (1967); and the anthology Utopian Literature: A Selec\u00ad tion, ed. J. W. Johnson (1960). Francis Bartkowski has analyzed Feminist Utopias (1989), from Charlotte Perkin Gilman's Herland (1915) to the present. Victorian and Victorianism. In its value-neutral use, \"Victorian\" simply identifies the historical era in England roughly coincident with the reign of Queen Victoria, 1837-1901. (See Victorian period, under periods of English litera\u00ad ture.) It was a time of rapid and wrenching economic and social changes that WIT, HUMOR, AND THE COMIC 329 had no parallel in earlier history\u2014changes that made England, in the course of the nineteenth century, the leading industrial power, with an empire that occu\u00ad pied more than a quarter of the earth's surface. The pace and depth of such de\u00ad velopments, while they fostered a mood of nationalist pride and optimism about future progress, also produced social stresses, turbulence, and widespread anxiety about the ability of the nation and the individual to cope, socially, po\u00ad litically, and psychologically, with the cumulative problems of the age. England was the first nation to exploit the technological possibilities of steam power and steel, but its unregulated industrialization, while it pro\u00ad duced great wealth for an expanding middle class, led also to the deteriora\u00ad tion of rural England, a mushroom growth of often shoddy urbanization, and massive poverty concentrated in slum neighborhoods. Charles Darwin's the\u00ad ory of evolution (On the Origin of Species was published in 1859), together with the extension into all intellectual areas of positivism (the view that all valid knowledge must be based on the methods of empirical investigation estab\u00ad lished by the natural sciences), engendered sectarian controversy, doubts about the truth of religious beliefs, and in some instances, a reversion to strict biblical fundamentalism. Contributing to the social and political unrest was what was labeled \"the woman question\"; that is, the early feminist agitation for equal status and rights. The Victorian age, for all its conflicts and anxieties, was one of immense, variegated, and often self-critical intellectual and literary activities. In our time, the term \"Victorian,\" and still more Victorianism, is frequently used in a derogatory way, to connote narrow-mindedness, sexual priggishness, the determination to maintain feminine \"innocence\" (that is, sexual ignorance), narrow-mindedness, and an emphasis on social respectability. Such views have a valid basis in attitudes and values expressed (and sometimes exempli\u00ad fied) by many members of the expanding middle class, with its roots in Puri\u00ad tanism and its insecurity about its newly won status. Later criticism of such Victorian attitudes, however, merely echo the vigorous attacks and devastat\u00ad ing ridicule mounted by a number of thinkers and literary writers in the Vic\u00ad torian age itself. Refer to G. M. Young, Victorian England: Portrait of an Age (republished 1977); David Thomson, England in the Nineteenth Century (1950); Jerome Buck\u00ad ley, The Victorian Temper (1951); W. E. Houghton, The Victorian Frame of Mind (1957). On Victorian attitudes to love and sexuality see Peter Gay, The Bour\u00ad geois Experience, Victoria to Freud, Vol. 1, Education of the Senses (1984), and Vol. 2, The Tender Passion (1986); and on the undercover side of Victorian sexual life, Steven Marcus, The Other Victorians (republished 1974). Wit, Humor, and the Comic. At present both \"wit\" and \"humor\" desig\u00ad nate species of the comic: any element in a work of literature, whether a char\u00ad acter, event, or utterance, which is designed to amuse or to excite mirth in the reader or audience. The words \"wit\" and \"humor,\" however, had a variety of meanings in earlier literary criticism, and a brief comment on their history will help to clarify the differences between them in present usage. 330 WIT, HUMOR, AND THE COMIC The term \"wit\" once signified the human faculty of intelligence, inven\u00ad tiveness, and mental acuity, a sense it still retains in the term \"half-wit.\" In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it came to be used also for ingenuity in lit\u00ad erary invention, and especially for the ability to develop brilliant, surprising, and paradoxical figures of speech; hence \"wit\" was often applied to the figura\u00ad tive language in the kind of writing we now call metaphysical poetry. And in the eighteenth century there were attempts to distinguish the false wit of Abra\u00ad ham Cowley and other metaphysical stylists, who were said to aim at a merely superficial dazzlement, and \"true wit,\" regarded as the apt rephrasing of truths whose enduring validity is attested by the fact that they are commonplaces. Thus Alexander Pope defined \"true wit\" in his Essay on Criticism (1711) as \"What oft was thought, but ne'er so well expressed.\" (See under neoclassica) The most common present use of the term derives from its seventeenth- century application to a brilliant and paradoxical style. Wit, that is, now de\u00ad notes a kind of verbal expression which is brief, deft, and intentionally contrived to produce a shock of comic surprise; its typical form is that of the epigram. (See epigram.) The surprise is usually the result of a connection or distinction between words or concepts which frustrates the listener's expecta\u00ad tion, only to satisfy it in an unexpected way. Philip Guedalla wittily said: \"History repeats itself. Historians repeat each other.\" Thus the trite comment about history turns out to be unexpectedly appropriate, with an unlooked-for turn of meaning, to the writers of history as well. Once Mae West remarked that \"too much of a good thing can be wonderful.\" The resulting laughter, in a famous phrase of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant, arises \"from the sudden transformation of a strained expectation into nothing\"; it might be more precise to say, however, \"from the sudden satisfaction of an expectation, but in a way we did not expect.\" Mae West's remark is what the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud called \"harmless wit,\" which evokes a laugh or smile that is without malice. What Freud distinguished as \"tendency wit,\" on the other hand, is aggressive: it is a derisive and derogatory turn of phrase, directing the laugh at a particular per\u00ad son or butt. \"Mr. James Payn,\" in Oscar Wilde's barbed comment on a con\u00ad temporary novelist of the 1890s, \"hunts down the obvious with the enthusiasm of a short-sighted detective. As one turns over the pages, the sus\u00ad pense of the author becomes almost unbearable.\" Repartee is a term taken from fencing to signify a contest of wit, in which each person tries to cap the remark of the other, or to turn it to his or her own advantage. Attacking Disraeli in Parliament, Gladstone remarked that \"the honorable gentleman will either end on the gallows or die of some loathsome disease.\" To which Disraeli rejoined: \"That depends on whether I embrace the honorable gentleman's principles or his mistresses.\" Restoration comedies often included episodes of sustained repartee; a classic example is the give and take in the discussion of their coming marriage by the witty lovers Mirabel and Millamant in William Congreve's The Way of the World (1700), Act IV. WIT, HUMOR, AND THE COMIC \"Humor\" is a term that goes back to the ancient theory that the particu\u00ad lar mixture of the four humours determines each type of personality, and from the derivative application of the term \"humorous\" to one of the comically ec\u00ad centric characters in the Elizabethan comedy of humours. As we now use the word, humor may be ascribed either to a comic utterance or to a comic ap\u00ad pearance or mode of behavior. In a useful distinction between the two terms, a humorous utterance may be said to differ from a witty utterance in one or both of two ways: (1) wit, as we saw, is always intended by the speaker to be comic, but many speeches that we find comically humorous are intended by the speakers themselves to be serious; and (2) a humorous saying is not cast in the neatly epigrammatic form of a witty saying. For example, the chatter of the old Nurse in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is verbose, and humorous to the audience, but not to the speaker; similarly, the discussion of the mode of life of the goldfish in Central Park by the inarticulate and irascible taxi driver inj. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye (1951) is unintentionally but superbly humorous, and is not cast in the form of a witty turn of phrase. More important still is the difference that wit refers only to the spoken or written word, while humor has a much broader range of reference. We find humor, for example, in the way Charlie Chaplin looks, dresses, and acts, and also in the sometimes wordless cartoons in The New Yorker. In a thoroughly humorous situation, the sources of the fun may be complex. In Act III, Scene iv of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Malvolio's appearance and actions, and his utterances as well, are humorous, but all despite his own very solemn inten\u00ad tions; and our comic enjoyment is increased by our knowledge of the sup\u00ad pressed hilarity of the plotters who are hidden auditors onstage. The greatness of a comic creation like Shakespeare's Falstaff is that he exploits the full gamut of comic possibilities. Falstaff is humorous in the way he looks and in what he does; what he says is sometimes witty, and at almost all other times humor\u00ad ous; while his actions and speech are sometimes unintentionally humorous, sometimes intentionally humorous, and not infrequently\u2014as in his whimsi\u00ad cal account to his skeptical auditors of how he bore himself in the highway robbery, in the second act of 1 Henry IV\u2014 they are humorous even beyond his intention. One other point should be made about humor and the comic. In the normal use, the term \"humor\" refers to what is purely comic: it evokes, as it is sometimes said, sympathetic laughter, or else laughter which is an end in itself. If we extend Freud's distinction between harmless and tendency wit, we can say that humor is a \"harmless\" form of the comic. There is, however, another mode of the comic that might be called \"tendency comedy,\" in which we are made to laugh at a person not merely because he is ridiculous, but because he is being ridiculed\u2014the laughter is derisive, with some ele\u00ad ment of contempt or malice, and serves as a weapon against its subject. Ten\u00ad dency comedy and tendency wit, rather than humor, are among the devices that a writer most exploits in satire, the literary art of derogating by deriding a subject. 332 WIT, HUMOR, AND THE COMIC On the alternative use of the term \"comic\" to define the formal features of a type of dramatic or narrative plot, see comedy; on the widespread form of humor-in-horror in present-day literature, see black humor.

Tave, The Ami\u00ad able Humorist (1960); Jerry Palmer, Taking Humor Seriously (1994). ^ Incieli of Authors ^ This Index lists significant references to authors; it does not include pass\u00ad ing references, or the authors listed for supplementary reading.
