On this page [Skip this page navigation](#toc-end) Effective February 10, 2022 This Minister's Directive is issued pursuant to section 174.1 of the [Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007](/laws/statute/07l08), which authorizes the Minister of Long-Term Care to issue operational or policy directives respecting long-term care homes where the Minister considers it in the public interest to do so. Every licensee of a long-term care home shall carry out every operational or policy directive that applies to the long-term care home. This directive updates and replaces the previous version of this directive dated January 27, 2022. This directive sets out requirements for proof of vaccination against COVID19 for people working (including as staff and support workers), undertaking a student placement, volunteering, or visiting at long-term care homes. Vaccination remains the best defence against COVID19, and combined with other measures and actions, high vaccination rates can help prevent and limit the spread of this virus in homes. Vaccination against COVID19 helps reduce the number of new cases, and, most importantly, reduces severe outcomes including hospitalizations and death due to COVID19 in both residents and others who may be present in a long-term care home. For definitions applicable to this directive, please refer to the [Definitions section](#section-8).
