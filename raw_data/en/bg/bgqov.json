They are becoming an increasingly popular and complementary/alternative therapy to traditional western medicine. I currently offer Holistic Therapies - Reiki Healing and Reiki Crystal Healing. Please find below information on these therapies: Reiki is a 'hands-on' energy-based healing therapy which supports and encourages natural self-healing abilities, whilst promoting a feeling of deep relaxation, harmony and well-being. You can experience this wonderfully peaceful healing treatment whilst you relax on the therapy couch or in a chair, leaving you feeling refreshed and re-balanced. It is believed to help balance the body's natural energy systems, helping to correct energy flow through the meridians, channels, chakras and auras as needed; to bring an improved sense of health, vitality and well-being. Boosting the body's innate ability to heal itself, helping to alleviate the effects of pain and suffering, leaving you more able to cope with the stresses and strains of daily living. Reiki Crystal Healing has all the benefits of Reiki with the addition of incorporating intuitively chosen crystals, to further complement the healing process. Reiki Distant Healing offers you the opportunity to receive Reiki Healing/Reiki Crystal Healing, wherever you are. It can also be an effective method for children, pets and in chronic/traumatic situations where travel may not possible. Distant Healing is just as effective as a 'hands on treatment' and includes telephone consultation, healing, telephone feedback with guidance and personalised well-being suggestions. These deeply relaxing therapeutic treatments can also be blended with conventional therapies, such as Counselling, Psychotherapy CBT, EMDR Therapy and Hypnotherapy, if considered beneficial. Your initial session will form our introduction, contract and consultation, followed by Reiki Healing/Reiki Crystal Healing, feedback, guidance and personalised well-being suggestions, a 90 minute appointment. Further healing sessions are bespoke, tailored according to your needs, also taking 90 minutes. Each session will help you gain clarity and focus on your life path and leave you feeling relaxed, refreshed and re-energised with a greater sense of well-being.
