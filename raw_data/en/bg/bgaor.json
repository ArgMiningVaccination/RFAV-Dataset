S HERIDAN ,PHD Objective: The underlying changes in biological processes that are associated with reported changes in mental and physical health in response to meditation have not been systematically explored. We performed a randomized, controlled study on the effects onbrain and immune function of a well-known and widely used 8-week clinical training program in mindfulness meditation appliedin a work environment with healthy employees. Methods: We measured brain electrical activity before and immediately after, and then 4 months after an 8-week training program in mindfulness meditation. Twenty-five subjects were tested in the meditationgroup. A wait-list control group ( N/H1100516) was tested at the same points in time as the meditators. At the end of the 8-week period, subjects in both groups were vaccinated with influenza vaccine. Results: We report for the first time significant increases in left-sided anterior activation, a pattern previously associated with positive affect, in the meditators compared with the nonmedi-tators. We also found significant increases in antibody titers to influenza vaccine among subjects in the meditation compared withthose in the wait-list control group. Finally, the magnitude of increase in left-sided activation predicted the magnitude of antibodytiter rise to the vaccine. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that a short program in mindfulness meditation produces demonstrable effects on brain and immune function. These findings suggest that meditation may change brain and immune functionin positive ways and underscore the need for additional research. Key words: meditation, mindfulness, EEG, immune function, brain asymmetry, the widespread and growing use of meditative prac- tices in hospitals and academic medical centers for outpatients presenting with a range of chronic stress andpain-related disorders and chronic diseases, under the um-brella of what has come to be called mind/body or integrativemedicine, the question of possible biological mechanisms bywhich meditation may affect somatic, cognitive, and affectiveprocesses becomes increasingly important. Research on thebiological concomitants of meditation practice is sparse andhas mostly focused on changes that occur during a period ofmeditation compared with a resting control condition in asingle experimental session (1-3). Whereas these studies havebeen informative, they tell us little about changes that arepotentially more enduring. Moreover, virtually all forms ofmeditation profess to alter everyday behavior, effects that areby definition not restricted to the times during which formalmeditation itself is practiced. Thus, in the current report, we focus not on the period of meditation itself, but rather on themore enduring changes that can be detected in baseline brainfunction as well as brain activity in response to specificemotional challenges. We focus on emotion-related brain activity because medi- tation has been found in numerous studies to reduce anxietyand increase positive affect (4-8). In an extensive corpus ofwork on the functional neuroanatomical substrates of emotionand affective style, we have established that the frontal regionsof the brain exhibit a specialization for certain forms ofpositive and negative emotion (9, 10). Left-sided activation inseveral anterior regions is observed during certain forms of positive emotion and in subjects with more dispositional pos-itive affect (10, 11). We therefore hypothesized that becausemeditation decreases anxiety and increases positive affect,subjects who were practicing meditation should show in-creased left-sided activation in these territories compared withthose in a wait-list control group. Recent studies have established that greater relative left- sided anterior activation at baseline is associated with en-hanced immune function using measures of NK activity (12,13). There has been a paucity of serious research attention topossible immune alterations that might be produced by med-itation (14). This is somewhat surprising in light of the factthat negative psychosocial influences on immunity have nowbeen well established (15-17). Recent research indicates thatrelaxation and stress management procedures increase T-cy-totoxic/suppressor (CD3 /H11001CD) lymphocytes in HIV-infected men (18). On the basis of recent research demonstrating thenegative impact of stressful life events on antibody titers inresponse to influenza vaccine (19), we vaccinated all subjectsat the end of the 8-week meditation program (in mid Novem-ber), along with the subjects in wait-list control group at thesame time. We hypothesized that the meditators would showgreater antibody titers in response to the vaccine comparedwith the subjects in the wait-list control group.

METHODS Measures of brain electrical activity were recorded before random assign- ment to each of the two groups (Time 1) and then again immediately after(Time 2) and four months after (Time 3) the training period ended. Brainelectrical activity, or EEG, and EOG (for correcting EEG for eye movements)was recorded during both baseline conditions and in response to a positive andnegative emotion induction using methods that have been extensively de-scribed in previous research (20, 21). EEG was recorded from 27 sitesdistributed across the scalp and referenced to linked ears during 8 1-minutebaseline trials, four with eyes open and four with eyes closed, presented incounterbalanced order according to our established procedures (22). EEG wasalso recorded during a 1-minute period before and a 3-minute period aftersubjects wrote about one of three of the most positive and negative experi-ences in their life. These events were listed on a questionnaire administered tosubjects before the start of the entire protocol. For this task, the EEG wasaggregated across the 1-minute period before and the 3-minute period after thewriting itself. Data were not collected during writing because of movementartifact. The EEG was parsed into 1.024-second epochs, overlapped by 50%and then processed with the use of a fast Hartley transform method to derivemeasures of spectral power density in the /H9251-band (8-13 Hz), which is inversely related to activation (20, 22). Asymmetric activation was indexedusing an asymmetry score that is computed by subtracting log-transformedleft hemisphere /H9251-power densities from the comparable measure derived from homologous right-sided electrodes. After each of the writing periods, subjects were given the PANAS (23) in state form. In addition, at each assessment, they were administered thePANAS in trait form, along with the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inven-tory (24) in trait form. In addition, subjects in the meditation group were askedto provide daily reports of the frequency and number of minutes and tech-niques of formal meditation practice. Blood draws were then obtained at 3 to 5 weeks and then again at 8 to 9 weeks after vaccination to examine antibody titers in response to the vaccineusing the hemagglutination inhibition assay (19). A total of 48 right-handed subjects who were employees of a biotechnol- ogy corporation in Madison, Wisconsin, were recruited to participate. Ofthese, 41 subjects completed some of the measures for at least two of theassessments. The initial laboratory evaluation was conducted before randomgroup assignment. Subjects were then randomly assigned to the meditationgroup ( N/H1100525; 19 female) and the wait-list control group ( N/H1100516; 10 female) at a ratio of approximately 3:2. There were no differences between groups inthe number of subjects who failed to complete the study. Average age ofsubjects was 36 years and did not differ between group (range /H1100523 to 56 years). All but two subjects were white (one Asian-American in the treatmentgroup; one South Asian Indian in the control group). Subjects in the wait-listcontrol group were evaluated at each assessment period along with subjects inthe meditation group. After completion of the last assessment, the wait-listcontrol subjects were provided with an 8-week training program comparableto that provided to the subjects in the meditation group. The meditation training (known as MBSR) was delivered by J.K.-Z., and was directly modeled on the MBSR intervention originally developed at theUniversity of Massachusetts Medical Center (25, 26). The effects of MBSRhave been reported in numerous clinical studies with diverse populations, aswell as in medical students (27, 28). One study demonstrated significanteffects of mindfulness on the rate of skin clearing in patients with moderateto severe psoriasis (29) Two recent reviews of MBSR research called forstudies to elucidate potential mechanisms of action (30, 31). The training consisted of a class that met weekly for 2.5 to 3 hours per class, along with a silent seven-hour retreat that was held during week 6 of thecourse. In addition, subjects were assigned home practice that consisted offormal and informal meditative practices that they were instructed to perform for 1 hour per day, 6 days per week, with the aid of guided audiotapes. The statistical analysis of the data focused on the interactions between group (Meditation/Wait-list control) and time (Times 1-3, with the firstassessment occurring before the intervention, Time 2 occurring immediatelyafter the 8-week intervention and Time 3 occurring four months after thetraining period ended. MANOVAs were computed for each of the fouranterior asymmetry measures. In addition to examining main effects and theinteraction, linear trends were also tested. Follow-up ANOVAs on the sepa-rate time periods were performed. RESULTS Affect and Anxiety Measures We evaluated self-report measures of positive and negative affect and anxiety before and after the training. There was asignificant Group /H11003Time interaction [ F(1,31)/H110055.45, p/H11021 .05] on a measure of trait anxiety, the Spielberger State-TraitAnxiety Inventory (24), accounted for by a reduction in anx-iety for subjects in the meditation group from Time 1 to Time2[t(20)/H110052.86, p/H11021.01; see Figure 1). There was no significant Group /H11003Time interaction on the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (23). However, in light of the clear apriori predictions for the meditators to show significant de-creases in negative affect with treatment, we tested changeover time within each group. There was a significant decreasein trait negative affect with the mediators showing less nega-tive affect at Times 2 and 3 compared with their negativeaffect at Time 1 [ t(20)/H110052.27 and t(21)/H110052.45, respectively, p/H11021.05 for both; not shown]. Subjects in the control group showed no change over time in negative affect ( t/H110211). Brain Electrical Activity Measures Based on previous findings linking asymmetric anterior activation to positive affect, we specifically examined changesin four anterior electrode sites (F3/4, FC7/8, periodsand in response to the emotion inductions. We computedMANOVAs with Group and Time (Times 1-3) as factors andexamined main effects and interactions, as well as linear Fig. 1.

Error bars reflectmeans/H11006SE.BRAIN AND IMMUNE FUNCTION IN MEDITATION 565 Psychosomatic Medicine 65:564-570 (2003)trends. For the baseline period assessments, there was a mar- ginally significant Group /H11003Time linear trend ( F(1,33)/H11005 3.73, p/H11005.06) and a significant main effect for Group (across time periods; F(1,33)/H110054.57, p/H11005.04). When the comparison of change from baseline for each time period was examined,there was a significant Group /H11003Time interaction [ F(1,37)/H11005 5.14, p/H11021.05] for the Time 1-3 comparison and a marginally significant Group /H11003Time interaction [ F(1,33)/H110052.82, p/H11005 .10] for the Time 1-Time 2 comparison for the central leads(C3/4). At Time 1, no group differences were present atbaseline for any region. At both Time 2 and Time 3, medita-tors showed significantly greater relative left-sided activationat the central sites compared with the wait-list controlgroup ( p/H11021.05 for each; see Figure 2). MANOVA performed on the positive emo- tion induction condition revealed a marginally significantoverall Group /H11003Time [ F(2,26)/H110052.52, p/H11005.10] for the anterior temporal (T3/4) electrode leads. When thecomparison of change from baseline for each time period wasexamined, there was a significant Group /H11003Time interaction [F(1,30)/H110054.82, p/H11021.05] for the Time 1-Time 2 comparison. This same interaction for the Time 1-Time 3 comparison wasmarginally significant and in the same direction [ F(1,29)/H11005 3.46, p/H11005.07]. In response to the positive emotion induction at Time 1, no group differences were present in any region.However, meditators showed a significant increase in left-sided anterior temporal activation from Time 1 to Time 2 ( p/H11021 .05), whereas controls showed no change (Figure 3). Therewere no other significant Group /H11003Time interactions for any other electrode site for the positive emotion induction. In response to the negative affect induction, the omnibus MANOVA revealed a marginally significant linear trendfor the Group /H11003Time interaction [ F(1,27)/H110052.94, p/H11021.10] for the anterior temporal leads. The Group /H11003Time inter- action for the Time 1-Time 2 comparison for the anteriortemporal region (T3/4) was again in the same direction asthe other interactions, but not significant [ F(1,31)/H110053.16, p/H11005.08]. In response to the negative emotion induction for the cen- tral leads, an omnibus MANOVA revealed a marginally sig-nificant Group /H11003Time interaction [ F(2,32)/H110052.78, p/H11021.08], along with a marginally significant linear trend for this inter-action [ F(1,33)/H110053.45, p/H11005.07]. In addition, there was a significant main effect for Group [ F(1,33)/H110056.78, p/H11005.01]. For the central leads, the Group /H11003Time interaction for the Time 1-Time 2 comparison was F(1,33)/H110053.62, p/H11005.07, and for the Time 1-Time 3 comparison it was F(1,37)/H110055.41, p/H11021 .05. Again, there were no group differences in any region atTime 1. At Times 2 and 3, subjects in the meditation groupshowed significantly greater left-sided activation (C3/C4)compared with subjects in the control group (for Time 2: p/H11021 .05; for Time 3: p/H11021.01). The meditators evinced a significant increase in left-sided activation in this region from Time 1 toTime 2 ( p/H11021.05; not shown) and Time 3 ( p/H11021.05: Figure 4). There were no group differences present for any of the posterior electrodes sites for any of the conditions. Influenza Vaccine Antibody Titers In response to the influenza vaccine, the meditators dis- played a significantly greater rise in antibody titers from the 4to the 8 week blood draw compared with the controls [ t(33)/H11005 2.05, p/H11021.05; Figure 5]. Fig. 2. Means /H11006SE of asymmetric activation during baseline for subjects in the Meditation group and Control group during Time 1 (before random assignment, before treatment began) and Time 3. The ordinate is an asymmetric metric that represents right minus left log-transformed /H9251power density from the C4/C3 electrode sites. This is a standard index of asymmetric activation (20). Higher numbers on this indicate greater left-sided activation.R. J. DAVIDSON et al. 566 Psychosomatic Medicine 65:564-570 (2003)Relations Among Measures To examine the relation between the magnitude of increase in left anterior activation and the magnitude of antibody titerrise in response to the influenza vaccine from the 4- to 8-weekblood draw, we computed a change score for each subject toexpress the change in activation asymmetry from Time 1 to Times 2 and 3 and correlated the change in activation asym-metry with the rise in antibody titers, separately for eachgroup. Among subjects in the meditation group, those whoshowed a greater increase in left-sided activation from Time 1 Fig. 3. Means /H11006SE asymmetric activation (in the T3/T4 electrode sites) in response to the positive emotion induction in the Meditation group and Control group during Times 1 and 2. The ordinate is the same metric of asymmetric activation displayed in Figure 2. Fig. 4. Means /H11006SE asymmetric activation in response to the negative emotion induction in the Meditation group and Control group during Times 1 and 3. The ordinate is the same metric of asymmetric activation displayed in Figure 2 (C3/C4).BRAIN AND IMMUNE FUNCTION IN MEDITATION 567 Psychosomatic Medicine 65:564-570 (2003)to Time 2 displayed a larger rise in antibody titers ( r/H11005.53,p /H11021.05; see Figure 6) while there was no significant relation between these variables for subjects in the control group ( r/H11005 .26). These correlations were not significantly different. We also examined correlations between the frequency and duration of reported practice and changes in the self-reportand EEG measures that showed significant Group /H11003Time interactions, as well as antibody titers to influenza vaccine.There were no significant associations between the measuresof practice and any of the biological or self-report measures.Descriptive statistics on these measures of daily practice areprovided in Table 1. Fig. 5. Means /H11006SE antibody rise from the 3- to 5-week to the 8- to 9-week blood draw in the Meditation and Control groups. The ordinate displays the difference in the log-transformed antibody rise between the 3- to 5- and the 8- to 9-week blood draws derived from the hemagglutination inhibitionassay. Fig. 6. Scatter plot for the meditation group only showing the relation between the change in asymmetric anterior activation at baseline from Time 1 to Time 2 in C3/C4 and the magnitude of rise in antibody titers to the influenza vaccine from the week 3 to 5 to the week 8 to 9 blood draw. The meditatorsthat showed the largest magnitude increase in left-sided anterior activation from Time 1 to Time 2 also showed the largest rise in antibody titers fromthe 3- to 5- to 8- to 9-week blood draws. There was no significant relation between these variables in the control group.R. J. DAVIDSON et al. 568 Psychosomatic Medicine 65:564-570 (2003)DISCUSSION These findings are the first to document significant changes in anterior activation asymmetry as a function of meditationtraining. A variety of previous research has established thatactivation asymmetries in anterior scalp regions are related todispositional affect. Moreover, such asymmetries reflect bothstate and trait components (32, 33) with both phasic positivemood as well as dispositional positive affect associated withgreater relative left-sided anterior activation. On the basis ofan extensive corpus of both animal and human data, Davidsonand colleagues recently suggested (33) that prefrontal activa-tion asymmetries are plastic and could be shaped by training.The findings from this study are the first to suggest thatmeditation can produce increases in relative left-sided anterioractivation that are associated with reductions in anxiety andnegative affect and increases in positive affect. We predicted that we would find significant changes in prefrontal as well as central electrode locations. It is unclearwhy our most consistent findings were observed at the centralleads (C3/C4), although this is a region where we have ob-served reliable affect-related asymmetries in the past (11).Moreover, we have found robust asymmetric increases in leftpremotor activation in response to positive emotional picturesin a study that measured regional glucose metabolism withpositron emission tomography (34). The fact that there was nosignificant increase in dispositional positive affect in the med-itation group may be related to the failure to detect increasesin left prefrontal activation. It may well be that if the durationand/or intensity of the intervention were increased, the in-creases would be observed in both positive affect and leftprefrontal activation. It is of interest that we observed reliable increases in left-sided activation with training in the meditation group inresponse to both the positive andnegative affect induction. We have suggested on the basis of a growing literature on theneural bases of emotion regulation that left-sided anterioractivation is associated with more adaptive responding tonegative and/or stressful events. Specifically, individuals withgreater left-sided anterior activation have been found to showfaster recovery after a negative provocation (see Refs. 32 and33 for reviews). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a reliable effect of meditation on an in vivo measure of immunefunction. The finding may reflect a relatively more rapid peakrise in antibody titers among the meditators compared with thecontrols. The observation that the magnitude of change inimmune function was greater for those subjects showing thelarger shift toward left-sided activation further supports earlier associations between these indices (12, 13). There are several limitations of our study that are important to note. First, there was a relatively small number of subjectswho participated and this limited our statistical power. Anumber of our hypothesized effects were in the predicteddirection, but failed to reach significance. Second, the studyexamined the impact of a relatively brief intervention deliv-ered in a demanding work environment during regular busi-ness hours. It will be of interest in the future to examine thechanges in brain and immune function produced by MBSR ormore intensive training in a more conducive learning environ-ment. And, finally, the measures of brain function we obtainedare relatively crude (see Ref. 20 for a discussion of theirlimitations). Future studies should examine the impact ofmeditation using more neuroanatomically informative mea-sures of brain function such as functional magnetic resonanceimaging. Our findings indicate that a short training program in mindfulness meditation (MBSR) has demonstrable effects onbrain and immune function and underscores the need foradditional research on the biological consequences of thisintervention.
