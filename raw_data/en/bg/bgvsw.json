Century after century th eologians, medievalists, constitutional lawyers, historians, poets and playwrights have returned to rework the original sources - which include no less than eight contemporary biographies and hundreds of letters. Myth has bred myth: from the astounding fertility o f Becket's shrine at Canterbury as a producer of miracles, to the apocryphal tale of Henry VIII disi nterring Becket's remains and putting them on trial for treason, before spreading them to the winds and wat ers of reliquary oblivion. Even two years ago a new book appeared reinvestigating long lost legends as to the continued existence, somewhere in Canterbury Cathedral, of the bones of Thomas Becket . For advocates of the English monarchy and effective centralised administration of justice, the stiff necked resistance of the Archbishop was treachery. For the religious, the same resistance represents the triumph of the spiritual over the temporal and martyrdom for the church. For the anxieties of a world after the pointless sacrifices of the Great W ar, T.S. Eliott found an ideal statement of the strength of spiritual belief in his play \" Murder in the Cathedral \" expressed in poetic form, save for the speeches of the assassins which are in prose. For J ean Anouilh, writing his play \" Becket\" in Nazi occupied France, there was the theme of resistance to foreign invasion based on the historically inaccurate description of Thomas, in a French biogr aphy, as a Saxon resisting the Norman King. In fact Becket was a Norman. My own attraction to the close study of this period is based on a personal belief that if you try to r ead everything, you will learn nothing. Accordingly, it is preferable to organise ones ignorance by investigating a particular subject matter in depth. Like others who have returned to the sources of th is Homeric struggle between Archbishop and King, I too have been attracted by the thought that in history one can learn lessons for our own time. One returns to the first centuries of the second mi llennium of the Christian era, a millennium which commenced on the 1st January, 1001. Those who propo se to celebrate the end of the century and millennium on the 31st December of this year are, o f course, proclaiming the twentieth to be the first century that consisted of only ninety-nine years. A t the time of the creation of the anno domini system, by the sixth century monk, Dionysius Exiguus - a ro ugh translation of his name is \"Dennis the Short\" - the Arab mathematician who invented the zero had no t been born, indeed would not be for several centuries. Accordingly 1 BC was immediately succeed ed by 1AD and each century ended on the 31st December of the year ending with double zero. So it was that when Australia became a federation o n 1 January 1901 the slogan of the time was 'A New Nation for a New Century'. What has happened in this century is that people have got used to the odometer turning over in motor vehicles where one n otices 999 becoming 1,000. We have come to attribute a new kind of populist significance to th e double zero. I expect that on 31 December 2000 there will be a m ore muted celebration of the true new millennium, by a significant number of religious fanatics and a few pedants like me. In the first centuries of this second millennium, t he basic fault line of political life in western Christendom was constituted by the conflicting inst itutional imperatives of the Church on the one hand and secular rulers on the other. This has some simi larities to the fault line of politics over approximately the last two centuries, which has bee n the conflicting institutional imperatives of the centralised state on the one hand and private organ isations of various kinds, particularly commercial corporations on the other. In both of these periods , the pursuit of institutional self-interest was a Print Page Close Window Page 1 of 11 Becket and Henry II: Select Ruminations rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_27 ... mainspring of social action. Institutional loyalty was a primary social bond. It was so during medieva l times and has become so again. Institutions like individuals have a craving for se lf esteem. The personal imperative for prestige, recognition and freedom amongst individuals is refl ected in institutional demands for autonomy. A preoccupation with institutional loyalties is prese nt in all ages, but in some periods of history it p roves to be more central to the issues of the time than i n others. The salience of institutional loyalty is something which our own times share with the twelft h century. Loyalty was the centrepiece of the medieval moral f ramework. Loyalty which overrides all standards of ethical conduct. Loyalty which drove four knights t o murder an Archbishop in his cathedral. This was just the kind of behaviour that aristocrats demande d and admired - indeed still demand and admire - from their underlings. They call in honour. On the other hand there was a loyalty of similar force bas ed on the power of ideas and faith. Specifically, in t he context with which I am dealing, the sense of loyalty demanded by an organised Church and by the institutionalised component parts of that Church. My approach to these issues is that of a secular hi storian. For those who regard this as inappropriate when dealing with the life of a martyr and Saint, I apologise in advance.. It is the only perspective which I am capable of bringing to the events. Any student of medieval society knows the significa nce attached to the institutional independence of the corporate groups in which that society was divi ded. A keyword of the contemporary rhetoric was \"libertas\" identifying the special rights and privi leges of particular institutions. In a sense the Ch urch and the various manifestations of secular authority were each claiming autonomy on their own part. The claim of institutional autonomy by the monarchy and by the Church, is the central theme of the conflict between Becket and Henry. Over a period of two decades in the middle of the t welfth century a civil war had convulsed England, primarily because of the refusal by a group of baro ns to accept a woman as monarch. Matilda the daughter of Henry I and grand-daughter of William t he Conqueror - so referred to by English historians but still, universally, referred to by French histo rians with affection as 'William the Bastard' - had been deprived of her inheritance by the House of Blois, which put King Stephen on the throne. Matilda abdicated her claim in favour of her son, Henry, pr oduct of her union with Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. Count Geoffrey had ruthlessly subjugated Normandy, on behalf of his wife's claim to succeed her father. After the death of his own son and heir, Stephen si gned a formal treaty adopting Henry on terms that he would succeed as King of England on Stephen's de ath, which occurred within a year. This marked a most extraordinary transition for Henry. The 17 y ear old Henry became Duke of Normandy on his father's nomination in 1150, Count of Anjou on his father's death in 1151, Duke of Aquitane in 1152, by marriage within two months of the day on which E leanor of Aquitane had, for failure to produce a male heir, been divorced by the King of France, and finally, King of England on Stephen's death in 1154: Henry was 21 years of age. As part of the peace settlement between Stephen and Henry it had been agreed that all castles which had been erected since the death of Henry I should be destroyed. The reference to the state of affairs at the time of Henry I appears in the young Henry's actions for the first time. This was to be a centr al feature of his political rhetoric and programme for his reign. The basis of his legitimacy, and his political strength against the power which the usur per Stephen had obtained from incumbency, was Henry's assertion of a direct and immediate success ion to Henry I. Throughout his reign he continued to assert that the period of usurpation did not cre ate rights enforceable by the barons against him. Nor, though he did not yet articulate it, would he accept the substantial expansion of what the Church perceived to be the rights it had acquired during t hose years. His rhetoric of restoration was repeate d in countless charters, writs and letters as a hallm ark, almost, of political obsession. In the case of the castles described as \"adulterine \", because they had not been legitimately licensed by Henry I, Henry was concerned with the practicali ties of his future authority. Castles were the basi c building blocks of secular authority. Such structur es, of varying sophistication, enabled barons to assert independence from the King. A castle enable the castellan to control the surrounding countryside. Henry's first task as King was to ensure the full i mplementation of the treaty by which the barons had Page 2 of 11 Becket and Henry II: Select Ruminations NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_27 ... bound themselves to destroy or hand over castles. H e did so much earlier than any of them could have expected. Even then, there would be 225 legiti mate baronial castles against 49 of his own. A ratio of 5:1. Methodically, by continual expansion and improvement of Royal castles and by taking advantage of each domestic accident to remove or re duce the fortifications of the Barons, he and his sons were to reduce that ratio to about 2:1. This perhaps more than anything else was the founda tion of the expansion off Royal justice in England. It is in many ways the definitive measure of Henry's contribution to the development of the legal system. His first act as King was to identify precise time limits for the destruction of the rem aining strongholds. He marched north to invest and attack castellans, some of whom had earlier been his allies. He obtained formal recognition that all for tifications were either his property or required hi s permission, in return for definite feudal services. Henry II was a passionate man with boundless aggres sive energy. He had one overriding passion and that was to control everything around him. His ener gy was single mindedly channelled into the exercise of power. A King could do and say what he wanted, when he wan ted. That was the ultimate freedom. He alone had it and he wanted everyone to know that he alone had it. Henry never tried to hide his incessant infidelities. He frequently abandoned both in publi c and private, any semblance of self-control, as hi s volatile temper flashed from an affable gentleness into an ungovernable blind rage terrifying all arou nd him with blasphemous epithets. Whatever the context , whether trivial or profound, Henry wanted - needed - to be in complete control. This frequently led to carpet chewing rages of infantile self- indulgence. As the generally admiring courtier Walter Map noted , when listing what he thought were Henry's few defects, Henry was \"Impatient of repose, he did not scruple to disturb half of Christendom.\" As one hostile, but grudgingly admiring eye-witness , known to historians as Gerald of Wales, recalled: \"He allowed himself neither tranquillity nor repose . He was addicted to the chase beyond measure; at crack of dawn he was off on horseback, traversing waste lands, penetrating forests and climbing the mountain tops and so he pa ssed restless days. At evening on his return home he was rarely seen to sit down eith er before or after supper. After such great wearisome exertions he would wear out the who le court by continually standing.\" This stocky, barrel chested, bandy legged King cont inually paraded his considerable physical energy by making everyone keep up with his horsemanship an d exploiting the etiquette which prevented anyone sitting unless he sat. The social framework of the Middle Ages was constit uted by a hierarchy of interconnected loyalties created by mutual oaths. Henry sought to create an identity between legitimate authority as stipulated in this framework and the realities of power exerci sed by physical coercion. Future historians would seek to portray his conduct as representing the int erests of the people and of stable government. That was not his intention. He identified his person wit h the institution of the monarchy and the ultimate virtue was his own independence and authority. His autonomy was an end in itself, not some instrument for achieving the peace and welfare of o thers. Henry II was one of the great legal innovators of a ll time. To understand how Henry's drive for power led to a transformation of the legal system, it is necessary to understand how medieval society was pervaded by a system of rules, not market exchanges . Indeed, its detailed regulation is replicated in the worst bureaucratic nightmares of our own centur y. This was a rule bound society down to the very lowe st level. In the manors which were the basic farming units, the manorial courts created rules of considerable detail: for example, specifying the s ize of the loaves of bread which working villeins would receive for lunch or of the sheaves of corn which they would receive at the end of a working day; the amount of the fee payable if a villein's daughter wanted to marry and of the fine if she were found t o be unchaste; the right of a free meal for servant s on the day of the lord's marriage; the gifts that h ad to be paid to the lord on stipulated religious f east days; the number of days a tenant was obliged to wo rk on the lord's land; how many days he had to mow and carry hay; the area of land he had to ploug h, sow and harrow and whether or not he had to supply a plough and oxen; the precise amount of cor n he must pay for the privilege of using the lord's monopoly over grinding and baking at his nominated mill and bakery; how many times he may have to move the sheep a year and how many days he must spe nd in washing and shearing sheep. One is Page 3 of 11 Becket and Henry II: Select Ruminations NSW 23/03/2012 reminded of the detailed specifying entitle ments in the contemporary welfare state. Henry's power and authority as Count, Duke and King - and the wealth which brought him military strength - depended on an intricate web of overlapp ing powers, rights, and privileges and prerogatives. In England, the basic theoretical ass umption was that the King owned all the land. He in fact kept direct control of a considerable proporti on of England particularly in the area known as \"forests\", in which a separate, almost totalitarian , legal regime was in force, protecting his extensi ve property interests in farms and herds of animals as a royal larder, as well as the favourite royal spo rt of hunting. In addition to the services, and fees in lieu of se rvices which the king was entitled to receive from his tenants in chief for the land he permitted them to occupy, the king had a range of rights which entitl ed him to the profits of land during vacancies - such as before the confirmation of a successor or during the wardship of a minor. This extended to the prope rties held by the senior ecclesiastics, including t he Archbishop of Canterbury. This gave him, of course, a vested interest to delay as long as possible the appointment of any successor to an office particula rly, as under the reform papacy, Archbishops and bishops unlike secular barons, were not themselves entitled to pay key money to hasten an appointment. In addition the King had a right to consent to cert ain acts - for which a fee, generally called a \"rel ief\" could be charged. This included the confirmation of heirs to a deceased estate; the marriage of a widow or single heiress or of a ward. Furthermore t here were the profits of justice - yes they were profits in those days - including fines, forfeiture of the estates of convicted criminals, fees of ela stic size for providing a forum at all, and for \"amercem ents\" - i.e. payment for the King's mercy - perhaps for failing to perform some public duty like appreh ending a criminal, at other times for a breach of a private duty, like taking a wife without permission but often, for merely displeasing the king. Every year a flow of payments were recorded in the Treasury fo r matters such as this: \"for having the King's benevolence\" or his \"love\" or his avour\" or that \"the King's \"abate\" or be \"put aside\". Henry's fits of temper w ere a major royal profit centre. At every point in the feudal system, there was a de tailed list of services and obligations - many of which were commuted for cash payments. These were n ot only at the level of the monarchy. They were reflected right down through the feudal hierar chy. A bewildering variety of services in addition to or in lieu of a stipulated annual rent were attache d to particular grants of land or leases; to feed t he animals near the King's hunting lodge at Woodstock; to keep a certain number of falconers during the mewing and moulting season and deliver them to the King when ready to fly; to provide the King with a meal of roast pork when he hunted in a nearby for est; to supply a new tablecloth worth three shillings at Michaelmas; to supply a pair of scisso rs at Christmas; to rear one puppy a year for the King; to carry the King's banner when he visited th e area. Nothing was too detailed for specification. Upon the solemn royal crown wearing of Christmas da y, Rolland, the tenant of Hemingstone in Suffolk, was required to attend at court and perfor m - as the rhythmical Latin of his formal deed of t itle recorded - \"Unum saltum et siffletum et unum bumbul um\" namely he was obliged to make 'a leap, a whistle and a fart'. The complexity and detail of these arrangements - m ost of which have implications for the King's revenue - makes even the Income Tax Assessment Act look simple. To maximise the value of all of these various rights and prerogatives required an a cute legal mind. This was Henry's greatest strength. As one of his contemporaries said, Henry was a \"subtle devisor of legal processes\". This is an under-statement. The writs that he issued are th e foundations of a centralised system of royal justice of which we are the beneficiaries to this d ay. In such a rule bound society Henry's preoccupation with legal detail was the essential foundation of his success. His acute sense of his own position tr ansformed his sense of personal honour into an almost oriental concern with \"face\". Perhaps more a ppropriately - given the Norman heritage of Sicily and southern Italy - a mafia like preoccupation wit h \"respect\". Henry was never more generous than when others gave him complete face or respect or honour in acknowledgment that he was not beholden to any othe r person. He reserved his greatest wrath for anyone who seemed to question his authority in any way. This was the case during the conflict with Becket. Becket's advancement in the world came about under the personal patronage of Theobald, his predecessor as Archbishop of Canterbury. Theobald w as born in the Norman town of Thiereville, where Thomas Becket 's father was also born. Theobald had spent the enti rety of his adult life in the Page 4 of 11 Becket and Henry II: Select Ruminations NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_27 ... piety of the Abbey of Bec, four miles from Thierevi lle. That Abbey, deliberately located in difficult terrain in the Risle valley of Normandy, had attrac ted as its first prior one of the most cultivated ecclesiastical lawyers of the time, the Italian Lan franc. The school he established at the Abbey rapid ly acquired a reputation throughout Europe attracting patronage as well as numerous monks. The Abbey prospered with its Norman sponsors. Lanfr anc became Archbishop of Canterbury after 1066. The most powerful figure in England after Wil liam the Conqueror himself. The second Abbot of Bec, St Anselm, the dominant theologian of the age, indeed one of the greatest of all time, became Lanfranc's successor as Archbishop. Becket joined the personal staff of Theobald as a s trapping young man in his early twenties with some education and with experience - unusual for a cleri c - in the world of commerce. His particular skills , and quite probably his attractiveness to Theobald, lay in his administrative and financial experience. Becket had been employed as a clerk by a London mer chant who relished in the name, Osbert Huit- Deniers or \"Eightpence\", in what is recognisable as a rudimentary kind of bank. Becket's background in practical affairs is referre d to by all his biographers, but not even the most devoted of his biographers attempt to portray him a s having an interest in matters of theology or any other form of intellectual activity. Plainly he was intelligent, quick witted and had an extraordinary memory, this is the unanimous opinion of his biogra phers. However, he was never interested in ideas. His basic education was at Merton Priory, south of London near contemporary Wimbledon. This was followed by study in Paris at its nascent universit y and, later, Theobald sent him to the law school a t Bologna. He was in Paris at the time of Abelard - a n outstanding mind and an early example of the Parisian tendency to treat intellectuals as stars. He went to Bologna at the time of Gratian - one of the greatest legal scholars of all time. There is no re cord that Becket sought out either Abelard or Grati an or was interested in anything they had to offer. Be cket's time in Paris, according to his biographers, was spent in boisterous undergraduate dissipation, including participation in the aristocratic blood sports of hawking and hunting. Within the Archbishop's household, Becket attracted the particular patronage of Theobald's brother, Walter, probably because he worked directly with hi m in administering the Archbishop's estates. No biographer suggests that Becket made any contributi on to the Archbishop's spiritual, educational or charitable functions. Walter held the office of Archdeacon of Canterbury, the superintendent of the hierarchy of rural deans and parish clergy throughout the diocese. For purpo ses of administration, the archdeacon was the Archbishop's deputy and alter ego, administering th e estates and collecting the fees. The archdeaconry, as a formal office, had is own synod and court for resolving disputes. There were rules of custom as to the proportion of synodal dues or c hrism fees or profits of the ordeal which an archdeacon could keep and the proportion he had to pass on to his bishop or archbishop. The income of the Archdeacon of Canterbury was estimated to be 100 pounds a year, which made him a very rich man indeed. Becket's intelligence and organisational skills mar ked him for promotion. Theobald took him to witness the workings of the Church at its highest level at the Council of Rheims in 1148. This was an importan t experience which requires a separate paper. In 1151 Theobald entrusted to Becket the sensitive task of a mission to Rome to forestall the anticipatory coronation by Stephen of his son Eustace as King of England. Notwithstanding what appears to be defects of his e arly education including imperfections in his Latin , unfamiliarity with the intellectual intricacies of theology and his need for catch-up schooling in law , Becket proved a skilled negotiator. His intelligenc e, wit, eloquence - notwithstanding an engaging slight stammer - personal vivacity and ingratiating manner is attested by all his contemporary biographers. His bearing - handsome, unusually tall , with even features and a slightly aquiline nose - combined with these personal characteristics to mak e him a pleasant companion, so desirable a quality in a diplomat or a courtier. Eventually Becket was himself appointed Archdeacon of Canterbury. The position of archdeacon was no role for a sensitive theologian or of a monk pre occupied with salvation. Archdeacons were generally regarded as worldly and mercenary. Theolo gians of the era debated the ironic question \"Is it possible for an Archdeacon to be saved?\" One anxiou s cleric refused appointment as Archdeacon because he feared the temptation of accepting an of fice with a vested financial interest in the Page 5 of 11 Becket and Henry II: Select Ruminations rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_27 ... multiplication of sin. Henry II would later voice t he common opinion when he complained to Theobald that the archdeacons of England extorted more from the people than he himself could collect in taxes. Later when an avaricious cleric used Becket as an e xample to justify taking money from sinners for the computation of penance, the exasperated Bishop declared, \"Believe me, it was not that which made him a Saint!\" It is no accident that his conte mporary biographers do not dwell on Becket's role as archdeacon. Combining administrative and judicial functions, th e archdeacon represented the Bishop in numerous delegated functions: holding courts and synods, goi ng on visitations, searching out married clergy, collecting fines, fees and tithes. Sometimes this w as done like tax farming in the manner of the rural office of sheriff - namely paying a fixed annual am ount to the bishop or archbishop and keeping anything that could be collected over and above tha t. Today, this old tradition of tax farming would b e called \"privatisation\". Theobald had formally consecrated Becket as a deaco n prior to his appointment to the archdeaconry. He was then prohibited - as he had not been as a me re tonsured clerk - from pursuing activities inconsistent with that status, such as marrying or bearing arms. However he had still not heard a call for a vocation as a priest. That call, with its add itional restraints, would not come until the time o f his appointment as archbishop. Becket was a practical man of the world with real k nowledge of administrative requirements. Immediately upon the coronation of Henry II, Theoba ld urged the new king to appoint Becket as his Chancellor. That occurred. Becket did not however s urrender the other appointments he held at Canterbury including the archdeaconry and a number of other specific appointments together with the profits they brought him. There can be no doubt that Becket's appointment was in part due to the new king's need for the Church's goodwill, particularly that of Theobald, a t a time when his authority in his new kingdom had yet to be established on a firm footing. He was abo ut to launch his attack on the adulterine castles. The appointment was a triumph. A close personal bond was quickly created between H enry and his Chancellor. In his play, Becket, Jean Anouilh captured the easy, almost fraternal, a mity between them, to which all the contemporary biographers testify, as follows: \"Becket: I received two forks --- King: Forks? - Becket: Yes it's a new instrument a devilish little thing to look at - and to use too. It's for ronging meat and carrying it to your mouth. It save s you dirtying your fingers - King: But then you dirty the fork? So are your fing ers. I don't see the point. Becket: It hasn't any practically speaking. But it' s refined, it's subtle it very un-Norman. King: You must order me a dozen! I want to see my g reat fat barons' faces at the first court banquet when I present them with that. We won't tell them w hat they are for. They won't make head nor tail of them! I bet they'll think they are a new kind of da gger.\" Becket emerges as the King's closest confidante and friend at court, not merely an adviser but a daily companion. They shared a mutual passion for hunting and hawking. Henry was fluent in a number of languages including Latin and, even more unusually for an aristocrat of that time, was even known to read books. The King and his Chancellor even enjoye d what was then regarded as the somewhat raffish game of chess, when the moves of bishops, k nights and castles had layers of meaning long since lost and in the words of a contemporary chron icler: \"Where front to front the mimic warriors close, to check the progress of their mimic foes.\" The relationship was not such as to prevent Henry, on numerous occasions making sure that everyone knew who was boss, including his closest a ssociate Becket. Page 6 of 11 Becket and Henry II: NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_27 ... Later, after the breakdown of their relationship at the moment of a formal reconciliation, Henry's spontaneous outburst revealed his greatest hurt. Ac cording to the chroniclers he said: \"Oh, if you would only do what I wish.\" It was almost a cry of pain. As long as he was Chancellor, Becket did precisely what Henry wished. Becket understood from the closeness of their relationship and by witnessing a myriad of examples of Henry's preoccupation with his own authority, that it would be suicidal to cha llenge Henry in any way which questioned his abilit y to freely exercise his will or pursue his own inter ests as he saw them. When he did so as archbishop, he knew what to expect. In the time available to me this evening, it is onl y possible to give one example. One of the first ta sks Becket had to perform as Chancellor involved a conf lict of interests between the King and the Church, including Archbishop Theobald. This concerned a jur isdictional conflict over Battle Abbey. For his victory at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 a nd in penance for the slaughter, William the Conqueror established an abbey and ordered that the altar stone be laid at the very spot that Harold fell. Battle Abbey was a sacred site in both a secu lar and theological sense. It was the Norman cenotaph. By reason of its unique status as a Royal chapel - like Westminster Abbey - it laid claim to unique privileges, particularly in the form of exemption f rom control of the local bishop, the Bishop of Chichester. Its claim was based on the circumstance s of its creation. It asserted that William as its founder had expressly preserved its independence fr om episcopal control. Whether or not a secular ruler could, even by means of a foundation grant for the creation of a religious institution, alter hierarchical relations hips within the Church, engaged one of the most important political issues of the time. This is som etimes described as a conflict between Church and State: somewhat anachronistically because the word State does not accurately describe the network of interconnecting mutual rights and obligations up on which secular authority was based. Nevertheless the terminology is convenient. The claim that such exemption could be given by a l ay ruler was entirely inconsistent with the agenda of the reform papacy of the eleventh and twelfth ce nturies. There were practical matters involved as well as th e principle of autonomy. If the abbey were subject to supervision by the archbishop then it had to att end his court and synod, paying the synodal fees. I t also had to provide hospitality to the archbishop a nd his entourage wherever he paid a visit. In the context of the hiatus in secular authority d uring the reign of Stephen, Hilary, the Bishop of Chichester asserted his authority over Battle Abbey . He excommunicated the Abbot for failure to obey his orders. The Abbot of that time was a Norman of impeccable h eritage. Walter de Luci was the brother of Richard de Luci, a knight who had acquired signific ant estates in the service of Stephen. Under the truce between Stephen and Henry, Richard was the cu stodian of the key castles at Windsor and the Tower of London, to ensure the succession of Henry. At the time of the truce Archbishop Theobald, had to direct Hilary to lift the sentence of excomm unication so that Walter, together with all the oth er Normans who owed an oath of fealty directly to the king for the lands which they held of the king, could renew their oaths in person before Henry and ensure the succession that had been agreed. The detailed house history kept by the monks of the Abbey, known as the \"Battle Chronicle\", described Walter as \"standing manfully firm to pres erve unharmed the treasures of the Church, its lands, liberties and royal customs\". Walter relied on a formal charter which purported to be issued by William, together with confirmatory charters in the names of his successors, William Rufus and Henry I. Notwithstanding the assertion of their veracity in the Battle Chronicle, it is quite likely that th e charters were forgeries. They had first emerged at a conference in the Royal Chapel of the White Tower in London attended by King Stephen and a grou p of loyal Barons and ecclesiastics. No-one had apparently heard of them until then. Not even t he Battle Chronicle suggests that they had. Their existence is probably inconsistent with the profess ion of obedience which Walter de Luci himself had made to the Bishop of Chichester upon his appointme nt to Battle Abbey. These charters were probably concocted in an active copying centre at Westminster Abbey which, Page 7 of 11 Becket and Henry II: Select Ruminations rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_27 ... having made its own matrices of the seals of Edward the Confessor and William I had provided a stream of writs and charters for abbeys at Coventry , Gloucester, Ramsay, Bury, St Peters of Ghent as well, of course, for itself. Forgery was a well established tradition of the era . Monasteries were notorious throughout Europe for practising forgery when it suited them. No doubt it was believed that these documents merely provided documentation for an actual event which had, or sho uld have, occurred but for some reason was negligently conveyed only in oral form or, even wor se, had been left to implication. When arranging a forgery to establish what was no d oubt a genuinely held oral tradition of their exceptional status, the monks of Battle Abbey stood in a well established tradition. Their in-house history, the Battle Chronicle, proclaimed: \"Christ did not suffer His Church to be bereft of i ts ancient and just privileges, but at an appropria te time, by His watchfulness he renewed them stronger than ever before.\" To say the least this is an odd way to describe a j urisdictional conflict between a group of monks on the one hand and an archbishop and bishop on the ot her. Shortly after the coronation of Henry II, Abbot Wal ter forwarded the charters to the new King and sought their confirmation by a fresh charter. Henry was not then in a position to act. His authority w as not entirely secure after so many years of civil wa r. He was not prepared to offend the Church. The Norman nobility undoubtedly supported the Abbey not least in the persona of Richard de Luci, Stephens former right hand man, appropriately calle d \"The Loyal One\", whom Henry had just appointed co-justiciar of England, the Crown's most senior administrative post. The critical task for Henry was to confirm his actual authority over the group of regional war lords who had consolidated contiguous areas of territory over which they ruled . The adulterine castles had yet to be suppressed. The claims of the Bishop of Chichester were support ed by the official hierarchy of the Church and, in particular, by Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury. T he ideology of the reform papacy rejected such lay interference in the internal affairs of the Chu rch. Furthermore, the Archbishop of Canterbury had a direct interest in ensuring the claims of his own B ishop, who reported to him. Finally, Theobald himse lf was engaged in a longstanding conflict of a similar character with the monks of St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury itself. When the issue of Battle Abbe y arose, that conflict had not been resolved. England was unusual in that some English cathedrals were manned by monks, clergy called \"regular\" because they lived by a \"rule\". Christ Church in Ca nterbury, which was attached to the Cathedral made it one of those cathedrals. A longstanding con flict existed with the neighbouring monastery of St Augustine's, located just outside the Canterbury ci ty walls. It was of course St Augustine who, as a monk leading a band of monks, had executed the miss ion to convert the heathens of what became known as England. The celebrity of St Augustine's was based on its re lics. St Augustine's body, entombed within the Abbey, was, at that stage, of infinitely greater si gnificance to pilgrims and others than anything whi ch Christ Church or the Cathedral could offer. Other Abbeys had local patron Saints, such as the S anto in Padua, St Zeno in Verona and St Appolinaire in Ravenna - this was St Appolinaire in Classe not St Appolinaire Nuova, the former being determined, in a bitter arbitration, by Pope Alexan der III to be the true resting place of St Appolina rus. These abbeys were regarded as more sacred edifices than the cathedrals in their city, and many still are. St Augustine's would remain such, until comple tely overshadowed by the shrine of St Thomas at Christ Church. The early Archbishops of Canterbury, many of whom b ecame saints, were buried in St Augustine's rather than the Cathedral - until the ninth Archbis hop, Cuthbert, having negotiated the secret permission of the Pope and the King of Kent, direct ed his remains to be interred in his own Cathedral and that his death be kept a secret until after his burial. Foiled by what they regarded as a conspira cy, on the death of the next Archbishop, the Abbot of S t Augustines tried to storm the Cathedral at the head of an armed mob but was repulsed. Throughout Europe there were abbeys which had acqui red institutional freedom from the supervision of the Bishop, by asserting a direct, unintermediat ed subjection to the Pope himself. This was a Page 8 of 11 Becket and Henry II: Select Ruminations rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_27 ... privilege which successive Popes were not reluctant to grant. St Augustines sought to acquire such independence f or itself. After all, its Abbot ranked second only to the Abbot of Monte Casino in the Benedictine ord er. Theobald became involved in a long legal battle whe n he attempted to enforce the annual dues which, according to Canterbury tradition, were owing by th e Abbey to the Archbishop.: two pounds ten shillings and seven pence in cash; two rams; 30 sma ll loaves; two and four units of mead and one of beer. This aspect of the conflict was settled when the monks assigned substantial property to the Archbishop to remove this annual reminder of their bondage. During Stephen's rule, various aspects of St August ine,s had been conducted in defiance of Archbishop Theobald's instructions. He excommunicat ed the second and third ranking officers in the hierarchy, the prior Sylvester and the sacristan. T heobald won this case in Rome. Sylvester and the other defaulting officers had to publicly confess t heir sins and endure a period of humiliation and penance. However, when Sylvester became Abbot, he r efused to swear, as all of his predecessors had done, \"Canonical obedience in all things\" to Th eobald and his successors. It took Theobald six years and numerous appeals to the Pope, before he o btained an order that Sylvester make the traditional promise. This issue had not been resolv ed when the jurisdictional conflict over Battle Abb ey erupted. Theobald shared the belief of the Bishop o f Chichester of the importance of maintaining the hierarchy of the Church. When Walter de Luci first raised the alleged charte rs with Henry II, Archbishop Theobald appealed to the King not to confirm the charters by reissuing t hem. He said, according to the Battle Chronicle: \"The King ought not to allow the Church of Canterbu ry, the mother of all England and the authority by which the King himself had been crowne d and the church of Chichester, its suffragan, to be despoiled of liberties and privile ges held from ancient times, merely for Battle, a church of no such authority or rank.\" This was a direct challenge to the great significan ce the Norman nobility attached to the Abbey. There can be little doubt that Henry made it clear to the de Luci brothers that as soon as he felt able to s tand up to the Church, the Abbey would have its charter. Within days of the formal submission by the last re calcitrant northern baron on 7 July 1155, at a full assembly of Bishops and Barons at the site of the s iege, Henry gave Walter de Luci his charter. Henry of Chichester had not given up. He approached the Pope who summonsed Walter de Luci to come to the episcopal centre at Chichester to recei ve orders from the Pope himself. Walter replied with a series of qualifications unknown to the cano n law: \"He would obey in all respects, saving the honour o f the Lord Pope, his fealty and honour of his own Lord King, his own person and his order and sav ing the rights of his Church.\" The phrase \"saving his order\" was a phrase which Be cket would himself use to Henry and which would trigger the crisis between himself as Archbis hop and the King. Walter de Luci's qualifications were particularly fulsome. They were those of a man who was confident of his supporters. Henry decided to put an end to the dispute once and for all. He called a full council of archbishops, bishops, earls and barons for May 1157. A few days before the formal council was due to commence in Colchester Abbey, Henry summoned a group of Batt le Abbey supporters to a secret preparatory meeting: the Abbot, his brother Richard de Luci, Be cket and a few close confidants. At this meeting, Becket took the King through the various charters, including a new version of William's original chart er which had just been \"discovered\". It bore the \"sign ature\" of the Bishop of Chichester of the day. At a n earlier time Hilary had pointed out the absence of any such acknowledgment by any of his own predecessors in the copies of the charters shown to him. That problem had been overcome. One of the issues to be discussed was the fact that upon his succession as Abbot, Walter de Luci had made a formal profession of obedience to the Bishop of Chichester. According to the Battle Chronicle, a biased but, as far as one can tell, not inaccurat e source, Henry responded: Page 9 of 11 Becket and Henry II: Select rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_27 ... 'Profession is not against the privileges of Church es. For those who make profession do not promise anything beyond what they ought.\" A flexible doctrine indeed designed, as so many of Henry's positions were designed, to maximise his own flexibility in all circumstances. He of course had to make such professions to the King of France as a Count and a Duke. During the course of this pr eliminary meeting, Richard de Luci forcefully put the Norman case: \"This Church should be elevated to the highest rank by you and by all us Normans. For there the most noble King William by God's grace and with the aid of our kin, won that by which you hold the Crown of England at this very moment in he reditary right and by which we have all been enriched with great wealth. We therefore pray your clemency to protect this Church and its privileges and exemptions with the hand of your authority and to command that it, with all its possessions, be free.\" Henry made it quite clear that he had made up his m ind to do just that. When the formal trial convened at Colchester Abbey a few days later, Hilary and his key supporters, like Archbishop Theobald, were taken by surprise by the determination of the King. Hilary chose to give the King a lecture on the ideo logy of the reform papacy. According to the Battle Chronicle, he said: \"Jesus Christ our Lord has established two abodes a nd two powers for the governments of this world: One is the spiritual the other the material. The spiritual is that to which our Lord Jesus Christ referred when He said to our first shepherd the Apostle Peter and through him, to all his disciples and successors, 'You are Peter and upon t his rock shall I build my Church'. As a result the Church of Rome, marked out by the aposto late of the Prince of the Apostles has achieved so great and so marvellous a pre-eminence world wide that no Bishop, no ecclesiastical person at all may be deposed from hi s ecclesiastical seat without its judgment and permission.\" Hilary invoked the doctrine by which each Bishop co uld trace his authority by a direct line of succession back to the sacred powers conferred by C hrist on each of his twelve Apostles. This is the most successful direct lineage of institutional leg itimacy that the world has ever known, with the possible exception of the Chinese imperial traditio n. Henry reacted with his usual undisciplined anger to the suggestion that his authority was in any way limited. In response to Hilary's assertion that no ecclesiastical person may be deposed from his ecclesiastical seat, Henry said, \"Very true a Bisho p may not be deposed\". However, gesturing with his hands he added, \"But see, with a good push he could be ejected\". Ignoring what the Battle Chronicle describes as \"un iversal laughter\" Hilary pressed on: \"It is impossible for any layman, indeed even a Kin g to give ecclesiastical privileges and exemptions to Churches and ecclesiastical authority shows that it is impossible for those arrogated to them by laymen to be valid except by t he permission and confirmation of the Holy Father by the laws of Rome.\" Henry responded in fury: \"You are plotting to attack the royal prerogative g iven to me by god with your crafty arguments. I command that you undergo just legal judgment for presumptuous words against my crown and royal prerogative.\" Becket assumed something of the role of a counsel a ssisting the Court. He reminded Hilary of the Page 10 of 11 Becket and Henry II: Select Ruminations rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_27 ... oath of fealty he had taken to the King and said, \" You should therefore be prudent\", by way of warning. Then Walter de Luci played his trump card. He prese nted the new copy of William's charter which purported to be sealed by Hilary's predecessor as B ishop of Chichester. Hilary pointed out that he had never seen or even heard of the charter in the year s of disputation. Becket was called upon to reply to Hilary. He descr ibed Battle Abbey as \"The King's own chapel\" and proceeded on the assumption that the charters were genuine. At this point a crucial moment in the trial occurre d. As I have mentioned the Pope himself had issued a direction to the Abbot to present himself at Chiche ster and accept the authority of the Bishop. Appeal s from any part of the English Church to the Pope, wh ich occurred without the King's consent, were plainly regarded as a fundamental challenge to the monarch's authority. Indeed in the previous year in the context of the claim for exemption by St August ines, Pope Adrian, the only English Pope, had accused Archbishop Theobald of conspiring with Henr y to \"bury appeals to Rome\". Becket directly challenged Hilary on this question of the appeal to Rome and the way in which the papal order had been implemented by officers of the Archbishop when they refused the request for a delay by the Abbot of Battle. Becket is recorded as saying: \"Your clerks kept demanding from him things that we re against the royal prerogative. The Abbot prayed that they give him a delay so that he might go to our lord King and hear his advice and his wishes in the matter. They refused a nd he was unable to get his delay.\" At this point, Henry, menacingly demanded to know w hether Hilary had procured the papal letter. Perhaps realising the debate was over, Hilary denie d it, on oath - to everyone's astonishment. Theobald, according to a malicious aside by the chr onicler of Battle, crossed himself. The king's determination was plain. Theobald made o ne last effort to obtain a face saving formula which acknowledged the independence of the Church. He asked the king: \"May Your Excellency command us to reconsider what should be done about this and settle it by the judicial method of Church custom.\" Henry replied emphatically: \"No. I shall not command it to be settled that way by you. I shall put a proper finish to it in your company and having taken counsel about it.\" After lengthy discussions, Hilary capitulated. He r enounced his claim which meant there could be no appeal to Rome from this decision. Archbishop Theob ald ratified the agreement both as archbishop and papal legate. Henry made it quite clear that he was prepared to e xercise his authority over the English Church and would not tolerate claims to independence based on the superior status of the papacy. He was determined to restrict the Pope's claim to exercise a legal jurisdiction within his kingdom. The principles of the independence of the Church en shrined in the canon law were regarded by Henry as an affront to his own status. When, in the years to come, Becket sought to draw on those principles, he knew that this was not a matter on w hich Henry was likely to compromise.

Access to Justice and Human Rights Treaties KEYNOTE ADDRESS BY THE HONOURABLE J J SPIGELMAN CHI EF JUSTICE OF NEW SOUTH WALES TO THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE AUSTRALIAN PLAINTIFF LAWYERS ASSOCIATION 22 OCTOBER 1999 Access to Justice and Human Rights Treaties Paget-Lewis, a school teacher at Ahmed Osman's scho ol in England developed a sexual infatuation with his student. Over a period of months he subjec ted Ahmed and his family to a process of stalking and harassment all of which was reported to the pol ice. When interviewed by the police, Paget-Lewis admitted that he was in danger of doing something c riminally insane. To a school inspector, who reported the matter to police, he made clear threat s to murder Ahmed's family. Police officers were instructed to arrest him, but nothing occurred for three months. On 7 March 1988 he followed the Osman family home where he shot and injured Ahmed O sman and killed his father. Ahmed and his mother instituted proceedings for neg ligence against the police for failing to prevent the attempted murder of Ahmed and the murder of his father. The statement of claim was struck out. An appeal to the Court of Appeal was unsuccessful. The Court applied the House of Lords decision in the Yorkshire Ripper case, Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police 1 , in which the House of Lords had decided that, for public policy reasons, no action would lie against the police for negligen ce in the investigation and suppression of crime. In Osman 2 the court rejected the submission that the House of Lords' decision in Hill was concerned with police policy decisions, which were immune, bu t did not extend to police operational decisions. A number of other arguments designed to distinguish Hill were rejected. There were important issues of public policy involved in this line of authority an d the British courts had determined where that poli cy lay. As Lord Templeman said in Hill: \"... If this action lies, every citizen will be able to require the court to investigate the performance of every policeman. If the policeman co ncentrates on one crime, he may be accused of neglecting others. If the policeman does not arrest on suspicion a suspect with previous convictions, the police force may be held liable for subsequent crimes. The threat of litigation against a police force would n ot make a policeman more efficient. The necessity for defending proceedings, successfully o r unsuccessfully, would distract the policeman from his duties.\" 3 . Ahmed Osman and his mother lodged an application wi th the European Commission of Human Rights asserting that English law, as revealed in this dec ision, was in breach of their rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The case was r eferred by the Commission to the European Court of Human Rights. The Court unanimously upheld the claim under Article 6 of the Convention which, relevantly, provides: \"In the determination of his civil rights and oblig ations or of any criminal charges against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hear ing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by l aw ...\" Note the generality of the provision. Nothing is sa id about any particular civil obligation, let alone the law of private wrongs which encompass matters such as negligence in the common law system. The Article speaks only of what may be described as a r ight of access to justice. The European Court of Justice analysed the English case law, specifically Hill v Chief Constable of Print Page Close Window Page 1 of 8 Access to Justice and Human Rights Treaties - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_22 ... West Yorkshire. The case for the Applicants was that the dismissal by the Court of Appeal of their negligence action on the ground of public policy co nstituted to a restriction of their right of access to a court. The European Court referred to the exclusion ary rule laid down in the Hill case and concluded: \"... In the instant case the Court of Appeal proceede d on the basis that the rule provided a water-tight defence to the police and that it was impossible to prise open an immunity which the police enjoy from civil suit in respect o f their acts and omissions in the investigation and suppression of crime. The Court would observe that the application of the rule in this manner without further inquiry into the existence of competing public inte rest considerations only serves to confer a blanket immunity on the police for their a cts and omissions during the investigation and suppression of crime and amounts to an unjustifiable restriction on an applicant's right to have a determination on the me rits of his or her claim against the police in deserving cases. In its view, it must be open to a domestic court to have regard to the presence of other public interest considerations which pull in the op posite direction to the application of the rule.\" 4. The Court outlined a list of factors including the significant degree of negligence involved and the nature of the harm sustained and concluded: \"For the court, these are considerations which must be examined on the merits and not automatically excluded by the application of a rule which amounts to the grant of an immunity to the police.\" And \"The court concludes that the application of the ex clusionary rule in the instant case constituted a disproportionate restriction on the a pplicant's right of access to a court. There has accordingly been a violation of Article 6 (1) of the Convention.\" 5 . The result of these proceedings was that the Applic ant's had lost the chance of success in the proceedings. The Court would not speculate as to th e outcome of the proceedings if the statement of claim had not been struck out. Nevertheless, the lo ss of the chance was valued in the amount of \u00a310,000 together with \u00a330,000 costs. The decision in Osman has not passed without criticism. Lord Hoffman sai d: \"... this decision fills me with apprehension. Under the cover of an Article which says that everyone is entitled to have his civil rights and o bligations determined by a tribunal, the European Court of Human Rights is taking upon itsel f to decide what the content of those civil rights should be. In so doing, it is ch allenging the autonomy of the Courts and indeed the Parliament of the United Kingdom to deal with what are essentially social welfare questions involving budgetary limits and ef ficient public administration.\" 6 . As his Lordship concluded: \"It is often said that the tendency of every court is to increase its jurisdiction and the Strasbourg Court is no exception.\" 7. I have taken you to this case in order to indicate the way in which treaty obligations may impinge on a private action for damages. Human Rights treaties a re not simply concerned with matters of public law and criminal law. Much of the discussion of human r ights, whether in the context of international treaties or the in the context of a domestic Bill o f Rights, focuses exclusively on public law and cri minal law issues, to the virtual exclusion of considerati on of civil actions. Page 2 of 8 Access to Justice and Human Rights Treaties - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_22 ... Osman was a negligence case for damages. The action in t he European Court, however, had to be directed to the United Kingdom as a Nation-State fo r its failure to ensure that the British legal syst em complied with the treaty obligation on access to ju stice. The United Kingdom paid compensation on a loss of chance basis for its failure to ensure that its law conformed with its international obligatio ns. This private dimension of human rights treaties is the focus of my remarks today. Article 6 of the European Convention has its equiva lent in a Human Rights treaty to which Australia is a party. This is Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Right s (ICCPR) which relevantly provides: \"1 All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, or of his rights and o bligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law.\" By Australia's accession to the First Optional Prot ocol of the ICCPR, Australian citizens are entitled to approach the United Nations Human Rights Committee in Geneva, for a decision as to the compatibility of Australian law with Australia's ob ligations as a State Party to the Covenant. Althoug h this is not a formal judicial process, and results only in international embarrassment, it can be effective. The best known example is, of course, th e case of Toonen v Australia decided by the Human Rights Committee on 4 April 1994 to the effec t that the Tasmanian Criminal Code which criminalised male homosexual conduct violated the r ight of privacy guaranteed by Article 17 of the ICCPR. The publicity, generated in part by this dec ision, led to the Commonwealth overriding the offending State law and the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act 1994, the efficacy of which was subsequently affirmed by the High Court. The United Kingdom as part of its engagement with E urope had, in 1966, accepted the two optional clauses of the European Convention being the right of individual petition under Article 25 and the compulsory jurisdiction of the European Court under Article 46. The papers have recently been released under the 30 year rule. It is reasonably c lear that no-one had any idea as to the scope of th e jurisdiction which the European Court could assume 8 . . The exercise of rights to approach the European Cou rt is both costly and lengthy. First, all domestic remedies have to be exhausted. Secondly, until rece ntly, the application had to be made to the European Commission of Human Rights which would in turn refer the matters to the Court. In 1998, the procedures were streamlined so that the Commiss ion no longer intervened and the judicial character of the system was strengthened by the cre ation of a single full time court. More significantly, however, for purposes of Austra lian public debate is the decision by the British Parliament to incorporate the European Convention i n its domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998. This legislation is of fundamental significan ce for the practice of private law in the United Kingdom. It will radically change the process of re asoning in, and the results of, cases in English courts. The significance of the Human Rights Act was manifest in its Parliamentary treatment. Durin g the debate in the House of Lords, Lord Campbell of Allo way expressed his bewilderment with what he described as \"these esoteric lectures in law\". He p roclaimed that in his entire eighteen years in the Lords he had \"never heard anything like this after dinner\" 9. . In his Keynote Address at the Annual Conference at the Bar on the ninth of this month, the Lord Chancellor Lord Irvine of Lairg addressed the impli cation of the Human Rights Act as follows: \"The lawyers role in every country goes to the hear t of delivering justice. Like the independent judge, the independent lawyer is vital. Lawyers must use their skills fearlessly to express truth; to serve the legal nee ds of their clients; and to ensure that the court can see the case from their client's pers pective. They must be independent of the State and committed to the highest ethical stan dards. I agree with Sir Sydney Kentridge that, 'It is the independent bar inseparably from the ind ependent bench which is Page 3 of 8 Access to Justice and Human Rights Treaties - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_22 ... the protection of the citizen against the State.'\" The Lord Chancellor went on to say: \"The role of lawyers will become even more marked o n 2 October next year, with the implementation of the Human Rights Act . From the perspective of the bar, the incorporation of the European Convention on Human R ights into domestic law is perhaps the most significant element in the governm ent's programme of constitutional reform. It will give birth to a major new jurisprud ence, born out of challenges brought by lawyers; and over time, a culture of respect for hu man rights will permeate the whole of our society. The Human Rights Act 1998 offers a modern reconciliation of the tension between the democratic right of the majority to exercise politi cal power, and the democratic need of individuals and minorities to have their human righ ts secured, whilst at the same time respecting parliamentary sovereignty.\" There are four features of the Human Rights Act which will impinge significantly on English case l aw and the utility of that case law for Australian pur poses. First, by s3 of the Act the courts are obliged to i nterpret both statutes and delegated legislation \"s o far as it is possible to do so ... in a way which is comp atible with the Convention rights\". In determining a question which has arisen in relation to a Conventi on right, English courts must \"take into account\" judgments and decisions of the European Court of Hu man Rights. The second feature of the Act is that it constitute s an innovative model for the incorporation of a Bi ll of Rights in domestic law. Different levels of entrenc hment are possible. The highest is a Constitutional Bill of Rights, as in the United States. A level of entrenchment somewhat below that is the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which permits the l egislature to exempt a particular enactment from the Charter. The least entrenched is ordinary legis lation capable of amendment by the Parliament without special requirements. The British approach is in between. The Human Rights Act authorises a court, at the instance of a private litigant, to make a declaration of incompat ibility between a Convention right and a statute. Where such a declaration of incompatibility has bee n made, a Minister of the Crown may take steps to make amendments to an act of Parliament, which the Minister \"considers necessary to remove incompatibility\". Such orders require approval by r esolution by each House of Parliament. It is by thi s means that the judicial acknowledgment of the Conve ntion right is reconciled with the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty. A declaration of incompa tibility by the court will have an effect by way of embarrassment. However, the final determination as to whether or not a statute should no longer have effect is not a decision of a court, it is a decisi on of the Parliament. Whether or not an individual litigant receives the benefit of a declaration of incompatibility will de pend on the relevant Minister exercising his power to ma ke a remedial order which has effect retrospectively. This has not been considered in th e literature to which I have made reference, although some articles assume the litigant will rec eive no advantage. The power to amend legislation retrospectively, seems to me to create the possibil ity that the litigant may avoid the effect of the originally incompatible statute. A court which make s a declaration of incompatibility can stand the ca se over to await the outcome of the process of amendme nt, if any, before finally disposing of the case. The third matter to which I wish to refer is s6 of the Act which states: \"It is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.\" Where a public authority is found to have breached this provision, a court is able to make such orders or grant such relief or remedies as it considers ju st and appropriate. This will extend to damages. By force of s6, public bodies will be open to chall enge, other than pursuant to an effective incompatible statute, for breaching such Convention rights as the right to personal liberty and securi ty (Article 5); the right to a fair trial (Article 6); the right to respect for private and family life, home and Page 4 of 8 Access to Justice and Human Rights Treaties - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_22 ... correspondence (Article 8); the right to freedom of expression and assembly (Articles 10 and 11); the right to peaceful enjoyment of property (Article 1 of the First Protocol): the right to education (Art icle 2 of the First Protocol); and the right to enjoy the Convention rights and freedoms without discriminati on on the grounds of, inter alia, sex, race, religion, political or other opinion (Article 14). The range of new causes of action against public bo dies is, potentially, very wide. Furthermore, \"public authority\" is defined to inclu de \"any person certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature\". The public conduct o f private organisations will be encompassed within s6 of the Human Rights Act . There is considerable English jurisprudence on th e distinction between 'private' and 'public' in administrative law. In th at context 'public' bodies have included the Law Society, the Bar Council, the Advertising Standards Authority, the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, a product accreditation committee in the pharmaceutic al industry, and a service provider regulatory committee of telecommunication companies. All of th ese have been found to be public for administrative law purposes and are likely to be he ld liable for acting in a manner incompatible with Convention rights. The rights under the Convention that I have referre d to will now likely impinge to a significant exten t on what has hitherto been regarded as private arrangem ents. For all of these public authorities, includin g public authorities in the narrower more traditional sense, new flexible remedies are available. These are likely to sweep aside the remaining technical g rounds for judicial review in administrative law. They will also impact on a wide range of activities not hitherto subject to such review. The fourth matter to which I wish to refer is, pros pectively, the most significant from the point of v iew of private rights of action. The legislature has no t made clear the extent it intends the courts to ch ange the law with respect to cases not involving a publi c authority, as broadly defined. If the legislation is brought into effect in its present terms, this will be one of the most significant early decisions the courts will make on the construction of the Human Rights Act. The words \"public authority\" is specifically define d to include a \"court or tribunal\". Accordingly, a court is prohibited by s6 from 'acting in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right'. What does th is mean? It is one thing for a court to decide that an act a lters the rights and obligations between a public b ody and an individual - referred to in the English lite rature as the \"vertical effect\" of the Act. However , what is it that the court is obliged to do to obey the s tatutory injunction imposed on itself as a \"public authority\" when deciding a case between two private litigants? This is referred to in the English literature as the \"horizontal effect\" of the Act. There is now a considerable literature on the horiz ontal effect of the Act. 10 An expansive view of the \"horizontal effect\" has be en drawn from some general observations by the Lord Chancellor in the course of debate on the Bill about how the Convention will affect the courts development of the common law. Reference is also ma de to observations by the Home Secretary that the object was to give a remedy \"at home\" to someon e who could get a remedy in Strasbourg. The consensus view amongst human rights lawyers app ears to be that the Act will have significant horizontal effects but will not go so far as to cre ate new causes of action. It is by no means clear t o me that these predictions are supportable. Numerous di fficult decisions will have to be made by the courts. Issues of access to justice, such as that considere d in Osman's case, may now be determined as matters of domestic law enforceable in the civil co urts of England. In many ways the Human Rights Act is a logical development in view of the fact that citizens of the United Kingdom are entitled to seek redress in the European Court, against the nation, for the failure of statutes or the common law to protect their Conv ention rights. Whilst Osman involved a public authority, this would not always be the case. The European Court has developed a jurisprudence wh ich obliges State parties to change their law so as to be compatible to Convention rights. A good ex ample of this is the case of X and Y v The Page 5 of 8 Access to Justice and Human Rights Treaties - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_22 ... Netherlands 11 . . In that case the prosecutor decided not to proceed with a case against a person who sexually assaulted a mentally defective girl. The European C ourt held that the failure of the Netherlands Criminal Code to protect the victim was a violation of her right to privacy under Article 8. In its decision, the Court said: \"The Court recalls that although the object of Arti cle 8 is essentially that of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by the pu blic authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference. In addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inhe rent in an effective respect for private or family life. These obligations may involve the a doption of measures designed to secure respect for private life even in the sphere of individuals between themselves.\" 12 . English lawyers are well aware of the dramatic impa ct this new approach will have on their common law inheritance. It is confidently expected that ma ny areas of criminal justice will be radically transformed and certain other areas, such as family law, will also result in significant new litigatio n activity. Indeed, there are few areas of the law wh ich will not be impacted upon in some way or another. The construction of Article 6 as part of the domest ic law of England will impinge on access to justice issues as they arise between litigants, as well as between litigant and a government agency. For example, one issue that will arise is whether or no t the right to a hearing \"within a reasonable time\" is breached by the listing practices of the court and delays in a case being heard. At present, a litigan t who was prepared to face the further delays of proc eedings in the European Court, could be entitled to compensation from the United Kingdom. The Human Rights Act may create such a right of compensation as a matter of domestic law. Similarly, issues will arise as to whether or not a denial of a right of access to legal assistance by reason of Legal Aid rules is in accordance with Con vention rights; whether the rules of standing applicable in a particular area of the law are comp atible with those rights; whether a statute of limitations is compatible; whether rules requiring leave for the admission of evidence are compatible; whether leave requirements for instituting proceedi ngs are compatible; time limits imposed by court rules or directions may be subject to challenge; de clarations that someone is a vexatious litigant may be challengeable; contractual agreements for compul sory arbitration may be subject to review in circumstances where they do not constitute a true e xercise of free choice and where the procedures do not guarantee against abuse. Access to Legal Aid and the burden of excessive leg al costs may also give rise to issues of access to justice. Indeed, when the High Court established th e principle in Dietrich that a stay of criminal proceedings could be ordered when an accused was un able to obtain legal representation, the Court drew on international treaties, including the Europ ean Convention and its jurisprudence. 13 . There are numerous access to justice issues which, in England, may now be determined in accordance with these human rights obligations. 14 These are technical points, but often with dramatic consequences. Australian law is developing slowly in the same gen eral direction as the Human Rights Act will now take English law. Section 3 of the British Act which requires the cou rt to construe legislation in a manner which is compatible with Convention rights - the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 contains a similar provision - may already be reflected in the Austral ian law of statutory interpretation. The English material asserts that the new section goes further than the common law, which is confined to construing an ambiguous provision on the basis that Parliament was presumed to intend to legislate in accordance with its international obligations. 15 However, not without an element of irony, the word \"ambiguity\" is itself not without its own difficult ies. Page 6 of 8 Access to Justice and Human Rights Treaties - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_22 ... Generally \"ambiguity\" is understood in the sense th at a word or phrase may have more than one meaning. However, the word \"ambiguity\" is also some times used in a more general sense: that it applies to any situation in which the intention of Parliament with respect to the scope of a particula r statutory provision is, for whatever reason, doubtf ul. 16 . It is this broader approach to the concept of ambig uity which has found favour in Australia with respe ct to application of international human rights instru ments. As three members of the High Court put it: \"We accept the proposition that the court should in a case of ambiguity, favour a construction of a Commonwealth statute which accord s with the obligations of Australian under an international treaty.\" 17 However the word \"ambiguity\" in this context bears the broader meaning, namely it applies to any case of doubt as to the proper construction of a wo rd or phrase. As Mason CJ and Deane J, with whom Gaudron J agreed on this subject, said in Teoh : \"In this context, there are strong reasons for reje cting a narrow conception of ambiguity. If the language of the legislation is susceptible o f a construction which is consistent with the terms of the international instrument and the o bligations to which it imposes on Australia, then that construction should prevail. S o expressed the principle is no more than a canon of construction and does not import th e terms of the treaty or Convention into our municipal law as a source of individual ri ghts or obligations.\" 18 There is no reason why this principle of statutory construction would not now be reflected in Interpretation Acts, whether at Commonwealth or Sta te level. In the light of the broader concept of \"ambiguity\" developed in Australia, it is likely th at the jurisprudence in England and New Zealand, under their statutory provisions, will also guide t he application of the common law of statutory interpretation in Australia. The position with respect to the development of the common law will not, however, coincide. As Sir Gerard Brennan said in Mabo (No 2): \"The opening up of international remedies to indivi duals pursuant to Australia's accession to the [First] Optional Protocol to the I CCPR brings to bear on the common law the powerful influence of the covenant and the international standards it imports. The common law does not necessarily conform with intern ational law, but international law is a legitimate and important influence on the develop ment of the common law, especially when international law declares the existence of un iversal human rights.\" 19 The incorporation by the Human Rights Act 1998 of the European Convention into English law g ives rise to a radically different approach to the influ ence of international human rights instruments on t he development of the common law. It is in this respec t, more than any other, that Australian common law and that of England will progressively diverge. This will be seen in a substantial way in the new r ights of action against public authorities, includi ng private organisations exercising public functions. To the extent that the courts accept a \"horizontal effect\", this will be even more dramatic. Last year, in an address to a conference organised by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, I stressed the significance for Austral ian lawyers of these developments in England. 20 I noted that one of the great strengths of Australi an common law is that it has been able to draw on a vast body of experience from other common law juris dictions. Now both Canada and England, and to a lesser extent New Zealand, will progressively be removed as sources of influence and inspiration. This is a transition of great significance for Aust ralian lawyers. At the present time, for the vast majority of us, American Bill of Rights jurispruden ce is virtually incomprehensible. Within a decade i t is quite likely that in substantial areas of the law, British and Canadian cases will be equally incomprehensible to Australian lawyers. The Austral ian common law tradition is threatened with a Page 7 of 8 Access to Justice and Human Rights Treaties - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_22 ... degree of intellectual isolation that many would fi nd disturbing. 1.

Dedication of a Memorial to Israeli Athletes and Of ficials DEDICATION OF A MEMORIAL FOR THE ISRAELI ATHLETES AND OFFICIALS WHO LOST THEIR LIVES AT THE 1972 MUNICH OLYMPIC GAMES HOMEBUSH BAY, SYDNEY 15 OCTOBER 1999 BY THE HONOURABLE J. J. SPIGELMAN CHIEF JUSTICE OF NEW SOUTH WALES In the early hours of 5 September 1972, eight membe rs of a Black September terrorist unit broke into the quarters of the Israeli team in the Olympic Vil lage at Munich. Two Israelis were killed, nine othe rs were taken hostage. The terrorists demanded the rel ease of two hundred Arab prisoners held in Israeli, in exchange for their own safe passage out of Germany with the hostages who, they said, would later be freed. It was well known then and now, that no Israeli Gov ernment would ever negotiate in such circumstances. To do so would be an open invitation for the repetition of such terrorist acts in the future. It was the international significance of the Olympi c Games and its universally acclaimed role as a manifestation of international inclusiveness and go od will, that led these terrorists to believe that on this occasion the Israeli Government could be force d to change its usual practice. In the event, the hostages and the terrorists were killed during a failed attempt by the West German authorities to free the hostages. It is that traged y which we commemorate today. It was of abiding significance for the Olympic move ment that the German government decided to enforce the principle of not negotiating with terro rists. If the status of the Olympic Games had been acknowledged as justifying surrender to the terrori sts' demands, then generations of terrorists over t he period of almost three decades since Munich, may ha ve exploited subsequent Olympics in the same way. In a very real sense, the eleven Israelis who sacri ficed their lives at Munich did so, not just for Is rael, but for the integrity of future Olympic Games. We A ustralians, as custodians of the Olympic tradition next year, are beneficiaries of their sacrifice. It is fit and proper that we commemorate it. The tragedy of Munich was a direct onslaught on the Olympic values of internationalism, inclusiveness and respect for diversity - as reflected in the Fun damental Principles which form a preamble to the Olympic Charter, specifically: \"(3) The goal of Olympism is to place everywhere sp ort at the service of the harmonious development of man with a view to encouraging the establishment of a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity. To this effect, the Olympic movement engages, alone or in co- operation with other organisations and within the l imits of its means, in actions to promote peace. (6) The goal of the Olympic movement is to contribu te to building a peaceful and better world by educating youth through sport practised without dis crimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit which requires mutual understanding within the spir it of friendship, solidarity and fair play.\" Nothing could have been more inconsistent with thes e Principles than the terrible crimes committed in Munich in September 1972. The action of those terro rists was the antithesis of the Olympic spirit as identified by the founder and driving force of the Olympic movement, Pierre Coubertin, speaking in Athens in 1894 when he said: \"Every four years the restored Olympic Games must g ive the youth of the world the opportunity for a happy and fraternal reunion which little by little will dissipate this ignorance in which people live with respect to others, an ignorance which breeds hate, compounds misunderstandings and hastens events down the barbarous path towards merciless co nflict.\" Print Page Close Window Page 1 of 2 Dedication of a Memorial to Israeli Athletes and Of ficials - Supreme Court : Lawlink ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_15 ... Such ignorance led down precisely such a path to th e merciless events of Munich. The spirit of competition amongst athletes and betw een nations reflected in the Olympic Games allows participants and their respective publics an opportunity to express a patriotism which is posit ive and not destructive of the patriotism of others. It was such patriotism which the Israeli athletes represented and which we can all respect. We do so in the expectation that our own patriotism will be respected. The transformation by terrorism of an Olympic villa ge into a theatre for violence was an affront to al l participants in the Olympic movement. As the Presid ent of what was then West Germany, Gustav Heinemann, told the grieving crowd in the Munich Ol ympic Stadium on 6 September 1972: \"The Olympic idea is not refuted. In the name of th e Federal Republic of Germany, I call on all nation s in this world to help us conquer hatred! Help us pr epare the way of reconciliation!\" The memorial we unveil today is a monument to such reconciliation and an answer to this call. There is, regrettably, no shortage of such tragedie s to commemorate. However, some events which result in the senseless loss of life have a salienc e and significance greater than other such events. The loss of the lives we commemorate in this memori al is of this character. It was precisely because of the global significance of the Olympic games tha t these murders ignited the sympathy of people throughout the world. In Munich in 1995, a monument to the Israeli athlet es and officials was inaugurated by Walther Troeger, the President of the German National Commi ttee who had been the Mayor of the Olympic village in Munich in 1972. He recalled the spirit o f these dead athletes: \"Despite the understandable fear of the threat of d eath which faced them during their captivity they were obviously conscious of the duty which they had for their country and their people. I was the last to speak to them except for their torturers who the n became their murders. I will never forget them or their bearing.\" The memorial which we unveil today is a testament t o the human spirit displayed by those Israeli athletes and officials. This memorial will stand as dedicated, not only to the lives of the individuals who died, but also to the values of universality, inclusiveness and mutual re spect which the Olympic ideals embody. Palestinians will participate in the Sydney 2000 Ol ympics as they did, for the first time, in Atlanta. Their participation manifests the triumph of those Olympic values over the values of intolerance and violence manifested at Munich. * * * Page 2 of 2 Dedication of a Memorial to Israeli Athletes and Of ficials - Supreme Court : Lawlink ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_15 ... Seen to be Done: The Principle of Open Justice KEYNOTE ADDRESS TO THE 31ST AUSTRALIAN LEGAL CONVEN TION CANBERRA 9 OCTOBER 1999 BY THE HONOURABLE J J SPIGELMAN CHIEF JUSTICE OF NEW SOUTH WALES All lawyers will recognise the oft cited aphorism o f Lord Hewart from Rex v Sussex Justices; Ex parte McCarthy : \"... it is not merely of some importance but is of fu ndamental importance, that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.\" 1 Lord Hewart was encapsulating a principle that had been long known and often expressed 2. Another pithy articulation of part of the scope of the prin ciple is that of Lord Bowen: \"... Judges, like Caesar's wife, should be above susp icion ...\". 3 And Lord Atkin said: \"Justice is not a cloistered virtue.\" 4 The High Court has expressly applied Lord Hewart's aphorism a number of times, 5 as have other Australian courts. It appears in the Oxford Diction ary of Quotations. Must we attribute the aphorism to Lord Hewart? If w e do, the proposition that \"justice must be seen to be done\", could hardly have a less auspicious prove nance. Even the English Dictionary of National Biography, which usually confines its entries to the bland lis t of facts customarily found in a Who's Who, could not contain itself in the case of Lord Hewar t. It described him as: \"Brilliant advocate; less successful as judge throu gh tendency to forget he was no longer an advocate\".6 Can this be the author of the aphorism \"justice mus t be seen to be done\"? Lord Hewart was the Solicitor General in Lloyd Geor ge's government and, when F. E. Smith became Lord Chancellor, was promoted to Attorney General. The British practice was that an Attorney General had a right to be appointed Lord Chief Justice of E ngland, if the office fell vacant during his term o f office. When that occurred in 1921, Lloyd George re fused to dispense with Hewart's services, or at least refused to risk a by-election, but promised t o appoint him as soon as he could. Accordingly, a High Court Judge aged 78 was appointed in his stead . The very next year that new Lord Chief Justice was astonished to read of his own resignation in The Times. Hewart was Lord Chief Justice from 1922 to 1940. Professor R M Jackson in his book on The Machinery of Justice in England , referred to the system by which an Attorney General had a right of appointmen t as Lord Chief Justice in the following way: \"In 1922 this system landed the country with Lord H ewart as Lord Chief Justice, who proved to be a judge so biased and incompetent that he seems to ha ve caused a reaction against it.\"7 In the seventh edition of his book published in 197 7, Professor Jackson had referred to Hewart as \"the worst English judge in living memory\".8 This reference was deleted from the eighth edition of 1989. Perhaps in the intervening decade, other contenders had emerged for the title.

Lord Devlin, he wr ote in 1985: \"Hewart ... has been called the worst Chief Justice s ince Scroggs and Jeffries in the seventeenth century. I do not think that this is quite fair. Wh en one considers the enormous improvement in judici al standards between the seventeenth and twentieth cen turies, I should say that, comparatively speaking, he was the worst Chief Justice ever.\"9 Again I ask, must we continue to attribute this imp ortant aphorism to such a judge? Lord Hewart may very well have presided over the wo rst conducted defamation trial in legal history:10 one Hobbs suing the Nottingham Journal. Of the lita ny of misconduct found by the Court of Appeal to have been committed by Lord Hewart during the cours e of this trial, it is sufficient to note the follo wing: /circle6Rulings were made against the Plaintiff without cal ling for submissions from Counsel for the Plaintiff. /circle6His Lordship accused the Plaintiff, in front of the jury, of fraudulently concealing documents and failed to withdraw the accusation whe n informed that the document had in fact been disclosed. /circle6He permitted two days of cross-examination on matte rs of bad reputation, including allegations of criminal conduct, of a character whi ch had never been particularised. /circle6His Lordship received communications from the jury which were not disclosed to counsel. /circle6When the jury indicated a tentative view in favour of the Defendant, his Lordship orchestrated an early end to the trial. /circle6He failed to give the jury any summing up or any di rections as to the limited use they could make of the cross-examination and he failed t o leave issues to the jury. /circle6He refused to permit an adjournment of a second def amation trial against the same Defendant - suggesting the same jury should hear th e second case immediately - and entered judgment for the Defendant in the absence o f counsel for the Plaintiff. The apparent author of the aphorism \"justice must b e seen to be done\", never indicated to the jury tha t they were entitled to ignore his Lordship's numerou s expressions of opinion on the facts or his advers e comments about the veracity of the Plaintiff, upon which the Court of Appeal found it unnecessary to rule, being content with the observation of Lord Ju stice Scrutton, in accordance with the demure standards of the time, that: \"I regret that, with much better grounds available, it was thought right to insist on them.\" 11 Many would wish that appellate courts were still so reticent. The last word from this case belongs to Lord Sankey . In his judgment, his Lordship said, with referenc e to the false accusation of non disclosure, that it was \"unfortunate that the Lord Chief Justice did no t appreciate\" the correctness of certain submissions made to him and, Lord Sankey concluded: \"The Bar is just as important as the Bench in the a dministration of justice, and misunderstandings between the Bar and the Bench are regrettable, for they prevent the attainment of that which all of us desire - namely, that justice should not only be do ne, but should appear to have been done.\" 12 His Lordship cited no authority for this propositio n. Perhaps he was indulging in a little whimsy. Alternatively, perhaps Lord Sankey, who six years e arlier had merely concurred with Lord Hewart's judgment in Rex v Sussex Justices , was giving us a hint as to the true origins of th e aphorism. For myself, I am content for the future, to quote Lord Sankey. The Principle of Open Justice The principle that justice must be seen to be done - to which I will refer as the principle of open ju stice - is one of the most pervasive axioms of the administ ration of justice in our legal system. It informs a nd energises the most fundamental aspects of our proce dure and is the origin, in whole or in part, of numerous substantive rules. It operates subject onl y to the overriding obligation of a court to delive r Page 2 of 14 Seen to be Done: The Principle of Open Justice - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_09 ... justice according to law. Australian public debate has a tendency to ignore s uch fundamental principles, in the same way as we fail to appreciate the skill embedded in the engine ering infrastructure which ensures that if you flic k a switch, the lights go on or, if you turn a tap, wat er pours out. No-one thinks about it. We take it fo r granted. In this address I wish to emphasise the vital role that the principle of open justice plays in our institutional arrangements. I will then make some o bservations about how the principle should inform contemporary debate about judicial accountability. I use the word \"justice\" to mean fair outcomes arri ved at by fair procedures. To whom must justice, in this sense, appear to be done? The observer is not a party, not even the accused in a criminal trial.13 The relevant observer is always the \"fair minded ob server\", acting \"reasonably\".14 Acceptance by such an observer, should also demand acceptance by a fair minded party. The principle of open justice is reinforced by Aust ralia's ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 (ICCPR), Article 14 of which relevantly provi des as follows: 1. All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, or of his right s and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hea ring by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law. The Press and the public may be excluded from all or part of a trial for reasons of morals, public order ( ordre public ) or national security in a democratic society, or wh en the interests of private lives of parties so requires, or to the extent strictly nece ssary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudi ce the interests of justice; but any judgement rendered in a criminal case or in a s uit at law shall be made public except where the interest of juvenile persons other wise requires or the proceedings concern matrimonial disputes or the gua rdianship of children. [Emphasis added] Australia is a party to the Covenant. It is also sc heduled and annexed to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 (Cth). As such, the Covenant is not made a pa rt of Australian law. However, this method of 'quasi-incorporation' of in ternational human rights instruments - with their national reporting requirements and forums, establi shed for the discussion of those reports - renders the Covenant a powerful influence on courts in deve loping the common law. As Sir Gerard Brennan said in Mabo: \"The opening up of international remedies to indivi duals pursuant to Australia's accession to the [First] Optional Protocol to the I CCPR brings to bear on the common law the powerful influence of the Covenant a nd the international standards it imports. The common law does not neces sarily conform with international law, but international law is a legit imate and important influence on the development of the common law, especially when international law declares the existence of universal human rights.\" 15 As a principle of customary international law, the right to a fair and public hearing, enshrined in Ar ticle 14 of the ICCPR , bears on the interpretation of statutory rights a nd obligations. Statutes will be interpreted and applied, if possible, in conformity with established rules of international law. 16 We have not, however, incorporated this, or many ot her international human rights covenants, in our own law. I have on an earlier occasion referred to the long term significance of the British Human Rights Act of 1998 which incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights. The law of Britain will increasingly develop in the light of internati onal jurisprudence on human rights. So will the law of Canada under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Fre edoms and, to a lesser extent, the law of New Page 3 of 14 Seen to be Done: The Principle of Open Justice - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_09 ... Zealand under the Bill of Rights Act of 1990. 17 I repeat my comments of last year: \"We have ahead of us a transition of great signific ance for Australian lawyers. At the present time, f or the vast majority of Australian lawyers, American C onstitutional Bill of Rights jurisprudence is virtu ally incomprehensible. Within a decade it is quite likel y that in substantial areas of the law, British cas es will be equally incomprehensible to Australian lawyers. Indeed, it is already the case that the common law in England is developing, on a pre-emptive basis, i n the shadow of the jurisprudence of the European Court to an extent that limits the use of British c ases as precedents for the development of Australia n common law. This is an important turning point for Australian l awyers. One of the great strengths of Australian common law is that it has been able to draw on a va st body of experience from other common law jurisdictions. Now, both Canada and England, and to a lesser extent New Zealand, may progressively be removed as sources of influence and inspiration. Australian common law is threatened with a degree of intellectual isolation that many would fi nd disturbing.\" 18 The English Courts will have frequent occasion to c hange their procedures and substantive rules to bring them into alignment with the requirement in A rticle 6 of the European Covenant that: \"... everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearin g within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by l aw.\" The principle of open justice, should be understood as so fundamental an axiom of Australian law, as to be of constitutional significance. Indeed in the basic House of Lords decision on open courts, Scott v Scott decided in 1913, Lord Shaw described the principle as \"a sound and very sacred part of the constitution of the country and the administration of justice\". 19 His Lordship went on to say: \"To remit the maintenance of constitutional right t o the region of judicial discretion is to shift the foundations of freedom from the rock to the sand.\" 20 In 1913 a unanimous High Court followed the House o f Lords and declared: \"... there is no inherent power in a Court of justice to exclude the public in as much as one of the normal attributes of a Court is publicity, that is the admission to the public to attend proceedings.\" 21 The subject of constitutional law should not be ide ntified solely with exegesis of the terminology of the written document called \"the Constitution\".22 Our Constitution, like the British Constitution, in cludes a number of statutes which, theoretically, c an be amended by Parliament. Similarly, it includes princ iples of the common law, which can also be amended by Parliament. Nevertheless, the fundamenta l nature of some of these laws and principles, and the improbability of modifying legislation, is such as to justify treating such laws as part of constitutional law. 23 The protection of the integrity of the judicial pro cess for federal courts under Chapter III of the Constitution, which has a derivative application to State Courts, 24 does not, according to the recent decision in Nicholas v The Queen, prevent legislation which may have an adverse effec t on the reputation of courts. 25 In Nicholas, by majority, the High Court refused to strike down a statute which modified the common law principle that a court could, in its discretion , exclude evidence of a crime in which police had participated. 26 In words reminiscent of the principles expressed by Lord Shaw in Scott v Scott with respect to the Page 4 of 14 Seen to be Done: The Principle of Open Justice - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_09 ... alleged discretion court, Sir Gerard Bre nnan said: \"To suggest that the statutory will of the Parliame nt ... is to be held invalid because its application would impair the integrity of the court's processes or bring the administration of criminal justice in to disrepute is, in my respectful opinion, to misconce ive both the duty of a court and the factors which contribute to public confidence in the administrati on of criminal justice by the courts. It is for the Parliament to prescribe the law to be applied by a court and, if the law is otherwise valid, the court 's opinion as to the justice, propriety or utility of the law is immaterial. Integrity is the fidelity to legal duty, not a refusal to accept as binding a law which the court takes to be contrary to its opinion as to the proper balance to be struck between competing inter ests. To hold that a court's opinion as to the effe ct of a law on the public perception of the court is a criterion of the constitutional validity of the la w, would be to assert an uncontrolled and uncontrollable pow er of judicial veto over the exercise of legislativ e power. It would elevate the court's opinion about i ts own repute to the level of a constitutional imperative. It is the faithful adherence of the cou rts to the laws enacted by the Parliament, however undesirable the courts may think them to be, which is the guarantee of public confidence in the integr ity of the judicial process and the protection of the c ourts' repute as the administrator of criminal just ice.\" 27 As has frequently been asserted, public confidence in the courts is a critical aspect of the open just ice principle. Some aspects of judicial procedure and p ractice which ensure open justice are likely to be held to be so essential an aspect of the character of a court, that any infringement will be struck do wn as invalid. The High Court has held that legislatio n may not permissibly: \"... extend to the making of a law which requires and authorises the courts in which the judicial power of the Commonwealth is exclusively vested to exerci se judicial power in a manner which is inconsistent with the essential character of a court or with the nature of judicial powers.\" 28 The \"appearance of impartiality\" has been identifie d by Justice Gaudron as an essential characteristic. 29 The fundamental rule that judicial proceedings must be conducted in open court has often been referred to in such terms. \" 30 In Russell v Russell, the High Court, by majority, struck down a provisio n in the Family Law Act 1975, which required State Courts exercising that jurisdi ction to sit in camera. It was found that this impi nged on an essential characteristic of the Court and was , accordingly, beyond the power to invest State Courts with federal jurisdiction under s77(iii) of the Constitution. It may be difficult to resist the conclusion that a statute which required a federal court to sit in camera would infringe Chapter III. Whilst it appears that some aspects of open justice will be found to be constitutionally protected, th ere is as yet no agreement on what they might be. One h opes that the occasion for doing so will not arise. However, no-one who has witnessed what a Schumpeter ian would call the \"gales of creative destruction\" wreaked, over recent decades, on our u niversities, should have any confidence that the contemporary belief in the universal applicability of market solutions, will not pose fundamental challenges to our legal institutions. Accordingly, it is timely to recognise the principl e of open justice as one of the most fundamental ru les of our legal system. It is reflected in a wide rang e of characteristics of the judicial process and in specific rules: (i) The fundamental rule is that judicial proceedin gs must be conducted in an open court, to which the public and the press have access. 31 The exceptions to this fundamental rule are few an d are \"strictly defined\".32 As the Privy Council put it: \"Publicity is the authentic hallmark of judicial as distinct from administrative procedure.\"33 As Jeremy Bentham said: Page 5 of 14 Seen to be Done: The Principle of Open Justice - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_09 ... \"Publicity is the very soul of justice. It is the k eenest spur to exertion and the surest of all guard s against improbity. It keeps the judge, while trying , under trial.\" 34 This rule requires that a court should do nothing t o discourage the making of fair and accurate report s of what occurs in a courtroom. 35 This has important implications for the law of con tempt. The courts are not as fearful of publicity as they once may have b een. So in the case of pre-trial publicity, juries are trusted more often than previously to be true to th eir oath to determine the case on the basis of the evidence in the court and in accordance with the ju dge's directions. 36 (ii) The obligation of a court is to publish reason s for its decision, not merely to provide reasons t o the parties. 37 This has its \"foundation\" as Justice McHugh said, in \"the principle that justice must not only be done but it must be seen to be done\".38 Judges can no longer rely on the advice which Lord Mansfield gave to a general who, as governor of an island in the West Indies, had also to sit as a judge: \"Lord Mansfield said to him, 'Be of good cheer - ta ke my advice, and you will be reckoned a great judg e as well as a great commander-in-chief. Nothing is m ore easy; only hear both sides patiently - then consider what you think justice requires, and decid e accordingly. But never give your reasons; - for your judgment will probably be right, but your reas ons will certainly be wrong.'\" 39 (iii) The principle informs the determination of wh ether a function conferred on a judicial officer is incompatible with the office, under the separation of powers in the Constitution. 40 (iv) The guarantee of judicial impartiality by the disqualification for bias of a judicial officer, is determined by a test of what fair minded people - n ot just the parties, but the public - might reasona bly apprehend or suspect. 41 The High Court has expressly rejected the less str ict \"real likelihood of bias\" test. It has also applied the reasonable apprehensi on test to the conduct of a juror. 42 (v) The rule of natural justice - the obligation to accord procedural fairness by way of a hearing - i s in part based on the importance of appearances. 43 English juries would appear, however, to be made of stern stuff. The English Court of Appeal once held that a trial did not miscarry despite the fact that during the accused's counsel's address to the jury , the chairman of Quarter Sessions kept sighing and groan ing and was heard to say \"Oh God\" a number of times. 44 On another occasion, the Court of Appeal rejected a n allegation that a murder trial miscarried when th e judge appeared to be asleep for 15 minutes. The Cou rt was satisfied by a perusal of his summing up that he must have been awake and that the mere appe arance of being asleep was not enough. The Court referred to the principle that \"justice m ust be seen to be done\" as a \"hallowed phrase\" and described the appearance of the judge as inattentiv e or asleep as a \"facile\" application of the princi ple. Their Lordships concluded: \"It was not wholly without relevance that none of t he experienced counsel present found it necessary t o take steps to awaken the judge or to acquaint him w ith the fact that his appearance seemed to be less alert than it should have been.\" 45 English counsel are made of the same stern stuff as English juries. Perhaps this is an application of a principle of wa iver, which the High Court has accepted to be applicable to the right to object on the grounds of bias. 46 (vi) The power of a court to prevent abuse of proce ss is also based in part on the need to maintain public confidence in the administration of justice.47 Page 6 of 14 Seen to be Done: The Principle of Open Justice - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_09 ... (vii) The operation of various principles designed to ensure the fairness of a trial is based on appearances: for example, the prohibition of undue interference by a judge and of improper conduct by a court officer; or the obligation of a judge when sitting without a jury to enunciate any warning tha t he or she would have to give to a jury. 48 (viii) Open justice also serves the important funct ion that victims of crime, and the community genera lly, may understand the reasons for criminal sentences. 49 The significance of this function was well expressed by Warren Burger, the Chief Justice of th e United States: \"Civilized societies withdraw both from the victim and the vigilante the enforcement of criminal laws, but they cannot erase from people's consciousness the f undamental, natural yearning to see justice done - or even the urge for retribution. The crucial proph ylactic aspects of the administration of justice ca nnot function in the dark; no community catharsis can oc cur if justice is \"done in a corner [or] in any cov ert manner.\" It is not enough to say that results alone will satiate the natural community desire for \"satisfaction.\" A result considered untoward may un dermine public confidence, and where the trial has been concealed from public view an unexpected outco me can cause a reaction that the system at best has failed and at worst has been corrupted. To work effectively, it is important that society's crimin al process \"satisfy the appearance of justice.\" Offutt v United States, 348 U.S. 11, 14 (1954), and the appearance of justice can best be provided by allow ing people to observe it. ........... People in an open society do not demand infallibili ty from their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing. Whe n a criminal trial is conducted in the open, there is at least an opportunity both for understanding the system in general and its workings in a particular case.\" 50 (ix) Open justice affects the weight to be given to the public interest in the determination of claims of privilege. 51 (x) The public interest in the appearance of justic e in part explains the reluctance to order a stay o f criminal proceedings. 52 (xi) The role of legal practitioners as officers of the Court creates a public interest to restrain a legal practitioner from acting against a former client, w hich is also reflected in scepticism about the effi cacy of 'Chinese walls'.53 As Justice Bryson put it, in a frequently cited cas e: \"Cautious conduct by the court is appropriate becau se the spectacle or the appearance that a lawyer can readily change sides i s very subversive of the appearance that justice is being done. The appearan ce which matters is the appearance presented to a reasonable observer who k nows and is prepared to understand the facts.\"54 Judicial Accountability The central significance of public confidence in th e administration of justice is mentioned in virtual ly every case which refers to the principle of open ju stice. Public confidence is primarily maintained by the practical operation on a daily basis of the princip les of open justice. As Justice Gummow has said, th e maintenance of public confidence in the administrat ion of justice \"in present times, is the meaning of the ancient phrase 'the majesty of the law' .\" 55 The principle of open justice, in its various manif estations, is the basic mechanism of ensuring judic ial accountability. The cumulative effect of the requir ements to sit in open court, to publish reasons, to accord procedural fairness, to avoid perceived bias and to ensure the fairness of a trial, is the way the judiciary is held accountable to the public. The \"public \" which, in a democracy, the judiciary serves, must n ot be understood in any immediate Page 7 of 14 Seen to be Done: The Principle of Open Justice - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_09 ... populist sense. The the \"public\" u nderstood as a historical continuum: acknowledging debts to previous generations and obligations to fu ture generations. The relationship between the principle of open just ice and judicial accountability has been emphasised by Chief Justice Gleeson, who said: \"The corollary of the obligation of judges to condu ct their business in public, and to give reasons for their decisions, is that they are exposed and are regularly subjected, to public comment and criticism. The pra ctical importance of this should not be underestimated, especially in an age when at titudes towards authority are no longer deferential, and are frequently the oppos ite. Being a judge is not a suitable occupation for the thin skinned.\" 56 His Honour said with respect to the obligation to g ive reasons: \"This form of accountability is not to be taken lig htly. The requirement of giving a fully reasoned explanation for all decisions has pr ofound importance in the performance of the judicial function. Apart from ju dges, how many other decision makers are obliged, as a matter of routine, to stat e, in public, the reasons for all their decisions? Most decisions, other than those m ade by judges, are made by people who may choose whether or not to give their reasons.\"57 The principle of open justice is an important aspec t of the quality of judicial decision-making. The openness of the process and the necessity for reaso ns ensures that judicial conduct is subject to the spur of close scrutiny, particularly by the legal c ommunity, but also by the general community. As Sir Harry Gibbs put it: \"It is the ordinary rule of the Supreme Court ... tha t their proceedings shall be conducted 'publicly an d in full view' ( Scott v Scott at 200). This rule has the virtue that the proceed ings of every court are fully exposed to public and professional scrutiny and cri ticism, without which abuses may flourish undetected.\"58 Lord Diplock expressed similar sentiments when he s aid: \"If the way courts behave cannot be hidden from the public ear and eye this provides a safeguard against judicial arbitrariness or idiosyncrasy ....\". 59 Impartiality, it has truly been said, is the suprem e judicial virtue. 60 By the judicial oath, judges undertake to act \"without fear or favour, affection or ill will\". However, impartiality must not only exist, it must be palpable. The High Court has made it quite clear that in Australia the test for determining th at a judge has been or might be actuated by bias is wh ether or not fair-minded people might reasonably apprehend or suspect that the judge has pre-judged or might pre-judge the case. 61 The test of bias based on appearance is a crucial m anifestation of the principle of open justice. The maintenance of impartiality, not only the actuality but the appearance thereof, is the point at which judicial independence and judicial accountability i ntersect. There is no incompatibility between accountability by open justice and judicial indepen dence. Indeed they are closely intertwined principl es. Open justice is also one of the most significant gu arantees of personal liberty. The principle of the separation of powers must be seen to be in operatio n as a practical reality. For example, a relationsh ip between the bench and the prosecution in the crimin al process which can be described as \"too close\", is by no means unknown in our history. However, as Viscount Dilhorne put it: \"A judge should stay out of the arena. He should no t have or appear to have any responsibility for the institution of a prosecution.\"62 Similar principles apply in a civil trial. Page 8 of 14 Seen to be Done: The Principle of Open Justice - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_09 ... There is a clear movement towards managerial judgin g - the direct involvement of judges in the preparation for and the conduct of proceedings. Thi s is in part motivated by new pressures for accountability as to how courts spend public resour ces. Nevertheless, there are very real limits on th e extent to which such involvement can be taken, cons istently with the principles of open justice. There is an inevitable tension between the contempo rary pressures on courts to maximise throughput and the principle that justice must be seen to be d one. In 1936 the Privy Council held that a divorce trial was voidable because the judge had sat in a r oom which had a sign saying \"Private\" on the door. The Judicial Committee said: \"Publicity goes far to prevent the trial of these a ctions, where one is superficially so much like ano ther, from becoming stereotyped and standardised, so that the ability to dispose of them is even now, apparently, regarded in some quarters as the convin cing test of judicial efficiency.\"63 Such attitudes have returned with greater virulence . I do not mean to suggest that improvements in judicial efficiency have not been required, nor tha t further improvements cannot occur. My proposition is that many advocates of such measures have an ina dequate understanding of the way that such steps may adversely affect other values and of the incompatibility of some such measures with fundamental principle, including the principle of o pen justice. I am, of course, conscious of the fact that there a re limits to the proportion of the gross national p roduct that we can afford to expend on the legal system. T hat system is not immune to the effects of the substantial shift in attitude to the public sector which has had significant, and often adverse, impac ts on many other areas of government. However, the proces s of adapting to this most recent swing of the pendulum about the proper role of government, must proceed with caution in the case of institutional arrangements which have taken centuries to develop and which can be destroyed in years. We should not underestimate the significance - not least to our economy - of the broadly based acceptance of the institutional legitimacy of the a dministration of justice. It is institutional legitimacy that explains one gr eat marvel of our social system: why do the overwhelming majority of Australians obey the law, and refrain from taking the law into their own hands, even when the risk of detecting a breach is low and the application of a deterrent sanction eve n lower? The operation of open justice is an importan t determinant of this institutional legitimacy. Thi s phenomenon could not be replicated by market forces . I do not wish in any way to be understood to doubt the importance of courts accepting accountability f or the use to which they put public funds of which the y are the custodian. Nevertheless, there is a tendency to equate courts with bureaucracies in bot h the approach taken and the terminology employed with respect to these matters. This is a f undamentally pernicious development which ought be resisted. The development of performance measurements by mean s of benchmarking operates under the auspices of the Council of Australian Governments ( COAG). The present system continues an initiative of the Premier's Conference of July 1993 in, what w as called, the Review of Government Service Provision. This Review is supervised by a Steering Committee chaired by the chair of the Productivity Commission. Each area of government activity is sup ported by a working group which, in the case of the legal system, is the Court Administration Worki ng Group. All aspects of this process are being pursued with a single ideology and a single methodology. A system of performance benchmarking is established, pursuant to which performance indicators are developed and published. In the case of the judicia l system, the terminology is misleading, perhaps dangerously so. The courts do not deliver a \"servic e\". The courts administer justice in accordance wit h law. They no more deliver a \"service\" in the form o f judgments, than the Parliaments deliver a \"servic e\" in the form of statutes. This recent development of contemporary public admi nistration draws heavily on an analogy with the private sector and seeks to replicate the incentive s and sanctions of a market system in areas of activity in which a market does not directly operat e. I do not doubt for a moment that this approach c an supply valuable insights and lead to important refo rms. There is, however, a tendency amongst the practitioners of this new approach to public admini stration to regard the focus of their own activitie s as in some respects more important than the activities which they supervise. Page 9 of 14 Seen to be Done: The Principle of Open Justice - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_09 ... More significantly, there is a marked tendency to d evalue aspects of these activities of others which are incapable of measurement. With respect to the legal system these deficiencies are capable of causing significant distortions. The tendency to regard the courts as providing some kind of \"service\" has cre pt into the terminology of all aspects of government d ecision-making with respect to the courts and, most particularly, with respect to decision-making about the allocation of resources. It is important that these tendencies should be counter-balanced by a broader appreciation of the functions performed by the legal system as a manifestation of government. In particular, the tendency to give quantitative me asurements a quite disproportionate influence in th e making of decisions, particularly on the allocation of resources, which arises from the very concreteness of statistics against the more amorpho us quality of principle, is a tendency that must be resisted. Not all areas of government are capable of being mo ulded by analogy with the operation of a free market. There are important areas of government act ivity in which market forces have been introduced with substantial benefits to the community as a who le. However, the administration of justice is not a n area in which such an analogy has much that is usef ul to contribute. Few advocate that commercial corporations should conduct their affairs in public , nor that they should publish reasons for their decisions, or observe any of the other principles o f open justice. Nor should the dynamics of commercial corporations be seen as having any parti cular relevance for the administration of justice. One characteristic of open justice is its inefficie ncy when compared with private or secret justice. T here is no doubt that a much greater volume of cases cou ld be handled by a specific number of judges if they could sit in camera, not be constrained by obl igations of procedural fairness or the need to prov ide a manifestly fair trial, and not have to publish re asons for their decisions. Even greater \"efficiency \" would be quickly apparent if judges had made up the ir minds before the case began. There are places where such a mode of decision-making has been, and indeed is being, followed. We do not regard them as role models. Open justice does not provide the most efficient mode of dispute resolution. Nor, indeed, does democracy provide the most efficient m ode of government. Yet the major pressure on the courts, like other pa rts of the public sector, is to increase throughput without increased resources. I am reminded of the micro economic reformer who no ted that a Mozart String Quartet takes as long to perform in 1999 as it did in 1799. In short, in two hundred years there had been no productivity improvement whatsoever. Plainly, this could only be the result of a collusive arrangement amongst professional musicians. The matter needs to be inve stigated by the ACCC. Some things take time. Justice, and in particular t he appearance of justice, is one of them. No doubt there is an economist somewhere who would classify this as some form of trade off between quality and quantity, but this very perspective fails to gi ve weight to the public interest involved and, specifically, fails to understand the significance of institutional legitimacy. I repeat, the courts do not provide a public funded dispute resolution service to litigants as consume rs. The courts perform a core function of government: t he administration of justice according to law. A dispute resolution \"service\" can be delivered mor e economically in private. Indeed, privacy is frequently cited as a motive for participating in a lternative dispute resolution. Although mediation a nd arbitration have important roles to play, we should not, however, forget the public interest that is s erved by open justice. It is the qualitative dimension of open justice whi ch requires one to treat with reserve the role of \"performance indicators\", which appear to treat cou rts as accountable for their performance only in quantitative terms. In the former Soviet Union, one of the few things o f which they had no shortage was performance indicators. They called it a five year plan. There are a number of classic examples as to how such performance indicators distort decision-making. My favourite comes from Nikita Krushchev in one of his speeches critical of the controllers of heavy indus try, whom he dismissed as \"steel eaters\". He pointe d out that the five year plan had for many years cont ained a performance indicator for nail manufacturer s expressed in the form of tonnes of nails. This prov ed to be inadequate as every factory made a huge number of big nails and virtually no small nails. I n order to overcome the shortage of small nails, a new five year plan expressed the performance indicator in terms of numbers of nails, rather than tonnes. Page 10 of 14 Seen to be Done: The Principle of Open Justice - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_09 ... The obvious occurred: within a few years there was a shortage of big nails. When deploying such performance indicators in terms of accountability, we must never lose sight of the qualitative dimension. Open justice cannot be measu red. Open justice, not statistics, must continue to be regarded as the basic mechanism of judicial acco untability. I do not wish to suggest that accountability for fi nancial expenditure is not important. However, if i t provides the primary input to decisions about alloc ation of resources, then the fundamental function performed by the legal system may be compromised. I ndeed, taken too far, it will threaten the very market system in the name of which the process has been instituted. There is a tendency amongst economists to regard \"t he market\" as a product of nature, as unorganised as a medieval bazaar. It is not. The \"market\" is a sophisticated human creation and, more than anything else, it is a creation of good government and of the law. Without the protection of property and the enforcement of contracts, no market system can operate. In the Town Hall of Sienna there are two wonderful frescoes by Lorenzetti: Allegories of Good Government and of Bad Government. Even a cursory gl ance at the latter, with its depiction of decay and chaos, would convince anyone that without law, there can be no market system. Conclusion The principle of open justice did not emerge in our legal history by a process of deduction from an abstract ideal. Like all other important aspects of our legal system, the principle was derived from observation of the actual practice of dispute resol ution over long periods of time which, once recognised as a principle, influenced further devel opment of the practice. The word \"court\", in the sense of the judicial inst itution, shares a common origin with a royal or aristocratic \"court\" which, of its nature, involved a broader range of persons than the immediate disputants. The early use of juries as representati ves of the community, also implied public access. Such are the pragmatic origins of fundamental princ iple in the common law. 64 During a period of this nation's history when the p ressures of global events are imposing radical change on all of our institutions, we must learn to stop taking important things for granted. We must, at least occasionally, rearticulate the rationale for our fundamental principles, so that we do not lose their benefit, without intending to do so. I have in mind, particularly, the way in which the standards of commercialism have swept aside other values, and dominate public debate to an unpreceden ted degree. It is noticeable that although once our cities were dominated by public buildings - par liament, court, town hall, cathedral - now all are dwarfed by commercial office blocks, and public bui ldings or are now often constructed in indistinguishable form. There are dangers in such u niformity. Diversity in the values served by social institutio ns is as significant for the health of our society, as bio- diversity is for our ecology. The values of truth, justice and fairness, which are served by the legal system, are not necessarily compatible with the unb ridled operation of market forces. At times the belief in the universal applicability of market forces, borders on monomania. The common law has seen off a number of monomanias. In the pas t they have tended to come in the form of religion. It once came in the form of the divine ri ght of kings. It now comes in the form of the divin e right of markets. No claim to universality is compatible with the pursuit of truth, open justice and fairnes s. Even in economics there is proof of the significanc e which ordinary people attach to the perception of fairness. Economists have created an experiment called \"the u ltimatum game\".65 In the ultimatum game one person is given a sum of money which he is instruct ed to offer to the second player. If the second player accepts the amount he can keep what is offer ed and the first player gets to keep the rest. If t he second player rejects the offer neither player gets anything. No bargaining is allowed. On the basis o f the usual assumptions of rational behaviour and pur suit of self interest, an economist would predict t hat the first player will offer a minimal amount and th e second player will accept it. This is not what happens. Offers usually average between 30 and 40 p ercent. Offers less than 20 percent are usually Page 11 of 14 Seen to be Done: The Principle of Open Justice - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_09 ... rejected. An offeree feels mistreated in a contemptuous way b y a minimal offer. It is not fair. He would rather get nothing. Offerors expect and understand that his wi ll happen. They make offers likely to be perceived to be fair. There is a great deal of wisdom deeply embedded in institutions which have grown and adapted to changing circumstances over long periods of time. I t is a regrettable characteristic of much Australia n public debate, that it proceeds on the basis that h istory is of little significance. That is reflected in some discussion of judicial accountability. We do not often assert, indeed it seems we are some times reluctant to admit, that we draw on an institutional tradition of at least 800 years. More significantly we should recognise and reject the underlying assumption that 'history' is something t hat happened somewhere else. This year, the Supreme Courts of Tasmania and of Ne w South Wales, celebrated the 175th Anniversary of their foundation. 66 By any standards, those are old institutions. The nations that have judicial institution of such vintage, can be number ed on the fingers of one hand. We Australians like to think of ourselves as a youn g country. However, when it comes to the basic mechanisms of governance - parliamentary democracy and the rule of law - this is not a young country, this is an old country. Our courts have a continuou s institutional existence of 175 years. Representat ive and responsible government is almost 150 years old. We will soon celebrate the centenary of Federation. These are old traditions. Fundamental values - like the principle of open jus tice - on which these successful institutions are based, have served us well. The expression of these values in actual institutional arrangements and practices will continue to adapt - as they have bee n adapting for centuries - to changing demands and social conditions. The preservation of those values requires continued vigilance. _________ Endnotes: 1. R v Sussex Justices; Ex parte McCarthy [1924] 1 KB 256 at 259. 2.

Address to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the U niversity of Sydney, 6 September 1999 ADDRESS BY THE HONOURABLE J J SPIGELMAN CHIEF JUSTICE OF NEW SOUTH WALES UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY PARLIAMENT HOUSE DINNER 6 SEPTEMBER 1999 We assemble here today only a few yards from the ch amber of the Legislative Council, now occupied by the Legislative Assembly of the New South Wales Parliament, in which on 6 September 1849 William Charles Wentworth moved the resolution for the establishment of a committee to inquire into the creation of a University. That committee, chair ed by Wentworth, reported within 15 days and, within a similar period, on 4 October 1849, Wentwor th moved the Second Reading of the University Bill in the Legislative Council. Accordingly, this day represents the 150th Annivers ary of a critical stepping stone for the creation o f the University of Sydney: a prelude, our invitation for tonight's dinner states - perhaps even an overture - to the sesquicentenary celebrations whic h the University will commence to celebrate next year. The legislative chamber in which Wentworth delivere d the two speeches to which I have referred, is one of the oldest parliamentary chambers in continu ous use anywhere in the world. It is well, on occasions like this, for us to pause and reflect on just how old many of our most important institutio ns are. Australians like to think of this as a young countr y. However, in many respects, and particularly in t he basic mechanisms of governance, this is not a young country. This is an old country. On 17 May of this year the Supreme Court of New Sou th Wales celebrated the 175th Anniversary of its foundation. The number of nations which have ju dicial institutions of such vintage can be counted on the fingers of one hand. The Supreme Court and the first Legislative Council were both created under the New South Wales Act, a statute of the British Parliament of 1823. T hat was the first written constitution in Australia n history. The beginnings of representative governmen t occurred over 150 years ago. In a few years we will celebrate 150 years of representative and resp onsible government - the pursuit of which was, perhaps, the single most important theme of Wentwor th's political life. The twin great institutional traditions of our civi lisation - the rule of law and the need for consent of the governed - form part of the core content of Austral ian national identity. Their force today, reflected in the universal acceptance of the legitimacy of the i nstitutions which perform these functions, is deriv ed in large measure from the longevity of the traditio ns by which they are performed. There is an embedded wisdom in institutions which have grown an d developed over long periods of time. It is fitting that we commemorate anniversaries of the ch aracter we gather here today to mark. The speech which Wentworth gave on 6 September 1849 reveals some of the strengths of our society, strengths which have enabled us to enjoy a history of economic prosperity and social stabilit y, which is reflected in the longevity of our institut ions, and which most nations in the world have reas on to envy. The William Charles Wentworth of 1849, was no longe r the firebrand of the 1820s when he returned from Britain with his legal qualifications and univ ersity experience. Shortly after his return he was admitted as one of the first two barristers of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Immediately upon his admission, he moved a motion in the Court that henceforth, as was the custom in England, solicitors should no longer be permitted rights of audience in the court.

It is pertinent to note that in 1846, one of Wentwo rth's political rivals, Robert Lowe, supported legislation which would have lead to the amalgamati on of the two branches of the legal profession. At that stage Australians who wished to be admitted to the Bar had to go to England and take up residence at one of the Inns of Court merely, as Lo we put it, \"to eat 36 dinners there\". Lowe argued, in terminology which is reminiscent of recent debates, for \"Free Trade in Law\". He maintained that the \"barrister monopoly\" was \"a tax on the administrati on of justice\". Wentworth protested that the Bill would destroy the dignity of the legal profession b y making barristers stoop to collect their own fees . Some things change very little. Although this measure was defeated, a highlight of the debate was the necessity, if separation of the two branches of the legal profession were to contin ue, to establish a means of training Australians fo r the independent Bar, without the cost and inconveni ence of travel to England. Lowe and Wentworth both agitated for the creation of a University, int er alia, by reason of this need. Similar demands ca me from the medical profession. Both Lowe and Wentworth were members of the committ ee established by the resolution of the 6 September 1849 and which reported with such commend able speed. I wish to highlight two aspects of the speech that Wentworth delivered 150 years ago today. The first, the personal origins of an individual in either con vict status or freedom, was the dominant social div ide of the first century of Australian life. The second subject, conflict amongst the major Christian denominations, lays claim to be the dominant social divide of the second century of Australian life. Wentworth, as is well known, was the son of a convi ct mother. Notwithstanding his education, his contribution to society and his obvious personal ca pacity - not always consistently displayed - his entire public life was marred by a battle for socia l acceptance. His speech of 6 September 1849 refers on a number of occasions to the \"tainted population \" of the colony of New South Wales. He propounded the greater responsibility of the Govern ment of a convict colony to provide for education than in other British colonies, without such \"moral taint\". He said: \"If it was the duty of the State to instruct the fr ee and virtuous population of those colonies, how much greater the necessity to enlight en the tainted population of this. The governments of those colonies had to deal only with the ignorance of untaught multitudes - here it was the duty of the government to do all in its power to subdue their vices.\" The Hansard report of this speech indicates that at this point members of the Council burst into cries of \"Here here\". This debate reflected the passions that convict ori gins could still incite at this time, and their significance to the social, economic and political life of the colony. However, within a few decades, other than in the most narrow of conservative circl es of ever reducing size, this, the most important social issue of the early decades of colonial life, had passed into irrelevancy. This was the first manifestation of an extraordinar y capacity for adaptation which our social institut ions have displayed on a number of occasions, including the second theme of Wentworth's address - the importance of religious differences - but also more recently in the absorption into our society of wav es of non-Anglo Celtic migration. As I have said a second theme - perhaps the main th eme - of Wentworth's two addresses on the 6 September and 4 October was the importance of creat ing a secular institution. All proposals for public involvement in education had been bedevilled by the claims of the various denominations to control the education of their adherents. Indeed early in h is political career, Wentworth had conducted a campaign opposing plans by the Anglican establishme nt to create what would have been, effectively, a monopoly of educational provision in the colony. The proposal which Wentworth put forward in his spe ech of 6 September 1849, which the committee endorsed and, indeed, which was established, was fo r a tertiary institution free from religious teachi ng, so that no sectarian influences would impinge thems elves upon the educational process and, accordingly, that members of all denominations coul d allow their adherents to attend. A compromise, somewhat characteristic of our society, was put for ward in the form of affiliating denominational colleges to the University so that the religious in struction, which most then thought to be essential, Page 2 of 3 Address to celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the U niversity of Sydney, 6 September ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_06 ... could occur within the context of those colleges, b ut not in the University itself. At that time, of course, Cambridge and Oxford were Anglican institutions with a strict religious test for entry. The non-denominational University of London had only recently been established. However, as Wentworth pointed out during the course of debate, the Universities of Scotland and of Ireland had no religious test. The then controversial nature of th is proposal was manifest in the refusal of the Angl ican Bishop of Sydney to nominate a member to the first Senate. The social division between Catholics and Protestan ts, overlapping as it did very substantially with class divisions, remained of central significance i n our society until comparatively recently. When I was pursuing my legal studies at this University in the late 60s, only 30 years ago, the significance of this division was quite apparent in the law. There were law firms in this city which had never had a Catholic employee, let alone partner. There were ot hers, which had never had a Protestant. The position of Commissioner of Police was filled alter natively by a Catholic and a Mason and that remained the case for many years. However, over the last three decades this basic social divide has dissipated. A sense of harmony has replaced longsta nding tensions. The speed and frictionless nature of this transition is another manifestation of the extraordinary strength of our social institutions a nd their capacity for adaptation. The report of the 1849 Committee contrasted the fai lure to create a university after sixty two years o f British settlement with the position in the United States. The Report said: \"The University of Harvard, to our shame be it ment ioned, was established by the Pilgrim Fathers of New England in less than twenty years after its set tlement.\" In his speech of 6 September 1849, Hansard reported Wentworth to have said: \"He should not weary the House by enumerating the e ndowments of the educational establishments of the United States. It would be sufficient to say that the endowment generally did not proceed from the revenue of the State.\" Even at that early stage, the contrast between Aust ralian and American traditions of philanthropy was clear. It has remained so since. Nevertheless, over the century and a half of its existence, this University has been able to attract substantial pri vate support by Australian standards. I am sure everyone present is acutely aware that contemporary developments in government funding make such support more necessary than ever. It would be appropriate to conclude this address wi th a quotation from one of Wentworth's two speeches. However, the modern ear is not well attun ed to the bombast of Victorian rhetoric. Suffice it to say that Wentworth's comments were particularly focussed on a patriotic assertion of the potential contribution of Australians to education and to civ ilisation. After 150 years they remain worthy and noble sentiments, appropriate for commemoration.

Women Lawyers Association of NSW ADDRESS BY THE HONOURABLE J J SPIGELMAN CHIEF JUSTICE OF NEW SOUTH WALES SHERATON ON THE PARK 25 AUGUST 1999 The constraints of a luncheon address are such as t o require concentration on no more than one or two subject matters. More would run the risk of bei ng exceedingly glib. I have chosen to concentrate on the potential impact of technology on the prospe cts of greater workplace flexibility, in the intere sts of ensuring that women can fully participate in thi s legal profession to which we all belong. It is now widely recognised that women in all forms of employment have imposed upon them difficulties which men simply do not have. Difficul ties arise from the requirements of raising a famil y and the maintenance of domestic arrangements genera lly. This goes well beyond the obvious biological necessities to the fact that as a matter of choice, to some extent constrained by social expectations which are not likely to dissipate in t he foreseeable future, women assume a disproportionate burden of meeting the demands of c hildren and domestic tasks. Workplace expectations in all of the spheres in whi ch legal professionals are employed, but perhaps particularly in the context of private firms, also limit opportunities for men to participate in famil y life. But there is no doubt, as a matter of practical rea lity, the impact is much greater on women than it i s on men. The dramatic expansion in women's participation in the work force, including at all levels of the lega l system, happens to have coincided with a considerab le intensification of pressures on employees, particularly in white collar, or as they are someti mes now referred to lace collar, occupations. The pressures of globalisation and the increase of conc ern with economic efficiency and productivity reflect what is, in this country, described as econ omic rationalism. In England it is described in mor e gender specific terms as \"Thatcherite\". Many of the more leisurely practices of professiona l conduct and judicial conduct of past years have disappeared. At the time that such practices were c ommon they would have been, and indeed were, described, not inaccurately, as \"gentlemanly\". No a spect of legal practice, including the conduct of proceedings in court, could be so described today. The pressure of billable hours targets, early and late working hours, touting for business after hour s, administrative and, even, judicial performance targets is unremitting and, indeed, ubiquitous. It appears, everything must have productivity improvements on a regular basis. Indeed, one recalls the example of the ardent econo mic reformer who noticed that a Mozart string quartet was played in exactly the same time in 1999 as it had taken in 1799. In other words in 200 years there had been no productivity improvement. T his obviously manifested a collusive arrangement amongst professional musicians and must be investig ated by the ACCC. Contemporary work place pressures on women, which a rise from the disproportionate burden that women assume in caring for children and maintaining domestic arrangements, operate as a significant impediment on advance in any profession, and partic ularly in the legal profession. I do not ignore the fact that some women do have domestic arrangements of a different character, including many who do not have children. Nevertheless, the majority do , or wish to do so. Their employability and their promotion is significantly affected by demands of t he workplace which are inconsistent with these greater burdens. There are the biological necessities of pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding, all of which involve restrictions on the ability to devote long continuo us periods of time to work, indeed in some respects require interruptions of significant lengths. Furth ermore, personal choice or social expectations even after breastfeeding has stopped, operative through to the end of schooling, are such as to continue to Print Page Close Window Page 1 of 4 Women Lawyers Association of NSW - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_25 cause interruptions and restrict the amount of cont inuous time that can be devoted to work to an extent quite disproportionate to that to which men are subject. Over and above that effect are practices with respect to domestic arrangements unr elated to children. There is no doubt there have many changes in variou s areas of legal employment which have introduced more flexible working practices. It appe ars true that such accommodation is more widely spread in the public sector than the private sector . That is, no doubt, part of the explanation of the comparatively high proportion of women lawyers empl oyed in the public sector. Amongst these changes are maternity leave, job sharing, short hou rs, flexitime, working from home, part time work, outsourcing and preparedness on the part of employe rs to focus work tasks such as redirection away from long trials or work involving extensive travel . However these flexible arrangements may result in a perception of marginalisation of the employees who receive the benefit of them. On occasions, 'out of sight' means 'out of mind', when it comes to promotions, assignments and secondments. There is a pervading work culture in which it is regarded as a mark of 'seriousness' and of 'success', that a legal professional is seen to be 'putting in the hours'. This is understood as a manifestation of co mmitment and performance and, not least, billable hours. There are also understandable concerns by cl ients about limits on accessibility. They increasingly demand instant access at a time of the ir own choosing. The protection of professional aloofness has long since dissipated. Flexible working arrangements do impose restriction s on the ability to develop a professional career, including limitations on opportunities to tout for business and to engage in networking with clients, superiors and colleagues. Interruptions to continui ty of work are capable of adverse consequences on a career. Not being able to travel extensively for work purposes, not being able to be involved in lon g trials or matters which require undivided attention for significant periods of time, will necessarily limit opportunities for displaying talent and the develop ment of professional skills. These adverse affects arise because there is a para digm of conduct which is regarded as 'normal'. That paradigm requires immediate and continuous ava ilability in the form of physical propinquity. It i s this aspect upon which contemporary technology impi nges. Modern technology makes physical presence or propinquity optional in many circumstan ces. Over recent decades there have been numerous predic tions of the imminent arrival of the paperless office or of telecommuting by modems, faxes and tel ephones. Whilst all of these phenomena have progressed to some extent - more limited than many predictions - the idea of what is 'normal' has not changed. However, it may. The principal idea I wish to propound this afternoo n is that women have an interest in changing the paradigm of 'normal' conduct of workplace relations in a direction which creates an alternative paradigm that does not require physical propinquity . All of the technologies that I have mentioned wil l assist in that regard. One technology, if fully dep loyed, has particular promise of overcoming the eff ect of flexible working practices as leading to the mar ginalisation of the beneficiaries of such practices . I refer to video links and video conferencing. Set top video conferencing systems are now availabl e for a few thousand dollars. Real time, interactive, audio visual communications using an e xisting television set are now available for a cost which is feasible for many professionals. Higher le vels of quality and sophistication can be acquired at a price. The crucial issue is not capital cost but user charges. All existing delivery systems are cap able of being employed - the standard copper telephone l ine, as well as the optical fibre networks and satellite delivery. Video conferencing opens the possibility of a degre e of direct contact and sense of presence, which other forms of telecommunications do not offer. It is for this reason that the utilisation of video conferencing, once it becomes sufficiently common, may counteract the marginalisation attendant on working from home. Similar benefits may result from other technologies, such as the use of real time transcript, which is made immediately available via the Internet to members of the legal team who are out of court, perhaps interstate, perhaps at home. The dynamics of technological innovation are such t hat predicting the speed of introduction and integration of different technologies, increasingly using the nearly universal Internet protocol, is v ery Page 2 of 4 Women Lawyers Association of NSW - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_25 ... difficult. For example, the origins of the fax mach ine lay in the fact that the Japanese believed they suffered a competitive disadvantage by reason of th e complexity of their character based written language in the previous generation of business com munication hardware, namely the telex. A means of transmitting visual characters needed to be inve nted. It was. Real time transcript had its origins in the needs o f hearing impaired people, whether as parties or as witnesses, who found it impossible to follow court proceedings in which they were involved. The early use of video conferencing was with respect to vulne rable witnesses, particularly children, giving evidence from a nearby room on a closed circuit sys tem, in order to avoid being in the physical presence of an accused who had abused or threatened them. To date, the steps that have been taken by the cour t system in the deployment of these various technologies have been experimental and somewhat te ntative. Nevertheless the success is such that courts are now ready, subject to availability of fu nds, to adopt a more integrated and determined approach. Within the month the Supreme Court will h ave available a fully equipped technology court which will enable integrated electronic communicati ons including video conferencing, real time transcript and electronic document management. This will offer a permanent facility instead of the ad hoc arrangements that have been made from time to t ime. The most common use of video conferencing in courts throughout Australia has been to take evidence from specific witnesses, often overseas witnesses, whose travel to the court would be either impossible, grossly inconvenient, or disproportiona tely expensive. However, the uses have multiplied. In the Supreme Court we have for many years had dir ect video links to Long Bay and Silverwater gaols for purposes of bail applications. This has e nabled the Department of Corrective Services to avoid both the costs and the security risks associa ted with transporting prisoners. The High Court has for many years conducted Special Leave Applications from some cities, such as Brisbane, via a video link. Courts have had legal representatives conduct appeals via video link for a client who is unable to afford the added expense of interstate travel, with the appellate bench and the other legal representatives being in a different city. Recently , in the Federal Court, objection was taken to a ju dge sitting on the morning of an appeal, a new judge wa s brought in and \"sat\" on the court, via video connection. Not all of these uses are necessarily cost effectiv e. The cost of travel may very well be less than th e user charges for the connection. However, many are cost effective when the opportunity cost of the time of participants in the legal system is to be t aken into account. It is this, more than anything e lse which will drive the use of video conferencing and other technologies in the future. For example, much routine police evidence can be gi ven from a police station, which will save the considerable amount of police time used in travelli ng to and from court and waiting to be called. Similarly, much medical evidence can be given from a video conferencing facility in a hospital or medical centre with considerably less disruption to normal medical practice. Other specialists may also find the investment in a video conferencing li nk appropriate. The Victorian Court system has developed a network for the use of video conferenci ng including a link to the Police Forensic Science Laboratories. Evidence is given all over the State by forensic experts, with the assistance of equipment which allows them to display objects and fingerprints in magnified form in the relevant courtroom. Cost efficiencies and improvement of ser vices, particularly in rural and regional areas, wi ll constitute a significant spur to the deployment of this and other technologies. I do not wish to suggest that these technologies ar e appropriate in every circumstance. In the case of witnesses whose credit is critical, a virtual court room is unlikely to be an acceptable alternative, a t least for the foreseeable future. Nor do I wish to minimise the significance of the direct personal contact in a courtroom. Nevertheless, a great deal of cost saving and improvement in efficiency is possible from the deployment of such technology. Let me give you an example of the conduct of direct ions hearings. Attendances at court for such hearings frequently involve an amount of time trave lling to and from court and waiting at court which is quite significantly disproportionate to the amount of time actually spent in conducting the business. The overwhelming majority of these hearings could b e conducted with equivalent efficacy if participants never left their office or their home. Links can now be achieved by means of a telephone directions hearing. These have advantages of preser ving a degree of interactivity, without the use of special technology, other than in the central locat ion. The substantial expansion of Internet use make s available other forms including a chat room facilit y which enables several users to correspond with Page 3 of 4 Women Lawyers Association of NSW - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_25 ... each other in real time via their keyboards, or dis cussion groups or bulletin boards which operate lik e chat rooms but the participants are not involved at the same time, instead they post comments which others can later read and respond to, including the officer of the court who has to make the final decision. Where more direct contact is required, vi deo conferencing would be able to replicate in a virtual way the advantages of such contact. One of the difficulties with the widespread use of these technologies is that many will have the effec t of internalising to the Court, costs which are now borne by the parties. After just over one year as Chief Justice, I do not underestimate the inertia t hat can be caused by such a phenomenon. Although much heralded and not yet imminent, all of these technologies to which I have referred do open prospects of greater flexibility in both the w orkplace and in the conduct of the courts. This has been called the \"dematerialisation\" of the workplac e. There is a real possibility of the \"dematerialisation\" of some court processes into th eir electronic equivalents. I believe that women lawyers have a particular inte rest in these developments. * * * Page 4 of 4 Women Lawyers Association of NSW - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_25 ... Victory in the Pacific Official guests, men and women who served, ladies a nd gentlemen. We are gathered this morning at this solemn monumen t to commemorate the end of war in the Pacific 54 years ago. Of all the anniversaries we commemora te each year, including those marking the conclusion of past conflicts, this occasion has par ticular significance. The Pacific war was the first and only time in our history when the territorial integ rity of Australia was subject to direct immediate t hreat and when acts of war were carried out on Australian soil. This day, 54 years ago, marked the end of the Secon d World War, a conflict without precedent in recorded history. During that war, from a population of seven million people, almost one million men and women enlisted for service and a great many more supporte d the war effort directly in a civilian capacity. Almost forty thousand Australians gave their lives and countless thousands suffered physical or emotional wounds, during that terrible conflict. We assemble here to mark this anniversary, first an d foremost to remember and to honour those who served and those who suffered both in Australia and overseas. Above all, we gather here to pay tribute to , and to express our continuing gratitud e to, those who died. By this remembrance, repeated annually, we reinforc e our awareness as a community, that our democratic and free way of life is a precious inher itance which has been hard won through the commitment and sacrifice of those who served. As we reflect on the rigours and the horror of war and its impact on individuals and on families - of lives cut off, of hopes and aspirations destroyed - we engage in a process which must be undertaken so that our nation will do what it can to ensure th at such an occurrence will never happen again. As it was once put: \" Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it \". We must never allow it to be said that those who de fended our fundamental freedoms in the Second World War died in vain. What we commemorate today is the performance by mil lions of Australians of duties they owed to Australia as a nation and a society. I do not speak only of military duties, I speak of duties owed as citizens. The duty to defend the nation is the most fundamental of civic obligations. The example of those who served emphasises for all of us that the rights we enjoy must be earned. I belong to a fortunate generation which has not ha d to earn our rights in the same way as those whose service and sacrifice we commemorate today, h ad to do. But it is their example which should make each and every one of us ponder: Are we doing what we should in the performance of our civic obligations, so as to be able to say that we have e arned the rights we enjoy? We have a duty to the dead whom we honour today, an d who performed their obligations beyond measure, to be able to answer that question \"Yes\".

Red Cross Gala Dinner - 50th Anniversary of the Gen eva Conventions ADDRESS BY THE HONOURABLE J J SPIGELMAN CHIEF JUSTICE OF NEW SOUTH WALES IN THE GREAT HALL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY 12 AUGUST 1999 In the maelstrom of conflict over nationalism, reli gion and political ideology, there are very few creations of the human imagination which are univer sally regarded as unequivocally good. The Geneva Conventions, the 50th Anniversary of which w e commemorate today, fall in that tiny category. There can be no doubt that these Conventions have p layed a significant role in the alleviation of human suffering in the course of armed conflict. Th at is not to say, as those who have served the International Committee of the Red Cross are all to o well aware, that the provisions of the Conventions are always observed. Nevertheless their very existence and the mechanisms for enforcement, not least through the activities of th e Red Cross, have had universally positive effects by introducing some standards of civilised behaviour t o warfare. It is fitting that we commemorate such an achievement. As we look back over a period of 50 years, it is ap propriate to note that those who gathered in Geneva on 12 August 1949 to sign the Final Act of the Conf erence, and open for signature the four Conventions which were the product of the conferenc e, were looking back at developments over a period of 85 years. As members of this audience are well aware, it was the experience of the young Swiss, Henry Dunant of the aftermath of the Battle of Solferino that co mmenced this entire process. In June 1859 two armies of Austrian and Franco-Italian forces clashe d. By nightfall there were 6,000 dead and 36,000 wounded on the battlefield. No effort was made to g ather them until the following day and some of the wounded received no help for several days. Finally, 22,000 Austrian and 17,000 French soldiers lost their lives at Solferino. During the campaign 60% o f the wounded died. In the military campaigns of that era the number who were immediately killed usu ally amounted to a mere quarter of the total number who died. It was in the wake of this experience that Dunant w rote his book \"A Memory of Solferino\". He made a twofold proposal. First, that a volunteer relief so ciety be constituted and prepare itself in peacetim e to assist army medical services in the event of war. S econdly, that the Nations meet and adopt a Convention to provide a legal basis for the protect ion of military hospitals and medical personnel. Th e first proposal led to the creation of the Red Cross . The second led to the first Geneva Convention concerned with the Relief of the Wounded and Sick o f Armies in the Field. The Convention of 22 August 1864 was the foundation of contemporary international humanitarian law. From that time to this the further development of that law has proceeded in symbiotic relationshi p with the development of the functions and activitie s of the Red Cross. It is 135 years since the International Conference met in Geneva on 8 August 1864 which led to that first Geneva Convention of 22 August 1864. This first Convention contained only 10 Articles. T he four Conventions of 1949 contained a total of 48 6 Articles, including appendices. Over that period, s imilar explosion has occurred for the statutes with which I deal on a daily basis as a Judge. It is by no means clear that this constitutes progress. The original instrument of August 1864 was revised in 1906 and 1929, by Conventions respectively concluded at Geneva. However even the 1929 Conventi on proved deficient to deal with the practice of warfare during the Second World War. Accordingly th e Geneva Conference of 1949 adopted a new Print Page Close Window Page 1 of 3 Red Cross Gala Dinner - 50th Anniversary of the Geneva Conventions - Supreme Cou ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_12 ... Convention on the subject of military wounded. The second Convention of 1949 provided protection t o wounded and sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea. After an unsuccessful attem pt in 1868, the principles of the 1864 Convention with respect to armies in the field were adapted to maritime warfare in the Convention signed at the first Hague Conference of 1899. That was revised in 1907. Notwithstanding attempts to further amend these provisions in the light of the 1929 revisions to the original Convention, only drafts of the amendments existed prior to the Second World War. A new more elaborate Convention was adopted in 1949. The third Convention of 1949 was concerned with pro tection of prisoners of war. The humanitarian impulse had led to the Hague Regulations following the Hague Convention of 1907. The experience of World War I led to the adoption of a detailed code of provisions in a Convention adopted by the conference in Geneva in 1929. Changes in the struct ure and process of modern warfare reflected in the Second World War led to the revision in the thi rd Convention of 1949. The nature of progress in the area can be readily s een from this history. The process extended humanitarian principles, from time to time, to new categories of victims of war. The development of modern warfare and the particular horrors of the Se cond World War had established beyond question the need for humanitarian protection of civilians. The fourth Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is the most novel o f the four Conventions, the Anniversary of which we commemorate today. Preparatory work had gone on for some time particul arly in the form of a draft Convention at the 15th International Red Cross Conference held in Tokyo in 1934. This, together with drafts of amendments to the other Conventions had been placed on the age nda of a Diplomatic Conference called by the Swiss Government for the beginning of 1940. The out break of war led to the abandonment of this event. Its progress had to await the Conference hel d in Geneva between 21 April and 12 August 1949. Proposals that the 1949 Conventions would lead to a composite Convention for the Protection of the Victims of War did not eventuate. However the commo nality of the four Conventions that were adopted at that time is reflected in the fact that they have certain common Articles. One of the common Articles extends Convention rules not only t o declared wars but to \"any other armed conflict\". Another establishes the applicability of a minimum of humane treatment for \"armed conflict not of an international character\". However, in 1949 States w ere not prepared to allow international law to intrude upon their own sovereignty. Accordingly breaches of the moral principles in the case of domestic armed conflict were not subject to international enforcement. The regime focused on \"grave breaches\" from which these internal State conflicts were exempt. Nevertheless, common Article 3 represented a significant declaration of humanitarian principle applicable even to civil war s. It is in the area of enforcement of international h umanitarian law that hopeful signs have recently emerged. The occasions for international co-operati on have expanded since the conclusion of the Cold War. For the first time since the Nuremberg Trials and t he Tokyo Trials in the immediate wake of the Second World War, the international community has c reated an international enforcement process. First, in 1993, by resolution of the Security Counc il there was established the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Then, in 1994, also by resolution of the Security Council there was created the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda following the mass murders of that Nation's civil war. The test case for this new tribunal system involved Dusko Tadic, a Serb nationalist from Bosnia- Herzegovina who was eventually sentenced to 20 year s imprisonment for his involvement in the brutalities of ethnic cleansing amongst his Muslim neighbours. One of the judges in the initial hearings was our o wn Sir Ninian Stephen. Page 2 of 3 Red Cross Gala Dinner - 50th Anniversary of the Geneva Conventions - Supreme Cou ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_12 ... The Tribunal was limited in its application of the 1949 Geneva Conventions which, in their terms apply sanctions only for the particular list of allegatio ns described as \"grave breaches\" which, relevantly, are confined to \"armed conflicts\" which are \"internatio nal\". Accordingly, a number of alleged breaches of these conventions were dismissed on the basis that Tadic's conduct occurred during a civil war. The Tribunal was convinced that the Bosnian Serb forces were allies not agents of an international power, namely Milosevic's Serbia. On that basis there was no \"international conflict\". The prosecution appealed. A month ago, on 15 July this year, the Ap peals Chamber allowed the appeal and found Tadic guilty of \"grave breaches\" of the Geneva Conv entions for his treatment of civilians. On 17 July 1998 there occurred in Rome, an event of great international potential. 120 Nations voted to adopt a statute creating an International Crimin al Court. This is not the occasion to delve into th e detail of difficulties of interpretation and the co mpromises involved in developing an international regime of this character. Nor to speculate on the o utcome of a process which has just commenced. It is sufficient to acclaim the result of a project th at has been on the minds of jurists for over a cent ury and actively pursued on the UN agenda for the last 10 years. It is likely that there will now be a permanent Int ernational Criminal Court. Criticism of the Nurembu rg trials by reason of the element of retrospectivity will no longer be valid. The process of resolving t he conflicting claims of the rule of law and the sover eign independence of Nations will be a continuing one. Many issues of jurisdiction and procedure rema in to be resolved. Nevertheless, there is reason to welcome the real progress made in the application o f legal principles to control crimes against humanity and war crimes. A particularly dramatic example of the change in th e international environment in this regard occurred on 24 March 1999. On that day the House of Lords ru led that the Torture Convention, to which the United Kingdom was a party, had taken away from Gen eral Pinochet the sovereign immunity from prosecution which he had enjoyed as a Head of State . Accordingly he faces the prospect of extradition to Spain. On that same day NATO commenced its bombi ng campaign against the sovereign state of Yugoslavia in response to the Serbian atrocities in the province of Kosovo. A primary motivation for that intervention was humanitarian. Kosovo has no o il. Although the decision of the House of Lords was a legal remedy, the intervention in Kosovo indi cates the limitation on legal remedies. Marcus Tullius Cicero said 2,000 years ago: \"In the midst of arms, law stands mute.\" The Geneva Conventions of 1949, the 50th Anniversary of which we commemorate today, constitute one of the most significant landmarks on the road that has bee n taken to render this dictum wrong. * * * Page 3 of 3 Red Cross Gala Dinner - 50th Anniversary of the Geneva Conventions - Supreme Cou ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_12 ... The Medico-Legal Society of New South Wales Annual General Meeting The Honourable JJ Spigelman Chief Justice of New South Wales 6 August 1999 The theme I wish to develop with you this evening i s the common bond that medicine and law have as professions, in the light of contemporary challenge s to the role of, perhaps the very concept of, a profession. Some of you may have attended the Legal and Medical Conference earlier this year at which Chief Justice Gleeson spoke on the subject \"A re the Professions worth Keeping?\". His Honour concluded: \"The idea of professionalism is as important now as it ever was ... The status of a profession should not be a badge of exclusivity. Ra ther, it should be seen as an acceptance of responsibility, and encouraged. Provi ded they understand the reason for their existence, and accept that the public interes t is the ultimate test of the legitimacy of their practices, the professions are more necessary than ever, and well worth keeping.\" I commend his Honour's speech to those of you who m ay wish to pursue the matter further. This evening I wish merely to highlight one or two aspec ts of the themes developed more fully in that paper . His Honour began with the pressures, common to both the legal and medical professions, which seem to drive practitioners in the direction of treating their activities as merely a business. The use of commercial criteria as an exclusive measure of valu e is perhaps the most distinctive feature of this, aptly called, American century. Commercialism is th e most prominent phenomenon of that nation's culture - I use the term in its widest sense. The application of commercial values to everything - the concept that everything is for sale - is most dramatically manifest in the physical structure of our cities. In the immediately preceding centuries the dominant buildings in any urban area were public bu ildings: a parliament house, a town hall, a cathedral. Today all these buildings are dwarfed by commercial office blocks. Increasingly public functions are performed in such towers distinguisha ble, if at all, only by their banality. It is inevitable that forces of such strength will impinge on all traditional modes of behaviour, incl uding that of the professions. They do so in many differe nt ways. The pressure of judging everything by economic values is one that ought be resisted. Econ omic criteria are of course relevant. They do not however constitute the only values which we profess as a society. In the case of the medical profession, the healing of the individual body or mind has value irrespecti ve of its economic consequences. So for the legal prof ession, truth, justice and fairness are matters whi ch demand primary consideration. I am reminded in this respect of the ardent micro-e conomic reformer who noticed that a string quartet performs a work by Mozart in exactly the same time in 1999 as it was performed in 1799. In short there had been no increase in productivity for 200 years. This reformer, sure that a great scandal had been discovered, in the form of a collusive arrangement amongst professional musicians, referred the matter to the competition regulator. Some commentary on th e legal system discloses a similar approach to life. So does some commentary on medical practice. Some things take time. Justice is one of them. Healing is another. The pressure of commercialisation has substantial i mpetus in both professions - not least the impetus of greed. However, that sin is now validated in a r egulatory culture which assumes that \"greed is good \". Both the medical and legal professions are being dr iven in a direction which emphasises the significance of economic factors, particularly by t heir joint subjection to the co-operative scheme of the Commonwealth and State Governments reflected in the Competition Principles Agreement. The regulation of each profession is now subject to a p rimary criterion of competition policy. What was hitherto regarded as the primary aspect of the rela tionship between the professional and his client or patient - namely a personal bond, created in a cont ext of a high degree of personal responsibility - i s apparently to be replaced by a primary bond of impe rsonal market forces. Print Page Close Window Page 1 of 4 The Medico -Legal Society of New South Wales Annual General Mee ting - Supreme ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_06 ... There can be no doubt that competition operates in the public interest and that many past aspects of professional practice could not be justified as bei ng in the public interest. Too much of professional self-regulation was exposed to be purely protection ist. Nevertheless, there is an element of monomania about the application of competition policy to the professions, which renders it suspect. I acknowledge, as Chief Justice Gleeson acknowledge d in the speech to which I have referred, that increased competition amongst professionals is a go od thing, that it can serve the public interest and that many of the changes that have been introduced under the spur of competition policy have been positive. There are however limits to the efficacy of this approach which are not always recognised. One of the primary difficulties in the provision of legal services concerns the frequency with which t here appears to be no rational or reasonable proportiona lity between the costs of legal services and the value of what is involved. A similar issue arises w ith respect to the problem of overservicing in the context of medical practice. There are limits to th e ability of a market based approach to control suc h matters. As Chief Justice Gleeson noted in his speech: \"Consumers of professional services are often not w ell placed to decide for themselves the extent of their need for services. Consider, fo r example, in the area of medical practice, the matter of diagnostic services. How is competition likely to prevent over servicing? How can patients, as consumers, make a j udgment as to their need for diagnostic services? In the area of legal practice ... even the most sophisticated client is likely to be at a disadvantage in making a judgment about the reasonableness of the time spent by the solicitor on various aspects of the ca se.\" Economists would call this \"market failure\". Let me pursue this perspective of micro-economics. In a market for medical or legal services in which knowl edge were perfect, clients or patients would ensure that the costs of litigation or medical service wou ld be minimised and that the costs would be reasonably proportionate to the value to them of th e legal service or the medical procedure. How is a litigant to know whether the time and effort expend ed on discovery was necessary? Or whether the often substantial photocopying bill had to be incur red? All of this is exacerbated by the in-built con flict associated with the ubiquity of time based charging and the tyranny of billable hours. The inadequacy of information available to clients and patients ab out the relevant legal or medical knowledge and abo ut the skills of their lawyers or doctors, prevent the m exercising control over the market for these serv ices in this way. Although many steps can be, and are being, taken to improve consumer information, there are limits to what can be done. For this reasons professional sta ndards have a role to play which cannot be performed by market place competition. As Chief Jus tice Gleeson said: \"The constraint upon the pursuit of self-interest w hich is an essential aspect of professionalism also provides a necessary form of p rotection for consumers of services.\" The proposition was well put by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in the Supreme Court in the United States when her Honour said: \"One distinguishing feature of any profession, unli ke other occupations that may be equally respectable, is that membership entails an ethical obligation to temper one's selfish pursuit of economic success by adhering to standards of conduct that could not be enforced either by legal fiat or through the discip line of the market. There are sound reasons to continue pursuing the goal that is impli cit in the traditional view of professional life. Both special privileges incident to membershi p in the profession and the advantages those privileges give in the necessary task of earn ing a living are means to a goal that transcends the accumulation of wealth. That goal is public service, which in the legal profession can take a variety of familiar forms. Th is view of the legal profession need not be rooted in romanticism or self-serving sanctimony , though of course it can be. Rather, special ethical standards for lawyers are properly understood as an appropriate means of Page 2 of 4 The Medico -Legal Society of New South Wales Annual General Mee ting - Supreme ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_06 ... restraining lawyers in the exercise of the unique p ower that they inevitable wield in a political system like ours ... Precisely because lawy ers must be provided with expertise that is both esoteric and extremely powerful, it wo uld be unrealistic to demand that clients bargain for their services in the same arms length manner that may be appropriate when buying an automobile or choosing a dry cleaner. Lik e physicians, lawyers are subject to heightened ethical demands on their conduct towards those they serve. These demands are needed because market forces, and the ordinary legal prohibitions against force and fraud, are simply insufficient to protect the consumers of their necessary services from the peculiar power of the s pecialised knowledge that these professionals possess.\" (See Shapero v Kentucky Bar Association (1988) 486 US 466.) One of the important restraints on professional con duct to which her Honour went on to make reference was the restriction on advertising and so licitation which she described: \"... as a concrete, day-to-day reminder to the practi sing attorney of why it is improper for any member of this profession to regard it as a tra de or occupation like any other.\" Her Honour went on to qualify these remarks by indi cating that some degree of advertising was appropriate and would provide the advantages of com petition. Nevertheless there are indications in the United States legal profession, though not yet in t he Australian legal profession, that the removal of restraints on advertising fails to serve the public interest. There is some suggestion that the medical professio n, even in Australia, has already suffered from the removal of restrictions on advertising particularly in such areas as treatment for bladder problems, impotence, anxiety, penile enlargement, cosmetic su rgery, tattoo removal and laser treatment. The pressures from national competition policies ha ve required medical regulatory authorities to lift restrictions on advertising services, which medical entrepreneurs who are profit driven and dependant on high turnover, may have been taken too far. There is no evidence that the regulation of truth i n advertising is conducted more effectively by the general law, through bodies such as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, than it would have been through restraint by professional r egulation. We have yet to see whether sufficient resources will be available to prevent the occurren ce of the kinds of abuses that sometimes attend promotional conduct, abuses which did not occur whe n advertising was regulated by professional standards. The common law has seen off earlier waves of monoma nia. In the past it came in the guise of religion - once as the divine right of kings. The secular reli gion of commercialism has had many victories in recent years. Nevertheless, it is incumbent on thos e of us who represent other values to emphasise the significance of what may be lost through such monom ania. In the context of the legal profession it is import ant that we emphasise the duties which legal practitioners have to the Court such as the duty no t to mislead the court; the duty not to commence or pursue proceedings which do not have reasonable pro spects of success; the duty not to assist any form of improper conduct; the duty to conduct cases efficiently and expeditiously; the duty to refrain from making allegations of impropriety against any person, without due cause. These duties apply irrespective of the wishes or interests of a client or, indeed, his or her enthusiasms and, accordingl y, they apply irrespective of the indirect financial i nterest of the practitioner, based on the interests of wishes of the client. By emphasising the ethic of service, professions in dicate that their basic organising principle is not merely one of commercialism. A diversity of organis ing principles is as important to the health of our society as bio-diversity is to our ecology. In main taining such diversity, the medical and legal professions can and should play a leadership role. They can do so only by reaffirming the traditional values of professionalism, particularly the ethic o f service - honesty, fidelity and diligence - above self interest, specifically commercial advantage. As Proust once said about professions: \"Just as those who practise the same profession rec ognise each other instinctively, so do those who practise the same vice.\" Page 3 of 4 The Medico -Legal Society of New South Wales Annual General Mee ting - Supreme ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_06 ... That comment does not only contain an analogy. It a lso contains a distinction, which it is important t o maintain. We can do so by recognising the force of the commercial imperative and, whilst abjuring nostalgia, rearticulating the value of the traditio ns we jointly and severally inherit. Page 4 of 4 The Medico -Legal Society of New South Wales Annual General Mee ting - Supreme ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_06 ... Sentencing Guidelines Judgments Address to the National Conference of District and County Court Judges The Honourable JJ Spigelman Chief Justice of New South Wales 24 June 1999 The New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal has es tablished a formal system of guideline judgments ( Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 ; Henry (1999) NSWCCA 111 ). This represents a significant development in this State with respect to the exerc ise of discretion by sentencing judges, a context which is, perhaps, the most controversial single ar ea of judicial decision-making. The new system of guideline judgments has been well received by the public. It has also been well received in legal commentary[1]. It is not a univer sal rule of human behaviour that persons who have a discretion invariably welcome what may be regarded as confining their exercise of it. However, insofar as I have received commentary from trial judges tha t has also been supportive. It may be that this is on the Mandy Rice Davies principle - \"They would sa y that, wouldn't they\". The guideline judgments system has emerged in a con text in which there has been a significant public debate about the introduction of various forms of l egislative prescription which would significantly confine the exercise of sentencing discretion. This includes the introduction of minimum sentences or of a detailed matrix or grid for sentencing. The introduction of legislation of this character i n Western Australia last year, led to the preparati on of a condemnatory report by the Chief Justice of Weste rn Australia, with what was described as \"the express and unanimous support and concurrence of th e judges of the Supreme Court and of the District Court\", although in one particular respect , on behalf of the judges of the Supreme Court only . This report was tabled in Parliament pursuant to th e provisions of s144(1) of the Sentencing Act 1995 (WA) [2]. The report condemned the proposals as imposin g an unreasonable fetter on the sentencing discretion. We have been here before. I am indebted to his Hono ur Judge Greg Woods QC, of the District Court of NSW, who has drawn my attention to the Criminal Law Amendment Act (NSW) of 1883. That Act of the New South Wales Parliament created a sentencing structure with five distinct steps or categories, with both minimum and maximum sentences. That schem e led to palpable injustices so that, with respect to one case, the Sydney Morning Herald edit orialised on 27 September 1883: \"We have the fact before us that in a case where a light penalty would have satisfied the claims of justice, the judge was prevented from doi ng what he believed to be right, and was compelled to pass a sentence which he believed to be excessive, and therefore unjust, because the rigidity of the law left him no discretion.\" After such inequities were clearly established, the scheme was abandoned by statute a year after its introduction. Today's Northern Territorians are mad e of sterner stuff. Consideration has been given to an argument that th ere exist constitutional limitations on the ability of a State Parliament to imposing minimum penalties or a sentencing grid system [3]. This argument is based on an application of the reasoning of the Hig h Court in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions [4] which recognised restrictions on the ability of the State Parliaments to require the State Courts to operate in a way which would be incompatible with t heir role under the Constitution of the Commonwealth, as repositories of federal judicial p ower. However, it is clear that a State Parliament may im pose on its Courts any regime which the Commonwealth could impose on Commonwealth courts, c onsistently with the requirements of Chapter III of the Constitution [5]. There is clear authority in the High Court tha t the Commonwealth Print Page Close Window Page 1 of 9 Sentencing Guidelines Judgments - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_24 ... can prescribe a minimum penalty for a Commonwealth offence[6]. The argument has not been successful in a challenge to the minimum sentencing legislation of the Northern Territory[7]. Similar constitutional arguments have proven unsuccessful i n other jurisdictions[8]. Discretion As I emphasised in my judgments in Jurisic and Henry , guideline judgments are a mechanism for structuring discretion, not for restricting discret ion. The continued existence of sentencing discreti on is an essential component of the fairness of our crimi nal justice system. Unless judges are able to mould the sentence to the circumstances of the individual case then, irrespective of how much legislative forethought ha s gone into the determination of a particular regime, there will always be the prospect of injust ice. No judge of my acquaintance is prepared to tolerate becoming an instrument of injustice. Guide line judgments are preferable to the constraints of mandatory minimum terms or grid sentencing. The ineluctable core of the sentencing task is a pr ocess of balancing overlapping, contradictory and incommensurable objectives. The requirements of det errence, rehabilitation, denunciation, punishment and restorative justice - do not general ly point in the same direction. Specifically, the requirements of justice, in the sense of just deser ts, and of mercy, often conflict. Yet we live in a society which values both justice and mercy. Centuries of practical experience establish that th e multiplicity of factors involved in the sentencin g task require the exercise of a broad discretion, wh ich is best conferred on trial judges. That is why the promulgation of guidelines must not be inconsistent with the existence of a sentencing discretion. We must strive for both consistency and individualised justice. Sentencing guidelines as promulgated by the NSW Cou rt of Criminal Appeal are not binding in a formal sense. They are not precedents that must be followed. They represent a relevant indicator for the sentencing judge. They are not intended to be a pplied to every case as if they were binding rules. The sentencing judge retains his or her discretion both within the guidelines as expressed, but also the discretion to depart from them if the particula r circumstances of the case justify such departure[ 9]. The appropriateness of an appellate court establish ing guidelines has been authoritatively established in Norbis v Norbis [10], in which the High Court held that the promul gation by the Full Court of the Family Court of guidelines with respect to the exer cise of statutory discretions by trial judges was justified. I have summarised this line of authority in my judgment in Henry [11]. Justices Mason and Deane, in a joint judgment in Norbis , gave compelling reasons for the appropriateness of guidelines: \"... it does not follow that, because a discretion is expressed in general terms, Parliament intended that the court should refrain f rom developing rules or guidelines affecting its exercise. One very significant strand in the development of the law has been the judicial transformation of discretionary remedi es into remedies which are granted or refused according to well settled principle. It has been a development which has promoted consistency in decision-making and diminis hed the risks of arbitrary and capricious adjudication. .......... The point of preserving the width of the discretion which parliament has created is that it maximises the possibility of doing justice in every case. But the need for consistency in judicial adjudication, which is the antithesis of arbitrary and capricious decision-making, provides an important countervailing consideration supporting the giving of guidance by appellate courts, whether in the for m of principles or guidelines ... To avoid the risk o f inconsistency and arbitrariness which is inherent in the system of relief involving a complex of discret ionary assessments and judgments, the Full Court, as a specialist appellate court with the unique exp erience in family law in this country, should give guidance as to the manner in which these assessment s and judgments are to be made. Yet guidance must be given in a way that preserves, so far as it is possible to do so, the capacity of the Family Court to do justice according to the needs of the i ndividual case, whatever its complications may be.\"[12] Page 2 of 9 Sentencing Guidelines Judgments - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_24 ... This reasoning is equally applicable to the exercis e of the sentencing discretion. There was a suggestion in the judgment of Justices Mason and Deane in Norbis that there may be circumstances in which it was appropriate for an ap pellate court to lay down a guideline, even with respect to a statutory discretion, which was in the nature of a binding rule of law. On that basis, fa ilure to apply the guideline could itself constitute a le gal error, which would justify an appellate court interfering with the exercise of the discretion. Fo r the reasons I gave in my judgment in Henry , I am of the view that the balance of authority strongly ind icates that this is no so[13]. The decision in Henry establishes for New South Wales, that failure to s entence in accordance with a guideline is not itself a ground of appeal. Neverth eless, where a guideline is not to be applied by a trial judge, the appellate court expects that the reasons for that decision be articulated[14]. Consistency Just as the sentencing task involves the weighing o f incommensurable and sometimes contradictory objectives, so the appellate task involves balancin g the objectives of individualisation of a sentence against the requirement of consistency. Perhaps mor e than any other factor, it is the need for consistency in judicial decision-making which justi fies appellate courts laying down guidelines for th e exercise of discretion by trial judges. The cases i n the various areas of the law which approve guidelines, referred to in Henry [15], refer to this factor. Allegations of inconsistency are not always well in formed[16]. Nevertheless inconsistency in sentencing can and does occur. By inconsistency I d o not mean only that individual judges have different penal philosophies. This is not a bad thi ng in a field in which, as Sir Frederick Jordan onc e put it: \"The only golden rule is that there is no g olden rule\"[17]. In this regard, judges reflect the wide range of differing views on this very matter that e xists in the general community. However, there are limits to the permissible range of variation. There is one significant impediment to the ability of our traditional system of appeals achieving the objective of consistency. Our system of appeals ope rates in a distinctly different way with respect to appeals against severity, from the way it operates with respect to Crown appeals against leniency. Wherever a trial judge sentences in a manner that c an be described as inconsistent with that of other trial judges by being too harsh, the appellate cour t will correct the error without any restraint on i ts doing so. In the case of Crown appeals however, the re are significant restraints which do not operate in the case of severity appeals[18]. Crown appeals are said to be comparatively infreque nt, though perhaps less so now than hitherto. There remain significant, and entirely appropriate, inhibitions on Crown law officers initiating appea ls at all. If they are lodged, appellate courts approa ch such appeals with the application of the princip le of double jeopardy. There are hurdles which the Cro wn has to overcome, before the court will interfere with an exercise of discretion that is said to be t oo lenient, which do not need to be overcome in the case of interference with the exercise of discretio n said to be too harsh. In this context, it becomes even more important than usual, that we do what we can to minimise the need for appeals. Guideline judgments may assist in this regard. No-one doubts the significance of consistency in de cision-making in this very difficult and sensitive area. That significance was well expressed by Sir A nthony Mason, when his Honour said: \"Just as consistency in punishment - a reflection o f the notion of equal justice - is a fundamental element in any rational and fair system of criminal justice, so inconsistency in punishment, because it is regarded as a badge of unfairness and unequal treatment under the law, is calculated to lead to an erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice.\"[19] Consistency in sentencing does not simply impinge o n the criminal justice system. By reason of the public prominence of the issues that arise, consist ency in sentencing serves a high constitutional purpose: the maintenance of the rule of law. Leniency Issues of inconsistency in sentencing must be disti nguished from allegations of systematic excessive leniency. Plainly where such is established, it may call for a sentencing guideline of the character I Page 3 of 9 Sentencing Guidelines Judgments - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_24 ... have identified. The Court of Criminal Appeal did d etect a pattern of leniency in both Jurisic[20], wi th respect to the offence of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm or death and in Henry [21], with respect to the offence of armed robbery. In Jurisic the Court referred to a long list of inv ariably successful Crown appeals for the relevant offence. It appeared to the Court that the Parliame ntary intention reflected in significantly increase d maximum penalties, which the Court of Criminal Appe al had said a number of times should lead to a \"sharp upward\" movement in sentences, had simply no t been implemented. In Henry , the statistics indicated that non-custodial sente nces for armed robbery were common. This contrasted with a long line of appellate authority which stated that such sentences should be rare. Nevertheless, on other aspects of sentencing for ar med robbery trial judges would have found it difficult to reconcile decisions of the Court of Cr iminal Appeal. One of the functions of a guideline judgment, as shown in Henry , is to prevent inconsistency at an appellate level also. Justice Wood, Chief Judge at Common Law, said in an address to the Annual Conference of the District Court of NSW in April, that one reason for promulgating a guideline judgment is: \"it becoming apparent that sentencing judges are me rely paying lip-service to pronouncements by the Court of Criminal Appeal as t o sentencing policy in a particular area of criminality, and are possibly relying on: t he reluctance of the Crown to appeal against sentence; or upon the discretion traditiona lly exercised by the Court of Criminal Appeal in declining to interfere in such matters; o r upon the double jeopardy principle, in those cases where it does intervene; to produce a l ess severe sentence than that properly called for.\"[22] Where it becomes apparent to a Court of Criminal Ap peal that a particular judge is behaving in this way, it is open to the appellate Court to approach that judge's sentences without the usual inhibition s on intervening with the exercise of discretion and to suspend the double jeopardy principle in such a case. A guideline judgment system appears to me to be preferable to such a course. The sine qua non of the ability of the Court of Cri minal Appeal in New South Wales to assess sentencing practice for the purpose of determining the need for a guideline judgment is the systematic collection of sentencing statistics by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales of a comprehensiveness that is not readily available in all Australian states. In 1989, the Australian Bure au of Statistics ceased publishing detailed sentencing statistics for higher courts in Australia. Since t hat time, sources of information have not been adequate in some States. I am aware that the judiciary in those States has been urging the collection of such statistics. I confirm that the absence of such comprehensive information makes it extremely diffic ult to ensure consistency in sentencing practice. A system of guideline judgments would be virtually im possible. I do not need to tell this audience that allegation s of systematic leniency in sentencing decisions, which so frequently appear in the media, is often n ot well informed criticism. That is not to say that there are not occasions when public criticism of sp ecific sentences for leniency is justified. There a re such examples and, for the reasons I have mentioned , they are not always able to be cured by appellate courts. Part of the role of sentencing guidelines is to rei nforce public confidence in the administration of justice. Indeed the experience in New South Wales i s that the very announcement of a system of sentencing guidelines by the Court of Criminal Appe al has, of itself, had an announcement affect on public perception on questions of both leniency and inconsistency, in such a way as to enhance public confidence in the criminal justice system. One of the tasks that courts, and others responsibl e for the administration of the criminal justice system, must undertake is public education of what sentencing practices actually are. There is no doubt that the occasional inadequate sentence recei ves much more significant public exposure through the media than the continuing, day in and d ay out, imposition of sentences that are generally regarded as correct and, therefore, pass without co mment. Research throughout the western world has indicated that there is a widely held belief that sentences actually imposed are not commensurate with the seri ousness of the crimes for which they are imposed[23]. However, there are now numerous studie s which show that the public opinion expressed Page 4 of 9 Sentencing Guidelines Judgments - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_24 ... in polls, through the media and talk back radio and various other expressions of public opinion, are often ill informed. The belief that there exists a significant disparity of a systematic character bet ween actual sentencing practice and what the public see as appropriate sentences, is wrong. More detailed and sophisticated methods of gauging popular opinio n suggest that when the full facts of particular cases are explained, the public tends, to a very su bstantial degree, to support the sentences actually imposed or, at least, to express the opinion that t hey are lenient to a significantly lesser extent th an answers to general, undirected questions would sugg est. This is true of research in the United States[24], in the United Kingdom[25] and in Canada[26]. These studies have been replicated in Australia with gene rally similar results[27]. A good example of such research was conducted by th e Royal Commission on Criminal Justice in the United Kingdom, which asked 2,300 jurors what they thought about the sentence passed in the case in which they served. About a third said they had n o expectation. Almost a third said that the sentenc e was as they had expected. The remaining one third w as divided between those who thought it was more severe than they expected (14%) and those who regarded it as less severe (23%)[28]. This discrepancy between public perception and the reality of sentencing practice exists. The public interest would be served by minimising that discrep ancy. The public response to the system of guideline judgments in New South Wales, suggests th at such judgments may help to bring public perception into line with actual practice. Deterrence Another function performed by the promulgation of g uidelines is that of deterrence. The public at larg e and potential offenders in particular, should know in advance that offences of a particular kind are likely to lead to a particular level of sentence. T his is often said to be an advantage of a minimum sentence regime or of grid sentencing. It is appare nt that the publication of maximum sentences does not perform a substantial deterrent function, as th e relationship between maximum sentences and actual sentences is not sufficiently clear. There is a considerable debate about the deterrent effect of sentences and, particularly, of marginal increases in sentences. That penalties operate as a deterrent is a structural phenomenon of our criminal justice system. For reasons I analysed in Henry [29], the courts must continue to act on the basis that punishment deters and that, within limit s of tolerance, increased punishment has a corresponding effect by way of deterrence. This is a structural feature of the common law, in its application to criminal justice. Legislation would be required to change the traditional approach to t his matter. However, deterrence only works to the extent to whi ch knowledge is transmitted to potential offenders about actual sentencing practice. Guideline judgmen ts are a mechanism of increasing the efficiency of the transmission of such knowledge. Guideline Judgments Guideline cases are judgments that go beyond the po int raised in the particular case to suggest a sentencing scale, or appropriate starting point, in one or more commonly encountered factual situations. As I emphasised in my judgment in Jurisic, the stat ement of guidelines in a quantitative form is a development of what appellate courts have long done by way of statement of sentencing principles. I set out in Jurisic the range of cases in which the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal had previously indicated circumstances in which a custo dial sentence would usually be appropriate and cases in which the court had stressed that the leng th of imprisonment should be substantial[30]. However, the laying down of guidelines and sentenci ng principles in the traditional manner, does run the risk that the guidelines will be overlooked. As the Honourable Justice Wood, Chief Judge at Comm on Law said in Jurisic : \"The court has...over the years endeavoured to lay down sentencing principles for particular classes of cases where sentences reflect ing a significant element of general deterrence are required, or where non-custodial opt ions are inappropriate. It appears that sometimes these principles are lost or that th eir significance is overlooked, in the volume of appellate decisions handed down and in th e pressures imposed on trial courts to dispose of the increasingly busy criminal lists. \"[31] Page 5 of 9 Sentencing Guidelines Judgments - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP \"guideli ne judgments\" will reduce the possibility of oversight. Two kinds of systems of guideline judgments have em erged in different jurisdictions. The first is a system in which the appellate court establishes a g uideline of a prescriptive character. The second, i s a system in which the appellate court purports to d erive a range or \"tariff\" from the actual sentences of trial judges. The former, I have called 'top-down' sentencing guidelines, and the latter, 'bottom-up' sentencing guidelines. The most well developed system of guideline judgmen ts is in England, where the system was initiated in the 1970's by the English Court of Appeal (Crimi nal Division) under Lord Justice Lawton and further developed by Lord Chief Justice Lane. The usual Eng lish guideline judgment does two things: First, it sets a tariff or sentencing range for a particular offence and, secondly, it differentiates between, a nd analyses, aggravating and mitigating factors in rel ation to a particular type of offence. Guidelines h ave been for particular offences[32], or for type of pe nalty[33], or for the type of offender[34]. Sometim es, a quantitative measure is not appropriate because of wide variations in the circumstances of an offence e.g. burglary or manslaughter[35]. In such cases th e guidance is in the form of consideration of aggravating and mitigating factors. In Canada, the courts have developed, in certain sp ecific cases, a prescriptive approach to guidelines . The Supreme Court of Canada has affirmed the approp riateness for a criminal appellate court to lay down guidelines in the nature of a starting point f or sentencing of a particular offence[36]. The majo rity judgment was delivered by McLachlin J. Her Ladyship said: \"The traditional notion that sentencing is primaril y a matter of impression for the sentencing judge and only secondarily a matter of p rinciple, began to be questioned by the Courts in the mid 60's. Behind the challenge la y increasing recognition that some measure of uniformity was essential in a sentencing process that was not only just, but was seen to be just.\"[37] In New Zealand, sentencing guidelines are of the bo ttom-up variety i.e. a synthesis of pre-existing fi rst instance sentences, rather than a guideline as to w hat is appropriate[38]. In Australia, the Supreme Court of South Australia has promulgated sentencing standards, in particular cases, which are recognisably prescripti ve i.e. of a top-down character[39]. In Western Australia, the Court of Criminal Appeal has provided sentencing guidelines in a 'bottom-up' fashion derived from sentences actually imposed by trial judges[40]. Henry summarised the guidelines that had been devel oped in all these jurisdictions, and some other jurisdictions, for the offence of armed robbery. Al though differences in remissions sometimes make comparisons difficult, it proved a most instructive review for the formulation of a guideline for New South Wales with respect to that offence. A Legislative Scheme By way of reaction to Jurisic , the New South Wales Parliament inserted a new Par t 8 into the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 . This part provides for the Attorney General to ap ply to the court to give a guideline judgment. Subsection s26(2) specifies tha t: \"An application may be made with respect to sentenc ing of persons found guilty of a particular specified indictable offence or category of indictable offences and may include submissions with respect to the framing of the guid eline.\" Such applications would not extend to requesting gu idelines for types of offender or types of penalty, as the English Court of Appeal has done on occasion . The legislation expressly envisages the continuatio n by the Court of the formulation of guideline judgments without any form of application by the At torney General (ss 26(4 ), 28(a) ). The Court is not obliged to issue any guideline, even after applicat ion, unless it believes it appropriate to do so ( s28 Page 6 of 9 Sentencing Guidelines Judgments - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_24 ... (b) ). During the course of the campaign for the recent St ate election, the Government, as part of its platform, undertook to apply to the Court of Crimin al Appeal for guideline judgments in the following cases: \"Break enter and steal, home invasion, drug importation, child sexual assault, sexual assault and high range drink driving offences\". With respect to all but one of these matters, cases involving either severity or Crown appeals against sentence are regularly before the Court of Criminal Appeal. It is my intention, if feasible, to list a ny application made under s26 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 , together with actual cases involving real factual situations. One of the matters with respect to which the govern ment has indicated it will apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal is \"high range drink driving\" offen ces. These are not appeals that come to the Court of Criminal Appeal. They are heard in the District Court. Special arrangements for informing the Court will need to be made with respect to this applicati on, if it is received. In the normal course, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions would apply for a guideline with respect to Commonwealth offences. One of the m atters which the New South Wales Government indicated it would refer to the Court of Criminal A ppeal under s26 of the Criminal Procedure Act, is t he offence of drug importation. That is a Commonwealth matter. It may be that this application, if and when received, will raise a Constitutional question . In any event special consideration will arise in de ciding on the feasibility of a guideline judgments system for Commonwealth offences. Section 16A of th e Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) , formulates a principle of general application and a list of factors requir ed to be taken into account on the sentencing task. The application of the reasoning in Norbis may aris e directly. In the future it may very well prove to be the case that applications for guideline judgments come fro m the defence side of the record. In New South Wales this is feasible because of the existence of a Public Defender, although it is a function that can be performed also by the Legal Aid Commission. The capacity of the Public Defender is acknowledged in s26 of the Criminal Procedure Act . English guideline judgments have encompassed the id entification of situations in which custodial sentences should not be regarded as appropriate. Gu ideline judgments do not operate in one direction only. The pressures of an ever increasing prison po pulation may well justify a systematic consideration of the need for custodial sentences f or a range of offences, as has happened in England. The experience of the Court in Henry, involving the consideration of seven separate cases for the offence of armed robbery, being six Crown appeals a nd one severity appeal, was particularly gratifying. The interaction between the Court and t he range of counsel, for the Crown and those representing offenders in a significant number of d ifferent factual situations, proved to be particula rly successful in the conduct of the policy inquiry req uired for formulation of guidelines. The system of guideline judgments enabled all relevant parties to approach preparation with a degree of comprehensiveness that would usually be difficult t o justify. The quality of the materials presented t o the Court, and of the oral argument, was very high. It is reasonably clear that in the near future, the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales will devote considerable effort and energy to determinin g whether or not guideline judgments are appropriate in a number of different spheres of sen tencing. As I said in Jurisic [41], such guidelines should be recognised as having a useful role to pla y in maintaining an appropriate balance between the broad discretion that must be retained to ensur e that justice is done in each individual case, on the one hand, and the need for consistency in sentencin g and the promotion of public confidence in the administration of justice, on the other hand.

Magistrates' Institute of NSW Annual Dinner THURSDAY, 3 JUNE 1999 ADDRESS BY THE HONOURABLE J.J. SPIGELMAN It is an honour to be invited to attend this import ant gathering of the magistracy. I wish to take thi s opportunity of continuing the theme of emphasis on our traditions from my last public address. On 17 May this year, the Supreme Court of New South Wales celebrated the 175th anniversary of its foundation. At the ceremonial sitting of the Court to mark the occasion, I sought to emphasise just ho w old our basic mechanisms of governance are. The Supreme Court of New South Wales is one of the oldest courts with a continuous institutional existence anywhere in the world. Australians like t o think of ours as a young country, however, when i t comes to the basic mechanisms of governance, this i s not a young country, this is an old country. In a few years, we will celebrate 150 years of represent ative and responsible government. In 2001, we will celebrate the centenary of federation. Too many Aus tralians seem to think that history is something which happened somewhere else. One of the reasons why our basic institutions recei ve such universal acceptance and legitimacy is the fact that the traditions by which they perform thei r function are of such long standing. The same is true of the magistracy. The first recor ded meeting of magistrates in New South Wales occurred on 19 February 1788 in the case of Mary Jackson . Of course, in those days the magistracy exercised the functions of Justices of the Peace un der the law of England. Initially, these were unpai d positions by which members of the upper classes mai ntained social order. As is well known, to a significant extent, Justices of the Peace continue to operate in this way in England. Amongst the original Justices of the Peace appointed in the Fir st Fleet were the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor and the Judge-Advocate, by virtue of the Letters Pa tent of 2 April 1787. The magistracy in Australia developed in a different way from England. Our prim ary tradition here is derived from the stipendiary magistrates. The creation of the Supreme Court 175 years ago mad e a significant difference to the magistracy. The New South Wales Act of 1823, an Act of the British Parliament, was the first written constitution in Australian history. It created the first Legislativ e Council, then a body of nominated members. It als o created the Supreme Court. It invested the Supreme Court, for the first time, with the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court of the Kings Bench. That created a formal hierarchy for review of decisions of the Justices of the Peace operating in New South Wa les. From the very outset of the creation of the Supreme Court, the first Chief Justice, Francis Forbes, emphasised the importance of the independence of th e judicial institution. That was dramatically exemplified in his early years as Chief Justice whe n he struck down as invalid attempts by Governor Darling to regulate the press, first by the creatio n of a licensing scheme and then by the imposition of punitive stamp duty. As Francis Forbes wrote in February 1827: \"A judge cannot be too careful of his reputation fo r independence. If he loses that he loses his necessary influence over public opinion ... his charg es bear no weight, the juries do not respect him and his decisions carrying no conviction over the m ind of the public.\" The reputation of the judiciary of this State for i ndependence and impartiality has not been doubted during the subsequent 175 years. The creation of local courts as recognisably indepe ndent judicial institutions is of more recent origi n. Its significance has been emphasised by my predecessor, Chief Justice Gleeson, in words which I am Print Page Close Window Page 1 of 4 Magistrates' Institute of NSW Annual Dinner - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_03 ... happy to adopt. In July 1997, Chief Justice Gleeson addressed the Local Courts Conference in Sydney and said: \"The point of having an independent judiciary and m agistracy is that it is not the duty of a judge, or a magistrate, to implement the policy of the Attorney General, or of any other representative of the executive government ... A judiciary which saw it as its duty to carry out the policy of the executive government could not protect the rights of citizens who came into conflict with the government, either through the criminal justice system or in civil dis putes. It was the great achievement of the former Chief Ma gistrate, Mr Briese, that he was instrumental in persuading the Governor of the day to enact the Loc al Courts Act 1982, which gave the magistracy formal legal independence from the State Public Ser vice.\" Chief Justice Gleeson's address to the Conference w as entitled \"Maintaining Independence in an Age of Accountability\". I note that Mr Justice McPherso n has chosen a similar title in his address to your conference yesterday. I am reminded that the Lord C hief Justice of England, Lord Bingham of Cornhill recently gave an address on \"The Future of the Comm on Law\". He expressed the hope that his address would be acknowledged as being in the top 1 00 of addresses so entitled. The reference to accountability in the context of j udicial independence is of considerable significanc e for all levels of the judiciary. In my introduction to the recently published Annual Review, 1998 of t he Supreme Court I said: \"Perhaps the foremost challen ge for judicial administration at the present time is to ensure that the requirements of accountability a nd efficiency remain consistent with the imperative of judicial independence .\" There can be no doubt that on some occasions, deman ds for accountability are inconsistent with judicial independence when that happens, judicial o fficers should not be shy to say so. As Chief Justi ce Gleeson said in his address two years ago: \"Many people resent judicial independence and are f rustrated by their inability to impose or invoke sanctions by way of retribution for decisions they do not like. It is an important part of the duty of the judiciary to explain to the public the importance o f judicial independence and to ensure that it is se en, not as a personal privilege of judges and magistrat es, or a some kind of perquisite of judicial office , but as a vital safeguard of the rule of law.\" However, as Chief Justice Gleeson went on to say: \"The community rightly expects appropriate accounta bility from all areas of government. The administration of justice is labour intensive and t ime consuming. It involves the expenditure of large amounts of public monies, and it involves litigants in substantial costs. ... Court delays bear heavily upon governments and citizens alike. It is beyond q uestion that governments, litigants, and the genera l public, have a legitimate interest in the efficienc y with which the courts conduct their business.\" The task of finding an appropriate balance between the requirements of efficiency and accountability on the one hand, and the traditional values of our system of justice in terms of the fairness of procedures and the quality of the decision making p rocess, on the other hand, is a continuing one. There is no simple catalogue of answers. I am consc ious that I am engaged in a process off change, together with all judicial officers in the State, a nd that this process is a continuing process. Indeed, if one looks at history of the judiciary an d the magistracy in this State, at any point of tim e an assessment of the contemporary position would ident ify the concurrent existence of continuity and change. In this regard we, like generations of our predecessors, must observe the twin requirements of respect for our traditions and recognition of the n eed for change. A traditional symbol of justice is a woman with a b lindfold, a sword and a pair of scales. The origin of this symbol is probably Themis the Greek goddess pe rsonifying justice, wisdom and good counsel, often portrayed carrying a pair of scales. The blin dfold, it appears, was introduced with the Roman goddess, Justitia. This image may need to be modifi ed in order to reflect contemporary judicial practice. When Gulliver went to Lilliput, he discov ered that the representation of the image of \"Justi ce\" in Lilliput was quite different. In Lilliput the st atue of \"Justice\" had both eyes firmly open. Indeed , the statue also had eyes in the back of the head. This is what we call case management. Page 2 of 4 Magistrates' Institute of NSW Annual Dinner - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_03 ... The administration of justice has not been, and is not, immune to the shift in attitude to the provisi on of public services which has had substantial, and ofte n adverse, impacts on many other areas of government. Major public services have endured sign ificant diminution in their ability to deliver the quantity and quality of services that they once del ivered. The pressures appear unremitting and operate virtually across the board. It is in this context that all judicial officers ha ve to conduct the heavy caseloads of their respecti ve courts. These pressures are such as to require all of us to attend to ways to speed the disposition of cases and to be sensitive to the efficient manageme nt of the caseload of the court. We must do so, however, in a context where our primary task is to conduct the cases with appropriate patience, deliberation and by procedures which are widely res pected as fair procedures. Without detracting from the proposition that there is always room for improvement, we must recognise that there are restraints on the ability to increas e productivity of the courts in the sense of maximi sing the throughput of cases in the shortest period of t ime. I have in mind the response of that ardent mic ro- economic reformer who noticed that a string quartet performed a work by Mozart in exactly the same time in 1999 as it had been performed in 1799. In s hort, for 200 years there had been no improvement in productivity. That reformer was sure that he had discovered a great scandal in the form of a collus ive arrangement amongst professional musicians. No doub t, the matter will be investigated by the ACCC. Some comments on the judicial system disclose a sim ilar approach to life. Some things take time. Justice is one of them. It i s not appropriate to assess the judicial system as if it was merely a publicly funded provider of dispute re solution services. The judicial system is the exerc ise of a governmental function, not the provision of a service to litigants as consumers. The enforcement of legal rights and obligations is a core function of government. However, contemporary expectations for all areas of government, including the administration of justice, require a continued articulation and re-ar ticulation of precisely what is done with the resou rces made available. As I have said, there is an increas ed concern with accountability and efficiency. However, we must recognise - as is true of many are as of government - that there is sometimes an inverse relationship between quantitative requireme nts and qualitative requirements. In the context of the administration of justice, qualitative requirem ents include both the fairness of the processes and the fairness of the outcomes. Not everything can be mea sured by quantitative \"performance indicators\". In the former Soviet Union, one of the few things o f which they had no shortage, was performance indicators. They called it a five year plan. There are a number of classical examples from the experience of the Soviet Union as to the distortion s which such performance indicators can have on decision making. My favourite comes from Nikita Kru shchev in one of his speeches critical of the controllers of heavy industry, whom he dismissed as \"steel eaters\". He pointed out that the five year plan had for many years contained a performance ind icator for nail manufacturers, expressed in the form of tons of nails. This proved to be inadequate , as every factory made big nails and virtually no small nails. In order to overcome the shortage of s mall nails, the new five year plan expressed the performance indicator in terms of numbers of nails, rather than in tons. The obvious occurred. In a fe w years there was a substantial shortage of big nails . This targeting of performance indicators is somethi ng which can occur with any system of measurement of performance. It is a manifestation o f one of the major blights of any system of organisations, namely the tendency to give prominen ce in decision making to institutional self interes t. This is something which both administrators of cour ts and judges must take care to avoid. I regret to say that the pressures on local courts are unlikely to attenuate. Perhaps the greatest challenge facing the legal system is to ensure that there is rational relationship between the costs o f deciding a dispute and the value or significance of the subject matter of the dispute. By costs I mean both the legal costs borne by the parties and the c ost of the administration of justice borne by the taxpayers. We are all aware of situations in which the cost, as so broadly defined, significantly outweighs any possible value associated with the su bject matter of the dispute. We have in New South Wales a tripartite hierarchy o f courts by which practices and procedures are able to be moulded to reflect the significance of t he subject matter of the dispute at, broadly, three different levels. This enables us to adapt to this need for proportionality. However, the objective mu st also be reflected within each of the three courts. Page 3 of 4 Magistrates' Institute of NSW Annual Dinner - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_03 ... The cost of litigation and the cost of legal decisi on making remains an almost intractable problem in the administration of justice. It lies at the heart of the access to justice debate. Anatole France once commented on \"The majestic equality of the law whic h forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets and to steal bread\". An English judge once expressed the same thought when he said \"In England, justice is open to all, l ike the Ritz\". By reason of difficulties of access to justice, the pressure to ensure that decisions are made in the most expeditious and efficient manner, will remain with us. Solutions will be multi-faceted. It may take th e form of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms s uch as Ombudsman created by industry or government. It may take the form of administrative tribunals. In the judicial system it will take the form of continuing expansion of the jurisdiction of loca l courts. As Chief Justice Gleeson said in November last year , in a speech to the Judicial Conference of Australia on \"The Future State of the Judicature\" - one of the top 100 with that title - after comment ing on the \"unsustainable cost of litigation\" and the \" pressure for alternative, cheaper and more efficien t methods of dispute resolution\", said in a passage w ith which I agree: \"There are already clear signs that governments are turning to the expansion of summary justice as a means of responding to some of the pressures to whi ch I have referred. Although it has not attracted a great deal of public attention, in recent years the re has been, in State jurisdictions, a clear trend towards increasing the number of criminal offences which may be dealt with summarily, rather than at a trial before a judge and jury. There is little doub t that this has been driven mainly by cost considerations. Similarly, in the area of civil jus tice, the jurisdiction of the local courts has expa nded greatly. Once again, I have no doubt that this has been influenced by the desire, in the interest of c osts and access to justice, to extend the range of civil disputes which may be dealt with summary procedures. The practical importance of the role of magistrates in the administration of civil and criminal justice is constantly increasing ...\" I wish to associate myself with the recognition by Chief Justice Gleeson on this and other occasions o f the significant, and growing, role of the local cou rts. To you will fall the task of the efficient and expeditious provision of justice for the overwhelmi ng majority of our fellow citizens. In the years ahead of me as Chief Justice, I do not expect any diminution in the intensity of public scrutiny of the efficiency with which the administr ation of justice is conducted. One of my principal tasks, not just for the Supreme Court, but for all jurisdictions in this State, is to ensure that such scrutiny remains consistent with requirements of th e independence of the judiciary, including the independence of the magistracy. I know, as all of y ou know, that the independence of a judiciary frequently irritates those of whom they are indepen dent. No-one, however, will dare to attack judicial independence directly. Rather, it is through pressu re for increased accountability and efficiency that encroachments on independence will come. In the yea rs of vigilance ahead of me with respect to such matters, I look forward to the co-operation of the magistracy. * * * Page 4 of 4 Magistrates' Institute of NSW Annual Dinner - NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_03 ... 175th Anniversary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales The anniversary we commemorate is the inauguration of a free community governed by the rule of law. The effect of the Charter of Justice, promulga ted on this day, 175 years ago, was to ensure that the Government and all persons in New South Wales w ere subject to the law. This Court, and the first Legislative Council, were both created under the New South Wales Act, a statute of the British Parliament of 1823. This was the first written constitution in Australian histo ry. There are few nations which have judicial instituti ons as old as the Supreme Court of New South Wales. We do not often recognise just how old our b asic mechanisms of governance are. The beginnings of representative government occurre d over 150 years ago. In a few years we will celebrate 150 years of representative and responsib le government. In 2001 we will celebrate the centenary of Federation. These are old traditions, by any standards. The twin great institutional traditions of our civi lisation - the rule of law and the need for consent of the governed - form part of the core content of Austral ian national identity. Their force today, reflected in the universal acceptance of the legitimacy of the i nstitutions which perform these functions, is deriv ed in large measure from the longevity of the traditio ns by which they are performed. It is appropriate t hat we commemorate these institutions. From its very inception under the first Chief Justi ce, Sir Francis Forbes, this Court established a reputation for independence and impartiality that r emains unquestioned to this day. Under Chief Justice Forbes the Court asserted its high constitu tional function of protecting individual rights and freedoms. The early decisions of this Court - now, insofar as they have survived, available in accessible form for the first time on the Macquarie University website - speak in terms that we still readily appreciate. The first constitutional case in Australian history concerned the right to trial by jury in a criminal trial at Quarter Sessions. This issue reflected the major po litical divide of the time: between emancipated convicts and the \"exclusives\". The latter, predomin ant amongst the Justices of the Peace who conducted the trials, objected to a jury system in a society with so many emancipated convicts. Chief Justice Forbes held that trial by jury was a birthright of all free men and women. He referred t o the Magna Carta and the development of English cons titutional law. He ordered the justices to sit with juries. The authority of the Court was also invoked to ensu re the creation of free institutions, specifically freedom of the press. Within a month of their admis sion in September 1824 as the first barristers of this Court, William Charles Wentworth and Robert Wa rdell, established The Australian , the first newspaper in our history to be critical of the Gove rnment. Its reportage, and that of its followers, s oon incensed Governor Darling. The Governor proposed legislation to require all ne wspapers to obtain licenses. Under the 1823 constitution, the Legislative Council could not pas s legislation if the Chief Justice proclaimed it to be \"repugnant to the laws of England\". Chief justice F orbes struck down the newspaper licensing bill as such. He said: \"By the laws of England every free man has the righ t of using the common trade of printing and publishing newspapers; by the proposed Bill this right is confined to such persons only as the Governor may deem proper. By th e laws of England, the liberty of the press is regarded as a constitutional privilege , which liberty consists in exemption from previous restraints; by the proposed Bill, a p reliminary licence is required which is to destroy the freedom of the press and to place it at the discretion of the government ...\" Governor Darling then proposed to impose a stamp du ty on all newspapers in an amount which would have crippled a number of newspapers, including the Australian. Chief Justice Forbes declared the stamp duty bill invalid. The licensing scheme was overturned by the refusal of a certificate by the Chief Justice. Although, in substance, this was a kind of judicial review, it d id not survive in those terms. The stamp duty bill, however, was struck down in a different way. The New South Wales Act of 1823 permitted the impos ition of taxes for stated purposes. Forbes boldly asserted that the true purpose of the stamp duty on newspapers was not for the public works stated in the Act. Rather, the true purpose was to destroy certain newspapers. This is a form of judicial review of the validity o f legislation with which we are very familiar, part icularly in the context of the Commonwealth Constitution. It is of abiding significance that the first time in Australian history that a Court exercised this form of judicial review was to protect the right of fre e speech.

The assertion of judicial independence, so dramatic ally manifest in this confrontation, has never been the subject of serious challenge. Over 175 years, i t has been, and remains, a fortification of freedom in this nation. The capacity for such independence is now, and has always been, nurtured by the strength and autonomy of the legal profession, from which the ju diciary is drawn. That strength and autonomy, in turn, is a product of the adversary system. Throughout the history of this Court, in any procee dings, including those in which the State is a part y, the litigants determine, in large measure, what iss ues are raised and how they are fought. This system reflects the significance our society attaches to t he autonomy of individuals and to the maintenance o f personal freedoms. Individuals are entitled to exer cise control over their own lives. They are entitle d to participate in decisions which affect their lives t o the maximum degree possible. No arm of the State controls how they conduct their legal affairs Even in a criminal case, the State, appearing in th e guise of a prosecution authority, is required to conduct the entirety of the proceedings as if it we re an ordinary litigant in the Court. It receives n o privileges. It receives no special access to the ma gistracy or the judiciary. Its right to call or int errogate witnesses, or to make submissions, is no different from that of any other litigant in the Court. Personal autonomy and participation have very deep roots in this country. One of the reasons why these values are so secure, is because for 175 year s they have been, and continue to be, reflected many times every day in the procedures within our C ourts, indeed in the very structure of our courtrooms. History suggests that the inquisitorial system with which our own is sometimes compared, is compatible with a society of either dictatorship or freedom. The adversary system is only compatible with a society of freedom. In an adversary system t he administration of justice and the autonomous legal profession are protective devices of freedom. That is not a function necessarily performed by th e administration of justice or by the lawyers in an i nquisitorial system. It is true that the adversary system is not the che apest form of legal decision making. However, nor i s parliamentary democracy the cheapest form of govern ment. There is a tendency today to treat the Courts as so me form of public funded dispute resolution service. Such an approach would deny the whole of t he heritage we have gathered here to commemorate. This Court does not provide a service to litigants as consumers. The Court administers justice in accordance with law. This is a core func tion of government. In conclusion, I wish to acknowledge the speakers h ere today. Mr Carr as the Premier of New South Wales, represents the great institutional tradition of Parliamentary democracy. Our other speakers represent both that tradition and the intertwined t radition of the rule of law. The Presidents of the Bar Association and the Law S ociety, Mr Barker and Ms Hole, were good enough to step aside on this occasion and to have t heir respective memberships represented by two of their most distinguished former practitioners, o ne of whom, Mr Whitlam has served, and the other, Mr Howard now serves, as the Prime Minister of this country. Their histories personify the interconnection of the two great traditions of our mechanisms of governance - parliamentary democracy and the rule of law - and the respect eac h has always shown for the other. The tradition of the rule of law is reflected in th e presence on the bench of my two immediate predecessors, Sir Laurence Street and Chief Justice Gleeson. Between them they served as Chief Justice of this Court for 24 years. Their presence here today personifies an abiding characteristic of our legal tradition: the concurrent existence of co ntinuity and change. There is an embedded wisdom in institutions which h ave grown and developed over long periods of time. Experience indicates that contemporary custod ians of such institutions, and those whose conduct can impinge on their activities, should app roach their tasks with an element of humility. Afte r 175 years of tradition, it is appropriate that we s hould conclude in that spirit. The Court will now adjourn. As acknowledged in his judgments by the first Chef Justice of this Court, Sir Francis Forbes, for thousands of years before the arrival of British ju stice, the aborigines made and enforced laws in thi s land. It is appropriate that we recognise that prior trad ition on this occasion.

Compensation Court Annual Conference FRIDAY 7 MAY 1999 THE HONOURABLE J.J. SPIGELMAN My second judgment as a judge was an appeal from th e Dust Diseases Tribunal, James Hardie Industries Pty. Limited v Grigor (1998) 45 NSWLR 20. It proved to be a dissenting j udgment. In the course of that judgment, I had occasion to refe r to the need for the courts to adapt to the limited resources available for the administration of justice in New South Wales. The case involved the institution in the Dust Disea ses Tribunal of proceedings by a New Zealand resident arising from the purchase of mater ials in New Zealand. My comments concerned whether or not demands on the judicial re sources in this State are such that this should be a permissible element to take into accoun t when exercising the jurisdiction to stay proceedings on forum non conveniens grounds, as is the case in the United States. I concluded that this course could not be followed in Australia in view of the High Court's decision in Voth v Manildra Flour Mills Pty. Limited (1990) 171 CLR 538. The pressure on judges in all jurisdictions to do m ore with less is the theme I wish to develop with you today. Before coming to our own situation, however, let me share with you the observations of Judge Kent of the United States District Court of South C entral Texas. Proceedings were taken by the Republic of Bolivia against a number of American to bacco companies for the health care costs which the government of that country had incurred i n treating illnesses suffered as a result of tobacco use. It was, apparently, one of six differe nt suits brought by the governments of Guatemala, Panama, Nicaragua, Thailand, Venezuela a nd Bolivia in various locations in the United States and in both State and Federal Courts. The Bolivian proceedings had been commenced in the District Court of Brazoria County, Texas - a state Court - and then, by some form of cross-vesting, were sent to the United Stat es District Court in Galveston, Texas - a federal Court. Judge Kent's judgment is a model of its kind for a cross-vesting decision: \"... this humble Court by the sea is certainly flatte red by what must be the worldwide renown of rural Texas courts for dispensing justice with unpa ralleled fairness and alacrity, apparently in common discussion even on the mountain peaks of Bol ivia. Still, the Court would be remiss in accepting an obligation for which it truly does not have the necessary resources. Only one judge presides in the Galveston Division - which currentl y has before it over seven hundred cases and annual civil filings exceeding such number - and th at judge is presently burdened with a significant personal situation which diminishes its ability to always give the attention it would like to all of its daunting docket obligations, despite genuinely heroic efforts to do so. And, while Galveston is indeed an international sea port, the capacity of this Court to address the complex and sophisticated issues of international l aw and foreign relations presented by this case is dwarfed by that of its esteemed colleagues in the District of Columbia who deftly address such awesome tasks as a matter of course. Indeed, t his Court, while doing its very best to address the more prosaic matters routinely before i t, cannot think of a Bench better versed and more capable of handling precisely this type of cas e, which requires a high level of expertise in international matters. In fact, proceedings brought by the Republic of Guatemala are currently well underway in that Court in a related action, an d there is a request now before the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to transfer to th e United States District Court for the District of Columbia all six tobacco actions brought by foreign governments, ostensibly for consolidated treatment. Such a Bench, well-populated with genuin ely renowned intellects, can certainly better bear and share the burden of multidistrict litigati on than this single judge division, where the judge moves his lips when he reads ... Regardless of, and having nothing to do with, the o utcome of Defendant's request for transfer and consolidation, it is the Court's opinion that t he District of Columbia, located in this Nation's capital, is a much more logical venue for the parti es and witnesses in this action because, Print Page Close Window Page 1 of 6 Compensation Court Annual Conference - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_07 ... among other things, Plaintiff has an embassy in Was hington, D.C., and thus a physical presence and governmental representatives there, whereas the re isn't even a Bolivian restaurant anywhere near here. Although the jurisdiction of th is Court boasts no similar foreign offices, a somewhat dated globe is within its possession. Whil e the Court does not therefrom profess to understand all of the political subtleties of the g eographical transmogrifications ongoing in Eastern Europe, the Court is virtually certain that Bolivia is not within the four counties over which this Court presides, even though the words Bo livia and Brazoria are a lot alike and caused some real, initial confusion until the Court conferred with its law clerks. Thus, it is readily apparent, even from an outdated globe such as that possessed by this Court, that Bolivia, a hemisphere away, ain't in south-cen tral Texas, and that, at the very least, the District of Columbia is a more appropriate venue (t hough Bolivia isn't located there either). Furthermore, as this Judicial District bears no sig nificant relationship to any of the matters at issue, and the judge of this Court simply loves cig ars, the Plaintiff can be expected to suffer neither harm nor prejudice by a transfer to Washing ton, D.C., a Bench better able to rise to the smoky challenges presented by this case, despite th e alleged and historic presence there of countless smoke-filled rooms. Consequently, pursuan t to 28 U.S.C. 1404(a), for the convenience of parties and witnesses, and in the in terest of justice, this case is hereby TRANSFERRED to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. IT IS SO ORDERED. S.D. Tex., 1999.\" When assessing the resources available for the admi nistration of justice, we must remain conscious of the fact that there are limits to the proportion of the gross national product that this, or any other country, can afford to expend on its l egal system. The administration of justice is not immune to the substantial shift in attitude to the provision of public services which has had substantial and adver se impacts on many other areas of government. Major public services have endured sign ificant diminution in their ability to deliver the quantity and quality of services that they once delivered. The pressures appear unremitting, virtually across the board. I have in the past had positions in government whic h involved participation in central resource allocation decisions. I have personal experience of how difficult it is to make decisions between allocating resources to, say, tertiary education or hospitals and allocating resources to courts or legal aid. Contemporary expectations for all areas of governme nt, including the administration of justice, require a continued articulation and rearticulation of precisely what is done with the resources made available. There is an increased concern with accountability and efficiency. Indeed, perhaps the foremost challenge for judicial adminis tration at the present time is to ensure that contemporary expectations of accountability and eff iciency remain consistent with the imperative of judicial independence. I do not need to explain to this audience why the latter is of importance. The first and most basic proposition which represen tatives of the judiciary must articulate at every opportunity is that the most important criter ia by which the performance of courts must be judged are qualitative, namely the fairness of the processes and the fairness of the outcomes. Statistics, based on criteria like the number of ca ses disposed of within particular time periods, acquire an inappropriate significance by reason of their concreteness. In the law, as in other areas of public activity, the most important matter s are not susceptible to precise measurement by way of what is sometimes called \"performance ind icators\". In the former Soviet Union one of the few things of which they had no shortage was performance indicators. They called it a five year plan. There are a number of classic examples from the experience of the Soviet Union as to the d istorting effects which performance indicators can have on decision-making. My favourite comes fro m Nikita Krushchev in one of his speeches critical of the controllers of heavy industry, whom he dismissed as \"steel eaters\". He pointed out that the five year plan had for many years containe d a performance indicator for nail manufacturers expressed in the form of tons of nail s. This proved to be inadequate as every factory made a huge number of big nails and virtual ly no small nails. In order to overcome the shortage of small nails, a new five year plan expre ssed the performance indicator in terms of numbers of nails, rather than tons. The obvious rea ction was that in a few years there was a large shortage of big nails. Page 2 of 6 Compensation Court Annual Conference - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_07 ... The first danger of which we must all be particular ly wary is to not target the performance indicators. If one attempts to change the temperatu re by manipulating the thermometer, eventually you will be caught out. A second danger, not dissimilar to what I have just described, that arises from the combination of financial stringency and \"performance indicators \" is the tendency of institutional self-interest to be given excessive prominence in decision-making. O ne manifestation of this is the pre- occupation with targeting the measures of performan ce, as in the nail example, rather than servicing the need. Another manifestation is the im perative to organise one's affairs in such a way as to the externalise costs. This can be done i n numerous ways and administrators of Courts and Judges must be on guard against this tem ptation. The most obvious way that this happens is for Court s to over list cases. This minimises the amount of downtime within Courts and so enables the Court to get through a larger volume of work, as measured. However, it has adverse effects on parties whose cases are not reached. Their costs are increased, generally quite dispropo rtionately to what the Court \"saves\". There is a very real balancing exercise involved in this pro cess and it is not an easy one. We must all be sensitive to the extent to which a Court by its own practices imposes costs on parties or other persons, like witnesses. None of this is to suggest that productivity improv ements are not feasible. I am hopeful, for example, that the application of new technology lik e video conferencing will enable productivity improvements within the Courts and also significant ly reduce the costs imposed on the legal system as a whole. There are, however, very significant restraints on the ability to increase productivity of the Courts in the sense of maximising the throughput of cases in the shortest period of time. I have particularly in mind the response of an ardent micr o-economic reformer who noticed that a string quartet performs a work by Mozart in exactly the sa me time in 1999 as it was performed in 1799. In short there has been no increase in productivity for 200 years. This reformer, sure that a great scandal had been discovered in the form of a collus ive arrangement amongst professional musicians, referred the matter to the ACCC. Some co mments on the judicial system disclose a similar approach to life. Some things take time. Justice is one of them. We m ust never lose sight of the fact that it is not appropriate to assess the judicial system as if it was merely a publicly funded provider of dispute resolution services. The judicial system is the exe rcise of a governmental function, not the provision of a service to litigants as consumers. T he enforcement of legal rights and obligations is a core function of government. This is of course most clear in the case of crimina l trials. If all we were concerned about was the most efficient mechanism for determining guilt or i nnocence, then our system would operate quite differently to the way it does. We would not have open trials in public; we would dispense with many requirements of procedure and standards o f proof; we would dispense with the presumption of innocence; Judges, insofar as they m ake relevant determinations, would simply make them without giving reasons. The whole process would work much more effectively and economically behind closed doors without the interf erence of lawyers. As Chief Justice Gleeson has pointed out, that is the way criminal justice i s administered in some places, but we do not now believe, and have never believed, that that is how it should be done. In the area of civil justice there are similar cons iderations both with respect to the substantive law and to the procedures by which cases are decide d. The law and its procedures both reflect and affect our society's values. Even in the contex t of resolving a private dispute there is a broader public purpose. It is what economists would called an externality. Even a civil trial involves, on many occasions, a p ublic affirmation that one party is right and the other party is wrong. Denunciation of conduct has a role to play in the outcome of civil disputes and in the reasons for judgment by trial judges. Pe rhaps this does not operate to the same degree as in criminal cases, but nevertheless there is such a role for civil trials. Similarly, the concepts of general and specific det errence, which play such a significant role in the criminal justice system, also have a role in th e civil justice system. The area of Page 3 of 6 Compensation Court Annual Conference - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_07 ... compensation for injuries at work is a good example . The determination of civil cases through the mechanism of resolving individual disputes may have an impact by deterring employers from engaging in unsafe practices and providing an incen tive for them to improve their practices, either directly or through their insurance premiums . These are public purposes served by the process of private dispute resolution. Of course they are consistent with the settlement of those dispute s. But the courts accessibility serves a public purpose which constitutes an \"externality\" - i.e. a public benefit over and above the private benefit - that economists would accept as relevant to the process of making decisions about the allocation of resources. There is also the \"externality\" in the form of writ ten judgments. The clear articulation of the reasons for a decision in a particular case serves the purpose of avoiding other disputes. That is, an \"externality\" unrelated to the resolution of a dispute in the particular case. Published decisions enable lawyers to advise their clients of the likely outcome if they pursue a dispute. I wish to direct attention to the constitutional ro le of the Courts which serve public purposes beyond the interests of the parties to a dispute. T his most clearly arises where the Courts are determining matters such as the powers of governmen t and Parliament, the enforcement of the rights of citizens and in other ways maintaining th e institutional structure of our polity and of our other important social institutions. The judicial s ystem provides a forum parallel to our parliamentary system for the public discourse by wh ich our society and polity affirms its core values, applies them and adapts them to changing ci rcumstances. There is another role properly described as \"consti tutional\". The Courts maintain the rule of law and develop the common law: public functions of gre at and abiding significance. The ability of our system of law to continually replenish itself a nd to adapt itself to new circumstances, is one of the essential elements of the success of our soc iety and the social stability with which we are blessed. These are achievements of which to be prou d. The role of the judicial system in performing this function goes well beyond the provi sion of services to litigants as consumers. However, because these benefits are intangible and not susceptible to measurement, they are all too frequently ignored. I do not mean, by my emphasis on the public purpose s served by the resolution of individual disputes, to detract from the significance to the i ndividuals of proper and measured determination of their own cases. Some years ago Ju dge Tate of the United States put the matter well when he said: \"In the gigantic industrial societies of the twenti eth century, the courts are one of the last institutions where individuals receive individualized treatment. No matter how hopeless an appeal may be, it is not frivolous to the appellant, because it re presents his hopes for individualized justice against the alleged prejudic ial decisions of an institution in an impersonal society. The price of individualized consideration, essential in a democratic society fo unded upon the individual's importance, is necessarily high. The c ourts must consider many worthless appeals for fear of missing the one with merit. In its efforts to assure prompt consideration of al l claims, the court system must not become just another bureaucracy, cr amming litigation papers into suitable slots or at least t he closest-fitting cubbyhole, While we may adopt more efficient proced ures to find and decide quickly the easily-decided cases, these appe als must receive the same deliberative consideration in their dispos ition as do the more difficult matters.\" The overriding requirement of the judicial process is to do justice in the circumstances of the individual case. This requirement potentially confl icts with any attempt to impose managerial concepts of efficiency on Judges. The judicial oath which we all take requires us to : \"Do right to all manner of people after the laws and usages of t his State without fear or favour or ill will\". It i s difficult to get managerial considerations into tha t oath. That is not to say that some aspects of efficient c onduct are not required for the purpose of Page 4 of 6 Compensation Court Annual Conference - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP justice. Exces sive delay is itself a form of injustice. As it is often put \"Justice delayed is justice denied\". Howe ver, it must also be recognised that \"Justice rushed is justice denied\". The formulation of judgment takes time for proper r eflection. There has been considerable focus on delay in the delivery of judgments. This needs t o be balanced with the recognition that the quality of the decision-making process, and its val ue for purposes of preventing future disputes, is enhanced by reflection, i.e. delay in the articu lation of reasons. This must occur, of course, within reasonable limits. I do not claim that there is any easy resolution of the dilemma that arises from the inverse relationship between efficiency and quality in the judicial process. Each of you will have been confronted with issues of this character. The heavy caseloads of the Courts are such as to require all of us to attend to ways to speed the di sposition of cases and to the efficient management of the caseload of the Court. On the oth er hand, trials must be conducted with appropriate patience, deliberation and by procedure s which are manifestly fair procedures. We are now well advanced into a new era of manageri al judging which has changed the perception amongst Judges of their own functions. T here has been a shift in the responsibility for management of civil litigation away from litiga nts and their legal advisers towards the Court. This is a process which has been carried further in some jurisdictions than in others. It is a process that all Courts have been engaged in for ov er a decade. It is not yet complete. The task of finding an appropriate balance between the requirements of efficiency and throughput, on the one hand, and the traditional va lues of our system of justice, on the other, is a continuing one. I do not claim that there is a si mple catalogue of answers. I am conscious that I am engaged in a process of change, together with all judicial officers in the State, and which is a continuing process. We must always recognise in our deliberations as ju dicial officers that our primary task is to administer justice in accordance with law. It is no t our task to please the parties who appear before us. When David Hunt was presiding over the t rial of Ivan Milat he was not providing a service to a customer whom he should have sought to please. Whilst that is obvious in the administration of the criminal justice system, it i s a proposition that is equally applicable in relation to civil justice. Employees who seek compe nsation for injuries they have suffered at work, just like individuals who sue for defamation or breach of contract or for any tort, do not want their case to be heard by a Judge who believes that one of his purposes in life is to send both parties away happy. Any such litigant wants th e Judge to make an objective and impartial decision and to do so irrespective of how much that might offend the other party. It is in this context that we must assess the frequ ently expressed preference for encouraging settlements or alternative dispute resolutions mech anisms. Parties who settle because they do not believe they can afford to litigate or because they suspect that their cause will not receive just and impartial treatment, or to receive such tr eatment but on a time scale which is unacceptable to them, do not necessarily go away sa tisfied with the fairness of the process. Settlement in and of itself does not necessarily me an satisfaction. We do not live in a Confucian society in which over riding value is given to the harmonious resolution of disputes for the sake of retaining ha rmony. Obviously where continuing relations are required there is a value in settlement for its own sake. However, one of the strengths of Western civilisation is that it is a society in whi ch rights are recognised. The administration of justice is the means of enforcing rights. I have mentioned that courts must be sensitive to t he extent to which their procedures impose cost on parties. The cost of litigation remains the single most significant, and apparently intractable, problem in the administration of justi ce. It lies at the heart of the access to justice debate. We are all aware of the frequency with whic h there appears to be no rational or reasonable proportion between the costs of particul ar litigation and the amount in dispute. For many cases, our way of resolving matters of litigat ion, is simply not sustainable in the long term. In a sense this involves what an economist would ca ll \"market failure\". Let me return, for a moment, to the perspective of micro -economics. In a market for legal services in which Page 5 of 6 Compensation Court Annual Conference - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_07 ... knowledge were perfect, clients would ensure that t he costs of litigation would be minimised and reasonably proportionate to the value to them of su ccess in the litigation. However, the inadequacies of information available to clients ab out the legal process and about the skills of their own lawyers, prevent them exercising control over the market for legal services in this way. Courts have been called upon to involve themselves in the conduct of litigation to a degree which was once thought incompatible with the advers ary system. Managerial judging may be regarded as a form of state regulation by judicial officers to offset the market failure caused by the inadequacy of information about legal services available to individual clients. This comparatively new imperative coincides with th e objective of minimising the cost to the judicial process itself by reason of the frequency with which persons do not pursue their causes of action with reasonable expedition in such a mann er as to impose costs on the court system eg adjournments which result in downtime. The two imperatives for managerial judging are diff erent and do not always coincide. It may be that early intervention by Judges to manage cases w ill add to the costs of litigation for parties. This plainly occurs where significant expenditure o f resources is required at an early stage after the institution of proceedings with respect to case s which were likely to settle in any event. In such cases active case management by Judges imposes costs which would not otherwise be incurred. There have been a large number of changes both by s tatute and by Court practice, motivated in part by excessive costs: rights of action have been abolished or quantum limits on recovery have been imposed; rights of appeal have been aboli shed or leave requirements introduced; the right to jury trial has been significantly attenuat ed; numerous procedural changes have been made eg interrogatories are almost extinct and disc overy has been restricted; the pressure on judges to hear more cases more quickly and to deliv er judgments more quickly has been unremitting. The combined effect of restrictions on public fundi ng of the administration of justice, together with continuing concerns about the cost of litigati on, will require us all to continue to make or endure changes of this character. They have, howeve r, very real effects on the quality of justice which are not always acknowledged. One of the many ways in which quantity and quality are inversely related arises in the context of specialisation by judges. It is possible that maxim um efficiency would occur by treating all judges as a single pool and throwing them at lists. This would maximise the throughput of cases. Quality of decision-making and public confidence in the courts is usually enhanced by specialisation either in separate courts eg the Com pensation Court or the Land and Environment Court, and specialist divisions within courts such as the Dust Diseases Tribunal or the divisions in the Supreme Court - Equity, Common Law and Court of Appeal. When I accepted appointment to the office I now hol d, I did not really appreciate that so much of my time would be taken up with issues of this kind. I have the comfort to know that I am not alone. There is not likely to be any diminution in the int ensity of public scrutiny of the efficiency with which the administration of justice is conducted. O ne of my principal tasks, not just for the Supreme Court but for all jurisdictions, is to do w hat I can to ensure that such scrutiny has a qualitative and not merely a quantitative dimension . * * * Page 6 of 6 Compensation Court Annual Conference - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_07 ... The Tradition of Ethical Service by Members of the Legal Profession Comments of the Chief Justice, The Honourable JJ Sp igelman, on the Admission of Legal Practitioners to the Supreme Court of New South Wal es, 9 April 1999 Spigelman, CJ Studdert, J Dunford, J THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW SOUTH WALES BANCO COURT 9 April 1999 The formal part of these proceedings is now complet e but before the Court adjourns I should like to offer a few words of congratulations and of welcome to the newly admitted legal practitioners of this Court. This is an important occasion for you. It is also a n important occasion for the Court. Present with me on the Bench this morning is Justice Studdert to my right and Justice Dunford to my left. Together we constitute the Court that has, in the due exercise of its jurisdiction, admitted you to practice. The first thing I want to say to you is that you ar e all individually welcome. You have arrived here a fter a long and successful course of study and in many c ases, a lengthy period of practical training. You are entitled to be proud of your achievement and yo ur family and friends are entitled to be proud of your achievement. On this occasion, I wish to draw your attention to two matters, which distinguish the legal profession from other occupations; I refer in the context of a Court with a long tradition and a profession with a long tradition. On 17 May this year, this Court will celebrate the 175th Anniversary of its formation. We Australians like to think of ourselves as a young country. When it comes to the basic institutions of governance and of the rule of law, this is not a young country . This is an old country. The number of nations that can say that they have j udicial institutions of this antiquity, are to be numbered on the fingers of one hand. This year is a significant year in terms of reinforcing the lengt h and the depth of the traditions that this Court rep resents and of its relationship with the profession . As legal practitioners you have professional obliga tions, including ethical obligations to your client s and obligations to this Court. These obligations ar e what distinguish a profession from a business or from a job. There is no doubt that many aspects of the law constitute a business. But it is not only a business or a job and that is an important distinct ion. One of the most important aspects of the legal syst em is that it depends on the performance of professional obligations by professional people. In a period of this Nation's history, when more and more things are judged merely by economic standards , it is important that some spheres of conduct affirm that there are other values in life. The val ues of justice, truth and fairness, are central to the activities of the legal system. That is why that sy stem cannot be assessed only by economic criteria. The obligations you have as professional practition ers to this Court, include a duty of full disclosur e of the relevant law; a duty of candour not to mislead the Court, or to knowingly permit your client to do so; a duty to refuse to permit the commencement, or continuance of any baseless proceedings; a duty to exercise care before making any allegations of m isconduct against any person and to test any instructions you might receive from your client in that regard; a duty not to assist in any form of improper conduct; and a duty to conduct cases in th is Court efficiently and expeditiously. Performance of some of these duties may, on occasio ns, conflict with your client's interests, or indee d Print Page Close Window Page 1 of 2 The Tradition of Ethical Service by Members of the Legal Profession - Supreme Cour ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_13 ... his or her enthusiasms. Nevertheless, they are obli gations of a professional character that you owe to the Court. The second matter to which I wish to refer, is the criticism that is often made of the law, in its pra ctical operation in our society, to the effect that it ope rates unevenly and perhaps unfairly in some section s of that society. As a general rule people who are popular, or powerf ul, or wealthy, or who enjoy the support of a majority, either do not need, or do not have any di fficulty in securing the protection of the law. The people who need the protection are the weak, the fr iendless people who are accused of crime or other disgraceful conduct, people who can appeal only to the law to protect and vindicate their rights. There is, in certain sections of the community at t he moment, a great deal of impatience with the law' s insistence upon upholding the rights of unpopular p eople. History shows that you cannot be selective about granting or withholding rights which people h ave on a basis such as their current popularity. In many cases the assertion by an unpopular individual of a legal right will offend a majority in the community. It is basic to our society's values that , where necessary, the law will insist upon respect for that individual's right. That is why justice is administered by independent, unelected judges who do not need to be constantly seeking popularity, or the approval of g overnments. Lawyers are a part of this system and must be prepared to stand up for individuals and mi norities, even at the risk of incurring the resentment and anger of the majority. The performance of professional obligations to the Court, the maintenance of ethical obligations and the protection of the rights of the unpopular, does not involve an easy path. As each of you face the challenges and tribulations of dealing with clients and superiors, you should remember the support you can always receive from th e broader professional community which you join today. For many of you this is an important family occasio n. Those of you who have recently completed a long course of study will be celebrating with famil y and friends your success. Many of you, no doubt, owe a great deal to the support that you have recei ved over the period of your study and training from your relatives and friends. It is always a source o f great pleasure to the judges of this Court to see so many relatives and friends participating in this im portant ceremony. I hope that this is a happy and memorable occasion for you all. On behalf of all the judges of this Court, I congra tulate you on your admission and wish you a warm welcome to the legal profession of this State. The Court will now adjourn. Page 2 of 2 The Tradition of Ethical Service by Members of the Legal Profession - Supreme Cour ... Interpretatio n - Identifying the Linguistic delivered at the University of Newcastle - 23 March 1999 by The Honourable JJ Spigelman Chief Justice of New South Wales In the second Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture delivered on 10 March 1993, the Honourable Justice McHugh of the High Court of Australia said: \"Legislation is the cornerstone of the modern legal system.\" His Honour's lecture was entitled \"The Growth of Le gislation and Litigation\". His Honour emphasised the centrality of the law of statutory interpretati on to the functions of the profession and the judic iary. The overwhelming majority of cases in the Courts re quire reference to statutory provisions. Something in the order of half of all cases require the Court to construe a statute. The constitutional signific ance of statutory interpretation should also be noted. A number of the rules of construction, to which I wi ll refer, make it clear that the common law's protecti on of fundamental rights and liberties is secreted within the law of statutory interpretation. I wish to deal with one aspect of statutory interpr etation in this lecture: How do we select the meani ng of words capable of application at different levels of generality? That is to say, when Parliament use s general words does it intend to encompass everythin g that is capable of falling within them? The title that I have chosen for this lecture is \"I dentifying the Linguistic Register\". This is a form ulation that I have adopted from Lord Simon of Glaisdale. I n a case concerned with the meaning of the word \"premises\" in the British Rent Act 1968, his Lordsh ip said: \"Statutory language, like all language, is capable of an almost infinite gradation of 'register' - i.e . it will be used at the semantic level appropriate to the su bject matter and to the audience addressed (the man in the street, lawyers, merchants, etc). It is the duty of a court of construction to tune in to s uch register and so to interpret the statutory language as to give to it the primary meaning which is appropriate in that register (unless it is clear th at some other meaning must be given in order to car ry out the statutory purpose or to avoid injustice, an omaly, absurdity or contradiction). In other words statutory language must always be given presumptive ly the most natural and ordinary meaning which is appropriate in the circumstances.\"1 Lord Simon of Glaisdale returned to this issue in a subsequent case where his Lordship said: \"If a court of construction places itself in the po sition of the draftsman, acquires his knowledge, recognises his statutory objectives, tunes into his linguistic register, and then ascertains the prima ry and natural meaning in their context of the words h e has used, that will generally be an end of the ta sk of construction. But occasionally something will go wrong. It may become apparent that the primary and natural meaning cannot be what Parliament inten ded: it produces injustice, absurdity, anomaly or contradiction, or it stultifies or runs counter to the statutory objective.\"2 Ambiguity The identification of the appropriate \"linguistic r egister\" is not the same as resolving an \"ambiguity \": understood in the sense that a word or phrase may h ave more than one meaning. This is the sense in which the word \"ambiguity\" is generally used. However, the word \"ambiguity\" itself, perhaps ironi cally enough, is not without its own difficulty. Frequently, in the context of statutory interpretat ion, the word \"ambiguity\" is used in a more general sense. It is applied, not only to situations in whi ch a word has more than one meaning, but to any situation in which the intention of Parliament with respect to the scope of a particular statutory situation is, for whatever reason, doubtful.

As the authors of the third edition of Cross on Sta tutory Interpretation state: \"In the context of statutory interpretation the wor d most frequently used to indicate the doubt which a judge must entertain before he can search for, and if possible, apply a secondary meaning is 'ambiguity'. In ordinary language this term is ofte n confined to situations in which the same word is capable of meaning two different things; but in rel ation to statutory interpretation, judicial usage sanctions the application of the word 'ambiguity' t o describe any kind of doubtful meaning of words, phrases, or longer statutory provisions.\"3 A similar broad approach to the concept of \"ambigui ty\" is reflected in a judgment of Justice O'Connor in 1906, when his Honour said: \"It has been contended in this case that an ambigui ty must appear on the face of a statute before you can apply the rules of interpretation relating to a mbiguities. In one sense that is correct, and in an other sense it is not. You will frequently find an Act of Parliament perfectly clear on the face of it, and it is only when you apply it to the subject matter that t he ambiguity appears. That ambiguity arises frequently from the use of general words. And where ver general words are used in a statute there is always a liability to find a difficulty in applying general words to the particular case. It is often doubtful whether the legislature used the words in the gener al unrestricted sense, or in a restricted sense wit h reference to some particular subject matter.\"4 The Contemporary Approach Justice McHugh has identified the task of the conte mporary interpreter, in a judgment which is frequently referred to with approval, in the follow ing way: \"A rule of law enacted by statute consists of a pro position which gives rise to legal consequences when the act or omission of some person falls withi n the factual outline delineated by that proposition ... The difficulty is to determine whet her Parliament intended a particular set of facts t o fall within the factual outline of the proposition. That is, the difficulty is to determine the ambit of th e factual outline which Parliament intended to enact.\"5 His Honour has explained the contemporary approach to this process: \"In many cases, the grammatical or literal meaning of a statutory provision will give effect to the purpose of the legislation. Consequently, it will c onstitute the 'ordinary meaning' to be applied. If however, the literal or grammatical meaning of a pr ovision does not give effect to that purpose, that meaning cannot be regarded as the 'ordinary meaning ' and cannot prevail. It must give way to the construction which will promote the underlying purp ose or object of an Act ...\"6 His Honour went on to quote from the frequently cit ed judgment of Mason and Wilson JJ, where their Honours said, inter alia: \"The propriety of departing from the literal interp retation ... extends to any situation in which for good reason the operation of the statute on a literal re ading does not conform to the legislative intent as ascertained from the provisions of the statute, inc luding the policy which may be discerned from those provisions.\"7 The purposive approach to statutory construction is now enshrined in statute.8 It is not without its difficulties.9 It must not be forgotten that the ta sk is to identify the meaning of what Parliament sa id, not to identify what Parliament meant to say.10 Context The contemporary Australian approach to constructio n is the same as Justice Learned Hand once expressed: \"Of course it is true that the words used, even in their literal sense, are the primary, and ordinaril y the most reliable, source of interpreting the meaning o f any writing: be it a statute, a contract or anyth ing else. But it is one of the surest indexes of a matu re developed jurisprudence not to make a fortress o ut of the dictionary; but to remember that statutes al ways have some purpose or object to accomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their meaning.\"11 A good short hand description of this approach is \" literal in total context\".12 Wherever general words must be construed, it is essential for the interpre ter to bear in mind that a statute has a context, i t has Page 2 of 12 Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture: Statutory Interpretatio n - Supr ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_23 ... a background and it reflects assumptions as to the circumstances in which it will operate. The words of a statute do not exist in limbo.13 Let me give you one example of this principle at wo rk.14 Parents leave their children in the care of a childminder. They suggest that to keep the children amused, the childminder should teach them a game of cards. After the parents leave, the childmi nder teaches the children to play strip poker. The natural and ordinary meaning of the words \"game of cards\" is, merely, a game played with cards. Strip poker falls within that natural and ordinary meaning. However, there seems little doubt that the meaning which the parents intended for the words th ey chose, did not encompass this particular example of such a game. The reason for that is the context. In accordance with what one would assume to be the generally accepted conception of t he proper upbringing of children, parents do not intend the words \"game of cards\" to extend to a gam e of this character, at least in relation to their children. Another example is found in a controversial civil l iberties case from Australian history. I refer to t he case of Egon Kisch, a radical political figure, to whom the Commonwealth government of the day, in 1934, wished to deny entry into Australia. The rele vant legislation entitled a Commonwealth official t o administer a dictation test to any prospective entr ant. The legislative provision permitted such a tes t to be \"in a European language\". Kisch, a national of C zechoslovakia, was asked to submit to a test in Scottish Gaelic. The High Court refused to accept t hat this was permissible. Sir Owen Dixon said: \"It appears to me that the objects which the legisl ature had in view would not be furthered by attachi ng to that expression (i.e. 'a European language') a m eaning which is arrived at by disintegrating the phrase into its component words and asking oneself, first - is it a language? and then is it European? ... The rules of interpretation require u s to take expressions in their context and to const rue them with proper regard to the subject matter with which the instrument deals and the objects it seeks to achieve, so as to arrive at the meaning attached to them by those who use them. To ascertain this meaning the compound expression must be taken and n ot its disintegrated parts. I am disposed to think that it means here to convey that a test is p rovided for immigrants depending upon a proper familiarity with some form of speech which in some politically organised European community is regarded as the common means of communication...\"15 The Court held that Scottish Gaelic was not such a \"European language\". Over the long history of the common law there have been fluctuations in the degree of emphasis which the Courts have given to a literal interpreta tion of words on the one hand, and the context, subject matter and purpose of legislation on the ot her hand. We are now in an era where the latter is more frequently determinative than may have been th e case until a decade or two ago. This is particularly the case with respect to the construct ion of general words. Those who would strictly appl y a \"plain meaning\" rule have to recognise that gener al words do not necessarily have a \"plain meaning\".16 Whilst acknowledging changes in the emphasis over t ime, there is nothing new in the application of what is now regarded as the contemporary approach t o construction. As long ago as 1660 the Barons of the Court of the Exchequer said: \"And the judges of the law in all times past have s o far pursued the intent of the makers of statutes that they have expounded Acts which were general in words to be but particular where the intent was particular.\"17 And added: \"... the sages of the law heretofore have construed statutes quite contrary to the letter in some appearance, and those statutes which comprehend all things in the letter, they have expounded to extend but to some things, and those which generall y prohibit all people from doing such an act, they have interpreted to permit some people to do it, an d those which include every person in the letter they have adjudged to reach to some persons only, w hich expositions have always been founded upon the intent of the legislature which they have collected sometimes by considering the cause and necessity of making the Act, sometimes by comparing one part of the Act with another and sometime by foreign circumstances. So that they have ever be en guided by the intent of the Legislature, which they have always taken according to the necessity o f the matter, and according to that which is consonant to reason and good discretion.\"18 This extract from 1660 highlights the significance for any process of construction, of the whole text Page 3 of 12 Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture: Statutory Interpretatio n - Supr ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_23 ... and of the subject matter being dealt with, to prov ide the context within which a particular provision is intended to operate. In the United States the classic application of thi s approach is to be found in a decision of the Unit ed States Supreme Court in 1892. The Church of the Hol y Trinity in New York contracted with an Englishman to come to the Church as its rector and pastor. The issue was whether this violated a Federal statute which made it unlawful for a person to \"assist or encourage the importation or migration of any alien ... under contract or agreem ent ... to perform labour or service of any kind in the United States\". In finding that the contract was no t within the statute the Court said: \"It is a familiar rule, that a thing may be within the letter of the statute and yet not within the st atute, because not within its spirit, nor within the inten tion of its makers. This has often been asserted, a nd the reports are full of cases illustrating its appl ication. This is not the substitution of the will o f the judge for that of the legislator, for frequently words of general meaning are used in the statute, words bro ad enough to include an act in question, and yet a con sideration of the whole legislation or of the circumstances surrounding its enactment, or of the absurd results which follow from giving such a broad meaning to the words, makes it unreasonable t o believe that the legislator intended to include the particular Act\".19 The Court identified the circumstances which led to the passage of the legislation as a concern with the importation of cheap unskilled labour. Hardly a pplicable to a man of the cloth. The Court concluded: \"It is a case where there was presented a definite evil, in view of which the legislature used general terms with the purpose of reaching all phases of th at evil, and thereafter, unexpectedly, it is develo ped that the general language thus employed is broad en ough to reach cases and acts which the whole history and life of a country affirm could not have been intentionally legislated against. It is the d uty of the courts, under those circumstances, to say that, however broad the language of the statute may be, the Act, although within the letter, is not within the intention of the legislature, and therefore can not be within the statute.\"20 Justice Scalia of the United States Supreme Court, has attacked the line of authority which includes the Church of the Holy Trinity case on the followin g basis: \"Congress can enact foolish statutes as well as wis e ones, and it is not for the courts to decide whic h is which and rewrite the former ... Church of the H oly Trinity is cited to us whenever counsel wants u s to ignore the narrow, deadening text of the statute , and pay attention to the life giving legislative intent. It is nothing but an invitation to judicial law mak ing.\"21 Justice Scalia has conducted a long battle against laxity in the process of statutory construction, an d in particular constitutional construction. His crit icisms have been influential in the United States i n a movement labelled \"the new textualism\".22 In many r espects Justice Scalia's approach to statutory construction is bringing the United States approach back to that which applies in Australia and the United Kingdom. His criticism of the Church of Holy Trinity line of cases has not prevailed in the United States. Nor would it do so in Australia. As Mahoney JA has put it: \"It is part of the ordinary process of legislative construction to qualify the generality of words.\"23 In any such process, little assistance can be gaine d from previous cases on different statutes. This i s because: \"Everything depends upon the subject matter and the context.\"24 In 1906 Justice O'Connor in the High Court, immedia tely after his reference to the broader sense of the word \"ambiguity\" referred to above, quoted with approval the following passage from the third edition of Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statute s: \"General words admit of indefinite extension or res triction, according to the subject to which they relate, and the scope and object in contemplation. They may convey faithfully enough all that was intended, and yet comprise also much that was not; or be so restricted in meaning as not to reach all Page 4 of 12 Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture: Statutory Interpretatio n - Supr ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_23 ... the cases which fall within the real intention. Eve n, therefore, where there is no indistinctness or conflict of thought, or carelessness of expression in a statute, there is enough in the vagueness or elasticity inherent in language to account for the difficulty so frequently found in ascertaining the meaning of an enactment, with a degree of accuracy necessary for determining whether a particular case falls within it.\"25 Section 52 of the Trade Practices Act One example of the courts grappling with the applic ation of general words is the delineation of the precise scope of s52 of the Trade Practices Act 197 4 (Cth), and its replication in s42 of the States' Fair Trading Acts. Giving each of the words their f ullest literal meaning would open the prospect of s 52 superseding vast tracks of the law of tort and of c ontract. Such could also supersede a large number of specific statutory provisions. It is not likely that Parliament intended any such results. Neverthe less, the delineation of the boundaries of the applicatio n of the section has proven a matter of some difficulty. In the basic authority in the High Court on this ma tter, the Court divided four/three. The case involv ed an employee who had suffered physical injuries. The Court was unanimous in its conclusion that s52 of the Trade Practices Act did not intend to regulate all conduct of a corporation engaged in fo r the purposes of its trade or commerce. The minority found the relevant restriction in the head ing Part V of the Act with its reference to \"Consum er Protection\". This led to the conclusion, on a textu al basis, that Parliament intended to restrict the protection of the Act to consumers in their capacit y as such. The majority took a different view. The reason expr essed for not permitting the heading of Part V to determine the scope of the general words of s52 was because the Court identified such a construction to be discriminatory. The joint judgment said: \"So to constrict the provisions of s52 would be to convert a general prohibition of misleading or deceptive conduct by a corporation, the consumer or supplier, in trade or commerce, into a discriminatory requirement that a corporate supplie r of goods or services should observe standards in its dealing with a corporate consumer which the con sumer itself is left free to disregard. That being so, the general words of s52 must be construed as apply ing even handedly to corporations involved in a transaction or dealing with one another 'in trade o r commerce'.\"26 The question of discrimination has played a signifi cant role in various aspects of the High Court's recent jurisprudence. What appears to be envisaged in this present context is that the idea of fair dealing lying behind s52 does, as a matter of the p resumed intent of Parliament, require some element of mutuality. The majority identified the source of restriction o f the general words in s52 as arising from the use of the word \"in\", before the words \"trade or commerce\" . Their \"The phrase or commerce' in s52 has a res trictive operation. It qualifies the prohibition against engaging in conduct of the specified type. As a matter of language, a prohibition against engaging in conduct 'in trade or commerce' can be c onstrued as encompassing conduct in the course of the myriad of activities which are not, of their nature, of a trading or commercial character but w hich are undertaken in the course of, or as incidental t o, the carrying on of an overall trading or commerc ial business ... Alternatively the reference to conduct 'in trade or commerce' in s52 can be construed as referring only to conduct which is itself an aspect or element of activities or transactions which of their nature bear a trading or commercial character.\"27 The decision of the Court was that the words bore t he latter meaning. Their Honours concluded: \"Section 52 was not intended to extend to all condu ct, regardless of its nature, in which a corporatio n may engage in the course of, or for the purposes of , its overall trading or commercial business. Put differently the section was not intended to impose, by a side wind, an overlay of Commonwealth law upon every field of legislative control, in which a corporation may stray for the purposes of, or in connection with carrying on its trading or commerci al activities. What the section is concerned with i s the conduct of a corporation towards persons, be th ey consumers or not, with whom it (or those whose interests it represents or is seeking to prom ote) has or may have dealings in the course of those activities or transactions which, of their na ture, bear a trading or commercial character.\"28 Page 5 of 12 Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture: Statutory Interpretatio n - Supr ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_23 ... The Court drew on the words of Sir Owen Dixon in a different context, to conclude that the words \"in trade or commerce\" referred to \"the central concept ion\" of trade or commerce29 and not to the whole range of conduct engaged in in the course of, or fo r the purposes of, carrying on a business. This identifies a boundary, but where that boundary is t o be drawn remains a matter of some difficulty. In Concrete Constructions itself the High Court con cluded that communications between employees as to the safety of the system of work were not \"in trade or commerce\" in the relevant sense. It also gave another example in which a driver carrying fre ight between Sydney and Melbourne who used the indicator lights to suggest the movement of a vehic le in a manner which proved false or misleading, was also not engaging \"in trade or commerce\" in the relevant sense. Clearly the boundary proposed in the majority judgment is more difficult to draw tha n that identified in the minority judgments and so it has proved. The \"side wind\" metaphor has been applied subsequen tly.30 Persons who believed themselves to be depositors in the building societies were not permi tted to rely on s52. The form of the alleged \"deposits\" was non-withdrawable shares. Section 52 was not permitted to supersede the long established procedures for the conduct of a company liquidation. The Court concluded that \"the Trade Practices Act is not concerned to regulate the posi tion as between members of the company and its creditors\". Nor was it intended to eliminate \"the d etailed provisions established for more than a hundred years to govern the winding up of a company \"31. The determination that s52 must be disregarded as a \"side wind\", with respect to a particular body of law, is as difficult as the identification of certa in conduct as falling within the \"central conceptio n\" of trade or commerce. The High Court will revisit thes e issues. Fundamental Rights The most important application of the process of st atutory construction by which words of general application are read down so as not to apply to par ticular factual situations, occurs when a statute impinges on fundamental rights recognised by the co mmon law. As I have said, the protection which the common law affords to the preservation of funda mental rights and liberties is secreted within the law of statutory interpretation. This protection operates by way of rebuttable presu mptions that Parliament did not intend:32 * to invade common law rights; * to restrict access to the courts; * to abrogate the protection of legal professional privilege; * to exclude the right to claims of self incriminat ion; * to interfere with vested property rights; * to alienate property without compensation; * to interfere with equality of religion; * to deny procedural fairness to persons affected b y the exercise of public power. A number of alternative, but equivalent formulation s have been propounded to identify the level of strictness appropriate to construe provisions of th is character: eg \"express words of plain intendment\"33; or or \"clearly whe by words or by necessary implication\"37 or \"with a clearness which admits of no doubt\"38. The basic proposition was well put by Lord Reid: \"There are many cases where general words in a stat ute are given a limited meaning. That is, not only when there is something in the statute itself which requires it, but also where to give general words their apparent meaning would lead to conflict with some fundamental principles. Where there is ample scope for the words to operate without any such con flict it may very well be that the draftsman did no t have in mind and Parliament did not realise that th e words were so wide that in some few cases they could operate to subvert a fundamental principle. I n general, of course, the intention of Parliament c an only be inferred from the words of the statute, but it appears to me to be well established in certain cases that, without some specific indication of an intention to do so, the mere generality of words us ed will not be regarded as sufficient to show an inten tion to depart from fundamental principles.\"39 The High Court has adopted a similar approach in th e six person joint judgment in Bropho, a case concerned with the appropriate test for determining whether an Act is intended to bind the Crown. Page 6 of 12 Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture: Statutory Interpretatio n - of construction' whi ch require clear and unambiguous words before a statutory provision will be construed as displaying a legislative intent to achieve a particular resul t. Examples of such 'rules' are those relating to the construction of a statute which would abolish or modify fundamental common law principles or rights, which would operate retrospectively, which would deprive a superior court of power to prevent an unauthorised assumption of jurisdiction or which would take away property without compensation. The rationale of all such rules lies in an assumption that the legislature would, if it intended to achie ve the particular effect, have made its intention i n that regard unambiguously clear. Thus, the rationale of the presumption against the modification or abolition of fundamental rights or principles is to be found in the assumption that it is 'in the leas t degree improbable that the legislature would overth row fundamental principles, infringe rights, or depart from the general system of law, without expr essing its intention with irresistible clearness; a nd to give any such effect to general words, simply be cause they have that meaning in their widest, or usual, or natural sense, would be to give them a me aning in which they were not really used'.\"40 The last quotation in this passage refers to an ear lier case in which Justice O'Connor had adopted a passage from the fourth edition of Maxwell on Statu tes.41 His Honour also quoted, with approval, the first sentence of the following passage from Maxwel l on Statutes: \"There are certain objects which the legislature is presumed not to intend, and a construction which would lead to any of them is therefore to be avoide d. It is not infrequently necessary, therefore, to limit the effect of the words contained in an enactment ( especially general words), and sometimes to depart not only from their primary and literal mean ing, but also from the rules of grammatical construction in cases where it seems highly improba ble that the words in their wide primary or grammatical meaning actually express the real inten tion of the legislature. It is regarded as more reasonable to hold that the legislature expressed i ts intention in a slovenly manner, than that a meaning should be given to them which could not hav e been intended.\"42 The joint judgment of the High Court in Bropho43 re ferred with approval to the reasoning of Isaacs J i n Ex parte Walsh & Johnson; In re Yates, where his Ho nour said: \"... the full literal intention will not ordinarily be ascribed to general words where that would conf lict with recognised principles that Parliament would be prim a facie expected to respect. Something unequivocal must be found; either in the context or the circumstances to overcome the presumption.\" 44 His Honour had also said in that judgment: \"But once concede the tractability of a phrase, the n the extent of tractability depends entirely on it s surroundings, including extraneous circumstances.\"4 5 One of the presumptions I have listed is the presum ption that Parliament does not intend to restrict access to the Courts. Accordingly where a statute e xpressly includes such a restriction in an \"ouster\" or \"privative\" clause, this presumption operates to require a strict reading of the clause.46 So a sta tute which prevented judicial review of decisions \"under this Act\" would not protect jurisdictional error. The words were not \"under or purporting to be under thi s Act\".47 The right of individuals to approach the Courts to enforce the law, not least to ensure that the executive arm of government exercises its power in accordance with law, is a fundamental right of constitutional significance. Statutes which purport to oust that right will not only be strictly const rued, there is a core content to which the strict constru ction will be applied with stringency. Australian law has developed the Hickman principle. 48 An ouster clause will not save the exercise of a power which is not a bona fide exercise, which do es not relate to the subject matter of the legislat ion or which exceeds the scope of the power on its face . These represent a core content of jurisdictional error to which a stringent standard is appropriate. I have recently held that the obligation to accord procedural fairness is also such a core category.49 There are two general points to make about the circ umstances in which a Court will read down general words in order to protect a fundamental pri nciple. First, the particular principles so protected are w ell known and are so well established, that Page 7 of 12 Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture: Statutory Interpretatio n - Supr ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_23 ... parliamentary draftsmen cannot be in any doubt that they will be applied. Questions are sometimes raised as to whether such a construction by the cou rts is consistent with the proper functions of the courts or represents in some way a failure by the c ourts to reflect the true intention of the legislat ure. No such criticism is warranted with respect to the application of such long established principles of statutory construction. Parliamentary draftsmen kno w that this is the approach that will be taken. If they wish to ensure a particular result, they can d o so by the use of appropriate language. Indeed the contrary is true. As Sir Gerard Brennan has said: \"The authority of the courts to change the common l aw rules of statutory construction must therefore be extremely limited, for the courts are duty bound to the legislature to give effect to the words of the legislature according to the rules which the courts themselves have prescribed for the communication of the legislature's intentions.\"50 The second point to identify is that the categories , to which this approach to statutory construction apply, are not closed. In this, as in every other r espect, the common law is a developing body of principle. The case of Bropho itself concerned the modification of a strict construction with respect to a category to which it had hitherto been applied, nam ely, whether or not a statute bound the Crown. Immediately after the passage I have quoted above, in which the High Court identified the principle as an \"assumption\" that in certain contexts the legisl ature would make its intention \"unambiguously clear\", the High Court added: \"If such an assumption be shown to be or to have be come ill founded, the foundation upon which the particular presumption rests will necessarily be we akened or removed. Thus, if what was previously accepted as a fundamental principle or fundamental right ceases to be so regarded, the presumption that the legislature would not have intended to dep art from that principle or to abolish or modify tha t right will necessarily be undermined and may well d isappear.\"51 The High Court went on to say, that there had been such a change with regard to the issue of whether statutes bound the Crown, by reason of the historic al development of the position of the Crown. However, in acknowledgment of the prior position on which parliamentary draftsmen may very well have relied, the Court distinguished between statut es passed before and after the publication of the decision in Bropho itself. The Court said: \"It must be acknowledged that, in the period since the Province of Bombay case the test of 'manifest from the very terms of the statute' and 'purposes o f the statute being otherwise wholly frustrated' ca me to be established as decisive of the question wheth er, in the absence of express reference the general words of a statute bind the Crown. That being so, i t may be necessary, in construing a legislative provision enacted before the publication of the dec ision in the present case, to take account of the f act that those tests were seen as a general application at the time when the particular provision was enacted. If, however, a legislative intent that the Crown be bound is apparent notwithstanding that those tests are not satisfied, that legislative int ent must prevail. In the case of legislative provisions enacted subse quent to this decision, the strength of the presumption that the Crown is not bound by the gene ral words of statutory provisions will depend upon the circumstances, including the content and p urpose of the particular provision and the identity of the entity in respect of which the question of t he applicability of the provision arises.\"52 The considerations identified in Bropho suggest tha t if a new category of fundamental principle is to be developed, by the usual processes of the common law , then cases involving statutes enacted before the new principle was established may have to be ap proached differently from those enacted thereafter. In addition to the traditional common law examples of what constitutes \"fundamental principles\", there is a new source of authoritative exposition of such principles to be found in the human rights treatie s and conventions to which Australia is a party. They may, in the future, prove to be a fertile source o f authoritative exposition of principles which are us ed to read down general words. Such an approach has long been adopted in the case of private international law. Sir Owen Dixon once said: \"The rule is that an enactment describing Acts, mat ters or things in general words, so that, if restrained by no consideration lying outside its ex press meaning, its intended application would be universal, is to be read as confined to what, accor ding to the rules of international law, administere d or recognised in our courts, it is within the province of our law to effect or control. The rule is one o f Page 8 of 12 Sir Ninian Stephen Lecture: Statutory Interpretatio n - Supr ... 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_23 ... construction only, and it may have little or no pla ce where some other restriction is supplied by cont ext or subject matter. But, in the absence of any count ervailing consideration, the principle is, I think, that general words should not be understood as extending the cases which, according to the rules of private international law administered in our court s, are governed by foreign law.\"53 A similar presumption applies with respect to estab lished doctrines of public international law. As O'Connor J said in 1908: \"Every statute is to be interpreted and applied as far as its language admits as not to be inconsisten t with the comity of nations or with the established rules of international law.\"54 The basic rule is that Parliament is to be presumed to intend to legislate in conformity, and not in conflict, with international law.55 The scope of th e matters within this field may change with time. T his has been the case with subject matter of the kind f ound in international human rights instruments. In a case concerning the possible application of hu man rights conventions, referred to with approval i n subsequent cases, three judges of the High Court sa id: \"We accept the proposition that the Court should, i n a case of ambiguity, favour a construction of a Commonwealth statute which accords with the obligat ions of Australia under an international treaty.\"56 The word ambiguity in this context bears the broade r meaning to which I have referred above, i.e. any case of doubt as to the proper construction of a wo rd or phrase. As Mason CJ and Deane J said in Teoh: \"In this context, there are strong reasons for reje cting a narrow conception of ambiguity. If the language of the legislation is susceptible of a con struction which is consistent with the terms of the international instrument and the obligations which it imposes on Australia, then that construction should prevail. So expressed the principle is no mo re than a canon of construction and does not import the terms of the treaty or convention into o ur municipal law as a source of individual rights a nd obligations.\"57 An express statutory provision has recently been ad opted in this regard in the British Human Rights Act 1998 which incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into the law of the United Kingdom. Section 3(1) of that Act states: \"So far as it is possible to do so, primary legisla tion and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights.\" This provision bears some resemblance to the provis ion in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 which requires the Courts to construe other legisla tion consistently with the protected rights \"wherev er an enactment can be given such a meaning\". No such provision has been introduced into the Inte rpretation Acts of the Commonwealth or the States. There is no reason why, even though human r ights treaties have been ratified by the executive of the Commonwealth government, that a State legisl ature could not establish such a presumption for purposes of its own legislation.58 The reasoning in Teoh suggests that a common law principle to this effect may be emerging.

Speech Night Sydney Boys High School Address by the Honourable JJ Spigelman Chief Justice of New South Wales 16 February 1999 I am the second graduate of Sydney Boys High School to become the Chief Justice of New South Wales. The first was Sir Frederick Jordan. He was t he Chief Justice between 1934 and 1949. Like myself, Sir Frederick Jordan was not born in A ustralia. He was born in London and came to Australia at the age of five. I came at the age of three. He was not the son of privilege. His family lived modestly in Balmain. He attended Balmain Public Sch ool and then Sydney Boys High School. After he graduated from Sydney High he could not afford to g o to university. He worked in the Public Library fo r a number of years before he saved enough money to a ttend university. Thereafter, he completed his studies with the assistance of scholarships. My own career and that of Sir Frederick Jordan, con firms that Australian society has been and remains a comparatively open one. Our careers are p articular manifestations of the ability of this school, by reason of its tradition of selection on the grounds of academic excellence, to make available opportunities to persons from backgrounds which may otherwise restrict such opportunities. The ability to obtain an education which is pitched at a level appropriate to the capacities of partic ular students, is the basis for the equality of opportun ity, to which I have referred. From time to time you will find comments made which characterise the acceptance of excellence in education as in some way \"elitist\". I refute that. My personal experience and that of many other persons who have come from family backgrounds that do not offer any particular privilege, is that excellence in education is the way we have broken t hrough the existing elites. In my opinion, those who would undermine the achiev ement of, or the recognition of, academic excellence in our schools are the true elitists. Fo r they place barriers in the path of those who can overwhelm an entrenched elite. Whilst acknowledging the role this school played in my education, I do not wish to overstate the importance of old school ties. There are persons wh o never seem to graduate from school or from university, and carry throughout their life a speci al addiction to either the old university blazer or the old school tie. I do not wish to downgrade the cont ribution that is made by persons with such an affection for their alma mater, it is just that I d o not share it. I agree with Sir Frederick Jordan who once said: \"Schools and universities are valuable institutions for the training of children and youths in the elements of knowledge. It is good to have passed through them, provided that one has emerged on the other side. To o many regard them as ends, instead of helps towards starting points.\" It is customary on occasions such as this to identi fy some of the challenges or difficulties which lie ahead of you as young men soon to embark on the gre at adventure of adult life. The first thing I wish to say to you is that you should regard your educat ion at Sydney High as a starting point for the futu re. The school makes available to you various opportuni ties. The extent to which you take advantage of those opportunities is a matter for each of you. I do not only refer to the process by which you are equipped to continue your education and to choose y our job and career paths for the future. The opportunities which the school offers encompasses y our involvement in society as whole and your capacity to make a contribution, as we should all i n one way or another make a contribution, as citizens. Furthermore, it encompasses the various s kills and interests of a cultural and sporting Print Page Close Window Page 1 of 2 Speech Night Sydney Boys High School - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_16 ... character by which your future lives will be enrich ed. The school creates opportunities for all of you in each of these respects. Perhaps I may be permitted a few moments of persona l reflection in this regard. My own career has included a number of occasions on which I was invol ved in social activity, unrelated to any job or career path. That started at Sydney Boys High Schoo l. Towards the end of my period at the school, I remem ber the arrival an American exchange student arrived for one year. The school went to quite sign ificant lengths to establish a programme for him: establishing a committee to widen the scope of his activities and of his exposure to the whole of the school community. I realised that there were at the school, a number of students from Asia who were here on what was then known as the Colombo Plan Scheme. Under this s cheme the Commonwealth countries of Asia, then all regarded as underprivileged, sent students for education in Australian high schools and universities. It was an enlightened scheme from whi ch Australia has gained immense advantage in its relationships with Asian nations over the decades. I pointed out to the headmaster that no special arr angements of any character had ever been made by the school for these students, a dozen or so, and t hat this stood in marked contrast with the proposal s for the solitary American exchange student. Accordi ngly, a group of students and teachers got together to form a committee which created a range of new opportunities for interaction between the students from Asian nations at the school and the A ustralian students and teachers. I urge upon you the significance of activity which has a broader civic purpose, beyond the requirements of individual job or career paths. It may be that this was easier for my generation than it is for yours. Unemployment rates were unquestionabl y much lower. Graduate unemployment was virtually unknown. The circumstances have changed. However, what has not changed is the fact that we live in a society which depends for its health a nd stability on the active involvement of its citiz ens. Your own lives will, I assure you, be enriched by s uch involvement. Perhaps I can give you one other example from my ow n career. In 1965, at the very commencement of my third year at university, I was one of the or ganisers of a group at the University of Sydney cal led Student Action for Aborigines which organised in Fe bruary 1965 what was called a \"freedom ride\". This involved a group of students travelling throug h New South Wales' rural areas with the objective o f exposing discrimination against Aborigines in vario us country towns. The discrimination at the time included local gover nment regulations which prohibited Aborigines from swimming in public swimming pools and the practices among various groups, like RSL clubs, which banned even aboriginal ex-servicemen from becoming members of those clubs. This sort of discrimination was widespread at the time. The basic objective of the student group was to exp ose discrimination against Aborigines through publicity. This was particularly successful. It was the first time in Australian history that Aborigin es were front page news for a period of two weeks. I was nineteen at that time. I have done a number o f things since then, most recently my appointment as Chief Justice. However, it may well be that the most important thing I have ever done, was what I did then at nineteen. Time will tell. All of you sh ould be aware that you can make a difference, even at that age. Page 2 of 2 Speech Night Sydney Boys High School - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_16 ... Opening of the Law Term Dinner Chief Justice JJ Spigelman 1 February 1999 (Introductory remarks) From the time of my appointment as Chief Justice, I have on numerous occasions reiterated my belief that the operation of the legal profession, as a pr ofession, performs a vital role in the administrati on of justice. The law is not simply a job or a business focused s olely on maximising the income of its members. The profession of the law has a strong ethical dime nsion and seeks to attain the objectives of justice , truth and fairness, not simply the promotion of the self-interest of members of the profession or thei r clients. As I said at my swearing-in ceremony, I do not inte nd to suggest that venality is unknown in the legal profession, but it is not its central organising pr incipal. A plurality of organising principles for o ur social institutions is as important to the health of our s ociety as bio-diversity is to our ecology. It is appropriate that I reiterate this basic philo sophical perspective on this, the occasion of my fi rst attendance at an Opening of Law Term Dinner. I inte nd to continue to acknowledge the significant role that public service, rather than self-interest, pla ys in the activities of the legal profession. We mu st as a profession resist what appears to be the dominant p erspective in our society that people who put duty and service to the public ahead of self-interest ar e eccentric or, at least, subject to significant su spicion. No sin is more effective in projecting itself on ot hers than the sin of greed. A few months ago I had occasion to sit on a five me mber bench of the Court of Appeal which considered the failure of a legal practitioner to c omply with the rules of the Court for the timeous f iling of submissions and chronologies in the Court of App eal. The unanimous judgment of the Court affirmed the basic principle that legal practitione rs owe duties to the Court, which include a duty to ensure that proceedings before the Court are conduc ted efficiently and expeditiously. It is the existe nce of such duties to the Court which distinguish the p ractice of a profession, from that of business, tra de or a job. The particular duty in question in that case does n ot, as may some other duties to the Court, involve any conflict between the duty to the Court and the duty to the client. The interests of clients is als o to ensure the efficient and expeditious conduct of the ir proceedings. I am pleased to be able to inform you that last yea r I initiated a process of consultation with both t he Law Society and the New South Wales Bar Association on this matter. Each Association nominated two representatives to engage in a dialogue with me , directed to the clarification of the duty to cond uct cases efficiently and expeditiously. As the dialogu e proceeds I expect it will be reflected in changes in the Advocacy Rules and perhaps in other professiona l rules. It may also involve amendment to the Rules of the Court. The objective of this dialogue is to ensure that th e profession and the Courts act cooperatively to enhance the efficiency with which the Courts can us e their limited resources and promote the accessibility of the system of justice by limiting the costs to parties. I look forward to continuing that dialogue. Whilst I do not doubt the significance of steps to improve the efficiency with which the judicial syst em conducts cases before it, some contributions to the debate on this matter do not sufficiently acknowledge qualitative aspects of the judicial pro cess, as distinct from merely quantitative aspects. The fairness of the legal decision making process i s a matter of great social significance. The role o f the judiciary cannot be measured by the extent to w hich it pushes through the maximum number of cases in the shortest period of time. An ardent micro -economic reformer would have noticed that a string quartet performs a work by Mozart Print Page Close Window Page 1 of 3 Opening of the Law Term Dinner - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_01 ... in exactly the same time in 1999 as it was performe d in 1799. There has been no increase in productivity for 200 years. Sure that a great scand al had been discovered, in the form of a collusive arrangement amongst professional musicians, the mat ter would obviously be referred to the ACCC. Some comments on the judicial system disclose a sim ilar approach to life. I wish to associate myself with the analysis of the Chief Justice of Australia, Chief Justice Gleeson in a paper on \"The Future State of the Judicature\" delivered in November of last year. His Honour too k as his central theme the proposition that it is not ap propriate to assess the judicial system as if it wa s merely a publicly funded provider of dispute resolu tion services. I agree with his Honour. We must never lose sight of the fact that the legal system is the exercise of a governmental function, not the provision of a service to litigants as cons umers. The enforcement of legal rights and obligati ons is a core function of government. The first example given by Chief Justice Gleeson is criminal justice. He said: \"The process by which a criminal trial court conduc ts its affairs, including the openness of the proceedings to the public, the insistence upon proper procedure and methods and standards of proof, and the maintenance of a presum ption of innocence, both reflects, and affects, the aspirations and values of the comm unity ... If the only objective of the criminal justice system were the efficient determin ation of the guilt or innocence of accused persons, and the fixing of appropriate puni shments, then the system would operate quite differently. An efficiency expert mig ht conclude that the whole thing could be done much more effectively, and economically, be hind closed doors, without the interference of lawyers and without the impediment of rules and procedures which frequently operate to protect undeserving people. T hat, in fact, is the way in which criminal justice is administered in some places. Bu t our values prevent, and will continue to prevent, such standard prevailing here.\" His Honour referred to the administration of civil justice and emphasised that in that case also, both the substance of the law, and the procedures adopted, r eflect and affect society's values. He added: \"A great body of judge made law has been developed in the course of judicial dispute resolution, and the existence of that law is an imp ortant factor in dispute prevention.\" I agree with Chief Justice Gleeson about the signif icance of published decisions of the superior court s. They enable lawyers to advise their clients of the likely outcome if they pursue a dispute. Even after proceedings are instituted, the vast bulk of civil cases are in fact settled, because the published bo dy of judicial decision is able to be used by the adviser s on both sides to effect a settlement. As Chief Ju stice Gleeson said: \"It can be seen that the social utility of the disp ute resolution activities of Courts extends far beyond the interest to the parties to individua l cases.\" This is a public purpose that is served by the proc ess of resolving a private dispute. The broader pub lic purpose results in social benefits well beyond the resolution of the individual dispute. It is what we economists call an externality. Finally, Chief Justice Gleeson emphasised the const itutional role of the Courts in determining such matters as the powers of governments and parliament s, the enforcement of the rights of citizens, and other ways to maintain the institutional structures of our polity. The judicial system provides a foru m, parallel to our parliamentary system, for the publi c discourse by which our society and polity affirms its core values, applies them and adapts them to changi ng circumstances. The resolution of disputes by the authoritative pro cess of the Courts involves a public affirmation of rights and, often, the social denunciation of impro per behaviour. This is a social role, well beyond t he Page 2 of 3 Opening of the Law Term Dinner - Supreme Court : Lawlink NSW 23/03/2012 http://infolink/lawlink/supreme_court/ll_sc.nsf/vwP rint1/SCO_speech_spigelman_01 ... resolution of a particular dispute. We do not live in a Confucian society in which over riding value is given to the restoration of social harmony. Western civilisation recognises the rule o f law in which people are entitled to assert their rights. In many disputes, some parties are plainly in the wrong and we should not shirk from saying so . There are virtues in resolving disputes for the sak e of doing so - especially where an ongoing relationship is involved. But there are also virtue s in proclaiming that someone is right and someone else is wrong. Nothing I have said should be understood as detract ing from the importance of alternative dispute resolution or the judicial contribution to efficien cy and expedition. There is no doubt that the involvement of the judiciary in the legal process h as changed over recent decades. I am reminded that when Gulliver went to Lilliput he discovered that t he representation of the image of \"Justice\" in Lill iput, was not like our representation in the form of a wo man with a blindfold. In Lilliput, the statue of \"J ustice\" had both eyes firmly open; It also had eyes in the back of the head. This is what we call case management. I have no doubt that the judiciary will, in the fut ure, be even more actively involved in the conduct of litigation. I agree with Chief Justice Gleeson when he said in his November speech: \"The civil disputes function is most likely to unde rgo substantial modification because the cost of performing that function in the manner in w hich it is presently performed is not sustainable.\" The modifications will be multifaceted. They are le ast likely to be made in a context of a grand schem e of reform across the board. A grand scheme is inher ently susceptible to abandoning important changes in order to progress the overall agenda. The most i mportant reforms are often compromised as has, I believe occurred with the Woolf reforms in England. A more patient long term approach is much more likely to lead to substantial change. One of this nation's most abiding characteristics i s its profound scepticism of grand theories. Our political, economic and social development has occu rred by a process of slow, but deliberate, elaboration and evolution of an appropriate legal a nd institutional framework through a process of tri al and error. Throughout our history there has been a recognition of the value of what has been achieved up to that point of time. However this recognition has always been accompanied by a parallel recognition that the established order can and will change: the process of elaboration and evolution is continuing and will continue. I myself am a firm believer in the application of s uch a process to reform of the legal system. I am sceptical of grand schemes for reform which look ne at on a whiteboard. I believe in an ongoing process of change and adaptation. I look forward to a continued association with the Law Society in the progressive development of the legal system of which we are all a part.
