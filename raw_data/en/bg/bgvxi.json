To put these numbers into perspective, in 2011, there were 19 cases of cases of measles in the whole of Wales. Measles can result in pneumonia, loss of hearing, and [death](http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/888/page/66384#i). There are [concerns](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-22731784) that there will be another measles epidemic in the future. One reason for the increase in number of cases of measles is due to a reduced number of children receiving the MMR vaccine. In Wales, the uptake of the MMR vaccine fell from 94% in 1995 to 78% in 2003. It has been [suggested](http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sitesplus/888/page/43749) that this lower uptake of the MMR vaccine was in part due to parents' concerns about a link between the vaccine and autism. It was [also](http://jech.bmj.com/content/54/6/473.full.pdf+html) claimed that a local newspaper had an effect on the lower uptake in Swansea. As it happens, Swansea is my hometown, and I've been working on a project related to vaccine ethics for the past few months. So, the ethical issues raised by the measles epidemic in Swansea are especially interesting for me. In particular, I've been addressing the following two issues. The first issue is whether it is impermissible for parents to refuse the MMR vaccine for their children. The second is whether the parents who refused the MMR vaccine should be blamed for the refusal. The first issue might seem uninteresting. After all, it is uncontroversial to hold that, unless there are other weighty considerations to the contrary, it is impermissible for a parent to allow their child to be harmed. Are there any plausible weighty considerations to the contrary? This is tricky. First off, let's set aside cases where the child has an [allergy](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/downloads/vis-mmr.pdf) to the MMR, and assume that it is permissible to refuse the vaccine in such cases. One possible consideration that could render an MMR refusal permissible is the value of autonomy. Although there are many accounts of what the value of autonomy entails, broadly speaking, it is the idea that it is good to make and act upon significant decisions about one's own life, according to one's own beliefs about what is valuable. Given that a relationship with one's child is a significant part of a person's life, it could be argued that the value of autonomy means that it is permissible for parents to refuse autonomously the MMR vaccine for their child, even though this refusal is bad for their child. However, it seems unlikely that autonomy could render this refusal permissible for a number of reasons. One reason is that it is unclear why the importance of autonomy should outweigh concerns for the health of the child. After all, even if what brings significant meaning to my life involves autonomously planning to punch a stranger in the street, it seems implausible to claim that the value of autonomy renders the action that causes this harm to the stranger permissible. Yet refusing the MMR vaccine could result in far greater harm than my punch (there are, of course, a number of responses to this). A further possible consideration that could render a parent's MMR refusal permissible is the value of the parent-child relationship. As Brighouse and Swift have [argued](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/10.1086/508034.pdf), this value makes a significant contribution to the lives of parents. Moreover, it is argued to be a unique source of flourishing. Nevertheless, it is difficult to see how a parent refusing the MMR vaccine for his/her child could have any bearing on the value of the parent-child relationship. Perhaps it could have some bearing in cases where a parent holds a religious view that forbids vaccines. But even in these cases, it is difficult to see why the importance of realizing this value would outweigh the value of the child's health. So, I think that neither considerations of autonomy nor the value of the parent-child relationship are convincing grounds to claim that it is permissible for parents to refuse the MMR vaccine for their child. There may be other, more persuasive considerations that I haven't mentioned, and if you have any suggestions, let me know. It could be objected that all of these points miss the most important issue about the parents' refusal. It could be claimed that it is permissible for parents to refuse the MMR vaccine for their child if the parents believe that the refusal will be good for the child, even when the refusal will be bad for the child. It is very likely that in the cases where parents refused the MMR vaccine, they did so because they believed that the refusal will be good for their child. There are good [grounds](http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Realm_of_Rights.html?id=ROiaSeFLKQ4C&redir_esc=y) for doubting that a person's beliefs affect the permissibility of his actions, but I don't have space to get into this here (but if anyone knows a compelling argument why beliefs can render otherwise impermissible actions permissible, let me know). However, an agent's beliefs are important when we assess whether a person is blameworthy for their impermissible actions, and it is not clear whether the parents who refused the MMR vaccine are blameworthy. Whether we consider someone to be blameworthy for an impermissible action is important. For example, many philosophers think that it is unjust to punish someone who is not blameworthy for an impermissible action. A sufficient condition for a person not to be blameworthy for an impermissible action is an excuse. If an impermissible action is fully excused, then we should not blame the person who acted impermissibly. Did the parents who refused an MMR vaccine for their child have an excuse? There are a number of conditions that determine whether a person is excused for an impermissible action. Probably the most relevant excusatory condition in this case is ignorance. Suppose that a person does not know that his action has harmful consequences. It is commonly held that this ignorance can excuse this harmful action. So, given that (at least some of) the parents who refused the MMR vaccine did not know that their MMR refusal would result in harm in their child, does this meet the excusatory condition of ignorance? It seems plausible to think that they do meet this condition, and so (at least some of) the parents should be excused and not blamed for refusing the MMR vaccine. (However given the widespread publicity surrounding this epidemic, it is unlikely that future impermissible refusals would meet this excusatory condition). Nevertheless, it could be objected that parents should have known that refusing the MMR vaccine for their child could result in the harm of their child. But this does not seem clear. After all, the parents were faced with a variety of conflicting information concerning the safety of the MMR vaccine, both in a highly respected academic journal, and in their local newspaper. Sadly, there are a number of further responses and objections that I don't have the space here to address, but let me know if you have any thoughts. I would greatly "}
