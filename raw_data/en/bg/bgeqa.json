Experience: Upon arrival, we were greeted with warm smiles and given a soothing seasonal welcome drink at the check-in counter. The therapist then led us to the skincare apothecary-style atelier and performed a thorough 3D facial skin analysis, which scanned deep layers of the user's skin to assess everything from elasticity and fine lines, to degree of UV exposure and moisture levels. During the analysis, the therapist will also recommend skincare solutions based on your skin conditions, and provide answers to your most pressing skincare concerns. Once we laid on the treatment bed in one of the beautifully designed spa suites at Asaya, the facial began with a double cleansing step to gently and effectively remove impurities and every stitch of makeup. EviDenS de Beaut\u00e9's [New Skin Peeling Gel](https://evidensdebeaute.com/en/the-perfecting-saho/93-the-new-skin-peeling-gel.html) was also applied on the T-zone during the cleansing process, which helped to slough off dead cells and pollutant particles from the face, leaving the skin feeling refreshed and smooth. Next, the therapist used [The Moisturising Lotion](https://evidensdebeaute.com/en/the-triple-cleansing-saho/12-the-moisturizing-lotion.html), which comes packed with the brand's exclusive anti-ageing ingredient Triple Collagen\u00ae, to massage the face in pushing and pulling motions, enhancing facial contours and stimulating circulation. For the final step, the therapist applied the [7 Minutes Brightening Anti-Aging Mask](https://evidensdebeaute.com/en/the-brightening-saho/75-the-7-minutes-brightening-anti-aging-mask-box.html) to the face and neck respectively, that worked to deliver essential nourishment and boost collagen production in the deeper layers of the skin. Verdict: The luxurious harbour-facing spa space is a must-visit if you in need of a total escape from the everyday. The overall experience was very relaxing and the results were amazing. Our skin becomes smoother, brightened with pores virtually disappeared after just one session. The effect of the treatment carries on for the next few days, too.
