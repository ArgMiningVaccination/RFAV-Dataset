Admin. Code chs. DHS 35 and/or DHS 75.13 utilizing complementary services and alternative treatment approaches. Complementary and alternative medici ne (CAM) is the term for medical products and practices that are not part of standard care. Standard care is what medi cal doctors, doctors of oste opathy, and allied health professionals, such as nurses, licen sed mental health professional, and substance abuse counselors and other program staff, practice. Complementary medicine is used in conjunction with standard medical Care. Alternative medicine is used in place of st andard medical care. Complementary services and alternative treatment services approaches include such services as Reiki, energy and movement therapies, yoga, meditation, massage therapy, sp iritual guidance, acupuncture, AccuDetox, equine assisted therapy, hypnotherapy, light and color therapies, homeopa thy and dietary consultations. Wellness products and supplements include such items as: books, relaxation CDs, t-shirts, handmade jewelry or woven items, aroma therapy, herbal essen ces, homeopathic medicine and dietary supplements such as vitamins. Background During the past few years, many Certified Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment Programs/ Services have indicated an inte rest and requested guidance in pr oviding integrated complimentary services and alternative treatment approaches fo r their consumers. While the concept is worth considering, some programs have not examined the potential benefits and risks for consumers and potential liability for the program. DQA Memo 16-005 March 10, 2016 Page 2 of 4 The Division of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services (D MHSAS) and Division of Quality Assurance (DQA) staff have identifie d concerns during on-site surveys upon discovery of clinic use of complementary and alternative medicine services. The on-site provider certificat ion visit findings have revealed potential Health Insurance Portability a nd Accountability Act (HIPAA) breaches, a lack of administrative oversight, supervision, policies and pr ocedures; a lack of busin ess associate agreements; unqualified personnel or staff pr acticing without a license. Complementary services and alternative treatment approaches can be successfully implemented in accordance with applicable statut es and regulations, with appropriate thought and preparation. The DMHSAS and DQA strongly encourage pr ograms, who wish to provide th ese services to consult with program's attorney and insurance provider, as well as the program's assigned DQA surveyor prior to the use of complementary services and alternative treatment approaches. DQA survey staff will consult with DMHSAS staff as necessary in reviewing these practices. Guidance Develop policies addressing how complementary se rvices, alternative treatment approaches and wellness products are rendered as part of the overall business plan to meet consumer needs and promote consumer well-being. Develop and implement policies and procedures that identify the selectin of treatment approaches and services that are permitted for use by program staff. Staff qualifications are required for use of specific treatment approaches (e.g., certification in motivational interviewing) and the role of program oversight (i.e., clinical supervision and clinical collabor ation) in treatment approaches. Ancillary services provided by a certified mental health or substance abuse treatment program should be integrated within the assessment and treatment plan. Clearly identify qualified staff members of the program on the staff roster. For example, if a massage or occupational therapist is not a staff member of the program, he/she should not lease space or have an established independent practice within the certified cl inic setting. If someone is a staff member of the program, the program must ensure complian ce with requirements related to orientation and training, clinical oversight, access to confidential treatm ent information, etc. DHS 35.14(1)(a) states, \"The clinic administrator shal l have responsibility for admini strative oversight of the job performance and actions of each staff member and require each staff member to adhere to all laws and regulations governing the care and treatment of consumers and standards of practice for their individual professions.\" C linic policy should describe how this is accomplished. Assure that existing clinic policie s and procedures related to client records adequately address the 'need to know' confidentiality standard as it app lies to complementary service providers. All client records developed as part of service deliver y shall remain in possession of the clinic. Develop informed consent documents to addr ess the potential benef its and risks of the complementary and alternative medicine services. Informed consent per Wis. Admin. Code ch. DHS 94 is an important client educat ion opportunity. Offering products and services may imply that outcomes would be improved; however, this may not be evidenced based. Additionally, offering \"supplem ents\" to food or medication may be contrain dicated due to side e ffects, allergies, and anaphylactic reaction or drug intera ctions. The program may expose itse lf to additiona l liability if DQA Memo 16-005 March 10, 2016 Page 3 of 4 the consumer experiences adverse outcomes. DQA recommends that clinics consider whether CAM or other treatment approaches ha ve been studied and demonstrated safe and effective. Is there evidence by published guidelines of governmental agencies, professional or ganizations or peer- reviewed journals prior to offeri ng services or products to clients. If it has not been studied and demonstrated to be safe, it may be considered expe rimental (i.e., research) and will need to meet the requirements of DHS 94.14 and s. 51.61(1) (j), Stats. 45 CFR 46. Clinics should consider whether CAM services or sale of projects place individuals at risk. Consumers may believe that by providing CAM, certifi ed programs have ensured that these services or products are safe and effective. While most consumers are able to make competent decisions of purchases, some consumers may be an adult-at-risk as defined in Wis. Stats., \u00a755.01 (1e): 'Adult-at- risk' means any adult who has a physical or mental condition that substantially impairs his or her ability to care for his or her needs and who has experi enced, is currently experiencing, or is at risk of experiencing abuse, neglect, self-n eglect or financial exploitation. Consumers should not be charged extra for any products necessary to meet treatment goals. Such costs shall be disclosed as part of the co st of treatment notification under DHS 94.04 (2). Consumer Rights A clinic shall implement written policies and procedures that are consistent with s. 51.61, Stats. and Ch. DHS 94 to protect the rights of consumers. No person may deprive a client of the ability to seek redress for alleged violations of his or her rights. Consumer complaints ca n be filed with the client rights specialist, DQA Behavioral Health Ce rtification section or Office of Caregiver Quality, the Department of Safety and Professional Serv ices (example; complaint of unprof essional conduct against a licensed individual), the U.S. Department of Health a nd Human Services Office of Civil Rights (OCR) for violations of confidentiality unde r HIPAA, or any other federal or state agency organization. If you have questions or are considering implementing an ancillary/complementary service(s) or product sales within a certified clinic, please contact the re gional Health Services Sp ecialist staff assigned to your agency to discuss the business plan or contact the Behavioral Health Ce rtification Section main office at (608) 261-0656 or email, DHSDQAMentalHealthAODA@dhs.wisconsin.gov Additional Resources MedlinePlus, a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine offers additional information and guidance at http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/complementaryandalternativemedicine.html .
