It's safe and effective in combating preventable diseases.", "sitename": "publichealth.org", "date": "2021-07-22", "cleaned_text": "Disease Control (CDC) maintains three schedules for recommended vaccinations: one for children 0-6 years old, another for children 7-18 years old, and a third for adults 19 and older. At first glance, the recommended vaccines can seem like a lot, but many are required to enroll in public schools and colleges, and there is a good reason for each one. See below for a the current CDC vaccination schedules, as well as information on each disease the vaccinations are protecting against. [COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html) An infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This form of coronavirus primarily spreads through droplets of saliva or nostril fluid. - Who should get the vaccine? Available vaccines come in one or two dose options for everyone 12 years and older. The vaccine helps your body develop immunity to the virus, protecting you from getting sick. Check state and local guidelines for vaccination availability in your area. - [Transmission](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html): COVID-19 spreads primarily through droplets released from a person's mouth or nose when breathing, sneezing, or coughing. Inhaling air or small droplets that contain the virus spreads the disease from one person to another. - [Symptoms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html): Some of the most common symptoms include shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, new loss of taste or smell, headache, fever, cough, and body aches. Symptoms range from mild to severe and can appear 2-14 days after transmission. - Prognosis: Although most people with COVID-19 experience mild or moderate symptoms, older adults and people with certain underlying medical conditions may develop serious complications. DTaP This vaccine helps prevent three diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. - Who should get the vaccine? Everyone. A five-dose vaccine is available for children between the ages of two months and six years; teenagers should receive their next DTaP vaccination at age 19, and then every 10 years for the rest of their lives. [Diphtheria](http://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/about/index.html) An airborne infection caused by the Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria. - [Transmission](http://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/about/causes-transmission.html): The disease is spread person-to-person, usually through \"respiratory droplets\" secreted during a cough or sneeze. It may also spread from sores or lesions on the skin, as well as clothing or other items that have been contaminated from the discharge of lesions or sores. - [Symptoms](http://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/about/symptoms.html): Lack of energy, sore throat, fever, and/or swollen neck glands. - [Prognosis](http://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/about/complications.html): Complications from diphtheria include airway blockage, cardiovascular damage, nerve inflammation/polyneuropathy, paralysis, lung infection, and death. One out of ten diphtheria patients who receive treatment do not survive the infection; without treatment, the disease has a mortality rate of 50%. [Tetanus](http://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/about/index.html) An infection caused by the Clostridium tetani bacteria. - [Transmission](http://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/about/causes-transmission.html): The tetanus bacteria lives in the soil, and is transmitted to humans through cuts or burns rendered from physical contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. - [Symptoms](http://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/about/symptoms-complications.html): Headaches, stiff jaw, muscle spasms, body aches, difficulty swallowing, seizures, fever, uncontrollable sweating, and/or increases in heart rate. - [Prognosis](http://www.cdc.gov/tetanus/about/symptoms-complications.html): Complications from tetanus include laryngospasm (involuntary vocal chord contraction), fractured or broken bones, arterial blockage, pneumonia, and difficulty breathing. The mortality rate for tetanus is 10 to 20%. [Pertussis](http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/): An airborne respiratory infection, also known as whooping cough, caused by the Bordetella pertussis bacteria. - [Transmission](http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/causes-transmission.html): The disease is spread person-to-person, usually through respiratory droplets from sneezing or coughing. - [Symptoms](http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/signs-symptoms.html): Runny nose, low fever, mild cough, and apnea, usually appearing one to two weeks after transmission; advanced symptoms include rapid cough, vomiting, and exhaustion. - [Prognosis](http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/complications.html): Although anyone may become seriously ill due to pertussis, infants are especially vulnerable. One in four young victims will develop pneumonia, one in 100 will die, and one in 300 will develop encephalopathy (brain swelling). In teens and adults, some of the most common complications include extreme weight loss, chronic nausea, and rib fractures caused by harsh coughing. [Hepatitis A](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/hepa/default.htm#vacc) The vaccine for an acute viral disease that primarily affects the liver. - Who should get the vaccine? Children between the ages of 12 and 23 months, as well as adults who have experienced liver failure or work in a medical/clinical setting (where exposure to sick people is commonplace) - [Transmission](http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hav/afaq.htm#transmission): Hepatitis A is transmitted through ingestion of fecal matter, usually from person-to-person contact or exposure to contaminated food and drink items. - [Symptoms](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/hepA/in-short-adult.htm#symp): Jaundice of the skin or eyes, fatigue, nausea, and/or loss of appetite; though many carriers remain asymptomatic. - Prognosis: The mortality rate for hepatitis A is relatively low, although liver failure is common among lifelong carriers. [Hepatitis B](http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/b/) The vaccine for an acute liver disease caused by exposure to the hepatitis B virus. - Who should get the vaccine? A three-dose vaccine is available for children that begins at birth and ends at 18 months. Adult vaccinations are recommended for adults who have suffered liver failure or work in a field that commonly involves exposure to sick people. - [Transmission](http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/b/bFAQ.htm#transmission): Hepatitis B may be spread through blood, semen, vaginal fluid, or other bodily liquids; transmission most commonly occurs through sexual intercourse, childbirth (mother-to-child), and sharing of needles, razors, or other instruments that draw blood. - [Symptoms](http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/b/bFAQ.htm#transmission): Fever, body fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, discolored urine, clay-colored stool, joint pain, and jaundice of the skin and eyes; carriers may remain asymptomatic. Only a blood test can confirm a Hepatitis infection. - [Prognosis](http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/b/bFAQ.htm#transmission): Although some people infected with hepatitis B will shed the disease as quickly as six months, others will develop lifelong chronic conditions; generally, younger victims are the most susceptible to developing chronic infections. [Hib: Haemophilus Influenza Type b](http://www.cdc.gov/Vaccines/vpd-vac/hib/default.htm) This vaccine helps prevent meningitis, pneumonia, bacteremia, and other infections caused by the Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria. - Who should get the vaccine?

But as stated above, male and female carriers may develop serious infections (such as cancer) from exposure to HPV. [Influenza](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/index.htm) The vaccination for an airborne infection commonly referred to as 'the flu.' - Who should get the vaccine? Everyone, beginning at birth, should obtain the Hib vaccine on an annual basis. - [Transmission](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm): Influenza is a highly contagious airborne illness caused by the influenza virus, and is spread by exposure to infected individuals who are coughing, sneezing, or simply speaking. - [Symptoms](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/symptoms.htm): Fever (in most cases), cough, runny nose, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and/or headaches. - Prognosis: Most individuals who contract influenza will experience a period of severe sickness that can last up to one or two weeks.
