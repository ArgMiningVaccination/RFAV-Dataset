In these challenging times for our environment, giving back to the earth has never been more important. As a company, our commitment begins with membership in [1% for the Planet](http://onepercentfortheplanet.org/en/)\u2014an alliance of companies dedicated to supporting environmental causes around the world through philanthropy. It's a simple but important pledge to our planet: we must preserve and protect the world around us. This was a great fit for us because Chiropractic is a safe, natural, and non-toxic healthcare that does not put foreign bodies or toxins into the body and has no detrimental impact on the environment. The environment has a huge impact on our health, and we're thrilled to donate 1% of our revenue to organizations that work to preserve and protect the environment. 1% For The Planet As a member company of this renowned organization, True Health Family Chiropractic donates 1% of its revenue to organizations that work to preserve and protect the environment. Founded in 2002 when a handful of Northern California businesses first signed on to support environmental causes, 1% for the Planet has grown to more than 1400 member companies who are financially committed to creating a healthier planet. Member companies contribute 1% of their sales directly to any of the hundreds of non-profit environmental organizations certified by 1% for the Planet. This enables companies to choose those causes they're most passionate about. Dr. Peter Braglia is proud to support the excellent work of this organization, and is pleased to play a role in their global efforts to sustain and protect our natural environment. "}
