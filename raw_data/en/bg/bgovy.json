Traditional cloning workflow consists of four parts as follow: 1. Restriction Digest -\u00ad> 2. End Modification -\u00ad> 3. Ligation -\u00ad> 4. Transformation. To improve cloning efficiency, simple rules were considered during the time of experiment. Before the actual beginning of each experiment the workflow was carefully planned. The attention was placed on the junction sequences and the effect on reading frames of translated sequences. The vector and insert were checked for internal restriction sites. the antibiotic selective marker in the vector compatibility with the chosen host strain was checked. The right concentrations of DNA and its cleanness was tested. Digestion reactions were set really carefully, with a concern of the DNA ends prepared for cloning. The DNA prior to vector:insert joining was cleaned up. Then the isolated material was quantitated. In all processes the manufacturer's guidelines for the joining reaction were followed. The competent cells suited to needs were used. Workflow steps protocols Ligase Buffer Vector DNA (3 kb) Insert DNA (1 kb) T4 DNA Ligase Agar plates with or w/o antibiotic Restriction Enzyme Double Digestion: Reaction set up as follows for single 50 \u00b5L volume final: Reagent Quantities \u00b5L Incubation performed at the PCR machine: o 20 min. in 37C o 20 min. in 80C o Hold in 4C 2. End modification was optional (no methylation). 3. Ligation -\u00ad T4 DNA Ligase: Following reaction performed in a microcentrifuge tube on ice. T4 DNA Ligase added last. 20 of volume Quantities 10X T4 DNA Ligase Buffer 2 \u00b5l Vector DNA (3 kb) 50 ng Insert DNA (1 kb) 50 ng T4 DNA Ligase 1.0 \u00b5L Nuclease-\u00adfree water up \u00b5l T4 DNA Ligase Buffer thawed and resuspended at room temperature. The reaction mixed by pipetting up and down, and briefly microcentrifuged. For cohesive (sticky) ends, sample incubated at 16\u00b0C overnight or room temperature for 10 minutes. For blunt ends or single base overhangs, sample incubated at 16\u00b0C overnight or room temperature for 2 hours (alternatively, high concentration T4 DNA Ligase used in a 10 minute ligation). Chilled on ice and transformed 1-\u00ad5 \u00b5l of the reaction into 50 \u00b5l competent cells. 4. Transformation: Thaw a tube of Competent E. coli cells on ice for until the last ice crystals disappear. Mix gently and carefully pipette 50 \u00b5l of cells into a transformation tube on ice. Add 1-\u00ad5 \u00b5l containing 1 pg-\u00ad100 ng of plasmid DNA to the cell mixture. Carefully flick the tube 4-\u00ad5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex. Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes. Do not mix. Heat shock at exactly 42\u00b0C for exactly 30 seconds. Do not mix. Place on ice for 5 minutes. Do not mix. Pipette 950 \u00b5l of room temperature SOC into the mixture. Place at 37\u00b0C for 60 minutes on rota-\u00admixer. Warm selection plates to 37\u00b0C. Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting. Spread 200 \u00b5l of each sample onto a selection plate and incubate overnight at "}
