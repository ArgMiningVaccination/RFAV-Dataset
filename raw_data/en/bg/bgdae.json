Many people choose to use them and find them helpful. Treatments are usually non-invasive and rarely cause the unpleasant or long-lasting side effects that can be associated with medication. We have midwives who are trained to provide several complementary therapies. Our main services include: - Complementary therapies to stimulate spontaneous labour: Offered to women without certain medical complexities who have gone beyond their estimated due date. During this treatment, a combination of reflex zone therapy and aromatherapy massage will be used to stimulate spontaneous labour with the aim to avoid the need for a medical induction of labour. - Moxibustion: Offered to woman whose baby is in the breech (bottom down) position at or after 34 weeks in pregnancy. Moxibustion naturally encourages a baby to turn from the breech position to a cephalic (head down) position. - Aromatherapy and acupuncture: Available to help with relaxation and to relieve pain during labour. These treatments are free of charge\u2014please speak to your midwife if you'd like to find out more. Please note: We work within safe guidelines, and this includes our complementary therapy service. If you are not suitable for these treatments due to medical or pregnancy-related conditions, you will be advised accordingly.

Aromatherapy Aromatherapy involves the use of plant oils, usually in the form of scented essential oils, to enhance physical and mental wellbeing. Oils can either be used directly on the body (for example, during massage) or with an oil burner so that the scent is carried in the air. Numerous oils may be beneficial during labour to relieve stress, encourage relaxation, act as a uterine tonic and stimulate circulation. The oils we use are: - Clary sage: For lifting spirits and reducing anxiety - Jasmine: Acts as a painkiller and antispasmodic - Lavender: To aid relaxation, promote calm and stimulate healing If you have any questions or concerns about aromatherapy, please ask your doctor or midwife. Acupuncture Acupuncture is a treatment derived from ancient Chinese medicine in which fine needles are inserted at certain points in the body for therapeutic or preventative purposes. Although it is most often thought of as a complementary therapy, it is used in many pain clinics in the NHS. The use of acupuncture during labour has been shown to reduce the intensity of pain and limit the use of other types of pain relief, including epidurals. It is therefore particularly suitable for women who wish to avoid more invasive forms of pain relief. Equally, women who receive acupuncture in labour appear to experience a shorter overall labour and reduced rate of instrumental delivery.
