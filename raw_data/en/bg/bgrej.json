By esoteric healing,\" whatis meant are those systems of beliefs, practices, and teachings onhealth, healing, and medicine that are associated with ancient,hidden, initiatory, and/or extant but nonmainstream spiritualpaths and metaphysical traditions that preserve secret wisdomon transcendental themes. Naturally, this covers an immenseamount of territory; to do this topic justice would require abook-length manuscript. This article intends simply to offer aconcise survey of the health-related features of major esotericsystems, from ancient initiatory traditions of East and West tothe new age movement of the past quarter century. 1Healthcare providers will benet from a basic level of familiarity with thesephenomena, as their concomitant beliefs and practices\u2014espe-cially of the new age variety\u2014have become increasingly acceptedand adopted by a growing segment of the healthcare-consumingpublic, especially in regard to diagnosis and treatment. 2More- over, as will be discussed, many concepts derived from esoterichealing traditions are interwoven throughout the main currentsof complementary and alternative medicine. This article comprises four sections. First, a brief conceptual overview is provided of the esoteric realm. This includes a de-nition of terms and a discussion of the connections and corre-spondences of beliefs and practices within respective esotericsystems of healing and religion. Second, major classes of esotericsystems are reviewed, with an emphasis on the role of medicineand healing within these systems' core teachings. These systemsare discussed within eight general categories: the kabbalistic tra-dition, the mystery school tradition, the gnostic tradition, thebrotherhoods tradition, the Eastern mystical tradition, the West-ern mystical tradition, the shamanic tradition, and the new agetradition. Third, a description is provided of where these healing traditions converge in terms of characteristic features of theirbeliefs and practices. This discussion focuses on issues related toanatomy and physiology; nosology and etiology; pathophysiol-ogy; and therapeutic modalities. Finally, implications of thissurvey of esoteric healing are discussed. These include specicimplications for clinicians, biomedical researchers, and medicaleducators. CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW OF THE ESOTERIC Contemporary religious scholars typically differentiate two gen-eral types of religious expression. One, the outer or exotericpath, comprises forms of expression associated with formal reli-gious institutions and publicly known belief systems. The be-liefs, practices, and trappings of the historic religions and de-nominations constitute exoteric religion. The exoteric is thereligion of Roman Catholic popes, Jewish kippot and tallitot , the Jain tattvas , the Ti- betan Buddhist lineages, organized worship liturgies, congrega-tional prayers and rituals, religious holidays and festivals, dog-mas and doctrines, theological seminaries\u2014in short, the publicface of religion. By contrast, the inner or esoteric religious path represents the mystical, symbolic, hidden, or initiatory way of connecting withGod or the cosmos. Esoteric religion is the stuff of meditation,gnosis, arcane and secretive teachings, gurus, initiation, physicalausterities and exercises, and concomitant mystical, transcen-dent, or unitive states of consciousness. A common observation of both scholars and mystics is that although exoteric religionsmay differ dramatically in their expressions of spirituality acrossthe many \"dimensions of the sacred\" 3\u2014that is, in terms of ritual practices, beliefs, historical myths, cultic activities, sanctionedexperiences, liturgy, sacred architecture, and polity\u2014features oftheir respective esoteric, or inner, paths converge along a com-mon core path. This underlying esoteric meta-path has been denoted with a variety of terms: the \"primordial tradition,\" 4the1 Duke University Medical #Corresponding Author.

All Rights Reserved EXPLORE March/April 2008, Vol. 4, (but not all) exoteric religions seem to possess an esoteric counterpart, not all esoteric paths have an identi- able exoteric counterpart\u2014either now or historically. Esotericspiritual paths do, however, typically have associated with themparticular beliefs and practices related to health, healing, andmedicine. The near universality of this observation perhapsspeaks to the inextricable connection of body, mind, and spiritand a rejection of the modern tendency to conceive of human beings strictly in mechanistic terms. 10Moreover, just as re- spective exoteric religious and medical traditions appear cor-related (eg, the individual-oriented, demystied, rationalizedmaterialism of both mainline Protestantism and allopathicbiomedicine; the nondualism of both contemplative Hinduism and A /H6126yurveda), so too do respective esoteric cosmological and healing systems go hand in hand. Further, just as there appearsto be a \"perennial philosophy\"\u2014a common esoteric spiritualtradition\u2014so it stands to reason that esoteric healing traditionsexhibit common elements. This is explored in the third sectionof this article. The section that follows briefly outlines the health- and med- ical-related beliefs and practices espoused by several categories ofesoteric traditions. These categories are by necessity rather broad(eg, the brotherhoods, shamanic, and new age traditions), andwithin each category passing reference may be made to multipleesoteric systems, which may or may not be historically con-nected. The objective here is not to provide encyclopedic detail,but rather a concise overview of key facts and features, withcitation of helpful sources. MEDICINE AND HEALING IN THE ESOTERIC TRADITIONSAs noted earlier, the term esoteric covers a lot of conceptualground. Several distinct esoteric traditions, or classes of esotericsystems, can be identied. Although in their respective beliefsand concomitant practices and rituals these traditions are notentirely discrete (ie, there is considerable overlap in both historyand content), they tend to self-identify as unique gateways to thehypothetical esoteric realms. This section provides a brief sum-mary overview of the history and most basic principles of thesystems of healing propounded by these major esoteric tradi-tions. The Kabbalistic Tradition The Hebrew word kabbalah means \"tradition\" and refers to the mystical tradition within Judaism. 11The kabbalistic tradition comprises key literary works, such as the Zohar , an esoteric com- mentary on the Hebrew Bible, and the Sefer Y'tzirah , a discourse on metaphysical and numerological features of creation, energy,matter, and higher consciousness, as well as other works bymedieval Jewish mystics. Kabbalah encompasses two mainbranches. Speculative or theoretical kabbalah is concerned withthe nature of God, man, and the universe. This dimension ofkabbalistic exploration is responsible for many esoteric conceptswell known outside of strictly kabbalistic circles: the etz chayyim ,or tree of life; the s'rot , or spherical energy centers connecting the transcendent to the manifested world; the four worlds orplanes of manifestation (known as atzilut ,b'riah ,y'tzirah , and asiyyah and corresponding, roughly, to the familiar causal, men- tal, astral, and physical planes of Theosophy); the sh'khinah ,o r divine presence; the ein sof , or innite void that preceded ation; and the art of g'matria , or scriptural interpretation based upon the numerological identity of the Hebrew letters. Practicalkabbalah emphasizes spiritual practices such as meditation asmeans of mystical union with God. The principles of practicalkabbalah also inform the magickal work of Western occultistsseeking to control and harness the energies of the universe forritual purposes. Although modern Jewish scholars generally con-sider popular writing on the latter as a lurid distortion of kabbal-istic teachings, even \"practically worthless,\" 12it has reached the public eye in recent years through the activities of assorted rockstars and Hollywood celebrities and has contributed to currentmisperceptions of kabbalah. Concurrent with the development of practical kabbalah over the past millennium\u2014and possibly predating it, if traditionalsources are correct\u2014there has risen a stream of Jewish folk med-icine based on equal parts Biblical and rabbinic teachings, on theone hand, and speculative kabbalah, on the other. The encyclo-pedic Biblical and Talmudic Medicine , 13for example, reads like a comprehensive medical textbook, outlining etiologic, patho-physiological, and therapeutic information culled from the To-rah and from Talmudic and Midrashic sources. Contemporaryscholars have taken this material and, armed with insights fromkabbalistic mysticism, have written treatises expounding on hu-man anatomy, 14detailing the healing power of herbs and natural remedies,15and describing the diagnostic or therapeutic efcacy of phenomena such as divination16and alchemy.17Much of this material is attributed to rabbinic scholars, sages, and mystics,including Jewish medieval philosopher-physician Moses benMaimonides, who wrote at length on medical topics. 18Kabbal- istic insights into health, disease, and healing are also accessibleto individuals armed with the requisite knowledge of g'matria to enable identication of the hidden meaning of Biblical texts. 19 Kabbalistic beliefs about health and illness and approaches to healing are central to what Epstein has termed the \"Westernspiritual medical tradition.\" 20Among the seminal contributions of this ancient system of \"Hebraic medicine,\" according to Ep-stein, 21is the idea of \"the bodymind unity\"\u2014the inseparability of body and mind. One cannot even speak of cause and effect whendescribing their interconnection. This is in contrast to othermore recently emergent systems of holistic healing that acknowl-edge linkages between body and mind and attribute illness andhealing to mental or emotional agency, yet still view body andmind as distinct, if connected, entities. This perspective on theessential oneness of body and mind is clearly informed by kab-balistic principles, such as the idea that all manifestation anddifferentiation are the result of a common identity as \"sparks\"emanating from the Creator. The Mystery School Tradition In the few centuries preceding the Common Era, secret cults ofinitiation flowered in the Greco-Roman world, including Egyptand much of Asia Minor. These societies, led by hierophants, 102 EXPLORE March/April 2008, Vol. 4, No. 2 Esoteric Healing Traditionsoffered graded instruction in the divine mysteries that governed both cosmogony\u2014the creation and origins of the universe\u2014andthe spiritual evolution and self-actualization of individual seek-ers. Among the most celebrated schools were those preservingand ceremonializing the Eleusinian, Orphic, and Dionysianmysteries with communal activities, rites, and festivals. 22A com- mon theme of mystery school teachings was that divine revela-tion is accessible to sufciently prepared and initiated suppli-cants or students. Among the most lasting and influentialsources of such revelation was the god-man Hermes Trismegis-tus, a hybrid of the Greek Hermes and the Egyptian Thoth. TheHermetic school was founded to pass along revelations on oc-cult and scientic matters to initiates. 23 In Angus' classic and authoritative work, The Mystery-Reli- gions ,24mystery schools are described as arcane religions emphases on symbolism, redemption, gnosis, emo-tion-inducing sacramental drama, eschatology, personal rebirth,and cosmic interest. For the individual seeking reception by arespective school, candidacy comprised three stages: katharsis ,o r preparation and probation, including the swearing of secretvows; muesis , or initiation and communion, for purposes of beginning the process of regeneration; and epopteia , or experi- ence of an epiphany or theophany, leading to blessedness andsalvation, or even immortality. Initiation was the central act inthis drama, from the individual's perspective, and the fulcrum by which any subsequent knowledge or experience was gained.Specically, initiation into the mysteries sought \"to 'open theimmortal eyes of man inwards': exalt his powers of perceptionuntil they could receive the messages of a higher degree of real-ity.\" 25In practice, this consisted of experiencing a ritual death of the physical body and subsequent resurrection into a new bodywith new capabilities of drawing down gnosis, or secret wisdom,often regarding the functioning of the body itself. 5 (pp136-157) Much of the information received by initiates thus spoke to matters related to normal and pathological physiology and tothe salutogenic process by which pathophysiological statescould be reversed. Nearly all of the ancient civilizations thatsponsored mystery schools (Egypt, Babylonia, Assyria, Phoeni-cia, India, Iran, Greece, and Rome) also hosted a pantheon ofdeities accessible to oracles, priests, and initiates for purposes offacilitating healing. 26Through associated norms and rituals gov- erning interaction and communion with these sources of gnosis,the beliefs and practices promulgated by the mysteries, as far asmedicine was concerned, were ubiquitous and widespread.Across schools, deep fonts of revealed wisdom were availableconcerning how to understand and approach health\u2014one's own,that of another person, and in theory\u2014and how to effect physicalhealing. 27Within the Greek healing cult of Aesclepius, for ex- ample, initiated priest-physicians oversaw great healing templesand shrines, operated medicinal springs, diagnosed and treateddisease through interpreting patients' dreams, and marshaled atherapeutic armamentarium that correlates with what todaywould be termed natural hygiene: fresh air, clean water, sounddiet, and wholesome personal habits. The most famous Aes-clepian initiate was Hippocrates, whose reforms hastened theevolution of medicine from metaphysical to scientic disci-pline. 28The Gnostic Tradition In the couple of centuries before and after the time of Jesus, apair of sectarian religious traditions respectively flourished inthe Holy Land. The Essenes, a minor branch of Judaism, andthe gnostics, a name much later given to a class of Christianheresies, were distinctive and mostly unrelated movements.But they were similar in certain respects and shared somecommon influences. In contradistinction to the nascent rab-binic Judaism of the day, the Essenes were monastic, oftencelibate, communal, pacistic, and vegetarian. According tothe rst-century writings of Josephus, they were believers infate and in the immortality of the soul, stressed the impor-tance of personal righteousness, and \"live the same kind oflife as do those whom the Greeks call Pythagoreans,\" 29one of the mystery schools of antiquity. The Dead Sea Scrolls, acache of manuscripts uncovered between 1947 and 1956, pro-vide a glimpse into the religious and secular life of theQumra /H6126n community, believed to be Essene. Contemporaneously, the discovery in 1945 of about a dozen Coptic codices in Nag Hamm\u00e2di, Egypt, provided access to thebeliefs and practices of various groups of early Christians whoseheterodox views about God, Jesus, and the nature of the worldand of human beings set them apart from the hegemonic Romanchurch. 30Like the Essenes, the gnostics were typically monastic and ascetic, they were contemplative, and they afrmed the possibility of mystical insight into man's higher nature and thenature of God and creation, a gnosis that the early church fatherscould not tolerate. gnostics were character- ized dualistic beliefs\u2014in heaven and hell, good and evil, lightand darkness, body and soul\u2014possibly through exposure to Zo-roastrian influences. 32The combination of mystical, ascetic, and dualistic ideations, especially with respect to the human body,promulgated a vaguely shared perspective on the maintenanceof health and on healing. A possible link between the Essenes and gnostics may be the Therapeutae, a monastic order of healers famously de-scribed Vita Contemplativa . 33The Thera- peutae are thought to be an offshoot of the Essenes who laterestablished themselves near Alexandria, Egypt. Philo's writingpostdated the demise of the sect, and much of what is popu-larly believed about the Therapeutae, especially derived fromcontemporary writings of modern neo-Essene groups, is likelyspeculative at best or apochryphal. 34According to Philo, the Therapeutae resorted to fasting and prayer, were \"devotedwholly to meditation and to the practice of virtue,\" and,signicantly, \"process an art of medicine more excellent thanthat in general use in cities (for that only heals bodies, but theother heals souls).\" 33They were more contemplative the practical Essenes, and their monastic self-reflection is specu-lated to be an influence on the gnostics, whose own sacredwritings contain references to healing that are resonant withpsychodynamic theories and the kinds of inner work charac-teristic of transpersonal and humanistic therapies. The Gos-pel of Thomas, for example, attributes to Jesus the following:\"If you bring forth what is within you, what you have will saveyou. If you do not have that within you, what you do not havewithin you will kill you\" (Saying 70). 35 103 Esoteric Healing Traditions EXPLORE March/April 2008, Vol. 4, No. 2The Brotherhoods Tradition Influenced and informed by the teachings and rites of prior esotericists, especially those originating in the ancient mysteryschools, medieval brotherhoods arose to preserve and transmitthe secret wisdom to generations of initiates. Modern Freema-sonry was revived in 1717 as a lodge of masonic guilds, but itsorigins lie centuries earlier, in the Templar Knights and a streamof other secretive brotherhoods that date back to before theCommon Era. 36The esoteric doctrines of speculative masonry may also have been informed by contact between Templars andIsma /H6126'/H6126l/H6126s, or \"Assassins,\" a proto-Su sect that flourished in Egypt, and elsewhere, from the 11th to 13th centuries. Subse-quent groups evolved out of this lineage, including the Rosicru-cians and various sects and organizations devoted to the study ofalchemy and other occult sciences for purposes of spiritualgrowth and illumination. The brotherhoods were, and are, graded initiatory orders, pre- serving, according to their myths of origin, ancient mysterioso-phy\u2014arcane systems of knowledge, much of which pertains tothe healing arts. Brotherhood teachings have emphasized con-cepts of perfection and balance, attainable through measuredprogress. The Rosicrucians' \"harmonium\" and the Martinists'\"reintegration\" exemplify the centrality of equilibrium andwholism within this world view. The alchemical search for themythic philosopher's stone, said to transmute base metals intogold, was really a quest for enlightenment and immortalitythrough purication of the physical, mental, emotional, andspiritual vehicles and concomitant life energies. So much of thepractical work of alchemists was thus medicinal\u2014preparation ofherbal elixirs to hasten these ends. 37The most the 16th-century Swiss astrologer and occultist Theophras-tus von known as Paracelsus, was also a physicianwhose eclectic Hermetic-influenced theories of illness and heal-ing emphasized the healing power of nature and of natural sub-stances. 38 To achieve and restore an integrated balance, perfection, wholeness, and harmony\u2014in oneself or in others\u2014the broth-erhoods have also practiced more subtle and ethereal forms ofhealing. Among the higher degrees of Rosicrucian initiation isa module of instruction on absent healing through a step-sequential process of clairvoyant diagnosis and distant mentalintention. 39This technique is grounded in concentration, visualization, empathy, humility, and prayer as the most ef-fective way to maintain an open and clear channel to \"theCosmic,\" the source of all being. Interestingly, these sameelements are almost universally acknowledged as essential bycontemporary practitioners of healing at a distance, regardlessof background or training. 40The esoteric orders, according to Dion Fortune, also practiced even more unusual forms ofhealing, including \"a method of healing by substitution, inwhich, by extreme compassion with the suffering of a belovedone, the suffering is experienced in the very self, and then, bythe appropriate reaction and realization, is expiated upon ahigher plane.\" 9 (p39)This procedure is functionally identical to the healing-by-proxy method taught by some contempo-rary subtle energy practitioners.The Eastern Mystical Tradition Concurrently, throughout Asia, transmission of esoteric wis-dom from teachers to students served as a reliable conduit ofhealth-related instruction that drew on both sacred writingsand the influential medical theories of the ancient Greeks.The Indian subcontinent in the rst millennium of the Com-mon Era was an especially fertile region for theoretical spec-ulation and practical application. In his Yoga-Su /H6126tras, a semi- nal text for ra/H6126ja-yoga and the Yoga philosophy generally, the sage Pata\u00f1jali devoted an entire section to the development ofsiddhis , or supernormal powers attainable through advanced meditative practices. 41The efcacy of these techniques was validated for human physiology through the work of Elmerand Alyce Green, of the Menninger Foundation, whose lab-oratory investigations of Swami Rama, a contemporary ra/H6126ja- yogi, showed him capable of voluntarily modulating his brain- wave patterns, creating and dissolving subcutaneous tumorsand cysts at will, and knowingly entering and exiting a 16-second state of atrial flutter. 42 The Sa/H6126nkhya philosophy, another of the six philosophical systems of India, also spawned a body of medical knowledgein the form of A /H6126yurveda, but this school, by now a modern and scientic counterpart to allopathic medicine, must beconsidered exoteric in the present context. 43However, it too has an esoteric counterpart in the many existing theories andtechniques of pranic and bioenergetic healing, also informedin large part by principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine. 44 Buddhism, as well, has an ancient tradition of canonical andnoncanonical writing on matters related both to wellness andillness (regarding determinants of health, suffering, sickness,mental illness, and substance abuse) and to caring and curing(regarding appropriate medical treatments, guidance for care-givers, bioethical decision making, and navigation of life-course transitions, including death). 45Detailed instruction exists on almost every important aspect of health, healing,and medicine throughout the Pa /H6126li, Chinese, and Tibetan Bud- dhist canons. In The Healing Buddha , for example, Birnbaum 46 documents the veritable materia medica found within the Pa /H6126li Buddhist Vinaya-Pitaka : natural and mineral substances such as tallows, roots, astringents, leaves, fruits, resins, and saltsprescribed for conditions ranging from \"wind afflictions\" torheumatism, constipation, itches, boils, sores, eye diseases,jaundice, snakebite, and poisoning. Within Tibetan Buddhism, a sophisticated medical system developed that, although drawing upon earlier Hindu and Bud-dhist therapeutic traditions and sharing elements of the Greekhumoral system, is essentially sui generis. 47The Tibetan system of etiology, diagnosis, and treatment is based on principals out-lined in a fourth-century Indian collection brought to Tibet andtranslated into Tibetan in the eighth century, known as therGyud-bZhi , or Four Tantras. A key etiologic theme is imbalance, which resonates with the traditional Buddhist view that falling out of balance\u2014whether physically, mentally, or spiritually, orthrough succumbing to aggression, desire, or ignorance\u2014is aprimary cause of suffering, a state \"that pervades virtually everyexperience.\" 48 (p153)Imbalances may also occur in the context of a triad of essential elements called chi,schara , and badahan , roughly equivalent to space, energy, and matter, respectively.49 104 EXPLORE March/April 2008, Vol. 4, No. 2 Esoteric Healing TraditionsRestoring balance requires remedying physical symptoms of ex- cess, deciency, and disturbance,50accomplished through various means including virtuous behavior, a natural diet,folk medicinals, and accessory therapies such as massage ormoxibustion. 51Mental health and well-being can fall out of balance, as well, and can be restored through meditative prac-tices that cultivate happiness. 52,53 The Western Mystical TraditionA phenomenon mostly of the past couple of centuries, auniquely Western esoteric tradition has emerged as a repositoryof ancient, arcane learning, both theoretical and practical. Mis-cellaneous kabbalists, modern gnostics, and brotherhoods areoccasionally considered to be part of a Western mystical tradi-tion, so named, but the phrase is more often reserved for non-denominational groups with a strong intellectual emphasis onoccult or metaphysical instruction drawn from amongst theteachings and legends of all of the previously catalogued tradi-tions. Western esotericism, collectively and in contemporaryform, derives its concepts, theories, and practices from kabbalists(especially techniques of practical kabbalah), the mysteryschools (especially with respect to the function of initiation andthe role of adepthood), gnostics (notably the process of seekingand receiving \"illumination\"), the brotherhoods (organization-ally and in their emphasis on preservation of and graded expo-sure to protected wisdom), and Eastern mystics (especially theBuddhist concept of the bodhisattva, or enlightened master,whose guidance is accessible to those who learn how to navigatethe inner planes of consciousness). Theosophy 54and neopagan- ism55constitute two major branches of Western esotericism out- side of the brotherhoods, and much of what has followed has evolved either from Theosophy (eg, the Hermetic Order of theGolden Dawn, the Anthroposophical Society, the Society ofInner Light, the Lucis Trust Arcane School) or from a hybrid of both branches combined with gnostic and/or masonic elements(eg, the Ordo Templi Orientalis and related groups). This is not to say that the Western mystical tradition possesses no original elements. Esoteric groups in the West exhibit, bydegrees, greater Christocentricity, such as among the Anthrop-osophists, and in some respects are simultaneously more sympa-thetic to pagan features of cosmogony, anthropogeny, and the-ories of the human manipulability of matter consciousness.Contemporary craft, or magickal, work\u2014for purposes of healingand otherwise\u2014is strongly influenced by equal parts kabbalisticcosmology and the of ancient emphasizes focused intentionality, afrmation, andmeditative techniques, in keeping with the assertion that physi-cal matter can change in response to the action of the mind orwill. The influence of concepts rst popularized by Theosophists in the late 19th century is widespread, informing most of whatWestern esotericists believe about the multiple planes of exis-tence, the subtle anatomy of human bodies, conscious evolu-tion, karmic justice, reincarnation, and the purpose of life. 56 Theosophists, beginning with H.P. Blavatsky's The Secret Doc- trine57in 1888, introduced the West to a trio of influential con-cepts for the much later birth of holistic medicine: the existence and operation of \"thought forms,\"58the signicance of the chakras for healing,59and the functioning of the \"subtle\" (ie, etheric, astral, and mental) bodies in transducing potentials ofthought and emotion, for example, to the physical body fromthe causal body or eternal \"ego monad.\" 60Other concepts are just as important, notably the seven \"rays\" or human tempera-ments, 61but they have not caught on as widely within contem- porary alternative healing. This terminology is no doubt confus-ing for novices, and Theosophists and their followers haveproduced a cornucopia of writings on esoteric features of health,disease, and healing. 62The Anthroposophists have taken things further, producing a comprehensive philosophy of medical thought and practice based on the prolic teachings of RudolfSteiner. 63Likewise, the esteemed Golden Dawn adept, Israel Regardie, described a system of absent healing combiningprayer, meditation, visualization, and higher attunement thatboth recalls certain techniques of the old initiatory brother-hoods and anticipated and informed the contemporary perspec-tive on noncontact healing. 64 The Shamanic TraditionThe term shaman properly references a hierophant of the indig- enous people of Siberia, Manchuria, and Central Asia, 65yet has come to be adopted as a generic label for medicine people and spiritual healers across a variety of native tribes and culturalgroups. By whatever name, the shaman was/is a kind of high-priest physician of the primordial ur-religions dating to prehis-tory 32and extant throughout parts of North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and Polynesia. It is difcult to generalizeabout belief and practice across such a wide sweep of cultures,yet shamanic traditions are typically characterized by degrees ofanimism, spiritism, polytheism, wholism, and specialized rolellers who access and provide access to the imaginal, or unseen, realms. This is mostly so whether one is referencing Trobriandbaloma spirits, 66Yoruba orisa of other wel-tanschauung, or world views. Across cultures, the shaman regu-lates and ofciates ritual acts that cohere communities of peoplethrough normative understandings of space, time, life purpose\u2014and disease etiology\u2014and provides entr\u00e9e to states of conscious-ness from which an identied \"patient\" may return healed orotherwise restored. Ritual is an essential element here\u2014an \"anti-machine,\" as described by Dagara medicine man Malidoma Pa-trice Som\u00e9, 69that delivers one from the fast-paced outer world to a special place where healing is possible. Throughout these cultural traditions, commonalities among etiologic theories can be observed. A fascinating and compre-hensive anthropological study of records from 139 indigenouscultures, funded by the National Science Foundation in 1969,identied ve theories of natural disease causation (infection,stress, organic deterioration, accident, and overt human aggres-sion) and eight theories of supernatural disease causation (fate,ominous situations, contagion, mystical retribution, soul loss,spirit aggression, sorcery, and witchcraft) which, although notuniversally present, taken together exist as features of the etio-logic understandings of most of these cultures. 70Unlike modern Western medicine, whose practice \"has become increasingly dis- 105 Esoteric Healing Traditions EXPLORE March/April 2008, Vol. 4, No. 2cordant with lay expectations\"71 (p251)on account of its focus on professionally dened diseases (ie, professional notions about abnormalities in bodily organs or systems) rather than on pa-tient-dened illnesses (ie, self-perceived changes in states of be-ing), within indigenous healing systems the actions of the sha-man or native healer have been observed to restore function,enhance affect, and result in highly satised clients, even in theabsence of symptomatic remission. 71The ubiquitous psycho- therapeutic sequelae of shamanic treatment may offer a potentexplanation for these ndings. 72 A closer look at Native-American medicine, in its myriad variations, exemplies these points. Notwithstanding that \"Na-tive American\" masks many varieties, as does \"shaman,\" basicprinciples are observable, principally wholeness. 73The interrela- tion of all things, derived from a single reality, implies a connect-edness that intimately links all manifestation: people, nature,spirits, the life force. Thus, elements of both the natural and super-natural worlds, as well as characteristics internal to individual people, such as thoughts, may function as etiologic factors andas features of the therapeutic armamentarium. Medicine peoplethus have a variety of tools at their disposal: prayer and chanting;music; smudging; herbalism; laying on of hands; psychologicalcounseling; ritual ceremony; and facilitation of inner work suchas fasting and periods of silence. According to Kenneth \"BearHawk\" Cohen, Native-American medicine can be contrastedwith allopathic medicine not just in terms of what each does, butmore importantly, in terms of world view: focus on authoritarian;and so on. 65 The New Age TraditionThe nal category of esoteric traditions to be discussed here is the contemporary conglomeration of beliefs and practices thatgo by the label new age . Much derided and misunderstood, the new age, in its emergence around 30 years ago, was more aquasi-social-movement than an established tradition of esotericlearning and practice. But even that denition does not seem tot. As with medical self-care, a related emergent phenomenon ofthe middle 1970s, the new age does not meet any of the estab-lished sociological criteria for a social movement, namely anidentiable ideology, a sense of common purpose or \"we-ness,\"an established institutional structure or organization, and collec-tive action through developed strategies and tactics. 74According to religious historian J. Gordon Melton, the new age \"has nosingle leader, no central organization, no rm agenda, and nogroup of ofcial spokespersons.\" 75Accordingly, new age healing is a kind of polyglot, drawing elements from every one of theother esoteric traditions, removed from their native contexts,into a chaotic stew, updated and popularized and, some wouldsay, trivialized, for the masses. Qualitative studies have tried totaxonomize the landscape of new age healing. The earliest schol-arly study of the phenomenon, published in 1986, differentiatedbody-oriented therapies for mental or physical self-betterment,mental therapies based on esoteric teachings, and mostly Easternand ritualistic contemplative practices for soul development. 1A subsequent ethnographic study distinguished among Asian-based therapies, synthetic A /H6126yurvedic practices, Euro-American naturalistic medical systems, and healing with mind and spirit.76 An identifying feature of new age healing that separates it from other popular, nonprofessional modes of healing in the West is a reliance upon revealed folk wisdom. By this is meant,heretofore, hidden or altogether new information about health,healing, or medicine that has been \"externalized\" only now, andnot principally through hierophants, adepts, or initiates, butthrough common people, often caught unawares by an unex-pected inspiration. The most familiar means of inspiration isthrough variations of trance channeling, by which a personenters\u2014or is drawn into\u2014an altered state of consciousness andthen becomes a vehicle for a discarnate entity (or, alternatively,one's \"higher self\") to provide information, either for a client orgenerally. The most famous modern channel of health-relatedinformation was the late Edgar Cayce, the famous \"sleepingprophet\" of Virginia Beach, Virginia, who produced over 14,000psychic readings, of which 8,976 touch on medical topics relatedto almost every conceivable disease or condition. 77The Cayce material has generated a sophisticated and multifaceted ap-proach to medical treatment, as well as a unique understandingof human pathophysiology, resulting in a distinctive biomedicalphilosophy and clinical practice style 78as established and rec- ognizable as Anthroposophical medicine or any of the recentEastern imports, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine. Additional channels of health and medical information have gained considerable followings, for example, Louise Hay, whoespouses use of verbal afrmation to de-empower pathophysio-logical mental patterns 79; Elizabeth Clare Prophet, a contempo- rary representative of the mid-20th-century I AM movement andsource for the teachings of the discarnate \"ascended masters\" 80; Caroline Myss, a medical clairvoyant whose capabilities havebeen subjected to empirical study 81; the Course in Miracles, a self-improvement program said to have been dictated to a cou-ple of Columbia University medical professors by the HolySpirit 82; and various well-known practitioners of \"psychic sur- modality with proponents in both thePhilippines 83and Brazil.84Typically, the content of channeled, revealed, or inspired information speaks to the healing power ofmyriad natural substances\u2014gemstones, crystals, color, light,sound, herbs, minerals, animal products\u2014or of alterations toone's mindset and thought patterns. Alternatively, the channelmay exhibit an actual healing gift, such as the \"Mr A\" (real name:Bill Gray) written about by Ruth Montgomery in her bestsellingBorn to Heal . 85To be fair to defenders of mainstream Western medicine, it is not difcult to poke fun at the most marginalexamples of this genre, such as alien contactees. On the otherhand, new age healing may be too easily disparaged. It has servedas a vehicle for introducing a variety of progressive health-relatedconcepts to the public consciousness, including perspectivesand ideas that are now hallmarks of transpersonal and comple-mentary approaches to health and well-being, such as the ther-apeutic potential of intuition, dreams, and extraordinary humancapacities. 86 POINTS OF CONVERGENCEAcross these many esoteric traditions, extensive commonalities canbe seen in characteristic features of their respective teachings about 106 EXPLORE March/April 2008, Vol. 4, No. 2 Esoteric Healing Traditionshealth, healing, and medicine. These include points of convergence in expressed beliefs and/or practices related to (a) anatomy andphysiology, (b) nosology and etiology, (c) pathophysiology, and(d) therapeutic modalities. One caveat: although the terminologyused to language particular concepts may vary dramatically across esoteric systems, the underlying concepts themselves, in manyinstances, appear to be roughly equivalent. For example, theyogic pra/H6126na, the Chinese qi, the naturaeof Hippocrates, and the orgone of Dr Wilhelm Reich all speak tothe idea of a circulating and transpersonal subtle energy, vital lifeforce, or bioeld as a feature of human anatomy. 87,88These convergences and others are described below. Anatomy and Physiology Throughout esoteric systems, a predominant theme is the pres-ence of a \"subtle\" aspect to physical reality that invisibly inter-penetrates the more visible and sensate three-dimensional uni-verse. Concomitant to manifestations of this subtle realm in thenatural environment (eg, the existence of multiple higher dimen-sions, the ever presence of discarnate beings, the activity of\"elemental\" spirits, the reincarnation of souls) are certain fea-tures of human anatomy not currently endorsed by allopathicbiomedicine. These include (a) the presence of several subtlehuman bodies or sheaths, surrounding and interpenetrating thevisible, physical body; (b) the location on, in, or along thesevehicles of powerful vortices or energy centers (eg, the yogicchakras); (c) the existence of a subtle healing energy or vitalforce, mentioned above; and (d) the operation of a functionalsystem of channels that allows the flow of vital life forcethroughout these energy centers and vehicles. Whether fact orction, these four features have become elements of a lingua franca facilitating communication among a wide variety of mod- ern-day esotericists, regardless of tradition. 89 The clearest and most precise elaboration of the structure and interrelated functioning of these four cornerstones of subtle anatomy and physiology in esoteric lore is found in the writingsof the Theosophists. 90Detailed and scholarly dissertations have been published over the past century that carefully differentiatephysical, etheric, astral, mental, and causal bodies; pra /H6126na, and kundalini dimensions of the vital force; and the pathways mapped by the channels of subtle flow (ie, the yogicna/H6126d/H6126s; the meridians of Traditional Chinese Medicine). Under variant names, these concepts can also be identied, explicitly orimplicitly, in the teachings of kabbalists, shamans, initiatorybrotherhoods, Eastern religious systems, Western magick, andcontemporary new age groups of various types. The presence of these anatomical features is signicant for their corresponding physiological functions. Each subtle body,in interface with its respective subtle plane or dimension, bothoriginates and transmutes a particular domain of human psycho-energetic experience. The mental plane is home to \"thoughtforms\" that precipitate down their effects from the mental bodyto the astral body, where they are transformed into emotions;these in turn exert their effects on normal physiology through afurther stepping down through the etheric body, home of thehuman subtle bioelectrical system or aura. The energy centersand channels are the locations on the overall human vehicle where this activity takes place\u2014the centers serving as transducersof the life force, directing it along the channels to points alongthe body which are believed to be in correspondence with par-ticular endocrine glands or organ systems. Nosology and Etiology These understandings of subtle anatomy and physiology haveconsequences for the nosology (taxonomic classication) andetiology (causation) of disease. This is not dramatically differentfrom allopathic biomedicine, where the categorization of both disease entities (eg, epilepsy, colitis) and medical specialties (eg,neurologist, gastroenterologist) follows sanctioned differentia-tions of gross anatomical features (eg, brain, gut) and respectivephysiological functions (eg, autonomic regulation, digestion).Likewise, of causal or antecedent pathogenic fac-tors in both exoteric and esoteric systems is informed by andderived from the presence of bodily or environmental featuresand processes that are believed to be real. For biomedicine, thisincludes biological features of agents (eg, viruses, bacteria), hu-man hosts (eg, immune function, heredity), and physical envi-ronments (eg, toxic exposures). For esoteric systems, this in-cludes a wide array of posited agents and processes: thoughtforms, past-life occurrences, harassment by astral beings, chakraimbalances, disturbances in pra /H6126na flow, the result of karma. 10 Esoteric anatomy and physiology are observed to influence esoteric perspectives on nosology and etiology in two ways. First,esoteric conceptions of human structure and function (and cor-responding features of higher-dimensional influences) can serveas sources of diseases identied according to existing biomedicalnosological categories. For example, the late occultist AliceBailey, founder of the Lucis Trust, a modern esoteric society,attributed accepted disease entities (eg, syphilis, cancer, tubercu-losis) to respective esoteric causal factors such as primordial race(eg, Lemurian, Atlantean, Aryan) and dysfunctions of certainsubtle bodies astral, mental) or energy centers (eg,sexual, solar plexus, throat). 8 Second, etiology may be attributed to disease outcomes or physiological states that exist only in esoteric schemata. Forexample, the late Rudolf Steiner, founder of the Anthroposophi-cal Society, describes as a comorbid feature of influenza themalfunction of the \"sensorium,\" an intracranial organ thatcauses a feeling of dullness in the head when not supplied with arequisite substance. 91Consider also the biblical tzara'at (Leviti- cus 13-14), almost always mistakenly translated as leprosy. Thisis apparently some type of skin disease diagnosable only by akohen (priest) and attributed to spiritual \"uncleanness\" due to the subtle energetic effects of a certain class of sin (believed to be slanderor gossip). This illness is also treated as communicable due to someunspecied contagious mechanism, and infective of both otherpeople and physical structures such as bedsheets and the walls ofhouses. The identity and causes of tzara'at continue to baffle schol- ars. Even the late Dr Julius Preuss, author of the denitive Biblical and Talmudic Medicine , acknowledges that \"the explanation of some of these details is impossible to elucidate.\" 13 (p323) 107 Esoteric Healing Traditions EXPLORE March/April 2008, Vol. 4, No. 2Pathophysiology Not surprisingly, the attribution of etiologic signicanceto esoteric bodily structures and functions requires patho-genic processes that operate according to mechanisms cur-rently unknown to or unaccepted by modern biomedicine.Throughout esoteric systems, innumerable such processes arepostulated and described\u2014far too many to detail here. Threekey concepts, however, emerge repeatedly in esoteric writing:(a) congestion, (b) imbalance, and (c) what might be termedmalec relationship to cosmic forces. According to pathophysiological models espoused within cer- tain mystery school, Eastern mystical, Western mystical, andnew age traditions, disease may manifest as a result of blockage,congestion, or sluggishness in circulation throughout the vari-ous bodily systems. This includes circulation along establishedchannels (eg, arteries, respiratory system, central nervous sys-tem), established but not fully understood channels (eg, lym-phatic circulation, meridians), and the usual subtle energeticchannels. Inflammation, by this perspective, is not a separateand distinctive category of pathogenic sign, but rather a responseto congestion\u2014a sequela of impeded flow of some type withinthese channels and a resultant backing up and stagnation offluids, waste products, or energies. Such an understanding ofpathogenesis can be identied, in part, in the Greek humoralmodel, in traditional Indian and Chinese conceptions of pra /H6126na and chi, and in the therapeutic system developed around thereadings given by Edgar Cayce. Treatment, accordingly, focuseson improving circulation and restoring the flow of energy orfluids to blocked channels and organs, thus reviving andstrengthening exoteric and esoteric bodily structures and sys-tems. This may be achieved through modalities as diverse ascolonics, needling, hydrotherapy, various forms of massage,and, in the Cayce system, use of subtle electromagnetic devicessuch as the \"wet-cell battery\" and \"radio-active appliance.\" 92 Besides congestion of energetic flow, another common theme in esoteric pathophysiology involves the concept of imbalance. Fall-ing out of a state of dynamic equilibrium, at any \"level\"\u2014physical,energetic, emotional, mental\u2014can produce pathophysiological changes leading to manifestations of disease. This perspective iscommonly held throughout the mystery school, brotherhoods,and Eastern mystical traditions, incorporated in concepts suchas the Greek humors and the Rosicrucian idea of harmonium.The main consequence of becoming imbalanced is to increaseone's risk of becoming ill, whether physically or psychologically.This idea has gained considerable contemporary influencethrough its centrality to a variety of complementary and alter-native approaches to health that might not otherwise be consid-ered esoteric. These range from entire schools such as naturo-pathic medicine to particular theories of natural healing. 93 Imbalance can be conceived of either in reference to the constit-uent esoteric and exoteric elements of a single human life or as aphenomenon enlarged to encompass external or environmental influences on health. The latter type of imbalance provides a context for the third concept that dominates esoteric writing on pathophysiology.The cosmic forces spoken of here are not the exoteric type com-monly implied by the word cosmic\u2014seasonal, climatic, atmo-spheric, or geographic influences on health. 94Such factors aredecidedly exoteric, if not yet mainstream in the etiologic or epidemiologic literatures. Rather, within certain esoteric tradi-tions, human beings are believed capable of entering into amalec relationship with forces such as astrological alignments,subtle bioelectromagnetic elds (as detected through dowsing),miasms (or unseen disturbances in the flow of vital life energy),and other elements of \"the unmanifest reality.\" 95These relation- ships are considered here under pathophysiology and not underthe category of etiology, above, because the malec relationshipis not considered as an antecedent or risk factor per se, but ratheras a reflection of an underlying pathogenic state that manifestssimultaneously in the individual and in the particular cosmicphenomenon. This is consistent with the famous alchemicaldictum of \"as above, so below.\" For example, according to aclassic reference, the Encyclopedia of Medical Astrology , leucorrhea is associated with an unfavorable birth chart aspect of Pluto square with the moon 96\u2014not because the latter \"caused\" the former, but because both are mirror reflections of the sameunderlying disturbed reality. For this reason, the identicationof such malec relationships serves a diagnostic function forpractitioners who recognize their \"totemic\" correspondences. Therapeutic Modalities Individual therapies prescribed within esoteric systems rangefrom well-known natural remedies (eg, herbs) to interventionsunique to particular traditions and not easily understandable interms familiar to conventional medicine. It is the latter class ofmodalities that will be described here, as they are more conso-nant, conceptually, with the objective of this paper, namely tosummarize theories and systems invisible to or uninterpretableby prevailing exoteric systems of medicine. In surveying thismaterial, three general categories of therapies can be identied:(a) subtle-energy-based forms of healing, (b) treatment with un-usual gadgets or substances, and (c) interventions involving shifts in consciousness, spiritual states, or one's overall way oflife. Methods of healing based on transmission or manipulation of some form of subtle bionenergy are commonly endorsed bysystems of healing across esoteric traditions. Such energies aresometimes also invoked by alternative but exoteric systems (eg,acupuncture, homeopathy, Therapeutic Touch). Contact andnoncontact methods of subtle energy healing are taught andpromoted within the Eastern mystical, Western mystical, sha-manic, and new age traditions especially. The presumptive salu-togenic value of these techniques, for physical and emotionalhealing, is grounded in an understanding of the pathogenic po-tential of disturbances in human bioenergy elds. 97Across spe- cic schools and philosophies of healing, the healer is typicallyviewed as a conduit of healing, drawing down something\u2014anenergy, pure light, consciousness, spirit\u2014that facilitates the cli-ent's own restoration to equilibrium and wholeness. One inter-esting synthesis of Theosophical, occult, and it terms \"pranic,\" \"telepathic,\" and\"radiatory\" healing. 59A scholarly discussion of the potential mechanisms involved in transpersonally delivered spiritual heal-ing differentiates among \"paraphysical,\" \"energetic,\" and \"mag-netic\" methods of healing. 98The ability to balance internal hu- man energies, or preserve a balance between such energies and 108 EXPLORE March/April 2008, Vol. 4, No. 2 Esoteric Healing Traditionssubtle environmental forces (\u00e0 la \"external qi\"), is a feature of the \"job description\" of myriad esoteric healers, from new age body-workers to initiates of secret orders to Eastern adepts to third-world shamans to present-day kabbalistic and gnostic healers. The widespread existence of hands-on healing modalities throughout the world, across esoteric traditions, utilizing plainlynonuniform methods and ascribing results to widely divergentexplanatory systems, suggests that the efcacy of the healingencounter is not a simple function of technique or skill set. Theessential elements making for efcacious healing encounters,besides a minimum of technical skill, are believed to be found inother features of the transaction between healer and healee. Inone thoughtful model, influenced by Western the \"three D's\": dispassion, discernment, anddetachment. 99Other healers describe similar prerequisites, such as an ability to achieve mental focus and to sense a connection tothe client and to all beings. 100A respected bioenergy practitio- ner, well known by the present author, offers a take most repre-sentative of the perspectives of other healers: successful healingrequires of the healer a single-pointed focus, an ability to set anintention or mental image, and most of all, empathy (L. Mead,personal communication, May, 2007). Identication of empa-thy or compassion as a sine qua non for successful healing isalmost universal among the most accomplished Bruyere,102Olga Worrall,103Jack Schwarz,104and Brugh Joy.105 A second major category of esoteric therapies involves use of highly unusual machines or substances to balance, purify, treat,heal, or cure. Scores of instruments exist, ranging from smallgadgets to large machines, that purport to serve a therapeuticfunction of some kind. Regulation has proved difcult if notimpossible for federal agencies such as the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration, as many of these machines are marketed forrelaxation, spiritual growth, or entertainment, and not explicitlyfor medical intervention. Much of this instrumentation is de-signed to utilize, manipulate, or interface with subtle bioener-gies, so this category of esoteric therapies overlaps somewhatwith the previous one. Examples of popular instrumentationinclude the numerous brain-wave synchronizing light andsound machines, 106radionics and dry flotation tanks and sound tables,110and apparatuses not able to be categorized, constructed from chan-neled or revealed information, such as the devices described inCayce readings 92or electrotherapeutic machines based on Tesla technologies.111 Numerous substances likewise have been promoted as capa- ble of immediate or lasting health effects, for both acute andchronic conditions. Stereotypically new age modalities includeuse of crystals and gemstones arrayed on the ofmagickly potentized liquids or powders; breathing of smokefrom tobacco, incense, or burnt written afrmations; and wear-ing or ritual use of amulets or other sacred objects. It would be a mistake, however, to presume that these methods of healing area solely contemporary phenomenon. Ingestion of unusual nat-ural substances for purposes of healing was characteristic of var-ious civilizations of the ancient world. 112Another \"substance\" promoted as a healing resource is color. Combining the occultprinciple of rays with the yogic chakras and Theosophical subtlebodies, systems of correspondences exist which attribute distinct healing properties to respective frequencies of colored light ap-plied to regions of the body. 113 A third category of esoteric therapies involves the facilitation of shifts in consciousness or in one's spiritual or secular lifestyleas a means of eradicating disease or attaining wellness. Particularmethods of accomplishing such shifts, whether transient or per-manent, typically derive from teachings that are imbued withsacred meaning. Oftentimes such teachings are channeled fromdiscarnate entities. Enormous amounts of health-related self-improvement material has been received from such sources asthe Course in Miracles, the Aquarian Gospel , \"ascended masters\" such as Saint Germain, entities with Native-American-soundingnames (White Eagle, Silver Birch), various competing astralJesuses, and more recently popular new age celebrity channelees(eg, Ramtha, Lazaris, Seth, Emmanuel). Thankfully, insightful,dispassionate overviews of this material exist in print. 114To summarize, these teachings tend to emphasize self-care, focusingon the importance of changing one's perspectives on life, self,and vertical and horizontal relationships as keys to becominghealed and whole. IMPLICATIONS FOR MEDICINE Esoteric approaches to healthcare hold a considerable attractionfor a signicant segment of adult medical patients. Nationalprobability surveys of utilization rates for complementary andalternative therapies, such as the National Health Interview Sur-vey, now typically include items assessing unusual mind-bodytherapies, spiritual practices, and forms of bioenergy healingconsidered somewhat marginal even for alternative medicine. 115 If utilization data are a valid indicator, then perhaps we ought toreconsider the term \"marginal.\" Findings from the 2002 Na-tional Health Interview Survey, for example, identied over twomillion adult Americans who reported a lifetime use of \"energyhealing therapy/Reiki,\" including over one million just in thepast year. The numbers for therapeutic use of guided imagery, qigong, yoga, and ritual prayer were comparable or even higher. New age-oriented beliefs and practices, in particular, have been signicant features of a sort of invisible domain of the folkmedical sector for at least a quarter of a century, especially in theUnited States. This is not dissimilar to the domain of \"invisiblereligions\" spoken of by sociologists 116\u2014privatized expressions of spirituality that exist entirely outside of formal, organized, andinstitutionalized religions and are informed by beliefs drawnfrom sources outside of even unconventional categories of faithtraditions. Although much of what constitutes esoteric healingseems to occupy a realm beyond even established conceptions ofcomplementary and alternative medicine, this realm undeniablyexists. Clinicians, and investigators, who fail to inquire aboutthese types of beliefs and practices therefore risk missing a gooddeal of the therapy-seeking activity of their patients or researchsubjects. By now, primary care providers are familiar with the impor- tance of probing for use of complementary and alternative ther-apies. Younger cohorts of physicians, especially, have exhibited\"a striking degree of interest\" in alternative approaches, bothprofessionally and personally, since the 1980s. 117Assessment of 109 Esoteric Healing Traditions EXPLORE March/April 2008, Vol. 4, No. 2patients' use of established alternative therapies, however, is lia- ble to overlook domains of healing resources much more \"alter-native\" than even alternative medicine. It is not easy to offerrecommendations to clinicians as to how to proceed when thecontent of such approaches is so unusual and the prevalence ofutilization and prole of utilizers have not yet been preciselyidentied. These barriers must eventually be overcome. Manyesoteric beliefs and practices, when existing among particularpatients in parallel to accepted medical care, may be medicallyharmless in and of themselves\u2014especially the more stereotypically new age variety (eg, use of gemstones, channeled information, ritualmeditations). Some may even provide patients with perceived oractual benet. Other more occult involvements, on the other hand,may present real risks, physical and emotional. 118It would behoove family physicians and other primary care providers to get aheads-up on any potentially unusual approaches taken by their clientele, notably those that may interfere with effective conven-tional care. Not surprisingly, most explicitly esoteric approaches to healing are empirically unveried and untested. Perhaps a \"weirdness\" fac-tor prevents alternative-medicine-related research efforts from ex-tending their focus to this domain of health beliefs and practices. If so, this is certainly understandable in light of the ongoingstruggle for legitimacy on the part of complementary and alter-native medical practitioners. It should give clinicians and med-ical scientists considerable pause, however, to recognize that thissame weirdness factor is a potent attractor to legions of patients,whose utilization of unproved new age or other esoteric thera-pies often occurs in isolation and precludes conventional care. Many esoteric approaches to diagnosis and treatment seem to encompass elements that are identical to certain conventional oralternative approaches (eg, phytomedicine, meditation, body-work). Other esoteric approaches are sui generis (eg, clairvoyantor channeled diagnosis, treatment through balancing of chakraenergies). Systematic investigation of salutogenic mechanismswould be provocative and fascinating, to be sure, but may bepremature in light of existing models of explanation. Trials andmedical outcomes studies of clinical efcacy may be more pro-ductive at the present time and are strongly advised. Utilizationstudies conducted by health services researchers are also espe-cially recommended so that the prevalence, patterns, and deter-minants of use may be mapped with greater precision than iscurrently available. Since the beginning of the 1990s, medical and health profes- sions educators have shown a great willingness to expand curric-ula into two previously uncharted and taboo areas: religion andspirituality 119and complementary and alternative medicine.120 Most North American medical schools, for example, now in-clude at least some required or elective coursework on bothtopics. Material related to esoteric healing traditions would seemto fall somewhere in the gray area between these two topics. Thepersistent popularity of new age concepts and therapies, and the considerable interest shown in health beliefs and practices re-lated to shamanic and Eastern mystical traditions, argues forinclusion of these latter topics in surveys and overviews of keyspiritual and alternative approaches to healing. It is easy to crit-icize esoteric healing in general as marginal, and in many in-stances strange, but the importance of these systems and con-cepts for some patients should not be overlooked. Moreover, we ought not refuse to consider the possibility that today's esoterichealing may, in some instances, be tomorrow's scientic medi-cine. 121Equipped with a basic understanding of the origins and constituent features of these traditions, providers will be able tomore fully identify the resources that patients draw on in seekingto improve their health.
