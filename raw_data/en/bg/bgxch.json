In this talk, I'll explain some of the basic evolutionary principles that allows a driving gene to increase in frequency in a population even when it harms the individuals that house it. I'll also discuss two strategies that are now being pursued for using CRISPR gene drives to eradicate malaria. One involves driving to extinction the mosquitoes that spread malaria to humans; the other involves modifying the immune systems of those mosquitoes so that they are less able to spread malaria.| |7 November||Raffaele Danna (History, Cambridge) | The adoption of Hindu-Arabic numerals in England and Italy, a comparative perspective (13th-16th centuries) |While the first introduction in Europe of Hindu-Arabic numerals has been investigated among scholars, the history of their diffusion across the continent is not well known. On the background of the most detailed reconstruction available of the European tradition of practical arithmetic, the paper offers a comparative perspective on the adoption and social circulation of Hindu-Arabic numerals in England and Italy. The comparative approach is justified by the observation that these two societies adopted Arabic mathematics in strikingly different ways. While in England Arabic mathematics was used in scholarly contexts starting from the 12th century, its practical application was still limited at the end of the 16th century. Despite being an early mover, English society proved rather reluctant in adopting the new numeral system. Italian urban societies, on the contrary, introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals in practical contexts from the late 13th century, and started a progressive adoption which made the new symbols widespread across urban social strata from the 15th century. What were the reasons underlying these different patterns? Relying on a vast set of accounting, practical as well as theoretical sources and studying the wider practices and social contexts in which mathematics was used, the comparative analysis allows to identify a complex convergence of factors that allowed for the appropriation of Arabic mathematics in late medieval Italian society as well as for its recombination within a new framework. The novel possibilities opened up by their adoption made the use of Hindu-Arabic numerals a necessary tool for economic activity, triggering their consolidated spread in practical mathematics. It was a contingent, but not random, appropriation of a foreign form of mathematical knowledge. The spread of Hindu-Arabic numerals in England from the 15th century is understood as a reception of the developments that had started on the other end of the continent, opening a perspective on the varying social roles of mathematics across time and space.| |14 November||Wesley Buckwalter (University of Manchester) | Science and the approximation account of knowledge |It is widely accepted that knowledge is factive, meaning that only truths can be known. This theory creates a sceptical challenge. Because many scientific beliefs are only approximately true, and therefore false, they do not count as knowledge. I consider several responses to this challenge and propose a new one. I propose easing the truth requirement on knowledge to allow approximately true, practically adequate representations to count as knowledge. In addition to addressing the sceptical challenge, this view also coheres with several previous theoretical proposals in epistemology.| |21 November||K\u00e4rin Nickelsen (LMU Munich) | Cooperative division of cognitive labour: the social epistemology of photosynthesis research |Historians and philosophers of science have long recognised that the generation of scientific knowledge is a social endeavour, and that traditional epistemologies, which focus on individual scientists, are unable to capture its dynamics. Historians have provided rich accounts of research groups and institutions, although more recently, epistemological questions have received less attention. Philosophers of science, on the other hand, have developed formalised models that are difficult to match with actual historical episodes. In this paper, I argue that an integrated HPS perspective helps to better understand the social epistemologies of scientific collectives. | I flesh out this claim by presenting episodes from the history of photosynthesis research in the late 19th to mid-20th century. In this period, photosynthesis became a subject of great interest for researchers from many different disciplines, while the underlying mechanism remained obscure. I claim that, although the researchers were to some extent competing, their mostly cooperative interactions resulted in a division of cognitive labour that was never formally agreed, but in effect ensured the persistence of a plurality of complementary approaches. By this means, individual scientists improved their own chances of success, while also taking part in the success of others. |28 November||Cancelled| Twentieth Century Think Tank The Twentieth Century Think Tank offers broad coverage of 20th- and 21st-century topics in the history, philosophy and sociology of science, technology and medicine. The regular programme of papers and discussions takes place on Thursdays over lunch. Think Tank meetings are held fortnightly on Thursdays, 1-2pm in Seminar Room 2. All welcome! Organised by Mary Brazelton and Richard Staley. |17 October||Michael Barany (University of Edinburgh) | Making a name in mid-century mathematics: individuals, institutions and the open secret of Nicolas Bourbaki |In 1948, the American Mathematical Society received an application for membership from Nicolas Bourbaki, the pen name of a radical group of French mathematicians then rewriting the foundations of modern mathematics. While that application was quietly dismissed, a second application a year later and the correspondence it provoked together expose significant fault lines beneath the Americans' efforts to lead an international discipline in the wake of World War II. This article draws on a wide range of archival sources to situate Bourbaki's applications amidst the distinctive ways mathematicians established subjective identities in interaction with professional institutions in the mid-20th century. I show how Bourbaki's advocates parodied the period's norms of identification, exploiting newly important ambiguities and challenging newly reconfigured power structures in mathematicians' postwar disciplinary practice. The group's status as an open secret allowed its members to take special advantage of their new disciplinary circumstances while propounding an aggressively transgressive intellectual programme. I close by developing a tension - between individuals and institutions - made more or less explicit in Bourbaki's applications and the responses to it, which sheds new light on recent understandings of subjectivity and embodiment in the history and sociology of modern science.| |31 October||Arathi Sriprakash and Peter Sutoris (Faculty of Education, Cambridge) | The science of childhood: postcolonial development in India, 1950s |In this paper we examine how, in the decade following India's independence, the psychology of childhood became a locus of experimentation, and an avenue through which approaches to postcolonial development were expressed. Tracing the ideas of educational reformers, psychological researchers and child welfare advocates, we show how a 'science of childhood' in this period emphasised both the inherent potential and the emotional complexity of India's young citizens. However, while identifying this potential, these actors at times circumscribed it by deploying culturalist assumptions about Indian childhood that were linked to a teleology of the new nation state. These were ideas that shaped a 'pedagogic' approach to postcolonial modernisation. Nationbuilding was not just a technocratic undertaking, but an educative project that was scientific, spiritual and therapeutic in orientation. We reflect on the need for a greater attention to the pedagogy of the state in analyses of past and present statecitizen relations.| |14 November||Sarah Dillon (Faculty of English, Eliza Effect and Its Dangers': Weizenbaum, Pygmalion and implications of gendering AI |Preface 4 of Douglas Hofstadter's Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models and the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought (1995) is entitled 'The Ineradicable Eliza Effect and Its Dangers'. Hofstadter defines the Eliza effect as an 'illusion', 'which could be defined as the susceptibility of people to read far more understanding than is warranted into strings of symbols - especially words - strung together by computers' (157). More widely, the Eliza effect in computer science names our tendency to unconsciously assume that computer behaviours are analogous to human behaviours, with a consequent effect on our perception of their ontological status. Hofstadter considers this dangerous in its effects because it misrepresents the capacities and capabilities of the research, and the technologies it creates. 'The operational term here is', he says, 'hype', but with an interesting caveat, 'and yet it is', he repeatedly says, 'inadvertent' (167). He acknowledges that it benefits the researchers, but he describes it as merely an 'overly charitable way of characterizing what has happened' (157). For Hofstadter, the Eliza effect is not mal-intentioned, but 'like a tenacious virus that constantly mutates', he says, it 'seems to crop up over and over again in AI in ever-fresh disguises, and in subtler and subtler forms' (158). Hofstadter identifies this phenomenon, but he is doing so as a scientist, in relation to its consequence for scientists and scientific research. What he does not do is think about the social and ethical consequences of the Eliza effect, and about the role of rhetoric in triggering it. In this paper, I explore the Eliza effect in this regard, from a feminist and a literary perspective. The Eliza effect gets its name from the responses to Joseph Weizenbaum's first natural language processing software, ELIZA, which he named after the heroine of George Bernard Shaw's play Pygmalion (1913). Understanding ELIZA's historical and literary origin stories highlights the role of gendering in triggering the Eliza effect, and its feminist dangers. This literary historical case-study can then inform contemporary debate regarding, for instance, the societal harm of the gendering of virtual personal assistants, in particular in relation to such social consequences as the objectification of women, and the replication of gendered models of power and subservience. More broadly, the paper demonstrates the role that literary narratives play in shaping the development, reception and impact of science and technology.| |28 November||Cancelled| Coffee with Scientists The aim of this group is to explore and enhance the interface between HPS and science. Though many of us in HPS engage closely with science and scientists, we could benefit from more explicit discussions about the relationship between HPS and science itself, and from more opportunities for HPS-scholars and scientists to help each other's work. The theme of this term's meetings is 'Philosophy of Science in the Wild'. We host four practising Cambridge scientists from engineering, psychology, zoology and material science, each of whom is engaged in projects with recognisable philosophical components: how to balance different methods (Crilly), how to rank different sources of evidence (Christie), how to implement open and reproducible science (Orben), and how to communicate science (Dolan). We start with a brief presentation of their work before moving on to a relaxed and friendly Q&A. We meet on Fridays, 3.30-5.00pm in Seminar Room 2. Further information and reading materials will be distributed through the email list of the group; please contact Anna Alexandrova (aa686) if you would like to be included on the list. |18 October||Nathan Crilly (Engineering Design, Cambridge) | Pluralism and monism in design fixation research |8 November||Alec Christie (Zoology, Cambridge) | What works in wildlife conservation?

The regular programme of papers and discussions takes place over lunch on Mondays. In addition, the Cabinet organises a beginning-of-year fungus hunt and occasional expeditions to sites of historical and natural historical interest, and holds an end-of-year garden party. All seminars are held on Mondays at 1pm in Seminar Room 1. Please feel free to bring your lunch. Organised by Jules Skotnes-Brown (jasb2). |14 October||Kevin Edwards (University of Aberdeen) | Marginalia in the 'bible' of pollen analysis |The annotation of texts and their study has a long history in literature and the humanities, but less so in science. This talk examines the marginalia within a copy of the first edition of Text-book of modern pollen analysis - the 'bible' of the discipline of pollen analysis (palynology), published in 1950 by two botanists, Knut F\u00e6gri (professor of botany in Bergen) and Johannes Iversen (palaeoecologist with the Danish Geological Survey). | Pollen analysis - the study of pollen grains incorporated in accumulating sediments - is the single most widely used technique in environmental reconstruction. The annotations are the work of 'Mr Pollen Analysis', palynology's evangelist Gunnar Erdtman, a former schoolteacher who went on to develop one of the major research centres for palynology in Stockholm. A further ingredient in a sometimes toxic mix is the 'founder' of palynology, the Swedish geologist Lennart von Post, who had approved of an introductory book by Erdtman and then went on to lavish considerable praise on F\u00e6gri and Iversen's volume. The marginalia display strong feelings, even anger, concerning the contents of the book. They are pedantic, yet can often be shown to confront sloppy writing if not sloppy thinking. They certainly permit an insight into the perspectives of a pioneering scientist as well as revealing a lack of inhibition which might otherwise be hidden. They also reflect an adherence to traditional palaeontological approaches to plant systematics at a time when palynology was being becoming more statistically and conceptually rigorous, addressing ecological problems at scales from the local to the global. |21 October||Paul Sampson (Rutgers University) | The lungs of a ship: labour, medicine and the maritime environment, 1740-1800 |My overall project, 'Ventilating the Empire: Environmental Machines in the British Atlantic World, 1700-1850', investigates the pre-industrial origins of efforts to improve air quality as a measure for preventing the spread of contagious disease. The portion I will present examines the attempt to ventilate and reform the 'close, confined, putrid air' on Royal Navy ships during the mid-18th century. Alarmed at the high mortality rates of sailors, British experimenter and clergyman Stephen Hales (1677-1761) invented new 'ventilators': hand- or wind-powered bellows constructed to mimic the action of human lungs. Required on all Navy ships after 1756, these machines were unpopular with captains and many sailors, but Hales' theories deeply influenced the work of maritime medical experts James Lind, John Pringle and Gilbert Blane, who viewed ventilation as a vital necessity to be cultivated through hygienic discipline. Management of the shipboard environment was fiercely debated in moral terms that cast the clean, well-ventilated ship as the 'nursery' of sailors and the dirty ship as a 'pestilential maw' - an appellation most frequently applied to slave ships. My work will examine how shipboard ventilation played into debates over the use and abuse of labour both in the Royal Navy and the West Indies slave trade.| |28 October||Cabinet Annual Fungus Hunt| |4 November||Nathan Smith (Zoology, Cambridge) | It takes a village: the life and legacy of Henry Thomas Soppitt (1858-1899) |Henry Thomas Soppitt was a greengrocer-turned-drysalter and artisan mycologist whose work primarily focused on discerning the life-cycles of rust fungi. His death on 1 April 1899 was a seminal event in the history of the Yorkshire nature study. Occurring at a critical junction in British mycology, it saw unprecedented response by Yorkshire mycologists to cement his legacy through preservation of his library and herbarium. As time passed, and the fortunes of Yorkshire mycologists continued to decline, there was a continuous return to the work of Soppitt within the community. Focusing on Soppitt's elucidation of the lifecycle of Puccinia bistortae, this paper will explore the significance of the discovery to Yorkshire mycologists and the scientific landscape in which it took place.| |11 November||Matt Holmes (CRASSH, Cambridge) | Hybrid or chimera? Reinterpreting the botanical exchange of William Bateson and Erwin Baur |After several years fighting in defence of Mendelian genetics, William Bateson was appointed Director of the John Innes Horticultural Institution in 1910, where he investigated the development of plant chimeras. Recent scholarship has portrayed this research as something of a misstep by Bateson, which left him out of touch with modern developments in biology, including the chromosome theory of heredity. This paper argues that Bateson's interest in plant chimeras was partly an attempt to address a longstanding controversy in the annals of natural history: the existence, or non-existence, of graft hybrids. Previously unpublished correspondence between Bateson and the German botanist Erwin Baur reveals that Bateson sought to expose graft hybrids as chimeras in order to preserve Weismann's distinction between somatic and germ cells. For his part, Baur helped Bateson to grasp the true nature of plant chimeras and sent him specimens to display at the Royal Society. The timing of this exchange is significant. In Germany, a former debunker of the graft hybrid hypothesis, botanist Hans Winkler, claimed to have created a genuine botanical graft hybrid. In the United States, leading Mendelian William Castle was engaged in a heated exchange with physiologist Charles Guthrie over the existence of animal graft hybrids. Castle portrayed this clash as an attempt by neo-Lamarckians to overthrow both Weismann and Mendel. This wider context revises our picture of Bateson's interest in plant chimeras from that of a scientific misstep to a necessary effort to tackle an immediate threat to the future of Mendelian genetics.| |18 November||Joanne Green (HPS, Cambridge) | 'We the the destroyers': death, emotions and gender in entomology |This paper explores a female entomologist's feelings towards the insects she collected during the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Entomology, ostensibly an exact and objective science, was in actuality filled with emotions, such as the aesthetic joy derived from the beauty and diversity of insects, and the excitement and heightened emotions of the hunt. This paper will place a special focus on the gendered aspects of the relationship between death and natural history, and how entomologists felt about killing insects and turning them into specimens, by focusing on the lepidopterist Margaret Fountaine. Fountaine's entire life revolved around entomology and her collection, but she was also deeply conflicted, and oscillated between the joy of the hunt and the beauty of her captures, and pity and guilt over killing the insects. In her diary she habitually anthropomorphised butterflies and portrayed them as having feelings, while she herself sometimes felt as a murderer for killing them. However, these emotions were repressed in her scientific writing, illustrating one facet of the gendering of emotions among entomologists.| |25 November||Cancelled| |2 December||Cancelled| AD HOC AD HOC (Association for the Discussion of the History of Chemistry) is a group dedicated to the history of chemistry.

Surprisingly, the term 'validator' has never been explicitly defined in the psychiatric literature. Moreover, although lists of different kinds of validators have often been stated, there has been no explicit discussion in the literature about how different kinds of validator evidence should be aggregated in a decision about how to create, revise or remove a psychiatric category. The goal of this paper is to trace the development of the concept of a psychiatric validator, showing how our understanding has changed over time. With this in mind, I evaluate possible recommendations for aggregating validator evidence.| |30 October||Henry Shevlin (Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence) | Theories of consciousness and animal minds: a modest theoretical proposal |The scientific study of consciousness has made considerable progress in the last three decades, especially among cognitive theories of consciousness such as the Global Neuronal Workspace account, Higher-order Thought theory, and Attention Schema theory. Such theories are typically concerned to identify correlates of conscious and unconscious processing in human beings. However, in light of heightened recent interest in consciousness in animals and even artificial systems, a key question for researchers is whether and how we can apply these frameworks to non-human subjects. In this talk, I review the prospects of this endeavour and discuss some challenges. I focus in particular on what I call the Specificity Problem, which concerns how we can determine an appropriate level of fineness of grain to adopt when moving from human to non-human cases. In light of this and other problems, I argue that most theories of consciousness currently lack the theoretical resources to allow for their straightforward application to non-humans. However, I also argue that a purely behavioural approach to non-human consciousness that eschews explicit theoretical considerations is unlikely to give clear answers to some important cases. Instead, I defend what I call a Modest Theoretical Approach, that aims to combine insights from the theories of consciousness debate with data from behavioural ecology, comparative neuroscience, and other sciences of non-human minds.| |6 November||Sahanika Ratnayake (Philosophy, Cambridge) | An appraisal of scientific reasoning as therapy in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy |Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is one of the most popular schools of contemporary psychotherapy. One of the reasons for CBT's success is its ability to present itself as 'scientific'. This claim to scientific legitimacy not only influences how CBT's efficacy is established, but also influences its therapeutic techniques. | Aspects of scientific reasoning and the scientific method are used as part of CBT's arsenal of therapeutic techniques. For instance, clients are encouraged to evaluate problematic thoughts - referred to as 'cognitive distortions' - by testing them as if they were hypotheses. In this paper, I will examine CBT's account of cognitive distortions and the way in which scientific reasoning is used to evaluate and rectify them. I shall suggest that these therapeutic techniques cannot be working in the straightforward manner that CBT claims they are, as they fall afoul of some traditional objections from the philosophy of science. |13 November||Wesley Buckwalter (University of Manchester) | The replication crisis and philosophy |The replication crisis is perceived by many as one of the most significant threats to the reliability of research in cognitive science. Though news of the replication crisis has been dominated by social psychology, all signs indicate that it likely extends to several other fields. This paper assesses the possibility that the crisis and related challenges extend to philosophy. According to one possibility, philosophy simply inherits a crisis by drawing on the same body of questionable evidence as in science. According to another possibility, a crisis is likely to extend to philosophy because philosophers engage in similar practices and structures as those implicated by the crisis in science. Proposals for improving philosophical research are offered in light of these possibilities.| |20 November||Enno Fischer (Leibniz Universit\u00e4t Hannover) | Pluralism about actual causation |In this talk I will suggest a pluralism with regard to actual causation: there is not a single and unified concept but a plurality of concepts of actual causation. The motivation for this pluralism is functional. The concepts need to be distinguished because otherwise they do not facilitate some of their key purposes: intervention and the ascription of responsibility. I will also explore some consequences for theories of causal models.| |27 November||Cancelled| |4 December||Cancelled| The Dialectic The Dialectic is a new, experimental seminar series premised on the notion that the format of a constructive dialogue (not: debate) is uniquely well-suited for the exposition and analysis of novel ideas and unconventional views on the nature of history, philosophy, science and everything in between. Each session shall take the form of a dialogue between a Proponent and an Opponent. The Proponent shall advance a thesis, about which they will be questioned by the Opponent. The Opponent may seek to rebut the Proponent's thesis, defend their own counter-thesis, or simply question the Proponent so as to better understand their reasoning. In the academic year 2019-2020, The Dialectic will be held on a termly basis. For questions, please contact the organiser, Bobby Vos (bfmv2). Tuesday 29 October, 11am, Seminar Room 1 Hasok Chang (proponent) and Tim Lewens (opponent) Thesis: Scientific knowledge is about real objects, which are constrained creations of our minds Aims and Methods of Histories of the Sciences Mondays, 11.30am-1pm, weekly from 21 October (6 sessions) Nick Jardine, with Geoffrey Lloyd, Hasok Chang, Cristina Chimisso, Jeffrey Skopek These graduate seminars will consider aspects of the history, aims, methods and current problems of the history of science. The opening sessions will give an overview of the formation of history of science as a discipline and of the range of recent approaches. Subsequent sessions will discuss uses of histories of the sciences by scientists, the pioneering work of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Metzger on the methods and purposes of history of science, the relations between history and philosophy of science, and historical studies of cross-cultural communication in the sciences. Participants will be invited to offer contributions and to suggest further readings. Science in Print Tuesdays, 3pm-4.30pm, weekly from 29 October (5 sessions) Understanding how the book is made is vital to the study of its contents, helping to locate its economic and social context, its audience, and ultimately its historical significance. Using examples from the Whipple Library's rare book collections, the manuscript holdings of the Parker Library, and the University Library's Historical Printing Collection, this series will explore some bibliographical techniques to identify and describe the structure and production of printed material from the manuscript era through to the hand press period (16th-18th centuries), and consider the uses and abuses of online derivatives. Although the focus will be on scientific texts and illustrations, these sessions will be of interest to book historians in all disciplines, and all are welcome. The sessions on 29 October and 12 November will be in the Old Library; the session on 5 November will be in the Parker Library, Corpus Christi College; and the sessions on 19 and 26 November will be in the Historical Printing Room at the University Library.

The group reads leading social science research in alternation with methodological and philosophical articles. All participants commit to doing the reading each time and to attending all sessions. The session starts with each participant briefly describing their impressions/questions on the reading assigned, after which the chair conducts a discussion on the recurring themes. The meetings take place on Thursdays at 2pm in the Board Room.

Social Epistemology of Science Reading Group This reading group aims to look at some of the important themes in contemporary social epistemology of science - including, but not limited to division of cognitive labour, the mechanisms driving novelty versus conservatism in science, the incentive structures in which scientists are embedded, and the gender productivity gap in scientific research. These themes connect to many issues in integrated HPS, therefore we believe the group will offer a platform for productive intellectual exchange in the Department and beyond.
