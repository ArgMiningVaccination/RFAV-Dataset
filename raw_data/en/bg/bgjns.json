A 1995 nationalsurvey of 10,904 high school students found that 36% of males and 40% of females hadintercourse in the preceding three months. In addition, 21% of males and 14% of females hadintercourse with four or more lifetime partners (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,1996). Given this level of sexual activity, it is not surprising to find that the rate of gonorrheaamong 15- to 19-year-old men in 1991 was 270% greater than the rate among all men and thatthe rate of gonorrhea among 15- to 19-year-old women was 454% greater than the rate among allwomen (Centers for Disease Control, 1993a).African Americans are disproportionately represented among the number of new cases ofgonorrhea and syphilis. Although African Americans account for 13% of the population, theyrepresented 79% of the new cases of gonorrhea and 86% of the new cases of syphilis observed in1995 (Division of STD Prevention, 1996). Thirty-four percent of these new cases of gonorrheaand eleven percent of these new cases of syphilis involved 15-19 year old youth. AfricanAmericans are also disproportionately represented among adolescent and young adult AIDScases. As of July 1, 1997, 35 % of the cases among 13-19 year old and 35% of the cases among20-24 year old men involved African American males; among females, the percentages are 69and 55, respectively (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1997). 2Prevention is especially important in the case of HIV infection because a vaccine isunavailable, and the virus is transmitted by behaviors that individuals can modify (Institute ofMedicine, 1986; Centers for Disease Control, 1988). For sexually active individuals, correct andconsistent condom use currently provides the most effective means of reducing their risk ofinfection (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1993b). Unfortunately, studies suggestthat (male) condom use by adolescents is neither widespread nor consistent. Brown,DiClemente, and Park (1992) found that only 29% of sexually active adolescent males andfemales reported that they used condoms every time they had intercourse; whites were morelikely to be consistent users. In the national study of high school students, only 61% of malesand 47% of females reported condom use at last intercourse (Centers for Disease Control andPrevention, 1996). Rates of condom use were higher among African American students; 72% ofmales and 61% of females reported use at last intercourse. Stanton, Li, Black, et al. (1994)found, in a sample of 9- to 15-year-old African American youth, that 62% used a condom the lasttime they had vaginal intercourse.These results indicate that there is a need for intervention programs that can increase thefrequency of condom use among sexually active African American adolescents, particularlythose who have contracted an STD. The present study reports the immediate (same day),short-term (30 day), and long-term (6 month) impacts of a brief educational intervention on thecondom use knowledge, attitudes, intentions, and self-efficacy as well as sexual and condom usebehavior of black adolescent males seeking treatment at a municipal STD clinic. Theintervention differs in several important respects from similar interventions that have beenreported (Solomon & DeJong, 1986, 1989; Rhodes & O'Donnell et al., 1995; 3Gillmore et al.; 1997). First, the intervention was designed specifically for the target populationand with the assistance of local youth from the at-risk population. We spent several monthsbecoming familiar with this population and its concerns. Second, the intervention was based onthe Self-Regulation model of illness behavior (Leventhal, Zimmerman, & Gutmann, 1984;Meyer, Leventhal, & Gutmann, 1985), the Health Belief model (Becker, 1974; Janz & Becker,1984), and Social Learning theory (Bandura, 1977; 1982). Finally, the intervention messageswere presented by a custom-made videotape or a trained, African American health educator thatused language, showed local settings and portrayed actors in situations that were familiar tomembers of the target population. INTERVENTIONFORMATIVE RESEARCHThere is widespread agreement that health interventions should be tailored to the targetaudience (Solomon & DeJong, 1986; Kelly, 1990; Stevenson & Davis, 1994). Accordingly, weselected our audience, 15- to 19-year-old black males seeking care at a municipal STD clinic, andspent several months engaging in activities intended to increase our understanding of this group.We interviewed public health workers and health care providers who worked at the proposedsite; we sponsored an informal group discussion with black teens who served as peer sexualityeducators for two local programs; and we conducted one-on-one interviews and focus groupswith black male adolescents seeking care at the clinic. With each focus group, we asked aboutthe sexual health concerns and beliefs of local black adolescent males and we listened carefullyto what the young people said and how they expressed themselves. THEORETICAL BACKGROUNDThe Self-Regulation model of illness behavior (Leventhal, Zimmerman, & Gutmann,1984; Meyer, Leventhal, & Gutmann, 1985) provided the basis for our intervention, although wealso used the Health Belief model (Becker, 1974; Janz & Becker, 1984) and Social Learningtheory (Bandura, 1977; 1982) to define the role of perceived risk and perceived efficacy (seeFigure 1). Figure 1 about here The Self-Regulation model assumes that individuals are motivated to protect themselves againsthealth risks. Self-regulation is initiated when individuals extract information from theirenvironment and generate \"common sense\" representations of health threats. In the presentcontext, an individual's common sense representation of gonorrhea may reflect beliefs about itssymptoms, cause, consequences, duration, and cure. In addition, the individual may experienceanxiety or fear. Common sense representations shape the individual's perceptions of personalrisk or vulnerability, and of the threat's severity. In turn, these perceptions and theaccompanying emotions lead to the planning of responses intended to cope with the perceivedthreat.As a theoretical model for an HIV/AIDS prevention intervention, the Self-Regulationmodel has a number of useful features. First, the Self-Regulation model does not assume thatbehavior is strictly determined by rational considerations. In closely related work, Leventhal(1970, 1974, 1982) has argued that emotion and cognition are two independent, but parallelprocessing systems. More importantly, he has argued that it is more difficult to control emotion-driven thought and behavior by means of persuasive appeals because emotion attaches itself 5more readily and more permanently to perceptual cognition than to abstract reasoning. Thus, theproduction and maintenance of behavior change requires an \"emotional hooker\" that makesaction personally reinforcing and meaningful (Gutmann and Meyer, 1981). Sexual behavior, inparticular, may be prompted by emotional needs (Cleary et al., 1986); and thus difficult tochange by simply providing individuals with information about the threats and actions that canbe taken to reduce risk. Second, the Self-Regulation model provides a construct, common senserepresentations, that cm account in part for the variability in individuals' understanding andperceptions of risk. In fact, use of this construct demands that the researcher consider howindividuals view the problem and the actions needed to solve it (Leventhal, Zimmerman &Gutmann, 1984). Third, the Self-Regulation model focuses as much attention on individuals'beliefs about their environment and problem as it does on their beliefs about the efficacy ofvarious actions. The way individuals think about certain health threats and illnesses has beenshown to affect their likelihood of seeking help and their willingness to continue treatment (Lau,Bernard, & Hartman, 1989).VIDEOTAPE DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERISTICSWe worked with a local team of experienced, African American video producers todevelop a videotape that presented messages intended to impact on key variables identified bythe Self-Regulation model (specifically, illness representations, perceived risk, motivationalfactors, and coping). Local, African American, male adolescents participating in a public schoolprogram for students at risk for not completing high school scripted (i.e., expressed theintervention messages using language familiar to adolescents), acted in, and filmed thevideotape. The use of videotape allowed us to present the intervention messages throughdialogue, music, lyrics, images and personal stories. We wanted to use video because we 6believed that it would be an appealing format for adolescents. Also, a videotaped intervention, ifeffective, could be implemented easily at multiple sites.The intervention was developed in light of two time constraints. We had to limit thelength of our contact with study participants so that it did not disrupt normal patient flow. Wewere also aware that there was a limit to the amount of time we could hold the young man'sattention. Expert advice and pilot testing suggested that the intervention should be limited to 15minutes.The videotape had seven characteristics that were intended to enhance its impact.First, we took steps to ensure that it was culturally appropriate (Kelly, 1990; Stevenson & Davis,1994). We conducted interviews and focus groups and then used the knowledge that we hadgained to develop intervention messages that would also reflect our understanding of the relevantprevention research literature. In hiring the local African American video producers, we ensuredthat the video was made by members of the target population; that it used actors, dress, andmusic salient to the target population; and that it used black vernacular English, common to thispopulation. Second, the videotape was presented by persons with whom the recipient couldidentify (Solomon & DeJong, 1989). The actors in the video (as well as the health educator andproject staff in the clinic) were African American and expressed values and beliefs that areimportant to African American adolescents. Third, the videotape elicited feelings of belongingand social responsibility (Fisher & Misovich, 1990). The at-risk youth making the video createdthe message, \"We got to keep the brothers alive.\" Pilot tests of the video indicated thatparticipants responded very positively to this message. Fourth, the videotape addressed thecommon misperception that African American youth are not at risk for STDs/AIDS(Airhihenbuwa, DiClemente, Wingood, & Lowe, 1992). Research has shown consistently that 1 0 7persons who perceive themselves at risk are more likely to engage in protective behaviors(Mc Cusick, 1990). The video intervention included the personal stories of three AfricanAmerican youth: two had contracted gonorrhea and one had AIDS. Fifth, the videotape invokedreference group norms supportive of condom use (Fisher & Misovich, 1990). Reference groupnorms can have a powerful influence on behavior (DiClemente, et al., 1996). Some observershave suggested that African American adolescent peer group norms support unsafe sex(Airhihenbuwa, DiClemente, Wingood, & Lowe, 1992). The video showed African Americanyouth discussing safe sex and condom use as desirable behaviors for themselves and young menlike them. Sixth, the videotape included some skills training (Airhihenbuwa, DiClemente,Wingood, & Lowe, 1992; Langer, Zimmerman, & Cabral, 1994). Because an effectiveintervention should include training in the desired behavior, the video (and health educatorcondition) included a demonstration of the correct way to put on and take off a condom. (In thehealth education condition, the demonstration was followed by having the participant rehearsethese behaviors with a penis model). Finally the videotape presented information in anauthoritative manner (Weisse, Nesselhof-Kendall, Fleck-Kandath, & Baum, 1990). Sourceexpertise is an important aspect of health interventions. The project team included a specialist inadolescent medicine (KKH); and during the production of the video, Robert Hatcher (Hatcher, etal., 1994) met and discussed STD/AIDS prevention with the at-risk youth who scripted, acted in,and filmed the videotape. These steps helped to ensure that the on-camera youth (and the healtheducator) were informed and could speak authoritatively.The major disadvantage of videotape is that the message is the same for each viewer.Although we could tailor the video to the general audience, we could not tailor it to the needs ofa specific individual. Although the videotape used multiple channels (sight, sound) to deliver the 8messages and engage the individual's attention, it cannot (as yet) respond to any question theindividual may have. Consequently, we presented the intervention in a second format thatpermitted face-to-face interaction.HEALTH EDUCATOR INTERVENTIONA trained health educator, a young African American woman, presented the intervention,working one-on-one with the participant. (In addition to her formal training, the health educatorreceived specific training on STDs from clinic staff.) To ensure comparability with thevideotape condition, the script for the face-to-face interaction mirrored the videotape's script, andboth were 14 minutes in length. However, the health educator was expected to tailor theintervention messages to the adolescent's particular situation (i.e., to asked questions, ifnecessary, and thus gain the information needed to personalize the risk for participants). Theface-to-face format also allowed for rehearsal by the client of the recommended preventivebehavior, which was placing and removing a condom from a penis model correctly.OBJECTIVES OF THE INTERVENTIONThe intervention (videotape and health educator) was designed to impact condom use.Our discussions and focus groups, in conjunction with the Self-Regulation model, indicated thatwe needed to:1) make the youth aware that they were at risk of STD/HIV infection; 2) provideaccurate information about condoms; 3) tell them that condom use would reduce their risk; and4) demonstrate to them that condoms are relatively easy to use. A secondary target was to makethe youth aware that they could reduce their risk of contracting an STD by changing their sexualbehavior (i.e., decrease the number of anonymous and/or casual partners and decrease thenumber of contacts). 12 9We expected that the intervention would have an immediate impact on condom useknowledge, self-efficacy, and intentions; and participants' perceptions of their risk for infection.Furthermore, we expected that the health educator would have greater impact because she couldpersonalize the information, and the participant could practice condom use and receiveimmediate feedback. If participants' condom use efforts were successful in the periods betweenthe posttest and 30-day follow-up (and between 30-day and 6-month follow-up), we anticipatedthat the intervention's immediate impact would be sustained. Specifically, short-term effects(effects observed at the 30-day follow-up) were anticipated for condom use attitudes,self-efficacy, and intentions; and condom use and sexual behavior. The 6-month follow-upprovided an opportunity to determine whether effects observed at the posttest and 30-day follow-up were sustained.METHODSPARTICIPANTS AND DESIGNBetween September 1992 and October 1993, we recruited 562 males from the populationof African American males, ages 15 to 19, seeking care at the only STD treatment facilityoperated by the health department in Milwaukee, WI. The study used a three-group, randomized,prospective design with a six-month follow-up. Two of the groups were treatment groups; thethird group was a control group and received the clinic's standard care and education program.Self-report data were obtained using self-administered questionnaire at pretest, posttest, 30 days,and six months.PROCEDUREAn African American male research associate approached each eligible male andexplained the nature of the project. If the young man agreed to participate, the research associateI 3 10obtained written informed consent and then used a block randomization procedure to assign theadolescent to the health educator, the video, or the standard care (control) condition. Next, theparticipant completed the self-administered pretest questionnaire. If the participant had difficultyreading (e.g., the young man had difficulty reading the consent form), the research associateobtained the pretest data via interview. He did so for 18 (3.2%) participants.After completing the pretest questionnaire, the participant returned to the waiting roomwhere the public health nurse working with the project took him to her office and treated him.The nurse took \"standard care\" (control) participants to the research associate who administeredthe posttest questionnaire. She took \"health educator\" participants assigned to the healtheducator who then delivered the intervention. Finally, she took \"videotape\" participants to thehealth educator who took the teen to another office, turned on the VCR, and left the room whilethe participant watched the video. After the health educator/videotape participant received theintervention, the health educator took him to the research associate who administered the posttestquestionnaire.After the participant completed the posttest questionnaire, the research associate gave him25 condoms, reminded him that he would be contacted for a follow-up survey in 30 days, andthanked him for his participation. One-third of the participants, who were selected at randomfrom each condition and prior to their completing the pretest, were reminded that they would becontacted for a six-month, follow-up questionnaire. In addition to 25 condoms, participantsreceived a monetary incentive for the completing the pretest and posttest questionnaires, a $10incentive for completing the 30-day questionnaire, and a $20 incentive for completing the 6-month questionnaires. 14 11INSTRUMENTSThe pretest and posttest questionnaires were designed to assess the intervention'simmediate impact on psychosocial variables such as condom use knowledge, attitudes,self-efficacy, and intentions; and perceived risk of contracting an STD within the year. Inaddition, the pretest obtained data on sexual experience within the preceding 30 days, and pastcondom use during sexual activity with steady and casual partners; and the posttest obtained dataon the estimated frequency of sexual behavior and condom use intentions in the next 30 dayswith steady and casual partners.The 30-day and 6-month questionnaires were designed to assess the intervention's short-and long-term impacts on condom use and sexual behavior. The former obtained data on thenature and number of participants' sexual relationships (steady, casual, both) and contacts(vaginal, anal, oral) within the preceding month. In addition, it assessed condom use knowledge,attitudes, self-efficacy, intentions, and behavior (e.g., talking with others about condoms,obtaining condoms, using condoms with steady and casual partners); and perceived risk ofcontracting an STD within the year. The 6-month questionnaire obtained data on the nature andnumber of participants' sexual relationships within the preceding six months. Further, it assessedcondom use knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, intentions, and behavior; and perceived risk ofcontracting an STD within the year. MeasuresDemographic characteristics. Demographic variables assessed included date of birth,race/ethnicity, educational attainment and aspiration, current living arrangements, currentemployment, marital status, and the number of children they had (fathered). 12Condom Use Knowledge. Six true/false items appearing in several different studies were used.The participant's knowledge score was the number of items answered correctly. Internalconsistency was low (alpha=.13) in part because the items reflect facts important to propercondom use more so than they reflect a common attribute. The items were \"A condom shouldnot be worn with air bubbles at the tip\"; \"You don't need to put the condom on until you areready to come\"; \"It's okay to use vaseline to lubricate condoms\"; \"You unroll the condomcompletely before you put it on\"; \"After you come, withdraw your penis while it is still hard andthen remove the condom\"; and \"Condoms which have a spermicide are better protection againstSTDs and AIDS than other condoms.\"Condom Use Attitudes. Eight, 4-point, Likert-type items were used to assess participants'attitudes toward condom use at the posttest, 30-day, and 6-month (alpha=0.53, 0.60,0.76). Item responses (\"strongly to \"strongly agree\") were averaged to form a condomuse attitude score that ranged from 1 to 4 with larger values indicating more positive attitudestowards condom use. The items were \"Planning ahead to have sex would spoil it for me\";\"Using a condom is unnatural\"; \"Condoms are easily torn or punctured\"; \"You can tell if yourpartner has an STD\"; \"If she is on the pill, you don't need to use condoms\"; \"If my partners wantme to use condoms, they should supply them\"; \"It's too hard to talk to a partner about usingcondoms\"; and \"Condoms cost a lot of money.\"Condom Use Self-Efficacy. Six, 5-point, Likert-type items were used to assess the extent towhich participants perceived that they possessed adequate condom use skills (alpha=.57, .71, .74,.79). Item responses were averaged and scaled to form a score that ranged from -2 (\"very sure Icouldn't\") to +2 (\"very sure I could\"). The six items were \"If you wanted to use a condom everytime you had sex with your steady partner, how sure are you that you could?\"; \"If you wanted to 16 13use a condom every time you had sex with your casual partner, how sure are you that youcould?\"; \"If you wanted to use a condom during sex, how sure are you that you could put it onand take it off correctly?\"; \"If you wanted to tell a new sex partner that you won't have sexwithout a condom, how sure are you that you could?\"; \"How sure are you that you would be ableto convince one of your friends to take precautions to prevent STDs and AIDS?\"; and \"How sureare you that you would be able to get condoms if you or a friend needed them?\"Sexual Relationships. Participants were asked, \"What would you say about your sexualrelationships in the past 30 days?\" Responses were used to group participants according to typeof partner: steady only, steady and casual partner(s), casual partner(s) only, and not seeinganyone.Sexual Behavior. At pretest, participants were asked about their sexual history (age at firstintercourse, lifetime number of sexual partners, and whether they had had sex with another male,sex with a prostitute in the past year, or sex in exchange for drugs in the past year). They wereasked \"How often do you usually have sex?\" Response were scored on an eight-point scaleranging from 1 (\"Only had sex once\") to 8 (\"Every day\"). In addition, participants were asked\"How many different partners have you had sex with in the past 30 days?\" and \"How often didyou have sex in the past 30 days?\" Response choices for the latter item were scored on an eight-point scale ranging from 0 (\"Did not have sex\") to 7 (\"More than once a day\"). For theremaining assessments, comparable items were used to assess participants' sexual behavior(vaginal, oral, anal) in the past 30 days (and next 30 days) for each type of partner with whomthey had been sexually active. Typical items were \"How often did you have vaginal sex withyour steady in the past 30 days?\" Response choices were scored on an eight-point scale rangingfrom 0 (\"Did not have vaginal sex\") to 7 (\"More than once a day\"). 14Condom Use Intentions. At the posttest, 30-day, and 6-month follow-up, participants were askedto estimate how often they intended to use condoms during sex (vaginal, oral, and anal) in thenext 30 days for each partner type with whom they had been sexually active in the past 30 days.A typical item was \"If you have vaginal sex with your steady in the next 30 days, how often willyou use condoms?\" Response choices was scored on an eight-point scale ranging from 0 (\"Willnot use condoms\") to 7 (\"Whenever I have vaginal sex\").Condom Use Behaviors. At pretest, participants asked three yes/no questions: \"Have youever used condoms?\"; \"Did you use condoms the very first time you had sex?\"; and \"Did you usecondoms the last time you had sex?\" They were also asked, \"How often do you use condoms thefirst time you have sex with a new partner?\"; \"How often do you use condoms with your steadypartner?\"; and \"How often do you use condoms with your other partner(s)?\" Response choiceswere scored on a 7-point scale ranging from 0 (\"Never\") to 6 (\"All the time\"). At the pretest and6-month follow-up, participants \"Birth \"When didyou first use condoms?\" Response choices were scored on a five-point scale ranging from 1(\"Less than 1 month ago\") to 5 (\"More than 2 years ago\"). At the posttest, 30-day, and 6-monthfollow-up, we used the condom intention items (with sentence tense changed) to askedparticipants about their condom use in the past 30 days for each type of partner with whom theyhad sex.Perceived Risk. Participants were asked, \"How likely are you to get an STD within the nextyear?\" Response choices were scored on a four-point scale ranging from 1 (\"Not likely at all\") to4 (\"Very Likely\"). Kowalewski, Henson, & Longshore (1997) identify several problems in pastresearch on perceived risk. Our measure and design meet most of the desiderata they identify. 15STATISTICAL ANALYSESTo assess the intervention's immediate impact on condom use knowledge, self-efficacy,and perceived risk, we performed an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the pretest- posttestdifference or change score as the dependent variable. An ANCOVA on change scores isequivalent to an ANCOVA on posttest scores (Huitema, 1980, p 128); however, the former isuseful in that the predicted score is a change score, not a residualized change score. Condition(health educator, HE, videotape, VT, and control, CT) and pretest score were the explanatoryvariables. Bonferroni-adjusted t-tests were used to assess the pairwise mean differences amongconditions. Where noted, we also performed a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) onchange scores.To assess the intervention's short- and long-term impact on condom use attitudes,self-efficacy, and intentions as well as sexual behavior and reported condom use, we used arandom effects model with a main effect for condition, a main effect for time (e.g., pretest,immediate posttest, 30-day, and 6-month), and a condition x time interaction. The randomeffects model allowed us to use all available data (i.e., did not require complete data from allparticipants). Separate analyses were conducted for each variable. Bonferroni-adjusted z-testswere used to assess the pairwise mean differences associated with the main effects; they werealso used to conduct simple effects tests and single degree-of-freedom contrasts. All analyseswere initially performed on a PC running the DOS version of SYSTAT (Wilkinson, 1990);calculation of Cronbach's alpha and random effects modeling was performed using STATA v5.0(Stata Corp, 1997). 16RESULTSBASELINE CHARACTERISTICSThe mean age was 18.3 years (sd=1.2); fifty percent of the participants were between theages of 17.5 and 19.2. Table 1 describes additional demographic characteristics. Twenty-eightpercent were one or more years below their expected grade level (based on age). Ten percent ofthe participants' mothers had less than 10 years of schooling; 33.4% had Table 1 about here completed high school; 37.4% had some college, a college degree, or post-collegiate education;and 18.7% did not know how much education their mother had. The educational attainmentreported for fathers was comparable to that reported for mothers.Almost all of the participants were single. On average, each participants lived with 3.4(sd=1.9) other individuals. Most lived with one or both parents. Twenty-nine participants livedwith their partner and two of the five married men lived with their spouse.The mean age at first intercourse was 12.9 years (sd=2.3, range = 3-19). One-quarter ofthe participants were sexually active by age 12; half were sexually active by age 13; andthree-fourths were sexually active by age 14. The mean number of lifetime sexual partners was24.2 (sd=31.8, range = 1-300); and the mean number of casual or \"one-time\" sex partners was8.6 (sd=14.8, range = 4-150). On average, participants acquired 4.9 (sd=10.1) new partners eachyear that they were sexually active.In the thirty days prior to the baseline, participants had sex with an average of 2.7(sd=3.4, range = 0-45) new partners. Vaginal intercourse was much more prevalent than oral or20 17anal intercourse. The modal frequency for vaginal intercourse in the past month was 2-3 times aweek. In contrast, 80% reported that they did not have oral sex and 91% reported that they didnot engage in insertive anal intercourse during that period. Ninety-seven percent reported thatthey did not engage in receptive anal intercourse; 2.5% had receptive anal sex once or a fewtimes; and 0.5% had receptive anal sex once a week or 4-6 times a week.The principal risk factor for HIV infection among participants was unprotectedintercourse with a female partner. In the year prior to the baseline, 11.2% reported that they hadsex with someone they knew or thought was a prostitute, and 5.3% reported that they had sexwith someone in exchange for drugs. (Five percent reported cocaine use in the past year.) In themonth prior to the baseline, one male indicated that he had sex with another male and four malesindicated that they had sex with males and females. No participant reported injection drug use(since 1978) or sexual contact with an injection drug user.Finally, 95.9% of the participants reported that they had (ever) used condoms. However,only 29.2% had used condoms at first intercourse, and only 32.4% had used condoms at lastintercourse. Thirty-six percent reported that they used condoms the first time they had sex with anew partner. When asked to recall the first time they used condoms, 51.4% reported that first useoccurred more than 24 months before the baseline, 15.5% reported that first use occurred 12 to24 months before the baseline, and 30.6% reported that first use occurred within 12 months ofthe baseline. Seventy-two percent of participants reported that they used condoms for birthcontrol and disease prevention; 20.8% used condoms for disease prevention; and 4.3% usedcondoms for birth control. 18At baseline, the participants assigned to the videotape, health educator, and controlconditions did not differ significantly on any of the demographic, sexual history, sexualbehavior, or condom use measures.IMMEDIATE IMPACTCondom Knowledge. As can be seen in Table 2, participants answered correctly 4 of the sixitems at baseline and at posttest. The overall mean gain in condom use knowledge was Table 2 about here statistically significant, t(547)= 8.34, p<.001. An analysis of covariance indicated that the meangain score varied with condition, F(2,544)= 37.85, p<.001. The mean gain was .87 (sd=1.2)among HE participants, .29 (sd=1.1) among VT participants, and .07 (sd=1.0) among CTparticipants. Bonferroni-adjusted t-tests indicated that the HE condition had a greater impact onknowledge than did the VT condition (p<.001) or control condition (p=.003); and that the VTcondition had a greater impact on knowledge than did the CT condition (p<.001).Condom Use Self-Efficacy. At baseline, participants were \"somewhat\" to \"very sure\" that theycould enact the targeted behaviors (m=1.5, sd=0.5, see Table 2). The overall mean change(m=.13, sd=.45) was significantly different from zero, t(543)= 6.68, p<.001. Further, anANCOVA indicated that the mean change varied with condition, F(2,541)= 3.39, p=.034. It was.18 (sd=.46) among HE participants, .14 (sd=.49) among VT participants, and .07 (sd=.40)among CT participants. Bonferroni-adjusted t-tests indicated that the gain in self-efficacyexperienced by HE participants was significantly greater than that experienced by CTparticipants (p=.024). No other mean differences were statistically significant.02 19Condom Use Intentions. To assess the intervention's immediate impact on condom useintentions, we compared the pretest report of condom use (in the past 30 days) with the posttestreport of intended condom use (in the next 30 days). A separate analysis was performed for\"steady\" partner data and for \"casual\" partner data. Ninety-two percent (n=516) provided partnerdata; 40.5% of these participants indicated that they had a steady partner, 36.2% indicated thatthey had both a steady partner, and casual partners, and 23.2% indicated that they only had casualpartners.At baseline, participants reported that they had used condoms with their steady partnermore than a \"few times,\" but \"less than half of the time\" (see Table 2). At the posttest,participants in all conditions reported that they intended to use condoms more frequently withtheir steady partner than they had in the past 30 days; in fact, 58.1% reported that they intendedto use condoms \"all the time.\" A one-way ANOVA (with the difference between \"past\" andintended condom use as the dependent variable) indicated that the intervention had an immediateimpact on condom use intentions with steady partners, F(2,381)= 3.97, p=.02.Bonferroni-adjusted t-tests indicated that, relative to their baseline reports, HE participantsintended to use condoms more than CT participants. No other pairwise differences werestatistically significant.The participants who had sex with one or more casual partners reported that they hadused condoms between \"less than half' and \"half of the time\" (see Table 2). At the posttest,participants in all conditions reported that they intended to use condoms more; in fact, 77.3%indicated that they intended to use condoms \"all the time.\" A one-way ANOVA indicated thatthe intervention did not have a differential impact on condom use intentions with casual partners,F(2,250)= 0.18, p=.84. However, the overall mean change was significantly different from zero, 20t(252)=13.14, p<.001, suggesting that the clinic experience served to heighten participants'resolve to use condoms more frequently.Perceived Risk. At baseline, 39.1% of participants thought that it was \"very likely\" or\"somewhat likely\" that they would get an the next year; at the posttest, 30.6% heldthis belief. An ANCOVA indicated that the mean change was the same for each condition,F(2,545) = 1.41, p=.24; Student's t-test indicated that the overall mean change (m----0.19,sd=0.44) was significantly different from zero, t(545)=-4.77, p<.001. Following the interventionand medical treatment, 28.8% of the participants perceived that they were at less risk ofinfection, 12.8% perceived that they were at greater risk, and 55.5% perceived the same level ofrisk. The overall decrement in perceived risk was contrary to our expectations.This decrement could reflect the knowledge participants gained about the nature of andtreatment for STDs. That is, some participants may have perceived less risk at the posttestbecause the facts presented during the intervention (or during treatment) convinced them thattheir initial risk perception was based on erroneous information. Although we could not assessthis hypothesis directly, we did look at the relationship between the change in condom useknowledge and the change in perceived risk. The participants who perceived that they were atless risk at the posttest did manifest a gain in condom use knowledge (mean change=.54, sd=1.2).However, a one-way ANOVA indicated that this gain was not significantly larger than thatobserved for the participants who perceived that they were at greater risk or at the same level ofrisk.Alternatively, the decrement in perceived risk could reflect a change in condom useself-efficacy and/or condom use intentions. That is, the participants who perceived that theywere at less risk at the posttest may have had stronger condom use self-efficacy or stronger 04 21condom use intentions than, for example, the participants who perceived that they were at thesame or more risk. To assess the first hypothesis, we examined the relationship between changesin self-efficacy and changes in perceived risk. To assess the second hypothesis, we examined therelationship between the intention to use condoms (during vaginal intercourse in the next 30days) and perceived risk. One-way ANOVAs indicated that the observed changes inself-efficacy and in intention did not vary systematically with changes in risk perception.SHORT- AND LONG-TERM IMPACTCondom Attitudes. To assess the change in condom use attitudes, we used a random effectsmodel and analyzed the available condom attitude scores (N=1,297) from the posttest, 30-day,and 6-month assessments. The model included main effects for condition and time, and thecondition x time interaction. Condom attitude cell means are shown in Table 2.The random effects model accounted for 13% of the overall (i.e., within and between)variability in condom use attitude scores. The condition main effect was statistically significant,X2(2)= 6.90, p=.03. Bonferroni-adjusted z-tests indicated that HE participants had more positivecondom use attitudes than did CT participants (p=.033). The remaining two pairwise meandifferences were not statistically significant. The time main effect was statistically significant,X2(2)=191.8, p<.001. Bonferroni-adjusted z-tests indicated that condom use attitudes at posttestwere more positive than those at the 30-day follow-up (p<.05); posttest condom use attitudeswere also more positive than at the 6-month follow-up (p<.05). The two follow-up meanswere not significantly different. Finally, the condition x time interaction was statisticallysignificant, X2(4)= 12.8, p=.012. Bonferroni-adjusted z-tests indicated that posttest condom useattitudes reported by HE participants were more positive than those of CT participants. No otherposttest (or 6-month follow-up) mean difference was statistically significant.J 22Condom Use Self-Efficacy. To assess the change in self-efficacy over the entire study period,observations (N=1851) from the four assessments were analyzed with a random effects model.Cell means are provided in Table 2. The random effects model accounted for 17% of the overallvariability in self-efficacy scores. The condition main effect was not statistically significant,X2(2)= 0.35, p=.84. However, the time main effect was significant, X2(3)= 426.6, p<.001.Bonferroni-adjusted z-tests indicated that the baseline mean was significantly less than theposttest mean (p<.05), and that both the baseline and posttest means were significantly greaterthan the 30-day and 6-month means (all p's <.05). Finally, the condition x time interaction wasnot significant, X2(6)= 8.7, p=.19.The random effects model indicated that the mean gain in self-efficacy reported by HEparticipants was not statistically larger than that reported by CT participants, z=1.44, p=.15.This finding was not consistent with the finding based on the ANCOVA. Although both modelsestimated the same mean difference (0.11), the standard error used as the denominator in theANCOVA's t-test (.0426) was much smaller than the denominator used in the random effects'z-test (.0753). The fact that the two standard errors differed was not unexpected as the randomeffects analysis included data from the two follow-up assessments. To resolve the discrepancy,we performed two additional analyses using data from the participants (N=175) who wererandomly selected for the 6-month follow-up. For the first analysis, we used a random effectsmodel (N=739). For the second analysis, we performed a repeated measures analysis ofvariance. Both analyses suggested that the self-efficacy gain reported by HE participants was notsignificantly different from that reported by CT participants.Sexual Relationships. At the posttest and follow-up assessments, the percentage indicating thatthey had a steady partner were 37%, 41%, and 44% respectively; the percentage indicating thator 23they had a steady and one or more casual partners were 33%, 28%, and 21%; and the percentageindicating one or more casual partners were 21%, 29%, and 32%. For the correspondingassessments, data were missing for 8%, 2%, and 3.2% of participants.Number of Partners. To determine if participants had sex with fewer partners following theintervention, we used a random effects model to analyze the baseline, 30-day, and 6-monthresponses (N=1,273) to the item asking about the number of sexual partners in the past thirtydays. The cell means are shown in Table 3. Table 3 about here In contrast to other analyses, the random effects model accounted for very little of theoverall variability (1.2%). The condition main effect was not statistically significant, X2(2)=0.37, p=.83. However, the time main effect was significant, X(2)= 8.93, p=.012.Bonferropi-adjusted z-tests indicated that the baseline mean was smaller than the 30-day mean.No other pairwise mean difference was statistically significant. Finally, the condition x timeinteraction was not significant, X(4)= 7.22, p=.12.Number of Acts. To determine if youth had sex less frequently after participating in theintervention, we used a random effects model to analyze the baseline, 30-day, and 6-monthresponses to the item asking, \"How often did you have vaginal sex with your steady (otherpartner(s)) in the past 30 days?\" Separate analyses were performed for the steady partner data(N=1,073) and the casual partner data (N=984).The cell means associated with condition and assessment (time) were remarkablyconsistent for the steady partner data (see Table 3). Consequently, the random effects model 24accounted for a modest proportion of the overall variability in the responses (10.0%). Thecondition main effect was not statistically significant, X2(2)= 1.63, Bonferroni-adjusted z-tests indicated that thebaseline mean was smaller than the 30-day mean and the 6-month mean (all p's <.05). The twofollow-up means were not significantly different. The condition x time interaction was notsignificant, X(4)= 1.40, p=.84.The means for the casual partner data were also remarkably consistent (see Table 3). Therandom effects model accounted for 7.5% of the overall variability. The condition main effectwas not statistically significant, X2(2)= 0.34, p=.84; the time main effect was significant, X(2)=81.9, p=<.001. Bonferroni-adjusted z-tests indicated that the baseline mean was smaller than the30-day mean and the 6-month mean (all p's <.05). The two follow-up means were notsignificantly different. Finally, the condition x time interaction was not significant, X(4)= 2.54, Condom Use Intentions. To assess the intervention's impact on condom use intentions, welooked at participants' baseline reports of condom use in the past 30 days, and their posttest andfollow-up reports of how often they intended to use condoms in the next 30 days. Specifically,all available observations were analyzed with a random effects regression model that included amain effect for condition, a main effect for time (pretest, posttest, 30-day, 6-month), and acondition x time interaction. Separate analyses were conducted on the steady partner data(N=1,409) and the casual partner data (N=1,136).The model for the steady partner data accounted for 29% of the overall variability incondom use intentions. The condition main effect was not statistically significant, X2(2)= 0.77,p=.68. The time main effect was significant, X2(3)= 635.6, p<.001. (The reader is reminded that 28 25the first measure was reported use and that the three remaining measures were intended condomuse.) Bonferroni-adjusted z-tests indicated that the baseline mean was significantly less than theposttest and follow-up means (all p's<.05). None of the remaining pairwise mean differenceswere statistically significant. Finally, the condition x time interaction was,not significant,X2(6)= 6.98, p=.32. In short, at baseline, participants reported that they had used condoms withtheir steady partner \"less than half of the time\"; following participation, they reported that theyintended to use condoms \"more than half of the time\" with their steady partner.The model for the casual partner data accounted for 18% of the overall variability incondom use intentions. The condition main effect was not statistically significant, X2(2)= 4.16,p=.12. The time main effect was significant, X2(3)= 256.3, p<.001. Bonferroni- adjusted z-testsindicated that the baseline mean was less than the posttest, 30-day, and 6-month means (allp's<.05), and that the posttest mean was greater than the 30-day mean (p<.05). No otherpairwise mean difference was statistically significant. Further, the condition x time interactionwas not statistically significant, X2(6)= 1.8, p=.94. As with the steady partner data, reports ofparticipants' intended condom use with casual partners exceeded the use reported at baseline.Although many participants did not intend to use condoms consistently (as recommendedby the HE and VT interventions), a significant proportion did report that they were going to usecondoms whenever they had sex. At posttest, 57.8% indicated that they intended to use condomsconsistently with their steady partner; at the follow-up assessments, this percentage increased to67.9% and then dropped to 63.6%. Among participants with one or more casual partners, therespective percentages were 70.0%, 52.0%, and 59.0%.Condom Use Behaviors. Change in condom use behavior over the study period was assessedwith a random effects model that included a main effect for condition, a main effect for time 2 9 26(pretest, 30-day, 6-month), and a condition x time interaction. Separate analyses were conductedon the steady partner data (N=1,022) and the casual partner data (N-861).The model for the steady partner data accounted for 25% of the overall variability inreported condom use. The means are shown in Table 3. The condition main effect was notstatistically significant, X2(2)= 0.63, p=.73. The time main effect was statistically significant,X2(2) 352.8, p<.001. Bonferroni-adjusted z-tests indicated that the baseline mean wassignificantly less than both of the follow-up means (all p's<.05). The 30-day and 6-monthfollow-up means were not significantly different. Neither was the condition x time interaction,X2(4)= 1.02, p=.91. At baseline, participants in all conditions reported that they had usedcondoms with their steady partner \"less than half of the time\" during the preceding month;following participation, they reported that they used condoms \"more than half of the time\" withtheir steady partner.The model for the casual partner data accounted for 18% of the overall variability incondom use intentions. The means are given in Table 3. The condition main effect was notstatistically significant, X2(2)= 4.55, p=.103. The time main effect was significant, X2(2)= 60.8,p<.001. Bonferroni-adjusted z-tests.indicated that the baseline mean was significantly less thanthe 30-day and 6-month means (all p's<.05). The two follow-up means were not statisticallysignificant. Neither was the condition x time interaction, X2(4)--- 1.2, p=.88. Like participantswith steady partners, the participants with casual partners reported greater condom use at thefollow-up assessments than they did at the baseline assessment.As with the condom use intention data, the pattern of means masked the fact that a largeproportion of the participants reported that they had used condoms whenever they had sex. Atposttest, 18.3% indicated that they had used condoms every time they had sex with their steady 27partner; at the follow-up assessments, this percentage increased to 53.2% and then dropped to50.8%. Among participants with one or more casual partners, 26.0% reported that they usedcondoms consistently; at the follow-up assessments, this percentage increased to 39.9% and thento 49.5%.Perceived Risk. The pretest-posttest analysis suggested that study participants perceivedthemselves at the posttest to be at less risk for another STD infection within the coming year. Toassess the change in perceived risk over the entire study period, all available observations(N=1849) were analyzed with a random effects regression model that included a main effect forcondition, a main effect for time (pretest, posttest, 30-day, 6-month), and a condition x timeinteraction. The model performed poorly, accounting for 6.3% of the overall variabilityin perceived risk. The means are shown in Table 2.The condition main effect was not statistically significant, X2(2)= 4.10, z-tests indicated that thebaseline mean was significantly greater than the posttest mean (p<.05), and that both the baselineand posttest means were significantly greater than the 30-day and 6-month means (all p's <.05).At 6 months, participants tended to perceive more risk than they did at the 30 day assessment(p=.09). The condition x time interaction was not significant, X2(6)= 4.48 p=.61. At baseline,participants thought that it was \"not very likely\" that they would contract an infection; by the30-day assessment, they perceived themselves to be at even less risk; and by the 6-monthassessments, there was a tendency for participants to perceive themselves to be at an increasinglevel of risk. 31 28DISCUSSIONWe used a randomized, longitudinal study design to assess the relative effectiveness of a14-minute, educational intervention designed to increase condom use among African Americanadolescent males seeking care at an STD clinic. The intervention was based on well-researchedmodels of behavior change; and it was developed for black, adolescent males and with the closecooperation of clinic staff, a local, African American video production team, and local, at-risk,African American adolescents.We hypothesized that the intervention delivered by the health educator would be moreeffective than the videotape version. First, the health educator could answer the participant'squestions and, thus, tailor the intervention messages to the individual's circumstances. Tailoringmessages enhances the likelihood that the participant will attend to, comprehend, retain, and acton the messages. Second, and more importantly, each participant was asked to use a penis modeland practice the steps associated with putting on and removing a condom correctly; and eachparticipant received feedback from the health educator as he practiced with the penis model.(The videotape condition allowed for cognitive rehearsal.)The intervention had an immediate positive impact on condom use knowledge, condomuse self-efficacy, and condom use intentions with one's steady partner. Specifically, participantsin the health educator condition exhibited greater condom use knowledge than did participants inthe videotape condition; in turn, the latter exhibited greater condom use knowledge than didparticipants in the control (standard care) condition. The impacts on condom use knowledgewere noteworthy in that participants correctly answered four of the six items on average atbaseline. Participants in the health educator condition also showed greater gains in condom useself-efficacy than did control participants. This effect may be due to the fact that the former were3 '' 29able to practice condom placement and discuss condom use with an African American female(albeit within the constraints of a 14-minute intervention). Participants in the videotape andcontrol conditions were not afforded either opportunity. Finally, the intervention had animmediate positive impact on the condom use intentions (within the next 30 days). Healtheducator participants intended to use condoms more often with their steady partners than didcontrol participants. The intervention did not have a differential impact on condom useintentions with one's casual partners.In a review of AIDS risk-reduction interventions targeting adolescents, Kim, et al. (1997)report that successful programs are more likely to be theory based, incorporate cultural issues,address developmental issues, and teach coping skills. Our intervention had these characteristics,and it effected three important outcomes.The intervention was designed to make participants aware that their sexual behaviorplaced them at risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases. However, contrary to what weexpected, perceived risk scores declined from pretest to immediate posttest for participants in allconditions. (Subsequent risk perceptions indicated an additional decrement from the posttestlevel.) Kowalewski, Henson and Longshore (1997) suggest that inconsistent results of studies ofrisk reflect problems in measurement and design; however, our measure and design meet thedesiderata they identify. This immediate decrement was not explained by an increase in condomuse knowledge, although the possibility remains that the perception of less risk was due to theconcrete, accurate information that the intervention provided about STDs, knowledge that wasnot assessed by the six-item condom knowledge scale. The decrement was also not explained bya change in condom use self-efficacy or condom use intentions. 30It is possible that the immediate decrement in perceived risk was due to a reduction in theparticipant's feelings of vulnerability -- the very feelings that we thought would work in favor ofthe intervention's goal. Specifically, at baseline, participants may have been experiencing aheightened sense of arousal because they knew or thought that they had an infection. Even ifthey knew what infection they had contracted, they could not be sure that medical treatmentwould be straightforward or that they had not suffered any lasting effects. Thus, they would beexperiencing uncertainty when they completed the baseline. In contrast, when they completedthe posttest, they would have learned if they had an infection and the nature of their infection,and they would have received treatment. They would be \"better\" and feeling less vulnerable andless uncertain than they were feeling at baseline. Feeling better, they may have perceivedthemselves at less risk for a subsequent infection.The subsequent decrement in risk perception may reflect participants' misunderstandingof the risks associated with low-risk behaviors (Wiley, 1989). At the follow-up assessments,participants reported that they had engaged in sexual behavior that put them at risk of STDinfection \"a few times.\" As Wiley (1989) noted, most individuals correctly perceive that the riskof infection based on their behavior is small. Moreover, because they tolerate small risks, mostindividuals will see no advantage to modifying established patterns of behavior, particularlywhen those patterns frequently result in favorable outcomes. However, tolerance of small risksand the maintenance of old habits by individuals can result in an epidemic like HIV/AIDS.We had hypothesized that the intervention's immediate impacts on condom use attitudes,self-efficacy, and intentions would be sustained if participants' condom use efforts weresuccessful (reinforced). The data indicated that the immediate impacts on condom use attitudesand condom use self-efficacy were not sustained. Although participants in the health educator 3 4 31condition held more positive condom use attitudes than did control participants at baseline,condom use attitudes declined in the month preceding the 30-day assessment. Moreover, amongparticipants in all three conditions, condom use self-efficacy at the follow-up assessments wassignificantly less than that at either the baseline or immediate posttest. It is possible thatparticipants' subsequent experiences during sexual contacts, including experience with condoms,were inconsistent with (i.e., did not reinforce) the beliefs that they reported at the immediateposttest. Instead of maintaining the beliefs and pleading special circumstances to explain theinconsistent behavior (as one focus group participant remarked, \"Man, you should have seenher\"), participants may have modified their beliefs.Although the intervention promoted correct and consistent condom use, participants wereinformed that they could reduce their risk of infection by having sex with fewer partners and byhaving sex less often. The findings indicated that participants in all conditions intended to havesex with more partners and then reported having sex with one more partner on average in themonth preceding each follow-up assessment. Similar increases were observed in their intentionsand in the reported number of acts of vaginal intercourse with steady and casual partners.(Participants averaged one more act of intercourse in the month preceding each follow-upassessment.) It is possible that the sexual activity of many participants was adversely affected bytheir STD symptoms in the days prior to their clinic visit; and, following treatment, their activityreturned to more typical levels.The one intervention impact that was sustained over the 6-month study period involvedcondom use intentions. Specifically, condom use intentions with steady and with casual partnersincreased following participation in the intervention and remained strong. At the posttest and 30-day follow-up, more than half of the participants reported that they intended to use condoms 32whenever they had sex with their steady partner; at the 6-month follow-up, slightly less than halfindicated such intentions. The data suggested that intentions to use condoms consistently werestronger for casual partners than for steady partners. However, among individuals who had botha steady partner and casual partners (which was roughly one-third of the participants completingeach assessment), proportionately more participants reported consistent condom use intentionswith their steady partners as the study progressed, and fewer participants reported consistentcondom use intentions with their casual partners. The stronger intention for consistent condomuse with one's steady partner than with one's casual partner may reflect the perception that therisk of an unintended pregnancy is greater with a steady partner than with a casual partner.Finally, participants in all conditions reported more frequent condom use (in the pastthirty days) at the follow-up assessments. The review by Kim et al. (1997) indicates that animpact on condom use is associated with interventions which are culturally targeted as ours was.However, the reported behavior, \"more than half of the time,\" was not the recommendedbehavior, which was to use condoms for each and every act of intercourse. Because participantsin all conditions reported more frequent use, the increase appears to have been due to theexperience of having an STD and receiving disease-specific information and treatment.Alternatively, reports of increased condom use could reflect demand characteristics. Thepurpose of the intervention would have been clear to any participant assigned to eitherintervention condition: a poster on the health educator's wall displayed the videotape's title andtheme song, \"Put it On!\" Moreover, participants in all conditions received condoms when theycompleted each questionnaire. Thus, any participant who was motivated to exaggerate his actualcondom use could certainly do so. However, if participants were motivated to portraythemselves in a favorable manner, one might expect to see the same demand characteristics at36 33work when participants reported condom use attitudes and condom use self-efficacy, both ofwhich declined during the study period; and one might expect to see the same demandcharacteristics at work when participants reported the number of partners they intended to havesex with in the next month and the number of partners they did had sex with, both of whichincreased during the study period.The present findings can be interpreted in light of a prior review of the effectiveness ofvideo interventions delivered in STD clinics (Healton & Messeri, 1993). In six of the eightstudies, most of the participants were African American men. Healton and Messari found thateducational interventions delivered by videotape had substantial short-term effects on knowledgeabout and attitudes toward condoms. Our findings, based on black adolescent males, indicatedmodest, immediate effects on condom use knowledge and self-efficacy. Stronger impacts wereobserved among participants in our face-to-face health educator condition. To the extent that ourfindings can be generalized, they suggest that an intervention presented face-to-face toAfrican-American males by an African-American health educator may have greater immediateimpact on psychosocial determinants of sexual and condom use behavior than a culturallYappropriate videotape that presents the same messages in the same period of time.Our findings also suggest that our educational intervention did not provide participants withthe knowledge, skills, or motivation needed to enact the recommended risk reduction behaviorson a continuing basis. Indeed, the intervention's immediate impacts on condom use self-efficacywere not even sustained for one month. However, an educational intervention presented in abusy clinic setting will have to be of limited duration. Thus, prevention researchers andprogrammers need to combine their efforts with the efforts of other service providers and offer 34community-based programming in settings that are readily accessible, receptive, and proximal tothe locations and settings where adolescents gather and meet potential partners. 35REFERENCES Airhihenbuwa, C.O., Di Clemente, R.J., Wingood, (1992).
