At the [San Ignacio Resort Hotel](https://www.sanignaciobelize.com/), you can take part in an authentic Maya copal spiritual healing experience and a tea-tasting and medicinal trail tour. What is Copal? Copal is a tree resin made from the sap of tropical trees. The word comes from the Nahuatl (Aztec) word copalli. Traditionally, it comes from the copal tree, which is one of a family of trees known as incense trees. These include frankincense, myrrh, and torchwood trees. These trees produce a distinctive, highly aromatic sap. Copal producers gather the sap and mix it with spices, seeds, and roots to create copal blocks. What is a Copal Cleansing Ritual? The use of copal in cleansing ceremonies goes back to the ancient Maya and Aztec civilizations. These ancient people believed that resin was sacred and offered it to the gods. In Belize, indigenous Maya have long used copal in cleansing and purification rituals. They use copal to remove negative energy from a space, to go with prayers, in sweat lodge rituals, or to commemorate weddings and funerals. The well-known Mexican celebration Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) began as a copal ritual. During that time, people burnt copal on their altars as offerings to the souls of their loved ones. Benefits of a Copal Cleansing A copal cleansing will refresh you spiritually. A copal cleansing can soothe anxiety. After a ceremony, you'll sleep better, and you'll feel better able to handle life's problems. It enhances meditation and helps you focus. If you have been feeling out of sorts with the world, use a copal cleansing to restore your mental and emotional balance. Discover why this healing ritual has lasted for centuries as a restorative, healing ritual.
