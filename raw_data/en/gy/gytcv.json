Learning to read is allowed to evolve for each child in the same form as it evolved from the beginning of humanity: spoken language developed first, then people drew pictures to communicate their ideas, followed by symbols such as hieroglyphics and finally the abstract letters of our modern alphabets. Once there was a written language, people learned to read. This is exactly the sequence in which children master language, and it also is the sequence in which reading is taught in Waldorf schools. 1. Importance of the Spoken Word At Waldorf schools, from birth to age seven, the focus is on the spoken word. In kindergarten, the curriculum emphasis is on spoken verses and stories: nature stories, folktales and fairy tales. Teachers are 'storytellers' and are careful not to \"dumb down\" or simplify the language of fairy tales. The teacher is careful to use clear speech and to enunciate well as this immersion in literature is the basis of literacy. This immersion in the spoken word will also help children later when it comes time to learn to write and spell. 2. Repetition Helps Retention The same sequence and stories are repeated in daily circle time for weeks at a time. Children learn these stories, songs and verses \"by heart,\". Rudolf Steiner, founder of Waldorf education, stressed the importance of repetition when he developed the first Waldorf school in Germany in the 1920's. Current brain research confirms that repetition aids a child's brain development. The connections of billions of neural pathways in the brain are strengthened through repeated experiences. 3. Writing Begins Holistically In the first grade of Waldorf the alphabet is formally introduced in an imaginative, pictorial way. There are no photo-copied worksheets here! Each letter of the alphabet is presented as a picture representing an element from a story the children are told. For example, they might hear the story of a knight on a quest who had to cross mountains and a valley. The children will then draw a picture with the letter \"M\" forming the Mountains on either side of the \"V\" for Valley. In this way, the child develops a living relationship with each letter rather than going straight to the abstraction of the alphabet letters themselves. These 'pictures' can be described as the rainbow bridge between the pictorial thinking of the child and the abstract thinking of the adult. After learning all the letters, the next step is to copy the teacher's writing into their beautiful 'main lesson books', the books that children in a Waldorf school create themselves. These first written sentences and stories come from the children's own experience and the children's first practice of 'reading' is the reading of their own text. This progression can be illustrated by the following typical activity: the teacher will write a poem on the board that the children already 'know' by heart. Through joyful recognition of familiar sounds and words they begin to 'read' the poem and then write it in their books. 1.
