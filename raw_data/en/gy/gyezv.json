If your answer was a YES, how did you measure it? Is it because you're still in shape? Or because you don't have any diseases? What about toxins? Are you free of them too? Most people measure their health from the above factors. But they leave out the toxins because it is not well known. But since birth, if you haven't detoxicated at least once, how much of these do you think is stored inside your body? To clarify things, first, let me explain what toxins are. These are naturally occurring poisons. All living organisms which undergo metabolism will create toxins on their own. They could be proteins, molecules, etc., that get inside you both from inside and outside of your body. Typically, our body has mechanisms to cleanse the body naturally. The liver is the most significant organ in your body, which cleanses toxins from within. These systems ensure that our bodies safely detoxify any toxins and pollutants we ingest. The liver and kidneys are particularly important, but other organ systems with similar functions include the lungs, skin, and digestive tract. Toxins could be naturally born in our body, but due to the lifestyle we are living in the modern society, the systems are changing. People are more obliged to eat fast food with different chemicals, fats, etc. therefore, now the body doesn't only has to deal with natural toxins, but it also has to cleanse all the other poisons we take with our daily food intake. And that is how most of these toxins accumulate and get stored inside your body, making you experience all different types of changes, various illnesses, etc. However, some systems may take longer to cleanse the human body when making confident lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol. And when these harmful chemicals are allowed to remain in the body, they can wreak havoc. These metabolic wastes can create pathways for diseases like blood poisoning, organ failure, and vision loss, to name a few. It has now become a world crisis in the present day. People, every single person who is walking on earth, has accumulated toxins in their bodies. And since the internal organs can't fight all the natural and artificial toxins alone, we now should help the body to detoxify quickly. After such detoxification, you are supposed to feel lighter and much more active than before. Let us quickly list down some common symptoms of a toxic body. Low energy Brain fog Constipation Inability to stay concentrated Fatigue Sudden gain or loss in weight Mentality issues, such as depression, anxiety, irritation, mood swings Acne, sudden allergy outbreaks, itchy skin Eyebags and dark circles Sleeping problems Unexplainable sore throat Poor immunity So now is the chance to check yourself if you have experienced one or more of the above symptoms. If you do, then we highly suggest you take the necessary steps to detoxify your body now. So that is why we tested and researched about many different detoxing items including body patches, medications, injections, and many more. And something that we understood very early in our research was that other than everything else; the body patches did the job better. But not all of the brands were as effective and productive as the NUUBU detox foot patches.

We wrap the Nuuba Detox patches around our feet to use the 60 points to help with some health conditions. They can help with various issues, including irritability, headaches, fatigue, and brain fog. They cleanse through the sweat glands in the feet triggered by the acupuncture needles. Each foot has about 125 sweat glands, which produce half a liter of sweat daily.
