Pharm aceutical companies that d o this properly are immune from liability for failure to warn in the event o f drug -related acciden ts. Arguments to abandon or chang e the learned interm ediary doctrine ha ve increased recently due to perceived fundamental changes in the healthcare environment. The basic argument for altering or abandoning the rule i s that it was adop ted in respo nse to a paternalisti c style of healthca re that no longer exists. Some arg ue th at the requirem ent o f inform ed consen t made the d octrine irrelev ant; the re is no longer reason to limit warn ings to the p rescribing physician if the patient is active in the d ecision making. This lin e of reasonin g rejects the1 premise that it is most effective to provide prescription drug warnings to physicians rather th an to the ultim ate us ers (pa tients o r con sumers). Others argue that th e insufficiency (or irrelevance) of the doctrine is more modern , stemming from the s ignificant pressure s plac ed on the professiona l judgment an d autonom y of physicians by direct- to-consumer ad vertising and manag ed care.

The debate rages about how best to serve the goals of tort law in relation to those indiv iduals injured by presc ription drugs. Propone nts o f the traditional applicatio n of the learned interm ediary doctrine a rgue that efficienc y and patien t safety remain best served by adhering to the doctrine. Those advocating a change in the doctrine argue that the learned intermediary doctrine protects pharmaceutical manufacturers at the cost of leaving many plaintiffs unco mpensa ted fo r drug -related injuries. A stalem ate be tween two positions results: either the learned intermediary doctrine is ineffective because its underlying justifications no longer apply or the underlying justifications have continu ed re levance despite massiv e changes in the deliv ery of healthca re. What both sides agree on, however, is that there has been a revolutionary change in healthcare delivery. Thi s Note argues, however, that this assumption is3 exag gerated; health care d elivery is not the most relev ant fac et in assessing the continu ed vitality of the lea rned interm ediary doctrine. This No te arg ues that the learne d inte rmediary doctrine w as ad opted, prim arily, because there was a su bstantial disparity betw een the knowledge of the physician and that o f the patient. In the context of this k nowledge disp arity, the learned interm ediary doctrine is necessa ry to serve the t ort law g oal o f accid ent cost avoidance, which requires the consumer warning to be given to the party in the b est po sition to provide th at w arning . Patient em powerment an d the4 environment of healthcare delivery have changed the doctor-patient relationship in the last forty years. However, the disparity between physician and patient knowledge endures, and arguably grows, making the learned intermediary doctrine as timely as ever. Part I of this Note discusses the rationale of the learned intermediary doctrine , its history , and its exc eptio ns. P art II describes arguments th at the learned interm ediary doctrine sh ould be abrogated com III describes and es arg uments th at the learned interm ediary doctrine sh ould be retained, but should be applied in a way that takes into account fact-specific information about the quality of the doctor-patient relationship and healthcare2006 ] THE L EARNED INTER MEDI ARY DOCTRI NE 399 5.734 A .2d 1245 ( N.J. 1999). 6.For a clear discussion of these goals, see Ausness, Learned Intermediaries , supra note 4, at 1226- 39.

THE LEAR NED INTE RMEDIARY DOCT RINE AND ITS EXCE PTIONS This section discusses the rationale, the application, and the case law history of the learne d inte rmediary doctrine. In addition, it describes a few of the excep tions that have been carved out in particu lar jurisdictions re lating to mass immunizations, birth control, and (in one case) d irect- to-consu mer ad vertising (Perez v. Wyeth L abor atories, Inc. ). 5 A. Purpose of the Learned Interm ediary Doctrine The learned intermediary doctrine exists to serve the tort goal of accident cost a voidanc e, whic h is acco mplished by requ iring the consu mer warning to be given by the party in the best p osition to pro vide th at warning . This re flects the6 realities of the prescription drug market. Individuals who use prescription drugs necessarily interact with a prescribing physician. The physician mus t receive7 the w arnings abo ut the presc ription drugs because he o r she will u se tha t information, in the context of the individual patient's medical history, to recom mend a course o f treatm ent (o r alternativ e courses of treatm ent). These8 warn ings will be communicated to the patient throug h the p rocess of obtaining inform ed consen t or by involving the patient in his or her m edical decision - making. This m ethod of communicating warn ings to the patient is con sidered9 to be th e most effective means of passing along this information and should result in the best health outcom es for indiv idual patients. 10400 INDIANA LAW RE VIEW [Vol. 40 :397 11.

Id. at 85. 19. Id. B. Application of the L earne d Interme diary Doctrine The m ajority of jurisdiction s apply the learned interm ediary doctrine a s a duty-oriented rule. Manufacturers know wh at actions are required to receive11 immunity from failure to warn c laims. This a pproa ch serves the policy goal o f12 reducing administrative costs because \"an original producer will know in advance that it satisfy [sic] its duty to warn by conveying product safety information to the appropriate intermediary. In contrast, a balancing tes t will impos e significant information costs on many of the parties in the distributive chain. \" A duty-oriented test decrease b ecause ts can13 prevail at th e summary judg ment sta ge of litigation if they can show they provided adequ ate w arning s to the p rescribing physician. A general practice14 of deciding failure to warn claims on summary judgment motions should \"discou rage plain tiffs from litigating frivolous claim s and . . . give the parties an incentiv e to settle m eritorious ones. \" 15 C.

W yeth L abor atories held21 that the m anufac turer o f the Sabin polio vaccine was not p rotected by the learned interm ediary doctrine b ecause it ac tively participated in de signing the immunization clinic, and therefore knew that the prescription drug would be dispen sed outside the contex t of the d octor- patient relationshi p. \"It was22 dispen sed to all at mass clin ics w ithout an in dividualiz ed balancing by a physician of the risks inv olved. In such cases . . . warning by the manufac turer to its immediate purchaser will not suffice[,]\" and the manufacturer must directly warn the consumer or ensure that he or she receives an adequate warning. 23 Reyes v. Wyeth L abor atories extended the log ic of Davis to cases in which24 the m anufac turer \"had am ple rea son to fore see\" produ ct w ould be \"dispen sed witho ut for dis tribution of prescription drugs.\" Althoug h Wy eth d id no t activ ely part icipate in the immunization25 program (in contrast to Davis), it shou ld ha ve been fa miliar w ith \"p ractices a nd knowledge common in the drug indu stry as to dis tribution and administration of pharmaceutical products.\" Courts split on whether the exception should apply26 when a physician administers the vaccine in his or her office (not in a clinic situation). 27 Some jurisdictions recog nize an add itional exception to the lea rned interm ediary do ctrine fo r con traceptiv e pre scriptions (bo th for oral contraceptives and for intrauterine devices (IUDs)). The justification for this28 excep tion is different, and more c ontrov ersial, than that for mass im munizations. A physician is pres ent in these case s, but it is alleg ed th at there is a change in the dynamic of the phy sician- patient relationship sufficient to abrog ate the learned interm ediary doctrine. The co urt in MacDo nald v.

In the case of IUDs, even more physician involvement is requ ired, as the IUD must b e ord ered and then fitted.36 Another p ossible excep lea rned interm ediary doctrine e xists w hen the F ood and Drug Administration (FDA) requires inserts in pack aging of prescription drug products that are intended for consumers.

For instance , in a 2003 decision, New Jerse y Citizen A ction v. Scher ing-Plo ugh Corp., the court dism issed a claim fraudule nt ad ription allerg (affirm ing63 the lo wer court's judgm ent) stated that, regardless of the Perez holding , \"the interv ention by a physician in the decision- making process necessitated by his or her exercise of judgment w hether or not to prescribe a particular medication protects consumers in ways resp ecting efficacy that are lack ing in advertising campaigns fo r othe r prod ucts.\" 64 Perez is a substantial e xpan sion in reas oning for exceptions to the lea rned interm ediary doctrine. It doe s not assu me the absen ce of a physician (like the immunization cases) nor does it look at th e relat ive inv olvement o f the patient and physician in the decision to use a particular prescription drug or device (like the cases involving birt h control). Rather, it concludes that the current overall environm ent in which healthcare is practiced, with m anag ed care an d direct- to- consu advertising , petent to act as learned interm ediaries. If true, this could warrant a radical reconfig uration of failure- to-warn jurisprudence for prescriptio n drugs. There are three basic propo sals for chang ing the traditional applicatio n of the learned intermediary doctrine. The first option is to follow the courts which have carved out ex ception s for certain kinds of cases.

ABOLI SHING THE LEAR NED INTE RMEDIARY DOCT RINE One proposal is to abolish the learned interm ediary doctrine c ompletely so that p rescription drugs are treated like any othe r pro trad itional67 produ manufac turers a re res pons ible fo r warning the end users of their p roducts of forese eable dang ers. A n ex ception was crea ted fo r68 prescriptio n drugs because of the difficulties associa ted w ith effectiv ely reach ing the intended, no nmedical audi ence wit h adequate warni ngs. The re are two69 basic arguments fo r abolish ing the learned interm ediary doctrine and requ iring prescription drug manufacturers to warn consumers directly. First, patients are educa ted an d em powered and no longer ne ed a learned interm ediary . ptions upon whic h the doctrine arguably rests, including the inability to reach consu mers, the n eed for the physician to be the sole source of patient information, and the desire courts have not to intrude on the d octor- patient relationsh ip. 70 A. Patients A re Educa ted a nd Empowered The first ration ale for abro gating the learned interm ediary doctrine is that consumers are capable of understanding information directly from manufacturers and do not n eed the in tervention of a physician to un derstand warnings. One version of this argument is that the concept o f inform ed consen t itself ren ders th e learned interm ediary doctrine irrelev ant. Susan A. Casey asserts that \"[t]he single m ost im portant argument in favor of direct- to-patient warnings is the notion of inform ed consen t.\" Inform ed right of self-determination,\" which requires a disclosure of risks and benefits that a reasona ble p erson would need to kno w to m ake a choice based upon his or her ow n values. Casey argues that \"in the case of dr ugs and72 devices, both the p hysician a nd the m anufac turer are qualified to disclo se material info rmation regarding risks and adverse effects.\" If this is true, then73 a patient can arrive at inform ed consen t to take a prescriptio n drug merely by reading the warnings provided by the manufacturer.

This is the more rigorou s standar d. A nothe r legal standard is based on\"need lessly subjected to the physician's or the courts' discre tion.\"75 Another version of this argument rests on the assumption that patients are adequately ed ucated to understand direct warnings because they receive inform ation from drug com panies via advertising and becau se the y learn abou t medicine via the internet and other sources . The court in Perez relied on an early form ulation of this argumen t that asserted that ad vertising had changed th e relative roles of the physician and patient in medication decisions. By directly76 providing consumers with information about their products, manufacturers \"enab l[ed] co nsum ers to be mor e activ ely involved in making decisions abou t prescriptio n drugs.\" The physician's role is diminished , althoug h it is still v ital77 becau se a prescriptio n rem ains necessary to purch ase these drug s. Therefore, the \"legal princi ples applicable to other product sellers should apply equally to prescriptio n drug manufac turers who adv ertise their prod ucts.\" This a rgument78 implies that the direct-to-consumer advertising for pharmaceutical products is capab le of providing effectiv e education and inform ation to consu mers, and that the pharmaceutical manufacturer d isplaces the physician as the best person to warn . These arg uments a re fla wed because they mischaracteriz e the role o f the educa ted p atient i n a healthcare e ncou nter. The \"ro ot pre mise\" fo r the legal conce pt of inform ed consen t in healthca re has existed in the U nited States since 1914 , when the co urt in Schloe ndor ff v. Society of New York Ho spital declared79 that \"e very human being of adult years an d sound mind h as a right to determ ine what shall be done with his o wn body.\" The doctrine was entrench ed as80 \"alm ost axiom atic\" by the time Canterbury v. Spence was de cided in 19 72. The81 court in Canterbury states, True cons ent to what h appen s to one's self is the informed exercise of a choice, and that entails an opportunity to ev aluate knowledgeably the option s available a nd the risk s atten dant upon each. The av erage patient has little or no understanding of the medical arts, and ordinarily has only his physicia n to whom he can look for enlightenment with which to reach an in tellig ent d ecision.82 The physician is therefore obligated to disclose to the patient the material risks and be nefits that would enable a reasonable person to make an educated decision .

Both the physician and the patient (by reading literature prov ided by the manufacturer) may be able to unde rstand the risks equa lly well. This is the argument that the court advances in MacDonald v. Ortho Phar maceutical Corp., 475 N .E.2d 65, 69- 70 (M ass. 1985). 86. JAMES F. CHILDRE SS, WHO SHOUL D DECIDE?

The docto r bring s to the h ealthcare encou nter h is or her expertise, acquired throug h a decad e or more o f classro om education and clinical training , which requires the ap plication of \"tex tbook \" knowledge to each indiv idual patient. Very rarely is the re eq uality of medical knowledge between the doctor and the patient. 85 The conte xt of healthca re decision m aking, then, is on e in whic h the doctor describe s the option s and lik ely results of therapeu tic op tions (or of doing nothin g), and then the p atient chooses based on his or her ow n values. For instance , a patien t with pro state ca ncer can choo se betw een medical manag ement surg ical tech niques . To m ake an inform ed decision, the patient needs to know rates of success and which complications potentially accompany which treat ments.

Direct-to-C onsu mer Adve fo r Lear ned Interm ediary Doctrine Seriou s pro blem s e ument th at direc t-to-consumer advertising destroys the presumptions upon which the learned intermediary doctrine is based. 1. Pharm aceutica l Manufa cturers Ca n Reach Consumers.\u2014Commentators argue th at the learned interm ediary doctrine w as ad opted because pharmaceutical manufac turers w ere inc apable of reac hing consumers and that direc t-to-consu mer advertising has changed th at asse ssment. Some scholars have suggested that d rug companies can effectively reach patients because their advertising campaigns are so su ccessful. For ex ample, the co urt in Perez argued that, \"hav ing spent $1 .3 billion on advertising in 1998 , drug manufac turer s can hardly be said to 'lack effectiv e means to co mmunicate directly with patients, ' when their ad vertising campaigns can pay off in clo se to billion s in dividends .\" The court in Perez89 relied o n Lars N oah's assessm ent w hen refusing to apply the learned interm ediary doctrine in its g round break ing decision. 90 Although advertising may increase sales, it remains true that it is virtually impossible for pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide a warning to specific patients based on their uniqu e medical history and condition and the co nstellation of other drugs they may be taking. The near impossibility of providing specific91 warn ings rem ains ev en anufac co nsum ers. The ability to \"reach\" consu mers in the se nse of providing them with pre scription drug inform ation sufficient to en tice them to request a pro duct does not g uarantee that the inform ation is tailored to their phy siolog ical ne eds. Direct- to-consu mer advertising therefore does not abrogate the need for the learned intermediary doctrine solely because it prov ides a n effec tive channel for reac ts. 2. Physician Must Be Sole So urce of Info rmation.\u2014At least o ne commentator conten ds th at the learned interm ediary doctrine is on ly valid if the physician is the sole s ource of patient in form ation.

How ever, there is nothin g in the doctrine itself that suggests that a physician can act as a learned interm ediary only when he or she is the sole s ource of patient information. Courts do not require this when they apply the learned intermediary doctrine . In Davis v. Wyeth, for instance, the court held that the decision to93 94 prescribe a particular drug is essentially a medical one, but it do es not state that the patient cannot be in fluenced by any othe r sou rces. In Thomas v. Hoffm an-95 La Roche, Inc ., the court held that \"th e ph ysician throug h ed ucation ,96 experien ce, and specializ ed train ing is in the best p osition to make a benefit/risk analysis in making the determination to prescribe a particular drug for a specific patient. \" Also, in Terhune v. A.H. Robin s Co ., the court held that \"[t]h e97 98 patient is expected to and, it can be presum ed, does place prim ary relianc e upon [the physician's] judgment.\" The physician's expertise is still needed, even if99 there are other sources of patient inform ation. The unde rlying fact that physicians tailor manufac turer w arning s to indiv idual patients does not c hang e, regardless of how many othe r sou rces o f inform ation a patient m ay have. 3. Direct-to-Consumer Advertising (\"DTCA\") Purposefully Interferes with the Doctor-Patient Relationship.\u2014A third argument is that th e learne d intermediary doctrine should be eliminated because it exists in part to preserve the doctor-patient relationship, but pharmaceutical companies intentionally intrude on this relatio nship throug h the ir ag gressiv e advertising cam paigns. Fairnes s sho uld th erefore prevent th ose companies from relying on the learned intermediary doctrine as a shield against failure to warn liability. Th is100 argument h as co mmon sense appea l and \"is a powerfu l argument if one believ es that the primary purpose of the learned intermediary rule is to benefit pharmaceutical companies at the expense of consumers.\" However, it fails to101 relate to the p urpose of the lea rned interme diary doctrine, w hich is to protect consu mers at the lo west cost. \"[I]f the primary beneficiaries o f the learned interm ediary rule are co nsum ers, and not d rug com panies , then the condu ct of2006 ] THE L EARNED INTER MEDI ARY DOCTRI NE 411 102.

APPLYING THE LEAR NED INTE RMEDIARY DOCT RINE AS A FACT -BASED INQUI RY er than argu ing that it is more effectiv e in terms of the tort law goal o f accident cost avoidance to warn consumers directly (as the first set of proposals did), the p roposa ls in this section as sume that warn ings to physicians can be th e most efficie nt way to protect consu mers, but only in cases where the physician is not overly constrained by pressures of the modern healthcare environment. Therefore, a fact- based inqu iry into the co ntext of the pro vision of the prescriptio n m edication is re quired to de termine whethe r the learned interm ediary shou ld be available to ph armaceutical manufac turers a s a defense to liability . The log ic, in part, is th at ph armaceutical companies are n ot exem pt from failure to w arn liab ility when they have re ason to be lieve the physician will n ot be in a position to redu ce risk . The m ain im plication for litig ation of this k ind of fact- based inquiry is that it wou ld be more difficult for defendants to win at the summary judgment stage of litig ation , and the rela tionship of the p atient an d physician wou ld be factual matters be st evaluated by a jury. In addition, a factor- balancin g approach opens up the number of potential defendants available to suit; it \"extends liability to pa rties farther down the distributiv e chain without necessa rily reliev ing parties who are farther up th e chain.\" Therefore, this approach might compensate103 victims better, but the costs of accident avoidance and administration would increase.104 Proposals that depend upon skepticism about the doctor-patient relationship vary in their details, althoug h com mon them es include a loss of the p aternalistic, dyadic d octor- patient relationsh ip an d negative effects of direct- to-consu mer advertising and managed care.

The doctrine he suggests is: 106 A manufacturer has the duty to warn the ultimate user of an unavoidably unsafe pro duct, notwithstan ding the fact tha t the produ ct is sold to an interm ediary or that the product is l egally unobtainab le without recourse to an manufac turer m ay disch arge its duty to warn by warn ing only the interm ediary when it kno ws or has reason to know that the in termediary i s in a po sition to minimize the risk posed by the product.107 The factors Hall propo ses t hat the courts weig h when making the determination of the doctor's ability to minimize risk encompass all of the excep tions adop ted b y jurisdictions th roughout the co untry and othe rs that arguably inf luence the pr escription pr ocess no w and in the f uture.

Those four factors are: (1) w hether and to what ex tent the pharmaceutical company has engaged in dire ct-to-consu mer ad vertisem ent and the b readth and nature of tha t advertising; (2) whether the pharmaceutical company has repeatedly encou raged physicians to pre scribe their p roduc ts throug h gifting and other aggressive marketing practices; (3) whether and how the pharmaceutical company h as made its products ava ilable through Internet pharm acies ; and (4) whether th e traditio nal p hysician- patient relationsh ip ex ists.118 After evaluating these factors , the \"co urts sh ould then balance the equities. \"119 Like Hall, Calabro notes a change in the d octor- patient relationsh ip. She states, \"When the learned interm ediary doctrine developed , the physician and patient had a p rofessional relationship guided by ethical and fiduciary respon sibilities. The physician, driven by the Hipp ocratic Oath, d id not encou nter the counterv ailing press ures th at exis t toda y, nor was the consumer inund ated w ith info rmation communicated directly from the pharm aceutical manufac turer.\" 120 1. Questioning th e Assum ptions .\u2014Ta ken together, these two proposals suggest three feature s of modern medicine that co uld a dversely affect the physician's ability to serv e as a learned interm ediary . The first is that p hysicians are m ore distant from their patients and arguably less motivated b y altruism than they were in the 1960s (and before). The second is that managed care makes physicians less trustworthy than they were u nder fee-for-service pa yment arrang ements in centiv struc tures. The third is th at direct- to-consu mer adv ertising creates conflicts betw een the p hysician and the patient that diminish the quality of the physician's care.

What ab out the claim that p hysicians are n o lon ger altruistic and canno t be trusted to put their patients' concerns over their own? First, it is highly simplistic to say that physicians were once bound by the Hippocratic Oath, but currently are not. The Hipp ocratic Oath has many adm irable su ggestions, such as to \"com e for the b enefit of the sick\" and to guard confide nces. It also, however, has131 problematic counsel (as we would expect from a G reek, cultic group from 4 B.C.E.), such as the prohibition against surgery and abortion. The Hippocratic132 Oath is only one possible oath that could be said to influence phy sician ideals.133 American physician (and signer of the Declaration of Independence) Benjamin Rush counseled hero icism for physicians in 18 01. \"Ru sh's id eal ph ysician134 . . . would never refuse to treat patients because of poverty, or exploit their vulnerability. Indeed, the virtuous physician was heroic: should a pl ague strike a community , the physician was oblig ed to stay and treat the ill, ev en at the risk of death.\" However, being human beings, one can safely assume that all135 doctors were not heroes, and m uch of the professional ethics literatu re written by physicians during this \"golden age\" of the doctor- patient relationsh ip foc used on physician interests. For exam ple, in the mid-1920 s, Rich ard C abot was analy zing the ethi cal aspects of fee-splitting, and in the 1930s the American Medical Asso ciation was busy lobb ying against \"national health insuran ce, group practice, and physician advertising .\" 136 From a historical perspec tive, it is in accurat e to arg ue th at the learned interm ediary doctrine w as ad opted becau se physicians were perfectly virtuous in the 1960s. There has been a de crease in the intim acy betw een physicians and patients, but phy sicians were and are not perfectly virtuo us.

Proponents of direct-to-consumer advertising suggest three beneficial results for patients. First, patients can learn to describe their symptoms more effectively by hearing the advertisements, thus improving their communications with their physicians. Second, individuals who previously were not under a doctor's care140 visited a physician for the first tim e for previously untreated chron ic con ditions such as obesity , hypertensio n, high cholesterol and depressi on. Third, drug141 advertising can serv e as a pa tient rem inder, whic h ca n im prove pa tient compliance.

Direct- to-consu 144 advertising can therefo vide su bstantial health benefits for pa tients. Many commentators in both the law and medicine were not so optimistic about direct-to-consumer advertising's benefits for patients and the community. Many of the arguments by legal commentators who advocate a change in the learned interm ediary doctrine in the presenc e of direct- to-consu mer ad vertising are sh ared by thos e who would like to abolish the doctrine com pletely . For instance , these com mentators com plain that increases in advertising \"leav [es] the pharmaceutical company without the excuse that it could not communicate directly with co nsum ers.\" This N ote arg ues that d irect- to-consu mer145 advertising does not \"reach\" consumers with adequate warnings, even if it could be shown that it translates into prescription drug sales.

How ever, the d ata reg arding how direct- to-consu mer advertising works so far is problem atic as a justification for alterin g the learned intermediary doctrine for three reaso ns. First, it will be difficult to hold manufac turers liab le for adv ertising that leads to inappropriate presc ribing if the physician prescribes a different brand-name of the drug, which frequently happ ens. S econd , the fact that inates pharm aceutical manufac turing suggests that the pressure s on phy sicians are no t substantially different than they wer e before direct-to-consumer advertising. Finally, it is possible to man age these pressures without altering the doctrine. In fact, there are tools in quality managed care that can strengthen the ability of physicians to fun ction as true learne d inte rmediaries. c. Mana ged care.\u2014Manag ed care ha s also been iden tified as a major impe diment to quality interac tions betw een physicians and patients. Man aged care principles have been used in some insurance companies since the early 1900 s, but th ey became more p opular during World War I I, obviously pred ating Sterling v. Cornish. It really began to take off, however, in the ea rly 1990s, as167 costs of medical care beg an to rise d ramatically .

Does managed care, generally, help physicians serve as a learned intermediary? Or, as critics claim, does it undercut their effectiv eness so substantially that the doctrine shou ld no t apply unless the manag ed care arran gement is carefully scrutin ized in each case ? Another way of putting this is: should pharmaceutical manufacturers decline to420 INDIANA LAW RE VIEW [Vol. 40 :397 172. Hall, supra note 2, at 227. 173. Id. 174. Id. at 226. 175. GEORGE C.

Id. at 694. trust the physician's judgment when he or she participates in a managed care insuran ce plan? There are two characteristics of managed care that are particularly objectionable to com mentators. First, com mentators perceiv e tim e pre ssures on physicians under managed care that were absent in fee-for-service payment arrang ements. Althoug h not sp elled o ut by the commentators, the argument172 would be that manag ed c are ca used a red uction in ph ysician incom e, so physicians felt com pelled to see more patients p er da y. Therefore, physicians reduced the time spent with each patient, leaving less time to discuss side effects and other possib le adv erse rea ctions to pre scription drugs. One could argue (conv incing ly) that time pressure s exist u nder any system of payment. Physicians get paid acco rding to the n umber of patients they see and the n umber o f billable procedure s they do. It is malpractice unde r any system of payment for physicians to sacrifice competent care to increase their incomes. It does not fo llow that p harm aceutical manufac turers sh ould now be respons ible fo r investigating the individual contexts of medical care to see if physicians are committing malpractice. The secon d trou bling characteristic o f manag ed care is the \"c ontrol over the doctor patient relationship by third party payors.\" Phys icians clearly dislike173 having the involvemen t of third parties in their medical decision making. Physician autonom y was n early abs olute in did, w ithout being seco nd guessed by bureaucrats. 174 Physician autonomy do es not impr ove patient safety. Ph ysicians like practicing without external controls, and patients believ e that physician freedom correlates with quality care. In fact, there is good reason to thin k that physician practice im proves under manag ed care arran gements. Physician autono my, combined with solo practitioners or th ose who practice in small groups, leads to astoun ding variances in ph ysician practice. One study found that 135175 physicians would suggest eighty-two different treatments for the same patient.176 Even H all, a critic o f manag ed c are, notes the q uality con cerns unde r an unreg ulated of unnece ssary, and even harmful, medical interventions.\" There is no data to support the notion that undertreatment is178 more tro ubling than overtreatm inj uries o ccur from too2006 ] THE L EARNED INTER MEDI ARY DOCTRI NE 421 179.

Consumer safety is best serv ed by well-trained physicians with inform ation available a bout new studies of drug safety and with oversight of practice patterns, so that a patient can be confident that his or he r physician is not among the unsafe outliers in medical practice. IV. DEFENSE OF THE TRAD ITIONAL APPLICATI ON OF THE The learned interm ediary doctrine in its curren t form is th e most efficie nt way to serve the goals of tort law and the goals of healthcare in general. Physician expertise relating to the effects of prescription pharmaceutical products on indiv idual patients justifies th e doctrine. Physicians are the best pa rties for pharmaceutical manufacturers to warn because they can understand the warnings and communicate information about risks tailored to each individual patient. This warn ing system is e fficient and serv es the tort law goal o f minimizing accident avoidance costs. Despite the ability of pharmaceutical manufacturers to reach consumers with package inserts and direct-to-consumer advertising , it remains just as difficult (if n ot impossible) for pharmaceutical manufacturers to tailor w arning s to indiv idual patients as it was when the term \"learn ed interm ediary \" was co ined in 19 66. 180 Altho ugh the learne d inte rmediary doctrine remains th e best and most efficient way to warn patients of potential side effects of prescription drugs, more can be done to streng then the expertise of physicians and further protect patients. Managed care, far from b eing the source of problems, can be used to improve care and guard against illicit influences on physician prescribing behaviors, both in term s of direct- to-consu mer ad vertising and in abro gating or altering the lea rned inter mediary doctrine. The first is that physicians are n o lon ger neede d to act as interm ediaries be cause patients are em powered and educa ted. It is therefore a vestige of paternalism to al low pharmaceutical manufacturers to warn physicians instead of the users of prescription drugs. Thi s argument fails becau se ed ucated consumer s still need learne d inte rmediaries that ca n tailor medical inform ation to eac h ind ividual's uniqu e medical history The secon d arg ument is that the environm ent o f healthcare delivery has changed so su bstantially that physicians can no longer be trusted to act in their422 INDIANA LAW RE VIEW [Vol. 40 :397 181.

This N ote arg ues that ca lls for chang ing the learned interm ediary doctrine a re partly based on m istak en assum ptions abou t the current healthca re vironm ent. In particular, propo nents of cha nging the learn ed interm ediary doctrine ten d to romanticiz e the doctor- patient relationsh ip when the d octrine was adop ted (circa 1966) and exag gerate p ressures on physicians today . Physicians have alway s faced pressure s of time constrain ts and financial conflicts of interest. Yet, the legal community (and society as a w hole) has still expected them to exercise professional judgment. In addition, the effects of direct- to-consu mer ad vertising have not been as prono unced as both critics an d advocates had expected. It has had a modest impact o n pharm aceutical sales, whic h ten ds to incr ease sales of therap eutic c lasses of drugs rathe r than at th e level of specific brand -name pre scriptions .181 Despite direct-to-consumer advertising, it remains true that the physician is in the best pos ition to warn e ffectiv ely the consu mer about p otential adverse effects of prescription drugs. It is untrue that managed care makes it impossible for physicians to act as learned intermediaries. Moreover, managed care in its best, modern form , can be a tremendo us asset in prov iding quality healthcare, prac tices, and minimizing drug accid ents in the first place. It sho uld be seen as an ally , not an enemy, in physician judgment an d patient health. Opening up pharmaceutical manufacturers to additional liability for failure to warn doe s not ch ange the fact tha t they cannot e ffectiv ely warn in dividual patients and is unnecessa ry in light of the speculativ e data about both harm s and benefits of direct-to-consum er ad vertising and manag ed care. If future stud ies demonstrate that direct- to-consu mer advertising has becom e more e ffectiv e and has subverted the physician's ability to ex ercise professional judgment, then this issue will need to be re visited. However, the important first step that healthcare deliv ery system s need to take is to streng then the ex pertise o f physicians so th at they have all of the tools to function as experts on their p atients' b ehalv es.
