FIONA REDDANfinds out which treatments are covered and by how much WITH THE cost of private health insurance on the way up again, it makes sense to get the most out of your policy. But, while you may be well clued up on your entitlements when it comes to GP or consultant visits, have you ever stopped to consider what alternative therapies you may be covered for under your private health insurance? Although levels of cover may not be at the standard of France - where you can get thalassotherapy treatments covered by the state - health insurers have made significant strides over the past few years in terms of their coverage of so-called alternative therapies. While not all alternative treatments are covered - reiki and oxygen therapy are just some of those not yet deemed eligible for a rebate - many are. But what are they and by how much are they covered? Dietitian IF you're keen to start the new year off by losing weight sensibly, a visit to a dietitian might be on your agenda. Such a visit may also be worthwhile if you need advice on coeliac and gluten-free diets, dealing with high cholesterol, or conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. In general, you can expect to pay \u20ac50 - \u20ac70 for a consultation, but most insurers offer some degree of a rebate on this. At the VHI, cover is provided for members of its core and options plans (Plans A-E, A-C Options) and also its LifeStage plans (First Plan, Family Plan, Forward Plan - except First Plan Starter and First Plan Select). The benefit is defined as a complementary medicines benefit and the visits are combined with other complementary or alternative medicine visits to receive a combined benefit. As such, members of its core and options plans can get \u20ac13-\u20ac20 per visit back, to a maximum of 12 visits and subject to excess of \u20ac200-\u20ac300 depending on the plan held. LifeStage Choices members on the other hand can get \u20ac25-\u20ac35 per visit back, for up to seven visits subject to an excess of \u20ac25 per person per year. Quinn Healthcare offers 50 per cent back on up to five visits a year, although depending on your insurance plan, reimbursements may be also subject to an outpatient excess. At Aviva, you can get money back for a visit to a dietitian if you are a member of its Day-to-day 50 plan, or Everyday plans. Acupuncture GIVEN the number of Chinese medical clinics which have sprung up, acupuncture is a therapy on the rise. Used to treat a variety of ailments including infections, dermatology and psychological conditions, acupuncture is often seen as an alternative to drugs. The cost of a session is typically about \u20ac50, with a reduction offered on follow-up sessions, but depending on your health insurance plan, you could get some of this money back. Aviva, for example, offers \u20ac25 back per visit on its Day-to-day 50 plan for eight visits a year. At Quinn Healthcare, you are entitled to claim 50 per cent back on the cost of acupuncture up to a maximum of 12 visits per year. At the VHI, acupuncture is included under its complementary medicines benefit package outlined above. The Hospital Saturday Fund (HSF) also offers a reimbursement on the cost of acupuncture sessions. For example, under its 1450 plan, you can get half the cost of treatment back, up to a maximum of \u20ac260 a year. Cranial osteopathy A bit of a mouthful, cranial osteopathy is nevertheless a therapy on the rise. The technique is popular among mothers whose babies may have suffered trauma during birth, and are subsequently developing problems with sleeping or colic. It essentially involves gentle manipulation of the skull to relieve stresses experienced by babies during child birth. At Aviva, you can claim back either \u20ac25 if you are a Day-to-day plan member, or \u20ac30 as part of the Day-to-day practitioner's package on its Level 1 and Level 2 Everyday plans. This package entitles the member to claim back \u20ac30 for up to 25 combined visits a year to either a massage therapist, osteopath, dietitian and reflexologist. At Quinn Healthcare, you are entitled to up to 50 per cent of the cost back, up to 12 visits a year, while the HSF also offers a grant towards the cost. Homeopathy THIS therapy involves using homeopathic remedies to assist the natural tendency of the body to heal itself. At Quinn Healthcare, you can get up to 50 per cent back for up to 12 visits a year, while Aviva Day-to-day 50 members can get \u20ac25 back for up to eight visits, and the HSF also offers cover. For example, under its 2050 plan you can get up to \u20ac390 back on a number of treatments, including homeopathy, a year. The VHI does not offer cover for homeopathic treatments. Massage YOU might not expect it, but you can actually receive money back from your health insurer on the cost of a massage. Under Aviva's Day-to-day 50 and Level 1 and Level 2 Everyday plans, you can get money back on visits to a massage therapist offering a variety of treatments, including Indian head and sports massage. And, if you've just had, or are expecting a new baby, you may be interested to learn that the cost of baby massage is also covered, at least in part, under many policies. The massage technique used is thought to help babies who have colic or reflux problems, as well as help them relax and fight off infections. You can find accredited teachers through Baby Massage Ireland (BMI) and a set of four classes will typically cost \u20ac100-\u20ac200. However, you can considerably defray the cost by claiming back against your insurance policy. For example, if you have Aviva Health Day-to-day 50 plan, you can get \u20ac25 for each of eight visits per year, or \u20ac30 on its Everyday plans. The VHI pays up to \u20ac100 towards baby massage classes for members on its LifeStage Choices range of plans, while at Quinn Healthcare you can also get up to \u20ac100 back. Medical herbalists HERBAL medicine is the treatment of illness using whole plant material in the form of tinctures, teas, capsules, creams, ointments, etc. According to the Irish Institute of Medical Herbalists, it can be used to treat almost any condition, including respiratory disorders such as colds and sinusitis; digestive disorders such as chronic indigestion and Crohn's disease; and skin problems including eczema and psoriasis. At present, Aviva is the only insurer offering money back on visits to a medical herbalist. It offers up to \u20ac25 for each of eight visits on Day-to-day 50. Reflexology DATING back to ancient Egypt and China, reflexology is the practice of treating points in the feet and hands that relate to corresponding parts of the body. It is thought to be effective for a wide range of ailments including reducing stress, migraine, arthritis, sports injuries and digestive disorders. With a large number of practitioners in the State, reflexology is a popular treatment, and is now even offered to babies. As such, insurers offer good cover for the technique. At Quinn Healthcare, for example, you can get up to 50 per cent back on up to eight visits a year. At the VHI, benefit is granted as part of its complementary medicine package, while Aviva offers cover on both its Everyday plans and Day-to-day 50 plan. Tax rebate IT may also be possible to claim some of your expenses for complementary treatments back on your Med 1 form, although, in general, treatments would need to be carried out by someone who is a qualified practitioner in accordance with the Medical Practitioners Act 1978.
