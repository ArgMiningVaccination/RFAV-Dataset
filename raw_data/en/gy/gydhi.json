While the occasional ten minutes of day of [meditation](https://edit.sundayriley.com/at-home-meditation-space/) or a walk around the neighborhood can help with a temporary mood boost (one-third of Instagram trend survey takers said they will continue to partake in mental wellness exercises like guided meditation and manifestation exercises in 2022), there's no doubt that during our pandemic age sometimes we need something a lot more restorative. Whether you want to break out of your daily routine or you're just looking for some time to decompress in a peaceful setting, these wellness resorts and spas are perfect for your next escape. The Spa at the Inns of Aurora View this post on Instagram [A post shared by The Spa at the Inns of Aurora (@innsofauroraspa)] With the breathtaking backdrop of 350 acres of lush greenery and fields overlooking Cayuga Lake, the 15,000 square foot spa at the [Inns of Aurora](https://innsofaurora.com/spa/spa-services/packages), which opened last June, is a one-of-a-kind destination in the Finger Lakes area. [Inspired by Ayurveda](https://edit.sundayriley.com/energy-levels-down-here-are-some-strategies-from-an-expert-in-traditional-asian-medicine/) (a wellness approach that takes into account your body type, temperament, and lifestyle), guests can participate in a variety of treatments that offer a holistic approach to wellness \u2014 from massages to facials to [energy work like reiki](https://edit.sundayriley.com/advice-from-a-reiki-master-ways-to-shift-your-energy-when-youre-in-a-funk/). Not sure where to start? Consider a two- or three-day [retreat](https://innsofaurora.com/spa/spa-services/Multi-Day-Retreats?mc_cid=815b799a5b&mc_eid=0d7aa82612) that gives you a little bit of everything they have to offer. The Duet Retreat, for instance, is a couples retreat that helps you bond on a deeper level with your partner. It starts off with receiving [a self-reflection journal](https://edit.sundayriley.com/journal-at-the-end-of-the-year/) with prompts to start your journey. Day one consists of reflexology, a \"love yourself\" meditation, contrast bathing circuit (hot/cold water therapy), and [forest bathing](https://edit.sundayriley.com/forest-bathing-hikes/) (a contemplative walk in the woods). Day two kicks off with a silent trail walk to the spa, followed by an aromatherapy duet massage, connection meditation, an \"intentional\" meal, and ends with a traditional indoor or outdoor sauna, plus hydrotherapy time. When you're not getting a treatment, you're encouraged to take leisurely strolls along the property's nature trails or relax in any of the multiple meditation spaces. Cal-a-Vie Health Spa View this post on Instagram Thanks to California's consistently great weather, there's no shortage of wellness retreats in the Golden State. [Cal-a-Vie](https://www.cal-a-vie.com/) sets itself apart from the rest by practically transporting you to the rustic French countryside. Think: sunkissed lavender fields, rolling hills, terra-cotta roofs on top of the 32 villa-style rooms, and imported pieces of French architecture to capture the elegance of a Proven\u00e7al village. Visits are broken into three-, four-, or seven-day stays. On top of tennis, golf, yoga, and a food and wine program with a focus on French fare, there's over 100 spa treatments for the ultimate pampering. The menu is packed with familiar offerings like a body scrub or a brightening facial but there's also some distinct offerings like an aquatic massage in the watsu pool, an algae jam slimming body wrap, and cupping with gua sha. Whatever journey you choose, you're sure to feel like you've introduced your body to greater health and wellness. Sho Sugi Ban House View this post on Instagram If you've ever felt the need for a vacation from your vacation (any parent knows exactly what this means), look no further than [this idyllic retreat](https://shousugibanhouse.com/) nestled in Water Mill after your next Hamptons stay. It's the kind of place where you can feel the stress melt away just by soaking in the minimalist architecture and ocean air. Owner Amy Cherry-Abitbol, who's a former corporate lawyer who spent many years living in Tokyo, brings the healing culture of Japan to overnight retreat programs that could start off with a daily morning movement class before a pre-treatment soak at one of the three outdoor saltwater plunge pools, followed by a bodywork session, facial, or therapeutic bath of your choice. After fueling up on a plant-based meal (Michelin-star chef Mads Refslund leads the kitchen), you can end the day with one of the Healing Arts programs, which range from an immersive [sound therapy](https://edit.sundayriley.com/sound-as-stress-relief/) journey, shamanic healing class, and reiki \u2014 or a variety of yoga, breathwork, and meditation. Every part of your wellness journey here is customized to your goals and needs, so everyone will find something that feeds their body and spirit. Rancho Valencia Resort & Spa View this post on Instagram According to [Fodor's Travel](https://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/california/north-county-and-around/hotels/reviews/rancho-valencia-resort-spa-576940), [Rancho Valencia](https://ranchovalencia.com/) is one of the few properties in all of the U.S. with a five-star rating for both the resort as well as the spa. Twenty pink \"casitas\" contain 49 Spanish-style bungalows that each feature an outdoor space as well as a fireplace. Tucked away among the olive groves is the newly renovated spa with an expanded fitness center, a new salon for hair and nail services, as well as expanded locker rooms and relaxation areas. The spa has its own adults-only pool, a watsu treatment pool, sauna/steam room, plus a non-intimidating number of wellness options to choose from \u2014 whether you're in the mood for a massage or facial. Our favorite: the Balancing Gemstone Massage that incorporates oils with cooling crystals to address imbalances that can cause stress or [insomnia](https://edit.sundayriley.com/dealing-with-pandemic-insomnia-here-are-the-pro-sleep-products-i-swear-by/). While it's certainly a romantic getaway, this resort is also a family-friendly option (with on-site babysitting when parents need a few hours away). Though it's just a few minutes from the charming neighborhood of La Jolla, you'll be hard-pressed finding a reason to leave the premises. The Lodge at Woodloch View this post on Instagram An escape surrounded by 500 acres of woodlands, this [destination spa resort](https://www.thelodgeatwoodloch.com/) is all about helping you shift from your everyday, mundane routines and finally focus on yourself. No matter if you want a day packed to the brim with activities (each day they have at least 35 seasonal classes and workshops like archery, nature walks, birdwatching and more) or if you want to bliss out at the spa, you can tailor your experience to you. Take part in a chakra balancing massage that's designed to address imbalances in your energy, a craniosacral to assist cerebrospinal fluid to flow in your body, and healing light therapy \u2014 among many other offerings. If you live locally (and therefore you simply refer to as \"The Lodge\"), you don't need to stay overnight at the lodge to take advantage of the spa: All of the options can be done on an a la carte basis as part of a day pass. An hour before as well as the hour after your treatment, you can decompress in the eucalyptus steam room, sauna, indoor pool, or any of the indoor/outdoor whirlpools. Ten Thousand Waves View this post on Instagram [A post shared by ten thousand waves (@tenthousandwavesjapaneseresort)] Just 10 minutes from downtown Santa Fe, you'll find [this secluded, 12-guest room lodge](https://tenthousandwaves.com/) inspired by the soothing onsens of Japan. Open to the great outdoors (the hot springs are particularly soothing under a starry sky), get a soak in the hot saltwater tubs before you embark on a spa treatment. The signature Japanese shiatsu massage uses a full-body, oil-free sequence (kata) to address muscle tension or other physical stress. You also can't miss out on the Japanese organic massage facial, which includes everything you'd expect (exfoliation, cleansing, masking), but also a unique kneading approach that increases blood flow, stimulates lymphatic drainage, and tones skin. For the exceptionally stressed-out individuals, consider the Transformation Retreat package, which uses the benefits of FDA-approved ketamine to encourage a \"reset of the nervous system\" that alleviates anxiety and chronic pain. The two-night stay includes private outdoor bath time, bodywork, one ketamine journey, breakfasts in bed, dinners at the on-site Izanami restaurant, and sessions with your dedicated Transformation Tour Guide. Miraval Berkshires View this post on Instagram [This New England sanctuary](https://www.miravalresorts.com/miraval-berkshires/)'s peaceful scenery makes it hard to not immediately post everything on the 'gram, but the whole point of Miraval is to disconnect from distractions and create a more balanced life. Especially if you're new to self-care (or you're overwhelmed by all the options), Miraval helps you break down what your wellness journey could look like by starting with your [intention](https://www.miravalberkshires.com/journeys-with-intention/). That could be anything from self-connection to dealing with [grief and loss](https://edit.sundayriley.com/11-instagram-accounts-to-help-you-process-grief/) to culinary and nutrition to mental well-being. If you're there for the ultimate spa experience, for example, some suggested activities include the Sweet Slumber aromatherapy (a face, neck, and shoulder massage that's perfect for lulling you to sleep for a restful night), a Tulsi Rose Facial that uses locally harvest flowers and herbs to stimulate lymph and circulation, plus a Reflex session that focuses on pressures points in your feet and hands to give you greater balance. Stay for multiple nights at the resort or just come from the day \u2014 you'll get full access to all the resort amenities as well as free yoga, the pool, meditation, and wellness lectures.
