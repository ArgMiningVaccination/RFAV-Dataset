There is great intrinsic value in a community health needs assessment when it serves to validate, justify and defend not -for-profit status and create opportunity to identify and address community health issues. During 2015 members of the community were a sked to complete a survey to help identify unmet health needs. Analysis of the primary research data and secondary research was used to identify health concerns and needs in the community. Community partners assisted with the development of an asset map that lists resources and assets that are available to address each need. A gap analysis and prioritiz ation exercise was also conducted to identify the most significant health needs and to further address these needs through the implementation strategies that are included in this document. Sanford Sheldon has formalized strategy to address the following c ommunity health needs: Mental Health Children and Youth In this report you will find the implementation strategies for 2017 -2019, information about what Sanford is doing to address the needs, assets and resources that are available in the community to address the needs, and a discussion o f the impact from the 2013 implementation strategies. At Sanford Sheldon , patient care extends beyond our bricks and mortar. As a not -for-profit organization, ensuring that the benefits of health care reach the broad n eeds of communities is at the core of who we are. Through our work with communities, we can bring health and healing to the people who live and work across our communities. Together, we can fulfill this mission. Sincerely, Rick Nordahl Chief Executive O fficer Sanford Medical Center Sheldon 2 Implementation Strategies Priority 1 : Mental Health/Behavioral Health Mental health includes emotional, psychological, and social well -being. It affects how people think, feel and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including: Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse Family history of mental health problems Mental health problems are common but people with mental health problems can get better and many recover completely. Sanford has prioritized mental/behavioral health as a top priority and has set strategy to reduce mortality and morbidity from chemical addiction and mental health diseases by recruiting a triage therapist, and working to reduce drug and alcohol abuse in the community by working with the high school counselor to enhance curriculum to include abuse issues. Priority 2 : Children and Youth An at -risk youth is a child who is less likely to transition successfully into adulthood. Success can include academic success and job readiness, as well as the ability to be financially independent. Sanford has developed strategies to support the you th in the area by enhancing the community environment. Sanford will work with community development and provide assistance for reopening of a local resource for youth and p rovide after school programming in a structured environment for our youth . Sanford will s upport the expansion of day care with capital and will also work with the local day care center to provide quarterly education sessions for students and parents. 3 Community Health Needs Assessment Implementation Strategy for Sanford Sheldo n Medical Center FY 2017 -2019 Action Plan Priority 1: Mental Health/Behavioral Health Projected Impact : Better access to more providers Goal 1 : Hire a triage therapist Actions/Tactics Measureable Outcomes Dedicated Resources Leadership Community partne rships and collaborations Recruit a triage therapist to improve access to mental health/behavioral health 1 FTE triage therapist is hired 2017 budget addition -
