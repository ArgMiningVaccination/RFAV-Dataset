He will be undergoing surgery to have the affected kidney removed and then he will be undergoing IL-2 immunotherapy. I would like to get him some healing crystals to help him stay strong and positive, and help his body to fight the cancer.

Also, are there any healing crystals that you could recommend for caregivers of cancer patients?
