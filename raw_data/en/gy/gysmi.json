Christina is a Reiki Master, certified sound healer and spiritual life coach. Come sit in ceremony and enjoy a cup of ceremonial cacao, a powerful heart-opening plant medicine. During this Cacao Ceremony, you'll set intentions for ceremony and deepen your relationship with the sacred medicine of cacao. During your guided meditation, you'll also experience sound and energy healing allowing you to connect to the energy of the earth and your higher self. Be prepared to release what no longer serves you and set intentions for what you wish to bring into your life during this event. We will do brief introductions before the ceremony, then place our intentions into the cacao and drink it. Following the cacao ceremony we will have a deep meditation with sound bath. Reiki healing will also be provided during your meditation. After the meditation everyone may participate in our healing sharing circle if they wish to do so. Ceremonial Cacao is 100% pure organic cacao from the highest quality. It is a heart opener and has lots of nutrients. It is not hallucinogenic. Please bring something to sit on. A cushion, blanket, or whatever will make you comfortable. We will have some extra pillows and blankets on hand if needed. You may want to lie down during the meditation. Bring a journal, pen, and water bottle. If you would like to bring an item for the altar, please do so. (It will be returned.) Limited to 15 participants. $35 donation per person required.
