HOW TO VERIFY PROOF OF NEGATIVE COVID-19 TEST AND COVID-19 VACCINE: The Los Angeles County Health Officer Order (9/28/21) mandates that: VACCINE CARD AND DIGITAL COPY THROUGH HEALTHVANA - Effective October 7, 2021: - a record of full COVID-19 vaccination status or a negative COVID-19 test performed within the previous 72 yours is required before entry to outdoor mega events, and - proof of at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is required to enter or work in indoor portions of bars, lounges, nightclubs, breweries, wineries, and distilleries in Los Angeles County. - - Effective November 4, 2021: - bars and similar establishments throughout Los Angeles County will be required to verify full vaccination of all patrons and employees prior to entry to indoor portions of their establishments. Everyone should be given a CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card (white card) when they are vaccinated. It is the official proof of vaccination. Please keep it safe as it cannot be replaced. Consider taking a photo or making a photocopy of it. If you did not get a white card, or you lost it, there are 2 ways to get a copy of your official record from the state's California Immunization Registry (CAIR). FREE TRANSPORTATION TO VACCINE APPOINTMENTS - Ask your primary care provider to look up your vaccination record in the California state immunization registry (CAIR) and give you a copy. - Request a copy of your vaccination record directly from the state immunization registry, CAIR. Please wait at least 2-3 weeks after you are vaccinated before making the request and know that this request may take an additional 2-3 weeks given the high demand. Complete the online [Authorization To Release Form](https://cairforms.cairweb.org/AuthorizationToRelease/AuthorizationToRelease). Have a scan or photo of a current official picture ID ready to upload as the form must be completed in a single session. You will receive a record by email. The record can only be requested online and can only be provided by email. For more information, visit [cairweb.org](https://cairweb.org/forms/). Can I get a digital vaccination record? - The CDC white card or CAIR record is your official proof of your COVID vaccination. You may receive a digital record in addition to your white card as a convenience, but it may not be accepted at all places/companies as the official proof of vaccination. - Several different kinds of digital reminders and records are being used in LA County. The type depends on the record keeping system used by the provider who administered the vaccine. Most systems require the person being vaccinated to give an email address and/or cell phone number when they make an appointment or get vaccinated. Ask your provider when you get your vaccine about a digital record. - The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (DPH) has partnered with [Healthvana](https://healthvana.com/)to provide a digital copy of the vaccination record to people who are vaccinated at Department of Public Health locations, select community clinics (that are not part of a hospital system), pharmacies, or FEMA sites in Los Angeles County. For more information on Healthvana and electronic records, see the DPH \" [After you get a vaccine](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/vaccine/vaccinationrecords/)\" webpage. - - MISSION CITY TRANSIT: A shared curb-to-curb community service, is offering free transportation to COVID-19 vaccination appointments (walk-up or scheduled appointments) within the regular service areas.

VACCINE THIRD DOSE AND BOOSTER SHOTS VACCINE THIRD DOSE AND BOOSTER SHOTS The difference between third doses and booster doses is more than just a language issue. Third doses are meant to elicit an antibody response where there was an inadequate antibody response before, while booster doses are meant to increase antibody levels that have waned after a robust increase in the months after vaccination. With emerging data indicating that certain populations will need more support to be protected, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on August 13, 2021, recommended a third dose of mRNA vaccines for immunocompromised people, including transplant recipients, people with advanced or untreated HIV infection, people actively receiving cancer treatment, and people taking immunosuppressive medications. Third doses have been available to eligible individuals at vaccination sites across Los Angeles County since Saturday, August 14, 2021. Additionally, following the CDC's announcement that booster doses of mRNA vaccines will be offered to all vaccinated people, LACDPH is continuing to work with staff and residents at skilled nursing facilities to prioritize these most vulnerable residents for booster doses so we are prepared to administer these as soon as the Food and Drug Administration gives their approval. FDA Approves License for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine FDA APPROVES LICENSE FOR PFIZER-BIOTECH COVID-19 VACCINE On August 25, 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the license for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for the prevention of COVD-19 disease in individuals 16 years of age and older. The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine continues to be available under emergency use authorization (EUA) for those 12 through 15 years old and for a third dose in certain immunocompromised individuals. The licensing approval was made after another thorough evaluation of safety and effectiveness data by a panel of scientific and medical experts. FDA-approved vaccines undergo the agency's standard process for reviewing the quality, safety and effectiveness of medical products. We are grateful to the many scientists and researchers who have worked tirelessly to develop and evaluate the vaccines during the most challenging public health crisis of our lifetime. We are also grateful to the FDA for their thoughtful analyses and review processes to ensure that we can have the highest confidence that the vaccine is safe and effective. The COVID-19 vaccine remains the most powerful tool we have to both lower our risk of infection and protect against serious illness and death from COVID-19 if infected. We encourage everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated - it is the most important step you can take to protect yourself, your loved ones, and our LA County community and to ultimately end this pandemic.

VA GREATER LOS ANGELES HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OFFERS VACCINES TO VETERANS OF ALL AGES VA GREATER LOS ANGELES HEALTHCARE SYSTEM OFFERS VACCINES TO VETERANS OF ALL AGES VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (VAGLAHS) announces that it is now offering COVID-19 vaccines to Veterans of all ages. VAGLAHS now has a steady supply of vaccines and the capacity to vaccinate at a greater rate. Because of these two factors, VAGLAHS is no longer offering vaccines based on priority groups, but is offering vaccines to all Veterans eligible for Veterans Health Administration (VHA) healthcare and enrolled with VAGLAHS. Veterans are encouraged to call the VAGLAHS COVID-19 Vaccine Appointment Line at (310) 268-4900 to schedule an appointment. There is also a self-scheduling option for Veterans using MyHealtheVet, VHA's personal online health record management system. VAGLAHS will continue to employ a \"fast track\" process to ensure Veterans in high-risk categories will have access to appointments with minimal wait times. Veterans having trouble getting an appointment should reach out to their primary care provider. Veterans who are ineligible for a vaccine at this time are, Veterans with an allergy to a component of the vaccine, Veterans with an active COVID infection (infection diagnosed in the last 20 days. Veteran may receive vaccine once 20 days have passed from the time of diagnosis), and Veterans who have received antibody therapy for COVID in the last 90 days. Primary and Secondary Caregivers of Veterans who are formally enrolled and participating in the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) are also eligible to receive a vaccination at VAGLAHS facilities.

FIND OUT IF IT'S YOUR TURN TO RECEIVE THE COVID-19 VACCINE FIND OUT IF IT'S YOUR TURN TO RECEIVE THE COVID-19 VACCINE While COVID-19 vaccine supply is still limited, California is prioritizing vaccines for specific groups based on exposure risks, health risks, and health equity. My Turn is where you can find out if it's your turn to get vaccinated and schedule vaccination appointments. If it isn't your turn yet, you can register to be notified when you become eligible. MyTurn.CA.GOV is a pilot site. Healthcare workers and individuals 65+ in Los Angeles and San Diego Counties can book appointments immediately. Online appointment scheduling for other groups and residents of other counties will be available soon. To check your eligibility for the COVID-19 vaccine, visit [MyTurn.CA.GOV](https://myturn.ca.gov/). PEOPLE 65 YEARS AND OLDER ARE NOW ELIGIBLE FOR A FREE COVID-19 VACCINATION (1/19/21) 1/19/21 PEOPLE 65 YEARS AND OLDER ARE NOW ELIGIBLE FOR A FREE COVID-19 VACCINATION Los Angeles County residents who are 65 years old and older can now register for COVID-19 vaccination appointments. Residents in this high-priority age group should visit [VaccinateLACounty.com](http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/vaccine/index.htm)to schedule their appointments, which will begin Wednesday, January 20th. Residents who don't have computer access may call (833) 540-0473 between 8 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. for assistance with reservations. The vaccine supply is still extremely limited, and Los Angeles County continues to urge patience as we work urgently with our federal and state partners to expand capacity and supply in the weeks ahead. To ensure that people at higher risk of transmission and illness are vaccinated first, Los Angeles County has established a tier system. In addition to those 65+, priority for current vaccination is going to frontline health care workers and residents and staff at skilled nursing and long-term care facilities. This strategy works to protect our entire community by ensuring that our most vulnerable and most critical healthcare workers do not get sick. The opening of appointment registration for a new tier today comes as the County opens five large capacity vaccination sites across the County. The five established sites, which were chosen for their regional accessibility and their ability to handle large capacities of people, are: - Pomona Fairplex, 1101 W McKinley Ave., Pomona, Forum, 3900 W Manchester Blvd., Inglewood, CA 90305 - California State University, Northridge, 18111 Nordhoff St., Northridge, CA 91330 - L.A. County Office of Education, 12830 Columbia Way, Downey, CA 90242 - Six Flags Magic Mountain, 26101 Magic Mountain Pkwy., Valencia, CA 91355 These large-scale vaccination sites started operating Tuesday, January 19, and will be able to vaccinate approximately 4,000 people per day at each site, significantly increasing the number of people vaccinated. The large-scale vaccination sites will aim to vaccinate 500,000 Los Angeles County residents in a month. Vaccinations are free, and available to all, regardless of immigration status or insurance coverage. For those who have insurance, coverage information may be requested as part of the appointment scheduling process. In addition to the L.A. County operated sites, residents have other options for making an appointment for a vaccine. Currently, more than 75 pharmacies have registered to provide vaccinations, and we will continue to add more as more vaccines are available. Vaccine allocations are also going to large healthcare provider organizations like Kaiser Permanente and Providence Health and Services. In addition, residents may call their healthcare provider, as well, who may direct them to a preferred location for the vaccine.

COVID-19 VACCINE INFORMATION - WWW.VACCINATELACOUNTY.COM THE LOS ANGLES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS PUBLISHED A NEW WEBPAGE FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ON THE COVID-19 VACCINE [http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/vaccine/index.htm](http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/vaccine/index.htm) The webpage includes: - FAQs - Responses to myths and misinformation - Information about scams - A place to sign up for email updates - A [Vaccine Distribution](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/covidvaccinedistribution/)page that explains the phases and tiers of distribution - A [PHASE 1A COVID-19 VACCINE MANAGEMENT DASHBOARD](http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus/vaccine/vaccine-dashboard.htm)where people can track how much vaccine has been distributed - And more! Key information from these webpages is provided below: Who Will Get Vaccine When The [Vaccine Distribution](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/covidvaccinedistribution/)page describes the phases and tiers of vaccination, with more information about how these phases may roll out. Green circles show groups of people who have been, or are being, offered vaccine. Red circles show groups who are waiting to be offered vaccine. This page is being updated regularly as the groups within each phase and tier are further refined. How the phases and tiers were determined Vaccine eligibility is determined by phases of prioritization developed by the [Centers for Disease Control (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html)through the [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/), as well as guidance developed by the [State](https://staging.covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/#When-can-I-get-vaccinated)via the [California Department of Public Health (CDPH)](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/CDPH-Allocation-Guidelines-for-COVID-19-Vaccine-During-Phase-1A-Recommendations.aspx). This planning is occurring in close coordination with state and local health departments to ensure appropriate planning and collaboration with community partners. Allocation policies will be dynamic and will be adapted based on vaccine performance, vaccine supply and demand, and other factors. Where we are currently We are currently administering vaccines in Phase 1A, Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3. Phase 1A focuses on vaccinating frontline health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities, in alignment with the recommendations of the ACIP based on risks of exposure and risks for severe illness. It is estimated that everyone in Phase 1A will have been offered at least one dose of vaccine by late January/early February. Please note that timings are estimates and may change according to factors such as vaccine supply and the state prioritization requirements. The phases and tiers will overlap. What future phases will look like Phase 1B vaccination efforts will focus on vaccinating persons aged 75 years and frontline essential workers and Phase 1C will focus on vaccinating persons aged 65-74 years, persons aged 16-64 years with high-risk medical conditions, and other essential workers. Please note that current Phase 1B and 1C distribution is based on CDC guidance and may be changed or updated by CDPH. The [Vaccine Distribution](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/acd/ncorona2019/covidvaccinedistribution/)page will remain updated to reflect any developments. How Vaccine Will Get to People in Later Phases When vaccine is available to other groups of people, it will likely be given at: - Primary care clinics - Pharmacies - Some workplaces, and - Special vaccination sites run by Public Health and county, city, and community partners No one will have to pay for the vaccine. A doctor or pharmacy may charge a fee for giving the vaccine, but it should be covered by public and private insurance companies. People without health insurance can get COVID-19 vaccines at no cost. There are no out-of-pocket payments. While, with the exception of health care workers, there is no way to register or sign up to receive the vaccine at this time, plans are currently being developed at CDC for how persons within these broad groupings will be prioritized and how the vaccines will be delivered. To support local planning processes, the County has established a COVID-19 Vaccine Work Group, comprised of approximately 100 individuals representing more than 60 organizations, with committees focused on ensuring equitable distribution of the vaccine, establishing effective communications, and aligning resources.

Vaccine providers in Los Angeles County with doses of the Janssen vaccine were authorized to resume administration of the vaccine as of April 24, 2021, provided they distribute the [updated Janssen fact sheet](https://ci.san-fernando.ca.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ADM_Coronavirus-Update-5-3-21-ATT-C.pdf)to any recipients of the vaccine. LOS ANGELES COUNTY PAUSES USE OF JOHNSON & JOHNSON VACCINE Out of an abundance of caution, Los Angeles County is following the recommendation of the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to pause the use of Johnson & Johnson vaccine after reports that six women between the ages of 18 and 48 developed unusual types of blood clots 6 to 13 days after receiving the vaccine. This pause will last until the FDA and CDC complete their review, which is expected to take several days. Vaccine providers in LA County will contact patients about rescheduling or providing a new appointment for Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. These reactions are extremely rare, as nearly 7,000,000 people have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in the United States to date. People who received the vaccine in the last 3 weeks should look for any symptoms of these unusual clots, including severe headaches, abdominal or leg pain, and shortness of breath, and contact their medical provider if symptoms develop. People who don't have a medical provider can call 2-1-1 to connect with a healthcare provider.

According to the CDC, LA County's daily increase in cases to the high level where we are now puts us in the category of \"Substantial transmission\". Considering that LA County has reported over 1,000 new cases a day over the last 7 days, this daily average case rate is at a substantial community transmission level without the 7-day lag. For this reason, LA County (including the City of San Fernando) will be implementing an order requiring masking indoors regardless of vaccination status that will go into effect at 11:59p on Saturday, July 17, 2021. Wearing a mask when indoors with others reduces the risk of both getting and transmitting the virus. Masking indoors must again become a normal practice by all, regardless of vaccination status, so that we can stop the trends and level of transmission we are currently seeing. Some exceptions will apply, and these will be similar to masking requirements that were in place prior to June 15, 2021. This order is expected to remain in place until LA County begins to see improvements in community transmission of COVID-19. But waiting for LA County to be at high community transmission before making a change would be too late. Modifications to the Health Order: - Requires face masks to be worn by all persons, regardless of vaccination status, while in all indoor public settings and businesses. - Continues to urge everyone, especially those who are not or cannot be vaccinated against COVID-19, to continue to exercise caution and good judgement as community transmission of COVID-19 is rapidly increased from low to substantial transmission in one month.

Temporary Targeted Safer at Home Health Officer Order for Control of COVID-19: Tier 1 Substantial Surge Response (11/28/20) 11/28/20 TEMPORARY TARGETED SAFER AT HOME HEALTH OFFICER ORDER FOR CONTROL OF COVID-19: TIER 1 SUBSTANIAL SURGE RESPONSE This Temporary Targeted Safer at Home Order for Control of COVID-19: Tier 1 Substantial Surge Response (Temporary Order) is issued to temporarily replace the most recently issued Reopening Safer At Work and In The Community For Control of COVID-19 Order issued by the County of Los Angeles Health Officer. This Temporary Order will be effective from 12:01 am on November 30, 2020 to 11:59 pm on December 20, 2020. This Temporary Order is issued as a response to the recent substantial rise in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Over the last five calendar days, the County of Los Angeles is averaging over 4,500 newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases per day. Between November 13, 2020 and November 27, 2020, hospitalizations of confirmed COVID-19 patients have increased by 101% to 1,893. The Health Officer expects both the number of new cases and hospitalizations to continue to rapidly increase over the next 21 days. Without rapid public health interventions, continued and substantial increases in both cases and hospitalizations will stress the health care system. This stress will limit availability of Intensive Care Unit beds for non-COVID-19 hospitalizations. This Temporary Order is issued to ensure that County of Los Angeles residents, including the City of San Fernando, remain in their residences as much as practicable, to limit close contact with others outside their household in both indoor and outdoor spaces and to further reduce the risk of community transmission of COVID-19 resulting from the unprecedented surge of daily cases. This Temporary Order is issued to reduce capacity at sites where non-household members interact. Limiting interactions among non-household members, especially in places where persons are in close proximity without a face covering or mask, is essential to slowing the spread of COVID-19. It is imperative that all persons and businesses within the County take personal responsibility and follow all restrictions and infection control precautions by this Temporary Order. This Temporary Order is effective November 30, 2020 and will continue for 21 days. - GATHERINGS: All public and private gatherings with individuals not in your household are prohibited, except for church services and protests. - OCCUPANCY LIMITS (all individuals at these sites are required to wear face coverings and keep at least 6 feet of distance): - Essential Retail - 35% maximum occupancy - Non-essential Retail (including indoor malls) - 25% maximum occupancy - Personal Care Services - 20% maximum occupancy - Libraries - 30% maximum occupancy - Fitness Centers Operating Outdoors - 50% maximum occupancy - Museums, Galleries, Zoos, Aquariums, Botanical Gardens Operating Outdoors - 50% maximum occupancy - Mini-golf, batting cages, go-kart racing operating outdoors - 50% maximum occupancy - - SCHOOLS: All schools and day camps remain open adhering to re-opening protocols. - CLOSED NON-ESSENTIAL BUSINESS/ACTIVITIES: Playgrounds (with exception of playgrounds at childcare and schools) and cardrooms. - OUTDOOR RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES (all which require face coverings, except for swimming, and distancing): - Beaches, trails and parks remain open; gatherings at these sites with members outside your household are prohibited. - Golf courses, tennis courts, pickleball, archery ranges, skate parks, bike parks, and community gardens remain open for individuals or members of a single household. Pools that serve more than one household may open only for regulated lap swimming with one person per lane. - Drive-in Movies/events/care parades are permitted provided occupants in each care are members of one household.

This order does not apply to persons experiencing homelessness. Nothing in this order prevents any number of persons from the same household from leaving their residence, lodging, or temporary accommodation, as long as they do not engage in any interaction with (or otherwise gather with) any number of persons from any other household, except as specifically permitted herein. This Limited Stay at Home Order will reduce opportunities for disease transmission with the goal of decreasing the number of hours individuals are in the community and mixing with individuals outside of their household. Every intervention to decrease mixing of households is critical during this unparalleled increase in case rate rise of about 50 percent during the first week in November. In particular, activities conducted during 10:00pm to 5:00am are often non-essential and more likely related to social activities and gatherings that have a higher likelihood of leading to reduced inhibition and reduced likelihood to adhere to COVID-19 preventive measures (e.g., wearing face coverings and maintaining physical distance). This order shall take effect on November 21, 2020, at 10:00pm PST. For counties that move into Tier One (Purple) after the effective date of this Order, the terms of this Order shall apply at 10:00pm PST on day two after the county is assigned to Tier One (Purple). For the purpose of counting days, day one shall be the first full day following the date of the tier assignment. This order remains in effect until 5:00am PST on December 21, 2020, and may be extended or revised as needed. This order is issued pursuant to Health and Safety Code sections authority provided for under the Emergency Services Act; and other applicable law. Erica S.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Public Health), in consultation with the Board of Supervisors, will revise the Health Officer Order to allow for limited in-door operations at nail salons and shopping malls, outdoor operations for cardrooms, re-opening of outside playgrounds and the school waiver program for grades TK-2. The following sectors and program will be allowed to reopen on the following dates under the following restrictions: Sector - Date of Reopening - Restrictions - Nail Salons - October 1, 2020: Indoor services may resume at 25% capacity. Outdoor services should continue as much as possible. - Schools (TK-2) Waiver Program - Applications can be submitted on October 5, 2020: Limited to 30 schools per week. - Cardrooms - October 5, 2020: Outdoor operations only. Food and beverages may not be served at the tables. - Indoor Shopping Malls - October 7, 2020: Occupancy limited to 25% capacity; all food courts and all common areas remain closed. - Outside Playgrounds - At the discretion of cities and the County Parks and Recreation Department. All parents and children age 2 and older who use playgrounds in the County must always wear a cloth face covering, there is no eating or drinking allowed at the playground, and parents are encouraged to monitor their children to ensure that they maintain a 6-foot physical distance from other children not in their households and that they take infection control procedures. Indoor playgrounds do remain closed. Exceptions are playgrounds located at childcare facilities. Public Health is consulting with County Counsel to determine the process and date for re-opening outdoor operations at breweries and wineries serving a meal. We anticipate this process will be completed in a week. Beginning Monday, October 5, school waiver applications for in-person instruction for students in grades TK-2 will be available online at [www.publichealth.lacounty.gov](http://www.publichealth.lacounty.gov/). Applications will be received and reviewed by Public Health in consultation with the State. Schools must follow all required school re-opening protocols for infection control, distancing, and cohorting. Students will be in cohorts of no more than 12 children and two supervising adults in each classroom. This group of students and adults will need to stay together throughout the entire day for all activities. Every school that re-opens will receive a site visit from Public Health. Public Health has a dedicated team of specialists providing technical assistance and disease management control to all schools that are re-opened or re-opening. Comprehensive protocols for all sectors that reopen will be posted online to ensure the continued health and safety of workers and the community. Businesses are required to implement the protocols for infection control and distancing prior to reopening to ensure they are in compliance, and to avoid citations, fines and possible closure. Businesses have a duty to protect employees, customers and residents from COVID-19 as much as possible and to follow Public Health protocols and directives. It is important for everyone to follow the directives and to do their part every day to keep everyone as safe as possible.

SCHOOL SERVICES Beginning Monday, September 14, 2020, K-12 schools may offer in-school services for small cohorts of (up to 12) students with: - Individualized Education Plans (IEP); - Requiring instruction for English as a Second Language; - Or needing assessments or specialized in-school services as long as the school is able to fully implement the Health Officer's guidance and protocols and submits an operational plan. This change will get children who are in the most need of in-person learning back into their classrooms.

LA County will not be opening the waiver program for instruction of students in grades TK-6 as we monitor the implementation of this effort to safely get students needing specialized in-school services back at school. HAIR SALONS AND BARBERSHOPS In addition to limited in-school services, the HOO has been revised to allow increased access to hair salons & barbershops. LA County's Department of Public Health issued the [Reopening Protocol for Hair Salons & Barbershops](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDMsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMDA5MDIuMjY0NzQ0MTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwOi8vcHVibGljaGVhbHRoLmxhY291bnR5Lmdvdi9tZWRpYS9Db3JvbmF2aXJ1cy9kb2NzL3Byb3RvY29scy9SZW9wZW5pbmdfSGFpclNhbG9uc19CYXJiZXJzaG9wcy5wZGY_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9JnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX25hbWU9JnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9Z292ZGVsaXZlcnkmdXRtX3Rlcm09In0.Iwxbh37tal-c4SRrTqSzn_JvVywMsga4uWFjTxbH-lw/s/753909644/br/83135569698-l). Once reviewed, hair salons & barbershops can re-open for indoor services at 25% occupancy, provided they are in full compliance with the County's protocols - which includes physical distancing and face coverings for both employees and customers, among other requirements. If your hair salon or barbershop has been operating outdoors, please continue to do so and use your 25% occupancy for those services you are not able to provide outdoors. All other current restrictions remain unchanged at this time. As LA County slowly reopens sectors, reopenings and how they impact community transmission will be watched closely. LA County does not want to experience the significant spikes in cases, hospitalizations and deaths seen in July after re-openings and holidays.

The above graphic is a summary of: 1) the state's tiers, 2) the indicators they are tracking, and 3) how counties are being classified (as having either widespread, substantial, moderate or minimal spread of the COVID-19 virus in their communities). Moving forward, California will use this new tier system to guide possible sector re-openings for counties to consider. WHAT DOES THE NEW FRAMEWORK MEAN FOR LA COUNTY (INCLUDING THE CITY OF SAN FERNANDO)? In LA County, the ultimate decisions about sector re-openings will remain under the purview of the County Health Officer Orders, which are developed in consultation with LA County's Board of Supervisors. As demonstrated by the below graphic, LA County is currently in Tier 1 - meaning that there continues to be widespread transmission of the virus in the county. Per the State, LA County's current number of 7-day average of new cases (per day per 100,000 people) is 13 - nearly double the threshold for moving up to Tier 2 (which requires that LA County have less than 7 new cases per day per 100,000 population). LA County's current test positivity rate is 5%. And even though this places us in Tier 2 (Red) for this metric, when the two metrics fall in different tiers, the State places counties in the most restrictive tier; hence, LA County (like most counties in California) has been placed in Tier 1. Our path forward for reopening depends on LA County being able to reduce community transmission significantly, so children and teachers can get back to their classrooms and more people can get back to their jobs with as much safety as possible.

Such declaration grants specific duties to the officers and employees of the City as set forth in Chapter 26 Section 63. Since that time several additional measures have been taken by the State of California and the City of San Fernando to protect the public from an undue risk of contracting COVID-19. On March 21, 2020, the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health (the \"Health Department\") first issued the \"Safer at Home Order for the Control of COVID-19\" (the \"Safer at Home Order\") and has issued a succession of updated iterations to the same since with the most recent iteration of the Safe at Home Order being issued on July 18, 2020. The term \"Safer at Home Order\" means the most current iteration of the aforementioned order of the Health Department, inclusive of any related guidance material relating to the same. By virtue of authority vested in me as the Director of Emergency Services, pursuant to the provisions of the San Fernando Municipal Code Chapter 26 Section 63(a)(6)(a) to \"make and issue rules and regulations on matters reasonably related to the protection of life and property as affected by such emergency\", I hereby declare the following orders to be necessary for the protection of life and property and hereby order: - The swap meet located at 585 Glenoaks Boulevard in the City of San Fernando and commonly referred to as San Fernando Swap Meet (the \"Swap Meet\") is subject to the County of Los Angeles Protocols for Shopping Centers: Appendix E of the Safer at Home Order. - In addition to the Protocols for Shopping Centers, the Swap Meet is hereby required to adhere to the following added operational conditions above and beyond those set forth in the Safe at Home Order as of the date of this order of the City: - In addition to the informational signage called for under the Safer at Home Order, Swap Meet operations shall post additional informational signage notifying Swap Meet patrons and vendors of applicable social distancing protocols, proper way to wear a mask, and location of handwashing/ sanitation stations. The additional signage shall be posted conspicuously at the entrance and exit of each row of booths that are being used by vendors for the purpose of selling goods on any given day. - Swap Meet operators shall provide additional handwashing stations at each entrance to the Swap Meet, at the exterior of each restroom facility, and another 4 (1 per 100,000 square feet of retail space) handwashing stations distributed throughout the grounds of the Swap Meet during business hours. - Swap Meet operators will limit people capacity to a maximum of 50% of the persons capacity authorized by the Fire Marshall at any given time during business hours (\"persons\" includes customers, vendors, and staff). The Swap Meet operators shall also limit the number of vendors allowed to operate at the Swap Meet at any given time to 50% of the total number of vendor stalls available to vendors. - - Although the Safer at Home Order permitted the resumption of swap meet operations in the County of Los Angeles effective as of May 26, 2020 subject to conditions and guidance stated in the Safer at Home Order, I hereby find that circumstances and factors specific to the Swap Meet's operations in San Fernando warrant more stringent regulation than what is called for under the Safer at Home Order. It is also observed that the Safer at Home Order by its own terms authorizes cities to implement more stringent regulations than those called for under the Safer at Home Order. The specific circumstances and factors that warrant the closure of the Swap Meet are as follows: - The Swap Meet is not considered an \"Essential Business\" under the State and County of Los Angeles Health Orders. - The Swap Meet provides the potential for a large gathering of people that may further community spread of COVID-19. - As of July 29, 2020, the City of San Fernando has a high concentration of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. - 594 confirmed cases; equal to 2,413 per 100,000 residents (65th of 88 incorporated cities and unincorporated areas in Los Angeles County). - 14 confirmed deaths; equal to 57 per 100,000 residents (69th of 88 incorporated cities and unincorporated areas in Los Angeles County). Any violation of this order shall be enforced by Section 1-10 of the San Fernando Municipal Code which allows a maximum fine of $1,000 or a maximum of six months imprisonment. Each infidel officer should use their discretion in enforcing this order and always keep the intent of the order in mind. This order shall be effective at 11:59 p.m. on August 3, 2020 and shall remain in effect until 11:59 p.m. on August 20, 2020. This order may be extended or rescinded by the Director of Emergency Services, in writing, prior to August 20, 2020.

Download Safer at Work and in the Community Health Order (7/4/20): [ENGLISH](https://ci.san-fernando.ca.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2020.07.01_HO-Order_COVID-19_Safer-at-Work-and-in-the-Community_updatedappendices.pdf) Governor Newsom Orders Additional Action to Slow Community Transmission: Closure of Indoor Operations (7/1/20) 7/1/20 GOVERNOR NEWSOM ORDERS ADDITIONAL ACTION TO SLOW COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION Number: NR20-143 Contact: [CDPHpress@cdph.ca.gov] Counties on Monitoring List for 3 Days or More Must Prohibit Indoor Operations in Certain Sectors for a Minimum of 3 Weeks Businesses May Modify Operations to Provide Outdoor Services or Pick-up SACRAMENTO - Governor Gavin Newsom and the California Department of Public Health today released [guidance](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Guidance-on-Closure-of-Sectors-in-Response-to-COVID-19.aspx)directing counties that have been on the [County Monitoring List](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx)for three consecutive days or more to close indoor operations for certain sectors which promote the mixing of populations beyond households and make adherence to physical distancing and wearing face coverings difficult. The guidance applies for a minimum of three weeks and is subject to an extension based on epidemiologic indicators. These sectors may modify operations to provide services outside or by pick-up. In addition, all brewpubs, breweries, bars, and pubs in these counties must close immediately, both indoor and outdoor. Today's guidance applies to the following sectors: - Indoor Dine-in restaurants - Indoor Wineries and Tasting Rooms - Indoor Family Entertainment Centers - Indoor Movie Theaters - Indoor Zoos and Museums - Indoor Cardrooms \"California is seeing the virus spreading at alarming rates in many parts of the state, and we are taking immediate action to slow the spread of the virus in those areas,\" said Governor Newsom. \"We bent the curve in the state of California once, and we will bend the curve again. But we're going to have to be tougher, and that's why we are taking this action today.\" Community spread of COVID-19 continues to be a concern across the state, and in particular for counties on the County Monitoring List. This puts vulnerable populations, including older Californians and those who have chronic conditions or compromised immune systems, at higher risk of becoming seriously ill due to the virus. \"Today's action is necessary to help slow the spread of this virus,\" said Dr. Sonia Angell, State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health. \"We put ourselves and our community at greatest risk for COVID 19 when we mix with people who don't live with us. And if you go out, wear a face covering, keep your distance, wash your hands frequently and limit unnecessary indoor activities that increase the risk of exposure.\" Today's order applies to counties that have been on the County Monitoring List for three or more consecutive days. Combined these 19 counties represent approximately 72% of California's population. Impacted Counties as of July 1, 2020 - Contra Costa - Fresno - Glenn - Imperial - Kern - Kings - Los Angeles - Merced - Orange - Riverside - Sacramento - San Bernardino - San Joaquin - Santa Barbara - Santa Clara - Solano - Stanislaus - Tulare - Ventura Sectors included in today's guidance are all high risk of transmission due to a number of features of the businesses and the behaviors that occur within them. These sectors, foundationally, are settings where groups convene and may mix with others for prolonged periods of time often without a face covering. Additionally, physical movement within the establishment, duration of time spent in the establishment, and the degree of social mixing among individuals and groups outside one's household are all significant in these sectors, which substantially elevates the risk of transmission even where face coverings can be worn. Furthermore, in some of these sectors centered on eating and drinking, compliance with face coverings is not possible for the full duration of time someone spends in these establishments. California will continue to update and issue guidance based on the best available public health data and the best practices currently employed. All industry or sector guidance documents that have been issued to date, including all infectious control measures outlined in those guidance documents, apply in outdoor settings, and thus must be adhered to. Finally, as we approach the 4th of July holiday weekend, California is recommending that counties with mandatory closures cancel firework shows, and is reminding all Californians that they should not gather with people they do not live with and avoid crowds. Additionally, all parking facilities at state beaches in Southern California and the Bay Area will be closed for the upcoming weekend. In counties that close local beaches, the State will follow suit and close state beaches. Other state parks will remain open, with measures in place to reduce visitation and limit overcrowding.

Although overall case counts are increasing as testing becomes more widespread and there is more community transmission, the County continues to see steady decreases in the rate of COVID-19 infections and virus-related hospitalizations and deaths. Today, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Public Health) announced that the Health Officer Order will be modified to include infection control and distancing requirements for re-opening the following sectors on Friday, June 19: - Nail salons - Cosmetology services - Spas offering aesthetic and massage services - Tattoo and piercing shops - Tanning salons - Casinos, card rooms and satellite wagering sites - Bar and wineries not anchored to food services These businesses will be able to open, in some cases at limited capacity, once they have the appropriate infection control and distancing requirements in place. In addition, protests and faith-based services held outdoors will no longer have limits on how many people can participate, starting Friday. Public health guidance documents will be posted here as soon as they are available: [publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/Coronavirus](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDMsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMDA2MTkuMjMxOTMwMDEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwOi8vcHVibGljaGVhbHRoLmxhY291bnR5Lmdvdi9tZWRpYS9Db3JvbmF2aXJ1cy8_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9JnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX25hbWU9JnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9Z292ZGVsaXZlcnkmdXRtX3Rlcm09In0.BXXYAqt0LgWX26YR6BGUnvF6voKvNRe_vOYNHGzZHU0/s/832940554/br/80057984539-l). The County continues to actively monitor the spread of the virus and the capacity of the healthcare system to provide residents with essential services. COVID-19 is still present in Los Angeles County, and the threat of this deadly virus remains. However, the County is in line with State of California guidelines, and our key metrics reflect that compliance. Los Angeles County's seven-day death average has not increased, the three-day hospitalization average is down five percent and the seven-day testing average is well above the State's requirement at 17,000 tests conducted per day. In addition, the positivity rate is eight percent, which is in line with the State's requirements.

Residents must continue to practice physical distancing, wear cloth face coverings and follow Public Health directives. If at any time the County's rate of infection and other key metrics demonstrate a rapid acceleration of new cases that threatens to overwhelm the healthcare system, the Public Health and the Board of Supervisors may need to limit future re-openings or close reopened sectors. Getting a manicure, a massage or a tattoo, or going to a card room will be a different experience than it was before the pandemic. Each sector reopening will have strict infection control directives in place. Please see below for highlights from each sector. Just as is required for all out-of-home activities, visitors and staff will have to practice physical distancing and wear cloth face coverings. There will be limited capacity and enhanced cleaning and disinfecting procedures. People feeling sick should stay home. These additional re-openings follow other significant elements of the economy and community that have begun reopening and operating with limits and safeguards, including gyms, day camps, museums, spectator-free sports, hair salons, barber shops, religious services, retail, restaurants, beaches and trails. Still closed are movie theaters, live performance theaters, entertainment centers, concert halls and venues, stadiums, arenas, gaming facilities, theme parks, lounges and nightclubs, hot tubs, steam rooms and saunas not located on a residential property and festivals.

Such declaration grants specific duties to the officers and employees of the City as set forth in Chapter 26 Section 63. Since that time several additional measures have been taken by the State of California and the City of San Fernando to protect the public from an undue risk of contracting COVID-19. On March 21, 2020, the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health (the \"Health Department\") issued the \"Safer at Home Order for the Control of COVID-19\" (the \"Safer at Home Order\"), which identifies so-called Essential Businesses that are permitted to remain open subject to certain restrictions, including adherence to variance infection control precautions. For purposes of this Order, the term \"Essential Business\" shall have the same meaning as set forth under Section 13 of the Safer at Home Order as the same may be amended or otherwise interpreted by the Health Department. The Safer at Home Order at page 1 provides that it \"does not supersede any stricter limitation imposed by a local public entity\" On April 7, 2020, Mayor Garcetti for the City of Los Angeles issued a Worker Protection Order, ordering furthering protections for non-medical essential works, including, but not limited to, mandatory face covering for workers and patrons. As the City is completely encircled within the City of Los Angeles and contracts with the City of Los Angeles for fire protection services coordination and consistency with the City of Los Angeles on protocols for protecting the public is both reasonable and efficient and will avoid confusion and inconsistency. By virtue of authority vested in me as the Director of Emergency Services, pursuant to the provisions of the San Fernando Municipal Code Chapter 26 Section 63(a)(6)(a) to \"make and issue rules and regulations on matters reasonably related to the protection of life and property as affected by such emergency\", I hereby declare the following orders to be necessary for the protection of life and property and hereby order: - This Order shall apply to the following Essential Businesses operating in the City of San Fernando, all workers working at such Essential Business and all customers patronizing such Essential Businesses in person: - Grocery stores, certified farmers' markets, farm and produce stands, supermarkets, food banks, convenience stores, warehouse stores, and other establishments engaged in the retail sale of canned food, dry goods, fresh fruit and vegetables, pet supply, water, fresh meats, fish, and poultry, and any other household consumer products (such as cleaning or personal care products).

The guidance does not require people to wear face coverings - and is not a substitute for the state's current guidance regarding social distancing and hand washing. The state also does not recommend Californians use N-95 or surgical masks, which are needed for our health care workers and first responders who will be there for when our lives at risk. \"Face coverings are not a substitute for physical distancing or frequent hand washing, which we know are amongst the most effective ways to reduce the spread of COVID-19,\" said Dr. Sonia Angell, Director of the California Department of Public Health and State Health Officer. \"Wearing a cloth face covering could provide some additional benefit by acting as a reminder for other people to keep their distance, and it could help reduce the spread of infectious particles from those who could be infected but don't have symptoms.\" \"Face coverings could provide some additional protection against COVID-19, but Californians should not have a false sense of security if they choose to wear them. Make sure you're also staying 6 feet away from other people if you have to leave your home to get groceries or prescriptions,\" said California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly. The new guidance reminds Californians that the best defense against COVID-19 continues to be: - Staying at home and physical distancing - Washing hands frequently - Avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands - Avoiding being around sick people The use of cloth face coverings could reduce the transmission of COVID-19 by individuals who do not have symptoms and may reinforce physical distancing. Public health officials also caution that face coverings may increase risk if users reduce their use of strong defenses such as physical distancing and frequent hand washing.

Los Angeles County Health Officer Issues New Orders Directing Self-Quarantine and Self-Isolation (3/27/20) (3/27/20) LOS ANGELES COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER ISSUES NEW ORDERS DIRECTING SELF-QUARANTINE AND SELF ISOLATION On March 25, 2020, in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, protect vulnerable individuals, and prevent the Los Angeles County healthcare system from being overwhelmed, the LA County Health Officer has issued two new separate orders: - Self-quarantine of anyone exposed to an individual diagnosed with or likely to have COVID-19. - Self-isolation of anyone diagnosed with or showing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 within 14 days of being in close contact with a person who had or was believed to have COVID-19. These new Orders ensure that individuals who test positive for COVID-19, and those who are told by a clinician they are presumed to be positive for COVID-19 are required to self-isolate for a period of at least 3 days without symptoms, including being fever free without taking medicine, and 7 days since symptoms started, whichever is longer. Additionally, those who have been in close contact with someone who is positive or presumed positive must quarantine themselves for 14 days from the last time they had contact with the ill person. \"It is critically important that everyone adheres to all the social distancing measures and practice good public health hygiene, including washing hands as frequently as possible,\" said Dr. Barbara Ferrer, Director of the L.A. County Department of Public Health. \"Individuals covered by these Orders should still contact their providers to get advice if they feel their symptoms are worsening.\" There are key differences between self-quarantine and self-isolation. Here's what the new orders mean for you: SELF-QUARANTINE ORDER (EXPOSED) - Required for anyone exposed to a person diagnosed with or likely to have COVID-19. - You must stay in quarantine for 14 days from the last time you had contact with the ill person. - You cannot leave your place of quarantine for all 14 days. - Only exception to leave quarantine is to receive medical care. - If you develop even mild COVID-19 symptoms, you must self-isolate at home and away from others. SELF-ISOLATION ORDER (DIAGNOSED) - Required for anyone diagnosed with or showing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 within 14 days of being in close contact with a person who had or was believed to have COVID-19. - Self-isolation period must last at least 3 days without symptoms, including being fever free without taking medicine, and 7 days since symptoms started, whichever is longer. - Notify anyone you've had close contact with while symptomatic to self-quarantine themselves.

Due to the continued rapid spread of COVID-19 and the need to protect the most vulnerable members of our community, the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health has called upon everyone to stay at home or in their place of residence, except when they need to work at an Essential Business or Healthcare Operation, provide Essential Infrastructure, shop at an Essential Business, or engage in an Essential Activity. FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT THEY SHOULD: - Stay home (stay unexposed and do not expose others) - Only go out for essential services or if they are an essential worker - Stay six feet or more away from others - Not gather in groups THE ORDER, WHICH IS IN EFFECT UNTIL APRIL 19, 2020, SPECIFICALLY: - Prohibits all indoor and outdoor public and private gatherings and events among persons not in the same household in Los Angeles County. - Requires all businesses to stop in-person operations and close to the public, unless the business is defined as an Essential Business. It specifically requires all indoor malls and shopping centers, all swap meets and flea markets, all indoor and outdoor playgrounds, and all non-essential businesses to close. - Requires Essential Businesses that are not required to close to the public to practice social distancing to the extent possible and infection control precautions listed in the Order. - Requires all restaurants to only prepare and offer food that is provided to customers via delivery service, via pick-up for takeout dining, and via drive-thru. Restaurants may not provide indoor or outdoor table service. This Order doesn't prevent any individual or family from engaging in passive recreational or outdoor activities, such as hiking, walking, jogging, or biking, so long as all persons practice social distancing to the extent possible.

Tenants have up to 180 days after the expiration of the deferment period, currently May 31, 2020, to repay all outstanding rent. To qualify, tenants must provide documentation of COVID-19 related impacts.

These efforts include a face-mask requirement at station platforms and aboard trains, enhanced cleaning and sanitizing measures, and partnerships with leading health and safety institutions for guidance on health matters.METROLINK RESTORES SERVICE OF TWO VENTURA COUNTY LINE TRAINS BEGINNING TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 2020 As traffic on the freeways serving the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County returns to pre-COVID levels, Metrolink is reinstating two morning trains to serve people who live and/or work in this area. Starting Tuesday, September 8, Ventura County Line trains 101 and 110 will return to Metrolink's schedule to serve stations connecting Los Angeles to Glendale, Burbank, Northridge, Van Nuys, Chatsworth, Simi Valley and Moorpark. Westbound train 101 will depart Union Station at 6:51 a.m. and arrive in Moorpark at 8:06 a.m., while the eastbound 110 will depart Moorpark at 8:28 a.m., arriving to Union Station at 9:41 a.m. The eastbound service provides the first morning connection from Los Angeles to Ventura County since the pandemic forced temporary service reductions in March. \"As we restore service, customer needs are a key factor influencing our planning,\" said Metrolink Board Chair Brian Humphrey. \"A rider brought to our attention there was no service to Ventura County in the morning. I commend our team for being customer-focused and making sure we fulfilled this critical need by offering these additional trains that will serve my home county, as well as the essential businesses of the San Fernando Valley.\" A recent Metrolink customer survey indicated 71 percent of current riders are essential workers employed by the region's healthcare, transportation and other critical industries. Also, nearly one-third responded they do not have a vehicle and rely on Metrolink service to get to essential jobs. Restoring service along these lines provides a necessary link for the region's workforce just as studies reveal that traffic is increasing to pre-COVID levels on U.S. Highway 101 and California State Route 118. \"Our service and schedules are all centered around the needs and safety of our customers,\" said Stephanie Wiggins, Metrolink CEO. \"We are heartened to see our ridership beginning to rebound and will continue to restore service in a measured and strategic fashion based on need, our ability to socially distance and available funding.\" Safety is foundational at Metrolink, so face masks are required aboard Metrolink trains and on station platforms. Metrolink has implemented enhanced deep cleaning protocols including the use of an electrostatic sprayer that mists each train car with hospital grade disinfectants every day, and an expanded Clean Care Crew that cleans, wipes down and disinfects trains throughout the day. Plus, people can be assured that there's plenty of space for social distancing by using the online tool [How Full is My Train?](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/metrolinktrains.com/howfull__;!!Kte0UvaLjQ!RPaCp3Qdg-GGL2DbiBbamejVw_1K9Y8d5zSu2MIOt9iA2dz1mC3V6nJoPo2N_6s$)where riders can check any train's recent ridership levels.

Metrolink immediately increased cleaning and disinfecting practices onboard trains - including cleaning and wiping down surfaces such as doors, restrooms and passenger areas. Metrolink understands the unique role they play in providing lifeline transportation services during times of need and have been taking care of the people who take care of people - including their own essential employees and will continue to do so. As communities began issuing Stay at Home orders, ridership has decreased significantly. As of Friday, March 20, Metrolink ridership demand was down 81% compared to the same day a year ago, with 7,139 riders using our system compared to 37,004 on March 20, 2019. In response to this, Metrolink has made the determination that it is time to temporarily reduce service beginning Thursday, March 26, 2020. Rider notification began on March 24, 2020. This decision was not taken lightly, as Metrolink is proud to provide vital transportation services to essential employees throughout Southern California. Their planned temporary 30% service reduction preserves the peak-hour service where they see the greatest proportion of remaining ridership, while avoiding the possibility of creating crowding situations on trains. Metrolink looked carefully at ridership on every line to ensure they allowed for enough service so riders can spread out and maintain the social distancing guidelines everyone is observing. For instance, the average load factor for the trains that will be annulled is 2.33%. Thank you for your continued support during these unprecedented times.

The relaxed residential street sweeping restrictions that went into effect on March 19, 2020 remain in effect. As a reminder, the 2-hour street sweeping parking restriction in the residential areas have been relaxed to allow street parking as soon as the street sweeper has gone through the area.CITY OF SAN FERNANDO ANNOUNCES SLIGHT CHANGES TO RESIDENTIAL STREET SWEEPING PARKING RESTRICTIONS Street sweeping in residential and commercial areas is a critical component for maintaining public hygiene, removing trash, keeping the City's storm drains clear of debris to avoid flooding, and reducing standing water. During this state of emergency, where public hygiene and cleanliness is of paramount importance, the City must continue to maintain regularly scheduled street sweeping services to protect public health. However, the City recognizes that the closure of schools, businesses, and the statewide directive to practice social distancing has resulted in more vehicles in our residential neighborhoods than usual. Therefore, effective Thursday, March 19, 2020, the City will relax the current 2-hour street sweeping parking restriction in the residential areas to allow street parking as soon as the street sweeper has gone through the area. Vehicles parked in a restricted area that block the street sweeper's ability to clean a particular area will continue to be subject to a fine. To reiterate, residents may move their vehicle and park on the restricted portion of the street after the sweeper has passed along the curb and cleaned the street. Please be sure the sweeper has cleaned the street before parking in the restricted parking zone. All other parking restrictions, including street sweeping parking restrictions in the commercial corridors, will remain in effect.PARKING RESTRICTIONS Currently, the City of San Fernando has not relaxed any parking restrictions; however, the policy is being reviewed and more information will be available in the coming days. - CITY OF SAN FERNANDO'S LOCAL EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM Alert San Fernando uses both text and voice messages to keep residents informed about emergencies and important issues like: REPUBLIC SERVICES (RECYCLING AND WASTE SERVICE) - Road Closures - Severe Weather - Utility Failures - Power Outages - Traffic Alerts - Missing Persons - And Much More!

The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is working to help consumers manage their energy bills and usage. Customers who have lost their income should call their utility today to receive a 20 to 35% discount on their bills through the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program and/or the Family Electric Rate Assistance (FERA) program: [www.cpuc.ca.gov](https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/consumer-support/financial-assistance-savings-and-discounts/family-electric-rate-assistance-program). The CPUC has a similar program for telecommunication customers, California LifeLine: [www.cpuc.ca.gov/lifeline](https://cpuc.us4.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5e3e2d344585d7235cd5b2ea0&id=e35abce84c&e=548a133dff). Additionally, CPUC has worked with utilities to provide the Climate Credit in April, which will help off-set higher bills.The Climate Credit is from a state program that requires electricity providers, natural gas providers, and other large industries that emit greenhouse gases to buy carbon pollution permits. The credit is the utilities' customer's share of the payments from the program. CPUC is working on additional actions to help reduce the impacts of increased residential demand on energy bills during the summer months including the possibility of additional bill credits and changes to the overall rate structures. Finally, there are also simple, no-cost energy behaviors that can help save Californians energy and money during this difficult time: - On cooler days, set thermostats to 68 or lower during the day/62 at night - Unplug unused devices and/or turn off power strips - Open blinds/curtains on sunny days to avoid using too many lights - Wait to use dishwasher when it's full Turn down screen brightness and use eco-mode features on work from home and entertainment devices. - San Fernando water comes from wells that pump water from in the ground.

Starting Thursday, December 10, Californians can opt-in to CA Notify to receive COVID-19 notifications informing them if they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for the virus. CA notify will alert users if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.

LA County's Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) is committed to working closely with county partners and allies in the child welfare community to ensure the safety of children during this pandemic and beyond. Moreover, the department and its community partners want to dispel misconceptions and make certain that Los Angeles County residents have the most current information. To address this and other concerns, DCFS has been actively engaged in a robust public information campaign. Most recently, the department issued a public service announcement that calls on residents to make an investment into the welfare of families in our communities by reporting neglect or abuse. For more information on this endeavor, please keep reading... In some communities, for example, residents mistakenly believe that if parents or guardians are COVID-positive DCFS will remove children from their care, which is incorrect. COVID status does not put your kids in peril. DCFS is only focused on reports of abuse and neglect. CHILD PROTECTION: OUR CALL FOR HELP The County of Los Angeles is asking county residents to be observant friends, neighbors or relatives - to ensure children in LA County remain in safe and healthy environments during the COVID-19 health crisis. With increasing pressures deriving from school closures, limited childcare options, rising unemployment rates and fewer social connections, LA County's most vulnerable families are feeling unprecedented stress. The Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) recently announced the Child Protection Hotline has seen a 50% decline in the number of calls received. Prior to COVID-19, it received approximately 1,000 reports on an average day. Without calls from observant teachers, childcare or medical providers, LA County social workers are unable to initiate contact and investigate suspected neglect or abuse. That is why we urge county residents to be attentive and watchful. If you suspect a child is being abused or neglected, please call LA County's Child Protection Hotline at 1-800-540-4000.

Educators are the primary source of reports (20 percent) to child protective services nationwide. However, teachers, guidance counselors, and day care providers who usually serve as lifelines for vulnerable children are no longer in a daily position to witness and report suspected abuse. There are ways everyone can do their part to protect children: COVID-19 MAPPING & DIGITAL DASHBOARDS - People who are concerned about a particular family can help by doing small things to ease the stress that comes with this time. Whether in the form of food, toilet paper, coloring books or just an empathetic ear, these acts of support while keeping social distancing can make a difference and ease parents' stress. - Make use of technology for virtual check-ins.

During this unprecedented time, families may experience higher levels of stress and uncertainty and the department is asking that community members be observant of children who may be experiencing neglect or abuse. DCFS Director Bobby D. Cagle said that with children out of the line of sight of mandated reporters, such as teachers and medical personnel, the concern for child safety has significantly increased. \"Social workers rely heavily on mandated reporters to initiate contact with our department in order for us to protect children,\" Director Cagle said. \"With this safeguard now gone, I am calling on Los Angeles County residents to be the voice for children who may be experiencing physical abuse, severe food insecurity or other forms of neglect.\" April marks National Child Abuse Prevention Month, an observance that strives to bring awareness of tools and resources available to families in need of support. The most common type of maltreatment is neglect. Federal statistics reveal that in 2019 an estimated 678,000 children were found to be victims of child abuse or neglect nationwide and, the year before, 4.3 million reports were made involving some 7.8 million children. For those who work with families at risk of becoming involved with the child welfare system, the goal is to help foster healthy relationships by imparting coping strategies to navigate difficult circumstances that can lead to neglect or abuse. This objective, dovetails with DCFS' prevention and aftercare services. During the 2019-2020 fiscal year, DCFS invested nearly $20 million in services including provision of basic goods, parenting education, financial literacy and peer support groups. These services are available regardless of age, immigration or insurance status, for as long as needed. Recognizing that family dynamics may be challenging even on the best of days, Director Cagle stressed the need for child abuse prevention awareness and community involvement now more than ever. \"This situation is sure to test the limits of even the most patient individuals,\" he said. \"But I want to emphasize that there are services available in the community to help. If you or someone you know is in need of extra support during this time of heightened uncertainty, please contact DCFS to find out what services are available in your area.\" To learn more about child abuse prevention month and how you can help, please visit: [childwelfare.gov/topics/preventing/preventionmonth/about/](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDIsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMDA0MDcuMTk4Mjg2OTEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGlsZHdlbGZhcmUuZ292L3RvcGljcy9wcmV2ZW50aW5nL3ByZXZlbnRpb25tb250aC9hYm91dC8_dXRtX2NvbnRlbnQ9JnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX25hbWU9JnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9Z292ZGVsaXZlcnkmdXRtX3Rlcm09In0.lojhHRGeTp7i5T4Ns8UwHrCsKuk6viaN3EH5sCKxGzo/br/77101522942-l).

The County wants the public to know that there are protections in place for renters who are at-risk of being evicted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The ban is in place through May 31, 2020. The order states: \"During this local emergency, and in the interest of protecting the public health and preventing transmission of COVID-19, it is essential to avoid unnecessary housing displacement, protect the County's affordable housing stock, and prevent housed individuals from falling into homelessness.\" The order protects people who have suffered \"financial impacts\" due to the coronavirus. This means a substantial loss of household income due to business closure, loss of compensable hours of work or wages, layoffs, extraordinary out-of-pocket medical expenses or child care needs arising from school closures. The protection extends to those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or who are caring for someone diagnosed with the virus. The order also protects individuals who have suffered financial impacts due to compliance with the County's recommendation to stay at home, self-quarantine or due to avoiding congregating with others during the state of emergency. Under the order, tenants must notify their landlord in writing within a week after their rent is due \u2014 unless there are extenuating circumstances \u2014 that they are unable to pay their rent because of the pandemic. The following are other important facts and protections in place: - The executive order ensures that all people in the County will continue to have access to running water during this public health crisis. This enables compliance with public health guidelines to wash hands often and have access to clean drinking water. - The order ensures that all customers in the County who receive power services from Southern California California Edison and Southern California Gas Company continue to have access to electricity so they may receive crucial COVID-19 information, keep critical medical equipment functioning and utilize power as needed. - Public utilities have announced that they will suspend service disconnections for nonpayment and waive late fees, effective immediately, for residential and business customers impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. - The moratorium applies to only unincorporated L.A. County. - Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, Burbank, Culver City, Glendale, Long Beach, Pasadena, Santa Monica, South Pasadena, and West Hollywood have issued similar orders.

Reports of malicious websites, email schemes, and suspicious links have come to the attention of law enforcement and public officials. \"Malicious actors can prey upon those that are distracted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and use it to their advantage,\" stated Los Angeles County Chief Information Officer William Kehoe. \"The public needs to be mindful and careful, and avoid websites, phishing emails, and scams that engage people through false information about the health crisis, and steal personal user information and data. By clicking on fraudulent weblinks, hackers can deliver malware and then gain access to passwords, browsing information, credit card numbers, and other personal information. We all need to stay vigilant.\" Currently, there are several Coronavirus tracking and mapping sites that are actually malware websites. Instead of clicking on these links, cybersecurity experts advise that website users should instead hover over the link to verify the uniform resource locator (URL) before moving forward. Online hackers may also send users emails from fraudulent accounts impersonating official websites and doctors, or offering medical supplies and services. A trusted COVID-19 mapping resource is the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Global Map, which can be found at [coronavirus.jhu.edu](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/). Additionally, there are several websites the County of Los Angeles recommends for accurate, up-to-date information on COVID-19.

Scammers are also taking advantage of this change in circumstances by reaching out door-to-door asking for donations and fundraising contributions through cash, Bitcoin, or Paypal. The County of Los Angeles reminds residents that they are not required to open their door, and encourages everyone to not feel intimidated by a false sense of urgency to answer door-to-door solicitations. The following is a list of safety tips the public can follow: - Avoid online advertising offers related to COVID-19 - Decline door-to-door solicitations claiming COVID-19 fundraising - Do not click on emails and attachments that you do not recognize - Visit trusted websites for COVID-19 related information Everyone should remain vigilant and take these steps to avoid being victimized by malicious scammers trying to profit from the COVID-19 crisis. If you believe you have been scammed, contact your bank immediately and report the information to local law enforcement. - All agencies listed serve clients in the Los Angeles County; the City of San Fernando is located in SPA 2.

Lastly, pregnant women should take the same preventative measures as the general public to avoid infection. You can help stop the spread of COVID-19 by taking these actions: - Stay home. Avoid contact with people who are sick. - Have food delivered to your home so you can avoid checkout lines at grocery stores. - Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, or using the restroom. Clean and disinfect your home to remove germs: practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces (for example: tables, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks & cell phones). - LA County's Department of Consumer and Business Affairs (DCBA) is taking steps to protect County residents from price gouging and potentially fraudulent COVID-19 remedies by creating a \"Stop Price Gouging\" mobile application to help consumers easily report suspected cases of illegal price increases in LA County. During the COVID-19 health emergency, fear and anxiety have led certain individuals to try and profiteer at the expense of those in need. To date, DCBA's investigations team has tracked and documented over 500 price gouging complaints during the COVID-19 crisis. While the mobile app will be launched in the coming days, DCBA already offers a dedicated webpage and phone line to help report price gouging or COVID-19 scams. To report by: - Phone: Call (800) 593-8222 - Online: Visit [stoppricegouging.dcba.lacounty.gov](https://lnks.gd/l/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDMsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMDA1MjAuMjE4MTkyMDEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3N0b3BwcmljZWdvdWdpbmcuZGNiYS5sYWNvdW50eS5nb3YvP3V0bV9jb250ZW50PSZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9uYW1lPSZ1dG1fc291cmNlPWdvdmRlbGl2ZXJ5JnV0bV90ZXJtPSMvaG9tZXBhZ2UifQ.ucb1qjykN-mKrOKV5ndOC8Xsnwd861WROZiRPKp95bs/br/78910688728-l) Once our \"Stop Price Gouging\" mobile up is available, it will help County residents file on-the-spot, accurate complaints that can be supported with: 1) photos of receipts, ads, and products, or 2) other possible evidence of wrongdoing. The new app is expected to increase rapid reporting of price gouging complaints, which is critical to ensuring that investigations are conducted close in time to the suspected price gouging activity.SUPPORT LOCAL SAN FERNANDO BUSINESSES The City of San Fernando is very supportive of small business and is promoting a #SupportLocalSanFernando program through the City's website and social media outlets. POSTERS AND SOCIAL DISTANCING FLOOR GRAPHICS The City printed posters for social distancing floor graphics to assist our local small businesses in informing and reassuring their customers about the steps they're taking to keep them (and their employees) safe during the COVID-19 health crisis. FACE COVERINGS: HOW TO WEAR THEM - Current Health Order Poster to let you know what they're doing to stop the spread of COVID-19. - Food To Go Poster to let you know what food options they're offering. - Social Distancing Floor Graphic to remind you to #StayHealthySanFernando and stay at least 6 ft apart. Have you wondered whether or not you've mastered the art of wearing a face covering correctly? Today, we highlight the very things your face covering should do when you're wearing it correctly. Before we *cover* these, please note: you always want to wash your hands before handling your face covering. Ok, here we go! You know you're wearing your face covering like a pro, if your mask: - Fits snugly but comfortably against the side of your face. - Is secured with ties or ear loops. - Includes multiple layers of fabric. - Allows for breathing without restriction. - Is able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape. - Covers mouth and nose with no gaps between your face and the mask. Also, while wearing your face covering be careful not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth when removing your face covering. And you should wash your hands immediately after removing it. TIPS FOR AVOIDING FOGGY GLASSES WHEN WEARING YOUR FACE COVERING - Wash your glasses with soapy water. Research has shown that washing glasses with soapy water, and letting them air dry before putting on your mask, reduces fogging. - Use tissue paper. Placing tissue paper between your glasses and the bridge of your nose may help absorb the moisture that causes foggy glasses.

FACE COVERINGS: WHEN AND WHERE TO WEAR THEM WHEN LA County's Health Officer Order does not require wearing face coverings while in the backyard or while on a solitary run or walk. County residents are required, however, to wear face coverings when in contact with other people who are not household members (whether you're in a public or private space). So, if you're on a solitary run or walk - and you see someone approaching - put on your face covering! WHERE LA County's Order is effective for all 10 million people who live in LA County. There is one circumstance, however, under which this may not be the case: when your local jurisdiction has a face covering order of their own. A few of you have asked, \"My city issued its own face covering order. Which order am I supposed to follow? The county's or my city's?\" Where local jurisdictions have implemented face covering orders of their own, the stricter order will apply. We urge you to contact your local jurisdiction by phone or online, to see if they've issued a face covering order of their own. If not, you'll certainly want to abide by LA County's Health Officer Order, in order to keep you and your loved ones safe.

Face coverings are not a substitute for our most powerful tools to slow the spread of COVID-19: staying home and practicing physical distancing - staying six feet away from all people - at all times. However, face coverings can: - help prevent you from infecting others; and - help save medical masks for healthcare workers or other essential workers that take care of people who are sick - or may be in contact with people who may be sick If you are already using cloth face coverings while out and about, thank you for taking this step to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Reports of malicious websites, email schemes, and suspicious links have come to the attention of law enforcement and public officials. \"Malicious actors can prey upon those that are distracted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and use it to their advantage,\" stated Los Angeles County Chief Information Officer William Kehoe. \"The public needs to be mindful and careful, and avoid websites, phishing emails, and scams that engage people through false information about the health crisis, and steal personal user information and data. By clicking on fraudulent weblinks, hackers can deliver malware and then gain access to passwords, browsing information, credit card numbers, and other personal information. We all need to stay vigilant.\" Currently, there are several Coronavirus tracking and mapping sites that are actually malware websites.

[Governor Newsom Announces Immediate Assistance for Businesses Impacted by COVID-19 Including Temporary Tax Relief and $500 Million in Grants](#1611620528371-f5501a74-c587)GOVERNOR NEWSOM ANNOUNCES IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE FOR BUSINESSES IMPACTED BY COVID-19 INCLUDING TEMPORARY TAX RELIEF AND $500 MILLION IN GRANTS Billions in immediate, temporary tax relief will support businesses impacted by COVID-19, including an automatic three-month extension for taxpayers filing less than $1 million in sales tax and interest-free payment agreements to larger companies with up to $5 million in sales tax and expanded interest-free payment options for larger businesses particularly affected by significant restrictions on operations based on COVID-19 transmissions. In partnership with the Legislature, California will provide $500 million in new COVID-19 Relief Grant funding for small businesses. Additional $12.5 million added to the [California Rebuilding Fund](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/11/20/governor-newsom-announces-launch-of-california-rebuilding-fund-to-help-states-smallest-businesses-protect-their-california-dream/)launched last week SACRAMENTO - As the federal government fails to provide additional financial stimulus support to main street businesses, Governor Gavin Newsom today announced that California will provide temporary tax relief for eligible businesses impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. The temporary tax relief entails an automatic three-month income tax extension for taxpayers filing less than $1 million in sales tax, extends the availability of existing interest and penalty-free payment agreements to companies with up to $5 million in taxable sales and provides expanded interest free payment options for larger businesses particularly affected by significant restrictions on operations based on COVID-19 transmissions. The total tax relief, if fully utilized, is estimated to have billions in impact. These efforts are informed by recommendations made by the Governor's Task Force on Business and Jobs Recovery. \"California's small businesses embody the best of the California Dream and we can't let this pandemic take that away,\" said Governor Newsom. \"We have to lead with health to reopen our economy safely and sustainably while doing all we can to keep our small businesses afloat. With this financial assistance and tax relief, California is stepping up where the federal government isn't. By providing potentially billions in immediate relief and support, our small businesses can weather the next month as we continue partnering with the Legislature to secure additional funding and investments in small businesses in the new year.\" Small businesses are drivers of economic growth - creating two-thirds of new jobs and employing nearly half of all private sector employees. California is home to 4.1 million small businesses, representing 99.8 percent of all businesses in the state and employing 7.2 million workers in California, or 48.5 percent of the state's total workforce. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a significant challenge to small businesses, employers and employees. An August [Small Business Majority](https://smallbusinessmajority.org/our-research/state-of-small-business-six-months-into-covid-19-pandemic)survey data found that 44% of small businesses are at risk of shutting down. Data released through the [Census Current Population](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/small-business-pulse-survey.html) [Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/experimental-data-products/small-business-pulse-survey.html)found that minority-owned businesses are disproportionately impacted: the number of active businesses owned by African-Americans dropped by 41%, Latinx by 32%, Asians by 25%, and immigrants by 36%. \"California's small businesses continue to struggle as a result of COVID-19, and this latest round of action at the state level will help bridge the financial gaps that are vexing our state's mom-and-pop business owners and nonprofits while we wait for congressional action, and as we prepare for additional legislative action at the start of the year,\" said Senate President pro Tempore Toni G. Atkins (D-San Diego). \"From widening access to grants, low-interest loans, and tax deferrals, to modifying fees incurred by restaurants and bars, these are critical supports for the small businesses and services that keep our communities going. Now, we need our federal partners to do their part and pass a federal stimulus so these businesses and nonprofits can survive 2020 and the year to come.\" \"While we wait for Congress and the White House to approve an economic relief package that responds to the current surge, California has a chance to help nonprofits, small businesses, and communities now,\" said Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood). \"I thank the Governor and the Senate for their partnership.\" Today's announcements build on the state's ongoing business support throughout the pandemic, including the Main Street Hiring Tax Credit, which authorizes $100 million in hiring tax credit for qualified small businesses. The credit is equal to $1,000 per qualified employee, up to $100,000 for each small business employer.

Through November 22nd, some 9,287 plans with almost $149 million in tax relief have taken advantage of this program. The Governor will direct the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration to do the following: - Provide an automatic three-month extension for taxpayers filing less than $1 million in sales tax on the return and extend the availability existing interest and penalty free payment agreements to companies (with up to $5 million in taxable sales) - Broaden opportunities for more businesses to enter into interest-free payment arrangements. - Expand interest-free payment options for larger businesses particularly affected by significant restrictions on operations based on COVID-19 transmissions. $500 Million for New COVID Relief Grant for Small Business The Governor announced the creation of a $500 million COVID Relief Grant administered by the California Office of the Small Business Advocate (CalOSBA) at the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development for small businesses that have been impacted by COVID and the health and safety restrictions. Funds would be awarded to selected intermediaries with established networks of Community Development Financial Institutions to distribute relief through grants of up to $25,000 to underserved micro and small businesses throughout the state by early 2021. Non-profits would also be eligible for these grants. CalOSBA is establishing the program and will make it available to small businesses as soon as possible - for updates on availability visit [here.](https://business.ca.gov/) Increase Funding for the California Rebuilding Fund by $12.5 million.

While there are a variety of Federal programs designed to address the crisis, they have critical limitations that still leave many Angelenos in need. Financial, technical, and cultural barriers have kept many of our neighborhood partners from accessing federal programs like the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL). The LA Regional COVID-19 Recovery fund seeks to address these issues by providing additional support to underserved communities throughout the county.
