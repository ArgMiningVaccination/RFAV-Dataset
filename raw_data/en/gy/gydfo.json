According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, \"Acupuncture is the practice of penetrating the skin with thin, solid, metallic needles which are then activated through gentle and specific movements of the practitioner's hands or with electrical stimulation. Acupuncture is part of the ancient practice of Traditional Chinese Medicine.\" Acupuncture is not a subset of chiropractic, and it is not a specialized technique. It is a separate and distinct healing system that fits very well with chiropractic care. The following certification programs prepare doctors practice acupuncture in conjunction with chiropractic practice. The instructors, in these programs, are Doctors of Chiropractic who hold Diplomate status in acupuncture. Each of them has vast experience in the use of acupuncture in their private practices and are experts in teaching this healing art. Acupuncture can take your practice to new levels.
