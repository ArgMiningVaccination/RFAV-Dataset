This goal is being accomplished by gaining better understanding of the biology underlying lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms and applying this knowledge to improve the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. Program Aims: - Discover the Genetic and Cellular Origins of Lymphomas and Leukemias - Develop Novel Methods of Diagnosis and Biomarker Monitoring of these Diseases - Develop New Therapies Program Directors Program Directory Treatment of GVHD in Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) Recipients Using AAT Plus Corticosteroids (CS) Compared With Corticosteroids Alone (BMT CTN 1705) Study CSL964_5001 will investigate the efficacy of AAT with corticosteroids compared with corticosteroids alone as first line therapy for patients with high-risk acute GVHD Stanford is currently accepting patients for this trial. Stanford Investigator(s): Intervention(s): - biological: Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) - drug: Placebo Eligibility Inclusion Criteria: - Patients 12 years of age or older - Initial presentation of acute GVHD after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for any indication - Any graft or donor source or conditioning intensity - Clinical diagnosis of acute GVHD requiring systemic therapy with corticosteroids Exclusion Criteria: - Prior exogenous AAT exposure for GVHD prophylaxis - Relapsed, progressing, or persistent malignancy - de novo chronic GVHD or overlap syndrome developing before or present at the time of enrollment - Receiving other drugs for the treatment of GVHD - Receiving systemic CS for any indication within 7 days before the onset of acute GVHD Ages Eligible for Study 12 Years - N/A Genders Eligible for Study All Now accepting new patients Contact Information Stanford University School of Medicine 300 Pasteur Drive Stanford, CA "}
