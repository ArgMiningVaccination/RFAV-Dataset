The policy also establishes a requirement for all employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 unless they have an approved exemption for medical or religious reasons. The requirement will be phased in for different groups, to allow for consultation and collaboration with the unions regarding the implementation details. In addition, as a condition of offer of employment, the University is requiring all new and prospective employees to provide proof of full COVID-19 vaccination prior to their start date. Those with valid medical reasons precluding vaccination, as well as those with established and sincerely held religious beliefs that preclude receipt of a vaccination, may request a waiver. Who Is Impacted? - New Hires: All new hires that have never worked for the University \u2014 faculty, staff, managers and temps \u2014 will be required to provide proof of full vaccination before starting. Student employees are subject to the student COVID-19 vaccination policy. - Current Employees: AFT Local 1904 has entered into an agreement with the University regarding implementation of the vaccination policy. Therefore, effective September 7, 2021, this mandate has been extended to all managers, temporary employees, and the faculty and staff members who are represented by AFT Local 1904. The procedural details and timelines are spelled out in the [policy document](https://www.montclair.edu/redhawk-restart/employee-covid-19-vax-check-and-vaccination-policy/).
