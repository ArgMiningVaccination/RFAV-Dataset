Abstract Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) covers a wide range of over 100 healing approaches, philosophies and therapeutic modalities that are no t provided by conventional medicine. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) covers a wide range of h ealing approaches not provided by conventional medi cine. Objectives: The study was aimed at identifying the prevalence , types and determinants of CAM use, so urces of information about CAM that patients usually depend upon and reasons of using CAM, Methods: : A cross-sectional survey was used to col lect data from random consecutive patients attendin g two PHC centres out of ten which was selected randomly in Abha city. All the patients more than 18 years a ttended to the clinic during two months (March & April) /20 14 was included in the study. Results: The present study included 504 patients attending the PHC centres. Th e mean age of the participants was 47.6 \u00b1 10.2 yea rs. 232(46.0%) were Males and 272(54.0%) were females. The majority of participants were Saudi ((88.7%)) and Muslims (96.4%). Most of the participants were Illi terate or school level (82.1%) and less than half o f them (42.9%) had enough family income > 10,000 SR. Abou t three fourths of the participants were born in ci ty, most of them were non smokers (81.9%) and about one thir d of them had self-perceived stress level more than 5. About one third (36.9%) of participants reported u sing CAM during the 12 months preceded the study. A bout half of the participants used CAM due to the person al and family beliefs and because of friends advice ( 63.4% & 46.8% ) respectively. More than half of CAM users used it regularly. 58.6% of CAM users Feeling phys ically & psychologically better after using it and most of them did not reported any side effects after using CAM. Conclusions: Use of CAM is prevalent among patients attending health clinics in Abha City. CAM is com monly used by all age groups. The significant factors fou nd to increase the likelihood of CAM use were Saudi nationality, Illiterate and the place of birth, the re were a statistical significant increase of usin g CAM among participants born in village. However, factors like age, gender, income, religion, smoking and perceiv ed stress level did not prove to be statistically significant and thus did not affect CAM prevalence significant ly. Most families has strong personal belief on CAM Because of the Belief that CAM builds up the body's own def enses and promotes self-healing and has less side effects . Key words : Prevalence, Determinants, Complementary, Alterna tive Medications, Clients 1. Introduction Alternative medicine is increasing interest and acc eptance among the general population. Although usag e is thought to be widespread among patients, little stu dies have been done. Complementary and alternative medications (CAMs) have been broadly defined by the World Health Organization to include a wide range of medications, beliefs, techniques and exercises that have the potential to improve general health stat us. This definition highlights the importance of CAMs as a m ulti treatment approach to prevent illness and main tain well- being, rather than to treat or cure illness (1). Co mplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is also defined as medical practices infrequently taught in medical sc hools nor widely available in hospitals, the latter being defined as \"allopathic medicine\" (2). According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternati ve Medicine (NCCAM), CAM can be described using broad categories: that is, natural products, mind body practices, manipulative and body-based practices, a nd other approaches (3). Alternative medicine is an y practice that is put forward as having the healing effects o f medicine but is not based on evidence gathered using the scientific method . It consists of a wide range of health care practices, products and therapies, (4) using alternative medical diagnoses and treatments which typically have not been inclu ded in the degree courses of established medical schools or used in conventional medicine . Examples of alternative medicine include homeopathy , naturopathy , chiropractic , and acupuncture . Complementary medicine is alternative medicine us ed together with conventional medical treatment in a belief , not proven by using scientific methods, that it \" complements\" the treatment. CAM is the abbreviation for Complementar y and alternative medicine. Integrative medicine (or integrative health) is the combination of the pract ices and methods of alternative medicine with conve ntional medicine (5). Journal of Education and 2222-1735 (Paper) ISSN 2222-288X (Online) Vol.6, No.18, 2015 52 Over time, CAM practices may become accepted and in tegrated into allopathic medicine. Complementary a nd Alternative Medicine (CAM) has been around for hund reds of years and includes different approaches and techniques for treating the whole person. It is mea nt to be used as well as and not instead of modern medicine (6). It is based on the belief that a alternative c are provider has to treat the whole person body, mi nd, and spirit (7, 8) .While Traditional medicine (TM) refers to t he knowledge, skills and practices based on the the ories, beliefs and experiences indigenous to different cul tures, used in the maintenance of health and in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness. It is \"a system in which medical d octors and other healthcare professionals (such as nurses, pha rmacists, and therapists) treat symptoms and diseas es using drugs, radiation, or surgery (9). The techniques us ed in alternative medicine are mostly less invasive than traditional medical practices meaning that they do not rely on surgery or conventional medications. Th e frequency of utilization of alternative medicine is increasing worldwide, and is well documented in bo th African and global populations to be between 20 - 80% (10,1 1). It has become more widely used, socially and po litically accepted all over the world (4Several reasons have been given by researchers for the increased prevale nce of alternative medicine utilization. These include fai lure of modern medicine to cure the underlying prob lems (12), and the perception that alternative medicines is ch eaper than conventional medicines (13).Some other a ttractions to alternative therapies may be related to the powe r of the underlying philosophies they share, which involve closeness to nature, spirituality, and the fact tha t these therapies often go along with the cultural beliefs of the people. People often turns to alternative medicine when they have a long-lasting problem that conventi onal medicine has not completely cured e.g. patients wit h chronic condition as joint pain, cancer, depressi on, gastrointestinal and liver disorders, skin problems and \"allergic\" or \"autoimmune diseases . Other peo ple may also use alternative medicine when they're not sick ; as they believe that alternative medicine techniq ues such as yoga can improve overall well being, and prevent il lness or to ensure a healthier lifestyle (14). The known determinants of alternative medicine use include socio-demographic and patient characteristi cs. Data on the influence of the sociodemographic factors on the use of alternative medicine are inconsistent a nd contradictory (15) .Many studies have found that ed ucation, income, and female gender are associated w ith increased alternative medicine use. It was reported that alternative medicine users tend to be women, middle- aged or have more education. Also, they were more l ikely to be in perceived poor health, and suffer fr om one or more chronic conditions, (16,17) especially mental, musculoskeletal and metabolic disorders. Understan ding the types of alternative medicine therapies most freque ntly used and the patient socio demographic factors associated with alternative medicine use can help h ealth care providers to address patients' needs mor e effectively, to achieve better adherence to treatme nt recommendations and to prevent harmful effects o f alternative medicine use over time. The objectives of the current study were to determine the prevalen ce, types and predictors of Complementary & alternative medic ine use among health clinic clients. 2- Study design and setting : A cross-sectional survey was used to collect data f rom random consecutive patients attending two PHC centres out of ten which was selected randomly in Abha city . All the patients more than 18 years attended to t he clinic during two months (March & April) /2014 were includ ed in the study. A full explanation of the study wa s provided with the questionnaires given to each part icipant prior to their recruitment, explaining the purpose of this study. Participants were assured that all of t heir personal information was confidential. The Sample size was determined by the formulae: n = z 2 x p x q d2 Where n: the minimum sample size, Z = constant (1.96) and p is the prevalence of CAM use assumed to be 0.55% on the basis of a previous study done in Riya dh, Saudi Arabia (18) and q = (1-p) = 0.45. Hence, the primary sample size was 381 subjects. The expected response rate is estimated to be 80%. Actual sampl e size = 381 x 100/80 =477. The sample size was increased to 504 during the fieldwork. The study protocol was approved by the ethical com mittee in the College of Medicine, King Khalid Univ ersity. Data were collected by face to face interview using a validated, constructed, anonymous, confidential questionnaire that include Socio-demographic includ ing age, gender, religion, , nationality, education al level, monthly income, etc. Types and reasons for use of complementary and alternative medicine is also inc luded in the questionnaire. Verbal consent was taken from th e participants who accepted to participate in the s tudy. Privacy was secured through enveloped questionnaire s and responses. Data were coded, validated, and analyzed using SPSS software package version 20. Both descriptive and analytic statistics were done. Univariate analysis methods were used at 5% level of significance. Bina ry logistic regression analysis was performed to identify poten tial risk factors for CAM use among participants i ncluding age, gender, nationality, religion, place of birth, and smoking. 3- Results: The present study included 504 patients attending t he PHC centres whom age was more than 18 years. Sociodemographic characteristics of the sample are summarized in Table 1 . The mean age of the participants Journal of Education and Practice www.iiste.org ISSN 2222-1735 (Paper) ISSN 2222-288X (Online) 47.6 \u00b1 10.2 years. 232(46.0%) were Males and 272(54.0%) were females. The majority of participan ts were Saudi ((88.7%)) and Muslims (96.4%). Most of t he participants were Illiterate or school level (82 .1%) and less than half of them (42.9%) had enough family i ncome > 10,000 SR. About three fourths of the parti cipants were born in city, most of them were non smokers (8 1.9%) and about one third of them had self-perceive d stress level more than 5. Table-I, also reveals that Saud i participants had a significantly higher prevalenc e of using CAM compared to Non Saudi ( p < 0.001). The prevalence of use was also increased among Illiterate or school level compared to University or higher level of edu cation (OR= 3.081 (2.004 4.739)). As regard to the place of birth, there were a statistical significant differe nce of using CAM among participants born in city or village (p= 0.037). On the other hand, there is no statistical significant difference between participants as re gard age, gender, religion, monthly income, smoking and self- perceived stress level and use of CAM. Figure 1 shows that diabetes mellitus was the most common comorbid condition among the participants (34.3%). This is followed by hypertension (21.6%), neurological diso rders (15.9%) and cardiovascular disorders (10.9%). As shown in figure 2, more than one third (36.9%) of participants reported using CAM during the 12 mo nths preceded the study.

As regard the reasons for CAM use, about two thirds (63.4%)use it as the y believed that CAM builds up the body's own defenses and promotes self-healing while about half of the m (52.2%) used it as it has less side effects. About half of the participants used CAM due to the person al and family beliefs and because of friends advice ( 63.4 % & 46.8% ) respectively. More than half of CAM use rs used it regularly. 58.6% of CAM users Feeling physically & psychologically better after using it and most o f them did not reported any side effects after using CAM.

On the other hand, the prevalence of CAM use was higher in other studies in Saudi Arabia in Riyadh 2008, and 2012 (21, 22), the prevalence was 73% and 85% r espectively and Al-Faris et al, 2008 in their hous ehold survey in Riyadh region, Saudi Arabia reported that 73% of the respondents used CAM before(23). as in these studies they include the prayer, spiritual and pr ophet medicine to the list of CAM, while in our stu dy we did not include it. In contrast, the prevalence in our stud y seems higher than what has been reported by some other regional studies. For example, a study on diabetic patients in Jordan found a prevalence of 31.0%. [24] Two different studies concerning CAM use by cancer pati ents in Jordan and Turkey found a prevalence of 32. 5% [25] and 31.1%, [26] respectively. Similarly, one study based in the Un ited States, which looked at a similar population of interest, found a prevalence of 39.0%, which is considerably lower than the prevalence that we have found(27). Furthermore, in Denmark, a prospective o bservational cohort study reported a 31% prevalence of CAM use (28). Possible reasons for the discrepancy in prevalence estimates reported could be the heter ogeneity of CAM practices, where there may be differences in what is defined as a CAM treatment and what types of CAM modalities are included in the studies. CAM see ms to have wide acceptance in the Saudi population. This might be related to the strong religious views that many of the patients base their CAM use on, and al so possibly the unawareness of the lack of scientific evidence and the potential for serious side effects and comp lications. The significant factors found to increase the likel ihood of CAM use were Saudi nationality, Illiterate and the place of birth, there were a statistical significan t increase of using CAM among participants born in village. However, factors like age, gender, income, religion , smoking and perceived stress level did not prove to be statistically significant and thus did not affect C AM prevalence significantly. These results of our s tudy were in agree with the results of A study carried out in Ri yadh 2015 (29) This is different from what has been reported in other studies. For example, Thomson et al. in a cro ss-sectional study showed that being female and bei ng younger is a predictor for CAM use [30) Comparing these factors to the US study, female gen der is the only common significant factor in increa sing the likelihood of CAM use. [27] In Turkish study shows that female sex, high income , and usage of multiple chemotherapy applications were determined as indep endent factors for CAM use (31). A study in Lebanon (32)showed that higher income was associated with l ower use of CAM therapies. In previous studies of determinants of CAM use, household income was consi stently positively correlated with CAM use [33,34,3 5]. This relationship between CAM use and a high income status in other studies could be attributed to the fact that couples of high income would be more likely to affo rd the cost of CAM[36]. Our study shows that the most frequent Type of CA M modalities used was Vitamins and minerals follow ed by Herbal therapies then Acupuncture & cupping , then Aromatherapy and finally Chiropractic therapy. In a study in Saudi Arabia 2015(37) reported that D ietary supplements, mainly vitamins and minerals, w ere commonly used by Saudis. Dorsch and Bell (2005) in their review on use of dietary supplements by adole scents Journal of Education and Practice www.iiste.org ISSN ISSN 2222-288X (Online) Vol.6, (12-19 years), where usage ranged from 10-74% (38). Jan et al. (2009) in Saudi Arabia(39) found that T he use of CAM by Saudi adolescents during their lifetime r anged from 1.6% for acupuncture to 58.6% for honey treatment. Spiritual therapy such as reading or hea ring the voice of the Quran is commonly used by Mus lim populations around the world for healing several ch ronic diseases and reducing stress. In many verses, the Quran focuses on the healing of disease (40).Personal and family members and friends were the main source of information on CAM for CAM users . This creates the need to educate the public, especially parents and peers, on the advantages and disadvantages of CAM. Media ( Internet, magazines, TV) was the second source of information on CAM followed by health practitioner and health food shop these results were in agreemen t with Abdulrahman (37)who reported that Family members an d friends were the main single source of CAM information and religious and herbal healers were t he most visited by adolescents. Our study revealed that that the most frequent reasons for CAM use were Belief t hat CAM builds up the body's own defenses and promo tes self-healing , had less side effects and Disappoint ment from conventional medicine . Abdulrahman et al (37) found that the most commonly cited reasons for use of dietary supplements by adolescents were: to main tain or improve health, to build muscle, to increase energy , to decrease or increase body weight. Faris et al , 2008(23) reported that The higher percentage of patientsagre ed that CAM helps conventional medicine; it treate d those diseases that were failed to be treated by conventi onal medicine and offer less waiting time and lower costs.. Lee et al, 2004 (41)found that patients may seek CAM tr eatment due to higher costs of conventional medicin e and long waiting time to meet doctors. In our study, mo st of the CAM users reported no side effects howeve r, Although CAM is perceived positively, several side- effects of this intervention have been reported, in cluding death, anaphylaxis, renal failure, and malignancy. Adverse effects occur directly or from drug interac tion (42). Our study showed that diabetes mellitus was the mo st common comorbid condition among the participants (34.3%). This is followed by hypertension (21.6%), neurological disorders (15.9%) and cardiovascular d isorders (10.9%). Faisal etal 2012 found that Abdominal pain (48.9%) and common cold (48.9%) were the most commonly reported diseases for which CAM was used, followed by evil eye (27.6%). The patients also us ed CAM for treating diabetes in (6.5%), depression (5 .01%) and tumours and malignancies 12 (3.0%) (43). CAM is used by the people in the management of chronic conditions that are costly to society, such as chro nic pain and arthritis, and more life - threatening diseases, su ch as heart diseases and cancer(44). A study in Sau di Arabia revealed that Saudi adolescents used CAM for healin g common health symptoms but not for chronic diseases(37). Information is the same for a house h old survey done in Riyadh by Al-Rowais et al, 2010. (45) Abdominal pain was followed by common cold; these a re common conditions that people seek medical care for. 5- Conclusions : Use of CAM is prevalent among patients attending health clinics in Abha City. CAM is commonly used by all age groups. The significant fa ctors found to increase the likelihood of CAM use w ere Saudi nationality, Illiterate and the place of birt h, there were a statistical significant increase o f using CAM among participants born in village. However, factor s like age, gender, income, religion, smoking and p erceived stress level did not prove to be statistically sign ificant and thus did not affect CAM prevalence sign ificantly. Most families has strong personal belief on CAM Bec ause of the Belief that CAM builds up the body's ow n defenses and promotes self-healing and has less sid e effects. References: 1.
