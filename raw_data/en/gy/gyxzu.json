Printed in Belgium PRINTED ON WHITE CHLORINE-FREE PAPER Foreword This is the fourth Annual report prepared under the auspices of COST820 and it serves to highlight some of our scientific activities and laboratory visits during the past 12 months. At one time I anticipated that this report would be the last annual description of our work but COST820 was granted an extra one year to contine with its work. Naturally the membership of COST820 are delighted that that our hard efforts have been recognised in Brussels. The COST820 action will now close in June 2000. Looking back over the life of COST820, I think that we are proof for the success of the COST scheme. Certainly our model has been looked at enviously by our colleagues in, for example, the USA and as I pointed out in an introduction to the 1998 Annual Workshop - At the end of September I participated in meeting in London that was organised by the UK Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food and which considered the value of COST actions in agriculture and biotechnology to the UK scene. My task of both defending and promoting our COST820 action was incredibly easy as I was able to illustrate my presentation with many references to the substantial networking that now exists across most of Europe (and not just those countries within the EU). As an example, I used the links involving the UK scientists that have been established because of COST but, equally, I could have shown the links emanating from other countries. Any one network that has arisen because of our participation in COST820 is proof that the concept works but within COST820 a substantial number of new links have been forged since 1994. In the context of the 1998 Annual meeting, I would like to thank Professor Luis Ortega-Mora and his colleagues for their efforts in making the local arrangements and, with Dr Astrid Tenter, for preparing the scientific programme and liasing with all delegates. Also, I would again like to thank all those members of COST820 who have contributed towards the preparation of this document (with their accounts of Working Groups, scientific activities, etc.), Professor M. Rommel for editorial help and senior colleagues within COST820 who promote and direct the activities of our action. Martin W.

SUMMARY OF OBJECTIVES OF THE COST820 ACTION COST820 Action began formally in July 1994 following the signing of a \"Memorandum of Understanding\" by at least seven countries. The main objectives are the: Evaluation of new vaccination strategies Development of new vaccines, with the emphasis on recombinant vaccines Study of innovative ways for vaccine production Preparation of recommendations for industrial production and efficacy and safety evaluations of vaccines Development of biomathematical models for evaluating the potential impact of immunisations on the epidemiology of infections with coccidia For these objectives, it was anticipated that high priorities will be given to three areas loosely defined as: Basic Studies: to include aspects of the molecular biology and immunology of the coccidial parasites that have potential relevance for vaccine development. Such studies might include the development of strategies to identify protective antigens, the isolation and characterisation of antigens and fundamental molecular analyses of the parasites, etc. Intermediate Studies: to include evaluations of eucaryotic expression systems to produce modified parasite proteins, investigations of the abilities of different viral and bacterial vectors to present antigens in different sites, examinations of different adjuvants and the initial small-scale evaluation of potential vaccine candidates. Vaccination: to include the more practical aspects of vaccinations and larger scale trials of any outstanding recombinant vaccine candidates will be required. 2. CURRENT STATUS OF COST820 The status of the action as at 1st January 1998, is that the following European countries are listed as participants in COST820. Austria*, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Ireland, The Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom. Note that Austria has observer status in the Management Committee. 3. LIST OF MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE Chairman/President/ Vorsitzender Dr. M. W.

WORKING GROUPS To facilitate the objectives of the Action, six Working Groups were established at the outset of the COST820 Action to provide a focus for specific areas of interest: WG1 biology 5. REPORTS OF THE WORKING GROUPS 5.1 WG1 and WG6 Avian coccidiosis and immunology and cell biology Co-ordinators: Drs Martin W. Shirley and Fiona M. Tomley A highly successful meeting, entitled \"Transfection and whole genome approaches to gene discovery and function: the way forward for vaccine research in coccidians?\" was held jointly between the two Working Groups at Grottaferrata, Rome, Italy on 19th -21st June, 1998. The scientific programme was organised by Drs Fiona M. Tomley and Martin W. Shirley with help from Dr Furio Spano. Dr Furio Spano and Dr Andrea Cri santi were the local hosts and provided an excellent venue The programme for the joint meeting and abstracts of the papers presented are included in the Appendix. A meeting of WG1 was also held on 27th February 1998 at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge on \"Identification of avian species of Eimeria, further experiments and the impact that the new work may have for vaccination strategies\". The primary purpose of the meeting was to discuss the work of Dr Beate Schnitzler (Sweden) who had recently developed a PCR diagnostic test based on the amplification of the ITS1 region of the genome. 5.2 WG2 Mammalian coccidiosis Co-ordinator: Janet Catchpole A well attended and successful meeting was held on 27th February 1998 at the veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge on the topic \"Coccidiosis in Pigs\". A copy of the proceedings is included in the Appendix 11 5.3 WG3 Cryptosporidiosis and cyclosporosis Co-ordinators: Dirk C. de Graaf & Background Organisms of the genus Cryptosporidium are Apicomplexan protozoans that infect several groups of vertebrates. Six Cryptosporidium species are currently considered valid: C. parvum and C. muris in mammals, C. meleagridis and C. baileyi in birds, C. serpentis in reptiles and C. nasorum in fish. Among these species, C. parvum, that is infective for mammals, has the most important economic impact. In calves and sheep C. parvum has been identified as the most common infectious agent in outbreaks of diarrhoea. Large numbers of cryptosporidial oocysts produced during commercial calf production contaminate drinking water resources and contribute to human cryptosporidiosis. Only ozone is effective in disinfecting drinking water from C. parvum. Few drugs are active against the parasite, and even less are commercially available. Moreover, public opinion is more and more opposed against systematic chemoprevention of parasitic diseases. Therefore, immuno-prophylactics should be considered. The prevention of cryptosporidiosis is difficult. Whereas most other species of coccidia are incapable of recycling within the host, C. parvum has two stages that initiate auto-infectivity : type I merozoites and sporozoites derived from thin-walled oocysts. These characteristics allow C. parvum to develop severe infections in hosts exposed to small numbers of thick- walled oocysts, and development of an effective immune response seems to be the only way to control infection. Little is known about the immunobiology C. panmm. In immunocompetent hosts cryptosporidiosis is self-limiting. Calves that recover from infection are resistant to a second challenge with the same strain. So recovery depends on a specific, acquired immune response, although the exact mechanisms responsible for resistance have not been defined yet. Colostrum plays a limited role. Although neonatal calves can be partially protected by hyperimmune colostrum, normal colostrum does not protect ruminants from infection. This may be due to the fact that the time of exposure of parasitic stages to colostral antibodies is too short to protect neonates. In humans passive lacteal immunity against C. parvum in breast\u00ad fed children has been described. No lactogenic immunity seems present in cattle, as most calves will experience cryptosporidiosis while they are nursing from immune cows. 12 The role of immunoglobulins in the elimination of the parasite is controversial. Some evidences support the involvement of antibodies in the clearance of the infection, such as i) the persistency of cryptosporidiosis in congenitally hypogammaglobulinemic individuals, ii) the good temporal association between C. parvum oocyst excretion and the amount of specific IgA in the faeces of calves and lambs and iii) the protective role of neutralising antibodies as demonstrated by their ability to inhibit invasion both in vivo and in vitro. On the other hand, there are observations arguing against the importance of the antibody response: i) oocyst shedding patterns do not differ between B-cell-depleted neonatal mice or bursectomised chickens and their controls, ii) challenged immune calves do not show a secondary mucosal antibody response and iii) AIDS patients with persistent cryptosporidiosis produce C parvum specific serum and/or mucosal IgG, IgM and IgA. Whitmire & Harp showed that peripheral lymphocytes recovered on the second day post\u00ad infection recognise antigens in a lysate of C. panmm oocysts. Natural Killer cells and tumour necrosis factor seem to have no influence on the progress of infection in BALB/c mice. This was confirmed by the fact that severe combined immunodeficient mice - who have natural killer cells but no and cells - develop a persistent infection and die within 12 weeks after infection. However, when their immune system is reconstituted by injection of spleen cells from normal donors they can reduce the infection level. This reconstitution seems to be CD4+ cell dependent, as was seen by depletion of different cell subsets of the samples to be transferred. Similarly, administration of neutralising anti- CD4+ cells and anti-INFy monoclonals prevented the recovery from infection after adoptive transfer with spleen cells. Interferon-gamma seems to be of major importance in the development of protection against C. parvum infection. Daily administration of INFy to immunosuppressed rats reduced the intensity of subsequent ileal infection. And administration of IL12 to immunocompetent and immunosuppressed mice reduced the severity of infection by a INFy dependent mechanism. Recently a specific INFy response was found after Cryptosporidium infection of neonatal calves. The antigens that provoke this cellular response might be interesting vaccine compounds. In chickens disease associated with C. baileyi manifests itself most often as a respiratory disease in immunosuppressed birds. Only occasionally the parasite causes intestinal or renal disease although combinations with tracheitis may be observed. Cyclospora may cause diarrhoea and weight loss in humans. The infection is felt to be a waterborne disease. The economic impact in animals is unknown. 13 Activities of WG 3 in 1998 A Working Group 3 Meeting was held on Saturday, 24th October 1998, during the Annual Workshop in Toledo, Spain. This meeting was entitled: \"A vaccine against cryptosporidiosis: reality or fantasy?\". The programme was as follows: D.C. de Graaf: General introduction. D.C. de Graaf: Is a vaccine necessary in veterinary medicine? A. Bonnin: Is a vaccine necessary in human medicine? S. Sagodira: The answers currently available. F. Petry: Mechanisms of the immune response to cryptosporidiosis relevant to vaccination. F. Spano: Possible targets offered by the molecular biology. A. Bonnin: Priorities for the future and conclusion. Based on this WG3 meeting a new list of points of action for the near future was derived: i) a clinico-epidemiological analysis to confirm the impact of cryptosporidiosis on the nutritional status and development of young children ii) a study of the consequences of combined antiviral chemotherapy on AIDS cryptosporidiosis iii) the study of the immune effector mechanisms involved in the clearance of the infection iv) the identification Cryptosporidium T-cell antigens v) the understanding of the mechanism involved in the passive immunisation of neonatal ruminants by colostral transfer vi) the identification and complete characterisation of new targets offered by the molecular biology vii) the confirmation of the protective potential of candidate vaccine antigens in vaccination trials viii) the study of the genetic structure of C parvum and the characterisation of the pathogenicity of different genotypes to ensure the choice of the most appropriate target. 14 Representation of WG 3 at the Annual Workshop: At the 1998 Annual Workshop of the COST 820 Action in Toledo, the following oral presentations were given by WG 3 members: S.

Coll., Digest Dis Res Ctr Start Building, Turner street, D. Buxton and Prof. M. Rommel 1998 has been a particularly productive year for COST 820 Working Group 4. Apart from numerous informal links between laboratories that it has created, more formal meetings funded by the EU have been very successful. 22 At the COST 820 meeting held to discuss \"Vaccines Against Animal Coccidioses\" in Toledo 22-25 October, members of Working Group 4 were seen to have been particularly active. Of 40 oral presentations 19 (47.5%) were by members of WG4. Under the umbrella title \"Recombinant antigens and other tools for the development of molecular- engineered vaccines against coccidial parasites\" six papers from WG4 demonstrated the very significant advances in our understanding of protective immunity to Toxoplasma gondii and three were presented on the very much more recently recognised Neospora caninum. Oral sessions. Within the first session, \"DNA Vaccines and Recombinant Antigens\", one was on vaccinating mice with recombinant proteins derived from Neospora caninum (presented by Simone Eperon, 1 below) and the other on the use of recombinant surface antigen,SAGl, to vaccinate mice against Toxoplasma gondii (presented by Henrik Vedel-Nielsen, 2 below). In the second session \"Identification of New Vaccine Candidates\" there was a further paper on the potential of SAG from T. gondii to induce protective immunity (presented by Furio Spano, 3 below) and two on specific surface antigens ofN. caninum (presented by Simone Sonda, 4, and Nicole Fuchs, 5). In the \"Transfection\" session the three papers concerned with T. gondii presented data on how the parasite could now be engineered to meet specific experimental needs which in turn could lead to the production of a successful vaccine (Adrian Hehl, 6). Jens Mattsson then spoke on the use of transfection to investigate and characterise the genetic background of certain phenotypes (7) and Martine Soete on the bradyzoite-specific surface antigen SAG4 in the temperature sensitive (Ts-4) vaccine strain (8). Bruno Gottstein then presented data from original research using knockout mice and wild-type mice as models for Neospora infection and showed the importance of both cellular and humoral immunity to this parasite (9). These sessions were then followed by a very focussed and relevant examination of the \"Epidemiology and Economic Impact of Coccidiosis In Animal Production\" starting with a scientific session followed by a round table discussion. 23 In the scientific session speakers examined the incidence of protozoan cysts in bovine, ovine and caprine abortions in Italy (Gabriella Di Francesco, 10). Five of the following six papers from members of WG4 then highlighted the very rapid progress being made in piecing together our understanding of bovine neosporosis. These covered its seroprevalence in England and Wales (Helen Davison, 11) and Spain (Enrique Tabares, 12) and then Jonathan Wastling emphasised the value of being able to accurately distinguish between different isolates of N. caninum by genetic typing to allow an accurate analysis of field data (13). As well as molecular techniques it is crucial that we have, and understand, what serology can do to help. In this respect Peter Lind moved the discussion significantly further forward in his paper (14) and then Jo Marks, summarising her studies into bovine immunity to N caninum, also demonstrated the importance of cell-mediated mechanisms and highlighted the role of interferon gamma (15). While these studies were in non-pregnant cattle the following paper by Catherine Guy examined immunological responses in pregnant cattle (16). The importance of cell-mediated immunity in protecting animals against the protozoa worked on by members of WG4 was further emphasised when the session ended with a paper on the role of immunological memory in Sarcocystis infection, by Thomas-Erich Jekel (17). In the round table that followed papers, by David Buxton, Jonathan Wastling and Astrid Tenter attempted to T. gondii, . caninum and Sarcocystis spp. respectively cost the EU in terms of inefficiency and lost production (18, 19, 20). The overarching conclusion from all three presentations was a) how important these parasites are in causing considerable losses in EU agriculture (as well as, in the case of T. gondii, causing human disease) and b) how these figures were essentially honest but crude estimates, as much work remains to be done in gathering more accurate data. Poster session. Eight of the 18 posters (44%) were presented by members of WG4. While one addressed the problem of toxoplasmosis in pigs (G. Jungersen et al, 21) the other 7 all presented research into neosporosis. Four tackled epidemiological aspects and incidence in cattle (A. Schock et al, 22; W. Wouda et al, 23; H.C. Slotved et al, 24; A. Uggia et al, 25) and one examined the potential role that foxes might play (S. Wright et al, 26). Two others looked at immunity to 24 Neospora in mice (A. Lunden et al, 27) and a comparison between bovine and canine Neospora isolates in a mouse model (R. Atkinson et al, 28). 46.5% of this very successful conference was devoted specifically to Working Group 4 with many of the other presentations also being of very great relevance to the group. A business meeting of COST 820, working group 4 was also held (at 21.00h on 22/9/98 at the Beatriz Hotel, Toledo Spain). The object of the meeting was to take advantage of having \"so many members of WG4 under the same roof at the same time\" to discuss the way forward. Those present were:\u00ad C. Bj\u00f6rkman (S). B. Gottstein (CH). J. Mattsson (S). Pereira Bueno (Es). A. Tenter (D). W. Wouda (N). D. Buxton (UK) \u00ad in chair, P. Savini F. J. Conraths (D). A Lund\u00e9n (S). L. M. Ortega Mora (Es). S. Stenlund (S). J. M. Wastling (UK). The meeting was convened to discuss two matters. 1. The proposal to run a joint meeting between COST 820 WG 4 (Sarcocystiosis, Toxoplasmosis and Neosporosis) and WG 5 (Epidemiology). 2. 2. Future funding for WG 4. 1. Neoporosis is now recognised as being of very great importance in European and World agriculture. Very recent data from members of WG 4 and scientists in other countries in the world variously indicate levels of calf abortion attributable to N. caninum being at 10 to 40% (with some estimates as high as 50%). The full life cycle of the parasite was shown to take place in the dog in the summer of 1998. In view of the importance of bovine neosporosis the meeting discussed the proposal that WG 4 hold a joint meeting with WG 5 and focus on epidemiological aspects of neosporosis in cattle. The recent 25 discovery that the dog is the definitive host for N caninum would make such a meeting very timely. All those present felt that it was vital that such a meeting should be held. It was unanimously agreed that we would ask Professor A. W. C. A. Cornelissen of Utrecht University (WG 5) and Dr W. Wouda (WG 4) to explore the possibility of holding such a meeting in Amsterdam either in January 1999 or around the end of April 1999. It was felt that the latter date was more realistic. 2. The meeting then discussed the possibility of seeking funding to permit the activities of WG 4 to continue after the demise of COST 820. It was agreed unanimously that in view of the important and very exciting progress in Neospora research that we would work to this end. It was also universally recognised that a very considerable amount of research into the parasite as well as pathogenesis and immunity in the host and epidemiology was required if the real losses caused by neosporosis were to be tackled in a meaningful way. It was felt that a provisional working title of \"The Economic Impact of Bovine Neosporosis\" could be adopted for the time being. COST 820 funded visits between WG4 laboratories. Dr Anja Heckeroth from the Institute for Parasitology, Hannover Veterinary School, Germany, visited the Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh, Scotland in the summer in an exchange which successfully transferred the technologies for the detection of Sarcocystis spp and Neospora by PCR between the two laboratories. In addition transfer serological methods for detecting infection by both parasites was also achieved. . 6 SHORT-TERM SCIENTIFIC MISSIONS 5 9 Hannover Germany Visit to Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, September 1998 In September 1998,1 spent 18 days at the Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh, United Kingdom. The aim of the STSM was to standardise methods for in vitro cultivation and Toxoplasma gondii, Sarcocystis tenella and Sarcocystis arieticanis between the two laboratories. 26 Firstly, I was introduced to cell culture techniques for N caninum and T. gondii. I learned different methods to test new cell culture reagents and to optimise the culture conditions. In addition, I learned a method for the isolation of N caninum from infected tissue and the start of a cell culture using this material. After I learned the routine maintenance of Vero cells and parasites I expanded one strain of each parasite, N caninum and T. gondii, and harvested the tachyzoites. Subsequently, the parasites were purified from Vero cells and other culture material. Most of the parasites were frozen and shipped to the Tier\u00e4rztliche Hochschule Hannover where two\u00addimensional electrophoretic analysis and comparison of protein profiles will now be carried out. A portion of the parasites were used to prepare antigen for serological tests, the enzyme\u00adlinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT). Secondly, I was trained in the methodology of an ELISA and IF AT for the diagnosis ofN. caninum in cattle sera. Evaluation of the tests with the newly prepared antigen was intensively discussed. In addition, sera from a German dairy herd were examined with both tests. The results of the two tests were compared with those obtained by a different ELISA which was carried out in Hannover earlier. Furthermore, I established an ELISA for the diagnosis of S. tenella and S. arieticanis infections in sheep and trained the staffai the Moredun Research Institute in the methodology of this test. The antigen, reference sera and conjugate for this ELISA originated from the Tier\u00e4rztliche Hochschule Hannover. Thirdly, different PCR methods developed at both laboratories for the diagnosis of different cyst\u00ad forming coccidia were compared. I introduced a Nested\u00adPCR for the species\u00adspecific diagnosis of S. tenella as well as S. arieticanis at the Moredun Research Institute. Primers for this tests were previously developed at the Tier\u00e4rztliche Hochschule Hannover. In return, I learned the Nested\u00ad PCR methods for the diagnosis N caninum or gondii currently carried out at the Moredun Research Institute. These methods will now be established as diagnostic tools at the Tier\u00e4rztliche Hochschule Hannover. In addition, blood samples from a German dairy herd and a German sheep herd as well as samples from tissue sections were examined by the PCRs. I wish to thank Dr. David Buxton and all the members of his group at the Moredun Research Institute for their kindness and helpfulness during my stay in Edinburgh. 27 6.2 Beate E. Schnitzler Department of Parasitology, National Veterinary Institute P.O. Box 7073, S-750 07, Uppsala Sweden Visit to Animal Health in Compton, Newbury, United Kingdom, November/December, 1998 From 16th November to 18th December 1998,1 spent several weeks working at the Institute for Animal Health in Compton, Newbury, UK. During this period I learned some basic as well as some more advanced techniques applicable to research on Poultry Eimeria. Am of this Short Term Scientific Mission was to plan several different experiments which are part of a big 3-year collaborative project between the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala, Sweden and the Institute for Animal Health in Compton, UK. These experiments had to be planed and divided between the two locations. Additionally I had the opportunity to learn and understand the basic techniques that should enable me to proceed with the part of the experiments taking place in Uppsala. Basic techniques I learned and commonly used, at the Institute for Animal Health include large scale preparations of faecal samples, flotations, harvesting and counting of oocysts, preparation for DNA extractions and different methods for DNA extractions (extractions from oocysts and from sporocysts), different techniques for inoculations of chickens (single sporocyst inoculation). Furthermore I was introduced to a new technique which implies the use of Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism markers (AFLP's). This is a popular new technique based on a molecular marker system and helpful for the construction of a genetic linkage map. I would like to thank Drs Fiona Tomley and Martin Shirley and all the members of the Parasitology Department at the Institute for Animal Health for their kindness and helpfulness during my stay in Compton. The introduction to the techniques will certainly help me not only with the experiments 28 planed in the near future which are based on a long cooperation between the two institutes but also contribute substantially to my general knowledge of Coccidiosis. Furthermore I would like to thank COST 820 for the financial support that made this short scientific visit possible. 6.3 Enrique Tabares Departamento de Patologia Animal I (Sanidad Animal) Facultad de Veterinaria Universidad Complutense de Madrid Visit to Animal Health in Compton, Newbury, United Kingdom, November/December, 1998 My visit to the Institute for Animal Health (IAH) took place from November 30th to December 18th 1998 (3 weeks). The aim of this visit was to construct a Cryptosporidium parvum cDNA library in order to identify parasite genes of interest. Contacts with Dr. Fiona Tomley and Dr. Martin W. Shirley at the IAH were established because of their expertise developing cDNA libraries for the close related protozoa Eimeria tenella. During this three weeks, two different cDNA libraries were developed. The first was from a cattle isolate (passage in sheep) from Spain (CUCM-1) and the second from a cattle isolate from U.S.A. (CUSA-1). C. parvum mRNA was extracted from 1010 sheep oocysts or 2xl09 cattle oocysts using the Fast Track 2.0 Kit (Invitrogen). For the development of the cDNA libraries the 1-ZAP cDNA Synthesis Kit (Stratagene) was used. Synthesis of the first and second cDNA strands was followed using label dNTPs. The cDNA obtained was fractionated in sepharose CL-2B columns and 1 and 3 high molecular weight fractions were recovered from the CUCM-1 and CUSA-1 isolates respectively. Approximately, 70 mg of each fraction were ligated into Uni-Zap XR vector and 1 ml of each ligation was packaged using the Gigapack III Gold Cloning Kit. Finally, phages were growth into XL1-BLUE cells. Titres of primary cDNA libraries were around 2x106 with a ratio of and recombinant and non recombinant colonies was greater than 100:1. The length of the inserted DNA fragments was determined in 9 random colonies for each library by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) using the T3 and T7 promoter sequences as primers and was found to be between 800 and 4,000 base pairs. Primary libraries were amplified and number of the titres were between 2xl09 and 1.6xl010 pfii/ml. 29 This is the first 1-ZAP C. parvum cDNA library developed in Europe and has been possible due to COST action 820. The expertise of Dr. Fiona Tomley was central to the successful end of the experiment and the work has opened the possibilities for future collaborations between our laboratories. 7. ACTIVITY REPORTS 7.1. DENMARK REPORTERS Peter Lind, Lene Jensen, Gregers Denmark Toxoplasma gondii A 5-year study on identification of genetic markers for T. gondii subpopulations and virulence properties were completed in earlyl999. More than 40 isolates, collected from swine, sheep, cats and foxes in DK after 1992 have been typed using monoclonal antibodies. A more discriminatory typing system, based on a repetitive non-coding element was recently developed by the project partner at the Statens Serum Institute, Copenhagen, and will be used to study a possible clustering of the Danish isolates according to host species of origin and already established virulence characteristics after inoculations to mice, young pigs and pregnant mini-gilts. Neospora caninum Studies on N caninum infection in cattle herds have been a major activity during the last couple of years in cooperation with Swedish colleagues in Uppsala and the Danish Agricultural Advisory Centre. Longitudinal blood samplings of cows from moderately to heavily infected herds over an 18 mo. period have shown a reasonable constancy in serological status (specific IgGl in ISCOM- ELISA) over the cows' gestation, with 90% maintaining either positive or negative status, 8% showing apparent seroconversion and 2.5% with fluctuating status. The IgGl/IgG2 ratio for Neospora-specific antibodies showed a drop at the time of calving/abortion, which may reflect changes in Thl/Th2 stimulation during gestation. A number of cows in two heavily infected dairy herds were subsequently sampled with monthly intervals during 1998 to study changes in IgG subclass profiles, phagocytosis and killing ability towards intracellular agents as well as cytokine 30 mRNA expression during gestation. The data is presently under analysis in order to find prognostic parameters for transplacental transmission of neosporosis in the individual cows. A swine antiserum with specificity for N caninum, obtained from experimentally infected gilts has been distributed as a positive control reagent to several partners within the COST 820 action. No indications of naturally prevailing infections with N caninum in European pig populations have so far been reported. Publications: Jensen, L., Jensen, T.K., Lind, P., Heegaard, P.M.H.

Genotyping Cryptosporidium isolates la. As part of a project aimed at understanding the population structure of C.parvum, we characterised a new polymorphic DNA region of the C.parvum genome, 8G26. This DNA region had been cloned following a previously described procedure (FEMS Microbiology Letters 1996, 137 : 207-211). Direct sequencing of PCR products obtained from the central region of this clone identified 6 polymorphic nucleotide positions that determined 2 distinct genotypes. This new typing system was applied to human, calf, and goat isolates of Cryptosporidium, and the distribution observed at the 8G26 locus was compared to the distribution of the same isolates obtained with the 5C12 PCR-RFLP assay we described previously (FEMS Microbiology Letters 1996, 137 : 207- 211) (manuscript in preparation) lb. We further characterised a bird isolate of'Cryptosporidium that had been identified as C. meleagridis on the basis of its host specificity and site of infection, but gave positive reactions with PCR reactions aimed at identifying C.parvum (Applied and Environmental Microbiology 1998, 64: 1454-1458; Parasitology Today 1999, 15: 80-81). 32 2. Interactions between C. parvum and the apical region of enterocytes In order to understand the molecular basis of the Cryptosporidium-enterocytc interaction, we analysed the organisation of cytoskeletal components of the microvilli during invasion and intracellular development of enterocytes by C. parvum. To do so, we used immunoelectron microscopy and antibodies to villin, ezrin and actin, 3 of the microvillus cytoskeleton components, to study the Localization of these molecules in C. parvum infected enterocytes. These experiments showed that the vacuolar wall surrounding C. parvum contains 2 microvillar derived components, villin and ezrin (manuscript in preparation). 1) Amplification of immune responses against recombinant proteins In order to provoke and improve a local immune response against Eimeria recombinant proteins, the effect of cholera toxin (CT) was investigated. CT alone was shown to be very immunogenic in chickens when given by the oral route and to evoke both a local and systemic antibody production. When a recombinant protein,lpel was mixed with CT and given, by this same route, an increase of the anti lpel IgA production was noted in the duodenum 3 weeks post immunisation together with an increase of specific IgG production both in duodenum and caecum. This effect was however too moderate to be used in further trials, perhaps due to the paucity of Peyer's patches in the chicken intestine. ISCOMs were then used with the same goal and since it was expressed, purified and renatured, Ea HSP 70 was the incorporated antigen. When tested by the oral route, these ISCOMs were unable to evoke an immune response either at the local level or in the serum although they were given several times to each birds. On the contrary, when given by parenteral routes, this ISCOMs formulation was very immunogenic both in antibody production and spleen cell priming, whereas HSP 70 alone in the same conditions did not induce these responses at all. 33 A protection trial was then performed with these immunised chickens and a slight protection was obtained both at the oocyst output level (38% for the first day of oocyst secretion ) and at the body weight loss level. However, when the total oocyst number were compared this significant decrease was no longer observed. We did no find explanation for this delaying effect on the life cycle and such an experiment must be reproduced before we can conclude The carrier effect of the HSP 70 from mycobacterium tuberculosis is well know and was studied with a peptide repeat from the circumsporozoite protein from Plasmodium falciparum and as fusion protein with protein from the HIV virus . We are then trying to express fusion proteins with the Ea HSP70 in order to study this carrier effect. Ea aspartyl protease or peptides thereof were then tentatively fused at the plasmid level. Until now we were unable to obtain expression of such constructs and we are study other constructs and other expression conditions. 2) Identification and characterisation of proteins from primary schizonts. this project continued through 1998 and certainly 1999 and after, being now our most important project. Several new genes were identified and their expression compared between sporozoites and primary schizonts. When isolated, the gene coding for such proteins are expressed, and antibodies obtained against the recombinant proteins. These antibodies will be used to localise the relevant antigens and to check an effect in inhibition of parasite development in in vitro culture of Eimeria tenella and finally to study and understand the cellular biology of the primary schizont. 3)Aspartyl-proteinase This project has continued in collaboration with Fiona Tomley in Compton were L. Jean is performing her PhD on this topics. In Jouy, because we were unable to activate bacterial recombinant Ea prepro aspartyl proteinase after renaturation, all the genes related to the proteinases were successfully transferred in the yeast Pichia pastoris and expression after methanol induction is now under study 34 7.3. GERMANY REPORTER: Professor H. Zahner Institute for Parasitology Justus Liebig University Giessen Changes of epithelial ion transport by intracellular coccidia stages (S. Kowalik et al.) Coccidia rely on their host cells for energy supply and nutrition and cause clinical signs as diarrhoea. Changes of ion transport systems in the host cells may be involved in these processes. An in vitro system was therefore established to study the effects of coccidian parasites on ion transport systems in epithelial tissues. It used HT29/B6, a human colon carcinoma cell line, which builds a polarised monolayer like an epithelium. Toxoplasma gondii served as a model parasite as tachyzoites invade HT29/B6 and replicate rapidly. Mature schizonts are formed within 20 h and merozoites are released after 24 - 30 h. Ion transport was measured in a special perfusion chamber (ussing system). Parameters determined were: short circuit current and conductance to record the electrogenic ion transport, chloride fluxes with (mucoserosal, seromucosal) and the paracellular water transport with 3H-mannitol. Measurement was performed 5 h, 10 h and 15 h post infection using monolayers in which approximately 30% of the cells were parasitised. The infection had rapid effects on the conductance of infected monolayers , which was two to three times higher than that of uninfected HT29/B6 monolayers throughout the observation period. Chloride fluxes of both directions were also increased two to three times when compared to uninfected cells, independent of the time after infection. However, the chloride netto fluxes and short circuit currents were unaffected by the parasites. Data on the paracellular water transport will show whether the increased chloride fluxes and conductances are due to a higher chloride transport through the cells or through paracellular pathways. Immunity in rats against Eimeria separata, a coccidial parasite of the large intestine (M. Q. Shi et al. ) The study aimed to characterise the local reactions in the caecum of naive rats and rats immune against E. separata to a primary and a challenge infection, respectively. Optimum immunity was induced by two infections with 5000 oocysts per animal each, given in a 10 days interval. The oocyst production of a challenge infection administered after further 10 days was almost completely abolished. Histopathological investigations performed up to 72 h after challenge showed, that predominantly the development of first generation schizonts were affected in immune rats. Challenged animals showed significantly increased infiltrations with lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, eosinophils and mast cells when compared with rats after primary infection. Immunohistological studies compared local tissue infiltrations in naive and immune rats over a period of 48 h after primary infection and challenge, respectively. There was no difference between the groups concerning CD45R+ cells, whereas significantly more CD3+ cells were found in the caecum wall of the immune rats. CD4+cells predominated in animals after primary infection, whereas CD8+ cells represented the predominant cell subset in challenged rats. The proportion of + cells did not differ between the groups, whereas challenged rats showed significantly increased numbers of + cells in the caecum wall, when compared with animals after a primary 35 infection. These findings suggest that predominantly CD4^ cells may be involved in the immune response after primary infection, and that immunity to a challenge infection may be mediated by CD3+, CD8+ and + cells. Development of effective in vitro methods for excystation of sporozoites (S. Kowalik et al.) In vitro studies with coccidia are sometimes hampered by a lack of suitable protocols for the isolation of viable sporozoites. Thus, in case of Eimeria separata, a parasite of the large intestine of rats, none of the techniques described for other coccidia was found sufficient. Therefore a method was developed particularly suitable for this parasite. The procedure uses conditions which resemble the in vivo environment. A first treatment of the oocysts in a 0.4 % pepsin/HCl solution alters the oocyst wall, which becomes thinner. The second treatment in a 0.4 % trypsin/0.75 % taurocholate medium breaks the oocyst wall and sporocysts release. A third incubation of the oocyst-sporocyst mixture in a trypsin-free medium with 0.75 % taurocholate and an additive of MgCli followed by a final incubation in medium RPMI with 1 % foetal calf serum yields an excystation of sporozoites Heise are well known in parasitic helminths and seem to be involved in immunoregulative processes. In parasitic protozoa there is no information on this posttranslational modification. Studies with TEP15, a myeloma protein which specifically recognises PC showed 3 reactive molecules of 66, 70 and 75 kDa in E. bovis merozoites I. PC epitopes are localised on the surface of merozoites and sporozoites in relative large amounts and can be removed by treatment with methanol or phospholipase C. Together with other data the results suggest that PC is linked to glycosphingolipids as they were described in Ascaris spp. Methanol treatment disclosed additional TEPC15-reactive material in an apical subpellicular, cap-like structure. Current experiment attempt to isolate PC-bearing molecules for f\u00fcrther detailed characterisation.

ITALY REPORTER: Dr. Furio A. Moro, 5, Box 6 Roma 62, Italy Participants the Piazzale A. Moro, 5, Box 6 Roma 62, 00185 Rome, Italy. Andrea Crisanti Department of Biology, Alexander Fleming Building, Imperiai College, Imperiai College Road, London SW7 9AX, U.K. Progress report: a) Cloning of Cryptosporidium parvum proteins with adhesive properties. In our search for Cryptosporidium proteins potentially involved in the invasion process we have 37 recently cloned a C. parvum cDNA encoding a polypeptide, named sporozoite cysteine-rich protein (SCRP), possessing the following structural features: i) a leader peptide, ii) three thrombospondin- like repeats, iii) one EGF-like domain and iv) a transmembrane sequence. SCRP is the second thrombospondin-related protein identified in C. parvum that adds 92: 147-162, 1998), a micronemal protein recently cloned in our laboratory sharing structural similarity with EtplOO of.E. tenella and MIC2 of T. gondii. The SCRP gene is highly expressed in C. parvum sporozoites, where the protein seems to accumulate in the apical portion of the parasite. Work is in progress to establish the exact sub-cellular location of SCRP and assess its possible involvement in sporozoite gliding motility and/or host cell invasion. b) Analysis of genetic variation in Cryptosporidium parvum. Our interest in C. parvum has recently extended to the study of the parasite genetic variation. Most of the C. parvum typing studies carried out to date are based on the analysis of single polymorphisms. A multilocus approach has the potential to better define the structure of the C. parvum population and assess the degree of genetic isolation of the H (genotype 1) and C (genotype 2) subpopulations. With this in mind we genotyped 28 C. parvum isolates of various host and geographical origin by simultaneously analysing up to five polymorphic loci belonging to at least three distinct linkage groups. Isolates were from Europe, North and South America and Australia. Seventeen isolates originated directly from humans, 3 were derived from humans and propagated in calves, and 8 were from various animals. Human isolates were both from sporadic cases and from documented outbreaks. Two isolates were derived from AIDS patients. Animal samples included the widely used Moredun and GCH1 isolates. The five polymorphic loci selected for this study have been shown to consist of at least two alleles differentially associated with animal or human C. parvum isolates. Four of the genetic markers were analysed by polymerase chain reaction- restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assays and corresponded to protein- encoding residing within the internal transcribed spacer region 1 (ITS1) of the Type A ribosomal unit, was analysed 712-716, 1996). Consistent with previous studies, isolates segregated into two groups, one comprising both human and animal isolates, the other only isolates 38 of human origin. No recombinant genotype was detected. This evidence, together with the broad geographical distribution of the multilocus genotypes identified, brings further support to the hypothesis that C. parvum reproduction is substantially clonal. c) Molecular characterization of novel S AGI-related Toxoplasma gondii antigens. The invasive stages of the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii are known to express a set of surface antigens, known as the SAG proteins, sharing structural and functional characteristics. These molecules, which are anchored to the plasmamembrane via a GPI motif, are differentially expressed in sporozoites, tachyzoites and bradyzoites and are believed to play a role in the early steps of host cell invasion. The most extensively characterised among the SAG proteins are SAG1 (p30), which is expressed exclusively in the tachyzoites and represents the immunodominant antigen during T. gondii infection (Burg et al., J. Immunol. 141: 3584-3591, 1988) and SAG3 (p43), which is present in all invasive stages (Cesbron-Delauw et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269: 16217- 16222, 1994). These two molecules share approximately 40% amino acid identity and the presence of two amino acid repeats each containing 6 cysteine residues at conserved positions. T. gondii lines defective for either SAG1 or SAG3 have been shown to possess a reduced invasive activity. Recently, a series of novel T. gondii proteins sharing close structural similarity with S AGI and SAG3 have been identified: SRS1-4 and BSR4 89: 271-282, 1997) and SAG5 in our laboratory. A portion of the SAG5 gene was accidentally amplified from the genomic DNA of T. gondii (RH strain) employing unrelated primers. The PCR product 12G/16, encoding a 212 amino acid-long polypeptide showing a significant homology to both S AGI and SAG3, was used as a probe to screen a genomic T. gondii cosmid library. Southern blot analysis of the positive cosmid clones and of T. gondii genomic DNA employing the 12G/16 fragment as a probe yielded complex hybridisation patterns, suggesting the existence, in the genome of T. gondii, of a family of related genes. Extensive sequence analysis confirmed this hypothesis and revealed the presence of three tightly clustered genes encoding closely related proteins, denominated SAG5.1, SAG5.2 and SAG5.3. Al three polypeptides show the hallmarks of the family of S AGI-related molecules, being characterised by a leader peptide, 12 cysteine residues whose distribution suggests a tandem duplication of an ancestral 6-cysteine motif and a C-terminal GPI-anchoring signal. SAG5.2 and SAG5.3 are 367 amino acid-long and differ from each other at 8 amino acid positions (98% identity), while SAG5.1, which consists of 362 amino acids, is virtually identical to the other two SAG5 proteins only within the C-terminal region (positions 162-362). Notably, in the N-terminal 39 half of the molecule the degree of amino acid identity to SAG5.2/SAG5.3 drops to approximately 40%, which represents the average homology shared by all members of the \"SAG1\" protein family. Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis of poly(A)+ RNA showed that all three SAG5 genes are expressed in tachyzoites. The transcriptional activity in the other invasive stages is under study. The Localization of the SAG5 proteins in T. gondii tachyzoites was investigated by immunofluorescence and immunoblot employing polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant histidine-tagged fragments of SAG5.3 and SAG5.1 produced in E. coli and affinity purified by nickel chelate chromatography. SAG5.2 and SAG5.3 appear to be exposed on the parasite plasmamembrane, while the localisation of SAG5.1 will require f\u00fcrther investigation.

Thus, in combination with our previous work (5), a complete set of ITS 1 based, species\u00adspecific primers for the detection and discrimination of all seven Eimeria species that infect the domestic fowl is now available. ITS1 primers for each of these seven species of Eimeria were further tested and evaluated in field samples. Additionally, they could be used as capture probes in a colormetric paper chromatography assay (PACHA). The addition of PACHA to the PCR assay provided a faster, more simplified alternative to the visualisation of PCR fragments by ethidium bromide staining and can be a useful approach in epidemiological studies (6\u00ad12). Alternatives to coccidiostats Non\u00adchemotherapeutic means to control coccidiosis in broiler chickens have been studied in a series of experiments (13\u00ad14). In Sweden antimicrobial and growth promoting feed additives are not routinely used. Since some anticoccidials have antibacterial as well as anticoccidial effects, we have also studied how such substances affect the bacterial flora of the gut (2\u00ad3). Publications 1.

It has been used for serological studies ofN. caninum infections in dogs, cattle and water buffaloes. In a study comprising 80 dogs from the Czech and Slovak Republics, the sera were analysed for antibodies to N. caninum by the iscom ELISA and the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). One (1.3%) of the sera tested positive in both assays. Retrospective studies of the records of this dog revealed that it had shown clinical symptoms suggestive of N caninum-infec\u00faon (7). Serum samples from 200 dairy cattle and 200 beef water buffaloes were collected in southern Vietnam during May to September 1995. The sera were analysed for antibodies to N. caninum by the iscom ELISA and IF AT and for antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii by the direct agglutination test. Significant levels of N. caninum antibodies were detected in 5.5% of the cattle sera and in 1.5% of the water buffalo sera. 10.5% of the cattle sera and 3% of the water buffalo sera were found to contain T. gondii antibodies. Two of the cattle sera had both T. gondii and TV. caninum antibodies. The present communication is the first to report serological evidence of N. caninum infection in the water buffalo (5). In collaboration with scientists from Hungary, 97 sera from dairy cows that had aborted were analysed for antibodies to N caninum and other infectious agents known to cause bovine abortion. Antibodies to N caninum were found in 10% of the cows indicating that this parasite might be a cause of abortion in Hungarian cows (4). As part of a study comprising 1439 Norwegian dairy goats in 22 herds experiencing abortion problems, sera from 80 goats which had lost their foetuses and 25 goats with normal pregnancies were analysed for antibodies to N. caninum. Twenty three foetal brains were examined histologically and immunohistochemically for Af. caninum. No evidence ofN. caninum infection was found by any of the methods (3). 44 Oral M caninum infection in neonatal calves Out of 4 calves dosed orally soon after birth withN. caninum tachyzoites mixed with colostrum, 2 became infected as shown by serological reactions and demonstration of N caninum in their brains by PCR (12-14). The data suggest that oral infection ofN. caninum via colostrum is a possible route of vertical transmission in newborn calves, in addition to transplacental infection. Experimental N caninum infection in pigs At the Danish Veterinary Laboratory, experimental infection of 6 pregnant gilts with the bovine N. caninum isolate Nc-SweBl was performed (6). Al gilts showed evidence of generalized infection, and, in one of them, transplacental transmission of the parasite to three foetuses was demonstrated. The study showed that N caninum readily establishes in the pig and has the potential to be transmitted transplacentally to the offspring of infected sows. Immunisation of mice against neosporosis The possibility of inducing protection against N caninum infection by immunisation, was investigated using a BALB/c mouse model. It was found that immunisation of mice with live parasites or parasite antigens either mixed with the saponin Quii A or incorporated into iscoms resulted in at least partial immunity against experimental neosporosis. In contrast, immunisation with parasite antigen without any adjuvant appeared to increase the susceptibility to infection (8-9). Sarcocystis species in water buffaloes in Vietnam Studies on Sarcocystis species of the water buffalo in Vietnam have been continuosly performed by a veterinary PhD student at at SWEPAR. Previously, three species of the water buffalo have been recognised, namely S. fusiformis, S. buffalonis and S. levinei.. During 1998, a paper describing a fourth bubaline species, S. dubeyi, was accepted for publication in the Journal of Parasitology, due out in January 1999. Recognition of a Sarcocystis species in otter (Lutra Intra) A paper describing the finding of large numbers of sarcocysts in the skeletal muscles of an otter in Sweden constitutes the first report of Sarcocystis infection in this species (15). The sarcocysts were 0.3 - 2.3 mm long and 0.06 - 0.25 mm wide, and ultrastructurally they had a serrated surface without any visible projections. The otter, although mainly a predatory animal, may serve as 45 intermediate host for a Sarcocystis species that completes its life\u00adcycle in a not yet identified carnivore, or it may in this case have acted as accidental host due to possible immunosuppression.

Immunology and cell biology \u00ad Working Group 6 Molecular biology of T. gondii We have previously used an RNA display technique to identify genes that are down\u00adregulated in an avirulent T.gondii mutant. One of these genes have now been characterised in detail. The gene encodes for a 36.2 kDa large surface protein that is expressed in tachyzoites (1). Sequence analysis suggests that this protein most likely carries a signal peptide that is of importance for its targetting to the surface, and Western blot data suggest that this signal peptide is cleaved off during maturation. Preliminary experiments with antibodies raised against a recombinant form of the protein localise the native protein to the apical end of the parasite. Studies are now underway to determine its importance for virulence. In collaboration with Dr. J. Wastling, University of Glasgow, UK, a number of T. gondii mutants overexpressing a cell\u00adcycle dependent kinase have been constructed (2). On a short term scientific mission within the COST 820 framework, during the summer of 1998, Dr. Wastling visited SWEPAR where he studied the integration of novel genes into the genome of T. gondii. 47 Publications 1.

Fuchs, B. of Berne) Research on Neospora caninum and neosporosis: 1998 Part 1. Identification and characterisation cell surface-associated- and intracellular antigens in a polyclonal anti-N. caninum antiserum: The approach used in our laboratory to identify possible parasite molecules involved in host cell entry was based on the rationale that these molecules must, at some stage, interact with membrane components. Thus, to identify membrane-interacting proteins ofN. caninum tachyzoites, purified tachyzoites were fractionated using the non-ionic detergent Triton-X-114. We were successful in the identification, characterisation and purification of three antigenically reactive bands of approximately 43, 36 and 33 kDa, as described earlier. Nc-P36 exhibits a striking amino acid sequence similarity (76.3% similarity with 51.3% identities) to P30 (SAG1) the major T. gondii tachyzoite surface protein 1 which has previously been shown to serve as attachment factor. The deduced amino acid sequence ofNc-P43 was also determined (Genbank accession No. U93870). Comparison of theNc-P43 sequence with Toxoplasma surface antigens shows a high degree of similarity to the members of the family of S AGI-related antigens, with the highest similarity (44% identical amino acids) to the SAGl-related sequence 2 (SRS2) protein (GenBank accession No. AF012276). The degree of conservation is less than for the SAG1/Nc-P36 pair, but more careful analysis unambiguously shows the preservation of an overall architecture which is a hallmark for the members of this family 48 of GPI\u00adanchored surface antigens. Al 12 cysteine residues in the mature proteins after cleavage of the putative N\u00adterminal signal sequence can be aligned without introduction of significant gaps. Further biochemical evidence with regard to GPI\u00adanchoring of Nc\u00adP43 and Nc\u00adP36 was provided in a collaboration with PD Dr. Peter B\u00fcttikofer's group at the Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of the Medical Faculty at the University of Bern by performing in vivo metabolic labelling ofN caninum tachyzoites using uniquely into GPI\u00adanchors) and subsequent immunoprecipitation of respective proteins using specific antibodies. Part 2. Murine model for/V. caninum infections, immunology and the role of NO. A mouse model for N caninum infections was established in our laboratory. It is comprised of B\u00ad cell\u00addeficient antibody knock\u00adout mice (C57BL/6 mice with a transgenic mutation in the transmembrane exon of the IgM chain gene; mice) and the corresponding parental strain C57BL/6. Wild type (wt) mice exhibited no symptoms upon an infective dose of 105 parasites / mouse, while the mice succumbed to lethal infection within 29\u00ad31 days p.i. PCR\u00adanalyses showed that more organs with a significantly higher infection and multifocal necrotic lesion intensity were parasitised in mice than in wt mice. In both wt and mice infected with live parasites, spleen cells stimulated with Nc\u00adantigen produced high levels of IFN\u00ad and EL\u00ad10 in comparison to mice immunised with dead parasites. spleen cells produced less EL\u00ad10 than wt splenocytes, the phenomenon became more evident with increasing time of infection. No EL\u00ad4 production was detected in either mouse strain. Infected mice produced higher amounts of EL\u00ad2 than control mice inoculated with dead parasites, but no significant differences were seen between wt and mice. Splenocyte proliferation was actively suppressed by live N. caninum infection. Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was monitored on brain sections using an anti\u00ad murine iNOS antibody detected by the peroxidase method. The sections were subsequently immunolabelled with an anti\u00adAA. caninum antibody detected by the alkaline phosphatase method. In wt mice, parasite tachyzoites were found only at extremely low numbers in the brain and no iNOS could be detected in any brain cell. Conversely, in the brain of mice, multifocal lesions were seen: numerous parasites, often clustered, were present around a central necrotic lesion. In this heavily infected region and in the more peripheral region as well, numerous macrophage\u00adlike cells were iNOS\u00adpositive. Spleen cells obtained from mice infected for 10 and 24 days were in vitro cultivated during 72 h in presence of either crude extract antigen from N. caninum or from 49 Toxoplasma gondii or LPS. Cells from mice infected for 10 days produced nitric oxide (NO), whereas those from infected wt mice did not produce any NO. These results suggest that caninum increases both expression of iNOS and production of NO in cells of brain and spleen. The lethal outcome ofN. caninum-m\u00cdQC\u00faon in B\u00adcell deficient mice may be partially explained by an overproduction of NO. Part 3. Vaccination studies Two types of vaccination studies are currently being carried out, using the murine model established in our lab. In collaboration with Camilla Bj\u00f6rkman's group in Uppsala, passive immunisation with anti\u00adiVeaspor\u00f8\u00adISCOMs mAbs in antibody knock\u00adout mice is investigated, while active immunisation trials with recombinant Nc\u00adP43 and Nc\u00adP36 are performed using the parental C57BL/6 mouse strain. Planning of a third vaccination trial employing DNA vaccination of C57BL/10 mice (with cDNA corresponding to Nc\u00adP43 and Nc\u00adP36) is in progress. Part 4. Bovine neosporosis and epidemiology Neospora caninum has been recognised as one of the major protozoal abortion\u00adinducing parasites in Swiss cattle. Diagnostic tools were initially validated upon experimental infection protocols. PCR was positive predominantly for the foetal brain and, additionally, for the abomasal and amniotic fluid of foetuses derived from experimentally infected heifers. The heifers seroconverted between day 10 to 17 p.i., foetuses remained serologically negative in all cases. By using these validated diagnostic methods, we have recently determined first prevalence data for the live\u00adstock production in Switzerland. Thus, Neospora-DNA was detected by PCR in 24 brains (29%) from 83 bovine abortions, many of these brains were simultaneously characterised by histopathological findings typical for a protozoal, cerebral parasitosis. In another study we obtained first data on the Neospora- and 7bxop/asma\u00adseroprevalence in Swiss cattle. We tested 1,689 sera obtained from 113 dairy farms: The seroprevalence was 11.5% forAfeospora\u00adSA\u00adELISA and 10.7% for 7bxop/as/wa\u00adP30\u00adELISA. From the same samples, 1.1%, less than statistically expected, were positive in both ELISAs. Within selected groups of beef cow\u00adcalf farms, the seroprevalence using the Neospora-SA-ELISA was 14% for dams and 15% for offspring calves. Seroprevalences determined by 7bxop/a5wa\u00adP30\u00adELISA were 8% for dams and 3% for calves, respectively. None of the sera were double\u00adpositive by both ELISAs. In order to investigate the epidemiological situation in Switzerland further, a case\u00adcontrol\u00adstudy covering six regions of Switzerland is presently performed. 50 7.7. UK REPORTER:Dr D.

Volume IV 335\u00ad336 REPORTER: Dr J M Wastling In August 1998 a Short Term Scientific Mission funded under the COST 820 programme enabled Dr Jonathan Wastling of the University of Glasgow, United Kingdom, to spend a week at the laboratory of Dr Jens Mattsson of the Swedish National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden. This collaboration arose directly as a result of the COST820 programme. The objectives of this visit were: 1. To strengthen the collaborative link between the University of Glasgow, United Kingdom, and the Swedish National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden, particularly in the area of research into cyclin\u00addependent kinases of Toxoplasma gondii. 2. To enable the application of the technique of stable transformation of T.gondii to investigate the functional role of Toxoplasma CDKs. 3. To investigate collaborative projects and funding opportunities that might arise from the collaboration between Glasgow University and the Swedish National Veterinary Institute. 52 4. For Dr Wastling to meet other members of the Swedish National Veterinary Institute as well as other academic members of Uppsala University. 5. For Dr Wastling to present a seminar to the Swedish National Veterinary Institute on current research in Glasgow with the objective of highlighting areas of mutual interest between the two institutions, especially those topics relevant to the COST820 programme. The funds provided by the European Commission under the Short Term Scientific Mission enabled the above objectives to be fulfilled. A strong link encompassing a number of scientific projects has now been established between the two institutions. Future studies on the use of yeast\u00adtwo hybrid technology for detecting molecules that interact with T.gondii cyclin\u00addependent kinases and on reverse genetic technologies for determining gene function were planned during the visit. This work is currently in progress in the respective laboratories. Attendance at two subsequent WG meetings in Rome and Toledo was also made possible by funding under the COST820 programme. These subsequent meetings were valuable in sustaining the outcomes of the Short Term Scientific Mission.

Daniel Lawson The Sanger Centre, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, Cambridge CBIO ISA The past decade has seen the movement of sequencing technology from the laboratory bench to the factory floor. The majority of large scale (Mb's) sequencing is undertaken at a handful of genome centres specifically founded for this purpose. The scale of these centres has meant a reduction in the cost of sequencing, and has underpinned the successful completion of numerous bacterial genomes and the Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These triumphs have been achieved without a radical change in technology. Fluorescent labelling of Sanger dideoxy chain termination method remains the primary sequencing chemistry. The major changes in methodology have been an increase in the size of DNA fragment to be attacked; from small lambda clone (kb's), through cosmids (10's kb), BACs (100's kb) to entire chromosomes or bacterial genomes (Mb's). Recently, The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) and Perkin-Elmer announced an initiative which, in theory, revolutionalizes genomic sequencing. The arrival of capillary technology may hold the key to cheaper, raster sequencing. It re-opens old debates and at the least requires a reappraisal of what is the most cost effective strategy for genomic sequencing. SESSION ONE Saturday June 20*, 0900-1300. LESSONS LEARNT FROM LEISHMANIA AJ Ivens (Dept. of Biochemistry, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, Exhibition Road, London SW7 2AZ, UK.) As part of the UNDPAVorld Bank/WHO-TDR parasite genomes initiative, our laboratory has been involved in the construction of a physical map of the Leishmania major Friedlin reference strain. The map has been assembled by the combination of fingerprint analysis of a shuttle vector cosmid library and probe hybridisation. The integrated data obtained from the fingerprints and over 1000 probes have placed approximately 94% of the -33.6Mb genome into contigs representative of the 36 chromosomes. Sequencing tile sets have been identified, and a number of sequencing projects are underway within the Leishmania Genome Network. The data obtained from the Leishmania genome project have been analysed for possible functional significance, the output of which will be described. Data from the genome project are publicly available on the WWW at: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/parasites/leish.html HAPPY MAPPING OF CRYPTOSPORIDIUM PARVUM. Michael B. Piper, Alan T. Bankier and Paul H. Dear. (MRC Ixihoratory of Molecular Biology, Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Division, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 2QH, England.) HAPPY mapping is a fast and accurate method for the physical mapping of genomes Many parasite genomes are difficult to map by traditional methods due to their unusual biological characteristics, e.g. genomic regions with high AT contents can lead to instability of bacterial clones. HAPPY mapping is an entirely in-vitro method and hence mapping is unaffected by such biological phenomena. A HAPPY mapping panel is constructed by breaking genomic DNA at random and then taking samples, each containing less than one genomes worth of DNA, from this pool of random fragments. Breaks between closely linked markers are rare, and these markers tend to co-segregate on the same DNA fragments, and hence also co-segregate in the same samples. Breaks between widely spaced markers are more common and hence they co-segregate less frequently. The principle is similar to that used in genetic mapping, when recombination between closely linked markers during meiosis is rare. We have constructed a HAPPY map of the apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium pannim It 66 consists of over 130 STS (sequence tagged site) markers, which have been screened against a HAPPY mapping panel by nested PCR. They fall into 10 contigs. Cryptosporidium is believed to have 8 chromosomes and a genome size of ~10.4Mb, meaning that there are only 2 gaps in the map and that on average there is a marker every 78kb. The map is expected to be accurate to about 30kb, and was constructed by a single person in under six months. In addition we have constructed a PAC ( 1 artificial chromosome) library of Cryptosporidium with an average insert size of 38kb. The library is publicly available, and in conjunction with the map, should greatly facilitate genomic studies of this organism. ABOUT THE TINY NUCLEAR GENOME OF MICROSPORIDIA obligate intracellular parasites, with a wide host spectrum, represent a large group of pathogens of veterinary and medical importance mainly in ADDS patients. They can form a very small spore, contain 70S ribosomes and are devoid of mitochondria. The haploid genome size varies between 2.3 Mbp and 19.6 Mbp and the number of chromosomes between 8 and 16, according to species. Karyotype polymorphism has been shown in Eiwephalitozoon cuniculi. The variants discriminated on the basis of rDNA ITS structure may be heterogeneous as regard to the karyotype. The analysis of the E. cuniculi genome was performed through the systematic sequencing of the smallest chromosome (217 kbp) and the screening of a partial genomic library. The repetitive DNA comprises short micro\u00ad and minisatellites and rDNA units dispersed over all the chromosomes. SSU and LSU rRNAs are very reduced as a result from the deletion of numerous variable regions. Currently, concerning chromosome I, a set of 30 randomly arranged contigs represents a total length of 180 kbp with 30 genes including 21 ORFs for known proteins and 9 ORFs with unknown function. Some intergenic regions are very short (DHFR,TS,SHMT contig) and the intron frequency very low. The sequence alignment of promoter regions suggests 2 boxes which may be involved in the initiation of transcription. A downstream box complementary to a part of the decoding region of the 16S rRNA frequently occur and can play a role in traduction initiation. A typical polyadenylation signal is often present. The mitochondrial signature of an HSP70 gene supports that microsporida have secondarily lost mitochondria. With respect to proteins specifically associated to the major part of the invasive apparatus (polar tube), two different genes, close together on the chromosome VI, are of potential interest for diagnosis and therapeutics. TOWARDS A PHYSICAL MAP OF BRUGIA MALAYI : NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE Mains Road Edinburgh EH9 3JT, UK. 'The Sanger Centre, Wellcome Trust Genome Cambridge, CB10 ISA, UK) The Brugia malayi genome project is an international collaborative effort between seven laboratories funded by the WHO and MRC. The goal of this project is the identification of thousands of new Brugia genes and their placement on a medium resolution physical map. Over 14,000 ESTs have been sequenced from stage\u00adspecific B. malayi cDNA libraries. When grouped by sequence identity these 14,000 ESTs form over 5,000 clusters. A consensus sequence for each cluster has been generated from a multiple alignment of the constituent ESTs and this has been used in subsequent database analyses. The B. malayi physical map will be generated by hybridisation of several thousand Brugia genes identified during the EST sequencing phase of the project and BAC and YAC end probes selected using a sampling without replacement strategy. Generation of high quality genomic libraries has been complicated by AT bias (\u00ad70%) of Brugia genomic DNA and the presence of a bacterial endosymbiote which efficiently clones into cosmid and BAC vectors. However we are now entering into the preliminary mapping phase of the project with over two dozen Brugia genes mapped to our BAC filters and the initiation of several walking experiments. A single BAC containing the genomic copy of Bm\u00adMIF\u00ad1 has been selected and is being sequenced at the Sanger Center. Construction of a physical map and the sequencing of a large piece of 67 Brugia genomic DNA will allow several important questions to be answered about nematode genomic organisation including the presence of op\u00e9rons, transposons, and the possibility of synteny between Brugia and Spezielle Zoologie, Technical University Dresden, Germany.

The life cycle of Nosema grylli consists of three phases: infective, proliferative and sporogonial. The nuclear division, which occurs during the proliferative phase, involves a sequence of mitosis in the meronts and sporonts. The nuclear apparatus or \"diplokaryon\", consists of two closely adjacent nuclei, each of which is surrounded by a typical nuclear envelope. Diplokaryon is a very characteristic peculiarity of microsporidian intracellular stages, which allows them to be easily recognised in samples by different kinds of DNA-specific stains, e.g. by DAPI-staining. In dyplokaryotic nuclei of meronts and sporonts, closed intranuclear pleuromitosis was described. In this type of mitosis, the nuclear envelope stays intact; the entire mitotic apparatus is localized into the nucleus and the spindle is organised by special microtubule-organizing centres (MTOCs), so-called \"centriolar plaques\". In the course of mitosis chromosomes are weakly condensed and do not form a metaphase plate. Thus, the exact determination of the chromosome number by TEM is difficult. To obtain the detailed information on the chromosome content and basic genome organisation of M grylli, the transverse alternating field electrophoresis (TAFE) was used. By TAFE, using a program for DNA separation within a wide size range (50- lOOOkb), a set of chromosomal DNAs . grylli with the sizes 95-450kb was revealed. To separate numerous DNA molecules of similar sizes, a program with discrete increasing of pulse time was elaborated. It revealed 14 chromosomal bands ranging in size from 95 to 440kb. The total genome size of N. grylli, estimated on the basis of chromosomal DNA sizes, is about 3460kb. The method of chromosomal DNA purification from intracellular stages of N. grylli was adapted. The attempt to compare the molecular karyotype from spores and intracellular stages of N. grylli was done. There seems to be no difference between electrophoretical patterns of DNA from infective and proliferative stages of the ', grylli life cycle. Our data were compared to earlier reports on chromosomal DNAs from other species of the Nosema genus. The size of chromosomes of other species ranged from 139 to 1810 kb. The Nosema spp. from Orthoptera have the smallest genome sizes within the genus and have no chromosomal DNAs greater than lOOOkb. The variations of chromosome and genome sizes within Nosema spp. confirms the heterogenity of this genus, which has been discussed by Sprague, Issi and other authors (Sprague et al., 1992; Issi, 1986). Recent studies on phylogenetic relationships among Nosema spp. based on ribosomal RNA sequence data confirmed that this genus is composed of several unrelated groups (Baker et al., 1994). ONGOING CONSTRUCTION OF AN RFLP LINKAGE MAP OF EIMERIA TENELLA: (USE OF RAPD-PCR AND AFLP MARKERS) M. W. Shirley Institute for Animal Compton, Nr Newbury, Berks. RG20 7NN An of the genome ofEimeria tenella. The map derives from analyses of the inheritance of polymorphic DNA markers in 22 cloned progeny of a genetic cross made between two parents characterised by complementary phenotypic traits. The map currently comprises just over 200 polymorphic markers, of which those defined by RAPD-PCR and, especially, AFLP are the most numerous. The results of an experimental cross which used parents with phenotypes of precocious development (attenuation) and resistance to arprinocid are providing insights into the behaviour of Eimeria chromosomes during meiosis and reveal an association between two different chromosomes and resistance to arprinocid or precocious development. Some findings include: 68 The extent of crossing-over between homologous chromosomes varies considerably within the karyotype and, for example, is substantially greater for chromosomes 1 and 2 than for chromosome chromosomes 9, 10 and 14. The frequency of DNA markers identified varies for the different chromosomes. For example, chromosomes 9, 11 and 14 are substantially over-represented in comparison to chromosome 10. Most chromosomes are characterised by a combination of polymorphic AFLP, RAPD-PCR and RFLP markers but, perhaps surprisingly, no AFLP markers have been identified for some chromosomes, including chromosome 14 which, at more than about 7 Mbp, is the largest in E. tenella. Linkage is inferred between arprinocid resistance and chromosome 1 and precocious development and (putative) chromosome 9. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CRYPTOSPORIDIUM PARVUM KARYOTYPE S. Cacci\u00f2. R. Camilli, G. La Rosa, E. Pozio Laboratory of Parasitology, Istituto Superiore Sanit\u00e0, Rome, Italy In several protozoa, including parasitic species, the chromatin is poorlycondensed during mitosis and distinct chromosomes can not be visualized. A breakthrough in the study of the genomes of parasites and of other lower eukaryotes was the development of the Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis CPFGE) technique, which allows for the separation of intact chromosomes. The use of PFGE has been instrumental for describing karyotypes, determining the ploidy status and genome size, investigating chromosomal polymorphisms and mapping of genes. So far, such studies have been conducted on important parasites such as Trypanosoma, Leishmania, Giardia, Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, Eimeria, Babesia and Theileria. We are interested in the study of the chromosome organization in the coccidian parasite Cryptosporidium parvum and our goal is the development of a physical map of the genome. So far, PFGE analysis of the C. parvum chromosomes revealed the presence of five bands in the 1-1.5 Mb range. However, it has been suggested that at least two of these bands are composed of multiple chromosomes very similar in size, which comigrate during the electrophoresis. This situation has hampered the determination of the chromosome number and size and also complicates the assigment of genes and of other DNA sequences to individual chromosomes. Since resolution of these bands into individual components is difficult to achieve, we have used restriction enzymes to cut chromosomes into fragments which can be more easily resolved by PFGE. Considering the AT-richness of the C. parvum genome, several restriction enzymes recognizing GC-rich motifs have been used. On the basis of these initial experiments. Noti and Sfil enzymes were selected for this study. The optimal separation of the Noti and Sfil restriction fragments in the low, intermediate and high molecular size range was obtained with three different PFG electrophoretic conditions. These experiments showed that the karyotype is comprised of eight chromosomes, ranging in size from approximately 0.95 to 1.45 Mb; of the eight chromosomes, five were cut by the Sfil enzyme whereas only three were cut by the Noti enzyme, confirming the rarity of GC-rich motifs in the genome. The genome size of C parvum was estimated to be 9.6 Mb in size, a figure very close to that reported for Theileria parva and Babesia bovis (about 10 Mb), but quite different from that of two other coccidians, Toxoplasma gondii and Eimeria tenella, which have larger genomes (50-80 Mb). To confirm the identity of the chromosomes and of their restriction fragments, Southern blots of the PFGE gels were probed with a series of 20 markers, representing 16 coding sequences, the ribosomal DNA, a pair of repetitive DNA sequences and a telomeric repeated sequence, (TTAGGG)n. All gene probes hybridized to individual chromosomes or to their restriction fragments, as expected form their single-copy nature, whereas hybridization with the ribosomal DNA probe revealed the presence of 5 copies that were scattered over four different chromosomes. Finally, all chromosomes and restriction fragment hybridized with a telomeric probe, indicating that no internal fragments were generated by either Noti or Sfil restriction. Recently, a general model of chromosome organization in parasites has been proposed. This model suggests that chromosomes are compartmentalized into conserved central domains and polymorphic chromosome ends. The central domain is highly transcribed and contains most of the structural genes, whereas the regions close to the telomeres contain few structural genes but several repetitive elements and have low transcriptional activity. The development of a physical map will help to clarify whether this particular organization is conserved in C. \u00a1xtnnim 69 SESSION TWO Saturday June 20*, 14.30-16.00 GENE DISCOVERY AND GENETIC VARIA HON IN CRYPTOSPORIDIUM AND TOXOPLASMA. F. Spano*. L. Putignani^ Ricci', M. Di Cristina*, C. Purir, and A. Crisanti''\u00b7* * Istituto di Parassitologia e * Istituto di Istologia e Embriologia Generale. Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"La Sapienza\", Rome, Italy; ' Imperial College, Department of Biology, London, U.K. The invasive stages of the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii are known to express a set of surface antigens, known as the SAG proteins, sharing structural and functional characteristics. These molecules, which are anchored to the plasmamembrane via a GPI motif, are differentially expressed in sporozoites, tachyzoites and bradyzoites and are believed to play a role in the early steps of host cell invasion. The most extensively characterized among the SAG proteins are S AGI (p30), which is expressed exclusively in the tachyzoites and represents the immunodominant antigen during T. gondii infection (Burg et al., J. Immunol. 141: 3584-3591, 1988) and SAG3 (p43), which is present in all invasive stages (Cesbron-Delauw et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269: 16217-16222, 1994). These two molecules share approximately 40% amino acid identity and the presence of two amino acid repeats each containing 6 cysteine residues at conserved positions. T. gondii lines defective for either SAG1 or SAG3 have been shown to possess a reduced invasive activity. Recently, a series of novel T. gondii proteins sharing close structural similarity with SAG1 and SAG3 have been identified: SRS1-4 and 89: 271-282, 1997) and SAG5 in our laboratory. A portion of the SAG5 gene was accidentally amplified from the genomic DNA of T. gondii (RH strain) employing unrelated primers. The PCR product 12G/16, encoding a 212 amino acid-long polypeptide showing a significant homology to both S AGI and SAG3, was used as a probe to screen a genomic T. gondii cosmid library. Southern blot analysis of the positive cosmidic clones and of T. gondii genomic DNA employing the 12G/16 fragment as a probe yielded complex hybridization patterns, suggesting the existence, in the genome of T. gondii, of a family of related genes. Extensive sequence analysis confirmed this hypothesis and revealed the presence of three tightly clustered genes encoding closely related proteins, denominated SAGS. 1, SAGS.2 and SAG5.3. All three polypeptides show the hallmarks of the family of S AGI-related molecules, being characterized by a leader peptide, 12 cysteine residues whose distribution suggests a tandem duplication of an ancestral 6-cysteine motif and a C-terminal GPI-anchoring signal. SAG5.2 and SAG5.3 are 367 amino acid-long and differ from each other at 8 amino acid positions (98% identity), while SAG5.1, which consists of 362 amino acids, is virtually identical to the other two SAG5 proteins only within the C-terminal region (positions 162- 362). Notably, in the N-terminal half of the molecule the degree of amino acid identity to SAG5.2/SAG5.3 drops to approximately 40%, which represents the average homology shared by all members of the \"SAGT protein family. Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis of poly(A)+ RNA showed that all three SAG5 genes are expressed in tachyzoites. The transcriptional activity in the other invasive stages is under study. The localization of the SAG5 proteins in T. gondii tachyzoites was investigated employing polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against a recombinant histidine-tagged fragment of S AGS. 3 produced in E. coli and affinity purified by nickel chelate chromatography. In contrast with the other S AGI-related proteins, immunofluorescence analysis failed to show for SAG5 any significant staining of the tachyzoite plasmamembrane. Instead, anti-SAGS antibodies specifically decorated the apical end of the tachyzoites. This evidence was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy experiments in which anti-SAG5 antibodies were shown to label the cytoplasmic side of the tachyzoite pellicle and electrondense structures possibly associated with the microtubular components of the apical complex. In our search for Cryptosporidium proteins potentially involved in the invasion process we have recently cloned a C. parvum incomplete cDNA encoding a polypeptide, named cysteine-rich sporozoite protein (CRSP), possessing adhesive amino acid motifs. CRSP is a novel thrombospondin-related protein that adds to TRAP-Cl, a micronemal protein recently cloned in our laboratory and sharing structural similarity to EtplOO of \u00a3 tenella and MIC2 of T. gondii. The CRSP gene is highly expressed in sporozoites. Work is in progress to clone the entire ORF encoding CRSP and to establish the exact sub\u00ad cellular location of this molecule. Our interest in C. parvum has recently extended to the study of the parasite genetic variation. Most of the C. pan'um typing studies carried out to date are based on the analysis of single polymorphisms. A multilocus approach has the potential to better define the structure of the C. parvum 70 population and assess the degree of genetic isolation of the H and C subpopulations. With this in mind we genotyped 28 C. parvum isolates of various host and geographical origin by simultaneously analysing up to five polymorphic loci belonging to at least three distinct linkage groups. Isolates were from Europe, North and South America and Australia. Seventeen isolates originated directly from humans, 3 were derived from humans and propagated in calves, and 8 were from various animals. Human isolates were both from sporadic cases and from documented outbreaks. Two isolates were derived from ADDS patients. Animal samples included the widely used Moredun and GCH1 isolates. The five polymorphic loci selected for this study have been shown to consist of at least two alleles differentially associated with animal or human C. parvum isolates. Four of the genetic markers were analysed by polymerase chain reaction\u00adrestriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR\u00adRFLP) assays and corresponded residing within the internal transcribed spacer region 1 (ITS1) of the Type A ribosomal unit, was analysed 712\u00ad716, 1996). Consistent with previous studies, isolates segregated into two groups, one comprising both human and animal isolates, the other only isolates of human origin. No recombinant genotype was detected. This evidence, together with the broad geographical distribution of the multilocus genotypes identified, brings further support to the hypothesis that C. parvum reproduction is substantially clonal. FIRST A TTEMPTS TO ISOLA 99, -1180 Brussels, Belgium. 3 Johannes Gutenberg fur Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Augustusplatz/Hochhaus, D-55\u00a101 Mainz, Germany) When peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Cryptosporidium parvum infected neonatal calves are stimulated with crude Cryptosporidium oocyst extract they produce BFNy. Depletion of different T\u00adcell subsets revealed that CD4+ cells are involved. A low molecular weight (LM) oocyst\u00ad derived antigen fraction that evoke this immuneresponse could be partially purified. This LM fraction consists of a simple protein pattern with bands below 50 kDa. However, efforts to identify\u00b7 the antigen(s) that was/were responsible for the stimulation of IFNv production were hampered by the low quantities of antigen available. Therefore we have chosen to screen a Cryptosporidium cDNA library for recombinant antigens involved in this cell response. In this presentation we present preliminary work done so far, showing the different strategic approaches that have been applied. U\u00cf, RECOMBINANT SALMONELLA AS CARRIER FOR f Intervet International, PO Box 31, 3830 AA coccidiosis, an enteritis which is of significant economic loss in the poultry industry. At present, coccidiosis is mainly controlled by the use of antibiotics. However, the emergence of drug resistant Eimeria strains, requires the development of alternative methods of control. We are presently analysing various Eimeria antigens for their protective immunity in subunit vaccines. For this purpose live recombinant Salmonella strains are used, expressing Eimeria gene products. Attenuated Salmonella strains, expressing heterologous antigens, are known to induce an immune response against other parasites, like Plasmodium and Leishmania. However, expression of toxic gene products or overexpression of the foreign antigens limits the survival of these recombinant Salmonella in the host. To circumvent this problem, an expression system was developed and optimised, in which foreign antigen expression is dependent on the orientation of an invertible promoter. The invertible promoter will be either in the \"ON\" or \"OFF\" orientation, resulting in a mixed Salmonella population. \"OFF\" Salmonella will not transcribe heterologous proteins and \"ON\" Salmonella will transcribe them. 71 The subpopulation in the \"ON\" orientation will be overexpressing the heterologous proteins, and as a result will be inhibited in its growth. The \"OFF\" subpopulation is not growth inhibited, and shall maintain the population, from which also new \"ON\" Salmonella will be generated, each time that inversion takes place. We will present our expression system in Salmonella typhimurium. It utilises a genomically inserted T7 RNA polymerase driven by an invertible promoter. T7 RNA polymerase subsequently transcribes our heterologous antigens, located on an expression plasmid. Green fluorescent protein was initially expressed to show with FACS studies, that inversion indeed occurs. Furthermore, studies with broiler chickens will be presented to show the stability of our expression system ;/; vivo and to demonstrate the induced protection against coccidiosis. CHARA CTERISA OF Switzerland) Neospora caninum is structurally and biologically closely related to, but antigenically distinct from, Toxoplasma gotidii. N. caninum is an obligatory intracellular parasite, with two stages, namely tachyzoites and bradyzoites, being identified to date. Molecules associated with the surface and with secretory organelles are likely to participate in the host cell entry process, and they could influence the pathogenesis of neosporosis. Therefore, our investigations have aimed towards the identification and characterization of surface-associated proteins ofN. caninum tachyzoites. Two proteins namely Nc-p43 and Nc-p36 have been identified and characterized. The cDNA coding for these two proteins has been sequenced. Nc-p36 is highly homologous to p30 (SAG1) from T. gondii, while Nc-p43 exhibits a lesser degree of similarity to Toxoplasma surface proteins. Recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli. Immunogold electronmicroscopy using antibodies affinity-purified on these recombinant proteins showed that Nc-p36 is found exclusively on the surface of N. caninum tachyzoites, while epitopes reacting with anti-Nc-p43 antibodies were found on the surface and within the parasite dense granules. Most likely both proteins are anchored into the surface membrane via a GPI-anchor. Nc-p36 is expressed exclusively in the tachyzoite stage, while Nc-p43 can be detected in both tachyzoites and bradyzoites. Further studies will be aimed towards the functional characterization of these two surface proteins and their immunological significance during infection. IMMUNOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF SOME SOL UBLE AND MEMBRANE BOUND MICROSPORIDIAN ANnGENS Julia Sokolova (All-Russian Institute of Plant Protection, Agrie. Sci., St. Petersburg, Russia) Microsporidia (phylum Microspora) (M) is the group of vast distributed (from Protozoa to Primates including Humans) intracellular parasitic protists, baring very primitive and very specialized features simultaneously. RNA and DNA sequences suggest they are probably the most ancient eukaryots. Information about structural, transport and regulatory proteins of M, as well as on their enzymes is scarce, though it may serve the basis for the understanding of M pathogenicity and indicate the possible sites of suppressive therapy. The experimental host-parasite system: Gryllus bimaculatus - Nosema grylli we are working with, has certain advantages to perform biochemical and immunological studies on parasite antigenes. The present study persuaded two main goals: (1) to examine diff\u00e8rent ways of antigen preparation and to evaluate their influence on the resulted poly- and monoclonal antibodies; (2) to identify and localize new proteins with the help of obtained antibodies by means of immunofluorescent assay analysis, immune electron microscopy and Western Blots. Besides two types of highly specific immune sera, the following monoclinal antibodies antibodies were obtained: (1) 1BF3 recognized a protein of 55 kDa that is connected with the spore filament as it was clearly suggested by IEM and IF A; (2) 1BD9 recognized the 25, 34, 43 kDa proteins associated with spore walls; (3) 1BB9 reacted with 36, 45, 65 and 75 kDa proteins and gave weak fluorescence around spores; (4) 2BB3 recognized 44 and 55 kDa proteins; (5) 2BD4 - a single protein of 54 kDa. The obtained antibodies add to the existing microsporidian antibody bank and can be used for the further work of isolation, description and sequencing the microsporidian proteins to understand their functions. 72 GUESTLECTURE Saturday 20* June, 17.00-17.45 \"THE ROLE OF AND INVASION BY TOXOPLASMA GONDII David Sibley, University of Washington, USA SESSION THREE Sunday June 21\" 0900-1300 TOOLS FOR THE GENETICMANIPULATIONOF TOXOPLASMA GONDII AND THEIR APPLICA TO STUDY HOST CELL IN\\rASION. S. Brecht, . Frank, A Geiter, C. (Zentrum sequencing project for Toxoplasma.gondii has generated over 10,000 ESTs resulting in an explosion of gene discovery. A significant number of sequences revealed homologies to genes phylogenetically restricted to the Apicomplexa which are potentially playing crucial role in the establishment of intracellular parasitism. The apicomplexan-specific proteins include apical antigens involved in recognition and adhesion of host cells, proteins associated with specific life cycle stages, and unique metabolic enzymes involved in energy production. However a genome sequence is useless as long as the function of a gene can not be tested. T. gondii is particularly well-suited to laboratory study and its accessibility to genetic manipulation provides the opportunity to explore many questions relevant to the biology and pathogenicity of this organism and its closest relatives. The repertoire of molecular genetic tools currently available offers great potentials and some limits to study the function of both non-essential and essential genes. We have applied some of these tools to study proteins potentially implicated in the process of invasion. Apicomplexan parasites rely on an unusual form of gliding motility for host cell invasion. The basic engine for gliding locomotion is the actin cytoskeleton and likely involves a myosin to generate the mechanochemical force along the actin filaments. We have cloned and characterised two T. gotviii myosins by a PCR screen of parasite genomic DNA. The two myosins, MyoA 93 kDa (recently described by Heintzelman and Schwartzman) and MyoD 91 kDa belong to a novel phylogenetic and structural class of myosins (XIV). To identify which myosin might be involved in invasion, we have first determined the subcellular localisation of MyoA and MyoD using epitope tagging of coding sequences and stable transformation into tachyzoites. Whereas MyoD is more diffusely found at the periphery of the cell, the sharply defined plasma membrane localisation of MyoA makes it a good candidate as motor of the gliding motility. Moreover, a parasite transmembrane protein is necessary to associate tightly with the host cell surface and to transfer the mechanical force across the plasma membrane. The C-terminal domain shall be establishing directly or indirectly a connection with the actin cytoskeleton and inducing gliding motility. The Plasmodium berghei TRAP protein appears to fulfil this double function in malarial sporozoites. Mie 2 has been recently described as the homologue of TRAP in T. gondii, and was the only known protein bearing a transmembrane domain. We have cloned and characterised a novel T. gondii microneme protein which carries EGF-like domains as well as the conserved C-terminal domain, including the transmembrane region common to the family of TRAP proteins. Mie 4 coding sequence predicts a protein of 34 kDa which appears to be present as a dimer in the parasite. 73 THE CURRENT STATUS OF TRANSFECnON IN PLASMODIUM BERGHEI. T. de Koning\u00adWard (Department RC Leiden The Netherlands.) Although genetic transfection in Plasmodium still requires further development, it is now possible using the currently available technology to express introduced transgenes in Plasmodium and disrupt malarial genes by site\u00adspecific homologous recombination. These recent advances in the transfection of Plasmodium provide not only a means to determine the necessity of specific malarial gene products but allow a more detailed analysis of many aspects of the parasite's cellular biology, including the mechanisms underlying drug resistance. In this presentation, we will describe the methods used to stably transfect the rodent malarial pathogen, P. berghei as well as the expression of the exogenous reporter, green fluorescent protein. We will also show the effect of disrupting two genes that are specific to the mosquito stage of the parasite's life cycle: (i) the S\u00adtype ribosomal RNA genes, and (ii) the Pbs21 gene which encodes an ookinete surface protein that has been implicated as a potential transmission blocking vaccine candidate. The ability to complement these disrupted genes in trans to help elucidate the function of these gene products in P. berghei is not yet feasible due to the lack of another suitable selectable marker. In this report we will also discuss the approaches currently taken towards finding additional selectable markers in P. berghei and what further tools are required to fully exploit transfection technology in this parasite. TRANSIENT TRANSFECHON OF E. TENELLA AND HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION OF MICRONEME PROTEINS INT. GONDII (Institute for Animal Health, Compton, Newbury, RG20 7NN UK) A transient transfection system was developed Eimeria tenella, using \u00df\u00adgalactosidase (\u00dfgal) as a reporter enzyme. Successfully expressed constructs contained transcriptional control sequences, derived from either the E. tenella microneme gene \u00a3ftnic\u00adl or from the E. tenella actin gene, fused to the coding region oilacZ. Transfectants expressing \u00dfgal were able to invade host cells and proceed through part of the life\u00adcycle, forming schizonts from which merozoites were released. Some merozoites which arose from transfected sporozoites were also found to express \u00dfgal. These results are encouraging for the development of a stable transfection system for E tenella, using \u00dfgal as a reporter enzyme. Micronemes which are conserved across the phylum Apicomplexa and which are critical for the early stages of host cell invasion by these parasites. Microneme proteins (mies) are expressed late during the process of oocyst sporulation and again during the maturation of intracelllular schizonts and are assembled into the micronemes by an, as yet, uncharacterised process. To help understand how mies reach their target organelle, we have expressed two E. tenella mies in the related coccidian Toxoplasma gondii, generating stable lines of T. gondii which express either \u00a3miic\u00adl or Etnac-2 in addition to the normal complement of T. gondii mies.. Both proteins were expressed in T. gondii but whereas Etnuc-2 was targetted to the apical tip, the majority of Etmic-l was not. Further recombinants are now being generated to examine targetting signals in more detail. The successful expression of two E. tenella mies in T. gondii demonstrates the value of this heterologous system for experimental analysis of E tenella proteins. HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINA THE GRA2 LOCUS CA and LD. Sibley (Washington University School of Medicine, Department of Molecular Microbiology, Saint- Louis, MO, US.) Following invasion into the host cell. Toxoplasma gondii secretes a variety of proteins that modify the parasitophorous vacuole. Amongst them, the 28\u00adkDa dense granule protein GRA2 is specifically targeted to the tubulo\u00advesicular network connected to the vacuolar membrane.To investigate the function of GRA2, a mutant T. gondii line was derived from the RH strain in which GRA2 was disrupted by replacement with the selectable marker Ble. The mutation does not affect the parasite 74 growth rate in vitro. However, the mutant was less virulent during acute infection in mice. In contrast to the wild\u00adtype strain which always leads to death in infected mice, 44?/o of infected mice survived acute infection with the knock\u00adout line. Moreover, chronic infection was demonstrated by the presence of both parasites and cysts immunohistochemically detected in the brain of infected animals, six weeks post\u00ad infection. Thus, absence of GRA2 partially attenuates the virulence of T. gondii during the acute phase of infection by the otherwise highly virulent RH strain. STRUCTURE TO FUNCHONANALYSIS OF THE ADHESIVE DOMAINS WITHIN TRAP (THROMBOSPONDIN RELA TED ADHESIVE PROTEIN) OF P. FACUPARUM Firman Ghouze and Andrea Crisanti. Department of Biology, Imperial College of Science, Technology mid M\u00e9decine Prince Consort Road, London, SW7 2BB The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum expresses specifically at the sporozoite stage the thrombospondin related adhesive protein (TRAP). An increasing amount of evidence indicates that this protein plays an important role in hepatocyte invasion. TRAP contains several highly conserved amino acid sequences. One amino acid motif based around the sequence WSPCSTVCGKGXRXR, known as region II, is also present in the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of different Plasmodium species and other unrelated adhesive proteins. Studies have demonstrated that this region confers to the proteins the ability to bind to sulphated glycoconjugates and to hepatocytes. TRAP also contains, at its amino terminal region, a sequence of approximately 200 amino acids known as the \u00addomain. This domain is present in a number of integrins and mediates binding to various surface ligands. Additionally, TRAP off. falciparum contains a RGD motif which has been demonstrated to be essential in the interaction of several extracellular glycoproteins with members of the integrin superfamily. In this study we have analysed the structure to function relationship of these adhesive domains within the TRAP molecule. For this purpose we have generated, expressed and purified a series of TRAP constructs carrying a series of substitutions in specific amino acid residues. Furthermore a construct with a deletion spanning the 15 amino acids of region , named TRAP 1.0R2\u00ad was also generated. The binding activity of these constructs to both immobilised sulphatides and different tumour derived cell lines has been assessed. Data show that region II and the A domain but not the RGD motif play a role in binding. These findings further our understanding of the molecular interactions which occur during hepatocyte invasion. SPECIFIC TERMINAL DELEHONS CAN BE INDUCED ON Marta Ponzi. Laboratory of Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, Rome, Italy Large subtelomeric rearrangements are often responsible for chromosome size polymorphisms often observed in Plasmodium. The instability of chromosome ends has been shown to be mostly associated with the loss of subtelomeric genes. Moreover, large deletions of terminal portions of chromosome 5 in P. berghei and chromosome 9 in P.falciparum correlate with the loss of gametocytogenesis in laboratory infections or in cultures. A linear vector containing a selectable marker and telomeric sequences was constructed and shown to be able to induce, in transfection experiments, specific chromosome deletions when provided with a short genomic region homologous to the target site. This new approach will allow to verify the phenotipic effect of controlled chromosome deletions and to study position effects exerted on functions located in the vicinity of the breakage point. COMPARISON OF THE HOST/PARASITE RELA nONSHIP Ferguson Nuffield Department of Pathology, Oxford University, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. The host parasite relationship of Toxoplasma gondii during coccidian (asexual and sexual) development in cat and tachyzoite and bradyzoite the intermediate host was examined by electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. T. gondii undergoes a unique form of asexual (endopolygony) and sexual development only within the enterocytes of the cat and no other species or cell type. 75 Ultrastructural examination of host parasite relationship shows that the enteric forms are located within a parasitophorous (PV) which is significantly different from that described for all other forms of the parasite. The various sexual and asexual stages are located within a tight fitting PV limited by thickened membrane with a laminated substructure. This membrane appear to be the result of the fusion of three unit membranes. A number of conical shaped indentations are located on the parasite side of the PV. There was no evidence of an intravacular network or the collecting of host cell mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum around the PV which are characteristic of the tachyzoite PV. It Is possible that this unique host/parasite relationship and the coccidian devlopment of the parasite are interrelated. The biological nature of the PV formed in cat enterocytes is unclear but is appears to be triggered at the time of parasite penetration. The expression and location of the dense granule proteins (GRA 1\u00ad6 and NTPase) in the merozoite and during coccidian development of T. gondii in the small intestine of the cat (definitive host) has been examined by immuno\u00adlight and electron microscopy. This was compared with that of tachyzoites and bradyzoites present in the intermediate host. It was found that the merozoite contained the characteristic apical organelles plus a few large dense granules. By immunocytochemistry, these granules were negative for GRA proteins 1 to 6 in contrast to both tachyzoites and bradyzoites where dense granules were positive for all six proteins. The GRA proteins were associated with the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) during tachyzoite and bradyzoite development but were absent from the PV of the coccidian stages. However the dense granules were positive for NTPase which was similar to the tachyzoite but appears to be down regulated in the bradyzoite. The apparent release of the NTPase into the V was also similar to that described for the tachyzoite. This may reflect the relative metabolic activity of the various stages. This study shows that eof the GRA proteins has a similar stage specfic expression which is independant of NTPase expression. These observations are consistent with T. gondii having a different host parasite relationship in the enteric forms which does not involve the GRA proteins. T. gondii is a coccidian parasite with the cat as its definitive host but any warm blooded animal, including Man, can act as an intermediate host. In the intermediate host the parasite undergoes an acute phase where the tachyzoites reproduces rapidly followed by a chronic phase when the bradyzoites reproduce slowing giving rise to tissue cysts which are found predominantly in muscle and brain. These tissues cysts are believed to remain viable for long periods and can transmit the infection if eaten by other intermediate hosts or the cat. In the case of the cat, infection results in typical coccidian asexual and sexual development in the small intestine with the production of oocysts which are passed in cat faeces (Hutchison et al 1971, Frenkel and Dubey 1970). T. gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite and can only proliferate within nucleated cells. Therefore the interaction with the host cell is vital for parasite survival. The tachyzoite and bradyzoite are ubiquitous in the host species and cell type within which development can occur. In contrast, the coccidian development is restricted to single host species and cell type and to date no in vitro model exists. Due to the ease of obtaining parasites, the host/parasite relationship has been extensively studied in the tachyzoite. DURING INVASION EIMERIA J.M Newbury, Berkshire, RG20 7NN). The invasion of in vitro cultured host cells by Eimeria tenella sporozoites involves the rapid relocalisation and secretion proteins. Microneme proteins are secreted from the apical end of the sporozoite and can be detected in the culture supernatant and also on the surface of host cells. Secretion is triggered by contact with cells and also by extracellular factors including serum and albumin. Microneme proteins can also be found in trails deposited by the sporozoite as it glides over the cell surface. If motility is inhibited with cytochalasins, secretion still occurs, but in this case microneme proteins are released apically and do not trail, presumably because the actin\u00admyosin motor which is essential for motility does not engage. This suggests that microneme proteins may form a bridge between the motility motor, located in the sub\u00adpellicular microfilaments and the surface of the host cell to which they bind via their many adhesive domains. 76 TO WARDS A FUNCTIONAL ANAL YSIS OF CYCLIN DEPENDENT PRO TEIN KINASES IN THEILERIA ANNULA TA. Jane H. Kinnaird. Mary Logan and Geoffrey Ingram (Dept of Veterinary Parasitology, University of Glasgow, Bearsden protein kinases which are intimately involved in regulating many essential cellular functions by phosphorylation of their target substrates. The activity of the kinase catalytic subunit is itself regulated by binding of a cyclin subunit and an inhibitor as well as by phosphorylation. Amongst the best characterised CDKs are those which are involved in regulating progression of the cell cycle although others have roles in cell cycle entry and in differentiation. In higher eukaryotes there is a large family of CDKs, whose activities are regulated by different cyclin partners. In lower eukaryotes there tend to be fewer CDKs, and notably in yeast, many elegant mutational studies have been carried out which demonstrate the essential role of these kinases. Amongst protozoan parasites, several genes encoding CDK related proteins have been isolated and none of these show the extremely high levels of conservation found in other eukaryotes. Two such genes have been characterised from Theileria annidata. The first, ThaCRK2 encodes a 34 kDa polypeptide which is most closely related to the CDK1/2 groups which regulate Gl\u00adS and G2\u00adM transitions of the cell cycle in other eukaryotes. ThaCRK2 RNA and protein are detectable in all dividing life cycle stages, which is consistent with a constitutive role in parasite division. Using a specific antiserum generated against recombinant ThaCRK2 we have shown that this protein localises to the cytoplasm in the macroschizont. In T. annulata the piroplasm stage does not show extensive multiplication but both Northern and Western blotting show a high levels of ThaCRK2 RNA and protein in comparison to signals obtained for other markers of nuclear division. This points to an additional role in the life cycle. The more recently isolated ThaCRK3 encodes a 45 kDa polypeptide with most significant homology to CDK7 which in combination with cyclin H is believed to activate some CDKs by phosphorylation. Although the relationship is not strong, a probable homologue, Pfrnrk, has been identified in Plasmodium falciparum. The RNA expression pattern of ThaCRK3 is distinct from ThaCRK2 in the different life cycle stages. 13 is a small protein originally identified in yeast and which has homologues in other eukaryotes. It is found complexed with some CDKs and has been extensively used in their purification. Recombinant histidine tagged pl3 coupled to sepharose has been used to affinity purify kinases from native extracts of T. annulata piroplasms. At least two kinase activities have been identified in this way, one of which is attributable to ThaCRK2. Prior immunodepletion of ThaCRK2 showed that at least one other kinase activity remained which showed a bias towards \u00adcasein as an in vitro substrate whereas extracts which were not depleted in ThaCRK2 showed more extensive phosphorylation of histone HI. These results confirm ThaCRK2 is active as a kinase in the piroplasm stage and also demonstrates that its substrate specificity is different from other kinases present in the extracts which can bind to yeast pl3. The ability to carry out Theileria transfection would greatly aid functional studies of these kinases in different life cycle stages. Preliminary studies have been carried out to establish transfection based on methods used for the intraerythrocytic stage o\u00ed Plasmodium spps. We have designed constructs using chloramphenicol acetyl transferase as a reporter linked to 5' and 3' regulatory regions of the T.annulata \u00df\u00adtubulin gene. A construct has also been made again using a CAT reporter but under the control of the putative 5' and 3' regulatory regions of Tarns I, a gene encoding a 30 kDa merozoite surface polypeptide, whose transcription is up\u00adregulated during differentiation to the merozoite. Various parameters of electroporation and use of different life cycle stages have not produced any conclusive evidence for parasite specific transient expression of the reporter. However the constructs based on the parasite \u00df\u00adtubulin control sequences gave significant transient expression of CAT originating from the host cell, indicating that sequences within this particular parasite promotor region can be recognised and used by host proteins. Work is now proceeding, in collaboration with Roger Hall's group at York University, to develop a selectable marker for transfection using sporozoite and infected lymphocyte stages as the initial targets. Other methods of introducing DNA are also being investigated. 77 INJSUGATING THEFUNCnONAL f1 Institute of Biomedical & Life Sciences, Division of Infection & Immunity, Joseph Black Building, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 800, UK. ^Wellcome Unit for Molectdar Parasitology, University of Glasgow. 3 Department of Parasitology, National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden.) Infection with Toxoplasma gondii is initially characterised by the rapid multiplication of tachyzoites followed by their differentiation into slowly-dividing bradyzoites and the formation of long- lasting tissue cysts. The transformation of tachyzoites into bradyzoites involves a dramatic change in the rate of ceil division, implying a high degree of control over cell-cycle. Regulators of the Toxoplasma cell cycle have until recently received little attention. Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which include the cdc2 kinases, are evolutionary conserved molecules many of which regulate the eukaryotic cell cycle. cdc2 was first identified in yeast, where it regulates both the Gl-S and G2-M phase cell cycle transitions, then subsequently in a wide range of eukaryotes. Using consensus primers we have identified a number of T.gondii cDNA and genomic clones which show close homology to eukaryotic CDKs. For one of the clones (designated TgCRK2) we have obtained a full length genomic sequence which encodes a predicted polypeptide of 33kDa that is most similar to the cdc2 type of CDK (< 55%). However, the with Plasmodium falciparum most closely related to cdc2. TgCRK2 contains the characteristic PST ATRE motif, implicated in the binding of activating cyclins of A, B, D and E types to CDKs. Transcripts of TgCRK2 could be detected in T.gondii M3 strain bradyzoites using RT-PCR but appeared to be relatively more abundant in the rapidly dividing RH and S48 strain tachyzoites. Western blotting of Toxoplasma tachyzoites using an antiserum against the conserved PSTAJJRE region detected a molecule of 32-33 kDa, consistent with the predicted size of TgCRK2, but also suggested the presence of other related molecules. We are currently using a number of approaches to analyse the functional significance of Toxoplasma CDKs including transient and stable transfection of TgCRK2 constructs in tachyzoites, homologous gene targeting, complementation and identification of the corresponding cyclin binding partners of Toxoplasma CDKs. 78 PROCEEDINGS COST 820 WG 2 Meeting COCCIDIOSIS IN PIGS 27th February 1998 Held at Central Veterinary Laboratory, Veterinary Laboratories Agency. rfS\u00b7\"\u00b7?'- ' . -'\u00cf ;?

We determined the full 18S rRNA gene (rDNA) sequences rattlesnake, and used these sequences for a phylogenetic analysis of the genus Isospora and the cyst-forming coccidia. Various alveolate 18S rDNA sequences were aligned and analyzed using maximum parsimony to obtain a phylogenetic hypothesis for the group. The two Isospora spp. were found to be most closely related to Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum. This clade in turn formed the sister group to the Sarcocystis spp. included in the analysis. The results confirm that the genus Isospora does not belong to the family Eimeriidae, but should be classified together with the cyst- forming coccidia in the family Sarcocystidae. Furthermore, there appear to be two lineages within the Sarcocystidae. One lineage comprises Isospora and the Toxoplasma!Neospora clade which share the characters of having a proliferative phase of development preceding gamogony in the definitive host and an exogenous phase of sporogony. The other lineage comprises the Sarcocystis spp. which have no proliferative phase in the definitive host and an endogenous phase of sporogony. A likely evolutionary scenario for heteroxeny in the group of coccidia with isosporan-type oocysts is that heteroxenous life cycles are derived features that have arisen independently in the different lineages, and that homoxenous Isospora spp. have retained the ancestral life cycle of the Isospora/'Toxoplasma/Neospora lineage. 81 OCCURRENCE OF ISOSPORA SUIS IN PIG BREEDING FARMS AND SPECIALIZED PIGLET REARING FARMS IN GERMANY Dr Arwid Daugschies Institut fur Parasitologie der Tieraztliche D-30559 Hannover, Germany words:- Isospora, pig, prevalence, Germany The prevalence Isospora suis in breeding farms with 12 to 238 sows was investigated by fecal examination of litters in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th week after farrowing. Two farms specialized in pig rearing with conventional weaning (CW) at an age of 4 to 5 weeks, or segregated early weaning (SEW) at an age of up to 21 days were also examined immediately after stalling up, 2 weeks later and at the end of the rearing period. I. suis was diagnosed in all farms. The prevalence increased during the suckling period from 17 to 19 % in the 2nd week to almost 40 % at the time of weaning. The cumulative prevalence in the litters was above 50 %. Diarrhoea was significantly associated with Isospora prevalence. In the farm managed according to the SEW system the prevalence decreased during rearing from 37.5 % to 19.3 % and 4.1 % and the occurrence of diarrhoea decreased simultaneously from 36.5 % to 11.0 % and 3.3 %. In the farm in which CW was practiced the Isospora prevalence ranged from 17.2 % to 21.9 % during the rearing period and diarrhoea was seen in about 34 % of the piglets at the first and second visit and decreased at the end of the rearing period to 5.7 %. Thus I. suis is a frequent endoparasite in piglet breeding farms irrespective of the size of the herd and infections are often associated with diarrhoea. Isospora also occurs in piglet rearing farms, at least at the beginning of the rearing period. 82 ISOSPORA SUIS IN SUCKLING PIGS - THE ROLE OF HISTOPATHOLOGY IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF FIELD OUTBREAKS.

The life-cycle follows three phases: sporogony, excystation and an endogenous phase. It is discussed whether there is also an extra-intestinal phase. The typical clinical symptoms are diarrhoea in suckling pigs in the second week of life. The diarrhoea will typically be yellow and pasty, the morbidity rate is high, whereas mortality is often low. Herd conditions and management will be very significant factors in the spread of the disease. Routes of transmission are constantly being discussed, but the most likely is pig to pig transmission via contamination of the surroundings. Strong immunity develops after infection with I. suis. The diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical symptoms and detection of oocysts or other development stages, either by means of a modified McMaster flotation technique, or by microscopic examination of a smear from the mucous membrane of the intestine. There are no highly suitable therapeutic agents or coccidiostatics on the market at present, which is why it is important to institute thorough hygiene measures. Sulpha preparations are used prophylactically by injecting the suckling pigs several times during the first week of life. A new product, toltrazuril (Baycox\u00ae 5% suspension), is under development. Toltrazuril has been shown to be especially effective in preventing coccidiosis in suckling pigs after a single oral dose of 20 mg/kg bodyweight. Introduction Diarrhoea in suckling piglets is a common disease in pig production in Denmark'. In particular, diarrhoea in the piglets' 2nd week of life does often occur. Most of these cases of diarrhoea are caused by the coccidia species Isospora suis. Thus Isospora suis was diagnosed in 20% of the faecal- or organ samples sent to the National Veterinary Laboratory in 1993 for parasitological examination. Coccidiosis in suckling pigs is also reported from abroad to a constantly increasing degree. This literature review updates the knowledge about Isospora suis: prevalence, life-cycle, pathogenesis, clinical symptoms, suis. Porcine neonatal coccidiosis. 103 Coccidia in pigs In all, identification of 13 species of Eimeria and 3 species Isospora2 has been reported in pigs. Many of these species are only known as the finding of oocysts in faeces, and some of these are probably not independent species. Some of the species found are thought to be only occasionally passing through the intestine 3. Only Isospora suis is considered to cause a pathological problem in pigs, although Eimeria species, in rare cases, can cause mild transient diarrhoea2. Isospora suis has been shown to cause the same clinical picture in wild boars 4 and miniature .5 swine Prevalence Nordic countries In a joint Scandinavian project concerning parasitic infections in pigs , several different Eimeria species as well as Isospora suis were detected. The Eimeria species were not determined. In the prevalence study there was found a great variation in the different Nordic countries (Fig. 1). The largest prevalence was observed in Iceland, while in Norway and Finland there was a very low occurrence of coccidia. The occurrence in Denmark and Sweden was more or less on the same level. One have to note that in Fig. 1 no differentiation is made between Isospora suis and Eimeria species. In 71% of the positive samples, identification of the species was successful (Fig. 2). Here, Isospora suis was confirmed in: 96% of the the weaners, of the prefatteners and in 40% of the fatteners respectively. 97% of the identified samples from the adult breeding animals were Eimeria spp. Isospora suis was only diagnosed in 3 pregnant sows and in 4 lactating sows, all from Iceland.

Prevalence of Eimeria spp. and Isospora suis oocyst-count positive pigs herds)6. Isospora suis. Porcine neonatal coccidiosis. study6, the occurrence Isospora suis correlated strongly with the size of the herd. Only 6.9% of the found positive samples from piglets were from herds with less than 50 sows, 21.5% from herds with 50\u00ad99 sows, and 34.3% from herds with more than 100 sows. The occurrence of Eimeria species from the breeding animals was positively correlated with access to outdoor sties. In Denmark it was also found that a high Isospora prevalence correlated strongly with a low weaning age, which may be explained by a rapid turnover of susceptible piglets in the farrowing pens. In addition, it was found that the SPF/MS system (declared Specific Pathogen Free) correlated with a low prevalence. In addition, in intensively farmed herds, coccidiosis is said to occur far more frequently in herds where the farrowing pens have solid or partially solid floors7. The results from the joint Nordic study correspond to other prevalence studies. In 1993, Nielsson et al.8 examined faecal samples from 34 Swedish sow herds. In the samples from the sows, they found that, Eimeria spp. were detected in 38.2% of the herds (17.9% of the sows examined), but Isospora suis was not detected in any of the herds. In the samples from the suckling piglets (1\u00ad4 weeks old), I. suis was detected in 25% of the herds, where there were problems with steatorrhoea (13% of the litters examined), and in 12.5% of the herds where no diarrhoea problems were recorded (8.3% of the litters examined). In another study8, Nielsson et al. detected oocysts in faeces from one lactating sow. However, the piglets of this sow were all negative for I. suis. o c D Eimeria spp. % Isospora suis % jS*ar^*ttT\u00cc1r\\/* BA* weaners, SF = small fatteners, LF = large fatteners BA = breeding animals (7 sows pos. for /. suis, all from Island) Fig. 2.

Apart from the Scandinavian countries, particularly USA and Canada10,1 ' are aware of the problems that Isospora suis can cause. From other overseas countries, /. suis has been described in Australia12 'l3, l4, Brazil'3, Venezuela16 and China17. From the other countries in Europe, there have been only a few reports of the occurrence of coccidiosis in piglets, from, among others, is Czechoslovakia and Switzerland 19 Seasonal variation Robinson and Morin\" showed in 1982. that coccidiosis was a problem throughout the year, but that there were clear seasonal variations. The highest prevalence was found in July - September. This seasonal variation was not demonstrated in studies from Denmark\" and in Australia14. Life-cycle Coccidia are protozoa, which are all obligatory parasites2. The classic coccidia belong to the family of Eimeriidae; this includes the genera Eimeria and Isospora. With just a few exceptions, they are parasites in the gastrointestinal tract. So far, 248 species of Isospora have been described\" . The typical life-cycle excreted with faeces, and sporulation to the infective stage takes place outside the host (see 111. 2). The sporulation is dependent on humidity, temperature and oxygen. The sporulation of Isospora suis oocysts is apparently inhibited by temperatures >40\u00b0C or <20\u00b0C. At optimum temperatures (30- 37\u00b0C), sporulation can take place in less than 16 hours8. When the / suis oocyst is sporulated, it contains two sporocysts, each with four sporozoites. This is different from the Eimeria species, where the sporulated oocysts contain four sporocysts, each with two sporozoites2-4 in which sporozoites are released from the sporocyst/oocyst. The release of sporocysts from the oocyst takes place with assistance from the gastric acid and in the presence of CO2\" . Bile and pancreatic enzymes in the small intestine activate the sporozoites, which become mobile and cause the sporoblast/oocyst to burst. The sporozoites penetrate the villous epithelium, normally in the outermost 1/3 of the villi. The greatest concentration is seen in the middle part of the jejunum, but the ileum is also infected. In severe infections the colon can also be involved22. Endogenous development The endogenous development can be seen from 111. 2. In the cells of the intestinal epithelium, the meronts are formed by asexual reproduction, and a number of merozoites are produced. With the release of the merozoites, the cells of the intestinal epithelium are destroyed. The merozoites now invade new intestinal cells, and the asexual reproduction is repeated. According to Tubbs 198622, the process involves 3 asexual reproductions, whereas others believe that the number of asexual reproductions can vary21. The last asexual stage begins to form the sexual stages in the life-cycle, the macrogametes (female) and the microgametes (male). The microgamete fertilises the macrogamete, and the hereby produced zygote develops cell walls and becomes an oocyst. The oocyst is released into the lumen of the intestine, and is shed with-faeces. The pre-patent period fot Isospora suis is 5-7:days arid the patent to 16 days23. Sporulated of Isospora species in dogs and cats, extra-intestinal stages occur in the tissue of the host. Instead of going through the normal life-cycle in the intestinal tract, some sporozoites and merozoites leave the intestine and invade extra-intestinal sites in the host. The mesenteric lymph nodes are most frequently infected, but other organs can also be involved. Whether such extra-intestinal stages occur with /. suis in pigs has not yet been clarified 22. Henriksen et al.24 showed in 1992, that piglets infected with low doses of I. suis oocysts (100 oocysts) shed oocysts in a cyclical pattern with a periodicity of 5 days. Up to three periods were documented, separated by sub-patent periods. This discovery supports the hypothesis of extra\u00ad intestinal stages for Isospora suis. Clinical symptoms Clinical coccidiosis is seen most frequently in 5-14 days old piglets, but can occur in piglets up to 21 days old . The piglets develop diarrhoea, which initially is pasty, then becomes more liquid. The faeces are typically yellow and greasy/creamy, but can vary to brownish/greyish and be slightly frothy or watery. Typically, in the same herd there will be piglets with diarrhoea as well as piglets with normal faeces. From several places a typical picture has been described, where some piglets in the infected herd are constipated, with excretion of dry, pellet-like faeces (\"sheep pellet faeces\") be pathognomic for neonatal coccidiosis. The diarrhoea lasts from a few days up to 5-6 days. In occasional cases the diarrhoea can last until weaning. The majority of affected piglets will continue to suckle, but become thin and possibly dehydrated. The morbidity is high, but the mortality is low to moderate. In a survey among Danish pig veterinary surgeons carried out in the spring of 19907, it was judged that slightly more than half of the litters in a herd typically were affected, and that, on average, slightly less than half of the piglets in affected litters developed diarrhoea. However, a significant variation from one herd to another were seen. In the same survey, the disease was judged to have only a slight influence on mortality, but to reduce growth by 15% on average. Pathogenesis The piglets become infected by absorbing sporulated oocysts. Route of transmission It is extremely rare for Isospora suis oocysts to be detected in the faeces of sows ' ' ' . One example from a study from USA9: From herds with a known history of Isospora coccidiosis in the piglets, no sows were found to be positive for suis; in herds without clinical coccidiosis, /. suis was isolated from one out of 249 sows. It must therefore be assumed that the piglets absorb oocysts that are present in the farrowing pen from the previous litter, or are brought in by the stall personnel, etc. Infected piglets shed 10-100 thousand oocysts per gram of faeces, and since coccidia oocysts are very resistant to disinfectants, it is difficult to take precautions against the transfer of coccidiaoocysts from one litter to the next. Isospora suis. Porcine neonatal coccidiosis. 108 The significance of the infective dose The degree of clinical coccidiosis is to some degree dependent on the number of oocysts absorbed21' 22, . Christensen and Henriksen investigated in 1994 which impact the infective dose of oocysts had on the clinical outbreak of coccidiosis in piglets23. With the infective doses of 3,000 to 50,000 oocysts, clear clinical symptoms were seen from 5-7 days after infection. 8 out of 32 infected piglets died or were destroyed on account of severe clinical symptoms of coccidiosis. The shedding of oocysts from the infected piglets followed a cyclic pattern with 2 sequences with an interval of approx. 5 days. Between the periods, very low-grade oocyst shedding was observed. The greatest shedding of oocysts was found 6-8 days after infection. However, an infective dose as low as 100 sporulated oocysts also caused clear shedding of oocysts and clinical manifestation of coccidiosis, although the highest oocyst shedding here was only recorded in the 2nd cycle 11-13 days after infection. In this group, a clear 3rd cycle was seen, with manifest peaks in the shedding of oocysts 16-19 days after infection. Interactions with other pathogens Interactions between neonatal coccidiosis and other pathogens have been studied. Vitovec et al. studied the interaction between Isospora suis and rotavirus. 1-2 day-old piglets were experimentally infected orally with Isospora suis or rotavirus, either individually or with both agents, simultaneously or consecutively. After infection with I. suis alone, there was the typical picture with diarrhoea and biphasic shedding of oocysts. The changes in the intestine and the clinical symptoms were more severe after rotavirus infection alone than after I. suis infection alone. Synergistic effects of simultaneous infection with/, suis and rotavirus were manifest both clinically and pathologically, with watery, slightly yellowish diarrhoea and increased mortality as the result. In 1993, Driesen et al. studied the occurrence of I. suis, rotavirus and E. coli in faeces from 1054 piglets with diarrhoea. The piglets were 5-30 days old, and came from 151 different herds in Australia. More than 90% of the cases of diarrhoea were in the age group of 6-15-day old piglets. In 35.8% of the samples I. suis was found alone, in 10.7% /. suis was found together with E. coli, in 6.7% / suis was found together with rotavirus, and in 0.6% of the samples I suis was found together with both rotavirus and E. coli. Rotavirus and E. coli were found alone or together in 8.6%, 5.9% and 1.0% of the samples respectively. The study showed that by far the most frequent cause of diarrhoea in this age group was neonatal coccidiosis, and that mixed infections with E. coli and rotavirus were frequently seen. Isospora suis. Porcine neonatal coccidiosis. changes On necropsy examination of piglets with coccidiosis, often only minor changes in the intestine are seen macroscopically 6'9'10, m\u00b721\u00b728. In severe clinical cases a green/grey, covering the mucous membranes in the jejunum and ileum is seen. The mostly are seen. /. suis coccidia in different stages of development can be found in the cells of the intestinal epithelium in affected villi ' * ' ' . Immunity In general, infections with most species of coccidia will provide lifelong immunity29. This is also true for Isospora suis. Experiments have revealed a strong acquired resistance to re-infections . Age-related resistance to / suis has also been described : The piglets were infected experimentally with I. suis. Piglets that were 2-4 weeks old at the time of infection had less pronounced signs of the disease than piglets that were 2-3 days old. Attempts have been made to try to immunise the piglets via colostrum from the sows. Clinical trials32, in which sows late in pregnancy were fed faeces from piglets suffering from diarrhoea have indicated that such an autogenic vaccination can reduce the occurrence of diarrhoea in the offspring. This was especially true in herds in which neonatal coccidiosis was a problem. However, later controlled studies33 have showed, that it was impossible to transmit passive immunity to Isospora suis from the sows to the offspring. The piglets in the trial groups shed just as many oocysts as the piglets in the control groups. The type of immunity to coccidia [Eimeria species] is an intestinal immunity. It is very complex, and still only partly understood . The mechanism of immunity to Isospora suis has not so far been studied in depth. Diagnosis The diagnosis of Isospora suis-related diarrhoea in piglets is based on the history of the herd, clinical findings, necropsy examination findings and detection of I. suis development stages in the epithelium of the small intestine and/or the finding of I. suis oocysts in faeces 2'4'6'9'l8, '\"22' ' - In the acute phase of neonatal coccidiosis in a litter, it is not possible to detect oocysts in the faeces23,26. When the clinical symptoms of coccidiosis first appear, the I. suis oocysts still have to be developed. In these cases the diagnosis must be based on the finding of different development stages of I. suis in a smear from the small intestine or histopathological findings. A little later in the course of coccidioses, or where one is trying to make a diagnosis of the herd, faecal samples are valuable tools25,35. Here, it is important to remember that the shedding of oocysts varies greatly from one individual to another, and that shedding is intermittent in the individual piglet. Isospora suis. Porcine neonatal coccidiosis. 110 Henriksen et al.35 has drawn attention to the importance of the procedure when collecting faecal samples for examination for the presence of oocysts, and they have shown that the used examination method has great influence on the result36. The following procedure should be followed: I. Faecal samples must be taken from piglets aged 10-14 days, preferably from animals with diarrhoea. In a study from 1986-1998 carried out at the National Veterinary Serum Laboratory, Copenhagen20, 5398 faecal samples (primarily from animals with diarrhoea) were examined for coccidia. In the age group 8-14 days, 33.4% were positive. Lindsay (1989)25 mentions that samples from piglets with pasty faeces are more likely to contain large amounts of oocysts, compared with more watery faeces. 2. The samples must be taken from at least 3-5 litters, from 3-5 pigs in each litter. The samples from the same litter can be collectedas one pooled sample. In the above-mentioned Danish study, a relatively marked correlation was found between the amount of samples investigated from a specific herd and the detection of coccidiosis in the herd. When 1-2 samples per herd were investigated, 32.3% of the herds were found to be infected with Isospora suis, with 3-5 samples per herd, 68.7% of the herds were positive, with 6-10 samples, 75.7% were positive, and when >10 faecal samples were investigated simultaneously, 90.2% of the herd was found to be infected with Isospora suis. This is consistent with Lindsay's observations . He mentions that it is best to collect faecal samples from 10 litters where diarrhoea has been observed for 2-3 days. 3. The examination of faecal samples must take place with a flotation test according to a modified McMaster technique. Henriksen et al.36 have shown for the Isospora suis oocysts' that, the ability to float, and the visual appearance in the microscope, depends on the flotation medium used. By comparing examining of the same faecal samples with the McMaster technique with a saturated NaCl solution (solution A) as the flotation medium, and the same NaCl solution with 500 g glucose per 1000 ml added (solution B), there was a marked difference: where solution was used, the found OPG (oocysts per gram of faeces) values were 6-7 times higher than in group where solution A was used, and the oocysts appeared much more clearly. 4. If the litters are clinically affected, the shedding of oocysts will often be of the order of magnitude 104-I05 OPG (oocysts per gram of faeces). However, there individual variation. Isospora suis. Porcine neonatal coccidiosis. Ill Prophylaxis and control Hygiene measures The best way of preventing coccidiosis in suckling pigs is by reducing the number of oocysts in the farrowing pen before each farrowing. The oocysts are sensitive to heat (>70\u00b0C)2, but apart from that they are very resistant to external influences. Tubbs (1987) states, that the sow should be washed with a mild disinfectant, and that the farrowing pen must be thoroughly cleaned mechanically, and disinfected, before each farrowing. The majority of general disinfectants are ineffective against oocysts. Chlorine or ammonia in a 50% solution is said to be the most effective . Cleaning with steam, high-pressure cleaning with warm water and direct heating with gas burners are also said to be effective. Thorough limewashing with a solution of slaked lime can replace the burning38. When the sow is installed in the farrowing pen, measures should be taken to reduce the risk of infection of the piglets: all faecal material should be removed daily, and care should be taken to prevent oocyst-containing faeces introduced from other pens. Coccidiostatics and therapy Since the primary source of infection is primarily piglets in the farrowing pens, it is pointless to treat the sows prophylactically against the shedding of oocysts. Several studies have been carried out in which the suckling pigs were treated prophylactically with various coccidiostatics. Dor\u00e9 and Morin39 from Canada have tested the active ingredient monensin in piglets which at 3 days of age were infected experimentally with 50,000 sporulated oocysts of Isospora suis. The piglets were given monensin orally every other day in a dose of 15 mg/kg from 3 days of age. No difference with regard to clinical symptoms was found between the treated and untreated litters, and the treated piglets shed considerably more oocysts than untreated animals. The conclusion was that piglets should not be treated with monensin in order to prevent Isospora suis coccidiosis. Corresponding tests have been carried out with amprolium and furazolidone40. These coccidiostatics were given to piglets experimentally infected with Isospora suis oocysts as described above. Amprolium 9.6 % was given orally in a dose of 2 ml/piglet/day, starting on the day of infection. Furazolidone was given orally in a dose of 1 ml/piglet/day for 3 days from the day of infection, and thereafter 1 ml orally every other day for 6 days. All the treated piglets showed symptoms as in coccidiosis. A slight reduction in oocyst shedding was seen in piglets that were treated with amprolium; this was not observed in the group treated with furazolidone. Tests with halofuginone and lasalocid41, two coccidiostatics that are used in poultry feed, showed discouraging results. Newer coccidiostatics have also been tested for the prevention of Isospora suis coccidiosis in suckling pigs. Decox\u00ae(declazuril)42 given orally to the pigs (100 mg/kg b.w.) on the 3rd, 5th and Isospora suis. Porcine neonatal coccidiosis. 112 7th days of life, resulted in significantly better growth (days 3-21), lower mortality, and markedly lower oocyst shedding in treated pigs, compared with the placebo-group. Sulpha preparations have an effect on coccidia. They are used prophylactically by being injected several times within the piglet's first week of life. In Denmark, several sulpha preparations are registered for prophylactic treatment against coccidiosis. All the above-mentioned coccidia agents have either shown discouraging results in clinical trials, or are too time-consuming for use in practice. There is therefore a great need for more suitable products for the prevention of coccidiosis in suckling pigs. A relatively new coccidia agent, toltrazuril (Baycox ), has been developed by Bayer AG for the treatment of coccidiosis in poultry43. Toltrazuril has proved to be extremely effective against a wide range of Eimeria and Isospora species, without influencing the development of immunity44, 45. Tests of toltrazuril as a preventive agent against neonatal coccidiosis caused by Isospora suis have shown that one oral treatment with 20 mg toltrazuril (Baycox 5% suspension) per kg bodyweight to 3-5 day-old piglets gives extremely satisfactory results 16,18,46,47,48,49,50. Baycox in a 5% oral suspension is expected to be registered for pigs within the next few years. Literature 1 \u00c5rsberetning fra S VS 1993. 2 Lindsay DS, Todd KS Jr.: Parasitic Protozoa.

Fuchs, S. Sonda, A. Switzerland. Neospora caninum is a coccidian parasite of considerable economic importance by causing abortion or stillbirth in cattle among other disorders in different animal species. We recently established an experimental mouse infection model which showed that wild type C57BL/6 mice injected i.p. with 105 living N. caninum tachyzoites were all N. caninum-posi\u00efwe in their brain as tested by PCR analysis (at day 44 p.L). The present study included a vaccination trial to assess the putative protection by recombinant (ree) proteins from N. caninum against subsequent N. caninum challenge infection. The rec\u00adproteins (Nc\u00adp36, Nc\u00adp43 and a mix of both) to be injected into mice were emulsified with the RIB! Adjuvant System (RAS) at 50 pg/ml, a crude extract of N. caninum (NC) was emulsified at a concentration of 250 pg/ml. Groups of wt C57BL/6 mice were inoculated i.p. with 200 of either RAS, rec\u00adNc\u00adp36, rec\u00adNc\u00adp43, the mix of rec\u00adproteins or crude extract. A booster injection was repeated 14 days later. At this stage, parasite\u00adspecific IgG production in sera was con\u00ad firmed by ELISA using NC crude antigen. Antibody concentrations were much higher in mice injected with either rec\u00adNc\u00adp43 or crude extract than in mice injected with either Nc\u00adp36 or the rec\u00adprotein mix. Seven days after booster injection, mice were infected with 2 105 . caninum tachyzoites and euthanised 15 d.p.L Blood was collected for antibody determination and brain, heart, liver and kidney for PCR\u00adbased N. caninum-DNA detection. All organs were PCR\u00adnegative in uninfected control groups. In infected control groups, 3/6 mice were positive in the brain and 1/6 in the liver. Mice injected with rec\u00adNc\u00adp43 or crude extract before infection showed interesting results in that all organs were N. caninum-negaWve by PCR. Conversely, the brain of 2/3 mice injected with rec\u00adNcp36 and the brain of 2/3 mice injected with the rec\u00adprotein mix was N. caninum- positive, as well as the brains of non\u00adimmunized but /eospora\u00adinfected control animals. These results suggest that vaccination with either ree Nc\u00adp43 or N. caninum crude extract may induce protective immunity against subsequent N. caninum infection. A second vaccination trial is currently performed to elucidate the significance of our primary data. 123 Use of recombinant SAG1 in a subunit vaccine against infection with Toxoplasma gondii in mice H. Vedel-Nielsen, L Christiensen and of Parasitology, Statens Seruminstitut, Artillerivej 5. DK-2300 Copenhagen, Denmark. It has been difficult to develop effective recombinant vaccines against protozoan infections. So far the most effective vaccine against infection with Toxoplasma gondii is a live, attenuated vaccine used in sheep. We have expressed the T. gondii surface antigen 1 (SAG1) in Escherichia coli and shown that antibodies induced by rSAG recognise native T. gondii. In another study, we found that mice immunised with rSAG1 in alum, induced partial protective immunity against infection with the lethal RH-strain, measured as an prolonged survival time. We have further developed the plasmid coding for the rSAGl into DNA vaccine, and will present data showing that mice immunised with the plasmid coding for the SAG1 induce antibodies which recognise native SAG1. Immunity against T. gondii is believed to be at least partially stage specific. We are in the process of developing an experimental vaccine containing both the SAG1 and the bradyzoite antigen 1 (SAG1), a bradyzoite specific antigen belonging to the HSP family. We hope that by using stage specific antigen we will be able to reduce the number of cysts after infection with a cyst forming strain. 124 3\u00b7 The growing family of SAGl-related antigens of Toxoplasma gondii: Molecular characterization and expression analysis of the SAG5 gene cluster E Spano1. I. Ricci1, M. Di Cristina1, C. Puri2, L. Putignani1 and A. Crisanti1\u00b73 1 Istituto di Parassitologia e 2 Istituto di Istologia e Embriologia Generale, Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"La Sapienza\", Rome, Italy; 3 Imperiai College, Department of Biology, London, UK. The invasive stages of the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii are known to express a set of surface antigens, known as the SAG proteins, sharing structural and functional characteristics. Besides the extensively characterized SAG1 (p30) and SAG3 (p43) a series of novel OOnd/'/'proteins sharing close structural similarity with SAG1 and SAG3 have been recently identified: SRS1-4 and BSR4 by Boothroyd and co-workers and SAG5 in our laboratory. A portion of the SAG5 gene was accidentally amplified from the genomic DNA of T. gondii (RH strain) employing unrelated primers. The PCR product 12G/16, encoding a 212 amino acid-long polypeptide showing a significant homology to both SAG1 and SAG3, was used as a probe to screen a genomic T. gondii cosmid library. Southern blot analysis of the positive cosmidic clones and of T. gondii genomic DNA employing the 12G/16 fragment as a probe yielded complex hybridization patterns, suggesting the existence, in the genome of gondii, of a family of related genes. Extensive sequence analysis confirmed this hypothesis and revealed the presence of three tightly clustered genes encoding closely related proteins, denominated SAG5.1, SAG5.2 and SAG5.3. All three polypeptides show the hallmarks of the family of SAG 1 -related molecules, being characterized by a leader peptide, 12 cysteine residues whose distribution suggests a tandem duplication of an ancestral 6-cysteine motif and a C-terminal GPI-anchoring signal. SAG5.2 and SAG5.3 are 367 amino acid-long and differ from each other at 8 amino acid positions (98% identity), while SAG5.1, which consists of 362 amino acids, is virtually identical to the other two SAG5 proteins only within the C-terminal region (positions 162-362). Notably, in the N-terminal half of the molecule the degree of amino acid identity to SAG5.2/SAG5.3 drops to approximately 40%, which represents the average homology shared by all members of the \"SAG1\" protein family. Northern blot and RT-PCR analysis of poly(A)+ RNA showed that all three SAG5 genes are expressed in tachyzoites. The transcriptional activity in the other invasive stages is understudy. The localization of the SAG5 proteins in T.gondii tachyzoites was investigated employing polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised against a recombinant histidine-tagged fragment of SAG5.3 produced in E. coli and affinity purified by nickel chelate chromatography. In contrast with the other SAG 1-related proteins, immunofluorescence analysis failed to show for SAG5 any significant staining of the tachyzoite plasmamembrane. Instead, anti-SAG5 antibodies specifically decorated the apical end of the tachyzoites. This evidence was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy experiments in which anti-SAG5 antibodies were shown to label the cytoplasmic side of the tachyzoite pellicle and electrondense structures possibly associated with the microtu- bular components of the apical complex. Despite the evident structural similarity to the other SAG 1-related molecules, the unusual genomic organization of the SAG5 genes and the peculiar subcellular localization of the encoded proteins seem to indicate for the SAG5 proteins a distinct functional role, whose elucidation deserves further investigation. 125 Molecular characterisation of the Neospora tachyzoite M\u00fcller and of Parasitology, University of Bern, Switzerland. Neospora caninum is structurally and biologically closely related to, but antigenically distinct from, Toxo\u00ad plasma gondii. These parasites are obligatory intracellular and molecules associated with the surface and with secretory organelles are likely to participate in the host cell entry process and therefore in the pathogenesis. A tachyzoite stage\u00adspecifically expressed surface protein of T.gondii \\s SAG1 (p30) which has been shown to be involved in host cell attachment and invasion. Previously we have identified a cell surface\u00adassociated glycopro\u00ad tein (Nc\u00adp36) in N.caninum tachyzoites. The full of the cDNA coding for Nc\u00adp36 was deter\u00ad mined, and analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence demonstrated that Nc\u00adp36 is closely related to SAG1. However these two proteins are antigenically distinct. Nc\u00adp36 is encoded by a single copy gene which produces a transcript of 1.4 kb. Immunogold labeling of resin\u00adembedded parasites using polyclonal antibodies affinity\u00adpurified on a recombinant Nc\u00adp36 fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli showed that this protein is located exclusively on the tachyzoite cell surface. 5. Differential expression of cell surface- and dense granule-associated Neospora caninum Gottstein L\u00e4ngass-Strasse 122, CH-3012 Berne, Switzerland tachyzoites and the tissue cysts of Neospora caninum are difficult to distinguish from those of other cyst\u00adforming apicomplexan parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii. been identified in T.gondii tachyzoites and bradyzoites, and respective antibodies are useful tools for discriminating between the two stages during tachyzoite\u00adbradyzoite interconversion upon I gondii infec\u00ad tions. While several cell surface\u00ad and dense granule\u00adassociated proteins have been identified and characterized in N. caninum tachyzoites, little is known about antigenic components expressed in N. caninum bradyzoites. In this study, we describe the differential expression of the 2 N. caninum surface proteins Nc\u00adp43 and Nc\u00adp36 and the dense granule Nc\u00adp33 (NCDG1) tachyzoites and bradyzoites of N. caninum by using protein\u00adspecific affinity purified polyclonal antibodies. Expression of the three proteins was assessed by immu\u00ad nofluorescent staining of mouse brain sections containing either tachyzoites or bradyzoites (tissue cysts) of gondii A.B.

Transfer and expression of DNA in tachyzoites of the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii was first described by Soldati and Boothroyd in 1993 (Science, 260:439\u00ad52). This tool complements several other features of gondii, such as simple in vitro culture of tachyzoites, cyst formation in culture, and well defined classical genetics, making this protozoan a paradigm forstudies on intracellular parasitism. Over the last years, transfection has come to be used routinely in many laboratories working with gondii, and conse\u00ad quently a wide array of molecular genetic manipulations have been developed on the basis of the original protocol. In this paper we present a number of examples from our lab and others to illustrate both the power of transfection in various areas of basic Toxoplasma research and the potential for engineering apicomplexan parasites to fit specific needs. Linearized or circular vector DNA containing appropriate c/s\u00adacting sequences is transfected into extra\u00ad cellular tachyzoites by electroporation. Classical markers for selection, such as antibiotic resistance genes (Kim et al., Science 1993, 262: 911\u00ad4) or \u00df\u00adGal (Seeber & Boothroyd, Gene 1996, 22: 39\u00ad45), are used for most routine applications and yield stable transgenics at a frequency of up to 1%. Mutant alleles of the enzyme DHFR\u00adTS that confer resistance to pyrimethamine increase this remarkably high frequency of transfection to about 5% (Donald & Roos, HXGPRT under the control of constitutive but also stage\u00adspecific promoter elements allows both selection for and against its expression by the drugs mycophenolic acid and 6\u00adthioxanthine, respectively. Positive/negative selection has been used to screen for mutants deficient in differentiation and in promoter\u00adtrap experiments. Most recently, the addition of GFP to the arsenal of reporters has allowed in situ observation of protein trafficking, both inside live parasites and the parasitophorous vacuole (Striepen et al., Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. The power to control homologous vs. non\u00adhomologous integration of DNA makes transfection in T.gondii an extremely useful tool: Gene knock\u00adouts by replacement insertion, which have been demonstrated for a number of genes (e.g. SAG1, ROP1, BAG1, HXGPRT), can be achieved with long contiguous genomic DNA from the target site flanking a selectable marker gene. Minimal homology regions in the transfected vector, on the other hand, lead to essentially random integration of linear tags or promoter\u00adless reporter genes throughout the genome. This makes experimental approaches such as gene trapping or insertional mutagenesis with subsequent rescue of tagged loci highly efficient in this system. A shuttle vector containing a Toxoplasma origin of replication has been developed to be maintained as an episome under selection pressure. Such vectors have been used successfully to rescue mutants by complementation and will be essential for the convenient identification of genes responsible for a defined mutant phenotype or the analysis of lethal gene knock\u00adouts. Sophisticated transfection techniques enable us to use T. gondii also as a model system to study the biological function of phylogenetically conserved proteins from related apicomplexans (e.g. AMA1 from Plas\u00ad modia) which are less easily manipulated. Neospora caninum, which is closely related to T.gondiibui antigeni\u00ad cally distinct, is now also amenable to transfection. N. caninum provides a convenient background to express and investigate selected surface antigens and organeilar proteins from T gondii without the need to introduce tags for detection. Efficient transfection protocols and the powerful selections that have been devised in this model parasite have expanded the realm of experimental possibilities greatly. As we learn more about the biological function of specific proteins and antigens in T. gondii and other apicomplexans, we have not only a ready tool to test our hypothesis but also the ability to tailor parasites to fit many of our experimental needs. 127 7. Identification of a novel surface protein of Toxoplasma gondii using RNA display J. G. Mattsson1. E. Ljunggren1, K. Bergstr\u00f6m1 and D. Soldati2 1Department Sweden; 2ZMBH, University of Heidelberg, INF 282, DE-69 120 Heidelberg, Germany. A recently described mutant of the RH-strain of Toxoplasma gondii resistant to high doses of artemisinin has been shown to have lost its acute virulence. In order to investigate the genetic background to the observed phenotypes we have used an m RNA display strategy to compare expression changes between tachyzoites from the mutant and the parental RH-strain. Through this analysis we have isolated several short cDNA tags corresponding to genes whose expression has been modified in the mutant in comparison with the RH-strain. Northern blot analysis for one of these, RAP6, showed that it hybridised to 1.8 kb long mRNA whose expres\u00ad sion has been significantly down regulated in the mutant. We then used an inverse PCR to obtain sequences outside the original RAP6 fragment. The extended sequence matched two clones from the expressed se\u00ad quence tag (EST) dataset of T.gondii. The complete cDNA sequences from these two clones were determined and combined with the genomic sequences. The open reading frame of about 368 amino acids was shown to match a surface antigen from merozoites of Sarcocystis muris. The open reading frame also encode a hypo\u00ad thetical N-terminal signal peptide sequence and a number of residues, reminiscent of the SAG-family of T.gondii. Using transfection techniques work is now on the way to further characterise the role of the RAP 6 polypeptide. 8. Expression of the bradyzoite-specific surface antigen SAG4 in the Ts-4 vaccine strain of Toxoplasma gondii Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, Germany. During infection with Toxoplasma gondii, the acute phase caused by the virulent stage tachyzoite is rapidly overcome by the onset of the immune response. Parasites develop into a chronic phase characterized by formation of cysts which persist during the life span of the host. In immunocompromized patients the re\u00ad lapse of the cyst form is responsible for the pathogenesis of the disease. The temperature-sensitive mutant ts-4 of the T gondii RH strain fails to grow at 40 degrees C in vitro. This attenuated mutant which has been widely used to vaccinate mice against virulent T gondii strains, elicits strong preimmune defenses, dependent on gamma interferon, which are needed by mice to survive acute infection. Although this experimental vaccine protects animals from disease it does not prevent from infection and cyst formation. Information regarding the role of bradyzoite-specific antigens in immune protection is limited to date. To investigate the potential protective properties of the bradyzoite-specific surface antigen SAG4(P18), we have generated a recombinant ts-4 mutant expressing this surface protein in a constitutive fashion (ts-4/SAG4). In parallel we have produced and purified recombinant SAG4 protein from E. coli. Different combination of ts-4, ts-4/SAG4 and/or recombinant SAG4 protein have been used to immunize mice. Preliminary analyses show that the experimental vaccination elicits a strong antibody response and CTL proliferation against SAG4. The vaccinated mice will be challenged to other-wise lethal doses of cysts from the persistent Prugniaud strain to evaluate effectiveness of the SAG-4 based vaccines against chronic infection . 128 knockout and wild-type mouse model for immunological studies in experimental neosporosis B. Gottstein. A.Hemphill and S. 122, CH-3001 Switzerland. veterinary pathogen as causative agent of neuromuscular disorders and abortion in different animals, especially cattle as tested in one of our studies (Gottstein et al., 1998, Int. J. Parasitol., 28,679\u00ad691). We now established an experimental murine model for the study of host immunity. Thus, wild type C57BL/6 mice and B\u00adcell deficient mice (transgenic mutation in the transmembrane exon of the IgM \u00adchain gene; \u00admice) were infected i.p. with 105 living N. caninum tachyzoites. Mice were sacrificed at days 10,24 and 29\u00ad44 pi. Brain, heart, lung, liver, spleen, and kidney were collected for parasito\u00ad logicai and pathological, spleen and serum for in vitro-sWmu- lated with N. caninum- and T. gontf/Aantigens for assessing cell proliferation and cytokine production. While wt mice were resistant to disease, mice died between days 29 \u00ad 44 pi. Histological examination of brain tissue from mice exhibited a high infection intensity with multifocal necrotic cerebral lesions, absent in brain of wt mice. Neospora antigen\u00adstimulated splenocytes of both wt and mice infected with N. caninum showed a marked proliferative depression at day 10 pi. At day 24 pi, this immunosuppression was still main\u00ad tained in mice whereas full immune responsiveness had been restored in wt mice. Stimulated splenocytes of infected mice secreted less IFN\u00adyand less IL\u00ad10 than corresponding wt splenocytes. For IL\u00ad10, these differences markedly increased between days 10 and 24 pi. Consequently, the high susceptibility of mice appeared causatively associated to an impaired cellular response in addition to the humoral deficiency, finally resulting in a lethal outcome of infection. 129 IO. Protozoal infections associated with abortion in italian livestock G. Pi Francesco. A.R. D'Angelo, A. role played by cyst-forming coccidian parasites in determining abortions, has been recently recognised in many part of the world. To assess the importance of foetal protozoan abortions in Italian livestock industry, 127 bovine, ovine and caprine foetuses, in which no bacteria, viruses or others have been isolated, were examined. From each foetus, sections of heart, liver, brain and kidney have been fixed and processed for histology and immunohistochemistry. According to the histological findings, 45.9% (17 out of 37) of the bovine foetuses had protozoon-like cysts, 37.5% (3/8) of goat foetuses were also found whereas in only 14.6% (12/82) of ovine foetuses, cysts were present. Heart was the organ most commonly involved by the presence of the cysts. Histological lesions, characterised by non suppurative inflammation, were observed in 83.4% of foetuses and the liver was the organ most commonly involved. Immunohisto-chemical studies using antisera against Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii, showed neydiife reactions also in those samples in which only histo\u00ad logical lesions were observed. II. The epidemiology and significance of bovine neosporosis in England and Wales: interim results of a Veterinary Science, University of Liverpool; 'Veterinary Investigation Centre, Carmarthen, U.K. In a project supported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, United Kingdom, and involving collaboration with the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, veterinary practitioners and dairy farmers, we are seek\u00ad ing to determine the significance of bovine neosporosis in England and Wales and to elucidate its epidemiol\u00ad ogy. Herd-and age-specific antibody prevalence data have been obtained from over 4,000 cattle in 16 herds by ELISA. Logistic regression analysis showed no difference between prevalence values in different age groups, consistent with vertical transmission being the major mode of transmission. On-farm studies of new-born calves sampled pre-colostrally have confirmed the extremely high efficiency of vertical transmission. In a randomised, case-control serological survey of aborting (n = 626) and normally calving (n = 416) cows, abort\u00ad ing cattle were three times more likely to be Neospora antibody positive than non-aborting cows (p <0.0001 ) but the antibody prevalences to BVD virus, IBR virus and Leptospira hardjo were not higher in the aborting group. The antibody prevalence in normally calving cows was 5.7% (95% CI; 4,8). This is the first estimate of N. caninum seroprevalence using a random sample of dairy cattle in England and Wales, and these data provide a basis to estimate some economic costs associated with this infection. 130 11. Seroprevalence of Neospora caninum infection in dairy and beef 24007-Le\u00f3n, Spain 2Dpto Sanidad Animal, Veterinary Faculty, University of Madrid, 28040-Madrid, Spain 3Moredun Research Institute, International Research Centre, Pentland Science Park, Bush Loan, Penicuik, EH26 OPZ, Edinburgh, UK In recent years, neosporosis has been identified as a major cause of abortion in dairy and beef cattle. Although the disease has been described worl\u00adwide there is a lack of information concerning the prevalence of this disease in different cattle production systems. The aim of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence of Neospora caninum infection in a represen\u00ad tative area of beef and dairy cattle production in Spain. A cattle census provided by the Local Veterinary Service in 1996 showed an average population of 11,460 cattle distributed over 749 herds (498 beef and 251 dairy herds). Cluster sampling was employed, in which herds constituted the initial sampling unit and two strata (dairy and beef herds) were considered. As there is little information concerning the prevalence of neosporosis in the different cattle producing systems the worst case was considered (50% prevalence). Using a 95% level of confidence and setting 5% (beef) and 5.4% (dairy) error limits, the desired sample size were 216 and 143 for beef and dairy herds, respectively. This sample size was distributed according to the proportional cattle herd number of the different municipalities in the area. Cattle herds were randomly selected using random number tables and contacted by the local Veterinary Service. On the basis of the formula n=[1\u00ad(1\u00adCL)1/D][N\u00ad(D\u00ad1)/2], where n is the required sample size, CL is the confidence level (95%), D is the supposed number of infected cattle in each herd (23.4%) (Quintanilla\u00ad G\u00f3zalo et al., 1996. IV Cong. Int. ANEMBE), and N is the herd size, nine animals (>1 year old) were randomly sampled in each herd to detect the presence of the infection. A herd was considered infected when at least one animal was seropositive. Sample sizes required to detect infection and estimate herd prevalence were calculated using the EPISCOPE computer program (Frankena et al., Vet. Ree, 126:573\u00ad576). In total, serum samples from 1121 dairy and 1712 beef animals were collected and tested for specific an\u00fc-N.caninum IgG using an ELISA test. Serum samples with optical densities equal to or higher than 0.40 were considered as positive (OSAWA et al., Vet. Parasitol. in press). Specific antibodies were detected in 55.1% (119/216) beef and 83.2% (119/143) dairy herds. Individual 17.9% (306/1712) for beef and 35.9% (402/1121 ) for dairy animals. Presence of N. caninum infection was higher in dairy than in beef herds and the association between infection and the cattle production system (dairy or beef) was statistically significant [2=29.21, p<0.001, OR=4.04 (2.35\u00ad6.99)]. Data concerning association with other epidemiological parameters such as herd size, herd management and herd location will be presented and discussed. This is the first estimate of N. caninum seroprevalence in dairy and beef cattle herds in Spain using a random and representative sample. Preliminary data show the widespread distribution of N. caninum infection and the influence of the production systems on the risk of acquiring this infection. This study may be of value to estimate the general prevalence of this disease in dairy and beef cattle in Spain and to calculate its economic repercussions. 131 ?\u00bb. Genetic polymorphism in laboratory isolates of Neospora caninum .Wastling1 A. Schock2 , E. A. Innes2 and I. Yamane3 division of Infection & Immunity, Institute of Biomedical & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom. G12 8QQ; 2Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh, United Kingdom; 3National Insitute of Health, Laboratory of Epidemiology, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan. The design of effective control measures against parasitic infections depends on a good under\u00ad standing of the epidemiology of the parasite in question. Without this knowledge changes in management practice, vaccination or therapeutic intervention may make little impression on the economic impact of parasitic disease. Genetic typing which exploits DNA polymorphisms between different isolates of the same species is a valuable tool in determining the epidemiology of pathogenic microorganisms. Suitable genetic markers may be generated by a variety of techniques often depending on the extent to which genetic variation occurs within the target population. To date little is known about the genetic variation that occurs between different isolates of Neospora caninum, although ribosomal RNA sequencing sug\u00ad gests that the isolates examined so far do form a single species (Marsh et al, J. Parasitology 1995, vol. 84, pp. 530\u00ad535). In this study we have examined genetic variation occurring between a variety of N. caninum laboratory isolates maintained in tissue culture using random amplified polymorphic DNA analy\u00ad sis (RAPD). The laboratory isolates analysed were from geographically distinct sites in Europe and Ja\u00ad pan. Genetic polymorphisms identified in these laboratory isolates by RAPD analysis will now be used to generate DNA markers that will be evaluated on field samples. Such markers could be used to help answer questions such as (a) how genetically diverse are N. caninum field populations? (b) are different populations of N. caninum epidemiological^ related? (c) does vertical transmission contribute to the \"clonality\" of this parasite (d) are certain isolates associated with disease i.e. are there \"virulent\" and \"avirulent\" strains of N. caninum!

Denmark. 3 National Veterinary Institute and Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Box 7073, S-750 07 Uppsala, Sweden. The dynamics of /eospora\u00adspecific serum antibodies during the life of the cow and the influence of pregnancy is still incompletely resolved. In a follow\u00adup study on 4 Danish dairy herds with confirmed neosporosis, data from Iscom\u00adELISA on 285 cows with at least 2 bleedings with > 3 mo. interval were analyzed to study changes in an up to 1Vz years period. With an assay employing an lgG,\u00adspecific conjugate (Swedish National Veterinary Institute), 49% of the animals were consistently negative, while 41% were consistenly seropositive. Apparent seroconversions (7.7%) dominated over fluctuating responses (2.5%), which was also reflected in a moderately increased seroprevalence with cow age in the studied populations. Reasonably equipotent assays for lgG1 and lgG2 were established using monoclonal mouse conjugates from the same producer (Bethyl). The data from one of the investigated herds showed large variations between individual seropositive animals for the lgG/lgG2 OD\u00adratio, ranging from 0.23 to 4.3, with a trend towards a minimum around the time of parturition. Analysis of the data from all 4 study herds will be presented and discussed. 132 15. Immunity to Neospora caninum J. Marks. I. Esteban\u00adRedondo, A. Lund\u00e9n, Tooke, T. Duggan E.A. Moredun Research Institute, International Loan, Penicuik, caninum an intracellular coccidian parasite that causes abortion and congenital defects in cattle, dogs, horses and goats. The parasite is recognised as a major cause of infectious abortion and is linked to approxi\u00ad mately 12\u00ad17% of bovine abortions in Scotland. Neospora can cause repeat abortion, but the rate of repeat abortion is estimated to be less than 5%. The only known route of natural infection is by congenital transmission. Cell mediated immune mechanisms, and in particular the cell cytokine IFNy produced mainly by CD4+ T cells, are important in the development of protective immunity to Toxoplasma gondii, a closely related coccid\u00ad ian parasite which causes abortion in sheep. Very little is known about the immune response to N. caninum, but it is likely that the production of IFNy is important in the prevention of repeat abortion. We have shown in previous studies that treatment of cells with recombinant IFNy significantly inhibits intracellular multiplication of N. caninum tachyzoites. In this study, calves experimentally inoculated with N. caninum NC1 strain tachyzoites developed a cell mediated immune response to infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) from infected cattle prolif\u00ad erated in vitro in response to Neospora whole antigen. CD4+ cell lines generated from infected animals responded to a group of Neospora antigen fractions of molecular weight 30kDa and supernatants from the activated CD4+ cells were found to contain high concentrations of IFNy. Pre\u00adtreatment of bovine fibroblasts with these supernatants inhibited the growth of N. caninum tachyzoites in vitro. These low molecular weight proteins may therefore be responsible for the induction of a potentially protective immune response. N. caninum tachyzoites were also cultured in alveolar macrophages from infected and control animals. Cells from the infected calves were able to suppress growth of the parasite in comparison to the growth of tachyzoites in cells from naive animals. A study of the immune response in congenially infected calves revealed that these animals also devel\u00ad oped a cell mediated immune response to infection. PBM from these animals proliferated in response to a crude lysate of N. caninum NC1 tachyzoites in vitro and supernatant collected from proliferating cells also contained high concentrations of IFNy. While the nature of protective immunity to N. caninum is still unknown it is clear that IFNy plays an important role in the immune response to this parasite. A further understanding of the cell mediated immune response and the mechanisms involved will have a considerable impact on how to produce a potentially pro\u00ad tective immune response. 133 16. Immunological and clinical responses in cattle following experimental infection with Neospora caninum at different stages of gestation Guv. CS., Williams, D.J.L., Guy, F, McGarry, J.W., MacEacheran, K., Smith R., Kelly, D. F. and Trees, A.J. Veterinary Parasitology, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine / Faculty of Veterinary Science, Pembroke Place, Liverpool, L3 5QA, UK. The apicomplexan protozoan parasite, Neospora caninum, is a major cause of bovine abortion in many countries. Little is known about the immune response to Neospora in naturally or experimentally infected cattle, although as Neospora is closely related to Toxoplasma gondii, cell mediated immune responses are likely to be important. The aim of this study was to investigate the immunological, clinical and pathological responses in cattle experimentally infected with N. caninum at different times relative to gestation. Cattle were divided into three groups and infected with in vitro derived Ne (Liv) tachyzoites nine weeks prior to artificial insemination, ten weeks post\u00adinsemination or thirty weeks post\u00adinsemina\u00ad tion. An increase in temperature was detected in 15/24 cattle 2\u00ad7 days after infection. Antibody levels increased and reached a peak at 4 weeks after infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells prolifer\u00ad ated in response to parasite derived antigen by 8 days after infection and this was accompanied by secretion of high levels of \u00e3 interferon. The effect of infection on the viability of the foetuses will be presented. 17. The role of immunological memory in Sarcocystis infection T. J\u00e4kel1. J. Sangchai2 and Y. Khoprasert2 division of Parasitology, Department of Zoology, University of Hohenheim, Emil Wolff Str. 34, 70599 Stuttgart, Germany; ^Agricultural Zoology Research Group, Entomology and Zoology Division, Department of Agriculture, Bangkok 10900, Thailand. A hallmark of the immune response is memory, the ability to recall an earlier encounter with specific antigen. In a recent investigation Bunce and Bell (1997, J. Exp. Med., 185: 767\u00ad776) demonstrated that two isoforms of the CD45 molecule (CD45RCVC\") define two types of CD4 memory cells in the rat. Upon antigen encounter, naive CD45RC+ CD4 cells rapidly switch to short\u00adlived CD45RC\" (memory) cells. If antigen does not persist, CD45RC\" cells can revert within a week to longer\u00adlived CD45RC+ memory cells which ensure that immunlogical memory endures. We investigated CD4 cell memory in wild brown rats infected with Sarcocystis singaporensis. The underlying question was why natural infections (presumably following uptake of low numbers of sporocysts) apparently did not protect rats against acute sarcocystosis after challenge with high sporocyst doses (J\u00e4kel et al. 1996, J. Parasitol., 82: 280\u00ad287). Rats were immunized with 10 or 1000 sporocysts or PBS (10 rats/group) 16 days prior to challenge with 5 105 sporocysts. Only animals immunized with 1000 sporocysts survived challenge. Flow cytometric analysis of spleen cells (anti\u00adCD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RC) at the day of challenge revealed that only rats immunized with 1000 sporocysts showed a significantly higher number of CD8 cells and CD45RC+ CD4 cells (compared to PBS). Additionally, the cell response clearly mirrored the cell results. In a set of repeated experiments, we used 100 sporocysts for immunization. Here, a majority of rats survived challenge. In contrast to the higher immunization dose, however, only numbers of CD45RC+ CD4 cells were significantly increased in these rats at the day of challenge. These data indicate that formation of long\u00adlived memory CD4 cells in sufficient quantity may be crucial for protective immunity of rats against acute Sarcocystis infection. Adoptive transfer experiments are under\u00ad way to further adress this question. 134 ?. Epidemiology and economic impact of toxoplasmosis in animal production P. Buxton Moredun Research Institute, Pentland Science Park, by Edinburgh, EH26 OPZ, Scotland, UK. The apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii can infect most, if not all, warm-blooded vertebrates in which it has a two-stage life cycle (bradyzoites in tissue cysts and tachyzoites). In Felidae it can undergo a sexual life cycle and produce oocysts, which can survive on pasture, in food and in water for many months and constitute a source of infection for farm animals. It has its greatest impact in sheep in which, following a primary infection during pregnancy, it may cause fetal death and abortion. It can also cause abortion in goats and pigs but no significant disease is produced in cattle and horses. Sheep. Sheep are farmed in all 15 countries of the EU and in 1997 there were over 98 million of which 70.6 million were recorded as being females of breeding age (Statistical Office of the European Commission - SOEC) of which three-quarters were located in the UK, Spain, Italy and France (1998, MLC European Handbook, 2,6-7, MLC, Milton Keynes). Toxoplasma abortion and fetal loss may occur wherever sheep are kept but precise figures of the losses do not exist. Perhaps the best estimates were made by Blewett and Trees (1987, British Veterinary Journal, 143,128-135) who concluded that the average incidence of clinical toxoplasmosis in the UK is between 1 % and 2% per annum. This figure is an underestimate, as it does not include the loss of fetuses early in gestation that are resorbed so that the ewes present as cases of infertility. If the incidence of toxoplasmosis is assumed to be similar throughout the sheep rearing areas of the EU then in 1997 between 706,000 and 1.4 million lambs would have been lost (assuming an average lambing of one lamb per ewe). However this is a risky assumption and the incidence of clinical toxoplasmosis will probably vary from region to region. Because clinical toxoplasmosis occurs following primary infection during pregnancy its incidence is influenced by a) the number of susceptible sheep and b) the degree of contamination of food and water by viable oocysts, which itself is dependent both on the cat population and environmental conditions. A lower incidence than occurs in the UK will be recorded in a region if infection, seroconversion and immunity occur in a high proportion of sheep before they reach breeding age. This may occur if a) there is significant contamination of food and/or water with oocysts and/or b) environmental conditions favour their prolonged viability (relatively little dessication and frost). A lower incidence of clinical toxoplasmosis will be encountered in a region where viable oocysts are scarce. Thus few cats, extensive grazing practices, no supplementary feeding and relatively harsher weather conditions, with significant frosts and/or dessication, will lead to low infection rates. While there will be a relatively high proportion of susceptible pregnant sheep they will be exposed to minimal chal\u00ad lenge by oocysts. Goats. The 12 million goats in the EU (SOEC) are as susceptible to toxoplasmosis as sheep and the incidence of clinical disease will be influenced in similar ways to those for sheep. Goats and sheep are also kept for milk production, particularly in Greece, France, Italy and Spain. Any cause of abortion may severely reduce herd and flock outputs. Pigs. There are an estimated 118.5 million pigs in the EU of which 12.8 million are females of breeding age (SOEC). The incidence of fetal losses due to toxoplasmosis is not known but it is likely to be less than that in sheep. However infection in pigs is relatively common (approximately 30% are seropositive)(Dubey and Beattie, 1988, Toxoplasmosis of Animals and Man, CRC, Boca Raton.) and likely to be more so in extensive outdoor management systems than in housed, minimal disease units. Toxoplasma gondii is also a zoonotic parasite that can cause serious illness in certain sections of the human population. As well as the suffering it causes there is a cost for the health services in the EU. Thus the cost of toxoplasmosis to EU (and non-EU) countries is considerable both in terms of inefficient animal produc\u00ad tion and as a human pathogen often derived from ingested, infected meat. Only with more accurate data will it be possible to direct control measures effectively. 135 . The economic impact of neosporosis ^.M. Wastling and 2E.A. Innes 1Division of Infection & Immunity, Institute of Biomedical & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ; 2Moredun Research Institute, Pentlands Science Park, EH26 OPZ, UK. Infection with Neospora caninum was first associated with bovine abortion about ten years ago and has since become recognised as an important reproductive disease of cattle with a world-wide distribution. Re\u00ad cently the dog has been identified as a definitive host for this parasite, but vertical transmission is still thought to play a major role in the epidemiology of the disease in cattle. Just how important the disease is to the European economy has yet to be rigorously addressed, but this question requires urgent attention if appropri\u00ad ate resources are to be allocated to minimise its impact. Recent advances in the diagnosis of infection, including serological tests (ELISA and IFAT), immunohistochemistry and PCR now provide the potential for more reliable diagnosis and hence quantification of the impact of neosporosis. Nevertheless, the implementation of appropriate standardised diagnostic procedures is probably still the single biggest obstacle in obtaining reliable estimates of the cost of this disease to the European farming industry. Some estimates of the economic cost of the disease have appeared in the literature, for example, the cost to the Californian dairy farming industry is thought to be approximately US$ 34.5 m each year. However, making an objective assessment of the economic impact of the disease that is robust enough to allow comparison between different countries, farming systems and economies is extremely difficult and simple translation of the assumptions made in one system may be inappropriate elsewhere. Although neosporosis affects both dairy and beef cattle, most of the data available is for dairy production where birth of a live calf and subsequent yearly milk yield are the principal economic outputs. For economic modelling to be meaningful, accurate information must be available on factors such as (a) the incidence of bovine abortion directly attributable to Neospora infection in relation to the total abortion rate (b) the cost of abortion both in terms of foetal loss and loss of milk production (c) the (sometimes hidden) cost of premature culling or re-sale of infected animals. The relative importance of neosporosis will also be dependent on the initial investment and expected profit on each animal as well as the prominence of other infectious agents, both of which may vary considerably in different agricultural systems. This paper will summarise current data obtained from The Netherlands, Switzerland, Australia, the United States, Spain, Holland, Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom on the incidence and cost of bovine neosporosis. The aim of this paper will be (1 ) to provide a framework for discussion on the current estimates of the economic cost of bovine neosporosis (2) to review the quality of data available and identify where inadequacies in data or data collection exist (3) to compare methods used for computing economic impact with the aim of standardising best practice. 136 2\u00b7 Epidemiology and economic impact of Sarcocystis species A. M. Institut f\u00fcr Parasitologie, Tier\u00e4rztliche B\u00fcnteweg 17, D-30559 Hannover, Germany. The genus Sarcocystis comprises more than 120 species of heteroxenous cyst\u00adforming coccidia with differences in life cycle and pathogenicity. About 30 of these species occur in livestock (Tenter, 1995, Int. J. Parasitol., 25:1311\u00ad1330). Knowledge on the epidemiology and relative importance of different Sarcocystis spp. has been impeded by the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic methods for most of these species. However, Sarcocystis spp. can cause economic losses in the livestock industry in various ways. A primary infection with a high dose of sporocysts of a pathogenic Sarcocystis sp. can cause acute sarcocystiosis with high rates of mortality, in particular in sheep, goats and cattle. In pregnant animals, acute sarcocystiosis frequently results in foetal death, abortion or premature birth of the offspring. Chronic sarcocystiosis can result from the ingestion of a low dose of sporocysts of a pathogenic Sarcocystis sp. and can cause economic losses in the livestock industry due to reduced quality and quantity of meat, milk or wool in cattle, pigs, sheep and llamas. Additional economic losses are caused by infections with Sarcocystis spp. that are non\u00adpathogenic, but form macroscopic cysts in muscles of cattle or sheep, which results in condemnation of whole carcasses or affected parts after slaughter. Sarcocystis spp. infecting ruminants appear to be the species of the highest economic importance. In some countries, infections with Sarcocystis spp. have been estimated to account for up to 25% of annual losses directly attributable to parasitic diseases in sheep, cattle and llamas. In this session we will attempt an estimation on the potential economic losses caused by these parasites in the EU. factors other than immunoglobulins are also transferred from C. baileyi infected hens to their progeny. A dot\u00ad ELISA was developed to evaluate seroconversion of infected chickens which was 100% in both infected (IY and IC) groups. 137 ai. Pathogenicity of selected Toxoplasma gondii isolates after intravenous inoculation E. Copenhagen S, Denmark. The pathogenicity to 7 weeks old pigs of the human congenital Toxoplasma gondii strain \"NED\" (Dard\u00e9 et porcine et Microbiologica Scandinavia, 73: 85-92) was compared to 3 danish T. gondii isolates recently isolated from a slaughter pig (\"SVS P14\"), a fox heart (\"SVS Fox2\") and a sheep abortion (\"SVS 014\"), respectively. Five groups of 5 pigs each were inoculated intravenously with 104 tachyzoites of the different isolates propagated in vero cell cultures. Additionally, one group of 5 pigs was inoculated intravenously with 106 tachyzoites of the 119 strain. Eight pigs were included as PBS sham infected controls. Pigs inoculated with 10\" tachyzoites of NED, 119, P14 and Fox2 experienced a short-lived rise in body temperature from day 6-8 post inoculation (p.i.) without any apparent illness or inapp\u00e9tence, whereas control pigs and pigs inoculated with the 014 isolate had normal body temperature. Pigs inoculated with 106 tachyzoites of the 119 strain showed variable degrees of clinical illness and recurrent episodes of fever 4-17 p.i. Differential leucocyte count on peripheral blood re\u00ad vealed a significant lymphocytopenia on day 6 p.i. for all pigs except the 014 inoculated group. All T. gondii inoculated pigs seroconverted (ELISA) 14 to 17 days p.i., and significant differences in level of antibody re\u00ad sponses between groups were observed. At the time of abstract submission the following analyses were still in progress: T. gondii specific PCR on Ficoll purified blood in subsets and capacity oxidative burst in phagocytic cells of peripheral blood leucocytes from the pigs inoculated with 10\" or 106 tachyzoites of the 119 strain. In conclusion the preliminary results indicate clear differences in pathogenicity of the selected isolates of T. gondii when inocu\u00ad lated intravenously in young pigs. 138 aa.

Scottish Agricultural College Veterinary Science Division, Bush State, Penicuik, Midlothian EH26 OQE, UK. Neosporosis is a reproductive cattle caused by the protozoan Neospora caninum characterised by abortion. The predominant histopathological changes observed in the aborted foetus include multifocal, necrotising, non suppurative encephalitis, however very little is known about the parasite and the pathogenesis of the disease. Between November 1996 and November 1997, brains, selected foetal viscera and sera from over 500 aborted bovine foetuses, stillbirths and non viable neonates were examined to investigate the prevalence of bovine neosporosis in Scotland. Histopathological changes could be found in 42% of 374 cases examined and 3.7% showed changes indicative of neosporosis. Of the cases of suspected neosporosis, three were positive by immunohistochemistry showing a small number of tachyzoites associated with a glial response. Of the 464 foetal serum samples examined for IgG, 10.1% were seropositive for N. caninum antigen. Of these, 12.8% showed changes supporting the diagnosis of neosporosis whereas 2.7% of the seronegative cases showed the comparable type of changes. This might be due to the lack of detection of IgM. From the brains of a number of selected cases (86), amplification of DNA specific for N. caninum by PCR was attempted. In 12 cases, the presence of this DNA was demonstrated. Three of those showed changes consistent with the histopathological diagnosis of neosporosis and six cases were seropositive for N. caninum. To establish typing mechanisms to differentiate these DNA isolates from the field, a number of cell culture isolates from around the world were characterised by RADP analysis. Preliminary data from this characterisation will be presented. The markers established through this technique will than be applied for the characterisation of these field samples. In con\u00ad clusion, the survey confirms the presence of N. caninum infection in Scotland and raises the need to further characterise the parasite by establishing possible strain differences. *The authors would like to thank the help of all the laboratories of SACVS, Mrs A. Baird and Mrs V Forbes in generating the material. 139 23. Case control study of Neospora caninum associated abortion storms in dairy herds in The Netherlands W. Wouda^C. J. M. Bartels,2 A. R. Moe^and Y. H. Schukken2 animal Health Service, P. 0. Box 361, 9200 AJ Drachten, The Netherlands, department of Herd Health and Reproduction, Utrecht University, The Nethertands.. A case control study design was used to analyze Neospora caninum-associated abortion storms in 50 dairy herds during 1995-1997. The duration of the abortion storms ranged from 6 to 65 days (mean 41.5 days) and the cumulative proportion of aborting cows ranged from 0.11 to 0.57 (mean 0.26) of the cows at risk. Most abortion storms occurred during summer and early autumn. Prevalence of antibodies to N. caninum in 50 case herds (range 17 to 87%, mean 51.5%) was significantly higher than that in 100 control herds (range 0 to 53%, mean 13.9%). In general, seropositive animals were equally distributed in all age groups, which suggests that the infection had been perpetuated by vertical transmission and that the abortion storms had been induced by factors causing recrudescence of chronic infection rather than being the result of a recent introduction. How\u00ad ever, the high seroprevalence levels found indicate that horizontal transmission had taken place at some time point. An analysis of herd level risk factors for N. caninum-associated abortion storms was done by conditional logistic regression using a three-steps procedure. The analysis revealed that presence of dogs and presence of poultry on the farm were significant risk factors, suggesting involvement of these animals in the transmission of N. caninum infection to cattle. Another risk factor was feeding of moldy corn silage during summer. This is considered to be a factor which may induce recrudescence of a latent N. caninum infection by mycotoxins causing immune suppression. In conclusion, our results provide further evidence that both vertical and horizontal transmission play a role in the epidemiology of bovine neosporosis. Dogs and poultry may be involved in the introduction of the infection into a herd. Such infection may be perpetuated by vertical transmission without clinical signs until ,factors causing immune suppression induce reactivation of the infection which may lead to abortions. 140 ZW. Antibody responses in bovine fetal abortion due to neosporosis H.\u00adC. Slotved. L Jensen and R Lind Danish Veterinary Laboratory, B\u00fclowsvej 27, DK-1790 Copenhagen V, Denmark. The study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of fetal serology in the diagnosis of bovine neosporosis abortion. Pleural fluid from 15 fetuses of cows with confirmed neosporosis (group A), 9 fetuses with confirmed Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD) (group B) and 11 aborted fetuses without demonstrable infection (group C) were examined by Rocket Immunoelectrophoresis (fluid dilution 1:10), Mancini 1:40). The albumin concentration measured by the Rocket Immunoelectrophoresis was not significantly different in group A compared to both group and C. Group was significantly different from group C. Levels of total IgG from 0.02% to 11.0% of adult serum measured by the Mancini technique was found in all fetuses from group A and 7 fetuses in group B, with no significant difference between levels in the two groups. Only one fetus in group C had a detectable level of IgG. All fetuses in group A gave a specific IgG response (titer 20) against N. caninum using the IFAT\u00adtechnique, while no positive responses were found in group and C. The results from specific lgG1 by Iscom\u00adELISA showed only one false negative result in group A, with no reactions in group and group C, using an lgG1 cut\u00adoff OD\u00advalue at 0.08 (the mean response of group + 2 SD). The lgG2 results with a cut\u00adoff OD\u00advalue of 0.09 showed 3 false negative results in group A, but no reaction in group and C. The lgG1 and lgG2 response in group A was correlated according to the Spearman test (r = 0.6571). With increasing age of the fetuses, there ap\u00ad peared to be an increase in the amount of total IgG, specific IgG and specific lgG1, although this could not be confirmed statistically. On the basis of the obtained results it was concluded that the IFAT\u00admethod at a cut\u00adoff titer of 20, had a 100% success rate for detecting neosporosis in fetal fluid. The Iscom\u00adELISA also showed promising results. 141 is. Neospora caninum: Is oral transmission a possible route and C. Bj\u00f6rkman. National Veterinary Institute and Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, SE-75007 Uppsala, Sweden. Neospora caninum is a cyst-forming coccidian parasite with a canine definitive host and different mam\u00ad mals as possible intermediate hosts. In cattle the major route of transmission is considered to be transplacen\u00ad tal. External sources of infection has been evident in some reported outbreaks, but there has been no evidence as yet of transmission by oral ingestion of parasites in milk. The closely related organism Toxoplasma gondii has been transmitted experimentally via milk in mice. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential on N. caninum tachyzoites to infect neonatal calves when given orally with colostrum (Int. J. Parasitol. 1998, 28,1467-1472). Four full-term calves, seronegative to N. caninum and born from seronegative dams, were fed colostrum with added N. caninum tachyzoites of the Nc-SweB1 isolate in their first feed. Two of the calves were fed via gastric tubes, and the other two by feeding bottles. Weekly blood samples for N. caninum serology were collected. After 15 weeks the calves were euthanised, autopsies were performed, sections of CNS were sub\u00ad jected to immunohistochemical labelling and re-isolation of the parasite was attempted. In addition PCR was performed on selected parts of CNS. The two calves inoculated via gastric tubes remained seronegative throughout the observation period, while there was a marked rise in N. caninum antibody levels at 4-5 weeks p.i. in serum from the two calves inoculated by feeding bottles. The high level was maintained until the termination of the study. No pathological lesions were found, and no parasites were detected by immunohistochemistry or in the cell cultures. N. caninum DNA was, however, repeatedly demonstrated in one sample each (hippocampus) from the brains of the two bottle-inoculated calves. These results provide evidence that galactogenic transmission of N. caninum is possible in neonatal calves. Which implications the possibility of galactogenic transmission has for the epidemiology of N. caninum in cattle have yet to be determined. 142 26. Seroepidemiology of Neospora antibody responses in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in Spain S. Wright1, C. Gort\u00e1zar2, D. Fernandez de Luco 3 and D. Buxton 1 1 Moredun Research Institute, IRC, Pentland Science 50013 Zaragoza, Spain. The recent discovery that the dog is a definitive host for Neospora caninum (McAllister et al., 1998, Int. J. Parasitol., 28: 1473-1478) highlights the potential importance of canids in the transmission of neosporosis. Serological surveys of wild canids have revealed that a significant proportion develop an antibody response to this parasite, though the numbers are markedly less than those which have been infected by the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii, implying that potential sources of N.caninum infection are limited. Archived sera collected in the central Ebro valley region of Spain from foxes culled over a 4 year period were analysed for antibodies to N.caninum and T. gondii using an immunofluorescent antibody test, represent\u00ad ing a total of 61 animals. The cut off titre selected to represent seropositivity for N.caninum in canids varies between research groups, but if set at 1/256,8.2% of the foxes were seropositive for Neospora, contrasting seroposi\u00ad tivity for Toxoplasma. Using the 1/50 titre also commonly quoted, infection rates were increased to 21% for Neospora and 77% for Toxoplasma. These figures relate closely to other surveys of canids, including red foxes in Belgium (Buxton et al., 1997, Vet. Ree., 141:308-309), coyotes in the USA\u00dcJndsay et al., 1996, J. Parasitol., 82:657-659) and domestic dogs in the UK (Trees et al., 1993, Vet. Ree., 132:125-126). The potential role that foxes play in the epidemiology of neosporosis requires further study. 143 27. Immunisation of mice against neosporosis A. Lund\u00e9n1. J. E. Allen2, D. Buxton3 and S. Wright3 1 Department of Veterinary Microbiology, Section of Parasitology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, P.O.Box 7073, S-750 07 Uppsala, Sweden. 2 Institute of Cell, Animal and population Biology, University of Edinburgh, West Mains Road, Edinburgh, EH9 3JT, Scotland, UK. 3 Moredun Research Institute, Pentlands Science Park, Bush Loan, Penicuik, Midlothian, EH 26 OPZ Scotland, UK. Neospora caninum can infect a wide range of animal species and has during recent years been identified as a major cause of bovine abortion in many countries around the world. The aim of the work presented was to investigate the possibility of inducing protection against N. caninum infection by immunisation, using a BALB/ c mouse model. Groups of ten mice were immunised with a sublethal dose of live N. caninum tachyzoites of the NC\u00ad1 isolate or with one of three different antigen preparations: 1) N. caninum antigens incorporated into immune stimulating complexes (\u00a1scorns); 2) N. lysate mixed with Quii A; 3) N. caninum lysate in PBS. Control mice were given Quii A only. A second immunisation was undertaken after 6 weeks. Two weeks thereafter all mice were inoculated with 2.5 106 . caninum tachyzoites. Symptoms of acute infection were seen in all mice from day 4 post infection (p.i.). While the non\u00adimmunised controls remained ill until the end of the experiment, all mice immunised with live parasites or parasite lysate in Quii A recovered after 4\u00ad5 days. Of 9 mice immunised with N. caninum \u00a1scorns 7 recovered while 2 died at days 10 and 21 p.i. Most severely affected were the mice immunised with parasite lysate only. All of them died within 28 days p.i. The N. caninum specific antibody responses (lgG1 & lgG2a) and cytokine production (IFN\u00ad & IL\u00ad5) of splenocytes after in vitro stimulation with parasite antigen will be presented. Conclusion: Immunisation of mice with live parasites or parasite antigens either mixed with Quii A or incorporated into \u00a1scorns resulted in at least partial immunity against experimental neosporosis. In con\u00ad trast, immunisation with parasite antigen without any adjuvant appeared to increase the susceptibility to infection. 144 as. Investigations on the biological characteristics of two isolates of Neospora caninum R. Atkinson1, R A.W. Harper2, C. Morrison1 and J. T. Ellis1 Molecular Parasitology Unit, Department of Cell & Molecular Biology, University of Technology, Sydney, Westboume Street, Gore Hill, NSW 2065, Australia. 2Grafton Agricultural Research & Advisory Station (NSW Agriculture), Grafton, NSW 2460, Australia. The development of recombinant vaccines against Neospora caninum and neosporosis requires the development of suitable animal models and the in-vivo testing of recombinant antigens or live, attenuated organisms as vaccines. In recent years, mouse models for central nervous system (CNS) infections, transpla\u00ad cental transmission and foetal loss have been reported for N. caninum. The studies described here compared the biological properties of a bovine (NC-SweB1) and a canine (NC-Liverpool) isolate of N. caninum in a mouse model. Infection of in-bred Balb/C mice demonstrated marked differences in pathogenicity between the isolates. NC-Liverpool induced severe clinical signs of neosporosis in mice including discoordinated movement, hindlimb paralysis and coat ruffling with severe weight loss. In contrast NC-SweB1 induced similar but less severe symptoms in a much smaller proportion of mice over the same time period. NC- Liverpool infection resulted in intense inflammatory infiltrates and highly necrotic lesions in the brain whereas NC-SweB1 induced a milder meningoencephalitis. Passage in cell-culture over a period of 14 months did not affect the pathogenicity of NC-Liverpool. Immunoblots showed antibodies to N. caninum appeared earlier in mice inoculated with NC-Liverpool than with NC-SweB1. Thus the evidence provided indicates that NC-Liverpool and NC-SweB1 differ in their biological properties. In particular NC-SweB1 appears remarkably attenuated in its ability to induce a marked pathologic response in the mouse model. Therefore we investigated whether infection by NC-SweB1 would protect mice against a lethal challenge of NC-Liverpool. Infection of mice with NC-SweB1 induced a significant level of partial protection against a lethal dose of NC-Liverpool as judged by prolonged survival of mice, reduction in weight loss and brain histopathology. 145 European Commission EUR 19223 \u2014 COST 820 \u2014 Vaccines against animal coccidioses \u2014 Annual report 1998 Edited by Martin Shirley and Fran\u00e7oise Coudert Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities 1999 \u2014 145 pp. \u2014 21 29.7 cm ISBN 92\u00ad828\u00ad7713\u00ad2 Price (excluding VAT) in Luxembourg: EUR 22 COST Action 820 began formally in July 1994 following the signing of a memorandum of understanding by at least seven countries. The main objectives are: the evaluation of new vaccination strategies; the development of new vaccines, with the emphasis on recombinant vaccines; the study of innovative ways for vaccine production; the preparation of recommendations for industrial production and efficacy and safety evaluations of vaccines; the development of biomathematical models for evaluating the potential impact of immunisations on the epidemiology of infections with coccidia. For these objectives, it was anticipated that high priority will be given to three areas loosely defined as the following. Basic studies: to include aspects of the molecular biology and immunology of the coccidial parasites that have potential relevance for vaccine development. Such studies might include the development of strategies to identify protective antigens, the isolation and characterisation of antigens and fundamen\u00ad tal molecular analyses of the parasites, etc. Intermediate studies: to include evaluations of eucaryotlc expression systems to produce modified parasite proteins, investigations of the abilities of different viral and bacterial vectors to present antigens In different sites, examinations of different adjuvants and the initial small\u00adscale evaluation of potential vaccine candidates. Vaccination: to include the more practical aspects of vaccinations and larger scale trials of any out\u00ad standing recombinant vaccine candidates as will be required.
