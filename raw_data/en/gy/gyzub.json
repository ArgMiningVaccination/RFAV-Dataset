Sinha, currently a Grade 11 student at Henry Wise Wood Senior High School, says he became intrigued with the idea of scientific research after leaning about the Sanofi-Aventis BioTalent Chal - lenge \u2014 a program designed to introduce high school students to possible careers in science. He was in Grade 9 at the time. \"The requirement was to design a research ques - tion and write a research proposal about some - thing that you have been curious about, \" Sinha sa ys. \"I thought to myself 'Research question? I don't even have high school biology started yet. '\" Undeterred, Sinha put together a proposal about stem cells and HIV and contacted a number of re - searchers at the University of Calgary. Most didn't return his phone messages or emails. But Sinha caught the attention of Biernaskie, an assistant professor with the faculty of veterinary medicine. Biernaskie told Sinha \u2014 then 14 years old \u2014 that although his lab didn't work with HIV, he would help him find an alternative project to work on. Sinha took full advantage of the opportunity and has successfully taken on increasingly complex du - ties in the lab over the past two years. A 'QUICK LEARNER, ' SAYS MENTOR Sinha works closely with Ranjan Kumar, a PhD can - didate in the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, who has played the role of both supervisor and mentor to Sinha. Kumar says that while he initially thought that Sinha was \"very young\" to be involved in the type of research undertaken in Biernaskie's lab, those concerns quickly vanished. \"When I heard that there would be a high school student working in the lab, I wondered what he would be able to do, \" says Kumar, who was assigned the task of instructing the young student in basic laboratory techniques Although Sinha had no prior lab experience, his enthusiasm and curiosity quickly won over Kumar. \"He was really quite curious and wanted to know the science behind everything that we do. He asked a lot of questions, \" Kumar says. \"He is very smart and picked up things very fast. \" Kumar says encouraging young students to bec - me involved in science early is important \u2014 not only do students benefit, but scientists can as well. \"Until I started training Sarthak, I never realized how curious high school students are, \" Kumar says. \"The questions scientists ask are very complex. The ones he asked were very simple \u2014 and sometimes we had never thought from that angle. \" OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY , TRAVEL Sinha's work has given him the opportunity to compete in national and international science fairs. Presenting a project about nerve re-myelination that was based on his lab work, Sinha won a silver medal at the 2011 Canada-Wide Science fair. The event's 500 student finalists must qualify from ap - proximately 25,000 competitors who take part in 100 regional science fairs throughout Canada. His second-place showing earned him a trip to Pittsburgh and a spot on Team Canada for the 2012 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair \u2014 the largest international science competition of its kind. At this event, he received a third place prize in the medicine and health sciences category. In the summer of 2012, Sinha received an acceptance to take a biology course at the Universi - ty of Pennsylvania. He spent six weeks at the school studying alongside undergraduates \u2014 one of only two high school students accepted into the course. Born in India, Sinha moved to Calgary with his family six years ago. He says his family has been very encouraging of his academic and research endeavours \u2014 whether it has been offering moral support or practical support, such as ensuring he has a ride to the lab. Monty Slim, the former principal of Henry Wise Wood, says that Sinha is \"an amazing young man. \" In addition to maintaining a high academic stand - ing, Sinha is involved in other activities at Henry Wise Wood, including the debate team and serving as member of the Principal's Advisory Committee. He also represents Henry Wise Wood students as a member of the Chief Superintendent's Student Advisory Council \u2014 a leadership program where student representatives from other Calgary high schools meet once a month with Calgary Board of Education chief superintendent Naomi Johnson.\"Sarthak is there to contribute, and I know that his opinions are highly valued, \" Slim says. \"I am not sure where he finds time to sleep, \" Slim says. \"He has already accomplished more in his life - time so far, maybe, than I have. \" Cal garyj O urnal.

Photo by K ARR y tAylo R/ C A lg AR y jou R n A lKarry tayl O r kta ylor@cjournal.caDeath is a natural and sometimes unexpected part of life. But a review conducted by the Calgary Journal has found Alberta is the only province that doesn't give employees the legal right to have time to grieve and make funeral arrangements. In other provinces, bereavement leave \u2014 which can be paid or unpaid \u2014 can be off ered for up to 10 days. Meanwhile, employees in industries under the federal government's authority \u2014 such as shipping \u2014can get up to three days paid leave. Sarah Walker, the executive director of Hospice Calgary, says that bereavement leave is necessary because when a person experiences death, it can have a profound psychological impact. Even planning and organizing a funeral can take a toll, says Kathy Cloutier, community relations manager for McInnis and Holloway Funeral Homes. \"You can deal with a person who can't stop sobbing, who is very angry that it's a sudden death or someone who becomes angry at everybody: the paramedics, the cops, the other members of their family, the deceased or the funeral director just because they have to deal with it. \" Dan McKinnon, a registered psychologist, says such grief can have an effect on work performance. According to McKinnon, that grief \"lessens the ability to focus, it isolates you and can lead to poor decision making. \" TO ADOPT OR NOT TO ADOPT McKinnon is among those who think bereavement leave is necessary. \"It's very important that Alberta and employers provide some type of healing space for anyone who is going through a major health concern like grief. \" According to Walker, \"It's a completely reasonable thing to put into employment standards. \" However, Walker says when she talked with people in the government about bereavement, the response has been \"that the government didn't need to put it in legislation because employers would do the right thing. \" Nevertheless, Alberta Federation of Labour secretary-treasurer Nancy Furlong says such leave is a completely reasonable thing to put into employment standards. \"People who have lost loved ones have challenges in being able to attend to work in the immediate aftermath and so they should have a sub-standard that employers should apply. \" But not everyone feels that way. Brett Watson, the manager of South Calgary Funeral Services says, \"Most companies offer bereavement leave and it doesn't really make a difference if it's legislated or not. \" Cloutier, from McInnis and Holloway is of a similar view, since most people are able to take time off from work. As for the government, Alberta Human Services public affairs officer Jay Fisher confirmed there are no plans to change the situation. Nor does Furlong expect there to be any. \"It's a social contract type of thing that doesn't naturally flow from Conservative philosophy. \"no time to grieve This map shows the variance in bereavement leave times across Canada. Alberta is the only provice without legislated bereavement time, leaving employees vulnerable to the policies set out by their employer.

Ca APR 2013 5An unspoken sorrownOt f O rg Ot ten geOff Crane gcr ane@cjournal.caHow can families dealing with the loss of an infant cope with their grief? the death of an unborn or stillborn child is a devastating topic that most people feel uncomfortable talking about. Ac - cording to BabyCenter.ca, an estimated one in four pregnancies ends in a mis - carriage in Canada. Lindsay McCray is one of many women who has suffered the unfortunate loss of a child through miscarriage, and knows the feeling of isolation that comes with it. \"Really, you're left on your own to grieve. Apart from a support group we have here in Victoria, there's really nothing else out there. You're griev - ing the loss of this baby, but on top of that you feel so alone, \" says McCray. McCray's experience led her to get involved in a special project with the Saanich Legacy Foun-dation in Victoria. The project is called Little Spirits Garden. Lo - cated in the Royal Oak Burial Park of Victoria, the garden offers unique ways for people to ac - knowledge their loved one, from small concrete spirit houses to cedar flags, and an ossuary to inter ashes. All of these memorials are provided to the families free of cost. The Saanich Legacy Foundation has received over one-third of the funds needed to complete the project, and more donations are coming in from all over North America, according to presi-dent Paul McKivett. On the home front, Michael Pierson of Pierson's Funeral Service in Calgary is spearheading a simi - lar project, in partnership with Alberta Health Services, called Silent Hopes Memorial Services. Silent Hopes is a service that cares for the re - mains of any pregnancy loss, but especially those of miscarriages. Pierson collects these remains of miscarried pregnancies from various medical sites around Calgary. The remains are cremated and then interred at the Silent Hopes Memorial Garden in the Rockyview Garden of Peace Cem-etery. Every spring and fall, a Silent Hopes non- denominational service is held at the garden for parents and families of the infants whose remains are placed there. Additionally, parents can choose to have their infant's name placed on a stone tablet donated to the garden, memorial - izing their child. Pierson has had firsthand experience with the therapeutic powers this service provides, having attended a Silent Hopes service for his own infant lost by miscarriage. \"I can remember driving away from that ser- vice, and the burden we both felt was lifted from us by participating in that, and feeling like it was finally acknowledged appropriately. \" Pierson said the service is a way to help fami- lies deal with the confusion and isolation they can sometimes feel. \"It happens way more often than people re - ally realize. It's sometimes just not talked about much. \" While these special projects and services have helped many families with their grief, overcoming the loss of a miscarried or stillborn infant is not a one- size- fits- all pro - cess. Deb Bennett, an as - sociate professor of social work at Mount Royal University and ex - pert in grief, points out grief is a very individual process. As a result, she says, \"It makes it difficult, for me at least, to say this is the blanket solution. \"There was a time when parents didn't have the opportunity to have those pictures, the op - portunity to have a funeral. \" As a grief counselor for Alberta Health Servic - es Pregnancy and Infant Loss program, Azmina Lakhani hopes to see that action take place.\"My hope is that at some point, down the road, women, and men, will be able to talk about the impact this has had on them, \" says Lakhani. In 2011, through the efforts of a mother who had experienced a loss, and the support of the AHS PIL program, Mayor Nenshi signed a letter officially recognizing Oct. 15 as Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day. It's a day recognized nationally across the United Sates, but only in a few cities and provinces throughout Canada. \"I think we still have a long ways to go. This is where events like the Pregnancy and Infant Loss Aware - ness Day can make a r eal difference, \" says Lakhani. In the meantime, Lakhani points to oth- er services AHS pro - vides to help parents grieving the loss of a child. Memory packages and a personalized decora - tive box that contains mementos of the child, as well as some donated by volunteers, are just a few ways parents can have a tangible to reminder of the loved one they only spent a few precious moments with. \"Memory making is so important, \" Bennett says. \"When you lose a child through a miscar - riage or stillbirth, those memories are so few, and that's where the box comes in to help. \" Memory boxes, hand painted by volunteers, give parents a place to store mementos of the little one they've lost.

Photo by Courtney urbani/ C algary journalSignificant ink How Calgarians use tattoos to symbolize meaningin their lives What makes someone decide to get a tattoo? For some, the idea of get - ting ink permanently marking their body can be a turn off. For others, the practice of body art is a beauti - ful, unique and visual way to celebrate their per - sonal life achievements, or to remember those they have lost. \"A lot of people get small text pieces done just because it's got some meaning or remembrance for them, \" Jake DeSade, a tattoo artist at Bushido Tat - too, said. \"And then people get tattoos just because it's simply beautiful. \" While travelling in Papua New Guinea, DeSade spent some time with the tribes in the northern part of the country. There he experienced a com - plete culture shock when it came to the meaning of tattoos. \"Almost everyone there had facial tattoos, full body scarifications, and they'd see my tattoos and ask me what they meant to me, \" said DeSade \u2014 whose only noticeable tattoo is a large \"X\" on his wrist, with numerous others hiding on his chest, legs and side. In a culture where tattoos and scarifications are practices that contain deep meaning, it was clear the tribe's people didn't understand DeSade's rea- son for getting tattoos simply because they were beautiful. \"It got to the point where they would ask, and I would be like, 'It's from my tribe in Canada. ' They would look at me, nod and totally understand. \" While it's undoubtedly popular to follow DeSade's concept of getting tattoos simply for beauty, many people see the meaning behind a tattoo as more important. Looking into the lives of three people who used tattoos as a way to express loss, life experiences and passion for work and family, it becomes clear that while tattoos are pieces of art, they are also incredibly meaningful. KIELAN O'BRIEN As the needle touches down to her skin at Bushido Tattoo, Kielan O'Brien's body slightly twitches from the unexpected pain. In addition to carrying her mom on her back in the form of a butterfly, her best friend on her left wrist in the form of an anchor and her grandfather on her right foot in the form of a shamrock, O'Brien is now commemorating all those she has lost with a new tattoo in the form of a pocket watch surrounded by flowers. O'Brien said the watch symbolizes that, \"No matter what happens in this life, I will see these people again, and it's just a matter of time. \" Her first tattoo, the butterfly on her back, symbol - izes freedom as O'Brien's mom battled brain cancer for four months before passing away in 2006. With her mom diagnosed when she was only 12, losing her mom was incredibly painful. \"You feel like there's this piece of you that's miss- ing, and you're never going to get it back, \" O'Brien said. \"And that's really hard to come to terms with because you are never going to see them again, or hear their laugh, or hear them tell you their favourite joke, or even hear them walking down the stairs in the morning. \"I am never going to see my mom at breakfast again and that's really painful. It hits me at random times that she's gone, or they're gone, and they aren't coming back. \" With consent from her father, O'Brien got the tat - too for her mom when she was just 16, and while many would disagree with getting a tattoo so young, O'Brien said: \"I felt like I was forgetting the little things. I was forgetting her laugh, or her smile or what she looked like \u2014 just little tiny things that you have one day, then suddenly they're gone, that you take for granted. You might think 'I'll remember that forever. I'll remember what she looks like for - ever, ' but it does go away and pictures don't always do it justice. \" ROBERT (JOE) GREEN Coming from a military family, Cpl. Robert (Joe) Green said he joined the Canadian army at the age of 19 because he felt it was always in his blood. In 2005, he left for Afghanistan where his com - pany, a section comprised of about 150 soldiers, lost seven members. After coming home, Green wore a bracelet in remembrance for the seven who were killed. But he knew that wasn't enough to honour those who had fallen. One day at work, he left for lunch and got a tat - too in their memory. Insisting it was not an impulse tattoo, he said: \"It came to the point where I had been saying I was going to get this for so long, I'm going to do it right now. I just had to. \" Starting with the first member killed on his tour, the tattoo goes up his arm in a spiral pattern, each line starting with a poppy, the initials of one of the soldiers, followed by the date he was killed. ang ELa W it HER awither@cjournal.ca Che Ck out \" Et ER na L i mag ES: t HE docum E nta R y\" as part of the Calgary Journal's in f ocu S series airing on C t V2 on s unday, a pril 7 at 5:30 p M.ouR c ity caLga R yjou R na L. ca a P r 2013 6\"Back in the day, it was less common.

It rep - resented our unit during World War I. \" ANDREW STELMASCHUK Growing up as the only boy in a Ukrainian family, police officer Andrew Stelmaschuk takes pride in his last name. \"People express themselves through piercings, or dying their hair (or) wearing a fashion state - ment, \" he said. \"That's not permanent \u2014 that's generally just a phase for most people. A tattoo lasts for life and my family's there for my whole life. \" With his parents' names on his arms, a big piece with \"Mom\" and \"Dad, \" on his back, and his last name across his chest, Stelmaschuk's inspiration for getting tattoos comes from \"the commitment to make that decision that you want to express who you are, that commitment that you are will - ing to show what you have your feelings towards, what you care about \u2014 things like that make it worthwhile to me. \" Unlike DeSade, Stelmaschuk sees a greater importance in having tattoos with a strong mean- ing. \"To me, tattoos always meant something of your own life experience \u2014 maybe a path that you have taken \u2014 things that have happened in your past, things you hope will happen in the future, \" Stel - maschuk said. \"But how can you fill up your entire arm by the time you're 19 or 20 years old and say it actually means something to you? \"Generally when I get a tattoo, my mind is in a state of calm. I know that the end product is something I am going to cherish for a long time \u2014 for the rest of my life obviously \u2014 so I don't sit there having any regrets or wonder what my family or friends are going to think about it. Be - cause it's all about what I want, and what still represents my family. \" THE TATTOO EXPERIENCE While O'Brien sits to get her latest piece of body art, she winces through the obvious pain that comes with getting a tattoo on her side \u2014 an incredibly sensitive part of the body. She said, \"I think that this is an hour of pain, when for my mom (it was) months and months of pain. So if I can do this little thing in order to remember her, then to me it's not painful. It's good, and it's a really comforting experience. \"I am very much influenced by the people that I have lost, \" she said. \"At the same time though, I have to keep liv - ing my life. If I completely shut down and all I am is sad about it, I'm not going to go where I want to go. \" After two sessions and multiple hours under the needle, Kielan O'Brien's final tattoo is revealed. Photo by Courtney urbani/ C algary journalouR c ity caLga R yjou R na L. ca a P r 2013 7When it comes to gender, Buck Angel is adamant about one thing: it isn't de - fined by what is between your legs. \"We have always been taught that a penis makes you a man and a vagina makes you a woman, \" Angel says. \"But gender is much more complicated than that. \" Angel has lived his life questioning notions of gender. He was born a female. In his twenties, he underwent hormone treatment and breast removal surgery. He later gained notoriety as the first trans- gendered pornography star. Gradually, he has trans- formed himself into an educator, public speaker and advocate \u2014 not just for the transgendered commu - nity, but for all those who he says \"don't fit into a box. \" After being invited to share his message of self- acceptance and sexual tolerance to audiences across North America, a documentary about his life, Mr. Angel, recently premiered at the SXSW Film festival. He recently visited Calgary to participate on public sex panel sponsored by the Fairy Tales Presentation Society, and sat down with the Calgary Journal to discuss life, labels and why he thinks we are still so hung up on sex in 2013. There can be a tendency for society to stigmatize those who deviate from the so- called norms of sexuality. As somebody who has publically advocated for a more fluid and flexible view of sex and gender, have you run into this? Definitely. I am a pornographer \u2014 that is what I do, and that is where my roots lie. I am also a man with a vagina. But I realized, because of these things, many people wouldn't give me the time of day or respect me or consider what I have to say as being valid. I had to repackage myself as a motivational speaker, an educator and an advocate. Then all of a sudden, everyone wanted to speak to me. People still have this idea that sex is dirty and bad and that we shouldn't talk about it. People think that sex is evil and causes problems. But sex is a natural thing. Everybody does it. It's 2013, not 1950. Does it surprise you that such attitudes about sex and sexual - ity still persist? You know, it really is shocking. I live in Mexico \u2014 which is considered a third world country. But it isn't a third world country because, despite being a very strict Catholic country, they have legalized same-sex marriage there. Yet the U.S. hasn't. It seems to me, in many ways, people are moving backwards in their thoughts. The reality is that change is necessary to evolve, and to make things more accessible. It is obvious that sexuality is evolving. Look at, for example, the transgender community. In the last three or four years, it has just exploded and has become more out there in the open. So that in itself makes me wonder why people don't want change. I think people are scared of change \u2014 there is this idea that change means rebellion and that people will be out of con-trol. But change is good. You have worked to get your message regarding sexual empowerment and self-acceptance out to a very broad audience. Why is that so important to you?I don't really live my life as a transgendered man. I live my life as a man \u2014 which is what I always wanted to be. So it's important for people to understand that I don't speak for the transgen - dered community. That isn't because I don't iden - tify as a transgendered person. It's because there are so many of us, and we all have different voices. I came to realize that my message needs to be heard outside of the transgendered community because they already know everything that I am talking about \u2014 I don't need to educate that community. I need to educate the world. It's also because my life is not about being a transgen - dered man. It's about becoming comfortable with yourself, whatever that means \u2014 whether you are gay or straight or something else. My message is about more than gender or sexu- ality. It is about teaching people how to learn to love themselves. It sounds cheesy, but that is how I transcended my porn work into my transgen - dered advocacy work and now into becoming a motivation speaker and educator. Did you have difficulty breaking out of being pigeonholed as a spokesperson for the whole transgendered commu - nity? Yes. I have had to constantly stress that I am not a spokesperson, but understand that I am role model. I am happy being a role model because a lot of my work touches on sexuality \u2014 and I am a firm believer that sexuality is an important part of being a person. When you get in touch with your sexuality, it can free so much up for you. Where do you see that you can make the biggest contribution? I think I am changing the way that people really look at what makes you a man or what makes you a woman. I am making people question gender. If you really think about it, what is gender? How could that possibly decide what makes me into a man or a woman? I think my biggest contribution has been showing that genitals have nothing to do with being male or female \u2014 it has everything to do with you as a person.

At 25 years old, she was taking six to 10 codeine-infused painkillers every day. She could no longer go to movies and playing sports was out of the question. Desperate for help, she dragged herself to 114 appointments over a three-month span. Finally, in the fall of 2012, she recieved a diagnosis. Schmidt was suffering from ankylosing spondylitis \u2014 a form of arthritis that typically attacks the hips, spine, lower back and shoulders. Schmidt is one of an estimated 4.2 million Ca - nadians affected by arthritis and autoimmune diseases \u2014 which are the most common chronic health conditions in Canada, according to a report by the Public Health Agency of Canada. PAIN RELIEF THROUGH YOGA Although there is no known cure for arthritis, many people who are affected by it, including Schmidt, have turned to yoga to alleviate the pain. \"Yoga has helped to relieve the muscles and increase my strength, energy and flexibility, \" Schmidt said. According to Yoga for Arthritis: A Scoping Review, published by the National Institutes of Health \u2014 the elements of yoga, including stretching, bal - ance and the ability to modify the postures and pace, are beneficial for people affected by arthritis. The study said that yoga also has psychologi - cal benefits because of its emphasis on breathing, stress management and meditation. YOGA FUNDRAISER EARNS $170,000 Schmidt took part in the Power of Movement fun - draiser earlier this week, put on by the Arthritis Re - search Foundation. It's the largest yoga fundraiser in Canada, dedicated to increasing awareness and raising money for arthritis research. More than 70 yoga enthusiasts gathered at Eau Claire Market for a one-hour session led by three Calgary yoga instructors, raising nearly $7,000 for the cause. The event ran in 13 other cities across Canada on the same day, raising a total of more than $170,000. Kim McNeil, an independent yoga teacher, was one of the instructors at the event. She said that she has seen the benefits that yoga can have for people affected by arthritis. \"When you have arthritis, you get into the cycle of experiencing pain so you stop moving, so you experience more pain, \" she said. She said that this inactivity can lead to stress and depression, but yoga allows people to move again in a safe, gentle way.YOUNGER FACE FOR ARTHRITIS According to the Public Health Agency's report, arthritis can affect people of all ages \u2014 from tod - dlers to people in their \"prime working lives. \" Brad Schaefer is one of those people. Fifteen years ago, at the age of 31, he was diagnosed with osteoarthritis. At the age of 37, he had his first hip replacement. He said that it's rare to be that young and have a joint fall apart so quickly. \"Arthritis is not for the little old lady sitting in the rocking chair trying to knit, \" he said. \"There's a new face to it and it doesn't mean that we have to stop living \u2014 but we have to modify what we do. \" Like Schmidt, Schaefer said that he has found relief from practicing yoga, and that it has been his \"saving grace. \" \"It quiets your mind, \" he said. \"When you're liv - ing with this degree of pain, you're willing to try anything. Yoga \u2014 as an exercise \u2014 expands your joints. Every other exercise you do compresses them and that's the worst thing you can do with arthritis. \" For both Schaefer and Schmidt, one of the hardest things about the disease is other people not understanding the pain. \"People are very quick at judging when they can't see something, \" Schaefer said. Schmidt pointed out, \"Even if someone looks completely normal, it doesn't mean that they're not in horrible pain. \" MOVING FORWARD Schmidt said she plans on staying as active as possible. \"I'm going to try different things and see where my limit is, \" she said. For Schaefer, it's important not to let the disease define him or take over his life. \"You let it have as much power as you're willing to give it. And as long as you don't give it all of you, it will never have all of you. \"Life is too amazing \u2014 no matter what you have. As long as you can still put two feet on the floor, you've got it made. \"There is no known cure for arthritis. However, some who suffer from the disease say that they have found pain relief in practicing yoga.

But along with the quality of care, comes the business appeal of owning a pharmacy in Alberta. However, this interest may not always coincide with the corporate model of larger organizations such as Shoppers Drugmart or grocery store de - partments. By owning and operating pharmacies on their own, Bob Geldreich \u2014 pharmacist and owner of Script Pharmacy \u2014 says there is \"opportunity to fol - low your own ambitions and passions a bit more closely, \" both with medicine and business. University of Alberta student, Ken Soong \u2014 who is also president of Alberta Pharmacy Students As- sociation \u2014 says steps to further the business ap - proach to pharmacy are now part of the courses and options provided to students. Pharmaceutical science students are now re - quired to take a mandatory business management course, including the \"introduction of business con - cepts and developing business plans. \" Although he believes the main focus is therapeu - tics and clinical knowledge, Soong is now consid - ering a new option at the university. Students can now graduate with both a degree in pharmacy and business after a one-year concentrated MBA pro - gram prior to their final year. This can provide a \"major business push\" that stu - dents are excited about and interested in learning. This option, according to James Kehrer, dean of the faculty of pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences, is one of the ways the U of A is training their students \"for the future and tomorrow of pharmacy. \" But with private business and self-direction \u2014 regardless of education level \u2014 comes the struggle to keep pharmacies up and running. For Geldreich, the main challenges come from lack of funding from low taxes: \"Having govern - ment realize that pharmacies are a business\" and receiving \"kickbacks\" for those pharmacies. A fee structure \u2014 determined by Alberta gov - ernment and Blue Cross \u2014 is set to a maximum price for pharmacies to sell prescription medica - tion. Discounters such as drug marts are able to charge below the maximum. Geldreich says this causes the Alberta govern - ment to argue that pharmacists are not in need of the full charge or profit and therefore need no increase in funding. With taxes, Geldreich explains that the dis - pensing fee pharmacies use as a source of in- come has not increased with inflation. A com- plication, he argues, that will only grow as the baby boomer generation emerges. \"Fifty per cent of all prescriptions are filled for seniors, but we know that the senior population is increasingly becoming the majority of the total population, \" said Geldreich. \"It will be impossible for younger generations to fund the baby boom-ers. \" Geldreich's solution seems simple: either raise taxes \u2014 which government has not shown inter - est in \u2014 or have seniors pay more of the cost. Script Pharmacy takes part in the western divi- sion of PharmaChoice, which aims to group to - gether 400 pharmacies giving them larger buying power and better prices from wholesalers, manu - facturers, and suppliers. For Geldreich, in today's pharmacy atmosphere, the key to success is knowing when, \"to have our professional hat on, or our business hat on. \"L ARISSA P I n HAL lpinhal@cjournal .caLearning the business of pharmacies \"It will be impossible for younger generations to fund the baby boomers.\" BoB Geldreich, pharmacist and owner of Script Pharmacy \u00bb GO t O cal G aryj O urnal.ca f O r m O re c O vera G e O f health-related issues, events and discussi O ns \u00bb cALg ARY j O u R n AL. cA APR 2013 10HeALt HY LI v I ng Loose Leaf Healthy truths behind tea Green, black, oolong, it doesn't matter \u2014 all have benefits for health HaNNaH CaW seY hc awsey@cjournal.ca Green tea is often reported for its health benefits, ranging from clearing up acne, to curing major health ailments. But why are health benefits generally only being reported for green tea? Jonathan Kane \u2014 owner of the Naked Leaf Cafe located on 10th Street N.W. in Kensington \u2014 sells various types of loose leaf tea. He explained that green tea is in the news because the original studies on the health benefits of tea came out of Japan, where the drink of choice is green tea. It is a common mis - conception that only green tea is good for the drinker. Kane said all teas start out the same. \"Teas are made from the same tea leaf. Whether it's green, white, oolong or black, they're just processed differently, \" Kane said. \"All of them have anti- oxidants, caffeine and benefits. \"I tell people if they're really look - ing for nutrition, just find teas they like and drink them through - out the day. \" According to iVil - lage.ca \u2014 a Canadian women's online health magazine \u2014 some of the top reasons for drinking tea are to re - duce risk of heart attack and to bolster immune defence. The American Journal of Nutrition, meanwhile, stated that possible benefits of consuming tea include decreasing risk of cataracts and arthritis, as well as increasing bone density. Dr. Janette Hurley \u2014 a Calgary-based family doctor and general practitioner \u2014 recommends tea to her patients all the time as a healthy addi - tion to any diet. \"You drink in all the antioxidants and all the goodness when you drink tea, \" Hurley said. \"The caffeine found in tea is more gentle than the caf -feine found in coffee. \" Hurley practices what she preaches. \"My favorite tea depends on the mood and the time of day: in the morning I start off with a cup of green tea called Sky Between the Branches \u2014 which is my favorite, \" Hurley said. Hurley maintains that tea drinkers have re - duced cholesterol levels, stronger bones and lower rates of cardiovascular disease and cancer. \"I prefer using loose leaf tea because you use the whole leaf. From my point of view it is a much better form of tea. \" In addition, Hurley said teas with artificial flavouring or over-processed teas or tea lattes won't provide the health benefits loose leaf tea will. \"Regular consumption of tea appears to re - duce the risk of cancer of the breast, prostate and other organs, \" Hurley said. Claiming any type of tea is the healthi - est is subjective, but if someone is looking for the tea with the best health benefits, Kane suggested mat - cha. \"(Matcha) is a very high-end green tea leaf that has been ground into a very fine powder. When you prepare matcha, you actually ingest the leaf so you're get - ting maximum vita - mins, antioxidants and caffeine. With regular tea, you steep it and throw the leaves out \u2014 with matcha you ingest it, \" Kane explained. However, any tea can be ground up for the health benefits. If someone doesn't like green tea but would like to make a powdered tea, they can purchase a tea grinder and make their own powder. There's more reasons to drink tea than just the health benefits \u2014 most tea lovers consume it for the taste and ritual. A recent customer to the Naked Leaf, Brandy James, said she drinks tea because it makes her feel better. \"I do believe green tea is good for you and I drink it every day, \" said James, whose favourite is a mint blend. \"I feel better when I drink tea rather than cof- fee, and there's always a tea for your mood. \" 7 reasons to drink tea: 1can reduce the risk of cancer 2lowers cholesterol levels 3causes lower rates of cardiovascular disease 4 bolsters your immune defense 5 decreases the risk of cataracts and arthritis 6 increases bone density 7 lots of anti-oxidants, which reduce cell damage SOURCE S: d R. jan E tt E h UR l E y, ivillag E.C a, am ER i C an j OUR nal O f n U t R iti O n\"You drink in all the antioxidants and all the goodness when you drink tea.

I had originally traveled to the small violin shop that evening to look for a new bow, after being advised that it was necessary. A new violin had been the farthest thing from my mind. My mother continued, \"I just have a feeling the person who loaned us the violin might take it back. \" I loosened the bow in my hands and set it back on the table, tentatively picking up another. HARMONIOUS BOND Violin has been my life for the past five years \u2014 daily practice, weekly lessons, orchestra rehearsals and chamber music. A lifelong curiosity that had turned into my deepest passion, the truest way to express feelings that if I tried to put into words, I could barely scrape the surface. The violin I had been using was built in the 1930s in Germany. The varnish was hazelnut brown but, in certain lighting, it looked darker. The way it sound- ed was incredible. A smaller voice, but it was lush and deep. On the lower registers I pushed to hear its secrets, asking to open up to me \u2014 and it did. The violin had seen the years, the top worn down with a few chips and cracks. It belonged to a friend of my mother, who had loaned me the violin four years ago in case the rental I had been using needed repair. Eventually, after calling to return the violin \u2014 to no avail \u2014 and a restoration, it was mine. I named it Janine, after my favourite violinist Janine Jansen. Janine was with me through my best and my worst. She was there for my acceptance into a conservatory orchestra. She was witness to my musical growth, and we forged an intimate rela - tionship. She fit so well in my hands. Everything synchronized when we played together. We were a team. Janine and I share a bond that many musicians have with their instruments. World-renowned vio - linist Sarah Chang told me in an email that her priceless Guarneri del Gesu violin is \"my voice when I'm onstage. I feel that it's almost an attach - ment of my own body. \" That's why it was so odd when my mother pro - posed a new instrument. It made sense, having reached a level where a high quality instrument was necessary. However, it had never crossed my mind that I would need a new violin right now. MUSICAL ANXIETIES As I tucked Janine into her case, I knew our days together would be numbered. I worried that I wouldn't be able to find another violin capable of satisfying my musical needs. I knew there were better instruments, and it would be an upgrade. But it was the relationship, the seamless merge of emotion and instrument, that I was fearful of losing. Janine had seen the deepest caverns of my soul, she knew how to unravel feelings within that I couldn't express through any other medium. A new instrument would be a stranger. After much thought I went back to the shop to see their violins within my price range. As 10 violins were laid before me, I noted their features, and once I had my hands on them, the maker and the year. Old instruments typically sound better, but new instruments have the most potential to change their sound over time. There was a way of knowing if an instrument fit. If it was a \"no, \" I knew right away. A \"maybe, \" required a couple lines of music or different ar - ticulations to decide. If I was still unsure, I would take a violin home for a week. It was difficult to find an instrument comparable to how Janine sounded or felt. The process was disheartening, having so much dif -ficulty finding a violin that I would like. NEW PARTNER The ninth violin I tried was the one. It was the appearance alone that first caught my eye, the rich terracotta brown varnish that reminded me of Florentine shingles. The details of the antique finishing on the two-year-old instrument left me in awe. The tone was resonant and smooth. As I played the instrument for the first time, its subtle nu - ances and angelic overtones struck a chord. In an instant, I knew that this was it. With a new instrument, the possibilities of un - raveling its mysteries are endless and it's all mine. No one before me has known how this violin sounds on this or that note, or the deep vibrations in the hollow wooden body. This violin will be my new partner for many years. I named it Lady Florence \u2014 because of the varnish. When we play together, a new musical mystery is unraveled. Her secrets are a constant source of motivation for me, my primary reason to improve my abilities. Every few weeks I take Janine from her case and we play for an hour or two. Each note she makes now reminds me of going back to an old lover, so familiar and full of memories. In the four years that Janine and I played together, I discovered my passion for music and a deep connection to my instrument.

My extreme reactions to low temperatures are symptoms of Raynaud's disease VER onica PocZa vpocza@cjournal .ca Putting a new key on my keychain. Hold - ing a cold fruit for too long. Opening a cold beer can. Digging in the freezer for the last popsicle. Shoveling the drive - way. These are some of the tasks that are momentarily unpleasant for anyone, but that are now almost impossible for me \u2014 causing unbearable pain, numbness and discoloration in my fingers, lasting hours upon hours. This extreme reaction began to happen this year, around wintertime. In some of the worst moments of it, my fingers feel thick, swollen and sprained \u2014but look dead and lifeless. I've always been the girl who's \"so cold\" and has the heat up \"crazy high\" in my car \u2014 poor circula - tion runs on my mom's side of the family \u2014 so I just took these new, uncomfortable reactions as an unfortunate repercussion of that. I didn't seek medical help. However, upon a trip to the doctor for a shot, my very attentive general practitioner noticed the extreme discoloration in my fingers and sent me off to do some testing. Surprised to learn a diagnosis was even possible, I went off to do the required blood work and arte - rial ultrasounds \u2014 to find that I have Raynaud's disease. WHAT IS IT? Dr. Dianne Mosher, division head of rheumatol - ogy at the University of Calgary, describes Rayn- aud's as, \"A condition where the blood vessels in the extremities reversibly constrict during cold temperatures and emotional stress. The fingers will become cold, painful, and turn either white, purple or blue. \" It's definitely painful, sometimes beyond descrip - tion. Mosher explains the source of that internal pain as deriving from \"the extreme lack of blood supply to a tissue. \" Good thing my doctor is thorough \u2014 as Mosher says, \"Undiagnosed Raynaud's phenomenon can lead to ulcers on the finger tips and even gan - grene if there is not enough blood supply. \" Whether the reactions are considered major or minor, according to the Government of Canada's Occupational Health and Safety statistics, I'm one of the lucky four per 10,000 Canadians experienc - ing the unfortunate setbacks to daily life in a cold environment. NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO I found my diagnosis to be quite a fluid process. But, I wondered what it was like for others. \"I was just glad to finally have a name for it, \" Deb Ashton, a mother of two, says of the symptoms. \"When my fingers would turn white and be so painful \u2014 no one took it seriously \u2014 I couldn't even untie my soccer shoes after a cold game. \" Ashton was diagnosed over 12 years ago. I found relief in learning there was a diagnosis, however I still had all these questions \u2014 I'm feel - ing invaded, having a disorder and not knowing why it's present in my body. The answers I've been getting from doctors and experts alike - to no fault of their own - remain a bit unclear. \"The cause of primary Raynaud's \u2014 the one that acts alone \u2014 is still unknown. It's highly believed to be hereditary, \" says Mosher. I'm 21, and she adds that this is right around the age \u2014 early adulthood \u2014 when connective tissue disorders start appearing. \"No one knows why, \" Mosher says. She says that secondary causes are much more clear, as symptoms usually appear after frostbite injury, trauma or accompanying connective tis - sue diseases. There's no way to prevent or cure Raynaud's, and Mosher says, \"awareness starts upon diagno - sis, learning what you can and can't do. \" TAKING NECESSARY MEASURES Mosher says there's been no one good solution in terms of medication for Raynaud's. \"Some find blood pressure medications that dilate the vessels helpful, \" she says. Surgery was formerly tried, she says, \"but most patients just take the basic, precautionary measures to avoid an attack now. \" For me, that means shopping for fun little things like heated mittens, heated blankets and beer- can sleeves. The condition is definitely not life threatening, but boy is it a nuisance. The odds are definitely against my favor because Raynaud's reactions can be triggered from both cold temperatures and stressful situations. I'm a student and live in Calgary \u2014 stress and cold sum me up. I usually experience my Raynaud's on a daily ba - sis, especially in the winter. But it will be minor if I can whip on a mitten or run my hand under warm water before the blood supply is cut off. There are silver linings to everything. Upon this diagnosis, I finally have a reason to demand that automatic car starter I've always wanted \u2014 and I will never, ever, agree to shovel the walk again. I can honestly say, \"It's dangerous to my health. \" It's crucial that I stay warm all winter.

I had just taken a few quick bites of their famous \"the bull vs. the volcano\" flavoured wings and my body was in shock. Adrenaline pumped through me as my shaking hands reached for the small glass of milk that I had ordered in anticipation of the explosion of spice that would surely erupt after my first bite. While I knew these wings would be spicy, I wasn't expecting this. I had always been a fan of spicy food. My step-dad and I were almost fanatics, putting hot sauce on everything from our eggs to bowls of soup when we were sick. So when I was dared by the Calgary Journal to try these wings, I didn't think much of it. I wrangled up some friends and we made a night of it. Signing the waiver \u2014 which re - leased the Bull and Finch of any li - ability for what might happen to my stomach in the meal's aftermath \u2014 I was un-phased, laughing it off as a cute marketing ploy. Boy was I wrong. \"We did have a lawyer look at the waiver and it's legally binding, \" says Tony Balakas, the pub's owner. \"Al - though I must admit, it does add to the experience. \" Introducing its waiver-required \"the bull vs. the volcano\" wings in 1996, the Bull and Finch is well known for having some of the hottest wings in the city, Balakas says. While the family recipe is a well- kept secret, Balakas did tell me that the heat in the wings is due in large part to habanero peppers, and a double baking process that seals in the flavour. \"Baking them the first time kind of brings out the flavours, and then do - ing so a second time solidifies them, giving the wings an extra punch, \" Balakas says. An extra punch is right \u2014 one bite into the wing and my mouth was on fire. Another bite and my eyes welled up. The third bite was when the sen- sation hit the back of my throat and I dropped the wing back onto the plate, defeated. I would like to say that it was extremely spicy, but honestly, I couldn't tell you \u2014 all I felt was pain. I gulped several glasses of milk \u2014 even ate sour cream \u2014 but nothing could stop the burning sensation. Within a few minutes I had de - veloped hives, realizing that I had t ouched my chest with the wing sauce still on my hands. My lips and ears swelled up, and turned bright red. In between glugs of water I gig- gled at my stupidity until finally \u2014 about 30 minutes later \u2014 my tongue went back to normal. To put the blistering heat of these wings in perspective, I checked the rating of the habanero on the Sco - ville heat scale \u2014 which measures the hotness of chili peppers, or any - thing derived from chili peppers. It measures a whopping 350,000 Scoville heat units, as compared to cayenne pepper at just 50,000 units or the chipotle pepper at just 10,000 units. Ouch. \"You get a lot of tough guys who are like, 'These aren't so bad, ' hold - ing back tears as they try to defend themselves, \" Balakas says. \"Person - ally, I can't even dip my pinky in the sauce to taste them, they are just too spicy. \" While I will never be biting into another waiver wing myself, I will enjoy bringing my friends out to see if they can beat the heat of \"the bull vs. the volcano. \" For me, it wasn't about the food or or the taste, rather an experience that will not soon be forgotten \u2014 by me, or my stomach.

God, I think my husband has been killed in a car wreck when I see them outside with their flashlights. The black hair on the back of my dog stands straight up. I hold the leather collar around his neck tightly in my fist \u2014 his rumbling growl shakes beneath my skin. \"We're here to check on the safety of Ellie*, \" one of the large, solid looking officers says. He seems deeply concerned, and so does his partner. Me \u2014 well, now my heart is slowing to a some - what less-hysterical pace. My husband is not dead. There is no tragedy. I know entirely what this is all about. My stepdaughter's grandmother has a mental illness that twists her mind with paranoia. She often involves the law \u2014 mostly the family-court with various orders. But this is the first time the cops have come to me. \"Can we take a look at her?\" the taller one asks \u2014 he must have noticed my sudden ease be - cause he seems a lot less stern. \"Of course \u2014 she's actually sleeping, \" I say as the three of us walk down the hall of our tiny home. I see the glare of their flashlights dart into my kitchen and my bedroom checking for the markings of an unfit parent, I guess. But they find nothing. My six-year-old is fast asleep in her little bed, our black cat curled in the nook of her legs. She starts to rub her eyes as the flashlight crosses over her face. \"Hi sweetheart, \" the cop says very gently. And that is that. We all walk back to the door. They ask me if I might know what this is all about. I know they don't have time for the ins-and- outs of the last five years. The months of calm followed by out-of-the-blue packages summon - ing my husband to court. The horrific and often bizarre accusations of abuse and neglect coupled with a plea to have full custody of our child. I know these men are too weary for the drama of it all. They've seen children in real danger. \"Her grandmother has bipolar, \" I say. \"She does this kind of thing quite a lot. I can't really tell you w hy.\" I close the door and lock the handle behind them \u2014 crouch on the sofa by the window and watch the officers sit in their car outside. I think about how my house is that house right now. Maybe the neighbours are watching and won - dering. I feel a strange mix of shame and contentment. I'm that neighbour on the street with the cops at their door, but I also might be the one call those guys get tonight that brings them relief. I walk back to bed, and hope that this never happens again. Hope there is someway to ease the woman's broken mind. To help her see that the only abuse Ellie is getting comes from mo - ments like this \u2014 police, social workers, and worn out judges \u2014 each of them obligated to search, and each of them finding nothing but parents doing the best they can with a child who is turning out pretty damn great. Just pray, I guess, for a miracle or something. Or for a judge that will finally say \"enough is enough, you can't do this anymore. '' Editor's note: *Names have been changed to protect privacy.

In 2012, Rubin published a book \u2014 The End of Growth: But Is That All Bad? \u2014 in which he argues that rising oil prices will bring the growth of Cana- dian and other western economies to a halt. Ac- cording to Rubin, as prices become too high for people to burn non-renewable fossil fuels such as oil, carbon emissions will drop, slowing the pace of climate change. Suzuki, who recently published a new environ - mentally themed book of his own called Everything Under the Sun (co-authored by Ian Hanington), said he became interested in Rubin's ideas. The two are currently on a cross-country speak - ing tour across eight Canadian provinces. The Calgary Journal's Karry Taylor recently spoke with Rubin and Suzuki on the Calgary stop of their tour. Although drivers may not see any up- side to higher fuel prices, as an econo-mist and an ecologist, what benefits do each of you see? Rubin: The consequences of higher fuel prices are that we are not going to be able to grow at the same rate. The caveat being, of course, that in Alberta's case, it's the opposite \u2014 higher fuel prices benefit Alberta. But for the rest of the world, triple digit oil prices are very problematic. Eighty per cent of the fuel that drives GDP is oil, coal and natural gas. So when you stop growing, whether its your intention or not, you stop emitting. But I guess the question is, if we couldn't get our act together to put a meaningful price on carbon when the economy was growing, what do you rate our chances of doing that when our economy stops growing? The silver lining here is we're not going to have to do anything, because the very process of not growing is going to lighten our carbon footprint, whether we intend to or not. Suzuki: Higher oil prices are a good thing. I wish that we had taken advantage of the fact that we have brains, and that we could have used our brains and managed our way to that kind of steady state. This provides us with a crisis \u2014 and it's a mul - tiple crisis. It's an economic crisis because all of our thinking is that if the economy isn't growing, we are in deep trouble. But we are also facing an ecological crisis \u2014 which is the amount of carbon that we are putting in the atmosphere. So, I think that if Jeff's thesis is right, this is the moment to start thinking hard about where we are going into the future. How aware are Canadians of the inter- play between the economy and the environment? Rubin: The reason they are called 'man-made emissions' is that we are putting it out there. But we don't want to hear that. We want to hear 'green econ- omy. ' We want to paint everything green and we want to pretend that we can continue to consume as much energy as we have in the past, with wind and solar. And guess what? It's bullshit. We can get energy from wind and solar but it faces constraints similar to oil. I am an economist, so prices are my religion. I believe that prices determine human behavior. Triple digit oil prices are going to lead us to some very green places \u2014 whether we have that as our goal or not. But who cares what our goal is? What really matters is where we are going. Suzuki : We seem to be going from denial, without any kind of acceptance that it is happening and looking at what do we might do about it, to simply crisis and depression and saying, 'its too late. ' Wind power is now competitive with oil. It doesn't need any subsidies \u2014 windmills will pay for themselves. Solar power is coming very rapidly. But the reality is that oil is a very special source of energy and it's going to be very hard to replace it. We can have all of our electricity, I believe, gener - ated by renewables. But the challenge is renewable energy requires strength of will. Given Canada's geographic size and population density, how realistic \u2014 and how fair \u2014 is it to expect things like mass public transit systems such as trains to replace automobiles? Suzuki: Well it's a problem. It might be possible to economically justify between Edmonton, Red Deer and Calgary. But there generally aren't the population concentrations needed, certainly, for inner-city travel. But our cities haven't been designed in the right way. You look at Calgary \u2014 the sprawl here is sick - ening. There has been no attempt to create com - munities as the city sprawls out. Every block should have a grocery store \u2014 things like that is what cre - ates community. But we have badly designed our cities \u2014 everything is in the service of cars. The concentration of people in Europe is greater, and that is why they are confronting these chal - lenges and opportunities. They don't have the re - sources that we have and they don't have as much spaced \u2014 so they are having to confront climate change and having to actually do something about it much quicker than we are here.

Now, new technology means that the city may be chang - ing those streetlight bulbs again, this time t o LEDs \u2014 a move that could mean a large expenditure for taxpayers. Currently, the city is only looking at a phased approach to installing the LED streetlights using existing bud - geted funds. But City Council has also requested a comprehensive imple - mentation plan for 2015 to 2017. The switch is taking place against the backdrop of a recent Calgary Transportation Report that con - cluded, \"Replacement of standard high pr essure sodium streetlights with LED streetlights where feasible can provide an overall economic and environmental benefit to the City of Calgary. \" Cities such as Edmonton, Hamilton, Halifax and Fredericton, as well as cit - ies in the United States and abroad, have conducted similar investigations that have reached similar conclusions. LEDs, which stand for Light Emit - ting Diodes, use less energy over a longer life span than traditional lighting sources. Each lamp contains more than 80 tiny bulbs, which have a life span of 60,000 hours or around 16 years when lit for 10 hours each day \u2014 five times that of a traditional street lamp. So far, the appearance of LED lights on Calgary's streets has been limited to a one-year pilot test pro - gram in the community of Brent - wood, which concluded in February 2012. City spokesperson Kelly Dyer said citizen feedback on that project was generally neutral, although there were some complaints about the quality of the light. LEDs are known to shine with a whiter light than the blue light of the earlier streetlights and individuals may prefer one tone to the other. Dyer said a pilot project was nec - essary, despite the earlier studies, since each city has its \"own unique infrastructure\" and \"spacing of lights. \" She also noted the City does not \"take the philosophy that what works in one city will work in an - other. \" At that time of the earlier switch to EnviroSmart fixtures, the admin- istration touted reduced energy consumption and the resultant sav - ings and estimated the city would regain the cost of installing the new fixtures from energy savings by 2011 or 2012. Dyer said the estimated cost to replace just 19,500 of the 90,000 streetlights in the city with LED lights is in the area of $23.7-million. A ten-year implementation plan is likely to be undertaken if the city decides to go ahead with the street - light replacements. Leotek, an American company specializing in LED lighting, has said the key downside to conversion is the significant capital outlay as LED lights are two to four times more ex - pensive than traditional lights.Leotek also said that programs where paybacks exceed 10 years should normally be deferred for economic reasons \u2014 but it notes that many municipalities proceed, despite very long financial payback periods, to address climate change considerations. The estimated average annual op - erating costs savings would be $65 per fixture. The Calgary report esti- mates the costs of installing LEDs will be recouped after 15 years.

Ca a PR 2013 17FAMILY LIFe cALg A r Yjourn AL. cA APR 2013 18prec Ious sn Apshots Photos of brief lives, taken with love Briella Gonsalves's life was very brief. But it was a life full of love. Born on Jan. 16, 2013, she suffered from trisomy 13, a genetic disorder. Unsure how long their daughter would survive, Briella's parents arranged for a Catholic baptism and confirmation ceremony to be held in the operating room. She was later introduced to her grandparents and uncle, and to Tobie, her 18-month-old sister. Seventeen hours after her birth, Briella passed away peacefully in her mother's arms. Her parents, Rock Gonsalves and Heidi Schmaltz, say that they take comfort in having accomplished all the goals they had for their daughter's short life \u2014 namely that Briella was kept comfortable and felt surrounded by the love of her family. Gonsalves and Schmaltz had a professional pho - tographer record their daughter's brief life. The photographer was from Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep \u2014 a non-profit organization that offers parents facing the loss of an infant the opportunity to receive free professional portraits of their child. Schmaltz says that the photographs are a \"gift\" that her family will cherish forever. PHOTOGRAPHS A BLESSING FOR FAMILY Twelve weeks into Schmaltz's pregnancy, she and Gonsalves were told there was a high possibility that Briella would be stillborn. Given their daughter's prognosis, they began working with a pediatric palliative care team, which provides care for children, including those not yet born, with life-threatening conditions. It was through the team's grief counsellor that they first heard of Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep. Photographer Elizabeth Crammer, one of 11 local photographers who volunteer with the organiza - tion, spent six hours with the family to help capture their time with Briella. Schmaltz says that Crammer's photographs \u2014 as well as her presence \u2014 proved to be \"a blessing. \" \"Elizabeth was amazing, \" Schmaltz says. \"She was willing to be there the entire day. She's just a very loving person. \" The family knew ahead of time that Briella's condition would affect her face and her appear -ance. She was also very tiny, weighing less than four pounds. Schmaltz says that Crammer's kind and gentle manner with Briella helped the family throughout the day. \"Even though I had already had a baby, it kind of surprised me how different it was and how awk - ward I felt, \" Schmaltz says. \"But Elizabeth was just so easy and comfortable and loving with Brie. \"She helped me feel more comfortable. \" ORGANIZATION'S FOUNDINGNow I Lay Me Down to Sleep began with the birth of Cheryl Haggard's fourth child, Maddux, on Feb. 4, 2005. Born with a condition called myotubular my - opathy, he was unable to breathe, swallow or move. Six days after his birth, Haggard and her husband made the difficult decision to disconnect Maddux from life support. With their Colorado home decorated with por - traits of their older children, Haggard says she and her husband wanted to ensure that Maddux would have a place among the photos of his siblings. After initially taking photographs of Maddux herself, Haggard eventually called in professional photographer Sandy Puc, a specialist in infant and family photography. \"I wanted photos while he was on his life sup - port \u2014 how we knew him for those six days, \" Hag- gard says. \"But I also wanted more intimate pictures where I could hold him skin-on-skin. \" Haggard asked Puc if she would be willing to take more photos after Maddux had been disconnected from the life support equipment. \"And bless her heart, Sandy agreed to, \" Haggard says. \"Those images mean everything to me. \" Touched by the tenderness that Puc had shown in photographing Maddux \u2014 and realizing the im - pact that the photographs had on her family dur - ing their grieving process \u2014 Haggard says that she wanted to share her story to let all parents facing a similar loss know that it was okay to have por - traits done. Puc agreed to offer her services free- of-charge to other bereaved parents in the Denver area. Within a month of Maddux's passing, approval for a non-profit organization was secured and Hag - gard, along with four others, started Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep. The organization's first official photography ses - sion took place two months later. Within two years, almost 3,000 professional pho - tographers had signed on as volunteers and the organization was able to hire an executive director and office staff. Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep currently has nearly 13,000 volunteer photographers in about 40 coun- tries worldwide, including about 125 in Canada. Haggard wanted to ensure that parents facing the loss of an infant who wanted professional pho - tographs of their child are not hindered by financial circumstances. Parents are provided with a disc of touched-up images free-of-charge. A mother's love: Heidi Schmaltz and nme RKArrY tA YL or kta ylor@cjournal.caNon-profit organization, volunteer photographers strive to help families healFAMILY LIF e cALg A r Yjourn AL. cA APR 2013 19\"I never wanted a parent to think, 'I can't afford to hire a professional photographer, '\" she says. \"Sadly there is a need for this service \u2014 there is only one chance to capture, on film, the connection between the parents and their child. \"There is no tomorrow with that child. \" The need for the service is not uncommon, says Krista Fuller, the organization's parent co-ordinator for Calgary. Fuller says she takes an average of two calls per month requesting a photographer. The exact number of Calgary-area families re - questing the service is difficult to measure because sometimes parents or hospital staff will contact photographers directly, but Fuller says, on rare oc - casions she has had up to three calls in one day. PHOTOGRAPHS COMFORT PARENTS Like Haggard, the organization's Colorado-based CEO Gina Harris knows first-hand the importance the photographs have for grieving parents. Harris first learned about the service in 2007 when she was faced with losing her unborn son David to a rare condition called Potter's syndrome. David passed away at birth. Sandy Puc took photographs of him with his parents. Told that she could go on and have a healthy baby, Harris became pregnant again less than a year later. Her second son \u2014 whom the Harrises had named Ethan \u2014 developed a condition called hy - drops and cystic hygromas, which is severe swelling and fluid buildup around the organs. Harris carried Ethan for 24 weeks before losing him. Given the severity of his condition, his parents decided not to have photographs done. \"Going through the loss of two babies, having photographs of one of our sons and not the other really made a difference in our grieving process, \" Harris says. \"Having photographs of David, there is more of a memory of him. The pictures say 'he was real, he was my baby and I held him. ' \"We didn't get that with Ethan. \" PHOTOGRAPHERS CALLED 'HEROES' Haggard says the volunteer photographers are the \"heart and soul\" of Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep. \"They are angels with cameras, \" she says. \"They go into situations not knowing what to expect. \"No situation or family is exactly the same \u2014 ev - ery family's grief process is totally different. \" Harris says that the photographers are her he - roes and that the organization would not exist without them. \"Any type of volunteer service is commendable, \" Harris says. \"But to be a volunteer photographer for Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep is one of the most dif - ficult volunteer positions that I know about. \"Walking into a hospital room with a family who is in immense grief and who has just lost a baby is a very emotional thing. \"They are able to use their talent and their pas- sion for photography to give the only gift they can to a parent who is losing an infant, \" Harris says. VOLUNTEER AIMS TO HELP OTHERS Calgary photographer Jody Crane says she be - came involved with the organization as a way to offer community service through her photogra- phy. Crane works with the families to ensure that the photos will be personal and intimate. \"Sometimes we will take pictures with a special blanket that was knit for the infant, or with a spe - cial bracelet that both mom and baby have \u2014 the little touches like that can help, \" Crane says. There is also a personal motivation behind Crane's involvement. Her own sister lost a baby girl. \"It was quite difficult because it was also my loved one \u2014 but it really showed me what effect the photos can have for a family, \" says Crane. KEEPING MEMORIES ALIVE \"It's a little bit of Brie, \" Schmaltz says. \"She was here such a short time. Sometimes it seems like it was just a dream. \"We can now look back on those photos and that will help keep her with us for a lot longer. \" Schmaltz treasures the links the photos provide between Tobie and her sister. \"At 18 months old, Tobie will have an emotional imprint of this time, but the concrete memories will probably fade, \" Schmaltz says. \"We will be able to let her see that she met her sister, and that she got to hold Brie. \" Schmaltz adds that the photographs were a par - ticular comfort for Gonsalves, who had less time with his daughter and was not present when she passed away. \"One of the gifts of those photos was, looking back on them, he didn't even remember some of the photos that were taken with him holding Brie, \" Schmaltz says. \"It was a real comfort for him because he was able to look at those photos and say, 'Yeah, she really did know that I loved her. '\" THE RIPPLE EFFECT At a celebration of Briella's life \u2014 held a week after she passed away \u2014 her parents showed a slide - show of the photographs taken by Crammer and reflected upon what their daughter's brief life had meant to them. Schmaltz says that an email, written by the fam - ily and containing a brief story about Briella and a handful of Crammer's photographs, drew numer - ous responses \u2014 including many from strangers who had received it second- or third-hand. The family has been inspired by stories of peo - ple doing things in Briella's name, such as making charitable donations to Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep. 'The ripple effect has been kind of amazing, \" Schmaltz says. \"I don't totally understand it, but it's also a gift to see the effect that Brie has on people. \" Stats Canada calculates the infant mortality rate as the number of deaths of children underone year old per 1,000 live births of the same year. infog RAP hic by D An mA cKenzie / c A lg AR y jou R n A l Father and daughter: Rock andBriella Gonsalves.

Selling things online is by no means a new phenomenon, but it is something to keep in mind this time of year when sorting through piles of needless items. It seems simple. But the truth is, the majority of us have no idea where to start. WHAT'S HOLDING US BACK? The first step is deciding to sell. Suba Lyer, a California-based writer for finance blog WealthInformatics.com, says most of us \"are guilty of keeping those things that we think we will use and never do. \" She says the lack of urgency or immediate need for money could be a factor in why sorting and sell - ing is low priority. Lyer's situation was much different. An earth - quake warning in her residential area was the mo - tivation she needed to start. She sold her things to make a quick $2,000 emergency fund. \"Once I got started and created a system, I was able to make the money I needed, \" Lyer says. Although Lyer is no longer in a scramble for money, she still uses her easy selling system to get rid of items to bring in an extra $300 to $400 into the household each month. It sounds too easy, a moneymaking system that turns cleaning into cash, but Lyer says it all starts with \"a good organization strategy before listing to sell. \" THE SORTING PROCESS \"The best advice I can give is to sell a bunch of things at once, \" says Courtney Baker, from Man - VsDebt.com \u2014 a blog focused on making money from your clutter. \"You'd think it'd be easier to find one thing and go through the process of selling it \u2014 but it's much more time consuming and discouraging that way, \" she says. Baker considers herself a \"well-oiled machine\" when it comes to \"selling crap. \" Like Lyer, the Baker family's situation is among the extremes \u2014 they liquidated almost everything they owned to pay off a massive debt. However, Baker says it has allowed her to become an expert on the topic. \"Whether you are looking to completely clear out your household and start from scratch like we did, or make a couple of bucks cleaning a closet, there is a definite way to go about things, \" Baker says. She recommends having a designated work - space so the project doesn't disrupt living space. \"For us, it was the garage. We brought things in there to sort, photograph, list and sell. It also al - lowed us to work without distractions, \" she says. Baker breaks down the sorting pro - cess into phases and says it be - comes easier with each transition. \"The first phase is surface level. Walk through the house and grab everything that's either in the way or you know you don't use, \" she says. The next step is thought to be harder. \"This is when you are actually required to sort through things and decide if they are of use, \" Baker says. \"It can take a few weeks depending on how big your house is, and how much you are looking to get rid of. \" However, Baker insists this step be done room- by-room: take items that can be sold to the work - space, sort into listing piles by item type, then photograph and list. THE SELLING PROCESS Baker says a great way to gain momentum is by selling an item at the beginning of the process. This can be accomplished in the first phase, selling the big obvious things that are in the way \u2014 like that desk you've been storing and never use. \"Furniture usually sells the easiest, and it's en - couraging to list something and see it sell, \" she says. Once you've gone through a whole room, Baker says to line up the items and sort based on cat - egory or website, because specific items sell best on certain websites. Learning these tricks of the trade comes with time, but Baker says she's found it best to sell elec - tronics on eBay, furniture on Craigslist or Kijiji, and books on Amazon. However, she recommends Craigslist for inexpe - rienced online sellers, saying it is the most \"casual marketplace since a yard sale. \" Baker says she still likes to post items on Craigslist \u2014 even if they are listed on another site \u2014 because \"online marketplaces\" like this allow a local option for those who want to avoid shipping. The most important tip \u2014 which Baker learned the hard way \u2014 is to never agree to hold an item. \"I'll tell someone I have other people waiting to buy, whether I do or don't, \" she says. \"People will feel a sense of urgency to then agree to pick up the item as soon as possible. \" GET IT STARTED Baker urges everyone to get started on \"de-clut - tering for cash. \" While out of debt, Baker and her husband are still sifting through unneeded items every six to eight weeks, as clutter continues to creep into their home. \"It's inevitable that things will build up, and no, you are never going to fully get back what you paid for them, \" she says. \"But it's better to recoup anything you can for your things rather than throw them out or leave them around. \" Can you turn your clutter into cash?

The rural areas within a 70-kilome - tre radius of Calgary boast nine museums and heritage sites. These buildings and their societies have been part of our province for decades, and they con - tinue to serve the community with accounts and artifacts of their past. NEW CONCEPTS, OLD VALUES Located 44 kilometres south of Calgary, the city of Okotoks is full of small-town charm and comfort that can sometimes get lost in a big city. Among the quiet, older part of the city is the Okotoks Museum and Archives, housed in an old Victorian-style house. Inside, the 19th century museum offers an ar - ray of antiques \u2014 from a 1900s washing machine to children's toys. And museum manager Kathy Coutts said their collection is always growing. \"Through the help of our donators we are build - ing a hands-on area in our attic which will serve as an exciting addition to our school program. \" In addition to local school programs, Coutts said the museum does its best to get out into the community with what resources they have. \"It will never stop being important to honour those who came before you and all of the de - termination and hard work they gave to make Okotoks what it is. And that's why we're here, \" Coutts said. However, the museum sees a cycle of success and struggle all too often. \"We faced a big hit. The federal government eliminated a major program that we traditionally had accessed funds for, \" Coutts said. \"We've had to readjust our priorities based on the changing grants, or the reduction of grants. That is never easy. \" The funding that Coutts referred to is operated through several provincial and federal govern - ment programs. It is designed to restore and pre - serve Alberta's history. In addition to being able to apply for project-based funding, museums can also apply for numerous restorative and other up-keep grants. TURNING TO THE COMMUNITY To combat this sometimes unstable financial fu - ture, some museums, like Airdrie's Nose Creek Valley Museum, charge a small admission fee. Laurie Harvey, the museum's curator, said they also have two meeting rooms that are rented out to bring in additional monthly revenue. However, Harvey understands the museum image needs to adapt to the future and to the needs of the community. \"People's perceptions of museums as boring places where old things go to die needs to be changed, so we are doing the best we can to do that, \" she said. \"It is hard to see where you're going if you don't know where you came from, \" Harvey said. Harvey is trying to make learning about the past fun with a new tool for local schools. \"We now offer kits that schools can come and pick up to take to the classroom. They can also ask for the curator to come talk to them, \" she said. \"We are adapting as we see fit and I think it's producing great outcomes. \" FUTURE PLANS TO ENTICE VISTORS Only 40 kilometres further north is another unique and interesting heritage site, the Roulston Museum in Carstairs. Built as an addition onto an old Presbyterian church, this museum and its so - ciety were born out of a desire to preserve. \"They wanted to see something happen to the church rather than it just getting demolished. So the historical society was formed and the church was given over to us, \" said Michael Dougherty, the museum's manager. Dougherty said the museum is currently go - ing through a transformation to help tell a more regional story. \"We are re-developing our south galley, which will tell of the Calgary-Edmonton wagon trail and how that impacted the expansion between Cal- gary and Red Deer, Red Deer and Edmonton. \" Revenue to fund this new project will be ac - cessed through a number of streams, including community and corporate sponsorship as well as municipal and provincial funding from the Alber - ta Museums Association (AMA), Dougherty said. \"The AMA offers a range of services, products, and grants to museums across Alberta, \" said Mat - thew Wangler, executive director of the provin - cial Historic Resources Management branch. And even if museums don't apply for some of the Alberta Museums Association's grants, the Alberta Historical Resource Foundation (AHRF) is there to pick up the slack, he said. \"The direct funding the AHRF provides to sm- museums assists them with projects that are not eligible for funding through AMA grant pro - grams. \" However, with so much learning potential, it may come as a surprise to know that many Cal- garians do not know about small town museums. \"I'm amazed that there are so many (museums) so close to us that I didn't even know about, \" sin - gle father Blake Desson said of the culture-rich rural areas of Alberta. \"Now that I know, I will definitely take my kids out there. We are always looking for things to do once they are out of school, \" Desson said.

Estimated at 150 pairs, his collection includes Nike, Jordan, Adidas, Puma and Reebok. Costing from $100 to $250 per pair, the total retail value of his collection is about $30,000. \"Growing up as a kid, I always travelled to the States with my parents. Buying sneakers from a dif - ferent country was always my thing, \" Meja said. He added that he always wanted to have the sneakers that nobody else had. Even with his whopping selection, he doesn't wear all of his shoes \u2014 like his Nike Air Yeezy 1 de - signed by Kanye West. He's had them for about four years and they stay fresh in the shoebox. With the hopes of expanding the sneaker com - munity in Calgary, Mejia and three other friends created YYC SOLEmates. It is a Facebook group with 269 members where other sneaker lovers connect to share pictures and sell or exchange shoes. Rupert Garcia, a friend and member of YYC SOLEmates, said one of the benefits of the group is the open communication available amongst the members. Many often post questions asking any - thing sneaker-related \u2014 whether it's about which specific pairs are better for a certain sports or par - ticular weather, or the life duration of certain sneak - ers. Garcia also said he has had the opportunity to meet other people with similar interests through the Facebook group. The YYC SOLEmates page is also where Mejia presents his talent on shoe restorations \u2014 a hob - by he picked up since beginning his collection. \"I buy a lot of sneakers that are used, \" Mejia said. \"A lot of people think that the sneak - ers they sell me are lifeless. \"But I enjoy the cleaning part, the painting and seeing what the finished product is at the end. \" Garcia has been a long-term client of Mejia's for about eight years. He said that it's great Me - jia picked up this hobby, because he doesn't know of any other options for shoe restorations in Calgary. Though his collection isn't as large as Mejia's, Garcia's love for sneakers branches off from his love of basketball - just like Mejia. Mejia started collecting at 13 years old, and he hasn't stopped since. He said he started learning more about the sneaker culture when he played basketball in junior high \u2014 learning through magazines and books before the onset of his online research. \"Sneakers have always been my thing, \" Mejia said. Quite a few of Mejia's pairs are limited editions and some of them he had to patiently wait for. \"My cousin and I slept in front of a store for 11 hours to grab a pair of Air Jordan 1 - the very first pair Michael Jordan wore in the NBA, \" he said. Mejia's love for sneakers transcends his overall fashion sense. Mejia owns Legal Hustle Clothing, a company where some of the apparel designs are influenced by sneakers.

Trinidad and Tobago isn't exactly a global hothouse for fashion design either, yet that's where Anya Ayoung Chee, winner of Project Run-way Season 9, hails from. She launched her first collection, Pilar by Anya in 2009. In an interview with the Calgary Journal, Ayoung Chee, dished about how she achieved success as a designer and what young designers can do to follow in her footsteps \u2014 even if they aren't from New York or Paris. Tell me about how you first came to be interested in fashion. I originally studied graphic design but really wanted to do fashion. I think I kind of chickened out. I car - ried on doing graphic design until my brother died in 2007. I went back home to be with my family, and I was kind of lost. I decided to enter Miss Trinidad and Tobago \u2014 to eventually go on to Miss Uni - verse. When I did Miss Universe, one of the things I got to do was design some of my wardrobe. That's what really peaked my interest in doing fashion as a career. I always loved it and when I look back now, I realize it was my calling. Tell me about some of the difficulties and doubts you've had along the way. I had a lot of doubts! I didn't know how I was going to be received, I didn't know if people would think \"well she's not really a fashion designer, who does she think she is?\" Designing in a small society is challenging because people are always quick to criticize and judge. In some ways, I already knew I was doing it for myself. I wasn't that afraid of its success outside of whether or not I thought it was good. That relinquished a lot of pressure for me. You're from a small island in the Ca- ribbean. How did that make fashion designing more difficult?If it wasn't for Project Runway, I wouldn't be in the position I am in now. It's definitely challenging. I don't think it has to do with coming from Trinidad. But it definitely has to do with not being born into a certain network of people or a place related to the industry. I've had to cultivate a lot of relationships. How did you come to compete in Proj- ect Runway? I happened to see a tweet early in 2011 that said applications were being accepted. I figured \"what do I have to lose?\" so I applied. I came and did a few rounds of auditions, and each time, I couldn't really believe it was happening. I really thought when I got there for the final audition, which was the first episode, that would have been it. I never anticipated that I would get to the second episode, far less to win. What was the experience like? It was amazing! I never went to fashion school and it really showed me that when you focus, it bares fruit. Also, the camaraderie of the other designers \u2014 I was really impressed that on a competition show we became friends. It was amazing to see a show of that level be produced. It was a privilege to be amongst all the talented people who came together to make the show.What impact did winning Project Runway have on your success as a designer? It really opened doors that would not have been opened otherwise in the fashion industry. It has given me the opportunity to actually have what I wanted, which is a global fashion brand. Given all your experiences, what ad- vice would you have for young fashion designers looking to break into the industry? Maintain your individuality, because nothing is going to differentiate you in a pool of all of these people trying to do the same thing except your own voice \u2014 plus your dedication and focus. Trust yourself, and also realize any dream you want can come true. What's in your future? If anybody had asked me five years ago what my future would be like today, there is no way I could have said this. I've always wanted to be the Caribbean brand that is accepted glob - ally. I have a deep passion for representing T rinidad and taking our culture into the world. My work has always been in some ways linked to how do I give back, what is the bigger purpose of my work and how can I influence my home in a positive way.

In the mid-1950s, Locke's parents bought the paint - ing from artist Jim Nicholl. Nicholl and his wife Marion, also an artist, had a studio on Bowness Road, across the street from the home of Locke's grandmother. The couple was selling their artwork to raise money for Marion to travel to New York to study art and modernism. Locke, now an attorney and conservationist, grew up with the painting hanging in his family's home. He says that it depicts what he fondly remembers as the Calgary of his childhood. \"It's perfect. Jim Nicholl captured the light and the cold of downtown Calgary, \" Locke says. \"When you grow up in Calgary and then later travel to other places, you begin to realize that the light else - where isn't the same. \" Locke's father gave him the painting in the early '80s. Locke says the painting has been with him in every city he has lived in since. \"It's always gives me a sense of home \u2014 I love this painting. \" Calgarians now have the chance to see the paint - ing. Locke has loaned the piece to the Glenbow mu- seum for a new exhibit. Made In Calgary: The 1960s showcases the artistic and cultural changes the city witnessed during the course of the decade. The exhibition is the first installment of a year-long celebration of artists who have lived and worked Calgary over the last 50 years. Four other exhibitions, each focusing on a success decade, will debut later. DECADE-BY-DECADE LOOK AT ART IN CALGARY Mary Beth LaViolette, the curator who put the exhibit together, says that while the Glenbow has held ret - rospectives before, this is the first time that there has been a decade-by-decade show. Organized into three separate themes \u2014 friends and colleagues, newcomers and couples \u2014 Made in Calgary: The 1960s, surveys the city through paintings, original prints, sculpture, ceramics and textile art cre - ated by local artists during the decade. LaViolette says that the exhibit provides insight into how \"active and energetic\" the arts community was in Calgary during the 1960s. \"It was an art community that was interested in what was going on in the larger art world, \" LaViolette says. This installment includes art work drawn from the Glenbow's collection and other public collections, such as the Alberta Foundation for the Arts and the Nickle Arts Museum. Several pieces, such as Locke's painting, have been loaned by private collectors. ART IN ALBERTA COMES OF AGE Les Graff, a 1959 graduate of the Alberta College of Art and Design, says that prior to the 1960s, Alberta tended to be very \"regional\" when it came to art \u2014 with most of the emphasis on local subject matter such as paintings of mountains. \"There was an idea of what art in Alberta was all about, but it was a very dated idea, \" says Graff, who worked with the province's Visual Arts branch for over 30 years. The 1960s installment at the Glenbow, Graff says, will be showcasing artists who \"suddenly got in step with the 20th century and started to do things dif - ferently. \" This shift in the art scene of Alberta began when students and instructors from Alberta College of Art started going outside the province to study under well-known artists in the United States, Europe and Mexico. Graff himself studied in Michigan. \"They came back to Calgary with new ideas, \" Graff says. \"Instructors also came into the province when there was an increase in the number of students, but not enough local instructors with qualifications. \"That added a whole new dimension to the art in- struction being available within the province. This change was coupled with a general growing interest in art in all parts of Alberta \u2014 what Graff calls a \"grassroots\" movement. \"People were taking painting classes and learning ceramics and how to weave, \" Graff says. \"There was increasing enrollment at every level, and so there was a tremendous expansion of ideas. \" Made in Calgary: The 1960s runs until April 28. The next installment in the series, dealing with the city's art scene in the 70s, will open in May.SwIngIn '60 S Made In Calgary: The 1960s aims to showcase both the artistic and social landscape of the city.

The Expo has hosted some big names over the few years it has been running, from the entire cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation to Spiderman creator Stan Lee who is returning for an encore appearance. This year they're adding Yankovic to its numbers, complete with a concert the opening night of the Expo at the Saddledome. Having got his start on the syndi - cated Dr. Demento radio show when he was a teenager, Yankovic made his name in the entertainment industry with his infamous song parodies, such as \"Dare to Be Stupid\" and \"Like A Surgeon. \" The Calgary Journal had a chance to talk to Weird Al over the phone as he prepares to come to Cal- gary for his concert on April 26. What are you looking for - ward to at the Calgary Comic and Entertainment Expo?I'm looking forward to doing the live show. That's always a lot of fun, and I think there's going to be a lot of crazy fans there. We haven't done a live show in Canada for this tour. We shot our concert special in Toronto, but aside from that we haven't done a whole lot of dates in Canada, so we're looking forward to coming up there. Why is a pop culture icon like yourself coming to this kind of expo?Well it's just kind of how these comic book conventions are expanding. I was influenced a lot by comic books growing up, like Mad Magazine really informed my sensibility growing up. I would scavenge used book stores and magazine stores to find back is - sues and I was really obsessed with it. And it was that sensibility that really guided my own warped sense of hu-mor. Some of your songs are just so silly, like Bedrock Anthem and Amish Paradise. What is it you find funny about these songs? (Laughs) Well I try not to dissect hu - mor because once you really analyze humor it takes away the joke. So I don't know why funny stuff is funny, I think surprises are a big part of com -edy \u2014 taking a left turn unexpect - edly. I think you'll find there's a lot of randomness in my lyrics. Humor is very subjective; what's funny to some people isn't funny to others, so I never try to write like that. I write to amuse myself and hope that other people are as warped as I am. Can you recall that moment when making people laugh was something you knew you wanted to do? Well I've always liked making peo - ple laugh, even as a kid. But I never thought I'd make a living off it. In my college days I thought I'd be an architect but sometime around my junior year I realized that wasn't how I was going to spend my life, I found out that I was at best average, pos - sibly even mediocre at my architec - ture skills. It wasn't something that I really enjoyed, the stuff that made me happy was going on the Campus radio station every Saturday night for three hours and doing the Weird Al show and playing all sorts of fun - ny music and just acting stupid on the air. I thought gosh, wouldn't it be great if I could make a living off doing something like that? So now about 40 years lat - er, what do you think makes your songs so popular?I don't know, I mean they're osten- sibly silly and ridiculous, but there's still some craft there. I pay atten - tion. I've had the same band for thirty years and they're all amazing musicians.

Fulfilling our fate, we are heeding the call. \" The lyric from Swedish metal band HammerFall could be a Facebook status update for a the Calgary-based heavy music group Chron Goblin. Out of thousands of applicants, Chron Goblin won an opportunity to play at the second annual DesertFest 2013 \u2014 an underground rock festival that will be held in Camden, a historical rock and roll suburb of London, England. The festival takes place in late April. \"We never expected we would actually win, \" says drummer Brett Whittingham. \"We are still in shock we were selected, and are extremely excited about this opportunity to play our first show in the U.K. \" The band mates met in 2009 at Rundle Hall, a stu-dent residence at the University of Calgary. A couple years later, during a night of beer drink - ing and a casual jam session, Whittingham, guitar - ist Devin \"Darty\" Purdy and vocalist Josh Sandulak joined forces to create Chron Goblin. Shortly after, long-time friend Richard Hepp was recruited to play bass. The band began writing lyrics, rehears-ing and playing shows. Their gritty, guitar-heavy sound is influenced by acts like Black Sabbath, Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age. Whittington said that while tour - ing western Canada last year, the positive reaction from fans that inspired the band to enter the com- petition. They are thrilled to give Europe a taste of heavy metal music born here in Alberta. Chron Goblin submitted songs, photos and their latest video, \"Bring Your Idols. \" \"To be selected out of bands from around the world and to have the opportunity to play with artists we respect is a dream come true, \" Whit - tingham says. The pressure to stand out amongst so many talented musicians is difficult. Whittingham says forming a unique sound does not come easy. \"Songwriting can be very challenging. We try to never write the same song twice, \" he says. \"There's a plethora of bands and artists that we look up to. We are motivated by their music to create our own addition to rock and roll. \" The band's reviews in Calgary have been mixed. Music critic Jimmy Deen Caterine states: \"You can feel the passion and my guess is they perform well in front of an audience. But there is definitely some wood shedding that needs to be done to further hone their craft. \" Writing in Calgary music magazine BeatRoute, Lori Meyers called Chron Goblin \"a force to be reck - oned with. Each song crescendos into screaming fits, blasting out of once-slow jams. Chron Goblin is a great recipe for madness: a bunch of rock, a pinch of hardcore and one fat doobie. Vocalist Josh Sandulak ran from side to side possessed, eating his microphone and spewing out lyrics at mach ten. \" Whether the critics like them or not, the band's ability to be recognized is undeniable. They con-tinue to grow as artists, and credit their ability to collaborate. \"Our style has evolved so much in the last four years and we've all grown as musicians. That con - tinuously makes being in a band exciting, espe - cially when we play a great show. \" Whittingham says. \"We are all fortunate enough to have built a strong friendship before we started writing. \" Bandmates (from left) Brett Whittingham, Josh Sandulak, Devin Richard Hepp play at DesertFest 2013.

It keeps you out of trou - ble and keeps you in good shape, \" Euren says. \"Its not about winning or losing. It's about having fun \u2014 and going out and giving it your all. \" Euren, currently a Grade 11 student at Father Lacombe, recently took part in the Calgary Senior High School Athletic Association wrestling cham- pionships. Competing against 24 others in a highly competitive 65-kg weight class, he placed second. At the provincial championships a week later, he wrestled his way to third place in a field of 16. The sport has a long tradition in his family. Euren has been involved in the sport for seven years. In addition to his school team, he wrestles with the Calgary Jr. Rebels \u2014 a community club based out of Jack James High School. His older brother Randy also competed for many years and now coaches the sport. The two brothers were drawn to the sport by their father. Douglas Euren rarely missed a wrestling prac - tice, and never missed a tournament that involved George or Randy. Douglas Euren passed away sud - denly on Dec. 22, 2012. He was 42 years old. LOSS FEL T BY WRESTLING COMMUNITY Russ Mendonca, the head coach of the Rebels, says that the loss was felt deeply throughout Calgary's wrestling community. \"Doug was just an incredible person. We miss him dearly, \" Mendonca says. \"It's hard to imagine what it is like for George, because it was hard for all of us. \" Helen Colbourne, a teacher and wrestling coach at Forest Lawn High School, says that she also feels the absence of Douglas at city wrestling events. \"You could always count on his dad to be there in support \u2014 Doug was always a happy and positive person, \" Colbourne says. RETURN TO COMPETITION Euren has decided to return to competing. Mendonca says it hasn't been easy because ev - erything connected to the sport reminds Euren of his father. Keith Daye, a teacher and wrestling coach at Forest Lawn High School, says that the first high school wrestling tournament of 2013 \u2014 held at the beginning of February \u2014 was particularly difficult for everybody. \"We hosted the first tournament, and I was hav - ing a hard time getting through it, \" Daye says. \"I kept looking at George's corner and there was a void there. \" \"I remember saying to George, \"It's just a wres- tling match \u2014 you can't be carrying everything else with you in terms of expectations. \" Euren won his weight class and was voted the most outstanding wrestler of that tournament. Daye says that he was so overcome with emotion that he had a hard time announcing the award results. COACH PRAISES 'HEART AND SOUL' Mendonca meanwhile says that Euren, who also competes in lacrosse, is an natural athlete and an excellent wrestler. \"He's incredibly strong and has a great work ethic, \" Mendonca says. But Mendonca also says Euren's contribution to the club goes far beyond his performance on the wrestling mat. \"He brings leadership and a very positive at - titude, \" Mendonca says of the 17-year-old. \"He drives everybody in the room to move forward and excel. \"He expects that from himself, and others. He's a pleasure to have in our club. \" GIVING BACK Following in the footsteps of his brother, Euren has started to transition into the coaching side of wrestling. Daye says that few high school wrestlers give back to the sport the way the Euren brothers do. \"George is not even done competing yet, and he is already involved with coaching, \" Daye says. For his part, George Euren says that he enjoys the coaching side of things. Although he does admits that it puts him in somewhat awkward position due to the fact that he is so young and also helping to coach his teammates. Coaching, Euren says, has given him another view of the sport. He says that wrestling \u2014 from both a coaching and athletic standpoint \u2014 helps instill communication skills and respect for oth-ers. \"Whether you win or lose, you shake the hands of your opponents, the referees and the coaches, \" Euren says. \"It's a good way for everybody to gain respect from you, and for you. \"If you lose a match, you lose \u2014 everybody has their bad days, \" Euren says. \"Everybody loses sometimes. \" Mendonca says the Euren has a bright future, whether it is in wrestling or anything else he de - cides to do.

But, af- ter her strong first season on the World Cup circuit, Chelsea Valois may be add- ing bobsleigh to that list. The former University of Regina track star - who is from the small prairie town of Zenon Park, population roughly 190 \u2014 decided to tryout for the sport this past summer to see if bobsleigh might be for her. A former University of Regina track teammate, who was recruited by Bobsleigh Canada a few years earlier, perked Valois's interest in the sport. Once she recorded good results at a local push camp, the coaches talked her into coming to Cal - gary for the national team tryouts. \"I told myself going into camp, that no matter what, I still had a year of school left and I was going to finish school, \" said Valois. But after her impressive performance at the camp, her plan went out the window. Valois headed to Calgary with one goal \u2014 t o make Olympic and world champion Kaillie Humphries's team. A few weeks later, Humphries and Valois would set off on a record-setting run. They won the first five races of the World Cup season and eight of the 11 races they competed in \u2014 including win - ning the Canadian and World titles. Teammate Humphries said Valois has a lot of potential, and that two athletes complement each other well . \"She allows me to focus because I've got confi - dence in her, and I know that she's going do her job well, \" said Humphries. \"She's really quiet, pretty reserved and mellow, but once she opens up she has some pretty witty things to say. \" Bobsleigh Canada speed and strength coach Quin Sekulich isn't surprised with Valois prog - ress \u2014 because of her previous success as a track athlete. Before bobsleigh, Valois was a successful pen - tathlete, winning the 2011 Canadian Interuni - versity Sport gold medal while at the University of Regina. She also won the schools President's Award - which goes to the student athlete that best combines excellence in sport with academic excellence. Sekulich said that bobsleigh is a sport that track and field athletes typically excel at because the training for both sports are similar. \"When she came into the camp, she put up push numbers that were better then the girls that we had in the program already. So right away she was the number one girl, \" Sekulich said. He went on add that Valois's success was some - what predictable when you combine someone that can push as well as Valois with a pilot such as Humphries. Because of her success this season, the small community of Zenon Park has added a new fea- ture to their roadside: a sign that reads \"Home of bobsleigh world champion Chelsea Valois. \" ian eSPL en iesplen@cjournal .ca Chelsea Valois (left) and Kaillie Humphries smile after receiving their gold medals at the 2012 Canadian Bobsleigh Championships in Calgary this past October.

The Special Olympics was first introduced in the late '60s with the goal of giving people with intellectual disabilities a chance to participate in sport, live healthy lives and make new friends. According to Theresa Garagan, who has been a coach with the Special Olympics for seven years, the event teaches athletes \"life skills, teamwork, independence, and develops new friendships.\" Garagan \u2014 who is also director of the Alber- ta- area, Law Enforcement Torch Run, one of the Special Olympics largest fundraising groups \u2014said she has seen first-hand the value that is add-ed to the lives of the athletes she has coached. While there are a number of success stories Ga- ragan has witnessed in her years of involvement, she does remember one individual in particular who started out timid, shy and quiet. But after being around Garagan and the other police officers at Law Enforcement Torch Run events and being part of the Special Olympics, the girl began to walk with her head up and be-gan giving speeches. \"Her whole self confidence changed from day to night. She was considered a lost soul and she's doing things now that she was told she could never do.\" The Autism Aspergers Friendship Society of Calgary, which was founded by Dean Svoboda in 2004, shares a similar opinion that getting peo-ple with disabilities more socially involved is the best way to combat their disability. Svoboda said, \"Most therapies out there will have an unintentional effect of making people de-valued because they're trying to fix them. Special Olympics and programs like ours that just focus on the recreation and the social world, allow them to be themselves, and that gives them personal value and self-esteem.\" Several people in the AAFSC program are also involved with Special Olympics in some capacity and have been to past games like the ones that will be held April 19-21 in Red Deer. The games will have over 600 coaches and participants and will feature four sports: swim-ming, five-pin bowling, 10-pin bowling and bas-ketball. This is the first time basketball will be in the Alberta Special Olympics. The winners of the games can move on to the national games in Vancouver during the summer of 2014. John Byrne, vice president of sport for Special Olympics Alberta, has seen his share of games during his 14 years of involvement, and recom-mends coming to watch if you are in Red Deer. \"You'll see a huge range of athletic abilities and capabilities. Some of our higher functioning athletes will be pushing some of the most com-petitive times in the province,\" Byrne said. Admission to all the events is free and you can find out more information at specialolympics.ab.ca/2013spring The Special Olympics has noticeably positive effects on many of the atheletes involved.

They weren't sure how well a child born with Down's syndrome would keep up to and fit in with other children. But they agreed to let him try. \"He was one of the first handicapped children to be involved in the program,\" Bob Miles says. Miles learned quickly, though, quickly evapo- rating any doubt that he belonged.This month he will be competing in his fifth provincial competition as a member of the Spe-cial Olympics program \u2014 one he joined 13 years ago in 2000. He rockets from one end of the Inglewood Aquatic Centre's pool to the other during his Wednesday evening practice sessions. When he is not in the water, his distinctive bull- frog bellow booms over the pool, encouraging his teammates. Miles is an accomplished athlete.At the national Special Olympics competition in London, Ontario in 2010, he carried away a total of six medals. He is also a leader on a club, with other talented swimmers. \"We have some excellent swimmers, some who could swim for generic swim clubs,\" says Bob Miles, who joined the club as a coach in 2001. \"That's how good they are.\" The coaches are competitive swimmers and lifeguards who take their athletes very seriously, building success by getting into the water and showing their students how to race. \"Having those competitive swimmers working with them makes a world of difference,\" Bob Miles says. In the spotlight, Miles is shy, giving one-word answers to questions. But in the pool, he is free, a cruising torpedo, ready to give anyone a run for their money \u2014 no matter who they are. Bowlers hope to keep rolling Ian esplen iesplen@cjournal .ca Debbie and Dean Pelletier's biggest obstacle on their path to the Special Olympic glory in Red Deer might not be their competitors. Their biggest obstacle might actually be the Cal-gary transit system. Both Debbie and Dean have to take three buses almost every Saturday in order to join more than 110 friends for an afternoon of fun and Special Olympics bowling at Deerfoot Mall's Bowling De-pot. \"I like it because it's fun and you get to go out on the weekends with your friends,\" said 47-year-old Dean, grinning ear-to-ear. Dean's 46-year-old sister Debbie echoed her brother's comments, and added that the pair of-ten arrive early so they can talk and share a laugh with friends over lunch before bowling. The duo originally started bowling with Special Olympics Calgary more than 20 years ago. \"Our friends were bowling, so we thought we would give it a try,\" Debbie said. Since that day, the pair hasn't thought twice about trying another sport. Because of their ath-letic development over the years, they have com-peted in several games and brought a number of medals back home. When asked what the secret to their success was, Debbie replied, \"You have to relax yourself when you're bowling. If you let others disturb you, you're not going to do well.\" Coach Caroline Rippe, who has coached the sib- lings since 1992, has aided a lot in the Pelletiers' development in the sport. Rippe said that she has never had any problem coaching either one of them, and would describe coaching them as easy because of their positive at-titudes.
