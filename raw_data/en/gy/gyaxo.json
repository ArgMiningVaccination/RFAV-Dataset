Paul, MD Packed with illustrations, stories from Dr. William E. Paul's distinguished career, and compelling narratives of scientific discovery, Immunity presents the three laws of the human immune system\u2014universality, tolerance, and appropriateness\u2014and explains how the system protects and harms us. From the tale of how smallpox was overcome to the lessons of the Ebola epidemic to the utility of vaccines and the hope that the immune system can be used to treat or prevent cancer, Dr. Paul argues that we must position ourselves to take advantage of cutting-edge technologies and promising new tools in immunological research, including big data and the microbiome. \"A treasure trove of information, this wonderful book should broadly appeal to anyone interested in human health and disease. There is no competing volume that covers such breadth of immunology at this personal level. A tour de force.\"\u2014Daniel M. Davis, University of Manchester, author of The Compatibility Gene: How Our Bodies Fight Disease, Attract Others, and Define Our Selves \"Dr. Paul has lived the modern history of basic and applied immunology.
