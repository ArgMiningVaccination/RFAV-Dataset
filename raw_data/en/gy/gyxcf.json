Data were gathered from 45patients intwo age groups: between 33and 39years ofage A11 patients were first-time users ofone oftwo alternative medical centers offering mainly acupunc ture andchiropractic in aWest Coast metropolitan area. Participant -observation, interviews, andquestionnaires were used inthis research. The sample was predominantly female, Caucasian, and middle class. Theliterature onthe general question ofmedical choice inboth developing and industrialized coun tries with pluralistic medical systems was analyzed. Theinteraction offive major classes ofvariables accounted for individual selection among various med ical alternatives. These factors were the symbolic component ofmedicine, perceived physiological aspects oftreatment, type ofdisease, cognitive ofmedical care, andmaterial reasons. Among respondents inthis sample, the single most important class ofvariables inthe decision toseek alternative care was perceived physiological factors, including the desire foreffective treatment and fear ofthe negative side-effects oforthodox medicine. There were few substantial differences between the two age groups inmaking the decision toseek alterna tive care. About 60% described insymptoms after alternative treatment atthe clinics and 40% described moderate orhigh relief oftheir presenting symptoms. About half the sample were generally satisfied with the alternative medical clinic atwhich they received treatment and half were dissatisfied. Eight casestudies are described indetail. The results ofthis study indicate there is a complex relationship between medical beliefs and behavior. Itappears that there isnosharp line in meeting human social and psychological needs between orthodox and alternative medicine. The distinction often made between disease and i11ness does not account for the dynamics ofpatient utilization of a1 ternative medicine.

Americans are increasingly turning tochiropractic, acupuncture, nutrition, biofeedback, meditation, encounter groups, bioenergetics, homeopathy, massage, herbs, and countless other modalities for their health care needs rather than toorthodox medicine, with its therapeutic emphasis ondrugs and surgery. Fordefi nitional purposes, Iwill distinguish medicine States onpurely oper ational criteria. Alternative medicine isanypractice performed by alayman or aprofessional, either a medical doctor or anonphysician, which isconsciously carrried out tomeet some heath care need, preventive orcurative, and which purposely does not use drugs orsurgery, but instead relies onany one ofnumerous other techniques not fully sanctioned bymost and usually regarded bythose using thepractice2 tobemore inharmony with nature. Orthodox medicine, the dominant type ofhealth care inthe United States, isdefined asmedical care delivered by amedical doctor, nurse, dentist, ortrained medical assistant directly under aphysician's supervision and relying oncomplex scientific technology, especially drugs and surgery, regarded as1egitimate bymost physicians. Since there issomuch diversity and disagree - ment on aparadigmatic level within both orthodox and alternative medicine, legitimacy is afar more con sistent criterion fordistinguishing the two types ofmedicine than than the 1arger public, because there issomuch more cognitive variety within the 1atter group. This definition has two important consequences. First, medical be1ief systems become open questions for research ;noautomatic or invariant relationship between belief and behavior isassumed. Moreover, there isnonecessary congruence between thebeliefs ofpractioners and those oftheir patients. Second, alternative and orthodox medicine are seen as two ends of acontinuum rather than as two sharply divided systems. Legitimacy is acontinuous,3 not adiscrete, variable. The immense and always changing grey area (LaPatra, 1978) between alterna - tive and orthodox medicine can beacknowledged and dealt with aspart ofthe dynamics ofthe American medical system, rather than defined away orignored. Iwill accept K1einman's early (1973) definition ofmedicine itself asanorganized system ofideas and practices concerning sickness, asystem which is grounded inand derives its structure from agiven cultural context. Hefurther points out that medicine is asystem ofboth belief and action. Medicine has animportant symbolic component, which functions to make sense of,organize, and control illness. Despite itspopularity, alternative medicine in the United States has received 1ittle attention from social and behavioral scientists. Infact, most medical anthropologists, sociologists, and psycholo gists who have researched the American health care system donot give even token acknowledgement tothe existence ofalternative medicine, even inits most popular forms. This investigation focuses onthree issues inthe area ofpatient use ofalternative med icine touse alternative medicine, the effectiveness ofalternative medicine, andsatisfaction with alternative medicine. The analysis ofthese4 issues must beset inthe content of amore inclusive consideration ofthe dynamics ofalternative medicine, and will inturn many questions inthis 1arger framework. Isthere asharp line inmeeting human social and psychological needs between modern Western orthodox medicine and other medical a1terna tives inthe United States and other areas ofthe world, aromantic anthropological fantasy % How isthe present popularity ofalternative medicine related toother cultural changes inthe United States ? What isthe future of a1ternative medicine 7 Iwill beconcerned with these larger questions throughout this investigation, explicity relating them tothe three main foci ofthis research inthe conclusion. Medical pluralism as atheoretical orientation -- the view that the understanding ofheath care must rest on acomprehensive view of a11its forms --is a dynamic and problem-oriented perspective that I believe holds great promise both as aframework for thecross-cultural comparative study ofmedical sys tems and the in-depth analysis ofindividual medical systems. This approach, which a11ows for afull consideration ofthe complexity ofpluralistic system:5 even begin toencompass theentire range ofbeliefs andpractices dealing with illness and curing within ourculture. There are, for example, aside from qualified physicians atleast fifty different kinds of persons from whom one may seek medical advice ortreatment. Aperson aTurkish bath), may change his residence, may purchase and use anappliance (asun lamp, anelastic stocking, ahot-water bottle, anexercising machine), may relief indrugs (Hadacol, Lydia Pink ham's Vegetable Compound, Carter's Liver Pills), may change his diet (more orfewer vegetables, nuts, gravies, starches, fruits), may choose ahousehold remedy (bicarbonate ofsoda, salt, gar, oil ofcloves), may aproce dure (sun-bathing, cold baths, eye exercises,prayer), ormay turn work (a home medical book, anewspaper, acopy of Reader's Digest) for information and advice. ATT these andinnumerable other choices may fa11outside the field ofscientific medicine and can bemade without any contact with ali censed physician. (Saunders and Hewes, 1969; p.404) Great diversity inboth belief andpractice in medicine isthehistorical norm inthe United States ; this pluralism has been compounded byethnic and regional differences. Orthodox medicine's power to claim amonopoly onlegitimacy grew inthe twentieth century with itsability toeffectively diagnose treat avariety ofmaladies, with the establishment ofstrict standards inmedical education, and with the strengthening ofpublic faith and technology.6 Animportant istoday being questioned bythe laypublic, and the reasons for this questioning. Although Ihave distinguished orthodox andaltern ative medicine onthe basis oflegitimacy, itistrue that practitioners ofalternative medicine usually dohave divergent beliefs from orthodox practitioners concerning the nature ofhealth and disease. Inthe general antagonism between orthodox and marginal practitioners inthe United States, each denies the other legitimacy. \"Just asnew religious movements emerging in asociety dominated byasingle church tend totake asectarian character, hostile tothe church and itsofficials, and seeking toenvelope their own members in asafe, insulated community of believers, sonew medical movements may come topro vide not mere 1 ymedical care for their clients, but instead develop atotal world-view and culture which guides and also defends the following intheir con tacts with alien, dominant beliefs andinstitutions.\" (Wallis and Morely, 1976; p.16). Molgaard etal. (1979), Gebhard also emphasize thecultic orreligious character ofal ternative medicine, Animportant research question isthe extent towhich a religious character andpatients; Iwill beconsidering mainly thelatter However, Saward (1977) and Powles (1979) point out that Orthodox medicine, too, for all its emphasis onscience and empiricism, also rests atleast par tially onfaith. Despite overwhelming data that fac tors other than theavailability ofprofessional health care largely determine the 1evel ofhealth in a population, the subject ofpublic health always seems tocenter inpopular discussion onheath care delivery. \"(I) t\u00baisclear that weare dealing with anunshakeable belief system having its roots inshamanism, the Judeo-Christian ethic, and faith insalvation through science and technology. ...Instead ofdispelling unrealistic beliefs, the expansion ofeducation and access toinformation has tended toreinforce them. Procedures such asorgan transplants have little to dowith health, but the aura that surrounds their practitioners reinforces thebelief system.\" (Saward, 1977; p.194). This research investigates faith in orthodox as we11asalternative medicine, and 1ooks atthe relationship between the two.8 Thus, antagonism between alternative and orthodox medicine occurs both inthe realms ofbelief and of competition for resources --power, prestige, legitimacy, patients, money, facilities. Unschuld (1976b) points out that the outcome ofthis struggle isdynamic, always changing. Various alternatives in apluralistic medical system differ in1egitimacy, popularity, prestige, familiarity, cost, andavailability, among other dimensions; this configuration isconstantly shifting. Modes oftreatment appear, are modified, and disappear ormerge with another modality (Ward we11, 1972a). Relations between groups in apluralis - tic medical system range from sharply hierarchical toegalitarian and symmetrical. Press (1980) dis cusses the bases for dominance in such asystem as traditional prestige orusage, political imposition andlegalization, and prestige derived from usage by anelite population sector. Medical systems which derive dominance through local tradition are capable ofserving the widest variety ofmedical and psycho social needs; medical systems with more limited bases ofdominance, usually elite -derived and legally established, would tend toserve more limited ends. This suggests that orthodox medicine, which inmost groups inthe United States today derives leigitimacy9 from all three sources, serves wider functions than does alternative medicine, with its often more 1im- ited familiarity, legality, and usage. The above hypothesis iscontrary tothe theory connected with the widespread and\"illness.\" Disease isregarded asanabnormality inthe ofbody organs and systems, whereas illness isthe experience ofnegatively valued changes in states ofillness and social function, the human experience ofsickness. Kleinman (1978a), Kleinman etal. (1978), Kleinman and Sung (1979), and Field (1971, 1973) especially expound the view that modern orthodox medicine deals only with treating disease, ignoring illness and thus not meeting patients' 1ongings for care. Dissatisfied patients then turn toalternative medicine, which isadept attreating illness. Imention this here only because itisso widespread and apparently influential that itcannot beignored inananthropological investigation dealing with medical care utilization. Iwill examine the various facets ofthis issue in myanalysis; to anticipate, the data suggest thedisease/illness distinction has very little relevance toanunder standing ofpatient use of or satisfaction with a1 ternative medicine inthe United States. This may10 beless true for ethnic minority groups consulting afolk healer oftheir subculture, but this was not investigated. Theoretically Iwill take theposition that individual selection of amedical care alternative isgreatly influenced bythe social andcultural context within which this choice occurs. Therefore, itisnecessary toexamine the basis for the current popularity ofalternative medicine on acultural level before individual selection can befully under stood. The ideas below are derived from areview of theliterature, andestablish aframework forlater analysis ofthe data. The crucial assumption here isthat there is arelationship between attitudes toward and use oforthodox medicine and attitudes toward and use ofalternative medicine; that is, the various modalities form apluralistic medical system and not arandom assortment ofvarious medical alternatives. Inrecent years alternative modalities. The pressure forprofessionalization, reinforced by licensing requirements and increasing public andpri vate insurance coverage foralternative care, has11 raised the educational and ethical standards ofal ternative practitioners sotheir public image, eco nomic status, and social prestige vis-a-vis orthodox medicine have improved. The number andavailability ofalternative practitioners isincreasing. This is apositive ,increases supply, and suppy inturn engenders demand. Atthe same time, the authority andprestige of orthodox medicine have been onthe decline for a number ofreasons. This seems tobepart of agen eral cultural phenomenon involving crises ofpublic confidence inmany other areas ofprofessional author ity, inpart tothe increasing medical knowledge public (Haug, 1976; Coleman et.al., 1966); knowledge, tosome losing its role as apower base asitbecomes demon opolized. The growing public acceptance ofthelegit imacy ofalternative medicine described above cannot he1pbut toerode the power and authority ofprior established orthodox medicine. In a1973 survey of12 521 adults inRochester, New York, Stratmann et. al. (1975) found that people had more confidence in 1eaders ofmedicine than in1eaders ofother institu tions, professionals orclients should beincharge ofplanning and control ofhealth care, the largest number (48%) said both should have equal roles. In a1976 study of640 people inthe Midwest, Haug (1979) found that on acomposite measure of willingness tochallenge adoctor's authority, 59% scored atthe high end oftheattitudinal scale, while 48% reported atleast one prior episode of having engaged in achallenging behavior. This erosion oftheauthority oforthodox medi cine stemming from public ex pected medical \"miracles\"--such aspowerful antibio tics against infections and immunization against many feared diseases --tocontinue and multiply inthe Yet the very success oforthodox medicine in treating many acute, infectious, life-threatening diseases has led toanincrease inthe survival ofthe aged and infirm, and hence toanincrease inthe13 incidence ofchronic disease, which orthodox medicine often can dolittle toalleviate. Impossible demands ofphysicians complemented unrealistic expectations ofmedical science. Theideal physician isasuper being, faultless and overflowing with both humanity and vast technical wisdom and ski11, imbued with un 1imited energy and dedication (LaPatra, 1978; Bloom, 1963). Myerhoff and Larson (1965) discuss the doctor's symbolic role inAmerican culture as acharismatic hero who was being transmogrified into aculture hero. This isaprocess ofroutinization ofcharisma ; the g1ory ofthe doctor as A11 equally trained and skilled professionals areinter changeable, and charisma istransferred from the doctor toscience itself. :\"Indeed, asthe public bymeans ofmass media becomes in creasingly medically sophisticated and begins to penetrate themysteries surrounding treatment, the be1ief inthe charisma nad authority ofscience forfaith and hope whatsoever.\" (Myerhoff and Larson, 1965, p.191). This prediction, indeed insightful inthe days before the ecology movement reached itsheight, leads14 towhat Ibelieve tobethe most important reason the ques tioning oforthodox medicine. intheinfalibility and and technology tosolve all problems and provide America's salvation. Faith inscience and technology (Geiger, 1975) seemed toreach its peak in1969, with the awe-inspiring feat of1anding men onthe moon. However, this also helped inspire the ecology move - ment, which quickly began gaining power after the Apollo moon program. Itbecame popular toregard planet Earth as afragile spaceship. Science and technology could destroy as we11assave ;the ideas ofunlimited progress and growth were questioned. Size and technology bred impersonal and unpopular burea cracies inmany areas oflife, including medi cine. Iatrogenic illness related todrugs and surgery was increasingly recognized. Dissatisfaction was not confined tothe \"counterculture,\" but became widespread. Superior technology could not win inViet Nam, nor could itsolve most ofthe everyday problems ofhuman life. Technology also had great financial aswell ashuman costs, engen dering further itself as\"natural,\" isexpanding inpopularity (Cobb, 1977). Alternative medicine has come tohave great symbolic significance as asolution tothe problem ofour perceived loss of 1inked toorpart somuch cultural elaboration, but \"pure\" have great popular appeal, and are used tose11cosmetics, food, and other products aswell asalternative medicine. Yet although there may be adisillusionment with orthodox medicine, there isstill awidespread opti mism 1eft over from unlimited faith inscience and technology that one should turn tothe experts for help intimes ofsickness when one cannot cure one self, that there issome means ofimproving any human health problem. The prevalence ofactivisim over fatalism inAmerican values thus favors the inareas where orthodox medi cine haslittle tooffer. The American public still has high expectations ofmedicine (Callahan, 1977). Iforthodox medicine cannot offer aniatrogenesis - free furthering ofhealth, perhaps alternative medi cine can. Itisimportant toconsider, though, that only aportion ofthe American public has become disillusioned with orthodox medicine, and even among this segment many aresatisfied with medical care they personally have received. This will bedis cussed inmore detail insubsequent chapters. Afurther examination ofvalues surrounding and medicine inAmerican culture also helps illuminate theutilization ofalternative medicine. Itappears that Americans donot place \"medical on their list ofpriorities, but \"health\" per seis very strongly valued (Fleming and Andersen, 1976). Infact, our concern with problems ofhealth has increased greatly inthepresent century, leading tothe process ofthe (Kunstadter and 1975; 1970; Fox, 1977). There has tocrime This phenomenon can deal effectively with awide range17 ofhuman problems; 1977; Fox, 1977). Both medicalization and demedicalization have benefited alternative medicine. The former isrelated toincreased health consciousness and a11ocation of resources tothemedical system, while the 1atter has led to asearch for alternatives towhat came tobe regarded as atoo-powerful and ineffective orthodox medicine. Tosummarize thetheoretical background and focus ofthis analysis, Iwill beconcerned with main issues inthe area ofpatient use ofalternative medicine :the decision touse alternative medicine, the effectiveness ofalternative medicine, andsatis faction with alternative medicine. The concept of medical pluralism isthe key idea inthis approach, for Iview the American medical system as ahighly diverse and complex system composed of avery large number ofbeliefs andpractices which can beroughly isdynamic, and related toother areas of American society andculture. The symbolic dimension ofthis medical system isquite important toboth patients andpractitioners.18 Methodology This isaninterdisciplinary study integrating methods from anthropology, sociology, and psychology. Data were gathered from 45patients intwo age groups; a11patients were first-time users ofone of two alternative medical centers in aWest Coast metropolitan area. Iwill describe these settings in detail inthe following chapter. The age groups under study were midlife adults, ages 33to39, and those over 55. Ihad originally planned tointerview only those over age 60, but lowered thecriterion age about half way through the interviewing inorder tospeed the research. Ichose the older group because of myinterest ingerontology, and the younger age group for comparison, and fortheir theoretical interest aspossibly undergoing some kind ofmid 1ife crisis. Participant-observation was the major method used toestablish the ethnography oftheclinics. This fieldwork was carried out from February through June, 1979. During this time Iobserved all aspects of the workings oftheclinics, established relationships with the person who owned both clinics, employees, andpractitioners attheclinics, and informally interviewed ofthe acupuncturists with admin istering moxibustion and removing acupuncture needles from patients. Ialso performed small office chores when requested. This period established anindis - pensable background for the more formal, structured research which followed it. From October, 1979 through July, 1980 Igathered data from patients according tothe following design. From initial forms each newpatient filled out Iwas able toascertain the age, sex, and general area of residence of a11newpatients ateach ofthe two clinics. byletter, and then bytelephone shortly thereafter. All those who agreed topartici pate were interviewed assoon aspossible. The initial interview took between 45minutes and 2-1/2 hours toadminister, averaging about 1-1/4 hours. This interview covered awide range ofhealth-related attitudes 5and experiences. Ifpatients did not plan toreturn totheclinics, Ithen administered those portions ofthe second interview which were of general interest, not specific totheclinics. This usually took about 10minutes. Ifpatients were considering returning totheclinics, Igave them20 which Ire quested them tofill out, ifpossible, one after each treatment attheclinics. After they terminated treatment orhad received several months oftreatment, Ireinterviewed each ofthese repondents indetail about their experiences attheclinics, and also asked them the same other general questions thepatients who had not returned answered. Atthis point Icollected anypost-treatment questionnaires they had completed. Many compromises had tobemade inthe course of this research. Ideally, Iwould have liked tointer view each patient for thefirst time before they received any treatment attheclinics ;this was impossible for reasons that will become apparent inthe next chapter. The lack ofcooperation of some ofthestaff attheclinics was the biggest barrier tothe smooth execution ofthe above design. The fact that there was only one interviewer also hampered the research. Myinitial goal was 20respondents ineach age group. During the period that Iwas contacting potential sujbects for thefirst time (about 6months), there were 40potential midlife subjects and 49 potential elderly subjects inthecriterion age21 groups. Ofthemidlife patients, 11(28%) alanguage barrier. Twenty-two people (55%) were interviewed age group. older 17(35%) refused toparticipate, 4(9%) could not becontacted, and 5(11%) could not beinterviewed because of a language barrier. Twenty-three (47%) participated. Those who did notparticipate did not differ sub stantially from those who did with regard toage, sex, orresidence with one exception. The elderly who refused toparticipate tended tobethe very old; 36% ofthose who elderly particpants were age 75or Afurther description sample and their relationship toother newpatients who attended theclinics during the research period will begiven inthe next chapter. The refusal rate declined sharply over the course ofthe research as Idevised amendments oftheini tial letter contacting potential participants and grew more adept atinteresting people inthe research. Reasons given for notparticipating areenlightening. Ofthe older patients who refused, 24% were too sick toparticpate, whereas only 9%ofthe younger group22 gave this reason. Ofthe younger patients who refused, 64% said they would like toparticipate but were too busy; 18% ofthe elder 1ymentioned this. None ofthe younger patients who refused, but 42% ofthe older ones who did, were suspicious ofor simply did not understand the research, and noamount ofexplanation seemed sufficient tochange this. This, and the high rate ofrefusal because ofillness, make the lowparticipation ofthe very elderly under standable. Increased cooperation ofthepractitioners attheclinics may have raised the percentage of those who participated somewhat. The reasons for refusal could not beascertained in 28% ofthe younger patients and 18% ofthe older ones. Ibelieve that for a11purposes relevant tothe research questions examined here, the respondents aresufficiently representative of a11those intheir age groups who used theclinics for thefirst time during the period ofresearch toprovide astrong data base for avalid analysis. This is asmall scale, exploratory study aimed atexamining, in a preliminary way, the dynamics ofalternative medi cine. This study was not meant tobeinthe nature of asurvey. Idonot claim these respondents are representative ofanyone but those oftheir age groups23 atthese twoclinics, and this The relation ofusers ofthese clinics toother utilizers of alternative medicine inthe United States will be examined inthe next chapter, but cannot befirmly established. Despite these limitations, these data are quite interesting and important inand of themselves, suggesting anumber ofpatterns and hypotheses inanarea that has received very little research. The design ofthis project isfocused very much onthepatient, the individual undergoing treatment. Kleinman (1975) suggests that the tendency toexclude individual behavior, especially its biological substrates and subjective dimension, from studies in the culture and medicine field is amajor conceptual error inmedical anthropology. Focusing exclusively onthe sociocultural dimensions ofillness tends to distort and ofstudies inthe area ofculture andmedicine. \"Although notion be24 careful toavoid theopposite extreme ofstudying the individual divorced from his society and culture. Although Idonot always have sufficient data tobe able tothoroughly ofresearch. Ialso attempt very strongly totake the neutral position, rare instudies ofpluralistic medical systems, ofnot favoring anyparticular system of medicine over any other asbeing either more or 1ess physiologically effective ormore or1ess psy chologically andculturally meaningful. These questions for research, notinitial biases. Ialso endeavor not totake sides onthe issue ofpatient versus doctor. Complete objectivity isofcourse impossible, but not any ifthis type ofresearch istohave validity. Medicine itself is surrounded with anincredible amount ofemotion. Itis a11too often dis cussed byboth physicians for that matter bysocial sicentists in aspirit ofpositively mystical sentimentality. His spokesmen praise thephysician for his superhuman qualities; his detractors damn him because heisnot superhuman. The patient isdefended asone ofthe that are human beings, with nomore orless vice and virtue than the class implies. Iassume that both dothe best they can with theabilities they have and that, consonant with mydeliberately 1imited analytical viewpoint, both are no more orless admirable than the structure ofcircumstances surrounding them allows them tobe.(Freidson, 1961; p.20). The above and Setting ofthe Research Ethnography ofthe C1inics This research was conducted at two alternative medical clinics in ametropolitan area onthe West Coast ofthe United States. The following brief ethnography ofthese clinics has two purposes. First, itwill establish the necessary context for understanding the individual utlization data. Secondly, so few studies have been made ofalternative medicine inthe United States that such ethnographic material isinteresting and important inand ofitself in contributing toour knowledge ofthe dynamics of thepluralistic American medical system. A11 names used inthis dissertation are pseudonyms. The Mayfield Medical Center, where research was begun, was located in amiddle-class, residential, ethnically heterogeneous neighborhood about 30min utes bycar from the metropolitan area's downtown center. Its companion clinic, the Davis Medical Center, was in a1ower-class, \"tenderloin\" area very close todowntown. Both clinics were privately owned bythe same person. The former clinic had27 been inoperation for approximately seven years when Istarted fieldwork inFebruary, 1979; the latter clinic opened its doors for thefirst time about amonth and ahalf after Ihad begun myresearch. The Mayfield Medical Center was located on the second floor of abuilding at arather busy, noisy intersection. Public transportation tothe clinic was excellent, and parking was also fairly easy. Onthe front door were official-looking brass plaques with the names offive medical doctors, only one ofwhom actually worked attheclinic. Inside the walls were white and rather weathered looking. There was one steep flight ofstairs, which several elderly and handicapped patients had trouble with , uptothe waiting room and treatment room. The reception desk was atthe head ofthestairs, and there was seating for about 8people towait com fortably. There were twobulletin boards inthe waiting room with seldom-changed newspaper and magazine clippings onfood, smoking, and other aspects ofpreventive medicine. Very 1ittle ofthe available reading material, however, related to health; the major magazines inthe waiting room were Time and Newsweek. All ina11, theimpression was of aclinic rather sparse and worn, but not28 decaying ;the bare white walls provided anambience more business -1ike than home -like. There were eleven treatment rooms and three other rooms used for ad ministrative andclerical purposes. The clinic included amedical doctor and also offered avariety ofalternative medical techniques, depending onthe personnel employed atthe time. When Ibegan research these techniques available were homeopathy, massage, ultrasound, \"the zapper\" (adevice used biofeedback, hypnosis, relaxation, andnutritional counseling. There were also partially separate programs toaid clients with smoking cessation and weight reduction. Due tohigh employee turnover, which Iwill describe indetail, bythe time Ibegan interviewing patients the major treatment alternatives were reduced to chiropractic, acupressure, acupuncture, nutritional counseling, and the weight and smoking programs. Most patient visits were scheduled appointments, although unscheduled walk-in patients were always accommodated. Ontheir first visit, newpatients filled out detailed forms onthemselves and their medical history. The fee for thefirst visit was $40, and subsequent visits cost $20. Laboratory29 tests, vitamin purchases, and additional services were extra. Asign onthe reception desk requested payment atthe time oftreatment, but this policy was not at a11rigorously enforced. Since a11 work was supposedly supervised by amedical doctor, office visits were generally covered byprivate insurance and government welfare programs. However, the extent towhich the clinics were able toaccept government welfare medical programs and the amount ofmoney directly charged tosuch welfare patients varied widely due tochanges inthe owner's policy during the course ofthis research. The Davis Medical Center was anew office 1ocated onthestreet 1eve 1. Directly inside the front door was the reception desk and waiting area, which was abit smaller than atMayfied. The paint was fresher and the rug cleaner than atMayfield, but the bare white walls were still stark. Inthe back were seven treatment rooms and two rooms used for administrative andclerical purposes. Onthe doors ofseveral ofthese rooms were official -1ooking plaques with the names oftitled medical personnel, only two of whom worked attheclinic. Thus, the impression fostered atboth clinics was of amedical center staffed primarily by M.D.s.30 The treatment techniques available, theprac titioners employed, charges for treatment, and other policies were a11nearly identical between the two clinics, and for the remainder ofthis report I will usually not distinguish between the twoclinics and their patients inmyanalysis. For the most part, despite the widely disparate neighborhoods, thepatients atthe twoclinics were not very differ ent from each other inany obvious way. Davis attracted 1arge numbers ofpatients who worked occasion were types. Mayfied Medical Center, share oflower-class who arrived bypublic transporation orwho had cars andpreferred todrive (parking was very difficult around the Davis Medical Center). Overa 11, both clinics attracted quite avaried and diverse range ofpatients interms ofage, income ,occupation, andethnicity; ofthe major reasons Ichose these clinics asthe site for this research. The many and diverse practitioners and other per sonne 1,though, 1argely set the character ofthe clinics. Included inthis are about 30people,31 not a11of whom Ican describe indetail. These people fall into four categories: the owner, licensed medical practitioners (the M.D.,chiropractor, homeo - pathist, acupuncturists), unlicensed medical prac titioners (masseuses, smoking and weight counselors, andothers), and employees who performed mainly non medical functions (sales people, receptionists, book keepers). Iwill concentrate here onthose Ijudged tobemost important tothe workings oftheclinic, and whom Ihad the opportunity tointeract with ofindividuals will lead tothe disussion ofinterpersonal rela tionships and processes attheclinics. last two categories ofemployees --unlicensed medical practitioners and nonmedical personnel --had much incommon and overlapped. A11 were paid straight, hourly salaries fortheir work attheclinics. All the unlicensed practitioners worked atthe front desk atsome time, answering phones, making appointments, checking inpatients, collecting money from patients, filing charts, and performing other clerical tasks. Inturn, a11ofthe nonmedical personnel, with the exception ofthe two bookkeepers, attimes performed some medical functions around theclinic, such as drawing blood ordoing smoking aversion; some of32 these people had also been employed inthepast, either atthese clinics orelsewhere, performing medical services. Mygeneral impression was that, with very few exceptions, the individuals inthese two categories were not ata11 thoroughly oreven ade quately trained for the medical tasks they were called ontoperform. Despite this fact, most seemed uni formly enthusiastic about working inthe health field and believed inthe value ofwhat they were doing. They had agenuine interest both inalternative med icine and intheir patients. Every one ofthe employees inthese two categories was young --intheir twenties and thirties. Iwill describe three oftheunli censed practitioners --Ellen, Donald, and Gina --in some detail and then briefly consider some ofthe other employees inthese twocategories. E11en was one ofthe better trained ofthe un 1icensed medical personnel. She had been employed atMayfield for ayear and had many ofher own patients when Ifirst began doing fieldwork. Ellen received aB.A. insociology and English and began doing mental health work after college. She became frustrated with this and took ajob in ahealth food store, where she had the opportunity toread thestore's books and get intrigued with the idea that much mental33 disease was based onbiochemical factors that could belargely traced topoor nutrition. Atthe time she was employed atMayfield, E11en was second year of atwo-year program ative medical practitioners in awide range oftech niques. Although the school was not accredited, E11en was enthusiastic about getting hercertificate ofcompletion; she spent long hours inclasses and studying, and paid out several thousand dollars for tuition and other expenses. Eventually she wanted to get aPh.D. Intheclinics E11en worked primarily as aweight counselor and amasseuse. She also performed these services privately inher home, where, inaddition, she did general psychological counseling. She was conscientious and careful not to\"steal\" patients from theclinic toherprivate practice. Ellen saw herself asforced into this extra work bythe low wages paid toher intheclinic, about which she was extremely dissatisfied. She characterized her self asstruggling, starving, mistreated, and performing professional services atwages far below her worth. Her rancor against the owner oftheclinic was quite intense. Besides dissatisfaction about her salary, she saw him assexist and greedy, abusi34 nessman more interested inmoney than inalternative medicine orpatients' well-being. She was also bitter about some ofher fellow employees, whom she felt took advantage ofpatients and did not dotheir job adequately, making extra work for her. ToE11en, the essence ofholistic health was taking responsibility for one's own health ;the task ofthe healer was tofacilitate this. This was especially important for women, who have been cul turally conditioned tohate their bodies. Thus, for E11en, alternative medicine had asignificant political component; she was actively involved inseveral feminist issues. Despite her relatively extensive training, Ellen still performed medical services for which she was not adequately trained. This isespecially true of ultrasound, which sheoccasionally used inconjunction with massage. Ultrasound therapy utilizes amachine which emits concentrated high-frequency sound waves which penetrate fat and muscle and turn toheat when they hit abone. Reflecting off the bone, this heat warms aninjured muscle from the inside, pro moting healing from certain injuries. The technique isusually administered bytrained physical therapists, since itcarries the danger ofsevere 1)burning the35 the muscle from the inside before any pain iseven felt. When wediscussed the subject, E11en admitted she had been using ultrasound without understanding theprinciples behind itorrealizing ithad any dangers. She was also performing counseling with far less training and supervised experience than required by1aw of 1icensed counselors. After she received her degree, E11en left Mayfied towork at acenter for disturbed adolescents, again doing counseling. Donald had also beememployed atMayfield ayear when Ibegan myresearch. His duties there consisted mainly oftreating the smoking cessation patients, performing massage, and recruiting newclients for the smoking program. His main interest, however, was Chinese medicine. Donald did not appear tohave any consistent philosophy ofalternative state,\" garlic, and soon. He was the most ambitious ofthe young unlicensed prac titioners. Donald was working onboth his acupuncture license and opening his own acupuncture clinic with some other practitioners in anearby suburb. Claiming hehad amillionaire former patient backing him up, Donald had large expectations ofhis future inaltern36 ative medicine, and was forever coming upwith schemes tomake money. Although healso felt hewas under paid, hedid not seem very bitter about this. Instead, hemade the most ofthe1aissez-faire atmosphere of theclinic tospend his time doing what hewanted when hewanted, disregarding the owner's directives and completely neglecting his responsibility of recruiting newclients for the smoking program. Donald enjoyed reading books onvarious alterna tive medical techniques and took classes inChinese medicine at alocal university. Despite this, he, too, was inadequate lytrained for several ofthemedi cal services heperformed. Healso utilized ultra sound without any training inthis technique. Donald enjoyed the fact that his work was largely unsuper vised and hecould use any treatment example ofthepotential trained personne 1. Donald had taken acourse inbio feedback two years before, but had not practiced it since. One ofthe other practitioners had recommended apatient get biofeedback, and Donald was assigned to administer it. Theclinic's electromyogram machine was old and inoperative; Donald tinkered with ituntil37 the meter worked, but hecould not get the tone, which provided the feedback, towork. Ashort time before thepatient arrived, Donald decided topractice onme. Since Icould not get feedback from atone, Donald reported meter readings to meatirregular intervals while Iwas trying torelax. Donald did not appear tosee any problems with this totally inadequate and unsound procedure. Atother times, Donald wasdeter mined topractice his acupressure onpatients, even ifthey requested adifferent service. Despite these and many other problems, myim pression was that most ofDonald's patients liked him and thought hedid them some good. Heinspired con fidence inhis patients with his self-assured manner. Donald quit working attheclinics afew months after was toreplace Donald inthe Smoking cessation program. She was acollege graduate who had previously worked inreproductive and weight counseling and also as aresearch assistant inan assortment ofprojects. Her concern with money seemed limited togetting inasmany hours aspossible to get paid asmuch aspossible. her job38 seriously, and worked hard atbuilding uptheclinics' clientele. Before Donald left, hetrained her for about aweek and ahalf ondoing the smoking aversion. When she had tohandle herfirst patient alone she was, byher own admission, totally unprepared andun sure ofherself. Ellen and another unlicensed practitioner aided her informally for several weeks until she be- came more confident. While Donald had used acupres Sure with his smoking patients, Gina used various breathing exercises. After about eight months, Gina quite her job attheclinics tostudy nursing. Mary was abookkeeper who had worked atthe clinics for two years before Ibegan research. She quit about five months later totake ajob as a teacher. Tina washired toreplace her. Both book keepers worked part time and were also students. Alice, who replaced E11en, wanted toget her weight patients into \"organic foods,\" especially yeast. She had taken some counseling courses but had never worked as acounselor when she wasfirst given responsibility forpatients; her training inmassage consisted of aweekeend workship. Martin, asmoking cessation counselor, had aPh.D. inpsychology and clinical Social work (thus, hewas actually licensed, although performing ajob usually done byunlicensed39 practitioners); two other smoking counselors hadprior training and experience insmoking aversion before starting towork attheclinics. Another smoking coun selor had training only inChinese medicine. Vicky, areceptionist atDavis, had done some graduate work inpsychology and decided togoback toschool to become achiropractor inthe smoking program as atherapist and as aresearcher ontheeffective ness ofthe program. During the course of employed but came Although heaspired to get aprofessional, well-paying job, Dick worked at odd sales jobs orwas unemployed during the time I knew him. Thus, the unlicensed medical practitioners and nonmedical personnel were ahighly diverse group of people interms ofqualifications, training, and work experience. Iby no means have described all ofthem. These people did not somuch fill roles they were hired toperform ascreate aniche for performing their version ofalternative medicine, within broad limits. Their training attheclinics was informal, on-the-job, and unsystematic. Most40 quit after topursue other careers, often still inthe field ofalternative medicine or some other health-related occupation. Iknow ofno one who was fired. Often they were incharge ofhiring their own replacements. Ingeneral, those who were employed simultaneously got along we11with each other. Thelicensed medical practitioners, a11 older than the employees inthe previous twocategories, consisted ofan M.D., ahomeopathist, achiropractor, and about ten acupuncturists during the period of research. These people worked on apercentage basis; thus, their earnings depended onthe number ofpatients they were able toattract and keep. Dr. Williams, thephysician, Specialized inopthamology, but also practiced general medicine and performed acupuncture. Ideally, hewas supposed tosee allpatients first and refer them tothe other practitioners after examining them, but this ideal scheme was followed with only avery small percentage ofthepatients. Dr. Williams worked about two afternoons aweek ineach clinic, but was rather unreliable and often far behind inhis appointments. All the other acupuncturists were Oriental doctors who had practiced asphysicians in their native countries but could not qualify asmedi cal doctors inthe United States. A11 were we11-trained41 inacupuncture, and all but one woman had severe problems with the English language. There was a high turnover among the acunpuncturists. The owner fired some for\"stealing\" patients totheir private practices, and others quit for reasons Iusually could not ascertain. Steven, the homeopathist, proponent ofhomeopathy for almost any somatic or mental problem, and claimed avery high success rate with hispatients. Homeopathy, hebelieved, can even effect changes onthe genetic level sothat defects orproblems are nolonger handed down to 1ater generations. Steven was inthe midst of writing abook onchronic disease that contained his whole elaborate mode 1ofhealth, disease, and the role ofholistic medicine. Hewas especially concerned with therole ofthe local blockages ofthis system. Hedid with this himself, but sent hispatients toE11en forthis. Homeopathy, among its other merits, could also re store the lymphatic system. Steven also trained phy - sicians invarious alternative medical techniques.42 Steven lavished agreat and concern oneach ofhispatients; often hespent over anhour with each patient. This resulted inlong backlogs ofhis appointments, with many people waiting over two hours past their scheduled time tosee him. Steven was the major licensed practitioner atMayfield when Ifirst began fieldwork, but hesoon entered amajor personal crisis period involving adivorce from his wife and aserious illness ofhis father's. Steven became quite unreliable, often cance 1ing his appointments atthe last minute totake aweek or two off from work. There had always been friction between Steven and the owner ofthe clinics. Steven considered the owner a businessman who had nointerest inhealing, while the owner was unhappy that Steven could not make money spending somuch time with each patient, and kept the waiting room jammed with his late appointments. Steven worked atthe clinics 1ess and less until finally hesaw people only inhis own private practice. Dr. Blake, the chiropractor who began practicing attheclinics shortly after Ibegan doing fieldwork, took over all ofSteven's patients who did not leave theclinics tosee Steven inprivate practice. Dr. B1ake quickly andefficiently began building uphis43 own practice within theclinics. Heoften answered the telephone, scheduling newpatients tosee him self, and even offering free initial consultations. Hespent the allocated amount oftime (about fifteen minutes) with each patient, seldom falling more than fifteen minutes behind inhis appointments. Heuti lized, besides chiropractice manipulation, acupres sure, vitamins, counseling intreating hispatients. Dr. jargon ofaltern tobequite moody, unpredictable, and reluctant tospend extra time with patients. After working attheclinics about ayear and ahalf, Dr. Blake quit tobegin his ownclinic. This was mode 11ed very much onMayfield and Davis; it, too, offered chiropractic, acupuncture, and some other minor treatment modalities inanostensibly \"holistic\" framework. Two other chiropractors then replaced Dr. Blake atthese clinics. James, the owner oftheclinics, was amiddle aged businessman. Theclinics were only one ofhis heclaimed hehad been losing money steadily atMayfield since heopened it, except for managing tobreak even inthelast few months before Ibegan doing fieldwork. Heseemed toboth enjoy and hate his clincs; hewent through ofenthusiasm about and hehad anoffice for himself atMayfield, hewassel dom there. Hedid not take very much interest inwho worked for him orwhat they did. James felt acupunc ture and the smoking programs were worthwhile, but labeled other alternatives offered bytheclinics as\"quackery.\" Heopened Davis inthe hope ofmaking some money and establishing amore worthwhile medical establishment than hefelt that Mayfield had turned into. Heexpressed frustration atnot having more time tospend administering theclinics. James's employees felt underpaid; yet hecomplained they did not even earn what they got, but spent most oftheir time fooling around and not doing what they were supposed to. Hefrequently lost his temper with them. James admitted hehad a1arge investment inthe clinics, both psychological and financial. Although the practioners perceived him as abusinessman in terested only inmoney, Isaw James express satisfac tion and excitement several times when talking about patients who had been helped orwho might behelped. The two bookkeepers, who were not involved with treating patients and who had awell-defined job todo, both had aconsiderably higher opinion ofJames as and anemployer than did those oriented45 tomedical practice, whofelt James did not under stand orcare about alternative medicine and demanded too much work for toolittle pay. Perhaps the book keepers were in aposition toappreciate James's financial problems, orperhaps they simply had less toquarrel with him about and were not under pressure tobring innewpatients. Important inunderstanding the following chapters onpatient utilization isthereferral agency James set uptodraw newpatients. This referral service was advertised inthe telephone book as aneutral group advising people which practitioners inthe metropolis could best meet their alternative medical needs. Infact, this agency was simply another line onthe Mayfield telephone system, andcallers were always referred tothe Mayfield orDavis Medical Centers. The medical policy oftheclinics, explicit in their printed literature, advertisements, andstate ments tonew andpotential patients, was topayatten tion toand treat the whole person, not just asymp tom. The remedies offered were portrayed asin harmony with nature, \"drug less\" and \"knife less.\" Atthe same time, theclinics very much exploited the symbols oforthodox medicine to legitimize their46 own endeavor andattract patients. The staff em phasized topotential patients that there was amed ical doctor attheclinics, and James reinforced this bydisplaying prominently the names of M.D.S not currently working intheclinics. All thestaff, including the receptionists and James, usually wore white coats, and sometimes even such official marks ofoffice as astethoscope. There was asemi-deliber ate clouding ofthestatus ofthepractitioners so that their training, credentials, and even immediate role was often ambiguous, andpatients could read agreat deal into the white coats andofficial manner ofthose treating them. Some ofthis ambiguity existed for thestaff themselves, and was manifest in afluctuating policy regarding government welfare insurance coverage. When Ifirst began fieldwork, a11types ofwelfare coverage were accepted for a11services available atMayfield, although patients were often requested tosupplement these low payments from the government with cash. When Mayfield was audited byone govern ment agency, James decided that patients could use their welfare coverage atDavis, but not atMayfield, unless they were seeing Dr. Williams. After this, policy changed sofrequently and was soambiguous that itbecame impossible tokeep track that atleast partially, the cost ofvisits totheclinics isquite important inunderstanding the dynamics of patient utilization oftheclinics. The disorganization manifested intheclinics' policy regarding insurance coverage was but one aspect ofthe more general disorganization apparent in almost a11phases ofclinic activity. This confusion had several roots: high employee turnover, general apathy about the success oftheclinics, inadequately trained employees, aninefficient and seldom present central administrator, lack ofaneffective system for communicating changes inpolicy orother matters ofgeneral interest, and the determination ofeach practitioner todowhat heorshe wanted regardless ofits repercussions for the operation oftheclinics. This disorganization was visible in avariety of areas. Billing records, patient charts, appointment books, and supplies were continually being lost or misplaced. Practitioners kept changing their sched ules, often from week toweek, without making this clear toother people attheclinics; thus, patients were not infrequently scheduled tosee aparticular practitioner at atime when that practitioner would not beavailable. Patients who wanted toget apar48 ticular treatment modality were often misscheduled toreceive another. Those atthe reception desk often were not familiar with ordid not keep track of government welfare insurance policies, and theclinics recurrently performed procedures onpatients covered bythis insurance for which they could not bereim bursed, and had towrite off as aloss. Other patients were misinformed ofwhat charges would be,and were unhappy when they were billed at aprice higher than they had been told toanticipate. Another negative feature ofclinic operation was asto 1ack ofcooperation among thepractitioners, atleast among the licensed medical practitioners. Since these people were paid only on apercentage basis, each usually tried tokeep his ownpatients, regardless oftheir success intreating thepatient's problem orthepossible benefit thepatient might experience 1inthis else inthe c1inics oreven tosomeone outside the clinics. However, this was rare and lacked any systematic49 foundation. There was noregular system ofmutual consultation about patients, nor any single person in charge ofmonitoring patient improvement. Aninteresting feature ofthe high employee turnover rate atthis clinic is aprocess Iwill call \"splintering.\" Most people off\" their ownprac tices which were ,insome ways, similar tobut on a smaller scale than theclinics they were quitting. This isevidenct from the above discussion ofthe major practitioners attheclinics. This splintering process had its roots inboth financial andideologi caldissatisfaction. Most ofthepractitioners felt that, ontheir own, they could both earn more money andbetter treat patients without interference. The dissension and lack ofstandards inalternative medicine also fosters this process. The field is open, there are few textbooks, and each practitioner can pursue his own philosophy and perhaps even gain afollowing. The generality ofthis process ofmedical splintering inalternative medical systems cross-culturally) and itsrelationship topolitical and religious splinter ing are important research questions which remain to bestudied indetail. There were many problems involved indoing re search atthe Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers.50 Foremost ofthese was ofthe practitioners. The general atmosphere attheclinics ofdistrust andapathy discouraged both interest in the research and collaboration with the researcher. Iencountered from thestaff not somuch hostility assimply not wanting tobebothered. Staff generally wished only toseetheir patients and gohome. I was onfriendly terms with almost a11the employees, but the conditions under which they worked were so strained that this did not suffice toobtain active cooperation inmost instances. The disorganization and lack ofcommunication system attheclinics made itvery hard for metokeep track ofwhat other people were doing and for them toknow what Iwas doing despite mybest efforts. When potential respondents asked questions about myresearch, no one atthe clinics seemed able toanswer them correctly, despite the fact Igave everyone both written and oral information onthesubject. As a result, some patients misunderstood the research and complained. Other potential respondents Icould not contact for some weeks after their initial visit because their records had been misplaced. Idonot think these barriers adversely affected thequality ofthe data obtained from patients who did decide toparticipate inthe research. However, under more51 idea 1conditions, Ibelieve Icould have conducted the research more quickly and obtained abetter response rate than Idid, particularly among the elderly. The following data onthepatients attheclinics were collected atthe Mayfield Medical Center from October 1,1979 through March 12, 1980 (with the exception ofthe period from November 7through No vember 25, 1979, when Iwas not available to dothe research) and atthe Davis Medical Center from Janu ary 7,1980 through March 12, 1980. Ihad originally intended tointerview patients only atthe former clinic, but changed this policy inorder tospeed the research. During the time periods mentioned, a total of403 newpatients attended the 2clinics. Of these, age, sex, and residence could bedetermined for 388 (96%). Ofthese 388 for whom complete data were available, 225 (58%) were female and 163 (42%) were male. The agedistribution ofthepatients is shown inTable 1. Although 1970 census data are unfortunately not available for comparis ontothe overa 11agedistribution inthemetropolis, itis thepatients are not representative; those age 19and under are certainly underrepresented atthese clinics relative totheir use oforthodox medical facilities. To52 summarize, about 1%ofthe newpatients under newpatients relative tothe clinics isshown inTable 2. Human subjects clearance restrictions precluded gathering general background data on a11new patients regarding such interesting variables aseducation, occupation, and marita 1 status; however, such information was available for only asmaller number ofnewpatients inany case, since a11patients did not provide a11the information requested ontheinita 1forms they were given. Detailed demographic and socioeconomic data are available for the respondents whoparticipated inthis research ;adescription ofthe sample will provide more specific information onwho used the Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers. Differences between the two age groups for whom information is available shows that this isnosimple question. The twenty-two midlife respondents were a11 inthe age range of33to39, most inthe upper half ofthis Fourteen respondents (63.6%) were between 33and 35and eight (36.4%) between 36and 39. The older group spanned abroad age range from 55to85,53 Table 1.

Table 3shows this age distribution more closely. Ofthemidlife respondents, 14(63.6%) were female ;inthe older sample, 18 (78.3%) were female. Tables 4through 9describe the two samples oneducation, income ,occupational, marital, ethnic, tables are somewhat difficult tointerpret without recent census data for this metro polis. Itwould behelpful toknow how representative these individuals are oftheir age range inthis area, and how much ofthe differences between the two sample groups isdue toselection related to attitudinal orsubcultural differences between the groups and how much tosimple demographic andsocio economic differences between the groups. These are questions which Icannot settle atthis time ;the answers, inany a1arge-scale statistical survey toberepresentative ofsome general population. The midlife sample isofhigher socioeconomic status than the older sample on anumber ofdimensions. While over athird ofthe 1atter did not even finish high school, acorresponding percentage ofthe former received one ormore graduate degrees. Infact, this group may becharacterized asaneducational elite ; a11finished high school, and less than ten percent did not attend atleast some college. The midlife group also tended tohave higher incomes than did theelderly. Both groups tend tobelower-middle ormiddle class, though, rather than either thedesti tute oraffluent. The younger respondents, in59 general, were employed orhad been employed inhigher status jobs. More ofthem were Caucasian, although neither group contained more than afew minority respondents. Only about aquarter ofboth groups were currently married. The older respondents tended to 1ive much closer totheclinics they attended than did the younger. Thus, insum, both groups for the most part spanned the white middle class, although the younger group was more concentrated atthe upper end ofthis range and the older respondents atthe lower end. This isnot atotally surprising finding considering the general structure ofAmerican society asrelated toage. The fact that theelderly respondents, who ingeneral had less physical and financial access totransportation, were more likely tolive inthe immediate neighborhood oftheclinics than were the younger, isalso easy tounderstand. The most interesting finding inthis consideration ofdemo graphic variables is,in mymind, the extremely high educational level ofthemidlife group. Inthe next section ofthis chapter Iwill compare the users of other alternative modalities inthe few studies available with this sample.60 The Context ofthe C1inics Itisdifficult toplace the system. Ican thus offer only asketchy and suggestive discussion. This will furnish some background, however, for determining towhat extent the data obtained inthis research can begeneralized, and provide ameaningful frame for the data. A1ternative medicine inthe United States is extremely heterogeneous; noone study could encompass a11 its facets. Modalities oftreatment may be religious orsecular, imported ornative, old or new, confined largely toone active lyopposed tocooperate with it. Within each modality are frequently numerous variations. Such classification schemes as\"regional\" versus \"cos - standing this complexity. Iwill not offer any classification of my own here, but only observe that theclinics under study seem tobeanamalgam ofseveral previously the Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers aspire to incorporate not only different modalities ofaltern ative medicine, but the best oforthodox andaltern ative medicine as we11. This unusual combination makes these clinics unique vantage points for observing the dynamics ofthepluralistic American medical system. Chiropractic isthe most popular form ofal ternative medicine inthe United States. Chiro - practic originated in1895. By 1930 there were anestimate 16,000 chiropractors; by1965 the U.S. had over 23,000 chiropractors. An estimate 4,250,000 people sought the services of a chiropractor during the period between July, 1963 and June, 1964 (White and Skipper, 1971). AHEW estimate in1974 showed 3.6% ofAmericans consulted 1978). Anational survey of2839 adults in1969 (National Analysts, 1972) found that atotal of 21% of a11Americans had ever used achiropractor for any reason. In asurvey of104 people inElPaso, Texas, Roebuck and Hunter (1972) found that 32.6% ofthese orthe immediate families ofthese had had ever visited achiropractor. Chiropractors are licensed in a11fifty states and covered byvarious private and public insurance62 programs a1arge number number of chiropractors appears tobeincreasing (Skipper, Schmitt (1978) concludes that the information that isavailable onwhoused chiropractic isspotty, inconsistent, and unreliable. National Health Survey general population data show aninverse relationship between education and chiropractic utilization. These data suggest that income and education interact so that the amount and frequency ofutilization of chiropractic isconcentrated inthe lower-middle income -educational levels. The large national sur vey byNational Analysts found that chiropractic patients as agroup had more education and income than thetotal sample aged 50-64, which iswhere the median age ofthechiropractic patients fell. This survey also found that men were more likely toutilize chiropractors than were women; 25% of a11men and 18% a11women said they had ever been to achiropractor. ACalifornia survey of30,000 people dating back to1954-1955 (Stanford Research Institute, 1960) found that chiropractors attended about the same percentage ofmale and female patients asdidphysi cians. Chiropractors were more likely totreat those over age 60and less likely totreat those under age 19than were physicians; they were more likely to treat patients in 10wer education and occupational63 categories. Inanequally old study, Koos (1954) also found that chiropractic wasutilized mainly by those oflower socioeconomic status. In amore recent study, Kane et. al. (1974) found that those choosing achiropractor for treatment under Work men's Compensation were notsignificantly different interms ofage, sex, race, education, marital status, orincome from those choosing physicians. Asurvey of161arthritis sufferers (Elder and Acheson, 1970) reported that the middle class was more likely than the upper orlower classes tohave consulted achiropractor about their condition, but only those inthe lower classes consulted achiro - legal andpolitical status ofchiropractors, medical doctors have by no means accepted the legitimacy of chiropractic. Asubstantial proportion oftheinter change that does occur between physicians and chiro - practors ispolitically motivated (Nofz, 1978). The role ofthe chiropractors64 donot have astatus equal todoctors. There is connected with the role ofthechiro practor, and thepublic isoften confused about what chiropractors doand how effective they are .In their E1Paso survey, Roebuck and Hunter (1972) found ageneral lack ofknowledge about practitioners other than M.D.sand disagreements concerning their role. While all respondents felt qualified torate the general effectiveness ofphysicians, 32.6% were unable torate the effectiveness ofchiropractors. Moreover, chiropractors were much more likely to beregarded asineffective orharmful and much less likely toberegarded aseffective M.D.s. Data onthe utilization ofvarious other forms ofalternative medicine are even more spotty and inconclusive than for chiropractic. The few avail able studies were carried out atdifferent times indifferent areas ofthe country, with varying methodologies and research interests. The large National Analyst survey reported these results: 12% oftheir sample had used anosteopath, than 1% ahomeopathist, and 3%another person not anM.D. Men and women were about equally 1ikely tohave utilized these practitioners, and those under age 40were less likely tohave utilized65 them. Utilization ofthe osteopath was more common inthe upper income bracket; aside from this, employ - ment ofthese practitioners was not related to education orincome. Counte et al. (1978) found socioeconomic status had norelation tothe choice ofalternative medicine bymultiple schlerosis patients. Researchers in asmall Southern town (Roebuck and Quan, 1976) found that blacks were more 1ikely than whites toconsult some type ofalterna tive healer; whites, however, were more oriented tosecular alternative practitioners. Mark1e et a1.(1978) estimate that at1east 20,000 Americans regularly use Laetrile, adrug whose legitimacy isstrongly attacked byorthodox medicine. Leaders ofthe Laetrile movement tend to behealth food advocates, opponents oforthodox medicine, religious fundamentalists, andpolitical unlit raconservatives. Data from 252 followers ofthe Laetrile movement attending a1976 symposium in Michigan (Ibid.) show therespondents were 60% female, had amean age of 44years, were highly educated (6.1% had some college and 15% had done post-graduate work), of 1ower occupational prestige, and predomi nantly rural (although the Symposium was held inan urban area).66 Eleven participants of ahealing marathon, another alternative modality, were predominantly well-educated, ofmiddle orupper socioeconomic status, and female ;a11were divorced (Mattson, 1978). In astudy ofgrowth center users, Lieberman and Gardner (1976) found that 98% ofthose choosing this form ofalternative treatment were white; most were middle orupper-middle class (60% employed had acollege education, 51% ofthese also had graduate degrees). The mean age was the mid-30s, and 5.3% were female. Nineteen percent were divorced, 10% separated, 8%widowed, 28% single, and 40% married. Acomparison group which chose more orthodox psychiatric treatment tended tobeyounger and of lower socioeconomic status; agreater percentage were women and nonwhites. This group had the same percentage ofmarried respondents, and more single and fewer divorced respondents. Those seeking the services ofthe Wholistic Health Center, achurch based center with twoclinics inmiddle and upper income suburbs ofChicago, were 59% female, 79.5% adults from 25to64, and 34% from within two miles ofthe Center (Tube sing etal., 1977). Onthe 1evel ofsex, age, and geographical variables, this isthe67 group which most resembles the samplc under study in this research. Incomparison with the findings ofthe other studies onutilizers ofalternative medicine, the sample inthis research tends tobe ofthe same orhigher socioeconomic status, the same or ahigher percentage female, and the same general age bracket oryounger. Although itisdifficult todraw generalizations from the above studies, medicine population parts ofthe country indiverse ways. The result is acomplex pattern which requires far more research tobeunderstood. The question ofwho uses alterna tive medicine inthe United asthe uneducated lower c1asses Even when the problem isconfined toone modality such as chiropractic, its solution isnot simple andstraight forward. There isgreat need for both national and regional incidence surveys toanswer thequestion ofwho is using alternative medicine. This would provide a useful background for the type ofresearch conducted68 forthis dissertation. However, the problem ofwho isquite different from the problem ofwhy. The former can beanswered largely interms ofnumbers and demographic and socioeconomic variables. The 1atter requires more intensive study andqualitative data. The two questions related ;con trary decides togoornot gotothe doctor because they are in acertain age or sex oroccupational group, although these variables may berelated tothe actual bases for adecision. Ibelieve thefailure toconceptually separate the question of\"who\" from the question of\"why\" isa fundamental problem with agreat proportion ofmedical utilization studies, especially inSociology, but also inanthropology. Being able topredict medical utilization isnot the same thing asunderstanding the dynamics ofmedical utilization. The most in teresting theoretical problems are perhaps best approached byasking why aparticular person goes to69 aparticular practitioner at aparticular This isthe question Iwill begin tackling inthe following chapter.70 Chapter 3 The Decision toUse Alternative Medicine The General Question ofMedical Choice The question ofpatient choice among various medical alternatives iscentral tounderstanding the dynamics ofanypluralistic medical system. Even in asituation where there ison1yone medical treat ment option available, thepatient and/or his family must decide whether touse that option orleave the perceived illness untreated. When more than one form oftherapy isavailable, thedecisions that must be made are more complex. The options open tothepatient and his family then include: (a) notreatment, (b) use remedies orother lay therapy, sive use ofone possi invarious cultures follow very diverse paths. Inthis research Iaim to explore the whole sample. Iwill 10ok atthe people use alternative medicine --looking atpatterns ofbehavior--71 but why they make the medical decisions they do-- 1ooking atthesubjective motivational, emotional, and cognitive aspects ofthis decision. Since the general question ofmedical choice has been studied inmost detail incultures facing the dilemma ofreconciling more orless recently im ported Western scientific medicine with other, more traditional, forms oftreatment, Iwill begin approach - ing this question bybriefly considering some ofthe vast 1iterature onsuch pluralistic medical systems. These studies have uncovered multiple, interre 1ated factors which are related towhy patients and their families choose various treatment types. Five classes ofvariables which encompass the large majority of findings may bedistinguished :(1) the symbolic component ofmedicine, especially atitrelates to nationalism, tradition, and the desire tomodernize (2)perceive physiological aspects oftreatment; (3) type apsects ofmedical care) ; (5)material reasons, including cost, convenience, availability, and shortages ofvarious types of practitioners. Any orall ofthese factors may beinvolved in anyparticular medical decision, andtheir interplay72 governs the course ofaction apatient and his family take. This choice process isquite complex and indeterminate. AsKunstadter (1975a) concludes inhis study ofthemultiethnic medical system in northern Thailand, there are several alternate courses ofaction andinterpretation atmost points inthe process ofseeking medical care. \"Aflow chart of the situation suggests anincompletely- deterministic branching Markov-like process, with many possible loops, rather than aunilinear unidirectional deterministic flow.\" (Ibid.; p.368). Western medicine indeveloping countries may insome instances symbolize colonialism and foreign dominance, while traditional medicine may, incon trast, come tosymbolize nationalism and cultural integrity. Medical utilization isthus related to problems ofcultural and individual identity, to the need for symbolic self-definition. Nichter (1978) notes that insouth India, educated orurbanized individuals, particularly Brahmans, reaffirmed \"Politica isevident asymbol ofthese values,73 but arallying point around which those wishing counter the tide of'instant \"modernity may gather.\" (Ibid., p.30). Croizier (1968, 1975) examines thehistory ofChinese medicine since itsfirst major contact with Western influence and concludes that nationalistic issues are crucial tounderstanding the dynamics ofthe Chinese medical system. \"Modern nationalists have seen Chinese medicine asproof ofChina's creative ability inatleast this onescientific area. With science generally hailed asthe key tonational survival, and almost all that science offoreign origin, claims for thescientific validity ofthe native medical tradition have apowerful appeal to cultural nationalism.\" (Croizier, 1968; p.6). In opposition tothis, desire for rapid modernization inChina resulted inhostility toward any form of traditional medicine inother factions. Aspiration for modernity also promoted the rapid adoption of Western medicine inHong Kong (Lee, 1975). The use oftraditional medicine may also bemore related to thesocial need toshow respect for custom than to anypolitical beliefs (Wen-shing, 1975; Gallin, 1975). Ithas been repeatedly observed inmany areas of the world that people will seek medical treatment they74 believe tobephysiologically effective regardless ofwhether orhow itfits into their belief systems; sick people are pragmatists who want only toget better (Maclean 1966, 1969, 1979; Madan, 1969, 1980; atreatment is not asimple variable dependent onstraightforward observation, but isvery much bound upwith cultural belief systems. Kunstadter (1975a) points out that inthe absence ofstatistical tests, perceptions of effectiveness are 1ikely tobeanecdotal andunsci entific for many types ofillness. Moreover, regard treatment asworthless if acure isnot immediate 1)obtained, and thus overlook aslow- acting cure that does not meet their expectations. The large majority ofthepatients of apopular allopath in a south Indian village failed toreturn ifdramatic symptomatic relief was not realized in aweek (Nichter, 1978). Tocomplicate matters further, these patients commonly changed practitioners only, asopposed to switching toanother medical system. Unschuld (1976a) notes that Wester-trained doctors inTaiwan must also achieve such rapid results toretain their patients. Whether atreatment isperceived tobeeffective depends largely on definition conception isthat Western medicine acts75 quickly torelieve symptoms, but does not remove the underlying cause ofdisease, which isamenable to traditional treatment only. These conceptions have been noted inTaiwan (Martin, 1975; Gale, 1975), Hongkong (Lee, 1975), northern Thailand (Kunstadter, 1975a), India (Nichter, 1978), Zaire (Janzen, 1978), the Admiralty Islands (Schwartz, 1969), and Guatemala (Gonzalez, 1966). Inaddition, patients may perceive the Western medicine which alleviates their symptoms asharsh, with negative side-effects not present in traditional medicine. Apatient mayreinterpret or condition towhichever heprefers. (Lieban, 1976). Evaluations ofeffectivens's may be determined byfactors other than alleviation of Symptoms. Ten out oftwelve patients studied of a Taiwanese shaman evaluated their treatment aseffec tive ;ofthese, one reported nosymptom change, two experienced only minimal symptomatic improvement, and one experienced worsened symptoms (Kleinman and Sung, 1979). A11 were under social and religious pressure tobelieve they were cured. The use oftype ofdisease as abasis for choos ing among medical alternatives fications ofillness. Where such adivision of labor among various medical alternatives exists in theattitudes ofthe laypublic, diagnosis rather than treatment isthe crucial focus ofchoice. The sufferer and his family must decide what class of disease heisafflicted with ;after that, recourse totreatment isfairly standard. Iftreatment arediagnosis seeking ofanother medi cal alternative islikely. Two dimensions ofillness frequently associated with medical choice are those ofseverity andchronicity. Gould's (1960, 1965) study of anorth Indian village concluded that folk medical practices were employed whenever thepatient's complaint was achronic nonincapacitating dysfunc - tion, was sought forcriti cal, incapacitating dysfunctions. Bhardwaj (1975) also reports this same choice pattern inIndia. In Taiwan (Kleinman and Sung, 1979; Unschuld, 1976a) patients usually resort toWestern-style doctors for acute disorders and indigenous healers for chronic disorders. However, incontrast, inMalaysia (Colson, 1971) and the Admiralty Islands (Schwartz, 1969), patients seek Western medicine mainly for minor dis77 orders and indigenous medicine for grave, acute disorders. Often people will employ certain practitioners for diseases ofnatural origin and another class of healers for diseases suspected tohave supernatural etiology. This pattern has been noted inMalaysia (Colson, 1971), Taiwan (Ahern, 1975b), Burma (Spiro, 1975), Ecquador (Erasmus, 1969), and Zaire (Jansen, 1978). Another itisnot immedi ately clear why patients regard some diseases as better treated bysome practitioners than others. Mac 1ean (1969) found that inIbadan, Nigeria women prefered Western doctors for problems ofpregnancy buttraditional practitioners for problems ofin fertility. Yet care not tooverly concretize type ofdisease as avariable inmedical utilization studies. AsPress (1969) reports in Bogota, cause and symptoms ofillness readily shift tofit thehealer towhom they are brought. That cognitive andaffective cal care influence people's choice oftreatment a1- ternative implies four hypotheses. First, medica 1 care fills functions other than thetreatment ofthe biological ofillness. Second, theeffec tiveness ofmedical incertain situa tions some goals orvalues may bemore important than ishealth. Fourth, there issome relationship be tween beliefs and behavior. Often, itseems, dis satisfaction delimits who not toconsult, rather than satisfaction settling who to consult. Variables comprising this component ofmedical choice include the need for understanding illness and having one's questions answered, congruence inworldview between patient andhealer, social support, personal atten tion, orsocial forpartici pation inhis studies make the following \"common sense\" assumptions: (1) these qualities are highly desirable inmedical care and meet human needs and longings, and (2) these qualities are much more likely tobefound in traditional healing than inWestern medicine, which isfrequently alleged tobeimpersonal, mechanistic, and unresponsive topatient needs.79 The following are some representative studies. Woods (1977) reports that amajor reason for the persistence oftraditional medicine among the Indians ofhighland Guatemala isthe congruence between this type ofhealing and the worldview of these people. Prescribed treatment which ignores the humoral concepts held bythe Indian and than ifnative were into theprescribed therapeutic program (Logan, 1973). InTaiwan (Ahern, 1975b), doctors often disregard apatient's request for anexplanation; gods and their assistants are sought out specifically be- cause they are able tote11thepatient what is wrong, providing thesufferer and his family with a means ofunderstanding the illness and a11aying their fears. There isanaffinity between the medi cal notions used byChinese-style doctors and their patients (Ahern, 1975a). InHongkong many people complain Western doctors donot listen totheir ideas about their illness orte11them why they, in particular, got sick (Top 1ey, 1975). Western doc tors inIndia fail tomeet patients' expectations ofdealing with more than overtly expressed symptoms (Nichter, 1978). Traditional healers inNigeria function asadvisers on 1ife's problems (Maclean, 1979).80 Other research shows that the common assumptions discussed above are not always true. Fabrega and Zucker (1979) found in astudy inMexico that aseffective asphysicians indealing complaints ofLadinos, and physicians equal curanderos inthe way they benefit the emotional and behavioral symptoms ofIndians. Patients in Taiwan often donot understand the shaman's explana tion oftheir i11ness any more than they understand the explanations ofChinese -orWestern-style doctors (Kleinman and Sung, 1979). Popular curers inthe urban context ofBogota spend little time with their patients, donot require theactive participation of family orcommunity, and are impersonal intheir approach 1971). Infact, patients may like theunfamiliarity curer's techniques. relationship ofeven material factors ascost, availability, and convenience tomedical utilization isnot always straightforward andpredictable, but must beset in acultural matrix. Most studies have found that the relationship ofthese variables tothe question ofmedical choice isfairly simple. People prefer 1ow-cost, convenient treatment; depending onthe situation, this may favor either Western ortradi81 1976b). However, though many people may choose lower-cost treatment out ofnecessity, they may regard higher-priced treatment asmore prestigious and desirable, and when possible deliberately choose the more expensive alternative (Beals, 1976; Press, 1969). Shortages ofcertain types ofpractitio choice (Spiro, 1975; Keswani, 1969). Sofar Ihave discussed the five general factors influencing selection of amedical alternative in developing countries. Now Iwill consider two other important themes inthese studies. Aninteresting finding bearing onthe general question ofmedical choice which emerges the1iterature onpluralistic medical systems indeveloping countries isthediffi culty ofchanging medical beliefs and the frequent divorce ofattitudes and action. Western curing prac tices may beheartily accepted while their correspond ing conceptual bases areeither unknown, regarded with skepticism, integrated insome fashion with preexist orrejected (for isimportant inthe itsuggests the hypothesis that Americans mayenthusiastically utilize82 alternative medical techniques without understanding oreven caring about their underlying philosophy, and may seek orthodox medicine while still embracing \"folk\" theories ofhealth and disease. Onthe other hand, Western medicine may erode thetheoretical bases ofindigenous medical systems (Croizier, 1976), 1eaving thepatient nowell-integrated belief system for arriving atmedical decisions. Another important dimension ofthis 1iterature bears onthe feedback between patient choice among various medical alternatives and the structure ofthe medical system itself. Patients mayutilize different treatment modalities inways that reinforce either ofavailable treatment. Inturn, thestruc tural and dynamic relationships between different forms oftreatment (this may have alarge political or1egal component) will influence patient choice. Inmuch ofthe world Western medicine has not somuch replaced assupplemented traditional forms oftreat ment; many patients inacomplex way 1976; Amarasingham, 1980; Wolff, 1969; Press, 1969). Although thepractitioners themselves may not behappy with this arrangement, inorder tokeep clients they must offer their patients what they want (Bhatia etal., 1975; Neumann etal., 1971).83 New medical alternatives which combine perceived advantages ofone ormore treatment modalities may develop tomeet patient demand; the medical system thus evolves and changes. Medical Choice inthe United States That the same five factors which influence choice oftreatment modality inthe preceding discussion are operative among minority groups inthe United States and other industrialized countries isevident from research onminority ethnic groups. Although the num ber similarities inthe dynamics ofmedical choice across developing and industrialized nations. In a study ofillness vocabulary among Mexican-Americans inTucson, Kay (1979) concludes that the acknowledge ment of\"Mexican disease\" not recognized ortreated by orthodox medicine isrelated tothe process ofdefining aspecial cultural identity. Conversely, the denial of folk medicine may be ameans ofseeking integration into the majority culture. Stories ofsuccessful cures enhance the reputation foreffectivens ssofmany curanderos inWest Texas (Graham, 1976). Martinez and Martin (1966) studied 75Mexican-American house - wives in alarge Southwest city, and found many switched84 from medica1 doctors tofolk healers when the treat ment offered bythe former was judged asineffective ortoo slow. Puerto Rican spiritists inNew York announce publically that clients should goto adoctor first and then come tothem forproblems the doctor cannot cure (Garrison, 1977). The onecharacteristic distinguishing thespiritist population was the lack ofrelief obtained through orthodox medical treatment ofperceived health problems, many ofwhich the doctor was unable toeven recognize. Orthepattern may betosee the doctor for cure ofthe symptoms ofdisease and the healer for treatment ofthe basic cause for the sick ness; mediums treat thespiritual cause ofsickness sothat they physician's treatment can have its effect. Black Americans mayutilize physicians only when folk remedies have failed toameliorate symptoms (Snow, 1978). Native Americans mayutilize orthodox medicine totreat the symptoms ofdisease, and Indian medicine todeal with the cause (Fuchs and Bashshur, 1975). Minority groups inthe United States also select treatment alternatives onthe basis oftypes ofdis ease. Mexican Americans inWest Texas tend toemploy folk medical practices for maladies not recognized by orthodox medicine, and use physicians for more serious85 ailments (Graham, 1976; Martinex and Martin, 1966). InNew York, Puerto Ricans tend toutilize the physician forclearly organic complaints, orthodox medicine and thespiritist forpsychophysiological and psychosomatic conditions, mood and feeling states associated with disease, and avariety ofnonspecific orcommon complaints, and thespiritist forintra psychic and interpersonal problems, sexual dysfunc tions, and improved functioning (Garrison, 1977). InBlack American folk culture, individuals must seek religious means toalleviate problems which result from sinful behavior (Snow, 1978). Native Americans with serious health problems used Indian medical treatment more (Fuchs and Bashshur, 1975). The cognitive and affective dimensions ofmedical care are another 1arge factor inpatient choice. Garrison (1977) concludes that animportant reason Puerto Rican patients seek spiritists isthat their physicians fail togive them aclear explanation of the causes oftheir problems. Physicians may not a11ow black patients toadequately discuss their fears ofhexing, thus driving such individuals to seek other alternatives (Snow, 1978). Groups for whom material factors have been found toaffect medical choice include Mexican-Americans (Welch et86 a1. ,1973; Graham, 1976) and Native Americans (Fuchs and Bashshur, 1975). Asstudies indeveloping countries found, belief may not beclearly related tobehavior among minority groups inthe United States. Some individuals inthe New York Puerto Rican community \"believe\" inspiritism and some donot ;the majority are ambivalent. Many who usespiritists intimes oftrouble deny faith in them; for others, belief becomes more plausible when they are faced with aserious problem which noone else canalleviate (Garrison, 1977). Moreover, the most common utilization pattern --asinThird World countries --ismultiple usage ofavailable resources rather than exclusive choice between them (Scott, 1975; Garrison, 1977; Fuchs and trialized countries 7 Alarge proportion ofthe studies concerning medical choice inWestern, industrialized countries where modern scientific medicine isclearly dominant ignore thepluralistic nature ofthese med ical systems. Such research usually concentrates on the following questions: 1)which population groups are most like 1ytoseek the highest volume ofmedical care; 2)what factors are related towhether aperson87 will decide toseek orthodox medical care (assuming the only other option isnotreatment); 3)choice among various alternatives within orthodox medicine (private practice, group practice, clinics, prepaid programs, etc.). Thefirst group ofstudies isconcerned with the who ofmedical choice, not the why, and isofonly marginal interest here. Iwill briefly review some ofthe1iterature inthelatter two categories to provide amore thorough background for the data analysis tofollow. Where scientific medicine clearly dominates the medical system of asociety, the use of aphysician istaken for granted when such studies, which treatment choice isbetween orthodox medi cine and notreatment, dohave some validity. Even with this limited perspective, these studies again lead tothe conclusion the five main factors affect - ing medical choice --the symbolic component ofmedicine, perceived phsyiological aspects oftreatment, type of disease, affective andcognitive dimensions ofmedical care, and material factors --are the same five factors88 operative indeveloping countries and among \"Third World\" peoples inindustrialized countries. A11 the following research was conducted inthe United States unless otherwise noted. Although for most Americans orthodox medicine does not have much relevance toproblems ofcultural or individual identity, entering the sick role asvalidated by aphysician does have alarge symbolic dimension. Although the sick role does carry secondary gains, to beill inthe United States is aform ofalienation contrary toAmerican achievement values. Shanas and Maddox (1976) report that many American elderly shun medicine and the sick role inorder todeny any signs ofphysical weakness. Older people with arthritis associate use ofhealth care with decline, dependency, andinstitutionalization (Barney and Neukom, 1979). Inhis classic study ofRegionville, Koos (1954) found that inthe overwhelming majority ofcases, mo tivation for seeking medical treatment was related toperceived efficacy. Specific reasons for obtaining care mentioned frequently byrespondents included concern for the immediate welfare ofthepatient, present care prevented possible need for future care, the hope ofpreventing sequelae for thepatient, and the desire toprevent the spread ofdisease toothers inthe family. When polio vaccine was originally89 introduced, the most important motivating factor for mothers giving consent for their children toreceive the vaccine was that ofattempting tosecure protec tion for their children against polio. Conversely, those mothers who refused to a11ow their children to bevaccinated were afraid ofnegative side-effects of the vaccine (Deasy, 1960). Alarge survey inRaleigh, North Carolina found that ofthose who experienced symptoms in afour week period, 29% ofthose who felt adoctor could provide relief for their complaint saw adoctor, while only 5%ofthose who felt adoctor could not aid them sought the services of aphysician (Julka etal., 1972). Belief adoctor cannot help them is a major reason why older Americans suffering from avar iety ofsymptoms fail toutilize medical services (Shanas Mayer, 1976; Shanas, 1962). Astudy inLondon (Wadsworth etal., 1971) found that many respondents said they had not gone toaphysician because they believed nothing could bedone for their complaint. Several dimensions within the category of\"type ofdisease\" influence patient choice. The most salient variable here tobethe seriousness ofthe disease. Hulka etal. serious complaints and 10% oftheleast serious received90 medical attention. Many respondents inRegionville failed tosee aphysician because they believed their condition was not important enough for adoctor's care (Koos, 1954). Suchman (1972b) found in aNew York City survey that symptom severity was crucial in initiating medical action. Others who have noted a relationship between serious ofthe disease and the decision toseek orthodox medical care include Shanas and Maddox (1976), Shanas (1962), Freidson (1961), and Wadsworth etal. (1971). Duration ofillness is important; sufferers tend not toseek functioning also influences anindividual's decision toobtain medica 1care ;i.11nesses which create problems ineveryday likely tobe treated by adoctor (Apple, 1960; Zola, 1963, 1973). Many andaffective care medical decision-making. Astudy ofelderly people help. Asurvey ofolder persons inNew York City (Cantor and Mayer, 1976)91 asked respondents their reasons for not going to a doctor when something was wrong with them; 16% men 9. tioned the confusing atmosphere ofclinics, 17% mentioned the insensitivity ofdoctors and nurses to older people, and 14% mentioned never seeing the same doctor twice. Differences intime orientation and other aspects ofworldview between physician and patient may discourage individuals from obtaining treatment (Wilson and Bloom, 1972). People may seek medical care intimes ofstress andcrisis when they are faced with heightened social and psychological needs and problems (Tessler etal., 1976; Mechanic and Volkart, 1961; Zola, 1973). Andersen (1968) found that higher levels ofknowledge about illness are associated with higher levels ofmedical utilization. Various studies conflict onthe relative influ ence cost, convenience, availability, and other material aspects ofmedical care play inthe decision toobtain orforgo treatment. Research indicating that these factors are animportant component ofthis decision includes studied byCantor and Mayer (1976), Berkanovic et a1.(1974), Andersen (1968) and Ludwig and Gibson (1969). Onthe other hand, studies finding that cost and other material considerations are oflittle impor inone manner ofrecon ciling these disparate results, that material factors are important inthe decision toseek medical care when illness isminor and common, but not when symp toms are considered painful and serious. This isone example ofhow the five main categories ofvariables (inthis ofdisease andmaterial factors) interact decision-making. Other research concentrates onthepatient's need tochoose among various alternatives within or thodox medicine. The most detailed andinsightful study inthis small body of 1iterature isFreidson's (1961) research focusing onpatients ofthe Montfiore Medical Group, aprepaid health care system inNew York. The five factors discussed above asbearing on the general question ofmedical choice can again be seen tobeoperative inthis area. Inthe category ofthe symbolic and identity -defining ofmedical care, the above-mentioned study byFreidson were willing toconsult asocial worker, amember ofthe medical team, even when they were referred byother practitioners. Amajor reasons for this was that consultation with the social worker, who was regarded as aspecial person, implied that the patient orhis family had passed the bounds ofnormality.03 Freidson also found that perceived quality of care was animportant factor motivating patients enrolled inthe prepaid medical plan touse outside services. Suchman's (1972b) New York study discovered that the major reasons respondents gave for changing physicians was that theindividual felt his condition was not improving. Lack ofconfidence inanddis satisfaction with the performance of aspecific doctor were significant factors indoctor-shopping found by aSalt Lake City survey (Kasterler etal., 1976). Stratman (1975) reports that perceived quality ofcare was the single most important factor influencing the decision tochoose among five kinds oforthodox medical facilities among asample inRochester, New York. However, alarge survey inEngland and Wales found that few people chose aspecific doctor onthe basis ofperceived quality oreffectiveness ofcare-- most respondents felt they could not assess aphysi cian's professional competence (Cartwright, 1967). Freidson (1961) concludes that type ofdisease interacts significantly with the three categories of perceived quality, emotional and cognitive dimensions ofcare, and material factors inthe decision among medical alternatives. Inroutine orcommonplace i11ness thepatient would use the most convenient service without paying too much attention toother9.4 factors. Inserious illness or acrisis, cost and convenience hadlittle bearing ontreatment choice: patients sought apractitioner who was perceived tobeextraordinarily competent and who was willing togoalong with thepatient's opinion about treatment. Patients chose among available types ofpractitioners toconsult onthe basis ofclassification oftheir problem-- the social worker was never consulted for clearly physical problems, although she might be considered for social and psychological problems. People may consult pharmacists rather than physicians for symptoms that are not considered serious (Koos, 1954; Muller, 1972). Patients more often used practitioners outside ofthe prepaid group inwhich they were enrolled for cognitive reasons --toobtain apractitioner who would agree with their conceptions ofillness andtreat ment --than for any Also, Kaster1er etal. (1976) found inSalt Lake City that patients who were not favorably impressed with their physician's personal qualities orwhofelt some hos tility toward him were more likley toseek another physician than were patients who liked their doctors aspersons. Both Stratmann (1975) and Suchman (1972b)95 report that affective aspects ofthedoctor-patient relationship account for alittle under onefifth of all decisions toseek treatment from another physician orfacility. Among material variables, itappears that aspects ofconvenience, such asdistance and waiting time, may begenerally more important than cost ininfluencing patient choice among various alternatives within orthodox medicine (Stratmann, 1975; Kasteler et a1.,1976). Medical Choice and the Tosummarize theliterature bearing onthe general question ofmedical choice inpluralistic systems, the interaction offive main classes of variables accounts forpatient selection among various medical alternatives. These five factors are 1)the symbolic component ofmedicine, especially asit affects self-concept and identity insuch areas as traditional vs. modern ornormal vs. abnormal, 2)per ceived physiological aspects ofmedical effectiveness oftreatment, ideas ofcomplete cure, prevention and negative effects or dangers oftreatment, 3)type ofdisease tobetreated, especially the nature ofthe problem, duration severity ofthe problem, and perceived etiology ofthe symptoms, 4)affective and cognitive dimensions of96 medical care, including the doctor-patient relation ship, social support, and the need tounderstand one's problems, and 5)material reasons, including cost, convenience, availability, and shortages ofvarious types ofpractitioners. However, the various medical systems inwhich these factors have been found to operate are quite disparate and notdirectly comparable. Animportant question toconsider before applying theresults ofthese past studies tothe data from this research isthe integration ofthe medical system with other cultural systems inany given instance. Amedical alternative exists and changes in aspecific social and cultural context. Western scientific medicine may prescribe insulin for diabetes inboth the United States and China, but howscientific medicine articulates with other aspects ofculture is not therefore the same between the two countries. Similarly, acupuncture as asystem must undergo some fundamental changes when transplanted from China to the United States, even ifthe points utilized for treating aspecific disease are the same inboth countries. Insmall-scale, relatively simple and techno 1ogically undeveloped cultures, traditional medicine tends tobemore closely integrated with other aspects oftheculture, such asreligion andpolitics, and97 toserve important social and psychological functions. Asthese traditional cultures change, and insome instances disintegrate, under the impact ofcontact with technologically developed countries, old medical forms maypersist. However, these traditional medical beliefs andrituals may nolonger beasintegrated in ameaningful fashion with other sociocultural struc tures, nor may they serve group and individual needs aswell. The important point here isthat new medical alternatives which combine the perceived advantages ofone ormore treatment modalities may emerge in response toboth medical and other sociocultural needs. Between recently introduced medical alterna tives and disintegrating traditional alternatives there may be avoid that new medical forms develop tofill. These emerging alternatives in apluralistic medical system may bemore meaningful incultural terms than any oftheir competitors, filling some impor tant gap. These forms may represent something to- tally new, arefashioning of apreviously widespread modality which has eclipsed (e.g. Chinese medicine inmodern Japan orhomeopathy intheU.S.), orelements borrowed for the first time from other cultures orsubcultures. For example, Asuni (1979)98 points out that theproliferation ofhealing syncretic religious organizations inAfrica both results from the dilemma ofthe need tochoose among various medical alternatives adds medicine inthe United States is insome ways like Western scientific medicine inde- veloping countries; both are inmany respects foreign toand asyet with their larger socio cultural context. Further analysis ofthe data will demonstrate that alternative medicine inthe U.S. is analogous totraditional medicine indeveloping coun tries similar syncretic cults in developing countries inthat types emerging from apopular base inresponse tothe problems ofchoice and medical and sociocultural needs. However, inits great variety and complexity, alternative medicine inthe United States isunique. Conclusions drawn from the study ofone type ofmedical system may not bedirectly applied toanother type of medical system because ofdifferences inhow these systems articulate with the wider culture and society inwhich they are found. Studies of asingle medical system may, however, provide insight into the dynamics99 ofmedical choice and important hypotheses for future research. Also, when any general theory (such asthe importance ofthedisease/illness distinction) can bedemonstrated not atheory to determine under which circumstances itisvalid and useful; such anenterprise will add greatly tothe theoretical framework ofthe medical social sciences. The Decision toSeek A1ternative Medical Treatment That the same five categories ofvariables influencing patient choice among medical alternatives emerge from such diverse bodies ofliterature as those reviewed inthe previous sections ofthis chapter isindeed interesting. However, theuseful ness ofthis finding fact that thespecific dynamics and content ofthe interplay of these five factors vary not only among different cul tural groups --asdiscussed inthe preceding section-- but among different individuals within any given cul ture. Inthe rest ofthis chapter bythe asthey ornot touse alternative medicine. Iwill100 divide this decis on-making process seek Centers, 2)the treatment. Iwill discuss thefirst process inthis section and the second process inthe next part ofthe chapter. Itwill behelpful toresummarize the outstanding characteristics ofthe sample here. Most members of both the midlife and older age groups were members ofthe middle class. The midlife respondents tended tobeofsomewhat higher socioeconomic status than the older participants, especially inhaving impressive educational attainments. Both groups were predominantly female and Caucasian incomposition. The composition ofthis sample must always bekept inmind ininter preting the conclusions drawn from these data. A study of asource ofalternative medicine other than these twoclinics or of apatient population that in cluded more ethnic minorities, people intheir twenties, individuals with low education, orothers that differed significantly from those inthis sample, might yield results atvariance with those obtained here. However, on ahigher level ofanalysis, reconciling these dis parate findings would yield clearer picture oftheoverall dynamics alternative care atthese specific clinics instead ofthe many other available alternative treatment facilities. For some people, another component ofthis decision isthe need tochoose among various alternative modalities. Using the five general categories ofvariables dis tinguised above as aframework, Iwill analyze the specific reasons respondents gave for seeking the services ofthese two medical clinics. Mydata limit me to aconsideration ofthe direct and indirect con scious components ofchoice. Such unconscious processes asthe seeking of aparental figure in apractitioner orthe psychic significance ofhealing which also under 1ine the decision toseek alternative medicine are undoubtedly significant, but wihout in-depth clinical material the discussion ofsuch factors would bepure conjecture. 1) Symbolic aspects ofmedical care Symbolic and identity-defining variables are less important for these respondents' decision toseek alternative medical care than such factors are inthe general question ofmedical choice inmany developing countries. Few ofthe respondents inthis research reported that alternative medicine was ameans of102 establishing asubcultural identity orrelating to nature (these processes may have been occurring unconsciously, but Iwill not speculate onthis). However, some ofthe respondents' comments are best classified under this set ofvariables. One midlife and one older respondent related that anegative turn intheir attitude toorthodox medicine was integrally bound upwith their involvement in social movements ofthe 60s; orthodox medicine was symbolically identified with other aspects ofthe \"Establishment\" under attack. Atthe same time Igot cynical about every thing else, which was roughly inthe late 60s, Igot cynical about medicine, too; and that was afairly major change. (Patty McNeil, age 33). Another, larger class ofrespondents identified alterna tive medicine with some kind ofmovement back to nature without anypolitical component; this group was comprised oftwo older and three midlife indi viduals. Weneed toteach the kids about respectingwildlife and their own bodies atthe same time --they'd come out alothealthier.(Stella Tyre 11, age 33). Iwant totry totheholistic doctor for a natural cure. (Eva Klonoff, age 80). One midlife and one older respondent identified alternative medicine aspart ofour times or a current fad. One midlife male discussed holistic103 medicine as afamily tradition which hewas merely continuing. Two midlife and one older respondent were attracted toalternative medicine bywhat might be described as akind of\"nationalism-in-reverse\" --the need ordesire oneself with aculture felt tobesuperior America. 2) Perceived physiological aspects ofmedical care Incontrast totherelatively minor importance ofsymbolic variables among both age groups, the set offactors subsumed under perceived biological aspects oftreatment was crucial inthe decis ontoseek a1 ternative medical care for every single participant inthis research. The specific content ofthis class ofvariables reflects central health-related concerns ofthis treatment ofmedical problems; fear ofthe negative effects oforthodox medicine, especially from drugs and incompetent doctors; the importance ofpreventive medicine; thedistinction between relief ofsymptoms ispeople's conception ofdisease causation and the nature ofhealth. Inboth age groups, approximately three quarters ofthe respondents had received prior medical treat ment ofsome type for the problems they brought to104 Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers. In a11these cases, theinability oforthodox medicine toprovide effective relief was amajor factor motivating people toseek alternative medical care. Indeed, the desire for atreatment that would achieve markedly positive physiological results was overwhelmingly the most important and consistent reason given bythis group ofsubjects forinitially deciding togotothe Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers. Iwill discuss, andillustrate with quotations, the major themes which emerged from the interviews. Aleading issue forthemajority ofrespondents inboth age groups was orthodox medicine's inability tosatisfactorily treat their illnesses. Usually this concern stemmed from prior experience inseeking relief from aphysician; inother cases the respondents weight. Iwas gaining on arigid, low-calories diet, Iwas tired andirritable. Iwas doing was stupid --Ineeded amore intelligent way tohandle what was happening. (Roberta Coventry, age 34). [speaking ofknee pain] The doctors were a11 unhelpful; that cost $35 andithasn't helped --they don't 71). [speaking ofback pain] Itook therapy-heat Igot through. Istopped the treatments after 5or 6because Ididn't feel good. (Ruth Stevens, age 74). When mylegstarted bothering methey hadit X-rayed and the doctor said itwasarthritis ofthe hip and nothing more was said about it. That's when Idecided togototheholisticdoctors --I'd known about them for some time -- and see what they could dofor me.(Eleanor Parker, age 67). Other respondents reacted negatively toorthodox medicine's inability orunwillingness todiagnose or even recognize their problems. AsBalint (1964) points out, when apatient isto1dthat nothing is wrong with him when hefeels there is aproblem, he will asoften respond with disappointment andirri tation aswith relief. [speaking ofdepression and other mental problems |Most doctors, when Igowiththis particular thing I'm trying todeal with, are very patronizing. They saythere's nothing wrong with me. . ..I've been toneurologists, doctors, spent alot ofmoney forpsychiatric care noone's come toany conclusions He[the the problem. there. (Joyce Winters, age 35).106 [speaking offatigue and a\"general lack of top health\"] Idon't feel that clinics as such are right when they say Ihave no problems, that I'm okay. The only way to behealthy istobeashealthy as Ican be. Idon't want anything less -that's why I'm going toholistic. (Laura Reeves, age 34). Afew respondents inboth age groups issued a blanket condemnation ofthe competence of a11doctors and the effectiveness oforthodox medicine todeal with any problem. Much more frequent was amarked ambivalence tothe competence ofdoctors and the efficacy and quality oforthodox medicine. Acommon manifestation ofthis ambivalence was toclassify doctors into two groups --the good and the bad-- on the basis oftheir supposed curing ability. The problem then became one ofselecting doctor out ofthe myriads ofdangerously \"bad\" ones. good health )It turns out the way todoitistopick your doctor very carefully. (Ste 11a Tyre 11, age 33). It's really hard tofind agood doctor. . Idohave faith there are some good ones, but you just don't find them inthe yellow pages. (Arlene Berman, age 37). Thus, when questioned about specific medical experiences, respondents would distinguish various doctors they had contact with onthe basis oftheir competence, often highlighting aparticular doctor whose perceived healing abilities were felt tobe particularly poor ornotably superior. Less often, the same doctor would beregarded ambivalently: able107 tohelp the respondent with one problem but not with another. Respondents judged physician competence not byparticular techniques orprocedures carried out, but byresults achieved and bythe perceived suitability ofthe proposed treatment for the individual respondent. A11 respondents were asked iftheir feelings about doctors ormedicine ever underwent any major changes. The majority ofthemidlife group answered positively; 72.8% indicated their attitude toward orthodox medicine had changed. Only 30.5% oftheolder respondents had experienced such anattitude shift. The older respon dents were more heterogeneous intheir comments in response tothis question--some felt more positively toward doctors after anattitude change and some more negatively, but none reported any major, general disi 11usionment with Orthodox medicine. Those inthe midlife group, however, commonly described asudden orgradual realization that their expectations of orthodox medicine had been unrealistically high, and asubsequent loss offaith in a11-too-human doctors. Iused toreally idealize doctors. When Istarted were father figures tome; Ithoughtitonly amatter oftime until they helped meout. (Mark Conrad, age 33). The only change isI've grown up alittlebit. When Iwas alittle kid Iconsidered108 them [doctors )all-powerful and Now Irealize they are just human andfallible. Itwas agradual realization. (Ray Engel, age 33). Until the time Iworked in ahospital theattitude Ihad was that doctors healed are sick you goto adoctor and hehas a11 the answers. The awakening came --Ifound out they're very human, they make alot of mistakes, they do alot ofexperimenting. Ifeel it's more experimenting than knowledge. (Linda Yardley, age 38). This finding closely relates tothe previous discussion oftheshattering ofoverly high expectations of orthodox medicine and itsrelation tothe more general cultural phenomenon ofloss offaith inscience and technology. Itappears that this shift isespecially acute, painful, and even embittering for individuals inthis midlife age group, who were raised inanera ofrapid technological expansion and high expectations ofscience and technology. This disillusionment among these respondents was in a11cases spurred by concrete experience with orthodox medicine 'sinability tocure their own orsomeone else's problems. Responses tothe question people are getting healthier a11the time as aresult ofmedical research support the above interpretation. The older group ingeneral felt more positively toward this aspect oforthodox medicine; 56.6% said people were getting healthier, 39.2% said they were not, and 4.4% were not sure. Incontrast, only 36.4% ofthe younger yes, 40.9% said no,and 22.8% were ambivalent.109 Inboth age groups, those who answered noorwho were undecided usually commented along the lines that people might beliving longer orwere less likely to beafflicted with certain diseases, but were not therefore healthier. Only one person stated that not enough money was being spent onmedical research. Again, the younger age group was more 1ikely than the older tofeel disillusioned with thepotential of orthodox medicine todeal effectively with disease. However, itis aremarkable testimony togeneral lack offaith inscience and technology inthis sample that even inthe older age group people were evenly divided onthebenefits ofmedical research, towhich this country has devoted somuch effort and resources. Complementary tothe expectation that orthodox medicine will not beeffective istheanticipation that alternative medicine might beeffective. These twin be1iefs were basic tothe decision toseek alternative medical care. Infact, when respondents were asked \"What doyou think isthe most important thing about alternative medical techniques 2\", alarge majority ofboth age groups mentioned some aspect oftheeffi cacy ofthese techniques. The elderly respondents were particularly concerned with simply whether altern ative methods would help solve their problems, while the midlife respondents more often described some rationale110 forbelieving that alternative medicine would have physiological advantages. The following arerepre sentative anwers tothis question bythe older group. People gotodoctor after doctor who don't help them, and then a11the sudden goto one doctor who finds what's wrong simple asthat. (Mary Sne 11ing, age 85). Idon't know. I'mjust Schaeffer, age 81). Idon't know. Ifone thing doesn't work you can always try another, Isuppose. (B1anche Adams, age 71). They might help you. (Marlene Kelly, age 74). Ithink it's good. Ithink some things work with some people and some don't. Ithinkit's good totrydifferent things. (Ruth Stevens, age 74). The ones I've tried have worked. (Harold Taylor, age 73). Inboth groups, this expectation that alternative medicine could ormight beeffective was sometimes coupled with adesperation tofind relief or astate ment ofthe need tobelieve that something would help. Theanticiaption that alternative medicine might help was often based ontheindividual's prior experience orontestimony that these techniques had helped other people. Two common themes were \"if ithelped before, itcan help again\" and\"if help me.\" Another group ofresponses can beclassified under the story line \"itdidn't really help before, but there was some reason forit;111 maybe itwill help this time.\" While observations ofalternative medicine's efficacy were empirical, they were hardly scientific ;for a11respondents, the fact that one person had been helped was enough to establish avalid basis for trying atechnique. A11 evidence cited for the usefulness ofalternative methods was anecdoctal. Itappears that these middle-class afriend ofmine lost atremendous amount ofweight through acupuncture. Just seeing the technique worked for one person changed my mind. (E11en Hart, age 36). Iread abook about aveterinarian dealing withexotic animals who went 1earned acupuncture and cured agiraffe. Inthe demonstration inChina they did amajor operation on ahorse just using acupuncture and rightafter thehorse got upand walked around andstarted toeat. The so Idecided to tryit. (Pauline Allcott, age 63). Although some respondents stated they expected acomplete cure in adelimited period oftime, the majority ofthese patients were unsure ofhow much alternative medicine could help them orhow long it would take to a11eviate their problems. The older group was more likely tohave aspecific method they112 thought would behelpful inmind when initial appointment atMayfield orDavis Medical Centers; 60.9% ofthe older respondents and 45.5% of the midlife respondents had aspecific treatment method inmind when they first made anappointment attheclinics. The other patients simply had an idea that theclinics might offer some method which might prove effective. Animportant theme indiscussions oftherelative efficacy ofdifferent techniques was thedistinction aquarter ofthe respondents between the cure of abasic underlying problem and the mere alleviation ofsymptoms. These data support Stoeckle and Zola's (1972) assertion that unrealistic expecta tions have led toconsiderable unwillingness toembark onany long-term course oftreatment which will not lead to acomplete cure. Patients are unenthusiastic about treatment which guarantees atbest only remission, control, orrelief. This was observed even invery elderly patients ingreat pain. The main thing isthat Ifeel most of my problems are psychosomatic inorigin. I need to know how todeal with stress. I don't want tojust take tranquilizers. (Doris Short, age 35). They [doctors |don't always get root (May Sne 11ing, age 85).113 The distinction between fundamental cure and superficial relief was often tied to anegative atti tude toward drugs prescribed byphysicians. asindeveloping countries dis cussed previously, isthat such medications may be powerful inalleviating symptoms; however, these drugs are both ineffective incorrecting the funda mental problem and dangerous because ofharmful side effects oraddiction. Infact, aside from failure oforthodox medicine tosatisfactorily deal with a problem, the wish toavoid medication was the second most common reason cited for deciding tousealterna tive techniques. Objections tothe use ofdrugs were often violent and emotional. For many people inthis sample medication seems tosymbolize the whole nega tive shadow side ofmedicine --itsability toharm we11astoheal, its dangerous and fearful aspect. Ofthemidlife respondents, 86.3% mentioned some kind ofnegative attitude toward medication; 56.6% ofthe older respondents did so. Reasons given for opposition todrugs varied. Lots ofwomen get hooked into tranquilizers and other things because they're prescribedoriginally bydoctors. (Rose Mason, age 35). Some people are heavily dependent onchemical medicine sowhen you put anatural herb inthe body itmay not work--something iswrong with their body chemistry. (Joyce Winters, age 35).114 a11kinds ofmedicine and Ithink itcan needles stuck inmy back. Ijust want tofeel may natural self and see what shape I'm in. (Alice Baynes, age 62). [speaking ofhigh blood pressue }Ihaven't taken medicine in 12years and want totry totreat this without medicine. Mybelief is that medicine would control the symptom, but Iwant todomore than that. (Wayne Johnson, age 57). There's something about chemotherapy that isn't good. Itkills cancer butitisn't good. (Catherine Monte, age 65). I'mstrictly against those pain pills andthings; I've seen too many people get hooked onthem. Iwon't take drugs. That's why [Dr. F.Iand Iparted company --he was just giving meValium and Ididn't even know it atthe time. Those kinds ofdrugs are unnecessary inmost cases. (Harold Taylor, age 73). Seeing mymother and somany older people, they seem tohave somany problems. Ifeelit's from the medication. Itmay help ithas sosick and Ishy away fromitasmuch aspossible. (Jane Armstrong, age 57). When asked ifthey would hesitate totake aspirin for amild headache, 52.8% ofthe older group and 59.1% of the younger group answered \"yes.\" Objections to aspirin paralleled objections tothe other drugs: fulside-effects, possible addiction, and 1ack of effectiveness tocure the underlying problem. Although not specifically questioned about theharm subject, 4midlife and 5older respondents mentioned115 some kind offear ofornegative attitude toward surgery. Patients' anxieties about incompetent doc tors have already been discussed. These data point tothe conclusion that modern Orthodox medicine is no exception tothegeneralization which emerges from anthropological studies of1ess technologically developed cultures that medicine isregarded ambiva 1ently, with fear and aswell astrust initsability onthroughout recorded history. . . . The patients who have left usdocuments often treat the physician as apotential danger towhich one must respond cautiously and whom one must always beready toevade.\" (Freidson, 1961). For most ofthis century, asmedi cine generated one seeming miracle after another, this shadow side ofmedicine was unacknowledged and not dealt with. The reemergence of arealization of medicine's negative potential, after along period of unbalanced positive regard, ismore likely tobe a factor inincreased incidence ofthe doctor. Itisprobable that ifless complex cultures had the same involved litigation structures asdoes American society, shamans there would besued formalpractice noless often than116 are physicians here. The data point tothe conclusion that, for people inthis sample atleast, alternative medicine arouses less fear ofpossible harm than does orthodox medicine. The reasons for this can only behypothesized atthis point. Perhaps alternative medicine isseen asless potent than orthodox andalternative practitioners as 1ess elite and distant than are physicians. People may feel they have more control over \"natural\" altern ative methods. Oritmay bethat people are merely less familiar with alternative medicine, which for most patients lacks unconscious childhood associations. Anattraction ofalternative medicine highlighted byapproximately three quarters ofthe midlife group and one quarter ofthe older group was itsperceived efficacy inpreventing aswell ascuring disease. midlife respondents emphasized the general impor tance ofpreventive medicine; most felt that, through the proper measures, aperson would beable toalmost totally prevent a11disease. What I'm looking for now issomeone who will te11mewhat Ineed todotokeep from going back tohim, and Iwasn't getting that. (E1ena Vargas, age 33). For many ofthese people, faith intheefficacy of preventive alternative medicine seems tohave replaced117 lost faith incurative orthodox medicine. Such ex pectations are hard todisprove. If aperson gets sick, itishis own fault--he did not take a11pos sible precautions. The techniques themselves are not subject todoubt. Onthe other hand, iforthodox medicine fails tocure, that isindisputable, and is the responsibility ofthe physician. Akey factor underlying theentire previous dis comprising perceived physio 1ogical aspects oftreatment thedistinction between cure ideas of disease causation and the nature ofhealth. Since the major factor inselection among medical alternatives is not effectiveness per se, but perceived effectiveness, itisimportant tolook atthe conceptions underlying this evaluation. Physicians operate 1argely onthe basis ofestablished scientific theories ofdisease from such disciplines asmicrobiology, immunology, and pathology. Ideas ofhealth and disease held bypatients inthis sample, however, were more congruent with doc trines advocated byvarious alternative practitioners than with concepts taught tomedical students. Patients inthis sample desired treatment that was118 effective interms oftheir body need calcium toworkright. (Mary age 85). During the course oftheinterviews, 72.8% ofthe midlife respondents and 56.6% ofthe older respondents spontaneously mentioned insome context that social and emotional factors had asignificant bearing on health. Usually this took the form ofemphasizing the importance ofmaintaining apositive state ofmind, beinoptimistic, and shunning negative emotions. Iattribute most i11ness when I'm sick to an emotional problem. IfI'm happy and not getting much sleep and running mybody down, Istill don't get acold. I've noticed the times Iget colds seem tobewhen I'mun happy orworried about something. (LaticiaMiller, age 36). Mental health isvery influential onyour physical health. Things like anger, loneli ness, depression can bring onphysical prob lems; you can create even accidents. (Wayne Johnson, age 57). Respondents were asked ifanillness could becured solely through faith orbelief; 81.8% ofthemidlife group and 56.6% ofthe older group said this was possible. A11participants were also requested tocomplete I rthe sentence \"People usually get sick because The overwhelming consensus which emerged from this119 question was that people have responsibility fortheir own health and can prevent disease. Anactive stance can and should betaken against i11ness. Disease is not somuch by\"germs\" orother ofcare lessness, lack ofeffort, bad mental states, oroverexertion. Below are some repre sentative completions ofthis sentence. oftentimes their own bad personal habits ineating, drinking, exercise, sex, etc. (Roberta Coventry, age 34). they take intoo much fortheir bodies to deal with .(Doris Short, age 35). they don't practice preventive medicine. (Mark Conrad, age 35). they don't take care ofthemselves (Laura Reeves, age 34; Charles Stein, age 34; Elena Vargas, age 33; E11en Hart, age age 72; TomBillings, age 72). Iguess, too much unhappiness, misery. (JuliaBillings, age 72). Three people inthe sentence completion mentioned poor environment as acause ofdisease, one each mentioned here dity and trauma, and two cited germs. Noone stated inthis context that aging was related to sickness, although atother points inthe interview a minority ofthe older respondents theorized their problems might beinsome way related totheir age. No120 one, however, thought their symptoms could beattributed solely toadvancing age. The fundamental beliefs ofthese respondents as related tothe basic nature ofdisease are quite favor able, then, totheattitude that alternative medical techniques arepotentially effective. Alternative medicine accords quite well with patients' ideas of effective treatment, since itspractitioners sooften emphasize concepts such astherelation ofenergy to health and disease, the need forprevention, the impor tance ofnutrition, and the harmfulness ofdrugs. Orthodox medical theories ofcause and appropriate treatment for disease are notuniversally accepted by the lay American public. Koos\" (1954) finding in asample quite distant intime and place from that inthis research that there was widespread belief inthe need totake care ofone self toprevent illness suggests that this amendment ofthe orthodox \"germ theory ofdisease\" along the 1ines ofindividual responsibility may indeed byan American universal, perhaps related tothe more general American values ofactivity and individualism. Suchman (1972b) reports that in aNew York City sample etiology ofdisease was viewed largely interms ofthose factors increasing causal agents121 orprocesses. Inastudy of160arthritis sufferers, Elder (1973) found that lower class patients were like lytotake responsibility for their condition. These people explained their arthritis asdue tothe violation ofoneofthe numerous preventive measures -a person should take, such asstaying warm oravoiding overexertion. Helman (1978), aBritish physician, shows tofittheir needs. \"Although the terms are borrowed from biomedicine, folk theories ofGerms are rooted inthe folk c.1assification of Fevers andChills, modern microbiology.\" (Ibid.; p.118). Doctors, however, usually goalong with rather tochange their patients' con ceptions ofthese illnesses, sothat orthodox medical models ofdisease are functionally closer topatients' beliefs than would seem atfirst glance tobethe case. isthat the estimated ...biomedicine atthe general practitioner 1eve 1ismore flexible than had been realised; that process of\"negotiation\" atthecon122 sultation. model tothe folk model, insome respects, than totheofficial model ofbiomedicine that exists inhospital, medical schools, and medical textbooks.\" (Ibid.; p.112). Thus, the role conceptions ofdisease play inthe decision toseek alternative medical care isstill animportant question for further investigation. Findings from the past few studies inthe United States relating toperceived physiological aspects altern ative medical care are congruent with the results of this study. The large National Analysts survey (1972) highlighted the importance ofobserved effectiveness inthe use ofwhat they call \"questionable\" health practice. Over one third oftheir sample said they would go on using amedicine they thought had helped them even if adoctor said itwas worthless ;over one tenth said they would try amedicine afriend said had helped him even if adoctor said itwas worthless. In ahypothetical \"cancer cure\" controversy pitting the judgement of\"most scientists and doctors\" that the cure isworth 1ess against the testimony of afew people who claim itsaved their lives, nearly one quarter ofthe sample sided against the experts. This survey also found that anorientation towhat they123 ca.11ed \"super health\" was related to atendency to use alternative medicine. This orientation, also quite manifest inthe quotations from thedisserta tion research, isthat good health issomething beyond the average which aperson must take definite measures toachieve ;just because adoctor does not recognize one's symptoms asdisease and pronounces that nothing iswrong does not mean thepatient feels healthy. Concern with the results oftreatment was a1so re vealed inthe greater impatience for results found in the National Analysts survey among users ofalternative medicine; these people were more likely toagree that amedication which does not help right away probably will not help atall. The large majority ofregular health food users surveyed gave reasons related tothe biological effects offood asthe reason fortheir nutritional habits. Interest inand use of isrelated to patients who elect toreceive acupuncture dosoas alast resort (Turban and Urlich, 1978). Astudy ofacupuncture patients in New York found that most ofthese patients did not want tokeep taking pain killing drugs because ofthe124 side -effects and were not satisfied with what con ventional medicine can offer inthe case ofchronic, painful illness (Shibutani, 1973). The majority of growth center users studied byLieberman and Gardner (1976) professed instrumental goals ofobtaining help with personal problems. Respondents in aCleveland survey (Harris and Guten, 1979) emphasized the impor tance ofpreventive measures taken bythe individual toprotect his own health. Jones (1949) concludes that much ofthe reputation offolk practitioners rests onthe fact they are given credit for bringing about cures after aphysician had failed to doso. The two main reasons given byKoos\" (1954) sample for seeking achiropractor's help was that arelative or friend had found thechiropractor helpful and that the doctor had not been able tohelp. Major reasons offered for making achange to achiropractor after using adoctor included: the physician treated the patient with nosuccess; the physican said nothing was wrong with thepatient, and the physician prescribed anoperation. The most frequently given reasons for rejecting the services of achiropractor a11related toperceived lack ofefficacy orquality ofchiroprac tic treatment. Studying aperiod early inthis century, Kaufman (1971) concludes the main factor inthe success12.5 ofhomeopathy was the lack ofeffectiveness diseases ofthe time. Studies ofthe revival oftraditional medicine in highly industrialized modern Japan, where Western orthodox medicine has long been dominant, also support the importance ofeffectiveness ininfluencing the decision toseek alternatives toorthodox medicine. Lock's (1978, 1980) extensive fieldwork revealed that patients who attend clinics offering East Asian medicine will have usually visited their family doctor first of a11, and then turned tothe traditional system when they find little relief from modern medi cine orwhen they experience unwanted side reactions. Otsuka (1976) also concludes amajor reason for the increasing popularity oftraditional medicine inmodern Japan isthe occurrence ofserious side-effects from synthetic drugs. Press (1973) found inmodern Seville, Spain that most patients who seek alternative curers are oftwo types: 1)those either medically incurable, impatient after 1engthy medical treatment with little result, orchronically ill, and 2)those seeking an alternative to along, costly, oranxiety-producing course ofmedical treatment recommended bytheir physicians. The data thus establish that concern for thephysio126 logical aspects oftreatment is amajor factor in patient decision toseek alternative medical treatment. This set ofvariables isalso ofsome ,although 1esser, importance Davis Medical Centers, asopposed toanother source of alternative care. Asked whey they selected these specific clinics, 68% ofthemidlife group and 4.8% ofthe older group mentioned some reason tothink they would receive superior care atthese sites. The most frequently named consideration-- related by 7midlife and 5older patients --was that these clinics helped someone else orhadbeen recommended byanauthorita tive source asoffering good quality care. Three midlife respondents and 4older respondents had cause tothink there were especially effective doctors attheclinics. Two older patients said they went totheclinics because they were 1icensed and approved bythestate for the services they offered. Three midlife individuals 1iked the fact the clinic was affiliated with an MD as we11asalternative healers; two other people inthis age group thought Mayfield orDavis would have good facilites and many services because they were clinics.127 3) Type ofdisease Incontrast toperceived psychological aspects of care, the variables included inthe category \"type of disease\" had more indirect than direct effect onthe decision toseek alternative medical care. Previous discussion ofthe data isentirely consistent with the finding that people seek alternative care for the following types ofproblems: 1)disease that cannot beeffectively treated byorthodox medicine, 2) problems not recognized ornot defined asdisease by orthodox medicine, 3)problems that orthodox medicine can control only through surgery orprolonged and heavy use ofdrugs. The overwhelming majority ofproblems this sample brought toMayfield and Davis Medical Centers for treatment fall into one ofthese three categories. Patients frequently sought help formultiple problems. The most prevalent component ofthefirst group ofproblems --diseases that cannot beeffectively treated byorthodox medicine --inthis sample was incurable pain, which among theelderly was frequently linked toarthritis and among the younger people to sports injuries orpast accidents. Sixteen elderly and tenmidlife respondents came totheclincs for treatment ofchronic pain which had not been alleviated byprior orthodox medical treatment orwhich respondents128 hypothesized could not beeffectively treated by orthodox medicine. The other problems which had been treated before byorthodox medicine without success and were then presented attheclinics were uncontrolled movement ofthe head andneck (one elderly patient), digestive problems (2elderly and 4midlife patients), mental problems (1elderly and 3midlife patients), dizziness and loss ofbalance (2elderly patients), menstrual problems (1midlife patient), alung problem (1midlife patient), and bent spine (1midlife patient). Other problems presented attheclinic were not recognized ordefined asdisease byorthodox medicine, but were so thought ofbythepatients. Many physi cians would classify these complaints aspersonal or nonmedical problems which donot involve organic pathology and hence are not suitable for orthodox medical treatment. Inthis sample these included weight problems (5midlife patients), fatigue orlack ofenergy (1elderly and \"toxemia\" (1midlife and smoking (1midlife patient). Inthe final category oftypes ofcomplaints, patients brought problems which are usually treated with drugs toalternative medicine totry tocontrol them without surgery orprolonged medication. The129 most common complaint ofthis type was high blood pressure (4elderly and 1midlife patient); the only other such problem inthe sample was anelderly woman with parathyroid trouble. Consonant with the nature oftheir problems, the majority ofpatients brought complaints they had been suffering with forquite along time tothe Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers. Ascan beseen from Table 10, the majority ofboth groups had their symptoms for over ayear before attending the clinics.130 Table 10.

How people rated their health status incomparison toothers oftheir age isshown in Table 11. The older group tended torate their health more negatively, but inboth age groups there were some people ineach category.131 Table 11. How respondents ratedtheir health. Rating Mid 1ife Older group group Very good 5 5 (22.8%) (21.7%) Good 11 5 (50.0%) (21.7%) Fair (26.1%) Asignificant finding isthat thegreat majority of both groups stated that health problems interfered with their functioning inthe 1ast year; 91.3% ofthe older group and 72.8% ofthe group said health problems made itharder for them todothings that they wanted. Onepossiblity which emerges from the data isthat itis, in1arge part, this interference with functioning that motivates people toseek medical care at a11, and theinability oforthodox medicine to satisfactorily treat these complaints that then motivates some people tothen seek alternative care. In afurther attempt todiscover the role type of disease plays inthe decision touse alternative medicine, all respondents were posed the following question: \"What sources ofmedical care would you consider using for the following problems?\" The choices132 were nomedical care (not counted inthe average), would seek alternative medical care first (weighted as1), would consider alternative sources ofmedicine inconjunction with adoctor or ahospital, but would seek help from adoctor orhospital first (weighted as 2), and would not consider using alternative sources ofmedicine (weighted as3). Thus, the lower aperson's average onthis question, the more favorable hewas toseeking alternative, asopposed toorthodox care. The problems respondents were asked toconsider were acommon cold, ulcers, cancer that was detected early, cancer that was terminal, flu with high fever, a sprained ankle, insomnia, allergies, emotional prob lems, hearing loss, arthritis, abroken arm, and heart disease. Interesting and consistent differences between age groups and between diseases emerged in response tothis question. The midlife group was much more 1ikely toconsider seeking alternative medical care first forallprob 1ems; the older group overwhelmingly favored consult ing adoctor orhospital first. The average ofall responses toall diseases was 1.74 for themidlife group and 2.31 for the older group. Twelve ofthe 22midlife respondents had averages that fell inthe range of1.25-1. 75; only three had averages over 2.00. Among the older respondents, only three had averages133 under 2.00 and twelve had averages inthe range of 2.25to3.00. For both groups ofparticipants Iaveraged the responses tothis question bydisease, and considered which diseases fell above the average for a11diseases and which below for each age group. There was ahigh degree ofconsistency between age groups. Those medical problems which were atorabove the average inboth groups (that is, problems which respondents were more likely totake tophysicians and 1ess likely totake toalternative practitioners) were heart disease, abroken arm, hearing loss, asprained ankle, flu with high fever, and cancer ofearly detection. These were a11 problems which are clearly mechanical orinfectious innature orare serious andpotentially 1ife-threatening. Those diseases which both groups were more 1ikely toseek alternative medica1 attention for were the common cold, cancer that was terminal, insomnia, allergies, emotional problems, andarthritis. Except for terminal cancer, which bydefinition is adisease orthodox medicine cannot cure, these are a11 chronic problems ofrather nebulous etiology which are not life-threatening. A11 are problems for which orthodox medicine has nogenerally recognized effective treatment. The only disease for which there wasdis134 agreement between the age groups was ulcers; the younger group was more like lytoseek alternative care and the older group orthodox care for this problem than for the others asked about. Itmay bethat themidlife people perceive ulcers asmore stress -related and the older people asmore mechanical innature. Thus there isclose correspondence between answers given tothe question ofhypothetical care -seeking for various problems and the nature ofcomplaints patients actually presented atthe Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers. Respondents said they would seek and did seek alternative medical care for problems ofnebulous etiology that are not life -threatening and which are not effectively treated byorthodox medicine. The fact that respondents inboth age groups agreed that serious, acute problems should receive orthodox medi cal care indicates, however, that these people do regard orthodox medicine asbeing generally more potent and effective than alternative medicine. Most indi viduals inthis sample are unlikely toendanger them selves bytaking alife-threatening problem to aprac titioner who cannot deal with it, seeking care from aphysician only when such aid istoo late tobeof value. Flexible use ofmedical care among alternatives was the rule rather than the exception. Thus, people clearly discriminate between types ofdiseases; this13.5 category ofvariables isanimportant determinant of the decision care. ofdisease was of 1ittle ornoimportance, however, inthe choice tospecifically use the Mayfield or Davis Medical Centers rather than another source of alternative care. 4) Cognitive andaffective aspects ofmedical care Under cognitive and affective aspects ofmedical care are subsumed awhole set ofdiverse variables whose influence onthe decision toseek alternative medical care isboth direct andindirect. Myfeeling isthat because this is arather emotionally charged area, past hypotheses ofmedical utilization have overinflated its importance and underrated theinflu ence ofthephysiological factors ofeffectiveness of medical care and type ofdisease. The following quota tions from two theorists illustrate this type of thinking. The patient wants time, sympathetic attention, and concern for himself as aperson. The physical examination orlaboratory test is acceptable insofar asitsuggests thorough - ness and indicates that the doctor istaking the complaint seriously, but thepatient has fewcriteria bywhich appropriateness with it it aninterest inhis individuality. (Eisenberg, 1977).136 Many patients with psychosomatic chronic and degenerative diseases, ortermi na1 i11nesses turn tounorthodox practitioners for asense ofhope, personal attention, phy -sical contact, or aregard for the whole person which seems tobeoverlooked inthetechnical concerns ofthe Western physician. - Many unorthodox practitioners seembetter able tocommunicate with patients,relating more closely tothe world view of thepatient, which isoften atsome distance from impersonal and technical ofmodern medicine. (Sobe 1,1979). Iwill consider this set offactors from several viewpoints: satisfaction with the cognitive and affective aspects oforthodox medical care, cognitive andaffective factors asdirect reasons for seeking alternative medical care, and such factors asin direct reasons for seeking alternative medical care. Just aspatients inthis sample regarded the efficacy ofphysicians with ambivalence, sothey manifested mixed feelings toward the personal quali ties ofdoctors. The majority ofrespondents mentioned both positive and negative experiences with andatti tudes toward the nonphysiological aspects oforthodox medical care and toward physicians themselves. Patients clearly differentiated different doctors and different sources ofmedical care interms offactors making for cognitive andaffective satisfaction. Some doctors have such anice personality;they're sincere, they really care. Alot of doctors don't care; they just want money. (Alice Baynes, age 62).137 Afew respondents, a11elderly, did make blanket condemnations of a11doctors oncognitive oraffective grounds. None ofthese people, however, were more positive tothe personal qualities ofalternative practitioners. The question ofhowsatisfaction with orthodox medical care affects utilization ofalterna tive medicine istherefore complex. The simply hypo thesis that with orthodox medicine 'sfailure and alternative practitioners isnot supported bythese data. Noone said they sought alternative care specifically toget personal attention orsocial support; noone said that alternative practitioners were ,ingeneral, better people than medical doctors. Itispossible that such considerations were ,unconsciously, the main motives for seeking alternative medical care, and that such conscious lygiven reasons asthe desire foreffective treatment were cover-ups for these less culturally acceptable motivations. Such ahypothesis would re quire detailed clinical evidence for support, and none isavailable either inthis study orintheliterature. Cognitive andaffective factors doenter ofthis dis - cussion isthat such factors donot have the overwhelm ing and unambiguous role sooften ascribed tothem.138 The younger group tended tobemore critical than the older ofthe nonphysiological aspects of orthodox medical care. This contrasts with the findings ofNational Analysts (1972) and Nutt brock and Kosberg (1980) that elderly people tend tobethe group most critical ofthe personal qualities of doctors. A11 respondents inthis sample were asked general questions about their experiences with doctors toelicit adiscussion about their attitudes inthis area. Half ofthe midlife group and 17.4% ofthe older group mentioned atsome time feeling rushed byphysi cians ornot receiving enough personal attention. About one third ofthe younger group and only one person in the older group described encountering doctors who were insulting, patronizing, too proud, orsexist. The older group was slightly more negative toward physicians inone respect. About one third ofthese respondents and one quarter ofthe younger respondents depicted doctors asgreedy, overpaid, and financially motivated. Although itisapparent that asubstantial proportion ofthe sample had atleast some negative attitudes toward and encounters with doctors, these same people a1so described doctors who took apersonal interest inthem, spent time with them, acted asfriends, did not care about money, orhad other desirable qualities.139 Except for afewbitterly negative elderly people, all the respondents felt itpotentially possible to seek thesatisfaction ofcognitive andaffective needs within orthodox medicine. Other studies are congruent with the results of this research. The large National Analysts survey (1972) found that those whoutilized chiropractors, homeopaths, ornaturopaths were not especially critical ofphysicians. In astudy ofdoctors and medical students, Ford etal. (1962) found that these professionals considered thedoctor-patient relationship ofcentral importance incases ofchronic disease. The dynamics ofthis ambivalence toward orthodox medicine have been discussed byGamson and Schuman (1963), King (1962), and Shuval (1971). These authors agree that negative feelings must inevitably accompany highly positive regard for andexpectations ofphysicians. Ambivalence isthe characteristic attitude and prestige isgranted tosomeone else, there are usually unconscious feelings ofjealousy that accompany it, of awish toshare some ofthe power that isgranted, and of afear ofthe consequences should itbemisused. Thus, although most poeple admire and look uptothe140 physician, they often feel hostile toward him, often for only slight cause.\" (King, 1962; p.173). Devi ation from high expectations and ideals can bequite disturbing. These authors also agree that the depen dence onthe doctor and threat tothe individual in times ofillness arouse strongly ambivalent feelings inpatients; the individual desires both tobecared for and toretain his cultura 11y valued independence. Some ofthemidlife patients inthis research explicitly made the point that physiological aspects oftreatment were more important than adoctor's personal qualities. Quality ofcare was highlighted asthe main consideration inchoosing apractitioner. Hewasn't the Iwas looking for. He was person. Iwent tohim for several years. Healways wouldn't goback tosee him. (Elena Vargas, age 33). They have the diagnosis and are doing every - thing they can soitreally doesn't matter who treats me. (Jerome Farthing, age 37). She's agood doctor. She's alittle aloof, but her knowledge makes upforthat. (E11en Hart, age 36). More common was theattitude ,also found byFreidson (1961), that acertain amount ofinterest inthepatient was aprerequisite for the delivery oftechnically satisfactory care. Cognitive andaffective considerations were direct141 factors inthe decision toseek alternative medical care for some ofthe respondents, particularly the younger patients. One person gave curiosity asone reason for trying alternative techniques. Several people mentioned that alternative medicine generated hope. Another respondent described adesire for knowledge ofthe body that could bebetter acquired from alternative practitioners. About one third ofthe midlife group and none ofthe older group mentioned the need fortreating the whole person, notjust abody part. Approximately one quarter ofthe midlife respon dents and one older respondent gave the desire tobe responsible for their health orthepossiblity of playing amore active role intheir own health care as apositive attraction ofalternative medicine. Afew respondents described cognitive andaffec tive considerations that favored utilization of orthodox over alternative medicine. One patient said the idea ofseeking alternative care aroused anxiety and fright because ofitsunfamiliarity. Another said shefelt depressed and out-of-place insome alternative settings, and found the ideas behind some alternative techniques incomprehensible. One respondent identified alternative medicine with \"those cults, sects --1ike the (Margarita Juare z,age 64).142 Other studies have also uncovered cognitive and affective factors directly influencing the decision toseek alternative medical care. Research onbirth alternatives inthe United States found that 67% of mothers interviewed said preferring amore personal atmosphere was afactor inthe decision tohave a home birth (Bauwens and Anderson, 1978). Reasons mentioned byKoos\" (1954) sample for seeing achiro - practor included the following: the physician orthe disease, chiropractice provided a new experience, and becoming friendly with thechiro practor. None ofthese explanations, however, were given with the same frequency asreasons relating to physiological aspects oftreat emnt. McCorkle (1961) states that chiropractic fits well into the idea and value system ofrural Iowans. Wardwell (1952) and Firman and Goldstein (1975) write that chiropractors are sought inorder to1egitimate aperson's entrance into the sick role when aphysician cannot orwill not doso. Iwill consider some cognitive and affective factors which may be indirectly related tothe de cision toobtain a1ternative medical care. These are familiarity with various forms ofmedical care, knowl14 3 edge ofalternative techniques, religious beliefs, and level ofstress. Theoretical considerations and past studies indicate that these variables may be related tomedical utilization. Rather than being people who were ignorant of orunfamiliar with orthodox medicine, thealternative medical patients inthis sample were individuals who tended tohave anabove average intimacy with ortho dox medicine. Respondents were asked how many times they sought medical care inthe last year; ingeneral, people aquestion. Ascan beseen inTable 12, even without taking under reporting into account, these patients tended tomake heavy use oforthodox medical care. Half themidlife respondents and over 90% of the elderly respondents had aregular source ofmedical care. These are people who are generally quite conscientious about going tothe doctor.14.4 Table 12. Use ofmedical care inthe previous year. Number oftimes sought Midlife O1der orthodox medical care group group prior tointerview 0-3 worked in ahealth related profession orhad amember oftheir immediate family who had. Thus, itseems that those who seek alternative medicine are people who are unusually familiar with orthodox medicine and have ahigh per sonal interest inthe field ofhealth. This intimate medicine may beanimportant factor inthese people's disillusion ment with this type ofcare. Several people did explicitly state that working in ahealth-related pro fession contributed totheir loss offaith inphysi cians. Inany tic idea ofthe 1imitations oforthodox medicine. People inthis with alternative aswe11asorthodox medicine.145 Alittle over half ofboth groups had obtained some form of a1ternative medical care at some time intheir lives before going tothe Mayfield orDavis Medical Centers. A11 themidlife respondents and 65% ofthe older respondents had ever bought anything at ahealth food store ;such anexperience could also contribute toatleast avague familiarity with alternative medicine. \"It seems clear that health food stores are not merely another place topurchase food. Instead, they are counter-culture establishments where under ground 1iterature isobtained, 'health\" events are publicized, and health advice isobtained (Markle decision-making isstill unclear (Tagliacozzo and Ima, 1970). In this sample, the midlife group ingeneral had amuch higher knowledge ofalternative medical techniques. A11 ofthemidlife respondents, but only 43.4% ofthe older respondents, said they had read any books or articles onalternative sources ortechniques of medical care; 40.9% ofthe midlife respondents and 17.4% ofthe older respondents had every gone toany seminars, classes, orlectures onalternative medicine. Patients were asked toname some techniques ofaltern ative medical care ;the midlife respondents were able tolist anaverage of5.2 techniques while anaverage of1.6tech rolfing. Those group correctly identified anaverage of2.2 techniques ; those inthe older group accurately described an average of .7techniques. However, 1evel ofknowledge varied widely within each group. Itappears that a wide range oflevels ofknowledge about alternative techniques themselves isconsistent with the decision toseek alternative medical care. Religious beliefs may be afactor inmedical healer, and may indirectly but strongly relate tosuch variables as conceptions ofhealth, disease, and the human body andbelief inone's ownability tocontrol one's own fate. Table 13shows the religious preferences of this sample.147 Table 13. Religious preferences ofrespondents. Religious preference Mid 1ife O1der group group Prote 10 (13.7%) (43.4%) 2 6 (9.0%) (26.4%) Russian Orthodox 0 1 (4.3%) Jewish 2 2 (9.0%) (8.7%) Other 3 1 (13.7%) (4.3%) None 12 3 (54.6%) (13.1%) The midlife participants were far more likely tobeaffiliated with any formal religion. However, about 60% ofboth groups said religion was important intheir daily lives. Despite their lack ofreligious preference, midlife respondents were twice as 1ikely tohave ever 17.4% ofthe older had previously sought such ahealer. From this sample itisnot possible todraw anygeneralizations about the religious beliefs ofusers ofalternative medicine, except tosay that such convictions may behighly variable and are not related inany simple way to medical decision-making.148 LaPatra (1978) found that individual's involve ment with alternative medicine most frequently began in aperiod ofhigh stress and specific trauma involving family orwork. However, people inthis sample differed widely inthe 1evel ofstress considered themselves tobeunder inthe year before seeking Mayfield orDavis Medical Centers. Respondents described stress levels atevery gradation from none toanexceptional amount. Older respondents tended to describe themselves asless happy onthe Bradburn scale than did midlife respondents, asisshown 1e14. Table 14. Happiness ofrespondents Level ofhappiness Mid 1ife Older group group Very happy 4 3 (18.2%) (13.1%) Pretty happy 14 8 (63.6%) (34.8%) Not too happy 4 12 (18.2%) (52.2%) Thus, although some ofthepatients were unhappy, negative people under alot ofstress, not a11respon dents byany means fell into this stereotype.14.9 Insum, cognitive and affective factors con tributed importantly, both directly andindirectly, tothe decision toseek alternative medical care. However, the operation ofthese variables was complex- - itwas not simply acase ofpeople looking for sym pathy orpersonal attention they felt was lacking inphysicians. Much more research isnecessary to clarify therelative importance and dynamics of this diverse group offactors inmedical decision making. For this sample, perceived physiological asepicts ofmedical care were more important than nonphysical aspects ininfluencing people toseek alternative medical care. Cognitive and affective factors were ofvery 1ittle importance inthe specific choice ofMayfield orDavis Medical Centers over other possible sources ofalternative care. Aninteresting phenomenon revealed bythese data About aquarter ofthemidlife group and 43.4% ofthe older group first heard about the Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers from friends orrelatives. The remaining majority found out about these clinics from impersonal sources --the referra 1number described above, theclinics' signs onthestreet. Several respondents inboth age\"groups indicated they would have preferred togoto aplace that was personally recommended, but did not have such areferral available. 5) Material factors Finally, material factors played asmall role in the decision toseek alternative medical care. Al though there was widespread dissatisfaction with such orthodox care ascost orwaiting time, concern for these factors was not amajor reason for obtaining alternative care. One midlife respondent said altern ative medicine was ,ingeneral, more convenient than orthodox care, and three midlife and one older respon dent said financial reasons influenced their decision toseek alternative care, which they saw asless expensive orless of a\"rip-off.\" One midlife and one older patient said alternative techniques cost the same asorthodox medicine. About one quarter ofboth groups said alternative medicine was too expensive orthat cost had deterred them from seeking alternative care inthepast. Thus, ifanything, material factors either did not differentiate different kinds ofmedica 1 care for most ofthe sample orwere more anincentive decided toseek a1ternative care for any ofthe reasons discussed in this chapter, material factors were major influences onthe choice ofspecifically where togo,especially for the older group. One midlife respondent and about onefifth oftheelderly respondents directly listed theability tousetheir public orprivate medical insurance coverage asthe reason they selected May field orDavis Medical Centers. However, since a far higher percentage ofthe sample had and used such insurance, which isnot accepted bymost sources of alternative care, itisreasonable toinfer that this factor played animportant role intheselection of Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers. Nine percent of the midlife group and alittle over one quarter of the older group said they chose the Mayfield orDavis Medical Centers because these clinics were in aconven ient location for them. About onefifth ofboth groups said they did not use another source ofalternative care which they would rather have gone tobecause this other place was inconvenient orinaccessible for them. The Decision toContinue Alternative Treatment Intheir large survey, National Analysts (1972) concluded that many people engage inalternative medical techniques just assomething \"worth atry,\"152 rather than from any coherent set ofbeliefs. Inthis research, about half ofeach age group mentioned specifica 11y that they viewed their initial visit to Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers as atrial ofthe clinics, the techniques offered there, orboth. Ijust wanted tocheck them [Mayfield] out. (Laura Reeves, age 34). Inever tried acupuncture and always wanted to. (Rose Mason, age 35). I'd never gone to aholistic center and being back inthe States Iwanted totryit.(Laticia Miller, age 36). Ithought I'd take seeifthey '11help. (Marlene 74). Iwanted totry them out tosee if Icould get healed. (Alice Baynes, age 62). Itisclear from the interviews that alarge number of the respondents who did not specifically say they were going totheclinics as atrial were ,infact, doing so. Since the majority ofthe sample viewed their first visit orfirst fewvisits tothe Mayfield or Davis Medical Centers as aprovisional trial, the decision tocontinue ordiscontinue alternative treat ment rested very much onthis initial experience. Because alternative techniques 1ack general acceptance, anexamination ofthe 1iterature oninnovation can greatly illuminate this process. Rogers (1962) and Coleman etal. (1966) identify five stages ofthe153 adoption ofaninnovation byany given individual. These are awareness, interest, evaluation, trial, and adoption. Inthe awareness stage, the person is first exposed tothe innovation. Attheinterest stage, the person becomes interested inthe new idea and actively seeks information about it. A\"mental trial\" occurs atthe evaluation stage ;the individual mentally applies the innovation tohis present and anticipated situation and then decides whether ornot totryit. The last two stages are ofprimary interest in this research. Atthetrial stage, the individual uses the innovation on asmall scale inorder to determine itsutility inhis ownsituation. This is precisely what theinitial visit tothe Mayfield or Davis Medical Centers generally constituted. No matter how convincing the evidence for theutility of something new, most individuals will not adopt an innovation without trying itfirst on aprobationary basis. The results ofthetrial are very important in the adoption- rejection decision. Inthe adoption stage, the individual decides tomake sustained use ofthe innovation inthe future. However, even after fully adopting aninnovation, aperson may atany time decide todiscontinue its use. Cultural values influence154 not only theinitial adoption orrejection ofan innovation, but also how the new idea will beinte grated into the existing way oflife. The adoption process issimilar tolearning and other types of decision-making. Aconsideration ofthe innovation process as applied tothis research iscomplicated bythe fact that different respondents were trying, adopting, orrejecting different elements ofalternative medi cine. AsMenze 1(1960) points out, changes inmaterial culture (adoption ofthe techniques themselves) may befar more easily accomplished than changes innon material culture (the conceptions and ideas behind the use oftechniques). Some respondents made itclear they were not interested inthe idea systems they perceived asaccompanying alternative techniques. Ididn't really want holistic medicine. A11 Iwant todoisseen anacupuncturist. (Norma Garfield, age 55). However, asdiscussed above, most respondents had already strongly adopted some ideas related toaltern ative medicine (such asthe trying tofind aspecific locale, practitioner, ortechnique to adopt toput these practice. Thus adecision155 not toreturn tothe Mayfield orDavis Medical Centers was innoway synonymous with adecision to adopt orreject alternative medicine itself. innovativeness relates toage isanimportant consideration inthis research. \"According toour life is aprogress from innovation toconservatism ...Yet thereality may be quite the the self-confidence ofyouth may beanexpression ofits conservatism, while itisthe old who must, and do, continually innovate. The onset ofold age can almost bedefined asthe time inour 1ife when our resources todefend usagainst radical changes inourlife.\" aresponse tothe loss, orthreatened loss, of ameaningful structure. Innovation is adifficult, uncertain, often painful process which anindividual undertakes only when itisforced upon him. Older people are more likely toconfront the kinds of 1osses and crises in which previous ways ofcoping are inadequate orno longer available and innovation must beundertaken. Infact, the older group inthis sample was consider ably more 1ikely toadopt the use ofMayfield and Davis Medical Centers, ortogive theclinics alonger trial before rejecting their use. While respondents inthe midlife group made anaverage of5.3visits to156 the clinics before terminating treatment, respondents inthe older group made anaverage of9.5visits. 01der respondents were less likely tomake only one visit totheclinics, and were more likely Centers group (31.9%) 9 (40.9%) 3 (13.7%) 2 (9%) 1 (4.4%) 7 (30.5%) These differences innumber ofvisits may be more related tothe problems presented rather than to ageitself. However, even ifthis isthe case, the fact that the older respondents were willing topersist intreatment over anaverage ofalmost 10visits is and toadopt these techniques.157 Two close 1yinterre 1ated factors overwhelmingly orreject, tocontinue orterminate treatment bytheclinics. satisfaction with the c1inics --will be examined indetail inthe next two chapters. However, the choice ofadopting orrejecting theclinics was not always completely inthe hands ofrespondents. Eight midlife and five older respondents indicated that they would prefer tocontinue treatment atthe Mayfield orDavis Medical Centers but were prevented from doing this formaterial reasons ofmoney, time, or distance. Very few, ifany, ofthese people were solimited, though, that they could not have continued treatment had they put ahigh enough priority onit tomake thetrade-offs necessary for doing so. Material barriers were perceived where there was noresolution toovercome them. Aconsideration ofthe decision tocontinue alternative treatment thus merges with the following two chapters. Summary Inthis chapter Ihave considered the general question ofmedical choice inboth developing and industrialized countries with pluralistic medical systems. Ananalysis oftheliterature reveals five158 major classes ofvariables which account for individual selection among various medical alternatives. These favors are the symbolic component ofmedicine, perceived physiological aspects oftreatment, type ofdisease, affective and andmaterial reasons. The complex interplay ofthese variables inagiven cultural matrix and individual situation determines the path asick person and his family will trave 1through the medical system. These five factors illuminate the decision to seek and tocontinue alternative medical care atthe Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers byrespondents in this study. The single most important class ofvariables inthe decision toseek alternative care was perceived physiological factors; this finding iscontrary tothe prevalent hypothesis that cognitive andaffective factors are the most crucial insituations ofmedical choice. A11 five factors were examined indetail as they manifested themselves inthe dynamics ofchoice for this sample. There were fewsubstantial differences between the two age groups inmaking the decision to seek alternative care. Caution ingeneralizing these findings too widely stems from arecognition ofthe differences between various medical systems and the diversity within any one medical system.1.59 Chapter 4 The Effectiveness ofAlternative Medicine Self-Evaluation ofHealth The fact that the only measures ofboth general health status and specific symptomatic improvement in this sample come from self- ratings raises animportant methodological issue. Theliteratue ontheself evaluation ofhealth generally supports the values of these measures. Although respondents' andphysicians' ratings ofhealth are notidentical, they arecorrelated; the twoperspectives are complementary, each giving a unique and valuable insight into aperson's health status. Under ideal circumstances, both measures would beincluded inthis type ofstudy; however, in this research only respondents' ratings were available. Abrief review ofthe 1iterature will provide some insight into both the merits and 1imitations ofthis IleaSUTe . Alarge and long-term study byMaddox (1962, 1964, 1973) ofelderly volunteers 1iving inthe are aofDurban, North Carolina, ofhealth have utility as ameasure160 ofhealth insurvey research where objective measures are not feasible. This study found apersistent, positive congruence between physicians' and respondents' health ratings; the two agreed about two-thirds ofthe time. Moreover, self-health ratings tended tobe a better predictor offuture doctor's ratings than the reverse. Whenever there was adiscrepancy, the tendency was for the individual tooverestimate his health. Another study ofinstitutionalized and commun ity people over 65(Fillengaum, 1979) confirms that among theelderly, self-assessments ofhealth do health status and soare ofvalue insurveys. Linn etal. (1980) found that self assessed health among the elderly was highly related to aperson's level offunctioning. Astudy of ayounger group found that among college students, perceived health was significantly correlated with current health status (Garrity etal., 1978). Analysis of four data sets byTess 1er and Mechanic (1978) led to the conclusion that physical health status has a 1arger influence onperceived health status than does psychological distress. The results ofother research conflict with the above findings. In astudy ofadults over age 50, the correlation between self andphysician's health ratings was only .33(Friedsam and Martin, 1963).16.1 Astudy ofthe very old found only thedoctor's assessment of thepatient's health (Linn etal., 1978). Tissue (1972) concluded that among the aged, self-evaluations ofhealth are more closely related tosubjective factors than toobjectively verifiable criteria of physical condition. Thus, although there is own health and the ratings which would have been obtained from aphysician's assessment, it isnot possible tosay how high thecorrelation would probably be. These self-evaluations ofhealth must be treated asvaluable measures intheir ownright, not aspoor substitutes for amore desirable \"objective\" rating. Other theorists have supported this position. Suchman (1972a) argues that subjective reports ofhealth have predictive value indeterming how an individual will behave inthe face ofillness. Berkano vic etal. (1974) and Kirscht (1971) discuss the point that physician's determinations ofhealth are not the only valid ones; health isnot defined solely by scientific-technical criteria. Thus, aninherent weakness inthe survey asanindex ofhealth isthat respondents cannot move outside their own experience162 and be1iefs. However, that weakness can bemade avirtue ifthe focus ofthe isonthe very things dent cantell us--his complaints, the extent towhich hehas knowledge and motives that we wish him tohave ,the way heviews variousphysiological states, his health practices, his layreferral systems, his views about various kinds ofpractitioners. Such informa tion can provide asound basis for program evaluation and planning but only when we are willing toadmit that theclient's views have aninherent validity despite their noncorrespondence professional views.(Kirscht, 1971; p.525). The focus arespondent Respondents are qualified toevaluate theeffective - ness ofalternative medicine for their particular problems tothe extent that such treatment enables them tofeel and function better orleads tochanges inhealth beliefs, practices, and awareness. Further more, themajority ofproblems presented atthe May field and Davis Medical Centers primarily involved subjective distress, not measurable organic pathology. Therefore, subjective evaluations ofimprovement are indeed the most valid indicators ofthe effectiveness ofalternative treatment for these types ofcomplaints.163 Effect onSymptoms ofAlternative Treatment Although many respondents reported onthe results ofpast alternative treatment, Iwill consider only the effects oftreatment atMayfield and Davis Medical Cen ters. Using the retrospective data would leave too many variables uncontrolled orunknown toprovide any valid basis for comparison orevaluation. Iwill consider both thepositive and negative consequences oftreatment at the Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers, and examine the psychophysiological means bywhich these changes may beeffected. Idichotomized the respondents into those whoexperi enced low ornoimprovement insymptoms after treatment at Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers and those who reported moderate orhigh improvement insymptoms after treatment atthese clinics. Two respondents were excluded from this analysis because they stated nosymptoms were related totheir usage oftheclinics; they sought orno improvement andseventeen (39.6%) described moderate or high improvement after the completion oftreatment at the clinics orafter several months oftreatment. I looked atthe relationship ofsymptomatic improvement to seven variables: age group, oftreatment, \u00ba164 and sex were not connected toamount ofsymptomatic improvement; midlife and older adults, men and women were equally likely to benefit from alternative treatment. The other five variables, however, were related toeffectiveness of treatment. Dr. Blake, who usually combined acupressure and dietary advice with chiropractic manipulation, appeared tooffer byfar the most effective treatment. Fifty-six percent ofhispatients experienced moderate orhigh improvement insymptoms. Only about one-quarter of the acupuncture patients and one-fifth ofthose who received any other type oftreatment reported this degree ofrelief. Itmust bekept inmind that many used more than onepractitioner attheclinics, anditwas not possible todetermine who was responsible for Inthis case, Iassigned the credit forbenefit orlack ofimprovement moderate orhigh relief, andhalf low ornoimprovement. The clinics were most beneficial intreating digestive problems and fatigue; two-thirds ofthose receiving treatment for these problems improved. Alternative medicine tended tobeineffective for high blood pressure, weight loss, and the miscellaneous other complaints brought1.65 for treatment. Except for those with pain, however, the numbers ofpatients with these various problems was very small, and these results must beregarded astentative. Those who reported significant relief from treament tended tohave hadtheir symptoms for ashorter period oftime before receiving alternative treatment, asisshown inTable 16. However, even those people who had symptoms for over ten years could benefit substantially from alternative treatment. Table 16. Duration ofproblem and improvementafter treatment. Duration ofproblem before seeking Mayfield orDavis Medical Centers 1ess than one month one month toone year one year tofive years five years toten years over ten yearsPatients with low or no improvement 1 (3.9%) 4 (15.4%) 6 (23.1%) 5 (19.3%) 10 (38.5%)Patients with moderate or high improve - ment 3 (17.7%) 5 (29.5%) 3 (17.7%) 1 (5.9%) 5 (29.5%) Those who reported orhigh made and average of12. 2visits toMayfield orDavis-*z - Ss166 Medical Centers, while reported low orno improvement made anaverage ofonly 4.8visits. If alternative medicine isindeed effective, then itis nosurprise that those who received more treatment reported more benefit. Over one -third ofthose who reported low ornoimprovement made only onevisit totheclinics; these people may hardly besaid to have even received treatment. Onthe other hand, it ispossible that those who did not benefit made fewer visits totheclinics precisely because the treatment they were receiving was not effective. Aprolonged course oftreatment was not necessary forrelief; over one third ofthose who experienced moderate orhigh improvement only 1ow Patients with Mayfield orDavis ornoimprovement moderate orhigh Medical Centers improvement 1 (34.7%) 2to 5 11 6 (42.3%) (35.3%) 6to (17.7%) 11to (8.6%) (35.3%) About two-thirds ofthose who experienced moderate orhigh reported they had genera 11ypositive initial expectancies ofrelief from alternative treatment, while only about one third ofthose who experienced 10w ornoimprovement had such favorable having noinitial expectancies ornot forseeing help visited the clinics. However, itmust bekept inmind that respondents could not beasked about their initial expectancies until after they had already received some treatment, and that reports ofthese expectancies therefore contain aretrospective Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers also had negative side-effects for many patients in this sample. Although respondents were not directly questioned about negative side-effects oftreatment, 59.1% ofthemidlife group and 47.8% ofthe older group reported such undesirable concomitants ofalternative medicine. Pain accompanying treatment was the major problem for 43.9% ofthe midlife respondents and 81.9% ofthe older respondents reporting negative side-effects. The rest ofthese respondents mentioned other problems resulting from treatment; these included increased stiffness and soreness, fatigue, weight gain, digestive problems, muscle spasms, cramping, and problems with sleeping. Alternative medicine has thepotential toharm aswe11astoheal. Although itisfrequently assumed that alternative treatment \"can't hurt,\" itshould not be surprising tofind that any treatment which ispower ful enough tohave aphysiological effect onthe tant toremember that even the respondents themselves168 a frequently had much trouble inassigning any changes intheir symptoms totreatment attheclinics orto other events intheir lives. These results must be regarded astentative and suggestive. Further research with greater numbers ofsubjects andgreater control ofvariables such asseverity ofsymptoms, taken, and changes169 inthe work orsocial environment are needed before the effectiveness ofalternative medicine can be established. Results ofthe few past studies ofthe effective - ness ofalternative treatment vary widely inreported results, and insome cases conflict with the results ofthis study. National Analysts (1972) found that of arthritis sufferers who obtained treatment, thepercen tage ofthose who said they benefited was ofphysician patients, astudy ofpatients identified through Workmen's Compensation etal. ofimprovement infunctional status, were aseffective asphysicians. For chiropractic patients, there was atendency for those who showed the least improvement tohave had the most therapy. Koos (1954) reports the following outcomes forpatients who switched to achiropractor after using adoctor fortheir problems: i.11ness terminated in 20cases, definite improvement in 24cases, slight improvement in 17cases, and condition remained the same in 51cases. Better results were obtained when the chiropractor only treated the problem; inthese instances the illness was terminated in91cases, definite improvement occurred in 34cases, slight-170 improvement was noted in33cases, and the condition remained the same in 12cases. Studies ofthe effectiveness ofacupuncture have concluded, ingeneral, who had failed to respond toconventional drugs found that acupuncture was effective inpain relief in 70% ofthe cases (Chen, 1973). Research onthe use ofacupuncture to relieve pain in 57patients inFlorida found acupunc ture was beneficial for the majority ofthe sample, although repeated treatments were necessary (Lee, 1973). The use ofacupuncture for chronic pain due toarthritis infifty patients inPhiladelphia pro ofthe (Matsumoto 1973). Some ofthese patients did note atemporary increase ofpain for a day following treatment. ANew York study of82 patients with pain that had failed torespond to orthodox treatment found that the results ofthe first and second acupuncture treatments were much better than the final results; 68% ofthepatients benefited iniitally, but only 4.6% were considered on discharge (Kepe etal., 1973). Shibutani (1973) followed 44acupuncture more171 than four months; 25% ofthepatients obtained ex o % cellent results, 30% obtained moderate results, 20 improved slightly, and 25% failed torespond to treatment. Treatment also led to areduction pressure and with various types ofpain problems found that 53% reported little ornopain relief after acupuncture treatment, 44% hadsignificant improvement, and 3%reported temporary aggravation ofpain (Moore, 1973). Younger patients didbetter than older ones; middle-aged sufferers obtained the 1east relief. The most extensive research onthe effectiveness ofacupuncture was byTurban Thepatients' condi tions were subjectively and objectively assessed before, during, and after treatment, and 6months after treatment completion. Only 14% ofthese patients reported noimprovement and noone reported regression orcomplications. After 6months, about two-thirds of thepatients still recorded improvements ofsome degree. There was nosignificant difference insuccess rate bysex; the least improvement was obtained inthose under age 30. When the number ofvisits was 14ormore, there was aslight reduction inthe rate ofsuccess when172 compared with fewer visits. Patients with severe pain showed almost twice asmuch complete recovery asthose with moderate pain. Thus, itseems likely that alternative treatment-- atleast chiropractic and acupuncture --canbenefit substantial numbers ofpatients insome The dynamics ofhow these improvements areeffected isanimportant question. Atheoretical consideration ofthis problem can help illuminate when and why alternative medicine might beeffective, and point the way for future research. Selye (1976) shows that many common diseases are 1argely due toerrors inthe body's adaptive response tostress, rather illnesses \"disease ofadaptation.\" Ifwetake theperspective that most problems presented for treatment byalternative medicine are diseases of adaptation inthe sense defined bySelye, then alternative treatment may beeffective through either relaxation orbyshocking the body out of amaladap tive stereotype groove. These two forms ofthera relaxation--which are effective inthe treatment ofdiseases ofadaptation are also frequently found in\"folk\" healing rituals (Klein, 1978). Whether therapeutic stress and/or173 relaxation are induced bysuch alternative treatments asacupuncture andchiropractic isstill acrucial question for future research. The pain accompanying treatment, which many respondents inthis study com plained of,may actually function ascurative stress. Other respondents commented that they found treatment quite relaxing, and became pleasantly and overwhelmingly sleepy. However, Idonot have enough systematic data tocorrelate such accompaniments oftreatment to degree ofsymptomatic improvement. These data are suggestive, but further research focusing specifically onthese issues isnecessary totest these hypotheses. Altered states of qualitatively different from anindivid ual's normal, waking consciousness --may also be an important factor inthe therapeutic efficacy of a1 ternative medicine. Throughout history, the production ofASCs has played amajor role inthe various healing arts andpractices. ...There are countless instances ofhealing practices designed totake advantage ofthesuggestibility, increased meaning, propensity for emotional catharsis, and feelings ofreju venation associated with ASCs. (Ludwig, 1969; p.19). ofand produce deep ormild ASCs, and whether such ASCs are associated with therapeutic efficacy, are intriguing and important questions for future research.174 The profound relaxation following treatment reported bysome respondents demonstrates that alternative treatment may lead tosome form ofaltered state of consciousness forcertain individuals. What type of ASC agiven stimulus produces depends largely on cultural expectations. However, inAmerican culture there are few expectations that one's state ofconscious - ness will bechanged byany form ofmedical treatment, with the exceptions ofthe ingestion ofcertain drugs and ofmassage and heat therapy. Therefore, it seems likely that there will bemajor individual differences inresponse toalternative medical tech niques depending onthepatient, thepractitioner, and the circumstances under which treatment is administered. Certain aspects ofalternative treat ment, such aspain, changes indiet, and inspite ofthe states may be acon comitant oftreatment. Alternative medicine may also derive therapeutic efficacy from itsability toinstall hope forrelief and combat feelings ofhelplessness inthe face of i11ness forcertain individuals. Engel (1968), Schmale (1972) and Frank (1973) demonstrate that giving up--falling into astate ofhoplessness and175 helplessness --contributes tothe well-known placebo effect. The above discussion suggests that alternative medical techniques may beeffective through specific psycho 1ogical mechanisms incombating diseases sample reported feeling disappointed, sad, bitter, orhope - less when their initial expectations ofrelief from alternative treatment were not met. Thus, the placebo effect can have maladaptive as we11asadaptive con sequences. Toarouse anindividual's hopes and then dash them may bequite damaging, ultimately reinforc ingrather than overcoming feelings ofhelplessness and despair. This dangerous possible consequence of alternative treatment was apparent inseveral patients inthis sample. Finally, theperception ofpain itself may be related tothe emotional state ofthe individual. Tothe extent that alternative techniques lessen apprehension, anxiety, and depression and provide opportunities foractivity and action, such treatment176 may diminish thepatient's observation ofhis pain (Frank, 1978; Eisenberg, 1977). \"One major way of helping thepatient inpain istohelp him remove the focus ofconcentration from the tooutside events. The pain isfelt tobeworse when itoccupies theentire life field. Work, occupational therapy, relating toothers; these things domuch more than just 'pass the time. 'They also diminish the pain. Both 'attention' and 'consciousness' are essential totheperception ofpain.\" (Le Shan, 1964; p.124-125). Changes inHealth Practices, Thinking, and Awareness Another important efficacy ofaltern ative techniques aretheir ability toinfluence awareness. Changes inthese areasmay have aprofound effect on aperson's subjective feelings of we11-being, health, and reaction tofuture illness. Complete data on this area for a11respondents isnot available inthis study. Only those patients who were continuing treat ment atthe Mayfield orDavis Medical Centers after the first interview were administered the full second interview, which contained most ofthe direct questions onchanges inhealth practices, thinking, and awareness. Occasionally, other respondents would spontaneously mention such changes during thefirst interview.177 These data are suggestive agegroups mentioned that theclinics reinforced what they already knew, and that they found this helpful. I'd already gotten that advice . . . .it helped mekeep aware it's necessary todoit(diet and exercise). It's easy toget lax and think itdoesn't matter very much. Itreally helps togetitreinforced from avariety ofsources. (Wayne Johnson, age 57). Such comments point tothe idea that health education is acontinous rather than aonce-and-for-all process, and that alternative medicine may behelpful inrein forcing beneficial preventive health practices. The majority ofpatients received advice ondiet ornutri tion atMayfield and Davis Medical Centers, and sub stantial numbers received advice onexercise, posture, orother health practices. The accuracy ofthis advice inmedical terms and its long-term effect onpatients' health practices could not beimmediately ascertained; this isanimportant field for future research. Respondents inthe midlife group were several times more likely than older respondents tosay that their health practices had changed, the way they thought about health and disease had changed, and that they had learned anything about health and disease as a result oftreatment atthe Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers. Inthis were far more inlifestyle and thinking. This isone area inwhich midlife respondents were more willing toinnovate. Several midlife respondents also reported acquiring more positive, hopeful attitudes toward their own bodies ormedical problems as aresult oftreatment atthe Mayfield about myhealth, believing I'm ahealthy person instead of asick person. Ihave faith inthe vehicle. [Dr. Blake )said Iwas treating my body as avestigial organ. Stopped smoking may have been indirectly connected to[Mayfield); Iwas cleaning up myact. (Doris Short, age 35). Haefner and Kirscht (1970) point out that changing health beliefs does not necessarily lead toconcomi tant changes inhealth behaviors, especially long-es tablished behaviors that simultaneously satisfy a variety ofmotives that may not behealth-related. Suchman (1967) describes alarge number ofpersonal readiness, social control, and situational factors which influence the acceptance orrejection ofpreven tive health measures. Thus, theability ofalterna tive the promotion ofpreventive measures is 1imited by alarge number changes in 1ifestyle.179 effectiveness ofbiofeedback, orfor that matter, any behavioral orbiological treatment program involving self-control (for example, taking drugs), ultimately depends on thepatient's motivation andability differenee between behavioral procedures for helping patients tohelp themselves, asopposed todeveloping educational and social programs for leadingpatients tomake effective, long-term use of the new behavioral technology. (Schwartz, 1979; p.374). Thus, assessing theeffectiveness ofalternative techniques is acomplex task. effectiveness is not anabsolute that can physioloigcal tests orpermanent. Apatient may feel sub jectively better without any accompanying changes in organic pathology. Alternative techniques influence health both directly --through physiological, psycho logical, and sociocultural processes --andindirectly -- through changes inhealth beliefs, practices, and awareness. Much further research isneeded toclarify the efficacy ofalternative techniques fordifferent types ofpatients with diverse problems and in widely varying circumstances. The factors influencing the outcome ofalternative treatment interact in a complex and intriguing fashion.180 Chapter 5 Satisfaction with Alternative Medicine Overa 11Satisfaction Satisfaction with a1ternative medicine isanother extremely complex variable which isdifficult to measure. Patients express differential satisfaction with medical treatments received, thepractitioners they saw, and other aspects ofcontact with Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers. Satisfaction was influenced by acomplex interaction ofperceived physiological, cognitive and affective, and material factors. Iwill report the actual level ofsatisfaction with the clinics under study described byrespondents, and begin toexamine the dynamics ofthis judgment. Respondents were dichotomized into those who expressed generally high overall satisfaction with Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers and those who expressed generally lowsatisfaction orindifference. This was determined byresponse tothe question \"How satisfied you with the (Mayfield orDavis) Medical Center sofar?\" onthefirst interview (ifpatient was interviewed only once) orthe question, are you with the (Mayfield orDavis)181 Medical Center?\" onthe second interview (ifpatient was interviewed twice). Respondents were almost equally divided onthis measure ;22expressed generally positive feelings and 23vented gnerally negative feelings toward theclinics. This measure corresponded closely toother measures ofgeneral satisfaction. Only two ofthose inthe high satisfaction group said they would not recommend the Mayfield orDavis Medi cal Centers to afriend orrelative, while only three inthe lowsatisfaction group said they would. Just one person inthe high satisfaction group would not return tothe Mayfield orDavis Medical Centers, while just three patients inthe lowsatisfaction group would consider returning. The older group tended tobe more satisfied; 6.1% ofthis group were inthe high satisfaction category, while only 36% ofthemidlife group were inthis category. Sex was not related to overal 1satisfaction. Degree ofsymptomatic improvement resulting from treatment atthe Mayfield orDavis Medical Centers was closely related tooverall satisfaction with the clinics. Excluding the two people who did not report any symptoms, two-thirds ofthose inthe high satis faction group obtained moderate orhigh improvement in symptoms, while only about 14% ofthose inthe low satisfaction group experienced this degree ofrelief.182 Tostate these results inother words, those who obtained significant symptomatic improvement were almost uniformly satisfied with theclinics, but those who obtained noimprovement were not uniformly dis - satisfied with the clinics --factors other than symptomatic relief contributed tofeelings ofsatis faction. Considering the fact that the desire for effective treatment was the main factor motivating respondents toseek alternative treatment, itis hardly surprising that the degree ofsymptomatic improvement issohighly correlated with who finding who were dissatisfied with theclinics despite ahigh degree ofsymptomatic improvement and those who were satis fied with theclinics despite alow degree ofsympto matic relief. A11 three respondents inthe former group were patients ofDr. Blake, thechiro practor. One ofthese poeple left theclinics, and soshe could nolonger Obtain effective treatment there. The other two were dissatisfied with treatment itself: one because she felt treatment was being unnecessarily andexpensively183 prolonged and the other because oflack ofrelief for one problem brought for treatment and lack of asatis factory relationship with thepractitioner. A11 of the seven people inthe group comprised ofthose who were satisfied with theclinics despite lack ofsym tomatic improvement were acupuncture patients. Five were inthe older sample and two were inthemidlife sample. These patients all expressed thoughts along the line that the acupuncture treatments they received were satisfactory, but that the problems they had were not amenable toacupuncture treatment orwould require more treatments than they felt they could afford at the moment. The acupuncturist had done the best he could; something inthem prevented the treatment from being effective. This accords with the findings of Woolley etal. (1978) that patients expressed satis faction with care when medical outcome was poor ifthey fe1tthe physician treating them had expended effort and done his best. These exceptions, then, ultimately reinforce the general rule that overall satisfaction with alternative care ismost closely related to perceived physiological factors, especially effective - ness ofcare. About half ofthose inthe lowsatisfaction group explicitly stated their dissatisfaction was with the184 Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers themselves, not alternative medicine per se. These people were still generally positive toalternative medicine and felt another practitioner ortreatment site might bemore beneficial andsatisfactory than these clinics had proven tobe. Thus, while satisfaction with theclinics implied satisfaction with alternative medicine, the reverse isnot true. Dissatisfaction with these clinics did not necessarily eliminate the hope that alternative medicine might beofvalue tothepatient. Perceived cognitive andaffective factors and material variables had weaker corre 1ation with overal 1satisfaction with categories ofvariables isdifficult todetermine from these data. Itispossible that treatment was less physiologically effective forpatients who were dissatisfied onother grounds. Patients who did not obtain relief may have been more 1ikely tofind fault with theclinics, while those who were helped may have been more to1erant inoverlooking the flaws oftheclinics. Ormaterial and cognitive andaffec tive variables may have made contributions tooverall satisfaction. Itislikely that, infact, a11 three ofthe above processes occurred and reflected obtained.18.5 For example, thought atthe Mayfield Medical Centers was overpriced. Forty-five percent ofthose inthe high satisfaction group and sixty-one percent ofthose inthe lowsatisfaction group mentioned not understanding some portion ofthealternative treatment they received and not having their questions about this answered. Ofthose who were interviewed a second time and directly questioned about amount of personal attention received attheclinics, 41.7% of those inthe high satisfaction and 28.6% ofthose in the lowsatisfaction group felt they had received any notable amount ofpersonal attention attheclinics. The remainder said the amount ofpersonal attention paid tothem was minimal. Thus, itwas possible tofee 1theclinics were overpriced, treatment was unintelligible, orthat one was not receiving any personal attention andstill be generally satisfied with theclinics ifeffective relief was obtained there. Furthermore, itisapparent that alternative isnot necessarily orautomatically superior toorthodox medicine onmaterial orcognitive andaffective grounds. Ofthose who were interviewed a second time and asked tocompare their relationship with thepractitioner atMayfield orDavis Medical Centers with their relationship tothelast doctor they went to,approxi186 mately one-third said their relationship tothe doctor was better ormore personal, one -third said their relationship tothealternative practitioner wasbetter ormore personal, and one -third said the tworelation ships were about the same. Such problems ashigh costs, failure toanswer questions, and feelings of personal neglect onthe part ofpatients are endemic toboth orthodox and alternative medicine inthe United States today. These data support the hypothesis that the perceived severity ofthese problems forindi vidual patients undergoing any form oftreatment is related tothe amount ofsymptomatic amelioration felt toresult from treatment. Satisfaction with Specifics Patients were differentially satisfied with the various aspects oftheir contact with Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers. Overall 1eve 1ofsatisfaction ordissatisfaction did not imply apatient judged the particulars oftreatment, practitioners, and other facets oftheclinics in aparallel manner. All respondents mentioned specific aspects oftheir experience attheclinics which they especially liked ordisliked. AsFreidson (1961) points out, just because apatient expresses apractical satisfaction with the present does not mean hedoes not have some unrealized ideals inmind.187 Satisfaction with thepractitioner orpractitioners who provided treatment atthe Mayfield orDavis Medical dimensions: implications; personality; qualifications, knowl edge, andskill; style oftreatment; and relationship thepatient. Different patients emphasized one oranother ofthese dimensions asmost important in their satisfaction with thepractitioner. This is one domain where cognitive and affective considerations equalled orsurpassed perceived physiogical considerations indetermining satisfaction; however, the two sets of variables very much interacted. Judgment of aparticular practitioner along any ofthese measures was strikingly idiosyncratic. The same practitioner would behighly praised onone dimension byone respondent and scathing ly condemned byanother for the same thing. Itwas indeed apparent that noonepractitioner could please a11 ofthe people a11ofthe time. For example, many patients interpreted Dr. Blake's frequent reassurances ofhis ability tocure them asirresponsible glibness, while others commended this practice asgiving them hope. Several respondents felt their relationship with thepractitioner was ofnoparticular importance :they did not want tobein amedical setting, got their social support inother contexts, and wanted only to18.8 beproperly and quickly treated sothey could leave. These patients disliked achatty practitioner who prolonged treatment. Other patients felt slighted whenever thepractitioner seemed unwilling tospend amaximal amount oftime with them and inquire on every aspect oftheir lives. However, even inthese cases, thepatient was not always seeking support or attention per se; many respondents expressed the opinion that anuninterested practitioner could not provide proper treatment. Judgments ofthepracti - tioner's personality were important contributors to satisfaction with thepractitioner. Impressions of personality were usually vague feelings that theprac titioner was nice ordisagreeable. Few respondents gave detailed comments onthepersonality oftheprac titioner they had contact with ,nor did they describe much concrete basis for the impressions they had formed. Contrary tothe frequent contention inthelitera - ture that patients donot feel tojudge the personnel, therespon dents inthis sample evidenced nohesitation injudging practitioners along these lines. Even when apatient first received atreatment hehad never had orchiropractic animpression ofwhether thepractitioner seemed to hewas doing and did the appropriate thing.189 Ifthepatient had received such atype oftreatment before, comparisons would frequently bemade tothe qualifications ofpast practitioners. The hypothesis that patients feel unable tojudge medical personnel along technical lines, and sobase satisfaction only oncognitive and emotional criteria, received no support inthis study. Infact, theoffering of sympathy, advice, reassurance, orother such aspects of\"care for i11ness\" bywhat was felt tobeanun qualified practitioner was amajor contributor to dissatisfaction. Many ofDr. Blake's patients, es pecially, resented his attempts tocare fortheir emotional needs because they felt hewas unqualified inthis area. He[Dr. Blake Hewould lecture instead ofget ting adialogue going. (Doris Short, age 35). These findings suggest that any simple attempt todeal with patient dissatisfaction with orthodox medicine byhaving doctors suddenly start plunging into their patients' personal lives ismore likely toincrease than decrease dissatisfaction with orthodox medicine. Satisfaction with the medical treatments received atMayfield orDavis Medical Centers rested primarily onperceived physiological criteria. The most important190 ofthese were whether the treatment was felt tobe effective, thorough, appropriate, andpainful or pleasant. Satisfaction with medical treatments was often closely related tosatisfaction with the practitioner. For example, itwas felt that aninter ested practitioner would furnish thorough treatment, while aninattentive practitioner would provide rushed treatment. Iftreatment waspainful, respondents often felt thepractitioner was doing something wrong. Respondents did not seem toconsider other apsects ofclinic contact very important unless these experi ences contributed toinconvenience orhigh costs or affected treatment itself. Again, judgments ofthe clinics were quite idiosyncratic. Some respondents were very satisfied with thephysical setting and general ambience ofthe Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers, while other respondents made strongly unfavorable comments along these lines. Several patients were unhappy with the location ofthe Davis Medical Center, which they perceived asdangerous or undesirable. Patients ranged from highly satisfied to highly dissatisfied with thenonmedical staff ofthe clinics. While many respondents felt theclinics were overpriced, others mentioned that the cost was reasonable oreven cheap. A1arge number onthem: long waiting times, mis- booked appointments, seeing the wrong practitioner, etc. However, afew respondents mentioned that they were quite satisfied because they did not have towait when they had anappointment. The literature onsatisfaction with a1ternative medicine isquite sparse, soitisdifficult tomake meaningful comparisons ofthese results and previous findings. Elder and Acheson (1970) report that among arthritis sufferers who obtained chiropractic treatment, 85.7% ofthose inthe 1ower classes and 46.2% ofthose inthe higher classes were satisfied. Kane etal. (1974) found that those treated bychiropractors were assatisfied asthose treated byphysicians for back and spinal problems. Chiropractic patients inthat study were more satisfied than physician patients in terms ofevaluating thepractitioners' abilities to make thepatient feel welcome and toexplain the problem and treatment. Satisfaction with the Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers was thus afluid and complex variable. When patients were interviewed twice, their judgments frequently changed over time. Much further research isneeded toclarify thespecific dynamics ofthe interaction ofvarious factors indetermining both overall satisfaction with alternative medical treat ment andsatisfaction with specifics.192 Chapter 6 Case Studies Aconside ration of asmall number ofspecific cases will illustrate theprinciples relating to the questions ofmedical choice, effectiveness, and satisfaction discussed above. The complex interaction ofvariables and dynamic feedback loops are best clarified bythe examination ofcase studies. Iwill discuss thehighlights ofeight cases, selected these individuals inpart fortheir diversity and typicality of anumber ofcases not discussed. A11 the questions ideas discussed inthe previous chapters come to- gether inthe individual cases, where responses to changing events may beobserved over time. David Gold David Gold was a37-year-old unemployed program administrator with twomaster's degrees --one inspecial education and one inyoga psychology. His wife of nine years was apsychotherapist; they had no children. Their annual family income was over $25,000 ayear.193 David rated his health asvery good and tended to minimize his previous and present health problems. Hewent toMayfield Medical Center for the treatment oftwo sets inhis shoulder from tendonit isand digestive his \"traditional doctors\" was fairly low. Hesaw physicians as\"good mechanics\" who overemphasized undesirable drug therapy, took themselves too serious ly, were not thorough, and were difficult toget information from. Although he thought some doctors were better than others and could beofhelp inmany instances, his overal 1attitude toward the medical profession was one ofcondemnation. Even during Watergate Ifelt doctors were the least trustworthy group insociety. For the limits oftheir knowledge, they're the most overinflated group insociety. know.\" Iwant tohear Some balance and Iwant to know what the limits are .I'm very wary. The symptoms get attacked ;it's very aggressive. Your system gets used tothis and cuts offits own healing process. David and his wife had been vegetarians for some time. Hepaid close attention tohis diet and empha sized the role ofproper nutrition inthe ofhealth. Healso regularly and health measures. Heattributed his tendonitis and digestive problems in194 large part tostress, and had deliberately taken off from working for ayear \"to get over the need to perform.\" Heinsisted hewashealthier andfelt better after hestopped eating meat, although his digestive problems began atthis point and heacknowledged there could be aconnection inthat nutrients inhis diet. David's tendon itishad been previously aided by surgery and his digestive problems byvitamin Band enzymes, but now these complaints had returned and he felt the need for treatment. Traditional doctors offered him nothing but medication, which hewas very reluctant totake. Atthe same time, hecharacterized himself aswary ofalternative practitioners, who might present the same problems astraditional doctors. He found out about the Mayfield Medical Center from the Yellow Pages. Iwent just totry them and see what they had tooffer. Dr. Blake treated David with chiropractic, acunpuncture, andnutritional counseling. From the beginning, David expressed extreme ambivalence toward theclinic, alternating praise inone sentence with condemnation inthe next. I'm not sure he[Dr. Blake )knows more nutri tion than Ido. Hethrew out terms about meridians that were gobbley gook, but he195 said things that made sense. His orientation was that a11myproblems were connected and because energy was blocked there were problems in myweakest spot. Hegave mesome enzymes and only temproary. Idefinitely felt better. Ialso feel clearer communication between mind and body. I'm not sure it's because ofsuggestion oritisbetter. [Dr. Blake] emphasizes the need to clear the body. Ofcourse, hewears his white coat.

David continued inthis wave ring fashion through a11 aspects ofclinic contact. Atthe time ofthe second interview, David had made anumber ofadditional visits tothe Mayfield Medical Center and had decided toterminate treatment. His symptoms had very much improved. The constant ache inhis arm had disappeared andits range ofmotion was much greater. His digestive problems had also been markedly ame 1iorated. Hefelt his arm would improve more with further treatment, \"but Icouldn't afford togountil perfection.\" Dr. Blake the digestive prob 1ems.

David's final evaluation was one ofhigh satis - faction with Dr. Blake and his medical treatments, and very 1owsatisfaction with well illustrates how complex anunderstanding ofmedical choice, effectiveness, and satisfaction must beinthe face ofsuch strong and197 pervasive ambivalence. The great relief ofsymptoms obtained inthis case demonstrates thepotential effectiveness Gabrie 11e Mi11et Gabrielle Millet was a34-year-old woman who had recently arrived from France. She had been married five years and had a4-year-old son. Her master's degree was inbiology and psychophysiology; she was currently working as ateacher at apre-school, and said she enjoyed her job. Gabrielle sawherself ashaving asevere health problem with her nerves. This condition ran inher family; her mother and older sister had been sotroubled. Her symptoms were both caused byand led toemotional and social problems. Each time there is alittle bit ofpressure in mylife --itcan come from anything, my family, myjob--mynerves react very strongly, out ofproportion, so Iwill getlittle spots ofpain all over. not young any more.It's hard tofeel your body isbetween you and what you want todo. Itwas hard for metoaccept and harder for myhusband to accept it. Gabrielle's satisfaction with specific instances oforthodox medical care depended very much onwhether198 the diagnosis made and treatment prescribed accorded with her own ideas. She was convinced her problem was physical, and was very upset bydoctors who said itwas solely mental orthat there was nothing really wrong with her. She also sawherself asextremely sensitive todrugs, and resisted any treatment that involved medication. She had seen four physicians for her condition, andmentioned the good and bad points ofeach one. Noone had helped her. Ingen eral shedistrusted doctors and preferred torely on the advice ofher sister orother o1.der women. She emphasized the importance ofmaintaining harmony with nature. Ifpeople could beintune with an\"ancient knowledge ofmedicine\" they could instantly heal themselves of a11problems. Mental condition was key inthe maintenance a11the time. Getting into acontradiction ofyour heart and your head can make you sick --itcan 1ead tocancer. Mind first --good health comes from agood mind. Gabrie 11easserted that Dr. Blake atMayfield Medical Center was thefirst person who was able to help her. She had heard about him from afriend, and decided togive him atrial. Ihad nochoice. I'dtried everything So Idecided tomake another try and see what happens.199 Dr. Blake surprised her byworking onher physically. Atfirst she seemed abit confused about the kind of treatment she received and ca.11ed it\"biofeedback.\" When Idefined biofeedback for her and she described the treatment, sheclarified the fact that Dr. Blake had been using chiropractic and acupressure. She also said heused \"love\" as atreatment. Lots oflove from him, friendship, under standing. Heworks on measmuch mentally asphysically. It's someone who understands mysuffering and misery. She lauded Dr. Blake highly onthe entire first inter view and said shefelt much better both physically and mentally. His diagnosis ofher condition was that her energy was \"a11bottled up.\" Itrusted him because his diagnosis con firmed what Iknew. - Gabrie 11e stated she wished toreturn tothe clinic for further treatment, but could not afford todoso for amonth ortwo. Atthe time ofthe second interview, which was five months later, Gabrielle's opinion ofDr. Blake had undergone some strong changes. She had notre turned tohim for treatment, but had found another chiropractic clinic with which she was far more satisfied. She admitted problems other than money had prevented her from returning toMayfield Medical Center for treatment. She out 1ined the 1imitations200 ofDr. Blake asshe was nowwilling todiscuss them. Despite the fact that her English was excellent, she said alanguage barrier existed between them. There were other problems. His diagnosis was immature tome. Like he was always telling me\"don't think about the symptoms.\" But inorder tocooperate with your doctor you have tounderstand what he's doing and hewon't explain tomebecause Idon't exactly what never to1d ofenergy. Ifelt hewas working on metoo strong. I got spasms in mymuscles and nerves at night. What he to1d meabout that did not make me . . tohelp me, but inthe end he wasn't what Iwas looking for. Gabrielle highly lauded the chiropractic clinic she now attended. The diagnosis she had received there-- hormonal insufficiency and atailbone at abad angle toher spine --pleased her immensely, and shefelt sure they could get rid ofher symptoms for her. Gabrielle's case illustrates the need forlongi tudinal studies indetermining the dynamics ofmedical choice and satisfaction. From the first interview alone, itwould appear that cognitive and emotional factors could explain most ofher actions and feelings. However, the second interview clarifies the fact that these cognitive and emotional variables are highly fluid, and closely linked toperceived physiological201 aspects ofcare. Despite the fact that Dr. Blake was someone who shefelt understood her suffering and misery, hewas not thepractitioner Gabrielle was looking for. Donna File 1ds Donna Fields was a36-year-old woman with amas ter's degree incounseling who worked as aprogram coordinator for senior supportive services. She was single, and reported anincome of$15,000 to$20,000 ayear. She rated her health, about often, asfair. Shelisted alarge number ofhealth problems which she claimed tohave had inthe past and continuing tothepresent: lower back problems, stress fatigue problems, undiagnosed kidney problems, vaginal infections, stomach problems, poor sleep, chronic bronchitis, and overweight. Her insurance was with a 1arge prepaid medical program which she disliked intensely. They compartmentalize your body. You forstarters because it's sohard toget aregular doctor. know anything about health. They're good parts replacers. They're contributing tothedeterioration ofour health and drug abuse. Their orientation doesn't work. They don't relate toyou as aperson. Theydon't deal with nutrition orstress as factors ....[The program] would befineifyou really let your body goand needed surgery. Traditional medicine doesn't a11ow for preventive anything --they don't have the concepts.202 Although shestressed the concept ofprevention, Donna admitted todoing nothing routinely tomaintain her own health. Donna had been going tochiropractors regularly foryears, and had recently moved tothis metropoli tan area from asmaller town about eighty miles away. There she had achiropractor who also used acupressure, and was quite pleased tohear ofDr. Blake because he also combined these two techniques. The acupressure and chiropractic are realintegrated. For mechiropractic alone, without acupressure orShiatsu, doesn'tlast aslong. She went tothe Davis Medical Center because they offered what she wanted. Donna became very involved with Dr. Blake's work and was seeing him for treatment atleast twice aweek. She traded services inhelping him with hispatients for treatment. Atthe time of the first interview she said she felt a1otbetter. Treatments were extremely painful forher, though ;she thought this was normal \"when there's something wrong with you.\" She cried and screamed during treatment. Atthe time ofthe second interview, Dr. Blake hadjust left theclinics toset uphis ownprivate practice, and Donna had followed him. She felt better, butstill had the problems she came with because \"I still have todo mypart and Ihaven't been doing it.\"203 She especially had to 10seweight and exercise. Treatment was immediate 1ybut only temporarily effec tive inthe face ofher own inaction. She also blamed this therapy for some negative changes inher 1ife. Itcost me Iwas being more open with myfeelings and had run-ins with people atwork. She was also depressed ather own failure todowhat she saw asher part incuring. She resented the long waits she had tosee the doctor atDavis, and characterized the cost there astoo high. Donna's case exemplifies how wide the gap can bebetween belief andpractice, especially inthe area ofpreventive medicine. Her case also illustrates how subtle and complex the effects ofalternative treatment may be. Although Donna's symptoms improved, her sense ofdesperation and unhappiness was sharpened byher inability orunwillingness to exercise inorder own health, asDr. B1ake had advised her todo. The complexity ofthe dynamics ofchoice, satisfaction, and effectiveness in a1ternative medicine isindeed visible here.204 SCOtt Turner Scott Turner was a37-year-old man who was highly dissatisfied with his current life. Isee the need for some kind ofstrategy in mylife. Ifeel like I'mgetting old and I'm embarrassed tote11people I'm five years ofcollege, hehad never gotten adegree, and was currently working as ares taurant porter. Hewas divorced for 12years. Scott characterized his health asvery good. His main current health problem was chronic back pain, which hehad experienced for about eight years and which had only recently been medically treated. Ididn't goto adoctor because Ithoughtitwas tension and there was nothing a doctor could dobut give mepain pills, which Iwasn't into. Scott finally went to alarge teaching hospital for treatment. Hefirst saw anosteopath, who recommended exercise and physical therapy. The physical therapist said the exercises the doctor gave him would be harmful; she gave him amass age that relieved his pain greatly. Because ofher efficacy but the doctor's higher training, hefelt anacute conflict over the fact these twopractitioners disagreed, and the end result for him was agreater distrust oforthodox medicine.205 Idon't really fee 1good about doctors at a11. They're okay for small straightforward things like getting rid ofwarts, and Ijudge each doctor asanindividual onthat They can todothat myself. Scott traced his disi 11usionment with doctors to gradual changes beginning inhis 20s. Istarted torealize that doctors weren't gods. They didn't always know what was wrong orwhat todo. Sometimes they screw you upmore or 1ess badly. They hustle you right through. Scott emphasized aperson's ownability tomaintain perfect health, especially byprotection from tension and stress. Scott ended upatthe Davis Medical Center be- cause hehad made uphis mind totry acupuncture, and was bythereferral number discussed above. Hewas misbooked tosee Dr. Blake, the chiropractor. Atfirst Scott thought Dr. Blake could help him and said nothing about his preference for acupuncture. When Dr. Blake's first treatment had noresults, Scott complained and was given afree acupuncture treatment. When this also failed to relieve his pain, hesought one treatment from an acupuncturist outside ofDavis. His pain continued; hewas discouraged from further treatment bytheinabil ofalternative medicine toprovide immediate relief.206 Ihad gotten acupuncture acouple years ago for abad headache that wouldn't go away, and ithad worked immediately so I had faith inacupuncture. Iexpected immediate results this time too. Hewas willing toconcede that acupuncture might take several treatments tohelp forthis problem, and was conside ring thepossibility ofseeking more it. istypical ofthose went toMayfield orDavis Medical Centers forrelief of awell-defined symptom, and were disappointed and failed toreturn totheclinic when relief was not immediately forthcoming. Scott's unrealistic expectations oforthodox medicine for infallible treatment had been dashed much earlier, and had 1ed tobitter disi 11usionment. Now these same expectations seemed tohave been transferred to a1ternative medicine. Annette Wils on Annette Wilson was a66-year-old black woman who looked younger than her years. She had two years of college and had worked onand off for many years as anentertainer: asinger, paino player, and comedian. She was actively trying toget back into show business. She was single and had one adult daughter.207 Annette, who rated her health asvery good, characterized herself as abasically optimistic person. Her main health concern was anuncontrolled, spasmodic movement inher head and neck. During the ten years she had this problem ithad been repeatedly treated bydoctors without success, and she was told itwas incurable. This she refused to be1ieve. I'm sure I'll be 100% okay. I'm very meta physical --mind over matter, not dwelling on negative things. Wecreate the things in our lives intentionally. Weare creators. I'm glad Ifeel this way, because Iwas told there was nocure for what was wrong with Idon't believe itand I'm going toperiods ofsevere depression, and periodically consulted apsychologist orpsychiatrist when she felt she could nolonger handle her problems alone. Annette had agenerally high opinion ofmost physicians she had contact with ,and was quite satisfied with her present doctors: ageneral practitioner, a neurologist, and aneye doctor. However, none ofthem could cure her problem; the medication the neurologist gave her caused her tolose all muscle tone inher neck sothat her head drooped onto her chest until she stopped taking it. She took medication tokeep her blood pressure under control, but was generally wary oftheeffects ofdrugs. Annette selected the Davis Medical Center from208 anadvertisement inthe telepone book; the fact that she could use her insurance there was amajor factor influencing her choice. During the long course of acupuncture treatment she underwent, her condition periodically got better and then worse. Annette never gave uphope that acupuncture would result in acure, and was able torationalize failure asindicat ing ultimate success. Yesterday Ihad acupuncture and today I'm very shaky. That doesn't bother mebecause heshook up afew things and now they have tosettle down, like abedspring shaken up. She was very much encouraged bythe acupuncturist's assurance that hecould help her. Atthe time ofthe second interview, about four months from thefirst, Annette's problem persisted and she had temporarily discontinued acupuncture treatment. Her basic attitude was still that acu puncture could provide acure, but she needed to arest from it. She complained ofsevere difficulty insatisfactorily communicating with theOriental acupuncturist. One reason she had decided toterminate treatment was the pain involved inacupuncture and the apprehensiveness this created for her. She hypothesized that one reason acupuncture was not more effective for her was because when thepractitioner wanted torun electric current through the needles itwas sopainful209 that she had him turn the current all the way down until she could not feel it. She regarded the current gap inher treatment positively, and her optimism and good spirits continued unabated. Annette's case vividly illustrates that actual change inphysical symptoms isonly one contributor toperceived effectiveness oftreatment. can overrride months ofcontrary ob servation. Aperson can interpret his physical condition in awide variety ofways. This isnot a case ofalternative medicine providing hope, but of apositive-spirited person focusing her hope on alternative medicine and maintaining anoptimistic stance inthe face of aseemingly incurable problem. Irene Ne1son Irene Nelson was a72-year-old retired secretary, married but with nochildren. She had experienced numerous health problems --including gall bladder surgery, aninactive thyroid, and severe leg pain --for which she felt responsible. With what I've been through the last ten years --I've brought itonmyself. . . .It seems like a11I've done the 1ast few years isrecuperate from something. The main complain which worried her was the severe leg pain which greatly limited heractitivity; she210 attributed this problem toscar tissue onthe nerves caused bytoo much strenuous work inher garden when she was younger. Irene had exhausted orthodox medicine's options fortreating chronic pain. Aside from such usual measures aspain pills, she had been operated ontwice with what were still experimental procedures. They implanted electrodes in mybrain first. Itried itout for two weeks and they didn't work. Inearly died inthe operation --it was seven hours and mykidneys failed. They implanted electrodes right on myspine between myshoulder blades and itstill doesn't help. Her negative experiences with orthodox medicine did not end with the dangerous andineffective operations. Itake all these pain pills and they've given memorphine inthehospital. Ihad to goondrug withdrawal ;itwas the most horrible experience. But then Iwas inthehospital again and they gave memorphine again soitwas a11wasted. Despite a11this, Irene still was largely positive toward orthodox medicine and spoke highly ofmany of the doctors who treated her. Shestill thought new research developments could provide her with some relief, although she was not very hopeful inthis regard. Iwished Icould back uptobefore when we were just talking about theelectrode operation. Iwouldn't have done itata11. But itdid reveal wondered ifmaybe itwouldn't the 1eg pain. Ifthey would just come upwith something now that did help,I'd beperfectly happy. Afriend suggested toIrene that she try \"the holistic doctors\" for her pain, and Irene looked up the Mayfield Medical Clinic through atelephone book advertisement. Itwas like grasping at astraw. Iwas ready totry anything that might help. She was assigned tosee Dr. Blake, who immediately suggested she sue the doctors who did the electrode therapy. This angered Irene --shefelt she had agreed tothe operation and that the docotrs had done their best. The chiropractic and acupressure treatments were painful toher and did not help her problem. She did not understand the rationale ofthese manipulations. She then asked tosee the acupuncturist; this treatment was less painful, but she was afraid the needles were inadequate lysterilized and was not sure the acupunc turist was treating hercorrectly. She finally decided toterminate treatment when the clinics tried tocollect cash from her inaddition towhat Medicare was paying them. Irene stated she would never again try any kind ofalternative medicine, except at a place personally recommended bysomeone who had been helped there. Shestill regularly drank amixture that Dr. B1ake had prescribed for her, although she modified this recipe tosuit her own needs andbeliefs.212 Istill drink the drink hegave metwice aday. Igot most ingredients in a health food store. Itseems like afarily complete food. Idon't bother about afertile egg yolk. Idon't know what differenceitwould make ;myhusband pregnant. why Ionly use half abanana instead of awhole banana, too. I know the yeast isgood. Idon't know what the flax seed isfor, except in mind-set will beinterpreted largely inthe light ofprior experience andbelief systems. Even if treatment isnot effective inrelieving symptoms, contact with alternative medicine may spark some positive, ifminor change for thepatient, such as providing anew item for atired menu. Irene was seeking simple symptomatic relief atMayfield Medical Center, and her failure toobtain this 1eft her even 1ess hopeful than before. Her decision toterminate alternative treatment emerged from acomplex mix of perceived physiological, cognitive and emotional, and material factors.213 Joseph Cantor Joseph Cantor was a72-year-old immigrant from Czechoslovakia, where hehad been in aconcentration camp inWorld War II. Heand his wife had one adult daughter. Hehad aneighth-grade education and had worked inthis country as aself-employed wholesale jobber; hedescribed himself asa\"workaholic.\" Joseph had Hodgkin's Disease three years ago, but appeared tohave been cured. His main current health concern was severe back pain, which he attributed toarthritis. Hehad traveled widely, trying agreat variety oforthodox and alternative treatments for his suffering. These included DMSO, faith healing, European spas, chiropractic, andacu puncture. Inthe beginning this quest forrelief was abitter experience. Iwent toBoston for the healer who lays on hands tocure. with mydaughter; it was bullshit. Ianswered an paper, this black guy, adirty hecouldn't. Now Idon't inthese - ments. It's terrible -how they kinds ofstories when they're not true. Iwas sodisappointed Icried like a kid. When you're inpain you believe in anybody totake the pain away. Joseph was atthis point generally satisfied with the medical treatments hehad received, and was quite conscious ofthe nature ofhis never-ending search for relief.214 They dothe best they can, only nobody can help me. Whether they treat mewell orbad, the pain stays .. . . You have tobelieveit's going togetbetter tomorrow. What's the choice? You believe that orthe opposite, and the opposite isn't healthy.It's really just lying toyourself, but you have todoit;it's necessary. I've tried everything and nothing has helped, but I'mstill looking totry new things. Who knows what might help ? The one form oftreatment which Joseph resisted trying was medication; his fear ofdrugs was so strong that hewould rather take nomedication and suffer than take pills toobtain relief. Mydoctor gave methese pain pills three years ago and told metotake one every four hours. If Ihad taken them 1ike that for the last three years how many pi11s would that be7 Iwouldn't even --at least it's something. Joseph went tothe Mayfield Medical Center for acupuncture. Henoticed their sign ashepassed onthestreet, and decided totry theclinic ofits convenience. Hewas high 1ysatisfied with the treatments hereceived there and characterized the acupuncturist asanexcellent doctor. Treatment would provide relief for afew hours, but then the pain returned. The acupuncture also tired him out. Joseph finally terminated treatment, rather philosophically accepting the 1ack ofpermanent results. Hehad plans shows aperson disillusionment despite repeated disappointment. Hope was anecessary part ofhis life. Healso demon strates how extreme fear can be-- despite his desperation for acure, herefused totake that incases like bevaluable. Vivian Ha11 Vivian Hall was a76-year-old retired hairdresser who was divorced and had nochildren. She had two artificial hips; these operations were performed after she broke her hips and they failed toheal properly. Her attitude toorthodox medicine was one ofmild satisfaction coupled with askepticism of theability ofmost physicians, necessitating acareful choosing ofdoctors. Her major current health concern was a pain inher neck which became great enough tolimit her activity. Around Thanksgiving Istarted having this pain inmyneck, and Iknew if Iwent ofthese regular So I decided togoto achiropractor. Vivien had been tochiropractors many times before. Although they never did much forher, she). -- p216 downplayed this bysaying there had never been much wrong with her. Her attitude toalternative medicine was one ofcuriosity, very lowexpectations, and even amild sense ofhumor. She had alarge stack of books onsuch subjects asnutrition, acupressure, and psychic healing. I'm always reading things, and most ofthemaren't any good. Onaccount of mymother's The last book Isent for was onthe magic food that cures everything -- and itturned out tobegarlic. Although Mayfield Medical Center was only afew blocks from where she lived, Vivian checked Dr. Blake's qualifications with the local association of chiropractors before she went there. She warned Dr. Blake not touse strong chiropractic manipulations be- cause ofher weak bones, soheused only acupressure onher. The treatments made her sorelaxed that she felt the need togotobed after receiving them. She spoke highly ofDr. Blake's skill, and did not feel anydissatisfaction because ofthe lack of aclose personal relationship with him. Atthe time ofthe second interview, Vivian stated that thepain inher neck was completely gone. When treatment for this problem proved soeffective, Dr. Blake began work on trying toimprove her general energy level. Onthis task hewas not proving successful, and when hemoved217 into private practice inanoffice that wasinconvenient for her, Vivian decided toterminate treatment. Despite her cure, Vivian did not enthuse over chiropractic ;she saw astrict division of 1abor between orthodox and alternative medicine. What Iwent there [toMayfield] for was taken care of. Iwassatisfied. Ifithappens again, I'll goback. Idon't think they can take care ofeverything. They can't check your vital functions oranything --heart, blood pressure, blood count. Ifyou go toan MDthey always put you through a11thosetests, but they don't dothe other things, like what thechiropractor does --adjusting your back. Vivian's case demonstrates that alternative medicine can bequite effective inrelieving medical problems for theelderly. Vivian was willing to pursue treatment over along time period when improve ment was slow. Whether her problem would have disappeared without treatment orwhether other respon dents would have experienced comparable relief had they pursued a1onger course oftreatment with equal patience isimpossible todetermine from these data. Vivian neither began nor ended treatment with any strong faith inchiropractic. She regarded Dr. Blake as askilled practitioner for acertain set ofproblems, and nomore. She found therelief she was seeking, and had nomajor complaints about her contact with the clinics.218 These cases provide some indication ofthegreat diversity among people seeking alternative medical treatment. Such disparate individuals cannot be reduced toone or afew simple stereotypes. The complex, changing tangle ofbeliefs and motives involved inthe decisions tobegin, continue, and terminate alternative treatment must beunderstood interms ofdynamic feedback patterns. The many themes discussed chapters-- such asfear oforthodox medicine, medicine as atentative trial --take on 1ifein these case studies. The data obtained from semi structured interviewing provides much richer insight into complex questions ofmedical choice, effectiveness, and satisfaction than could data obtained in ashort survey that used only highly structured instruments. Future research inthese areas must beprepared to deal with the ambiguities ofinterview data orelse fully acknowledge the limitations ofmore restricted and guided responses.219 Chapter 7 Conclusion Theoretical Conclusions and Implications 1) Medical Belief Systems This research has some important implications for the theoretical understanding ofmedical belief systems. First there istheclassic question ofthe relationship between be1iefs and behavior. This study highlights the fact that there isnosimple, invariant relationship between beliefs and behavior; rather, there is acom plex feedback between these two realms. The dynamics ofthis feedback is akey problem not just inmedical anthropology, but in a11the social sciences. Inthe area ofmedicine, this research demonstrates that the same belief may becongruent with awide variety of behaviors and the same behavior may belinked todif ferent beliefs indifferent people. This implies that medical choice cannot beexplained byany simple striving for cognitive consistency. Conflict orcon gruence between apatient's world view and amedical system's doctrines may contribute somewhat tomedical decision-making inpluralistic situations, ofchoice220 in a11instances. Instudies ofdeveloping countries faced with the dilemma ofintegrating modern Western medicine with more traditional systems, many anthropologists have noted adivorce between medical beliefs and behaviors. As Ipointed out inanearlier discussion ofthe general question ofmedical choice, 1arge elements ofthe popu lation will accept Western medical practices without adopting the biomedical mode 1ofhealth and disease. This study has uncovered atwin set ofrelated phenomena inthe United States. Inthis sample, patients holding \"folk\" mode 1sfar removed from the biomedical mode 1 regularly relied onorthodox physicians for medical care. Furthermore, these respondents demonstrate that individuals who decide toseek out acupuncture may not have the foggiest knowledge about ideas underlying Chinese medicine ;those who seek outchiropractic by nomeans universally attribute all disease tospinal irregularities. Although specific ideas about the nature ofhealth and disease may bedifficult tochange and largely unrelated toquestions ofmedical choice, one belief about the nature ofhealth and disease is related tothe decision toseek medical care. This isthe general theme, reported bymost respondents, that anindividual isresponsible for his own health ;these people take anactive rather than afatalistic stance221 toward disease. Ifone cannot cure symtoms oneself, then seek out anexpert for help. Ifthat practitioner isunsuccessful, try another one--something can and should bedone when aperson issick. This study highlights the fact that itissome - times harder tochange aperson's behavior than to change hisbeliefs. This ismost apparent inthe area ofpreventive health. Midlife and older respondents alike testified tothe value of1arge numbers ofpreven tive health measures: correct diet, regular exercise, agood attitude, and soon. Very few people practiced a11 the measures they believed were related tomaintaining health. Almost every respondent who smoked mentioned some desire togive upthis habit. Some respondents were upset over their inability orunwillingness to properly practice preventive medicine, while others were quite relaxed about the shortcomings intheir daily habits. Ineither case, itisclear that simply educating people may besufficient tochange beliefs inthe area ofpreventive medicine, but this will in noway necessarily lead tochanges inbehavior.222 This study very much supports the hypothesis that the basis ofmedical innovation isneed. Aperson will rarely enter thetrial stage ofadopting amedical innovation unless there is aspecific problem which needs to bedealt with .Whether this innovation is accepted ornot depends largely onhow we11itis seen tosolve thepatient's problems. Similarly, the rejection ofpreviously medical behaviors, such asthe use ofdrugs, ismost bad experiences oranticipation ofproblems connected tothis behavior. At1east for this sample, beliefs and behaviors change largely as aresult ofspecific needs and experiences, either ofoneself orofothers. Another closely related question inthe area of medical beliefs isthe role ofthepractitioner in changing apatient's beliefs and/or behaviors. It has already been pointed out that there isnonecessary congruence between thebelief systems ofpractitioners and those oftheir patients. extent doprac titioners note this fact and try tosocialize their patients totheir own beliefs? Since the focus ofthis research was onpatients, Ican answer this question only in apreliminary way. Among the Oriental acupunc turists, there was almost noattempt toaddress the belief systems ofpatients. Infact, many respondents complained that they had very little understanding of223 what was going onand that their questions were not answered. Some ofthepatients ofthe American chiro - practor had very similar complaints ofinadequate explanation. However, other patients ofthechiropractor were dissatisfied because they felt thepractitioner was trying too hard tochange their health beliefs and practices (there was especially resentment about his frequent advice tobecome avegetarian). These respon dents felt that such pressures tochange their beliefs andpractices were unpleasant and unnecessary tosuccess - ful treatment. From these data itappears that aprac titioner can doonly avery limited amount tochange patients' beliefs and behaviors. Patients inthis research arehappiest when they receive adequate explanations and answers totheir questions, but are not challenged tochange any fundamental beliefs or practices. This resistance toattempts atindoctrination relates tothe question raised inthefirst chapter of thecultic orreligous nature ofalternative medicine. There are both parallels anddissimilarities between religious cults and medical alternatives. Especially among themidlife respondents, there was aphenomenon akin toconversion :the gradual orabrupt loss of faith incurative orthodox medicine and transfer of faith topreventive alternative medicine. Disi 11usion ment with the new object offaith frequently followed** ** *224 evidence ofitsfallibility. Inboth religion and this phenomenon ofmultiple conversions may berelated toinformation overload ofour current complex form ofcoping with the overabundance ofchoices involves ceaseless striving toward ever tions were keys ininterpreting thephysiological results also ritualistic aspects toalterna tive treatment: checking inatthe desk, waiting, going into special treatment space, perhaps partially disrobing, receiving treatment (which frequently in volved physical contact), getting dressed, checking out. There was special symbolism: people inwhite coats, acupuncture charts, the smell and \"knife 1ess\" inthe waiting room. These ritualistic aspects oftreatment borrowed heavily from orthodox medicine, which has largely shaped expectations ofthe format ofmedical treatment intheUnited States. Foreign elements were not integrated with patients' world views. For example, several oftheelderly respondents reacted negatively tothe--- * *22.5 sme 11ofmoxibustion, which they thought was mari juana orsome other similar drug. There are many differences between religious cults andalternative medical treatment. There was nosystematic attempt toindoctrinate patients with aspecific system of beliefs. Alternative practitioners did not demand the exclusive loyalty ofpatients, but recognized that patients would use several medical alternatives. From theperspective ofthe respondents, there was no need toselect only one treatment modality, asthere would betoselect only one religious sect. People inthis sample had faith incertain be1iefs (such as the curative power ofvitamin C), but rarely inspecific organized medical systems with recognizable names such as\"chiropractic\" or\"Chinese medicine.\" Both patients andpractitioners linked alternative medicine more closely toscience than toreligion. Although faith healing may be acultic activity, secular alternative medicine rests onnatural rather than supernatural beliefs. Thus, although acomparison ofreligious and medical behavior isindeed illuminating, the two are by no means identical. Astudy of apatient population more attuned tothe philosophy ofalternative medicine might uncover more similarities between cultic and medical phenomena.226 2) The Disease/Illness Distinction Inthefirst chapter Iraised the question of whether there was asharp line inmeeting human social and psychological needs between alternative medicine and orthodox medicine. These data overwhelmingly answer this question inthe negative. Although indi vidual doctors are condemned, patients inthis sample by nomeans perceive orthodox medicine as awhole as mechanical, unresponsive, and unconcerned with their needs. Alternative practitioners may befar more unsuccessful inmeeting patient's emotional and cognitive needs than are medical doctors. Moreover, different people look tomedicine fordifferent things. Not allpatients expect oreven want such things assympathy, attention, and personal advice from medical practitioners. Atleast for these respondents, the decision toinitially seek and tocontinue or terminate use ofalternative medicine rest far more onperceived physiological factors than oncognitive and emotional aspects ofmedical disease/ illness distinction, sopopular inthe medical anthro pology literature does not automatically oruniversally explain medical choice in apluralistic setting. Lock (1978) points out that ifwewish tomake Western medicine more humanistic, wemust generate227 support systems and symbolic meanings specific to American culture, not look tosupposedly more \"holistic\" systems inother cultures. The imitation ofsuch Systems isunlikely tosatisfy American social and psychological needs. Moreover, toseetraditional practitioners astreating mainly \"illness\" may under rate thephysiological effectiveness ofsuch therapy (Klein, 1978) and oversimplify acomplex reality. The classical East Asian medical system is frequently cited asanalternative which appear tooffer aholistic mode 1;that is, thesocial and cultural dimensions ofthe ex perience and meaning ofillness are assigned atleast equal importance tothe naming and removal ofspecific disease. Chinese -and Japanese-Americans who have been quietlypracticing acupuncture for years behind the scenes are sought out asteachers; and weekendconferences inEast Asian medicine have become fashionable. But the advocates ofholism are frequently disappointed because the doctors appear tosimply stick needles into theirpatients --there issome dietary advice offered but nopsychological counselling and nocathartic rituals are performed. inthe case place inthe doctor's presence. 3) Further Questions This study touches some crucial theoretical questions which require agreat deal more research. Iwill discuss briefly these important directions for future investigations. Weneed tofurther explore the dynamics ofthe relationship between medical228 effectiveness andsatisfaction. Especially interest ing isthe question ofhow apatient's mental state affects thephysiological outcome oftreatment. Another important problem istherelationship of apatient's initial expectancies about treatment tothe decision to seek alternative medical care, and effectiveness ofand satisfaction with such care. Such research must becon ducted in asetting where patients can beinterviewed before they ever see apractitioner. How dothese ini tial change important astreatment variables besides expectancies which may relate tomedical decision-making and evaluations of treatment were 1ittle considered inthis study and need to beincluded infuture research. Some ofthese factors arepatients' personalities, patients' value systems and self-images, and presence orabsence ofsocial support during illness. Weneed toinvestigate further the mechanisms through which alternative medicine produces positive and negative physiological effects. These mechanisms may relate closely tothose through which or thodox medicine works. C1arification ofthis theoretical problem may have great implications, therefore, for our ability totreat and prevent disease. Weneed torelate change and innovation onan individual level tochange many ofthese themes also emerged inthe discussion ofindividual respondents. How these two levels ofevents are con nected, however, remains tobeclarified. What isthe relationship ofmedical pluralism toother kinds of pluralism inAmerican culture and society? The presence ofvarious ethnic, social, religious, political, and economic groups and the presence ofmultiple life styles undoubtedly contribute tothe complex nature of the American medical system, but specific patterns and dynamics ofthis interre 1ationship arestill open questions for research. Wealso need far more comparative studies of a1ternative medicine inthe United States tomake up for past neglect field. Weneed tocompare modalities oftreatment: recently emerged healing. Wemust 1ook atpatients invarious areas ofthe country, indifferent size cities and towns, insuburbs and ghettoes, indifferent ethnic groups, in awider span ofage groups. Weneed todirectly compare alternative and orthodox medicine inacontrolled manner. Only then canthis study truly beset in a meaningful context.230 Practical Conclusions and Implications There are several important policy decisions which must bemade inthe area ofalternative medicine. To what extent and inwhich ways does alternative medicine need toberegulated? Should Medicare and other gover ment funded health payments cover theutilization of alternative medical practices 2Ifso, for which mo dalities and under what circumstances 2Should the govern ment sponsor health projects for the elderly using alternative medical techniques either alone orin combination with orthodox medicine? Towhat extent is itworthwhile for the federal government tofund research inthe development ofalternative techniques totreat chronic diseases toorthodox therapy? Should contributions tosuch research betax edu cating people inpreventive medicine? data toprovide abasis forintelligent answers tosuch crucial discisions. The primary conclusion here is the need for more research, asdiscussed above. However, the data presented here doprovide some clue astothe best direction for future action. Asignifi cant number ofpatients inboth age groups atthe Mayfield and Medical Centers did experience moder231 ate orcomplete symptomatic relief; others were helped inmore minor ways, such aswith dietary advice. Half the respondents were satisfied with their overall contact with these clinics. These encouraging results were obtained inspite ofthe unethical practices attheclinics, high turnover inpersonnel, and training ofseveral ofthepractitioners. Itseems likely that in amore stable setting with higher medical andethical standards, even more posi tive results would benoted. Atthis point wedonot know enough encourage the use ofspecific alternative modalities inspecific instances. Itislikely that further research, carried out inanobjective manner by people who are neither opponents nor proponents of alternative medicine, will allow ustomake the most efficient use ofalternative modalities. Such research should examine the effectiveness ofalterna tive medicine not only inaffecting observable path inimproving patients' feelings ofwell being andability tofunction. Evaluation and planning must also take account ofthe great diversity among patients. Until more data are obtained, patients must blunder along, often making random choices about what type oftreatment toobtain and where. There is a232 great need toprotect desperate people inpain, who are often willing totry anything, nomatter how dangerous orexpensive. Aside from protecting these individuals, Iquestion the need for anyfurther regulation ofalternative medicine atthis time, when wehave little but polemical danger medicine. Patients, infact, 1argely tryalternative modalities precisely for problems not amenable to Orthodox therapy inany case. Although there is aneed toguard ethicality, Ialso question whether there is more misrepresentation and insurance fraud in alternative than inorthodox medicine. Doctors must clean their own house before they will bethoroughly believable inexposing thenegative side ofalterna of alternative medicine fortreating theelderly, who are often afflicted with multiple chronic problems not responsive toorthodox treatment and who are especially susceptible, because ofmetabolic changes with aging, toexperience adverse side-effects from233 drugs. However, even iffuture research discovers that alternative modalities can beofvalue for the disease plaguing theelderly, such treatment will not beautomatically accepted bythe elderly onthe basis ofscientific study. Such therapy should be offered in apersonally convincing manner, accompanied byindividual testimonials that aperson was helped. This could beaccomplished through written material orthrough programs such asguest speakers atsenior centers oradult day care Aswith a11 forms ofhealth-related advertising, itwould be important toguard against misrepresentation and exaggerated claims. Especially when thepractitioner isfrom another culture, communication between patient andpractitioner must beexplicity facilitated. Alternative medicine also has thepotential of helping tocontain the future costs ofmedical care in the United States. Alternative practitioners donot require the extensive training necessary to aphysician; they may beeducated in1arger numbers and atlower equipment ormedications modalities isstill out ofthe reach of many people. The cost ofalternative care needs more investigation. Some alternative procedures, such ashair ** t\u00ba 7/234 analysis, may add tothe cost ofmedical care. Cer tain modalities are more cost effective than others. Anacupuncturist, for example, can handle patients much more quickly andefficiently than could ahomeo - pathist. This study ofalternative medicine also has some practical implications fororthodox medicine. Physicians need toconsider patients' ideas ofwhat they have and how they should betreated when health problems are complex orchronic. This accommodation tothepatient, however, may be aproblem initself; some conflict in the doctor patient relationship may beunavoidable in both orthodox and alternative medicine. But how far can weexpect thephysician toadjust himself tothepatient's lay (and sometimes bizarre) expectations without ceasing topractice modern medicine 7 The physician canlisten closely tothepatient and adjust himself only sofar. Ifhis adjustment istoo great, the physician denies Thus, wemay may, indeed, beforestalled byeducating physicians tobesomewhat more understanding andflexible with patients, but there is aline beyond which the physician cannot goand remain aphysician. Some patients' expectations cannot bemet. (Freidson, 1961; Moreover, need torecognize and fear ofmany aspects ofmedicine. This fear isacknowledged inchildren, who are often given candy orsome other3 &235 reward after seeing the doctor, but isconsidered unacceptable inadults. Although this fear ofmedicine may belargely in1ater life, it isstill very much afactor inmedical behavior. Physicians should especially deemphasize the use of drugs, and a11ay patients' anxieties when they feel medication isunavoidable. The Future ofA1ternative Medicine inthe United States Anticipating the future is arisky enterprise, made worthwhile inthis case bythe opportunity it provides forintegrating theoretical andpractical considerations inthe study ofalternative medicine and for gaining insight into the nature ofmedical pluralism inthe United States. Aconsideration ofthe future ofalternative medicine take account ofthe diversity within alternative medicine: theproliferating modalities may evolve indiverse directions and meet different fates. Acentral question ishow the relationship between orthodox and alternative medicine will change. Aconsideration ofthehistory ofalternative modalities inthe United States suggests that bemodified as aresult ofthe current impact ofalternative medicine. Inthenineteenth century, homeopathy taught some important 1eSSOns.236 During the 1860's and 1870's America's or thodox practitioners ofheroic medicine.

Hahnemann's main we11ofthemselves, ifleft alone.\" Asmore and more doctors recognized thatpatients did recover faster and with lessdiscomfort under mild remedies than under harsh orthodox treatments, heroic practices moderated, (Kaufman, 1971; p.110). Homeopathy also played animportant indirect role in the formation ofthe American Medical Association. The increasing popularity andrespectability ofthis modality made physicians aware ofthe need toorganize themselves and enforce strict standards within allo pathy sothat orthodox medicine would regain its lost prestige and influence. Today, patient dissatisfaction with Orthodox medical treatment and the surging popularity of alternative medicine are effecting changes within the dominant medical system. The growing utilization of lay midwives has resulted inchanges indelivery pro cedures and settings inmany hospitals and among many physicians (McGough etal., 1978). The current official biomedical interest innutrition, biofeedback, and imaging in1arge part originated inalternative237 modalities (Press, 1980). The increased awareness inorthodox medicine ofthe need touse more restraint inadministering drugs and surgery and topay greater attention tothe negative side-effects ofthese tech niques may berelated tothe espousal ofthese issues byalternative practitioners and their lay followers. Other major themes which seem tobeevolving in orthodox medicine --the emphasis onprevention asopposed toCure, rhetoric. Only history will te11how extensive and permanent these changes within orthodox medicine turn out tobe. The presence ofalternative competitors may also force orthodox practitioners totake increasing account ofproblems they might formerly have regarded asmar ginal totheir concerns. Patient desire for services for such complaints asoverweight, smoking, fatigue, and the need fornutritional counseling, which are currently brought in1arge numbers toalternative practitioners, may attract physicians totreat such problems. This would increase orthodox medicine's sphere ofinfluence and further the process 5. --23.8 Medicine began togrow competitors shelves. To dothis, ofcourse, ithad toforsake its dignity andtreat disreputable disease, over come its caution and take responsibility for problematic disorders for which patients unreasonably persisted inseeking cure, andcultivate some ofthe asorthopedics, urology, and ophthalmology. Medicine could not extend its domain without absorbing these folk practices, for they served apersistent demand that could not beignored with impunity. (Freidson, 1961; p.216). Thus alternative medicine, which attacks the legitimacy ofand seeks toweaken orthodox medicine, may ultimately have theparadoxical effect ofstrengthening and improv ing the dominant medical system. The direct adoption ofcertain alternative tech niques by asubstanital number ofphysicians is another possibility for the evolving relationship oforthodox and alternative medicine. Past studies ofmedical innovation andphysician behavior suggest Such change, ifitistooccur ata11, islikely beslow. value this isthe aim ofresearch. Progress isassociated With improvement. From this perspective, physicians who innovate byadopting new techniques which have been shown tobeofgreater value than past methods of treatment are actually more conservative, value-wise, than their more slow-acting colleagues (Menze 1,1960).g\u00ba **~ L. S.23.9 This isconsistent with the finding that doctors more integrated with their local professional networks tended toadopt the use of anew drug before more iso lated physicians did (Coleman etal., 1966). However, despite this abstract approval ofinno vation, Coleman etal. (1966) conclude that the average physician builds up acertain amount ofresistance to innovations. Changes inmedicine are sorapid that it isimpossible tokeep upwith a11new months tatively beput tofull use. The physician isfaced with the dilemma of whether todiscard atried and true method oftreatment, however imperfect, for anuncertain new therapy, which isanexperiential unknown. \"Heretics\" who areattracted tounorthodox ideas may bedeterrred offear ofthe disapproval oftheir colleagues (Inglis, 1964). medical techniques. \"Licensed physicians, already burdened byincreasing insurance rates, may find exclusions written into their policies absolving the insurance company ofliability forinjuries arising1.! \u00ba\u00ba *,/240 out ofthepractice find their policies cance 11ed inthe event that they are sued for injuries arising out ofunconventional practices. The present medical malpractice controversy which exists throughout the country isnot likely to increase the risk-taking propensities of aphysician concerned with making aliving and staying out of court.\" (Shepherd, 1977; p.200). Other factors favor the adoption byphysicians. One ofthe most important ofthese istheinability oforthodox medicine to satisfactorily treat many chronic diseases. Physicians, 1ike patients, are quite concerned with the perceived physiological effects of atreatment. Inthe early days ofhomeopathy, many allopaths adopted this orthodox techniques oftherelative ofhomeopathy intreat ing cholera, which was anepidemic disease atthat time (Kaufman, 1971). The overwhelming dominance oforthodox medicine a11ows this system tobeless defensive concerning some ofits unorthodox competitors (Wallis and More 1).,1976). The medically aware patient oftoday demands the \"lates t\"treatment, forcing the doctor out offormer patterns oftherapy (Coleman etal., 1966).241 Certain alternative techniques are more likely than others tobeadopted byphysicians. For example, the very \"foreignness\" ofacupuncture may increase isnot asthreatening The attitudes oforganized medicine towardchiropractic and acupuncture rationale acceptable toWestern medicine. Acupuncture isnow the object of much interest andinvestigation inAmerican medical circles, inmany places Insome areasacupuncture can now bepracticed only byorunder the supervision of a licensed physician, and the handful oftraditional practitioners are currently inviolation ofthe law. Since acupuncture is\"foreign\" and has almost nonon-orientalpractitioners inthis country, its takeover bymedicine was easy, free ofconflict, and somewhat exotic and \"1iberal,\" coming partially a1arger politicalrecognition ofChina. Onthe other hand,chiropractic ispurely American has been competing with what isnow established medicine. (Firman and Goldstein, 1975; p. 641). The above discussion suggests that research evidence ofthe effectiveness orineffectiveness ofvarious alternative techniques will not bethe only factor influencing the adoption ofthese modalities by physicians. Some ofthese techniques are highly specialized anddifficult tolearn; even physicians242 convinced oftheefficacy of atechnique may have to refer patients for treatment. Newspecialities, such asacupuncture, nutrition, and herbalism, may eventually appear within orthodox medicine. Past studies ofall types ofinnovation indicate that as more and more doctors come toadopt analternative technique, the rate ofadoption ofthe technique will increase. However, theutilization ofalternative techniques and the acceptance ofalternative paradigms are not the same thing. The history oforthodox medi cine compels the conclusion that the observed effec tiveness ofalternative will beexplained within Alterna tive paradigms are likely toinfluence orthodox models only insofar asthey can bearticulated with current scientific thought. This consideration ofthe effect ofalternative upon orthodox medicine has important implications for our understanding ofmedical pluralism and how medical systems change. Patients are animportant factor in the dynamics ofmedical innovation. Itisinthe interests ofthe dominant system toprotect itself by controlling ordestroying itsalternative competitors (Freidson, 1970). Patients, however, have questioned orthodox medicine's monopoly on1egitimacy and demanded access toand modalities, such aschiropractic, strongly condemned byphysicians. Public pressure has forced orthodox medicine toreevaluate its stance toward alternative medicine, paving the way for accelerated change within orthodox medicine itself and for the medical system as awhole (Wardwell, 1976). Alternative medicine also changes as aresult of its contact with orthodox medicine and other external and internal factors. The case ofhomeopathy isan instructive example ;Kaufman (1971) argues that isrepresentative ofthehistory ofmany other alternative modalities inthe United States. Soon after its introduction tothe United States, homeopathy could rarely befound inits \"pure\" original form. Instead, homeopathists more and more toresemble a11opaths. Intime, homeopathy largely disappeared as adistinct medical alternative. Today, however, anew development not discussed byKaufman has given anunexpected twist tothehistory rival, but one of agreat number ofother alternative techniques which constitute modern alternative medicine. Several authors have speculated onthe future of chiropractic, the most popular and well-known alternative!\"-\u00baf * =244 modality. Firman and Goldstein (1975) and Nofz (1978) predict that the role ofchiropractic inthe American health care system will remain stable ; chiropractic will continue tobe amarginal modality, independent and with no cooperative affiliations with orthodox medicine. White (1978) presents data which indicate that while nonacceptance ofthechiropractor by physicians may continue tohold, other segments ofthe established health care system-- consumer groups, members ofhealth planning agencies, and other health professionals --will push for arole forchiropractors within the orthodox medical system. Anderson (1979) compares thehostility between doctors and chiro - practors inthe ofmedical untouchability; individual chiropractors will not beable toimprove their hierarchical status independently ofthe profession as awhole. Wardwell (1980) writes that chiropractic isunlikely tofollow the lead ofosteopaths and merge with orthodox medicine. The most promising possibility forchiropractic would betoevolve into a\"1imited\" medical profession, such asdentistry, podiatry, optometry, and speech therapy have. \"These professions limit scope ofpractice to aspecific orits!\".A- \u00ba/> ! ss\u00ba245 functioning, and the range oftherapies they employ is also limited. Unlike chiropractic, they donot challenge orthodox medical theories ofdisease and therapy. Hence, they can coexist with organized medicine. However, the road can berocky.\" (Ibid., p.689.) Ifeel itisimportant torelate dalities. Today chiropractors compete notjust and other have begun to\"mix\" methods not only ofchiropractic and orthodox medicine, but ofchiropractic and many other alternative modalities. Dr. Blake is agood example of this inew breed ofchiropractors. Many patients donot distinguish between various alternative modalities, and will try any or a11they feel may provide relief. Chiropractic will change asitspatients change --from the predominantly Midwest rural c1iente 1eitevolved toserve toWest Coast urban patients with different ideas and expectations. One important question isthe extent towhich orthodox medicine and alternative modalities can and should becombined formally within the dominant medical system. Whether physicians will beable to work with alternative practitioners246 would most likely depend onthe nature oftheprac titioner; doctors may beable towork with secular practitioners more easily than faith healers. Onthe other hand, doctors may see faith healers less as competitors and more as alast resort orsomeone providing thepatient with hope; clergy freely visit patients inmodern hospitals. \"Folk\" healers may prove tobevaluable liaisons between doctors andpatients ofminority ethnic groups, but serve 1ittle cultural function with middle-class Caucasian patients. Har wood (1977), however, points out that both \"folk\" healers and members ofminority subcultures may oppose the integration ofthese healers into the orthodox medical system. One problem isthat alternative healers may not beable tofunction inbiomedical only contribute 1ittle tobiomedical care, but, what isworse might undermine this important form of healing.\" (Kleinman, 1978b; p.85). Garrison (1977) states that, inpractice, she has found itquite easy tobring about collaboration between Puerto Rican healers and mental health professionals; the question ofhow tooptimally develop this liaison, though, is complex. s\u00ba\u00ba2.47 Field (1971) mentions the need for specialized personnel whose role would betodirect thepatient tothepractitioner most likely tobeable tohelp him. LaPatra (1978) argues that cooperation between scientific and a1ternative medicine would result in mutual enrichment that would benefit a11patients. Collaborative endeavors inChina between traditional healers andphysicians demonstrates systems can, atleast onthe level ofprac tice, beeffectively integrated under certain cultural social circumstances (Araneta, 1977). Since medi cine istheoretica 11y, at 1east, based onscientific, empirical evidence there may bestrong pressure to integrate orthodox andalternative medicine onthe basis Wardwell (1972b) conceives ofthis happening in acyclical manner; orthodox medicine will expand and then contract its boundaries ofthe acceptable asthepluralistic medical system evolves. Unschuld (1976b) argues, however, that there islittle likelihood ofcooperation triumphing over competition between various alternatives inthe context ofaneconomically free health market. Asuni (1979) makes the important point that thecooperation ofvarious alternatives in apluralistic medical system isnot ofgreat importance tothepatient, who may use both orthodox and alternative medicines without248 the knowledge orapproval ofthepractitioners involved. Findings from this research suggest some other insights into the question ofthe formal relationship between orthodox and alternative medicine. Most pa- tients still regard orthodox medicine astheir primary source ofmedical care, especially incases ofserious disease. Orthodox medicine may, therefore, function tolegitimate alternative medicine; the Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers made conscious use ofthis fact byprominantly featuring the names of MDS atthese clinics. The combination ofdoctors utilizing altern ative orthodox medicine seems 11y appealing topatients inthis sample. This further serves todemonstrate that patient dissatisfaction, atleast for some Americans, iswith medical treatment itself, not the personhood ofdoctors orthe orthodox medical system. Alternative than asubsidiary oforthodox medicine inany formal context inwhich they are combined. Practitioners from various alternative modalities and physicians were able to cooperate to aslight extent within the context ofthe Mayfield and Davis Medical Centers. However, asystem within such a clinic.249 These data also indicate that alternative medicine will remain popular until orthodox medicine becomes more successful incuring common problems, such as pain, fatigue, and overweight, and in a11ying fear oftheharmful side-effects ofitspowerful techniques. Markle etal. (1978) similarly predict that, regardless ofresearch evidence, the Laetrile movement and the entire \"anti-cancer undergound\" will become increasingly active and popular until orthodox medicine can control cancer. Alternative medicine islikely tobemore than ashort-lived \"fad.\" Although the cultural changes asawareness ofenvironmental problems anddisillusion ment with imperfect science and technology, alternative medicine as amovement islikely tooutlast (and has outlasted) many other manifestations ofthese changes, such asthe annual celebration ofEarth Day. assuch. Many oftheproliferating oftechniques will gain little following and will die outrelatively quickly. Some well-known alternatives, such asacupuncture, may bemore or 1ess absorbed into orthodox medicine ifresearch proves their value. This type ofchange would berelatively slow. Increased communication between medical profes250 sionals level may speed the ofalternative techniques originating inother cultures. Iconcur those authors who argue that plur alism within amedical system isanadaptive isfunctional inallowing may bepreferable toconsistency inanuncertain and uncontro 11able world. Lock (1980) writes the existence of a variety ofapproaches tothealleviation ofsuffering ishighly functional inbeing able toabsorb segments ofthe population who for whatever reasons aredis satisfied with the dominant system. Sobel (1979) points out what isperhaps the most important reason for encouraging medical pluralism. The existence of unorthodox systems a11ows for alternative channels for therapeutic innovation. The orthodoxy isconservative bynature, encouraging research only within anaccepted ideology. Unorthodox systems may provide the stimulus for research into approaches not developed oreven considered inthe mainstream. For example, theinterest ofunderstanding role ofpsychological healing. Similarly, traditional healingceremonies call attention tocultural factors inhealing, while chiropractic and its kindred practices urge ustoreconsider the251 importance ofbody mechanics. Unorthodox medicine may also serve as acorrective to the therapeutic exuberance ofcontemporary medicine, ashomeopathy did inthe nineteenth century when extreme and often fatal treatments were the accepted practices. (Ibid. ;p.226). Inconclusion, then, Imust plead that alternative medicine beapproached in aspirit ofopen-mindedness by medical and social scientists, health planners and administrators, and the laypublic. There isneed for far more research on a11phases ofalternative medicine. These techniques should learn from the general disii.11usionment with orthodox medicine not topromise more than they candeliver, not tobetoo glib. Inthe long run, alternative techniques will find amore secure place inthe dynamic, pluralistic medical system ofthe United States through such dispassionate apprais a1than through extravagant and unsupported claims byproponents and unmitigated hostility toorthodox medicine. Patients will make their own evaluations of a11medical alternatives, in any case. The greater attention which isbeing focused recently onquestions ofethics inorthodox medicine should bespread may beeven freer toflourish. Bycleaning their own house inthis regard, alternative practitioners will pave the way for amore open-minded and unbiased attitude toward the medical potential and value ofalternative techniques and ideas.!4.252 BIBLIOGRAPHY Abelson, P.H.,\"AView ofHealth Research and Science K.Gale, Geographic Health Studies, 1975 a. ----- and Secular in aTaiwan Village: Culture, Medicine, and Psychiatry, 4:71-92, 1980.
