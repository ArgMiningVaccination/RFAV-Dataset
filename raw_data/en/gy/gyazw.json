Tuesday, August 09, 2022 [New Study Confirms Typhoid Vaccine Safety, Immune Response in Children](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/news/2022/New-Study-Confirms-Typhoid-Vaccine-Safety-Immune-Response-in-Children.html) A new study, published in The Lancet Global Health, finds typhoid conjugate vaccine, Typbar TCV\u00ae, provides immunity for up to 3 years in children as young as 9 months old in Malawi. The research - conducted by the Blantyre Malaria Project, Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust, and researchers at the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health (CVD) at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) - found that the TCV vaccine is safe and well tolerated. Importantly, the vaccine can be given to 9-month-old infants at the same time as routine measles-rubella vaccinations without reducing the immune response to either vaccine. Monday, August 08, 2022 [New Study Finds Rapid Decline in Vaccine-Boosted Neutralizing Antibodies Against Omicron Subvariant BA.5](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/news/2022/New-Study-Finds-Rapid-Decline-in-Vaccine-Boosted-Neutralizing-Antibodies-Against-Omicron-Subvariant-BA5.html) A study led in part by investigators at the University of Maryland School of Medicine's (UMSOM) Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health found that although COVID-19 booster vaccinations in adults elicit high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, those antibody levels decrease substantially within three months. Kirsten E. Lyke, MD, Professor of Medicine at UMSOM and scientist at CVD, is Co-Chair and site Principal Investigator for the study, and Meagan Deming, MD, PhD, Assistant Professor of Medicine at the UMSOM, also a scientist at CVD, is Vice-Chair of the study, which is a collaboration between investigators at the UMSOM's CVD and the Institute of Human Virology (IHV).
