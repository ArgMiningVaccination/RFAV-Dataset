Here is what you need to know about the updated (simpler) vaccine schedule. - Everyone ages 6 years and older who has received one dose of the updated (bivalent) Pfizer or Moderna vaccine is considered up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations - If you have never received a COVID-19 vaccine, you now only need to get one bivalent dose to be up to date. - If you have received only the original COVID-19 vaccine (those that were given in 2021 but are no longer available), you must get one bivalent dose to be up to date. - People 65 and older and some people who are immunocompromised may receive additional doses of the bivalent vaccine. - Children younger than age 6 still need multiple doses of vaccines. The number of doses will depend on their vaccination history. Vaccinate Your Child The best way to protect your child at school, around friends and at home is to get them vaccinated as soon as you can. Vaccinations are safe, effective and available in the pediatric practices of any of [our hospitals](/locations/?distance=10&facility_type=169&view-type=list-view) and select [Gotham Health Centers](https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/locations/?distance=10&facility_type=168&view-type=list-view). - Unvaccinated children ages 6 months to 4 years should receive three doses of the bivalent Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. The first and second doses are separated by three weeks, and the second and third doses are separated by at least eight weeks. - Unvaccinated children ages 5 to 17 should receive one dose of the bivalent Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. If your child is 6 months to 4 years old and a NYC Health + Hospitals patient, please call your child's pediatrician to schedule. If your child is not a NYC Health + Hospitals patient, use the [City's Vaccine Finder](https://vaccinefinder.nyc.gov/) or call 877-VAX-4NYC (877-829-4692) to schedule an appointment at certain sites, as well as to get other vaccination assistance.

Before Your Appointment You must reside in the United States to receive the vaccine. You will need to complete the [New York State COVID-19 Vaccine Form](https://forms.ny.gov/s3/vaccine) in order to get vaccinated. The State requires the provider administering the vaccine to check that you completed the form. Before you visit us for your vaccination, also keep in mind these tips: - Bring proof of age - A parent or guardian must provide consent for a child to be vaccinated. - Reschedule if you are sick - You will be unable to receive the vaccine if you have active COVID-19 or a COVID-19 test result pending. You should also reschedule if you are not feeling well on the day of your appointment. - Bring your health insurance card - COVID-19 vaccines are free with no out of pocket costs to all New Yorkers regardless of insurance status. But if you have health insurance, we will bill your insurance. For more information, visit: [New York State Department of Health](https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/) "}
