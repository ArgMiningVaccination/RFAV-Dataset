Together we intend to clear energetic blockages from your being, to open a flow of healing. We intend to support your alignment, heart guidance, inner knowing/compass, vitality and flow, in service to you, to all beings, and to the Earth. You are a Creator. You are a part of everything. Your choices, your intentions, and your active participation are essential ingredients in creating the life you desire and a new shared reality for all beings. Thank you for your good work. You are invited to a very unique and powerful healing ceremony that will support your intentions, clearing what does not serve and fortifying you as you step into your next manifestations for yourself, your purpose, and the collective. Inside this gentle container, your unique experience is our sacred focus. There's time for us to connect and talk before and after - space is held to lovingly unfold and behold what you bring for healing, release, empowerment and evolution. This is a time for your own deep listening and inner journeying. The container invoked for this work holds the energy in a powerful field of light, surrounded, supported and held by the elements and our guides from the seven directions. The container's potency is palpable and offers healing, just by being in it. Once we're in the container, you'll be gently guided toward your unique inner experience. Your conscious participation and intention are what invoke the medicine, which is delivered through sacred song, channeled sound and other sound tools, and hands-on energy work. You'll be guided to participate in moving the energy using vision, sensation, breath and/or sound. \"There is no sense of time or space - only sound and energy as my cells are filled with the Light.\" \"After both sessions I felt a sense of rejuvenation, as if whatever I felt stuck in was being lifted.\" \"The experience blew me away. I immediately felt safe and free to BE - to tap into my heart. One of the most transformational experiences of my life!\" This is an opportunity for healing, upleveling, deep self care and self honoring. Turn inward, witness your experience, and allow your visions and knowing to unfold. Collaborate with me, with your guides and with this energy medicine, in service to your unique incarnation. "}
