Legend says that when you hear the [Kambo](https://thethirdwave.co/psychedelics/kambo/) frog calling you to the medicine, your heart must answer. As we go through the challenges of our human experience, we accumulate pain and trauma in the cells of our being, often manifesting as dis-ease in our bodies, minds and souls. When the pain of remaining in that stagnant place of dis-ease becomes unbearable, that's when the frog medicine calls to us. Whether you feel the call to [detoxification](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78527-4) in your physical body or in your psycho-spiritual self, a sense of deep healing and \"reset\" of the immune system is often experienced following the Kambo purification ceremony.

Integration and Next Steps Identify toxins and parasites released from sessions. Review nutrition and supplementation. Vision and implement lifestyle changes to support your new invigorated self. What is Kambo? Traditionally, the frog symbolizes healing and spiritual cleansing, transformation and transition. Frogs can not endure a toxic environment and the Kambo frog medicine challenges you to release those emotions (like hatred, anger, bitterness, etc.) that hold you back. These outlooks show up in a person's aura like dark splotches, and in turn, decrease our natural protective and intuitive abilities. Indigenous tribes refer to this as \"panema.\" Ashaninka legend says [Kambo](https://floweroflifeperu.com/kambo/) facilitates the release of this \"panema\" - a negative energy or bad luck that gathers over time, visualized as a dark cloud or aura. Indigenous tribes felt that clearing this \"panema\", which they blamed for bad luck, depression, laziness, irritation, and other adverse states were of vital importance. (For more on the frog as a spirit animal, check out this [resource](https://whatismyspiritanimal.com/spirit-totem-power-animal-meanings/amphibians-reptiles/frog-symbolism-and-meaning/). We used her words in this description and wanted to properly attribute them to her.)

There are many types and blends of Rap\u00e9, all with different herbs in it.

Due to the stimulating effects of nicotine, Rap\u00e9 has an uplifting effect. To indigenous cultures, tobacco is a sacred plant known to cleanse both individuals and ceremonial spaces and is said to be a Grandfather medicine, full of ancient [wisdom](https://entheonation.com/blog/shamanic-guide-hape-snuff/) and the ability to carry our powers to Creator / Great Spirit / God / Goddess.

This sacred and potent medicine is used for healing physical and spiritual ailments, by clearing the mind and energies and gaining a complete new way of perception and focus. This Sananga is infused with intentions of absolute clarity and healing for the eyes as well as the inner sight, intuitive guidance, and opening up of the third eye.

Reiki is administered by laying the hands on the body or by hovering the hands a few inches above the body. According to reiki.org, \"The word Reiki is made of two Japanese words - Rei which means \"God's Wisdom or the Higher Power\" and Ki which is \"life force energy\".
