The 5,000-year-old Iceman discovered frozen in the Alps may have treated his gallstones, Lyme disease, and hardening of the arteries with the 61 tattoos that covered his bodymost of which matched acupuncture pointsand the walnut-sized pieces of fungus he carried on his belt. The herbal medicines chamomile and yarrow have been found on 50,000-year-old teeth, and neatly bored holes in prehistoric skulls show that Neolithic surgeons relieved pressure on the brain (or attempted to release evil spirits) at least 10,000 years ago. From Mesopotamian pharmaceuticals and Ancient Greek sleep therapy through midwifery, amputation, bloodletting, Renaissance anatomy, bubonic plague, and cholera to the discovery of germs, X-rays, DNA-based treatments and modern prosthetics, the history of medicine is a wild ride through the history of humankind. Color throughout Beware of whiplash as you track the evolution of medicine across the globe from the ice age to 2016. Remedies are lost and rediscovered during the rise and fall of empires; unsavory research begets ground-breaking health practices; knowledge is stolen, borrowed, given, distorted, and built upon through flurries of epidemics, religious mania, and superstition. Glimpse behind the Chamberlen Family shroud of secrecy that hid nothing less than the original forceps, passed down from generation to generation of highly successful birthing doctors in the 1600s. Peek out of an Italian study to the coast where a disgusting amount of sewage flowed into the ocean yet students swam in the area frequently and never became sick\u2014yet another example of how mold in its natural habitat served as a eureka moment for more than one scientist. Dive into the foundations of the common sense we take for granted and glimpse the trajectory of the future of medicine in the 50 discoveries between these pages. As with the rest of A History in 50 series, the authors of the medical volume include a prestigious medical professor and practicing OB/GYN Marguerite Vigliani, MD. The perspectives of both sides of controversial medical practices, including traditional medicine, research, and genetic practices, are respectfully yet shrewdly represented in each chapter. Furthermore, as is the practice of the series, a robust glossary, sources section, endnotes, and index accompany the engaging chapters written for the general population. Due to the human-centered nature of medicine, mistakes and discoveries aren't simply clunky, useless inventions or super speedy exploration devices like in A History of Travel in 50 Vehicles, but life-or-death remedies or epidemics. The commentary on the history of medicine show the depth of human flaw and frailty, but also the heroism and instinct buried deep within us and will leave the reader with a bright hope for the fruit of future medical collaboration. This was a fascinating read. I tried to do a chapter a day, so I could let it settle in my brain, but the narratives began like a mystery novel, and I'd just keep reading. From ancient Egypt to incredibly ignorant Victorian England (let's bleed you to make you better .... hmmm), to cutting edge tech, each story was interesting and informative. I came away thinking that I'd rather not be a recipient of new cures (how about some mercury to improve your health?), and with an appreciation of the incredible amount of work, often unrewarded, involved in each advancement. If I had a complaint, it was that the illustrations and text that went with them were soooo small. Otherwise, highly recommended. I loved this book, but it was aimed at those who have little knowledge of medical history. The information presented was a watered-down version of the discovery, so if you happen to know a lot about one of the subjects covered, you'll notice where they simplified the information and condensed it. However, I don't feel like this is necessarily a fault of the book since it isn't supposed to be in-depth on the subjects it covers, instead just presenting a general overview of the history of medicine. Since I wasn't familiar wiht most of the topics it covered, I found it a delightful read. I loved the pictures it included and the small sections in every chapter about the context around the discovery or other advancements that the discovery spawned. Also, the edition I was reading was a beautiful book. I'm looking forward to simliar books "}
