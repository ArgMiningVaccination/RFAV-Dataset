Results found that use of a traditional and/or faith healer seemed to have decreased over the past 13 years (from a range of 3.6- 12.7% to 0.1%). The prevalenc e of traditional male circumcision was found to be 24.8% generally and 31.9% among the African Black racial group. The range of use of alternative and compleme ntary medicine was from 0% to 2.2%. Local utilization sur veys of TMCAM for the last illness episode or in th e past year showed a variation in use of 6.1% to 38.5%. The pre valence of conditions treated at different TMCAM ou t-patients settings ranged from chronic conditions, complex of supernatural or psychosocial problems, mental illn ess, chronic conditions, acute conditions, generalized pain, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. TM and probably CAM is used by substantial proportions of the gener al population, but differences in study design and methodological limitations make it difficult to com pare prevalence estimates. Key words : Utilization, prevalence, traditional medicine, co mplementary medicine, alternative medicine, South Africa Introduction WHO defines \"traditional medicine (TM) as including diverse health practices, approaches, knowledge an d beliefs incorporating plant, animal, and/or mineral based medicines, spiritual therapies, manual techn iques and exercises applied singularly or in combination to m aintain well-being, as well as to treat, diagnose o r prevent illness\". \"Traditional medicine\" (TM) is a comprehe nsive term used to refer both to TM systems such as traditional Chinese medicine, Indian ayurveda and Arabic unani medicine, and to various forms of indigenous medici ne. TM therapies include medication therapies \u2014if they inv olve use of herbal medicines, animal parts and/or m inerals \u2014 and non-medication therapies \u2014 if they are carried out primarily without the use of medication, as in the case of acupuncture, manual therapies and spiritual therapi es. In countries where the dominant health care sys tem is based on allopathic medicine, or where TM has not been in corporated into the national health care system, TM is often termed \"complementary\", \"alternative\" or \"non-conve ntional\" medicine.\" (WHO, 2000) The term \"Complementary and Alternative Medicine (C AM) often refers to a broad set of health-care practices that are not part of a country's own trad ition and are not integrated into the dominant heal th-care system. \" Other terms sometimes used to describe these health -care practices include 'natural medicine', 'non-co nventional medicine' and 'holistic medicine' (WHO, Traditional , Complementary and Alternative Medicines www.africanethnomedicines.net Peltzer Afr. J. Trad. CAM (2009) 6 (2): 175 - 185 176 The U.S. National Institutes of Health has grouped them into five somewhat overlapping domains (http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam) as follows: \"Biologically based practices. These include use of a vast array of vitamins and m ineral supplements, natural products such as chondroitin sulfate, which is deri ved from bovine or shark cartilage; herbals, such a s ginkgo biloba and echinacea; and unconventional diets, such as th e low-carbohydrate approach to weight loss espoused by the late Robert Atkins. Manipulative and body-based approaches. These kinds of approaches, which include massage, h ave been used throughout history. In the 19th century, additional formal manipulative disciplines emerged in the Uni ted States: chiropractic medicine and osteopathic medicine. Bot h originated in an attempt to relieve structural fo rces on vertebrae and spinal nerve roots that practitioners perceived as evoking a panoply of illnesses beyond mere musculoskeletal pain. Mind-body medicine. Many ancient cultures assumed that the mind exerts powerful influences on bodily functions and vice versa. Attempts to reassert proper harmony between these bodily systems led to the developmen t of mind- body medicine, an array of approaches that incorpor ate spiritual, meditative, and relaxation technique s. Alternative medical systems. Whereas the ancient Greeks postulated that health r equires a balance of vital humors, Asian cultures considered that health depends on th e balance and flow of vital energies through the bo dy. This latter theory underlies the practice of acupuncture, for e xample, which asserts that vital energy flow can be restored by placing needles at critical body points. Energy medicine. This approach uses therapies that involve the use o f energy \u2014either biofield- or bioelectromagnetic based interventions. An example of the former is Reiki therapy, which aims to reali gn and strengthen healthful energies through the intervent ion of energies radiating from the hands of a maste r healer.\" Traditional medicine (TM) remains widespread in dev eloping countries, while use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasing rapidly in developed countries (Ernst, 2000; Harris and Rees 2000; WHO, 2002). TM is widely used and of rapidly growing hea lth system and economic importance. In Africa up to 80% of the population uses TM to help meet their health ca re needs. In Asia and Latin America, populations co ntinue to use TM as a result of historical circumstances and cult ural beliefs. In China, TM accounts for around 40% of all health care delivered. In Ghana, Mali, Nigeria and Zambia, the first line of treatment for 60% of children wi th high fever resulting from malaria is the use of herbal medicin es at home. WHO estimates that in several African c ountries traditional birth attendants assist in the majority of births. Meanwhile, in many developed countries, CAM is becoming more and more popular. In Europe, North Am erica and other industrialized regions, over 50% of the population have used complementary or alternative m edicine at least once. In San Francisco and London, 75% of people living with HIV/AIDS use TM/CAM. In the Unit ed States, 158 million of the adult population use complementary medicines and according to the USA Co mmission for Alternative and Complementary medicine s (WHO, 2002). WHO (2004) developed process indicators, as summari zed by the WHO Africa regional office and that was obtained from some experts on traditional medicine in the region (WHO, 2004), among others, as follows : (1) Estimated prevalence of national TMCAM use, (2) Est imated prevalence of national herbal medicine use, and (3) Medical determinants for TMCAM use. Although many populations in developing countries a re reported as depending heavily on TM to help meet their health care needs, precise data are lacking. Quantitative research to ascertain levels of existi ng access (both financial and geographic), and qualitative research to clarify constraints to extending such access, a re called for. There is a need to undertake specific, multidiscipl inary surveys in order to obtain data on process in dicators adequately (WHO, 2004). Towards the end of the 1990s, the total number of t raditional healers in South Africa was estimated to be around 350,000 (Bodeker, 2000) and an estimated 70 to 80% of South Africans consult traditional healer s (Department of Health, 2005; Kasilo, 2000). The Tra ditional Health Practitioners Act Traditional birth attendants (ababele thisi/abazalisi) (Gqaleni et al., 2007). In 2007 the number of regis tered allied health professionals, interns and stud ents (n=3622) in South Africa included 399 for Ayurveda, Chinese Med icine and Unani-Tibb (PBACMU), 541 for Chiropractic and Osteopathy (PBCO), 669 for Homoeopathy, Naturopathy and Phytotherapy, and 2013 for Therapeutic Aromatherapy, Therapeutic Massage Therapy and Thera peutic Reflexology (PBARM) (Gqaleni et al., 2007). The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic r eview of published and unpublished research investigating the prevalence of traditional, comple mentary and alternative medicine (TMCAM) use in the general population in South Africa. Peltzer Afr. J. Trad. CAM (2009) 6 (2): 175 - 185 177 Method The SEARCH STRATEGY included search online for publ ished and unpublished studies in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, GOOGLE Scholar, CINAHL, AJOL (Afri can Journals Online), South African e-journals and Sociofile. Key words for the search included: tradi tional medicine, complementary medicine, alternativ e medicine, faith healer, spiritual healer, herbalist, diviner, traditional birth attendend, traditional male circ umcision, survey, utilization, health-care seeking, South Africa. To qualify for inclusion, a survey had to address the prevalence of TMCAM, i.e. the percentage of people using it. Surv eys on sub-populations, such as patients with a con dition, e.g. HIV/AIDS, and traditional health practitioners list ing their common conditions they treat were also in cluded. In addition, secondary analyses were conducted with se veral national data sets (SABSSM I & II, South Afri can national HIV prevalence, Behaviour and Communication Survey) (Shisana and Simbayi, 2002; Shisana et al., 2005), WHS (World Health Survey South Africa).

Generally, the past mo nth use of a traditional and/or spiritual or faith healer seemed to have decreased over the past 13 years, surveys from 1995 and 1998 found a 3.6 to 12.7% use of a tradit ional healer, while surveys from 2005 to 2007 showed 0.1% or less use of a traditional healer. The range of use of a lternative and complementary medicine was from 0% to 2.2%. The use of TMCAM was higher for persons suffering from a m ental disorder compared to the general population (Table 1). Traditional contraceptive use and traditional birth attendance Comparing traditional contraceptive use between the 1998 and 2003 from the national demographic and health surveys (Department of Health, 1998, 2007), there has been a decrease in traditional contracept ive use from 9.8-13.4% in 1998 to 0.1% in 2003 (Table 2).

Various local studies found higher rates of traditional bir th attendance, in particular in rural areas, e.g. a mong 870 mothers in the rural Eastern Cape, 44.1% delivered their last child at home, 16.8% with the assistance of traditi onal birth attendant (Peltzer et al., 2006), and among 181 pos tnatal care clients in the Eastern Cape 36% had con sulted a traditional healer with their last pregnancy and 34 % for postnatal care (Peltzer et al., 2009).

Traditional male circumcision was mainly practiced among the African Black (31.9%) racial group. Yet, there were stark differences among different African ethnic groups in traditiona l male circumcision rates, ranging from among Zulu. The age of traditional male circumcision is across ethnic grou ps mainly 18 years and above (58.2%), followed by 1 2 to 17 years (33.1%) and 0 to 11 years (8.8%), while there are d ifferences by ethnic groups; for example for the Xh osa, Southern Sotho, and Tswana the age of traditional male circu mcision is mainly 18 years and above, and for the S wati, Northern Sotho and Tsonga it is mainly 12 to 17 yea rs, and for the Venda it appears the age of traditi onal male circumcision is below 12 years (Table 4).

The prevalence of TMCAM use of patients in biomedic al health facilities seems high for different types of conditions, such as snake bites, mental illness, HI V patients prior to antiretroviral treatment (ART) prior to biomedical and concurrenly with biomedical treatmen t (Table 6). The prevalence of conditions treated at different T M/CAM out-patients settings ranges from chronic conditions, complex of supernatural or psychosocial problems, chronic conditions, acute conditions, ge neralized pain, HIV and other STIs (Table 7).

J. Trad. CAM (2009) 6 (2): 175 - 185 183 Discussion and conclusion The data presented about the prevalence of TMCAM us e in South Africa show a general decline in TM use, a fairly wide variation in TM use and lack of data about CAM use among the general population. General ly, population-based and health facility-based surveys seem to indicate that TM use still plays an importa nt role in health care delivery in South Africa, covering a wi de range of conditions from chronic conditions, com plex of supernatural or psychosocial problems, chronic cond itions, acute conditions, generalized pain, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Other studies in S outh Africa have also indicated the importance of t raditional health practitioners in the treatment of these conditions, mental disorders (Havennar et al., 2008), cancer ( Steyn and Muller, 2000), diabetes (Ziqubu-Page et al., 1999; Peltzer et al., 2001b), hypertension and stroke (Peltzer et al., 2001a; The SASPI project team, 2004), childhood health problem s (Friend-du Preez, et al., 2008), and hearing impa irment (Andrade and Ross, 2005). The investigations included in the review differed markedly in their methodologies, origins and result s. Some surveys were aimed at determining lifetime pre valence of TMCAM use, while other investigators use d one- year, six months, one month or last illness episode prevalence data. The utilization of the different types of TMCAM were also not elicited, most studies only assessed the use of traditional healers and not that of fait h healers and CAM practitioners. Therefore, future surveys should dea l with all named therapies (including the major cat egories of herbalist, diviner, faith healer, traditional birth attendant, traditional surgeon and CAM therapies) rather than with TMCAM in general, be based on samples representativ e of general populations, assess point and one-year prevalence, and be based on adequate response rates (Ernst, 2000). Further research should also invest igate more systematically the concurrent use of TMCAM and biom edical health care. References 1. Andrade, V.D. and Ross, E. (2005).
