And for more information about how the vaccine works, see \" [How Shingrix works](/articles/326241#how-it-works)\" below. FDA approval The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Shingrix in 2017. Effectiveness For information about the effectiveness of Shingrix, see the \" [Shingrix uses](/articles/326241#uses)\" section below. Shingrix is available only as a brand-name medication. It's not currently available in generic form. Shingrix can cause mild or serious side effects. The following lists contain some of the key side effects that you may have while taking Shingrix. These lists do not include all possible side effects. For more information on the possible side effects of Shingrix or tips on how to deal with a troubling side effect, talk with your doctor or pharmacist.

See \"Side effect details\" below for more information. Note: Since Shingrix was approved for use, there have been reports of [Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/167892) in people who've had Shingrix. This is a rare condition that causes your [immune system](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320101) to damage your nerves, resulting in muscle weakness. Side effect details You may wonder how often certain side effects occur with Shingrix. Here's some detail on certain side effects this drug may cause. Injection site reactions You may have discomfort in the area of your arm where you get Shingrix. Symptoms may include: - redness - swelling - itching - rash It's not known how often these symptoms occur. Headaches In some [studies](https://www.fda.gov/media/108597/download) To find out how often this side effect occurred in clinical studies, see the drug's [prescribing information](https://www.fda.gov/media/108597/download) Allergic reaction As with most drugs, some people can have an allergic reaction after receiving Shingrix. Symptoms of a mild allergic reaction can include: - skin rash - itchiness - flushing (warmth and redness in your skin) A more severe allergic reaction is rare but possible. Symptoms of a severe allergic reaction can include: - angioedema (swelling under your skin, typically in your eyelids, lips, hands, or feet) - swelling of your tongue, mouth, or throat - trouble breathing - low blood pressure Call your doctor right away if you have a severe allergic reaction to Shingrix.

A live vaccine is one that contains a weakened form of a germ. Shingrix is not a live vaccine. It's an inactive vaccine, which is a vaccine that's made from a germ that's been killed. Because Shingrix is inactive, more people can receive it. This includes people with a weakened [immune system](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320101) (the body's defense against disease). People with weakened immune systems are typically advised against receiving live vaccines. This is because on very rare occasions, live vaccines can mutate (change) back to the full-strength germ that causes a disease. If this happens, people with weakened immune systems would have a much higher risk for developing the disease that the vaccine is meant to prevent. Shingrix is also a recombinant vaccine. This means that it's made of parts of the [shingles](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154912) virus, such as protein, sugar, or capsid (a casing around the germ). There used to be an alternative shingles vaccine to Shingrix. This other vaccine was called Zostavax. Like Shingrix, it was approved to prevent [shingles](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154912) is [no longer available](https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccination.html) Like a used help [shingles](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154912) (herpes zoster). However, Zostavax is [no longer available](https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccination.html) Below, we briefly describe the similarities and differences between these two vaccines. Uses Shingrix is approved for use in people: - ages 50 years and older - ages 18 years and older who have an increased risk of shingles Zostavax, on the other hand, was only approved for use in people ages 50 years and older. Neither vaccine has been approved for preventing [chickenpox](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/239450) (varicella). They also haven't been approved for treating shingles or postherpetic neuralgia, a complication of shingles that causes burning pain. Live shingles vaccine vs. non-live shingles vaccine A live vaccine is one that contains a weakened form of a germ. Shingrix is not a live vaccine. It's an inactive vaccine, which is a vaccine that's made from a germ that's been killed. Because Shingrix is inactive, more people can receive it. This includes people with a weakened [immune system](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320101) (the body's defense against disease). Zostavax was a shingles vaccine that was live. People with weakened immune systems are typically advised against receiving live vaccines. This is because on very rare occasions, live vaccines can mutate (change) back to the full-strength germ that causes a disease. If this happens, people with weakened immune systems would have a much higher risk for developing the disease that the vaccine is meant to prevent. CDC recommendation for the shingles vaccine [The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6703a5.htm) The CDC found that Shingrix was more effective than Zostavax. It recommends that you receive Shingrix, even if you've had Zostavax in the past. The following information describes dosages that are commonly used or recommended. However, be sure to take the dosage your doctor prescribes for you. Your doctor will determine the best dosage to suit your needs. Drug forms and strengths Shingrix is given as an [intramuscular injection](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323115), typically in your upper arm. You'll receive two separate doses of the vaccine. Each dose contains 0.5 mL of vaccine solution. A healthcare professional will give you the injections in your doctor's office or at a pharmacy. Dosage for shingles prevention Shingrix is given as two 0.5-mL injections in your upper arm. You'll receive two doses of this vaccine. Over time, some vaccines' protection begins to fade, so may you need booster doses. They help keep the vaccine working. But you don't need a booster dose after getting the two doses of Shingrix. Shingrix dosing schedule for people ages 50 years and older For people ages 50 years and older taking Shingrix, the second dose is given 2 to 6 months after the first dose. Shingrix dosing schedule for people ages 18 years and older with an increased risk of shingles For people ages 18 years and older with an increased risk of shingles who are taking Shingrix, the second dose may be given 1 to 2 months after the first dose. What if I wait too long to take the second Shingrix dose? [The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/hcp/shingrix/administering-vaccine.html) Also, if you get the second dose within 4 weeks after the first dose, it should not be counted. You should get your follow-up dose at least 1 to 2 months after the first dose, per your doctor's recommendation. There aren't any specific warnings or guidelines about alcohol and Shingrix. If you have concerns about drinking alcohol and getting the Shingrix vaccine, talk with your doctor. Shingrix can interact with several other medications. Different interactions can cause different effects. For instance, some interactions can affect how well a drug works, while others can cause increased side effects. Shingrix and other medications Below are medications that can interact with Shingrix. These are not all the drugs that may interact with Shingrix. Before taking Shingrix, be sure to tell your doctor and pharmacist about all prescription, over-the-counter, and other drugs you take. Also tell them about any vitamins, herbs, and supplements you use. Sharing this information can help you avoid potential interactions. If you have questions about drug interactions that may affect you, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone Taking Shingrix with drugs that suppress your immune system can cause problems with the way your body responds to Shingrix. Examples of immunosuppressive medications include: If you take any of these medications, talk with your doctor or pharmacist before getting Shingrix. Shingrix and other vaccines Shingrix is generally safe to use with or after administration of certain other vaccines. If you have concerns about whether other vaccines might interact with Shingrix, ask your doctor. Shingrix after Zostavax There used to be another [shingles](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154912) (herpes zoster) vaccine called Zostavax. Like Shingrix, it was approved to prevent shingles. However, Zostavax is [no longer available](https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccination.html) If you've had Zostavax in the past, you should still receive Shingrix, according to [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/shingrix/index.html) Shingrix and the flu shot There is no evidence showing any negative effects from taking Shingrix together with the [flu vaccine](https://www.healthline.com/health/flu/importance-of-flu-shot). According to a [study](https://www.fda.gov/media/108597/download) [shingles](https://www.healthline.com/health/shingles) and flu vaccines at the same time was safe. Also, it didn't make either vaccine less effective. Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about Shingrix. Can I get the Shingrix vaccine if I have an egg allergy? Yes. It's safe for you to get the Shingrix vaccine if you're [allergic to eggs](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8624#eggs). Shingrix doesn't contain any egg protein. But certain [flu vaccines](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312469) may contain egg protein. If you have an egg allergy, be sure to tell your doctor before getting any vaccines. I'm living with HIV. Is it safe for me to get Shingrix? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hasn't made a recommendation about the use of Shingrix in people living with [HIV](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/17131). However, one [study](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/211/8/1279/916271) looked at healthy adults ages 18 and older who were living with HIV and had an HIV dosing schedule that was customized to their needs. These people received the Shingrix vaccine, and the study results did not report any safety issues. If you're living with HIV, talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of getting Shingrix. What's the age range for getting the Shingrix vaccine? Shingrix is approved for use people: - ages 50 years and older - ages 18 years and older who have an increased risk of shingles There's no upper age limit for getting Shingrix, so there isn't a set age range. How safe is Shingrix? The FDA has approved Shingrix for preventing [shingles](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154912) (herpes zoster) in adults. The results of several [studies](https://www.fda.gov/media/108597/download#section-10.1) There have been concerns about ingredients, such as [thimerosal](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/327198#Preservatives,-stabilizers,-and-emulsifiers), that may be added to vaccines. Thimerosal is a kind of preservative that contains mercury. It's added then taken out of some vaccines to keep other germs and bacteria from growing. The concern arose when early research connected thimerosal to [autism](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323758). This link has since been found to be false. Shingrix doesn't contain thimerosal. Can I receive Shingrix if I have shingles or if I had shingles in the past? The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/shingrix/index.html) [shingles](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154912). It's best to wait until your shingle rashes have gone away before you receive Shingrix. If you've have had shingles in the past, you can take Shingrix. It may help prevent future shingles infections. Can I get Shingrix if I've never had chickenpox? If you've never had [chickenpox](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/239450) (varicella), the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/shingrix/index.html) If you can't recall whether you've had chickenpox, you may need to be screened for it. But this will depend on your age. It's assumed that people born in the United States and elsewhere before 1980 have been exposed to chickenpox. Therefore, you may be able to receive Shingrix. You should check with your doctor first to make sure. Can Shingrix cause a rash? It's unlikely that a Shingrix injection will cause a rash. But note that an injection site reaction is different from a [shingles](https://www.healthline.com/health/shingles) rash. (See \"Injection site reactions\" in the \" [Shingrix side effects](/articles/326241#side-effects)\" section above.) A shingles rash, which is caused by shingles itself, is often painful. It commonly appears as blisters around the torso, neck, or face. People who received Shingrix in [clinical studies](https://www.fda.gov/media/108597/download#_Ref) However, [studies](https://www.fda.gov/media/119879/download) [no longer available](https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccination.html) [Shingrix vs. Zostavax](/articles/326241#shingrix-vs-zostavax)\" section above to learn more.) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves vaccines such as Shingrix to prevent certain conditions. Shingrix for prevention of shingles Shingrix is a vaccine that's used to prevent [shingles](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154912) (herpes zoster). It's approved for use in people: - ages 50 years and older - ages 18 years and older who have an increased risk of shingles People with an increased risk of shingles include those with a weakened [immune system](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/320101), such as people with HIV. Shingrix is not meant for use in preventing [chickenpox](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/239450) (varicella). Effectiveness for prevention of shingles Shingrix has been found to be effective in helping to prevent shingles. For details on how the drug performed in clinical studies, see Shingrix's [prescribing information](https://www.fda.gov/media/108597/download#_Ref) [The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/shingles-recombinant.html#why-vaccinate) - all adults ages 50 years and older - adults ages 18 to 50 years with a weakened immune system Your body responds to germs by making antibodies. These are proteins that fight off specific germs. Antibodies also help prevent future infections by remembering the germs so they can fight them off more quickly. Vaccines are made from germs, or pieces of germs, that help your body imitate an actual disease. This prompts your body to create antibodies. Shingrix introduces proteins from the [shingles](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/154912) (herpes zoster) virus to your body. Your body responds by protecting itself from infection by the shingles virus. This is called an immune response. How long does it take to work? It takes time for your body to make enough antibodies to fight off germs and protect you from certain diseases. Results from [clinical studies](https://www.fda.gov/media/108597/download#section-10.1) How long Shingrix takes to work may not be the same for everyone. The timing for you will depend on your body chemistry. In general, you should be protected from shingles soon after the second dose. There haven't been any studies in humans to know if it's safe to get the Shingrix vaccine when you're pregnant. [Studies in animals](https://www.fda.gov/media/108597/download) If you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant, wait until after you've had your baby to get the Shingrix vaccine. Talk with your doctor if you have any concerns. There haven't been enough studies to show whether Shingrix appears in breast milk. Until more is known, it's best to wait until you've finished breastfeeding before getting Shingrix. Before receiving Shingrix, talk with your doctor about your health history. Shingrix may not be right for you if you have certain medical conditions. These include: - Allergic reactions to vaccines. People who have had allergic reactions to vaccines in the past may be at risk again for an allergic reaction to Shingrix. If you have had an allergic reaction to vaccines before, talk with your doctor and have them review your immunization history. You may need additional treatment and supervision to receive Shingrix.
