There are many reasons an energy center can be out of balance but resolving the issue completely goes back to a person mentally choosing to do the self-healing work that is required in addition to what the healer can offer. So much of this work requires the will to change. Change is not always easy. Chakra balancing is the process of restoring a harmonious flow of energy across your chakra system. When your chakras are balanced, you will feel relaxed, centered, grounded, energized, and aware. There are many ways to help balance and open the chakras, including: - Meditation - Yoga - Wearing or using chakra healing stones and crystals - Eating certain foods or spices associated with the chakra - Aromatherapy and flower essences - An Energy Work Practitioner can help their client get inside that energy center and learn why it is unbalanced; it might be a patterned way of thinking, words of someone else, old traumas, or not listening to your inner self. - Reiki by its inherent nature has a clearing and balancing affect on all of your energy centers. Each chakra has different elements, colors, foods, and asanas associated with it. While many of these above mentioned methods can be done by you alone, by incorporating those elements and practices into daily life in conjunction with a healing session with a practitioner, a person can help speed his or her healing process. It is important to note that a chakra balancing is not an instantaneous magical event that will solve your issues for good, as it is often made out to be. You have to be willing to change and ready to heal. We also are human, living and learning as we go, there will always be ups and downs of our energy but consciously maintaining our energy will help us navigate life more easily. There are a variety of services and classes offered here at the studio to help bring your energy back into balance.
