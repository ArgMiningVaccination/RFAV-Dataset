INTRODUCTION 1.1 Objectives of the Guideline The purpose of this document is to recommend international standards for, and promote harmonisation of, the nonclinical safety assessments to support th e development of pharmaceuticals intended for paediatric use. Harmonisation of the guidance for nonclini cal safety studies will define the current recommendations and reduce the likelihood that substantial differences will exist among regions. It should facilitate the timely conduct of paediatric clinical trials and reduce the use of animals in accordance wi th the 3R (replace/ reduce/refine) principles. 1.2 Background Guidelines have previously been issued by various regulatory agencies and are not in complete agreement on whether a juvenile animal study (JAS) is advisable and its timing and design. This guideline is intended to complement and expand on existing ICH guidelines (e.g., ICH E11, M3, S5 and S9) and reflects current thinking based on collations of examples by regulatory agencies, by industry surveys, and literature. 1.3 Scope This guideline recommend s an approach for the nonclinical safety evaluation of pharmaceuticals intended for development in paediatric populations. This can include products with prior adult use, as well as products being considered for initial human use in paediatric s (see Section 4) . The ICH S9 guideline should be consulted for recommendations on whether to conduct a JAS for those pharmaceuticals included in the scope of the ICH S9 guideline , i.e., anticancer pharmaceuticals. Th e ICH S11 guideline should be consulted for study design in all cases , including oncology indications . Small molecule therapeutics and biotechnology -derived pharmaceuticals as defined in ICH S6 are within the scope of this guideline. Tissue engineered products, gene and cellular therapies, and vaccines are excluded from the scope of this guideline because d edicated juvenile animal safety studies are generally not warranted for such products. However, some of the thinking outlined in this document about evaluating safety with existing information can apply. 1.4 General Principles Paediatric patients who can receive pharmaceuticals during periods of rapid growth and/or postnatal development of several organ systems, represent a distinct population when compared to adults . Immaturity of organ systems and maturation of systems during drug treatment can affect dr ug pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) , and/or off -target effects of pharmaceuticals , potentially leading to differences in safety and/or efficacy profiles between paediatric populations (as described in ICH E11) and/or when compared to adults. An understanding of the overall clinical development plan is needed to design an appropriate, efficient nonclinical plan. A weight of evidence (WoE; see Section 2) based decision should be made to determine whether additional nonclinical investigations are w arranted to support the paediatric population. As clinical development progresses, adjustments to the WoE can be made based on all the available data at that time. The outcome of a WoE assessment can be different for different applications of the same phar maceutical depending on paediatric age, indication ICH S11 Guideline 3 and duration of treatment . Note that in accordance with ICH M3, juvenile animal toxicity studies are generally not considered important to support short -term PK studies in paediatric populations. An e arly consideration of nonclinical support for paediatric pharmaceutical development is recommended. In this res pect, chang ing the design and/or timing of the traditional nonclinical program is one way to address potential safety concerns for the paediatric patient . For example, dosing can be initiated at a younger age in a repeat ed-dose toxicity study to support the corresponding developmental stages in p aediatric patients . Another approach could be to conduct the Pre- and Postnatal Development ( PPND ) study earlier than the normal drug development paradigm (see ICH M3 and S6) , with modifications such as toxicokinetics ( TK) in offspring and additional endpoints. These changes can replace or refine the design of a JAS. The conduct of additional nonclinical investigations should be undertaken only when previous nonclinical and human data are judged to be insufficient to support paediatric studies. A JAS is designed to address safety concerns that cannot be adequately addr essed in other nonclinical studies or paediatric clinical trials, including potential long -term safety effects. This guideline recommends a customi sed JAS that comprises core design endpoints and potential additional endpoints driven by specific concerns. Some regulatory agencies have procedures for defining pa ediatric development plans ( see ICH E11). Early regulatory interaction, prior to initiating a JAS, is encouraged for efficient paediatric drug development. 2. CONSIDERATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL NONCLINICAL SAFETY INVESTIGATIONS 2.1 Clinical Context The p aediatric clinical development plan for a pharmaceutical is discussed in the ICH E11 guideline and needs to be understood before an appropriate nonclinical pl an can be designed . The p aediatric cl inical plan includes the indication/condition, the intended paediatric age group(s), and the treatment regimen (particularly , the duration of dosing during the stages of development). The clinical development of a pharmaceutical for paediatric patients usually follows initial adult c linical studies but can occur in parallel or can be conducted without any adult clinical studies . Whether additional nonclinical investigations are advisable, and their design and timing , will depend on the identified safety concerns and the intended paediatric clinical use. For severely debilitating or life -threatening diseases , or diseases with serious unmet medical need in a paediatric population, the sponsor and regulatory agencies should consider the benefit of producing data in addition to existing studies versus the potential delay in patient access to a pharmaceutical caused by additional nonclinical testing . The decision whether to perform nonclinical testing and its timing should be based upon a thorough risk-benefit evaluation. In these conditions, i f a safety concern is identified as new information is generated , appropriate nonclinical studies should be considered, and could potentially be conducted in parallel with ongoing paediatric clinical investig ation s. 2.2 Weight of E vidence A pproach The nonclinical development plan for a paediatric pharmaceutical depends on an integrated assessment based on the totality of the evidence, including the clinical context together with ICH S11 Guideline 4 the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic (ADME) , and nonclinical in vitro and in vivo animal , and clinical safety data (adult and/or paediatric) , i.e., a WoE approach . A Wo E approach considers multiple factors evaluated together and, therefore, a single factor should not be considered in isolation. The importance of each factor should be considered such that the final decision concludes whether available data adequately address safety concerns in the proposed paediatric population or whether additional nonclinical studies would address those concerns . In addition, the translatability and biological relevance of the JAS data to humans should be considered. The WoE evaluation should be conducted when designing the initial paediatric development plan, but reassessed if there are ne w safety signals in nonclinical or clinical studies, changes in age ranges , route of administration, treatment duration, drug product formulation and/or indications . The WoE outcome can be different for each trial depending on the paediatric population and the disease to be treated. Figure 1 shows key factors that should be considered as part of the W oE evaluation. The most important factors (i.e., the most highly weighted) are the youngest intended patient age, and whether there are suspected adverse effects on developing organ systems of the patient s. The other f actors are not listed in order of importance in the figure . The list is not all inclusive for every situatio n, as there may be additional specific factors to consider (e.g., risk mitigation ). The WoE factors are further described in the following sections .

The most important facto rs that should be highly weighted (listed first) are the youngest intended patient age and whether there are suspected adverse effects on developing organ ICH S11 Guideline 5 systems of the patients during the conduct of the paediatric trial. The other factors are not listed in order of import ance. 2.3 Considerations to Inform the Weight of Evidence Evaluation 2.3.1 Clinical Information (WoE Factors: Youngest Intended Patient Age; Amount/Type of Existing Data; Clinical Treatment Duration) The youngest intended patient age is one of the most important factors to be considered. As stated in ICH E11, any classification of the paediatric population into age categories is to some extent arbitrary, but a classification such as the one in Figure 1 provides a basis for thinking about the nonclinical testing to support safety in such patients. Decisions on how to stratify by age should focus on developmental biology. Additional nonclinical studies are more likely to be warranted to support younger pa ediatric age ranges. The existing clinical data relevant for intended paediatric patients come from other paediatric subpopulations (if available) and adult s exposed to the pharmaceutical . Therefore, t his established clinical safety profile is usually one of the first point s to consider when determining if additional nonclinical studies are warranted. The duration of clinical treatment is another factor in determining whether additional nonclinical studies are warranted. Longer durations of treatment (e.g., 3- month, 6- month, chronic intermittent) are more likely to expose a p aediatric subject during a developmentally sensitive window and are, therefore, more likely to warrant further nonclinical studies than short -term treatments. Short -term exposure t o a pharmaceutical is less likely to affect aspects of development such as growth. H owever , even a short -term exposure can have deleterious effects if it occurs at a vulnerable time of organ development . Additional nonclinical studies are not warranted when existing clinical safety data and risk mitigation strateg ies are considered sufficient to support paediatric use . In addition, a JAS is not warranted to confirm toxicity in target organs in which sensitivity to toxicity is not expected to differ betwe en adults and paediatric patients . Differences in target or off -target tissue development are a concern that should be considered. If adult clinical data are available and exposure is not occurring at a vulnerable time of organ development, a JAS is not considered important to support initiation of short -term PK studies in paediatric patients (see ICH M3). 2.3.2 Pharmacological Properties (WoE Factors: Effects on Developing Organ Systems; Pharmacologic al Target has Role in Organ Development; Selectiv ity and Specificity of Pharmaceutical) Primary or secondary pharmacological properties of a pharmaceutical can be responsible for unwanted side effects . This can raise concerns for paediatric use if effects occur in systems/organs in development or if deve loping organs have a different sensitivity from mature organs. A review of the literature on the developmental expression and ontogeny of the pharmacologic al target(s) (e.g., receptor s, enz ymes, ion channels, protein s), or the known or potential role of the target during development is recommended . Existing d ata from genetically modified animals (e.g., the knock- out of a receptor) m ight also identify developmental effects of potential relevance for the paediatric population, which could be included in the WoE evaluation. ICH S11 Guideline 6 If the known pharmacology of a pharmaceutical has the potential to impact development in the intended paediatric population, or the role of the pharmacology on development is not understood or not reasonably predictable, further nonclinical investigations should be considered. Potential adverse effects of pharmaceuticals with high selectivity and specificity for their target (e.g., monoclonal or bispecific antibodies) are more likely to be related to exaggerated pharmacology and t herefore can be more predictable than effects of pharmaceuticals with lower selectivity or specificity for their pharmacologic al target. Pharmaceuticals with lower selectivity or specificity can have secondary pharmaco dynamic effects and thus are more likely to warrant further nonclinical investigations. I n vitro or ex vivo investigations using juvenile (i.e., animal) or paediatric (i.e., human) tissues or matrices (e.g., serum, urine) might be useful to determine potential age -related differences in sensitivity . Further nonclinical studies might not add value when the existing pharmacology information has already identified a particular hazard unless a more detailed understanding of the dose- response relationship or differences in sensitivity between adult and juvenile animals is warranted . 2.3.3 Pharmacokinetic Data (WoE Factors: Amount/Type of Existing Data) Maturation of systems important for ADME such as the gastrointestinal, liver and renal systems can result in rapidly changing systemic exposures in humans and in animals, leading to potential age-related differences in efficacy and toxicity. In humans, t hese differences are usually most prominent in neonates and infants. Clinical pharmacology and modelling and simulation tools are considered useful to contribute information on the pharmacokinetics, and also pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of a drug in pa ediatric subjects (see ICH E11). In general , a JAS is not informative in predicting or recapitulating age -related differences in human ADME. 2.3.4 Nonclinical Safety Data (WoE Factors: Effects on Developing Organ Systems; Amount/Type of Existing Data) Existing nonclinical data should be evaluated for findings that could indica te potential effects in organs undergoing development in paediatric subjects. Findings occurring in animals at similar exposures as those likely to be achieved in paediatric subjects are of increased concern, particularly if the findings occur in organs/ti ssues that undergo critical postnatal development at the intended paediatric age (see Appendix A ). Safety s ignals in adult animals in more than one species are of increased concern. It can still be appropriate to evaluate the potential impact on paediatric subjects of a toxicity that occurred in adult animals that did not translate to adverse effects in adult humans if the target organ/system is undergoing development in the relevant paediatric population. Depending on the age of the animals at initiation o f dosing and the endpoints included, some of these concerns may have been addressed in existing toxicity studies. Genotoxicity testing and safety pharmacology investigations are normally conducted to support adult clinical trials and, therefore, should be available before paediatric clinical trials commence. If a safety pharmacology study shows an effect in an organ system undergoing structural or functional development and maturation in the intended paediatric patient population, the possible impact of the effect should be considered. Additional genotoxic ity and safety pharmacology assessment s in juvenile animals are generally not appropriate to support paediatric indications. ICH S11 Guideline 7 Reproductive and developmental toxicity study data may also be available and can be informative . If PPND /ePPND study data are available and have shown clinically relevant systemic exposures in offspring during the postnatal period, these data can contribute to the WoE evaluation (see Section 1.4) . For ePPND studies conducted in the non- human primate (NHP), the data from the offspring can characterise toxicity during early postnatal development, provided relevant exposure and/or PD effects are confirmed in the offspring. When available, PPND/ ePPND d ata should be evaluated in combination with data from the general toxicity studies in assessing the potential added value of conducting additional nonclinical investigations. Maternal and fetal tolerance of the drug should be considered because they could influence interpretation of the findings in offspring. Observations of adverse effects in offspring would not, on their own, indicate that a JAS is recommended. However, if a safety concern was identified in the PPND/ePPND study , it should be considered in the WoE evaluation. In rodents, t hese data are primarily relevant to preterm and term neonates if exposure is demonstrated. H owever, the species -specific development of an organ system should be considered when determining human relevanc e. If data from a previously conducted JAS are available, they should be considered in the WoE. 2.3.5 Feasibility The decision to conduct an additional animal stud y should also consider the technical and practical feasibility of the study design and endpoints . Some endpoints might not be practical in some species (see Section 3 for further discussion of this point ). In addition, i f a dose range finding ( DRF ) study in juvenile animals indicates that a definitive JAS cannot be conducted at appropriate systemic exposure s or relevant ages in the range of those expected in paediatric patients , such a study might not be informative or warranted (see also Section 3.2 and 3.6) . 2.4 Application and Outcome of t he Weight of Evidence Evaluation The WoE approach should be applied to determine whether additional nonclinical investigations are warranted , with emphasis on the factors considered most important to inform the clinical risk assessment. When a study is deemed warranted, t he specifics of the identified safety concer ns should define the aim of the nonclinical investigation ; this could be a JAS or another study (e.g., in vitro or ex vivo investigations). For a JAS, the study objectives should be aligned with the WoE outcome and the intended paediatric use. This is essential to appropriately design and customize the JAS with regard to the treatment period and endpoints to be included. Examples of applying the WoE approach are in Appendix B . 3. DESIGN OF NONCLINICAL JUVENILE ANIMAL STUDIES 3.1 General Consi derations/Study Objectives This section contains recommendations on study design, core endpoints, and additional endpoints that can be included to address specific concerns. A JAS design including all potential additional endpoints is not recommended without a rationale for each additional endpoint . A JAS should be conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices. ICH S11 Guideline 8 The stage of maturation of human and animal organ systems can influence susceptibility to toxicity. Understanding the relative level of maturity and function across species during development is needed not only to design the appropriate JAS but also to aid the translat ion of nonclinical toxicity findings to human age categories . Comparison of development across species can be challenging and is not uniform across different organ systems . For example, the relative maturity at birth, rate of postnatal maturation, and/or r egulation of maturation are quite different between humans and animals. While not comprehensive, Appendix A, Tables A1-A5, provide an overview of comparative development of organ systems by species . 3.2 Dose Range -Finding Studies A DRF study with small gr oup sizes of juvenile animals is recommended to assess tolerability in relation to exposure and age . This is particularly valuable to design a definitive JAS when dosing starts prior to weaning to avoid unexpected mortality or excessive toxicity , often due to irrelevant exposures. Dosing should include the youngest planned starting age of the animals in the definitive JAS to evaluate the most critical period for tolerability and exposure differences. DRF studies typically are of short duration, have limited endpoints and are not expected to include all core endpoints (e.g., pathology). DRF studies can also be used to explore particular endpoints and thus refine the study design of the definitive JAS. DRF studies are not necessarily conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices. A DRF study can reveal important information for paediatric development. Differences in exposure between age ranges can be identified in a DRF. This might necessitate an adjustment to the dosing regimen in the definitive JAS (See S ections 3.4 and 3.7). Alternatively, lack of tolerability in a DRF at anticipated paediatric clinical exposure might indicate a significant concern for the corresponding clinical age range (i.e., the juvenile animals are unexpectedly sensitive, potentiall y related to their immaturity, which can have clinical paediatric relevance) . When the reason for greater sensitivity or significant differences in toxicity is not understood, additional investigations guided by review of available ADME, safety and develop mental biology knowledge can be useful for the interpretation of these differences. This situation might warrant a customized investigative JAS to further define the sensitive age window and/or understand the possible mechanism of toxicity. Results could have safety implications for a specific paediatric age which m ight alter the intended paediatric clinical age range, and thus the WoE should be revisited (See Section 2.2). 3.3 Animal Test S ystem Selection When a JAS is warranted, in most cases a single species is considered sufficient. In principle, the same species as used in adult repeat ed-dose studies should initially be considered as the species for a JAS , preferably a rodent . In all cases, the selected species should be justified , as nonclinical studies in a pharmacologically non-relevant species can give rise to misinterpretation and are not recommended. The following factors should be considered when selecting a relevant species: An understanding of the ontogeny of the pharmacological or toxicological target (e.g., the receptor) in animals in comparison to that in the intended paediatric population Preference for a species and strain for which adult repeated -dose toxicity data are available to facilitate a comparison of the toxicity and systemic exposure profiles between juvenile and adult animals Toxicological target organs ICH S11 Guideline 9 o the relative stage of organ/system development in the juvenile animal as compared to the intended paediatric population (see also S ection 3.4) o the ability of the animal model to detect toxicity endpoints of concern Similarity to human ADME characteristics The technical/practical feasibility to conduct the study in the selected species Advantages and disadvantages of using different rodent (rat, mouse) or non- rodent (rabbit, dog, minipig, NHP) species are outlined in Appendix A, Table A 6. While NHPs are p harmacologically relevant in many cases for biopharmaceuticals, the conduct of a JAS in NHPs prior to weaning can be challenging for both scientific and practical reasons (e.g., breeding/transport and management of dam/infant pairs). There is limited added value of performing a JAS in postweaning NHP. In postweaning NHPs , organ system maturity is generally beyond that relevant for many paediatric ages (see Appendix A). Only in rare cases is the value of a JAS conducted in preweaning NHP justifiable (e.g., intended neonatal paediatric use and inadequate exposure from an ePPND study). Therefore, alternative approaches are encouraged (also see S ection 4). Use of an available homologous protein, as discussed in ICH S6, can be considered for the purposes of hazard identification in the juvenile rodent or non- rodent species. JAS in two species can be warranted in a paediatric -first situation (see Section 4) or where there are multiple specific concerns for postnatal developmen t and one species alone is not able to address them. Biopharmaceuticals should only be assessed in pharmacologically relevant species, consistent with ICH S6. The conduct of a JAS in a second species to confirm findings in the first species is generally no t warranted. If an animal model of a paediatric disease exists (e.g., for enzyme replacement therapy ) and is being used to support pharmaceutical development , appropriate safety endpoints (e.g., histopathology, clinical pathology) can be incorporated in these studies. This information could contribute to the WoE evaluation, potentially providing sufficient information without conducting a dedicated JAS. 3.4 Age of A nimals, D osing Period , and D osing R egimen The age of animals at do sing initiation should developmentally correspond to the youngest intended pa tient age and will depend on a human- to-animal comparison of developmental periods of organ system(s) of toxicological concern. As comparative organ system correlations are not al igned for each organ across species, priority should be given to any target organ/ system of potential concern or to particularly vulnerable developing systems in the intended patient population. The animal age at dosing initiation should be justified using relevant information ( such as provided in A ppendix A ). In contrast to nonclinical studies for adult populations (see ICH M3), the recommended dosing period is not always directly related to the clinical treatment duration for the paediatric population. When determining the duration of administration in a JAS, it is important to consider the paediatric age range and the shorter developmental period of animals compared to humans , the safety concern for the intended paediatric population, and the relevant p eriod of organ development for the target organ of concern . Dosing in a JAS should usually occur during the critical and active periods of growth and development identified in the tables in Appendix A for a system of concern. ICH S11 Guideline 10 Thus, for example, a pharmaceutical with only the kidney as target organ of concern, could be supported with a rat JAS of limited duration focusing on the relevant period of renal development irrespective of the clinical treatment duration . Alternatively , even if the clinical treatment duration is short, a longer dosing period in animals can be appropriate to address concern s of organ system s that develop at different times or over an extended time. For example, a pharmaceutical with a CNS concern with a 10 -day clinical treatment duration intended for patients more than 2 years of age could be supported with a rat JAS with animals dosed from weaning to maturity (see Appendix A). If clinical treatment is intended through adolescence , dosing to maturity is typ ically conducted in rodents. The interval between birth and maturity for NHPs is several years, making dosing to maturity impractical. Furthermore, NHPs show considerable inter -individual variation in the age of onset of puberty and maturity. D osing up to maturity can, however , be possible in other typical non -rodent species when these species mature over a period of a few to several months and with relative consistency (e.g., minipig, see Appendix A) . The dosing regimen should be designed to achieve and ma intain relevant exposures during developmental periods of concern. Therefore, dosing regimens in a JAS may not be exactly the same as in the clinic. For example, even though a clinical regimen is once a week, more frequent dosing in juvenile animals might be more appropriate. If drug accumulation is a concern in juvenile animals, dosing could be less frequent than in adult toxicity studies (e.g., every other day vs. daily). When data demonstrate that animal s at different ages have different tolerability or exposures to the drug, dose adjustment over time can be considered to provide information with clinically relevant exposures at the appropriate developmental stages . If the duration of dosing is not expected to be tolerable in a JAS, it may be possible to achieve the clinically relevant exposure by separating the dosing period into different subgroups (e.g., a 6-week JAS dosing period is split into two subgroups of 3 weeks dosing , each starting at different ages). If subgroups with dif ferent dosing periods are used, all subgroups may need to be followed through to maturity to detect late effects. The benefits of this approach should be considered along with the drawbacks , such as substantially increasing the number of animals and diffic ulties interpreting data at different ages. 3.5 Post-Treatment Period Assessments Inclusion of an evaluation period after treatment has stopped in a JAS is generally recommended to help address two issues: 1) whether any effects observed during treatment are reversible, persistent , or progressive and 2) whether any effects emerge later in development as a result of early life exposure (i.e., delayed onset). Whether a post-treatment period is advisable is dependent on the outcome of the WoE assessment and the endpoints to be evaluated in the study. The principles of evaluation of the potential for reversibility in ICH M3 apply . The duration of the post-treatment period should be suffi cient to allow the potential recovery of the effect and should take into account the elimination of the pharmaceutical . However, t he demonstration of full reversibility is not considered essential. A trend towards reversibility ( e.g., decreased incidence and/or severity) and a scientific assessment that this would eventually progress to full reversibility could be sufficient. Likewise, if irreversibility of a specific effect is well characteri sed in adult animals, it is generally not necessary to confirm this in a JAS. There are endpoints in a JAS that are not ICH S11 Guideline 11 amenable to the classic approach of reversibility assessment, such as the timing of onset of puberty. Additionally, the timing of the post -treatment period in relation to the life stage of the animal s should be considered. If the post -treatment period begins prior to maturity, the capacity for recovery can be influenced by the continued growth and development of some organ systems and should be carefully interpreted. Some alterations can only be identified following an appropriate post -treatment period to allow maturation of an organ system and expression of the alteration. Therefore, some assessments can only be meaningfully performed after a certain level of maturity is reached (e.g., learning and memory , immunological function). These assessments can be conducted in post -treatment periods after exposure has covered all developmental windows relevant to the clinical use. This is especially relevant in cases when the JAS dosing duration would cease at an immature age and the animals will continue to mature during the post -treatment period to an age at which an appropriate assessment can be conducted. Conducting assessments in the post -treatment period can also address delayed onset changes that can be a result of early life exposure, especially in cases when the JAS dosing stops at an immature age. In non -rodents, depending on the species, the addition of post -treatment groups for a JAS is generally less useful due to the more protracted development period, high inter -individual variability, and fewer and less well -established assessments available to identify delayed or altered development (e.g., learning and memory tests) . 3.6 Route of Administration The intended clinical route of administration should be used when feasible, but obtaining adequate systemic exposure is paramount (see Section 3.7) . Alternative administration routes should be considered in cases of practical difficulties (e.g., use of oral route in preweaning rats for a dermal product ); changing routes during the course of the study can also be considered (e.g., subcutaneous injection until intravenous is feasible). The validity of using an alternative dosing route should be justified (e.g., supported by exposure data in representative juvenile animals). If the pharmaceutical is intended for use by two or more clinical routes of administration, a JAS with a single route of administration is sufficient but should provide adequate exposure in juvenile animals for all intended clinical routes of administration. 3.7 Dose Selection It is desirable to establish a dose -response relationship for adverse effects and to determine a no-observed adverse effect level ( NOAEL ) in juvenile animals. Dose level s should be selected to achieve some overlap in the range of exposure in adult animals to enable comparison of effects between young and adult animals. However , the high dose should not result in marked toxicity that can confound the growth and development endpoints and complicate the assessment. Body weight loss or lack of weight gain during rapid growth periods has the potential to confound results , and is therefore not desirable in a JAS. At least one dose should result in exposure levels similar to the anticipated exposure in the intended clinical population if tolerable . For small molecules, selection of the high dose in accordance with ICH M3 applies. For biotechnology -derived products, the principles for dose selection described in ICH S6 apply. ICH S11 Guideline 12 Dose adjustment (increase or decrease) during the course of a JAS should be considered in cases of substantial changes in systemic exposure due to maturation of the ADME systems . Adjusting doses is intended to keep the exposures somewhat consistent and clinically relevant. Generally, m ore than one dose adjustment during a JAS would not be expected. 3.8 Endpoints Generally, each JAS should include the core endpoints defined in Section 3.8.1 below . Each additional endpoint (see Section 3.8.2) should be considered and justified to address an identified safety concern . In some cases , such as a follow -up investigational JAS, all core endpoints might not be included when j ustified. The justification for including an endpoint should consider that invasive or prolonged procedures should be limited as much as possible during preweaning and at the time of weaning as they can contribute to mortality. 3.8.1 Core E ndpoints 3.8.1.1 Mortalit y and Clinical Observations Mortality should be evaluated throughout the experimental period. Clinical observations , including physical examinations , should be conducted both during treatment and post -treatment as they can identify overt behavioural effects . Clinical observations of the maternal animals should include assessment of nursing behaviour and maternal care of offspring when treatment of juvenile animals is initiated prior to weaning . Clinical observations can be different between suckling animals and adults and have different implications on the overall health status of the animal (e.g., hydration status, which reflects nutritional status in pups) . Therefore, clinical observations of offspring should also capture observations specific to suckling animals. After weaning, clinical observations should be recorded as is appropriate for adult animals. 3.8.1.2 Growth Growth should be assessed by body weights in conjunction with long bone length. As body weight increases dramatically during the early postnatal period, individual weight measurement s should be assessed at intervals appropriate for inform ing dose calculations . Generally, one long bone (e.g., femur) measured for length at necropsy is s ufficient (See Section 5 ). 3.8.1.3 Food Consumption Food consumption during the postweaning period should be assessed as appropriate for the species and housing conditions . 3.8.1.4 Sexual Development The physical indicators of onset of puberty (e.g. , for rodents , the age of vaginal opening in females and balanopreputial separation in males) are recommended when the study design encompasses the relevant developmental window. 3.8.1.5 Clinical Pathology Standard clinical pathology examinations ( clinica l chemistry and h aematology) should be assessed as a terminal endpoint at necropsy if evaluation is planned at an age at which clinical pathology ranges are known and can support interpretation of histopathology findings . ICH S11 Guideline 13 3.8.1.6 Anatomic Pathology At the end of the treatment and/or post -treatment periods, gross pathology, organ weights , and comprehensive collection and preservation of tissues should be conducted for animals allocated to necropsy . Microscopic evaluation should be performed on major organs (e.g., bone /marrow , brain, gastrointestinal tract, heart, kidney, liver , lung , ovary, testis with qualitative evaluation of spermatogenic progression in mature males ), those with macroscopic lesions and previously identified target organs. If a JAS is supporting first -in-paediatric trials (see S ection 4) then a standard set of tissues as used in adult toxic ity studies is recommended for histopathology. 3.8.1.7 Toxicokinetics When designing the TK component of a JAS, the use of microsampling and spa rse sampling (see ICH S3A) is strongly encouraged. Toxicokinetic sampling should be conducted near the beginning and end of the dosing period. If dosing is started preweaning , interim TK assessment(s) should be considered. If dose level s are adjusted during the study, additional sampling for TK is recommended. A DRF JAS with TK assessment (see Section 3.2) will inform on the sampling day and the timepoints of sample collection . The TK assessment should consider both active pharmaceutical ingredient and relevant major human metabolites. For biopharmaceuticals , samples for anti -drug antibodies should be collected, and evaluated if appropriate (see ICH S6). 3.8.2 Additional Endpoints t o Address Identified Concerns The decision to include additional endpoints should be based on the type and strength of the concern identified in the WoE evaluation. 3.8.2.1 Other Growth Endpoints As appropriate for the species , crown rump length, body length (e.g., nose/tail), and/or withers height can be used as an indicator of growth . Serial n on-invasive measurement s of long bone length using suitable imaging techniques (e.g., X -ray) can be useful in non -rodents in addition to a direct measurement at necropsy. 3.8.2.2 Bone Assessments When there is an identified concern specific to bone metabolism or structure, additional endpoints should be considered. Examples include assessments of bone mass and geometry using densitometric techniques, serum and urinary biomarkers of bone formation and resorption, and histomorphometry. Clinical Pathology Additional ha ematology , serum chemistry , and/or biomarker s can be considered to further characteri se identified target organ/tissue concern s. Other parameters such as urinalysis or coagulation assessments can be added when warranted and feasible . Due to the limitation in obtaining adequate sample volumes from juvenile animals (especially rodents), additional samples can require additional animals and, therefore , are only recommended when critical to address a concern. When sample volume constraints exist, the ICH S11 Guideline 14 parameters to be measured should be selected according to a priority based on the identified concern(s) . 3.8.2.4 Anatomic Pathology Additional tissues/organs can be evaluated to address specific concerns. Immunohistochemical or other special staining methods for tissue sections , elect ron microscopy , histomorphometry , or other imaging techniques can be further characteri sation when warranted . 3.8.2.5 Ophth ophthalmologic examinations (e.g., palpebral reflex, ophthalmoscopy) are not routine ly included in a JAS, because structural development of the eye is largely completed during the prenatal period in humans. However, when there is concern for ocular toxicity , assessment of ocular endpoints should be considered. 3.8.2.6 CNS Assessments There are different categories of CNS assessments, such as: detailed clinical observations behavioural tests learning and memory tests, and expanded neurohisto pathology evaluations. The selection of any additional CNS assessments should be based on concerns identified in the WoE evaluation. The timing of any such additional assessments within the JAS should take into consideration whether the results will be used to investigate adverse effects that are due to exaggerated pharmacology, developmental neurotoxicity (i.e., effects that are still present or emerge after the cessation of treatment), or both. If a compo und has a target in the CNS, the extent of distribution across the blood- brain barrier and which region of the brain is potentially affected (e.g., by target distribution and related functional pathways) should be considered. Such information, if known, ca n help inform selection of the appropriate additional CNS endpoints (e.g., when determining whether assessments of learning and memory or other endpoints are warranted ). Detailed clinical observations are a key component of CNS assessment and, therefore, s hould be assessed as appropriate throughout the study during the treatment and post -treatment periods . These observations should document the severity, the time of onset and the duration of the clinical signs relative to the time of dosing to determine whe ther or not effects are temporally associated with exposure . There are many different behavioural tests, including assessment of locomotor activity, evaluation of coordination and reflexes, and/or acoustic startle response (e.g., habituation or prepulse inhibition). The functional observational battery (FOB) or modified Irwin test are considered to have relatively low sensitivity in juvenile rodents and are of limited utility . The selected test(s) should be appropriate for the species being tested and the timing of these assessments should consider the level of maturity in the test species at the age of the assessment . Before deciding whether behavioural testing is performed du ring the treatment period, the potential for confounding pharmacological effects (e.g., sedation, decreased motor coordination) should be considered. ICH S11 Guideline 15 When specific aspects of learning and memory have been identified as areas of concern in the WoE evaluatio n, then an appropriate complex learning task capable of assessing such aspects should be selected. For evaluation of persistent or delayed effects on learning and memory, these assessments should be conducted in the post -treatment period. Postnatal CNS ass essments are most commonly conducted and characterised in the rodent. For those pharmaceuticals where the rodent is an inappropriate species, some behavioural tests are also available in other species (e.g., dogs, minipigs). In NHPs, behavioural observations in a JAS or ePPND study can provide an assessment of potential CNS effects. Learning assessments similar to those used in paediatric subjects have also been developed for NHPs, but these are infrequently conducted because of study design complexities and substantial interindividual variability. Lastly, any CNS regions or components (e.g., hippocampus, myelin) identified in the WoE evaluation as potential ly affected should be assessed with expanded neurohistopathological evaluations as appropriate (e.g. , additional sections examined, immunohistochemistry, special stains). These assessments are typically performed at the scheduled necropsy at the end of treatment and following a post -treatment period. Imaging technologies can also be useful in specific ci rcumstances. 3.8.2.7 Reproductive Assessments If there is an identified concern for effects on female and/or male reproductive organs or function, histopathology examinations and organ weights can be expanded to include reproductive and/or endocrine tissue s in addition to the gonads. It is not important to confirm in a JAS reproductive system effects that were identified as irreversible in adult animals. In rodents, for concerns relevant to females, assessment of estrous cyclicity is recommended for assessment of reproductive and endocrine function. For concerns relevant to male rodents, sperm analysis (e.g., counts, motility, morphology) and/or testicular immunohistochemistry (e.g., apoptosis) can be considered if of value to further characteri se effects. The timing of the treatment and assessments in relation to that of sexual maturation in the species tested is critical. The timing of folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis should be considered in the study design and timing of reproductive assessments . Assessment of reproductive organs or function (e.g., estrous cyclicity, sperm count, or qualitative histologic assessment of spermatogenesis) can only be conducted in sexually mature animals. If the clinical age range i ncludes prepubertal stages, there c an be a concern whether the pharmaceutical could cause any delayed effect on sexual maturation or reproductive function in adulthood. I f the clinical treatment is only during prepubertal stages , a JAS should be designed to treat only during immaturity, and then allow the animal to mature without further treatment and conduct assessments after maturation is reached. Mating assessments are not generally recommended in a JAS. Most effects on reproductive organs related to male fertility are detectable by histopathology . In female rodents, assessment of estrous cyclicity and ovarian histology can identify many developmental reproductive hazards . In dogs and NHPs , mating assessments are difficult due to the protracted duration of development and high degree of individual variability. Hormonal assessments are generally not recommended in a JAS as there is considerable variability in hormone level s, especially during puberty. Therefore, any hormonal assessment ICH S11 Guideline 16 should be justified, and the timing and specific hormones assessed should be well characteri sed for the age at which the assessment is conducted. The feasibility of reproductive assessments is such that the large majority are conducted in rodents, although they can be considered for those non- rodent species that achieve maturity during the conduct of a JAS. 3.8.2.8 Immun ologic Assessments If the pharmacological class or data in animals or humans gives cause for concern for the development of the i mmune system, assessments for immunotoxicity should be considered as outlined in ICH S8. Such concerns , when considered developmentally important, can include a transient , prolonged or permanent decrease or increase in the number or function of a lymphocyt e subtype , or a sustained increase or decrease in immunoglobulin class. Functional assays should be performed at appropriate stages of development , e.g., for T-Cell-Dependent Antibody Response ( TDAR ) after PND 45 for the rat. Confirmation of immunotoxicity is generally not warranted in a JAS if the toxicity is already well characteri sed. 3.9 Allocation of Animals to Study Groups and Endpoint Subsets 3.9.1 Preweaning Allocation A definitive JAS can become large and complex, therefore it is important that the study design balances scientific rigor against animal use. Before designing the study, investigators should know all the planned endpoints (core and additional). Efficiency in s tudy design is critical to reduce animal use as per the 3R principles and should be measured by the total number of maternal animals (and litters) needed to supply the study, including pups that ar e not used in standardi sed litters and pups that a re not as signed to specific endpoints . There are different allocation methods for litter management of multiparous non- rodent animals. For species with single offspring or small and variable litter sizes (e.g., NHP, dogs), group allocation design can be modelled f ollowing the principles applied in general toxicity studies. In most species, initiation of a JAS during the preweaning phase presents a unique situation for dosing offspring within a litter. Although the maternal animal is a critical component of the study providing nutrition and care, only the offspring are the test system. The study should be designed to reduce potential confounders . For JAS, maternal care and litter size are generally considered more important confounders than genetics. Reduction of confounding can be achieved by the way the litters are constructed and standardi sed in combination with how they are assigned to dose groups and how the individual pups are assigned to endpoints. When constructing study litters, select dams demonstratin g good maternal care and pups in apparent good health. It is advisable that study litters be standardised with respect to number of offspring and sex ratio (i.e., 4 to 5 pups/sex/litter in rats) at the same postnatal age. This can be accomplished by either fully fostering (arbitrarily mixing up all birth litters) or minimally fostering (keeping the birth litter as intact as possible and fostering only as necessary to obtain study litter size and sex ratio requirements). When feasible, standardise study litt ers at a time that allows some acclimation to the new litters prior to the first dose. As a change in litter size can alter pup growth rate, maintaining a consistent litter size across and within dose groups is recommended during the preweaning phase. ICH S11 Guideline 17 For assigning study animals to dose groups, it is preferred that each standardi sed litter be assigned to a single dose group to minimis e the risk for cross -contamination and to avoid treated and control offspring competing for suckling position and time. When assigning individual animals to endpoints in definitive studies, it is recommended that litter mates of the same sex not be assigned to the same endpoint to avoid maternal care biases (see Appendix C). The fostering approach, litter standardi sation, dose group, and endpoint allocation methods should be clearly described in the study plan/protocol and report. Appendix C provides a case study using one allocation approach for a rat JAS that minimis es potential for genetic, maternal care, and litter size con founders. There are other ways to successfully allocate litters, depending on the study objectives and endpoints, but other approaches should also consider and avoid these biases. 3.9.2 Postweaning Allocation In multiparous animal species, it is recommended to design the study with consideration of potential confounders when possible. In particular, when dosing starts in the early postweaning phase, and, when offspring are supplied from a limited number of natural mothers, the study should be desi gned in consideration of the potential confounders similar to those at preweaning allocation. 3.10 Animal Numbers and Sex A JAS should use a group size that is considered generally appropriate in a definitive toxicity study based on the selected endpoints (e.g., approximately 10 animals /sex for end -of-treatment necropsy endpoints similar to repeated -dose toxicity study for rats ). To reduce the number of animals, combining assessment of endpoints in the same subset of animals can be effective (See Appendix C). It is recommended that a JAS generally be performed in both fe male and male animals . 4 CONSIDERATIONS FOR PAEDIATRIC -FIRST/ONLY DEVELOPMENT A common clinical approach for the development of a paediatric- first/only pharmaceutical starts with a First in Human (FIH) study in healthy adult volunteers prior to any paediatric trial. As per ICH M3, this approach generally includes repeat ed-dose toxicity studies in rodent and non-rodent animals , as well as safety pharmacology and genetic toxicology studies. The principles of ICH S6 can also apply. The toxicity studies to support the FIH adult study could be performed as standard repeat ed-dose toxicity studies in two species . Alternatively, one or both of these studies could be initiated in juvenile animals , and treatment can be continued into maturity in some species (see Section 3.4) . Studies in juvenile animals should include additional relevant endpoints (see Section 3.8) . The approach that includes juvenile animals can be more efficient , as it c ould support initiation of clinical trials in paediatric patients shortly after the adult FIH study. There are cases , however, where paediatric patients are treated without any prior adult patient or healthy volunteer data (e.g., for a life -threatening or debilitating disease that only exists in children or when the pharmaceutical cannot be given safely to adult volunteers). In these cases , the FIH trial w ould be in paediatric patients and the nonclinical program would generally include one JAS in a rodent and one JAS in a non-rodent species . Safety pharmacology and ICH S11 Guideline 18 genotoxicity testing would be conducted as appropriate for adult use , although these studies need not be conducted in juvenile animals (see Section 2.3.4) . If the pharmaceutical is intended to treat a chronic pa ediatric disease, chronic toxicity studies should be conducted in one rodent and one non- rodent species . In at least one of these studies , dosing should start at an age developmentally matched to the lowest age of the inte nded patient population. In principle, chronic studies that start dosing from ages that developmentally correlate to the youngest paediatric patient age can be sufficient to cover all ages and durations of paediatric use. These can replace adult animal chronic studies and a separate JAS. Further nonclinical assessments of reproducti ve toxicity and carcinogenic potential can be warranted. When studies in juvenile animals are warranted for biopharmaceuticals , these should be limited to relevant species, as per ICH S6. Non-invasive safety pharmacology endpoints can be included in the juvenile or standard NHP repeated- dose studies. Genotoxic and carcinogenic potential should be addressed as outlined in ICH S6. A JAS in postweaning NHP is typically conducted in animals starting at 10 to 12 months of age, thus limiting the coverage of the lowest paediatric age ranges. A JAS in preweaning NHP should only be conducted in the situation of pharmaceuticals with first and primarily neonatal clinical use, and where al ternative approaches to nonclinical safety assessment are not feasible. Studies with direct dosing of NHPs prior to weaning can require large numbers of mature dams to populate even a relatively small JAS . Therefore, the design and endpoints should be clea rly justified based on the clinical concern. Design expectations should also be flexible because, for example, variability in sex distribution and starting weights of offspring is expected. In cases where a JAS is not feasible to support the youngest paedi atric age, alternative approaches (e.g., in vitro assays, genetically -modified animal models, surrogate molecules) should be considered if available and relevant. Section 3 should be consulted to determine study designs. 5. DATA INTERPRETATION 5.1 Considerations for Endpoint Interpretation Many observations in a JAS (e.g., body weight, clinical pathology) are age, sex and species/strain dependent. Age -matched concurrent control data are, therefore, critical for interpretation. If available, appropr iate historical control data or reference materials (e.g., tissue database or atlas) can also be helpful to interpret results , especially in cases of low incidence findings or unscheduled early deaths (i.e., when control data are often lacking or insuffici ent). Interpretation of clinical observations can differ between juvenile and adult animals and assessments in preweanlings should also consider maternal care and the overall health status of the litter. An assessment on growth should typically be consi dered a key objective of a definitive JAS and should preferably be conducted at necropsy by an evaluation of long bone length in conjunction with body weight , and food intake if available . The latter parameters are needed to differentiate between potential direct effect s on skeletal development or indirect effects (secondary to toxicity causing malnutrition and body weight loss/decrease) on long bone length. An effect solely on decreased body weight gain is not necessarily an effect on growth. Frequent assessments of long bone length for 'transient' effects on growth are challenging to interpret ICH S11 Guideline 19 and offer limited value because of the inter -individual variability in growth rate during development. Assessment of organ weight data and the onset of sexual devel opment should be performed in the context of growth. Organ weight changes are not always proportional to body weight changes because some organs grow at different rates throughout development (i.e., allometric versus isometric growth) . Additionally, organs have different sensitivity to growth effects (e.g., the brain can be less affected than other organs). Thus, interpretation of absolute and relative organ weights should consider these aspects. For statistical analysis, data collected from offspring while part of a study litter should not be considered an independent variable (see ICH S5). 5.2 Overall Interpretation An integrated assessment should be made across all appropriate studies , compar ing available findings in juvenile and adult animals, and evaluat ing clinical relevance. Relevant findings in juvenile animals not observed in adults should be discussed , as well as any marked differences in sensitivity compared to adults . The overall interpretation of relevant findings should consider the type , severity and recovery (if known) of the effect s, the age of the animals and the exposures and/or doses at which any effects were observed , and relate these to the intended paediatric use . 6. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 6.1 Excipients Pharmaceutical formulations occasionally contain excipients for which only limited experience exists in paediatric populations. To assess the safety of the excipients in a paediatric clinical formulation, available information on the excipients should be evaluated and a WoE approach should be followed (see S ection 2) . If there are insufficient data to support the use of the excipient in the intended paediatric population, further safety evaluation can be warranted , for example, an additional group evaluating the excipient alone in a JAS. 6.2 Combination Pharmaceuticals The development of combination pharmaceuticals for paediatric use should have a nonclinical evaluation consistent with the principles outlined in ICH M3 for combination products in general , together with the WoE principles outlined in this guideline . Consequently, a JAS of a combination pharmaceutical should be considered only if previous human and animal data are determined to be insufficient to support paediatric development , and the WoE evaluation suggests that a JAS would address identified concerns . If additional nonclinical information is warranted , the study design should consider which endpoints are appropriate to address any concerns of administering the particular combination. If a JAS is considered appropriate, assessment of the combination as it is to be used clinically might be sufficient and testing of the individual active ingredients m ight not be critical . Alternatively, an extra group with the combination could be added to a JAS that is already being conducted with one of the single entities . This could provide information that would otherwise be obtained in a separate study with the combi nation product. ICH S11 Guideline 20 GLOSSARY Allometric and isometric growth Isometric growth occurs when proportional relationships are preserved as size changes during growth. Allometric growth is any deviation from isometric growth. With allometric growth, properties such as bone length, organ weight and body surface area can change according to an exponential function of body mass. Endpoint Subset : A set of individual animals within a dose group that are assigned to the same endpoint. Enhanced Pre - and Postnatal Development Study (ePPND): This study design is based on biopharmaceutical experience , often in NHP, and is a PPND study which includes elements of the embryofetal development (EFD) study in newborns and infants instead of the fetus. Fostering: The act of nurturing or offering parental care to offspring that are not genetically related. The fully fostering technique arbitrarily mixes up litters with the intent not to have dams with their genetic pups. The minimally fostering t echnique retains the natural litter as intact as possible , fostering only as necessary to achieve desired litter size and sex ratio. Juvenile Animal : An animal in any postnatal stage not fully matured in terms of organ or system morphology and function. Juvenile Animal Study (JAS) - A nonclinical safety study typically conducted with the objective to provide a n assessment of the toxicity profile of a pharmaceutical in juvenile animals. Paediatric- First Development : Paediatric- first development describes development for treatment of paediatric patients before any development for an adult indication. Paediatric- Only Development : Paediatric- only development describes development for treatment exclusively in paediatric ages (e.g., neonatal respiratory distress syndrome). Weight of Evidence: An approach that evaluates information from several sources to de cide if there is sufficient evidence to support the development of pharmaceuticals for paediatric use or whether additional nonclinical testing is warranted to address potential safety concerns . The weight given to the available evidence depends on factors such as the quality of the data, consistency of results, nature and severity of effects, and relevance of the information. The weight of evidence approach requires use of scientific judgment and, therefore, should consider the robustness and reliability of the different data sources. ICH S11 Guideline 21 REFERENCES 1.

The tables are intended to aid in the assessment of the relevance of existing nonclinical data, as well as the selection of species, starting age, and dosing duration for a JAS. They are based on a review of current knowledge, but are not comprehensive. Species -specific and/or organ system reviews in the literature can provide additional detail and should be consulted for each specific situation . Factors such as strain, breeding, and animal supplier can impact age- dependent development and should also be considered. The following legend applies to Tables A1- A5 and Figure A1 : Critical period of structural and functional growth and development Active period of growth and/or functional maturation Slow continued growth and/or refinement of function Structurally and functionally fully mature The human age categories are aligned with those described in the ICH E11 guideline , with approximate milestones (e.g. birth, introduction of solid foods, weaning, puberty, and adulthood) corresponding to development in nonclinical species. The tables only provide an approximation of the ages when these milestones occur. For example, the active developmental period of several organ systems can last until 12 or 18 months of age in humans, which coincides with the regionally and culturally diverse milestones of introduction of solid food and weaning in humans. Develop mental toxicity is of particular concern during critical and active periods of functional and structural growth and less so during periods of slow growth or refinement of function. In some organ systems, such as the immune system, the tissues are largely c ompetent to respond at birth, but then undergo substantial expansion in the immediate postnatal period in parallel with environmental stimulation. Likewise, some organ systems such as the CNS are highly complex, with different timelines for establishment o f reflexes, pain pathways, sleep patterns, myelination, coordination and cognitive function. This complexity can influence periods of susceptibility during development, so the milestones listed provide only a general guide. Functional maturation occurs int o adulthood in humans for some aspects of CNS development, and cannot be fully modelled by animal test systems. Puberty is a period of intense endocrine activity with important structural and functional maturation of the reproductive system, but also with effects on musculoskeletal growth and CNS development in humans. The timing of puberty can be variable across all species, particularly in primates, where onset and progression are typically monitored by external sex characteristics, as in Tanner staging i n humans. Females typically achieve full reproductive functionality prior to males across species. Finally, slow continued growth with refinement of function occurs into adulthood for several organ systems, as is indicated in the tables.

Principal Advantages and Disadvantages of Various Mammalian Species for Use in Juvenile Animal Studies Species Advantages Disadvantages Rat Well -studied species in juvenile animal studies with extensive historical control data Several consistent developmental milestones (general growth, preputial separation/vaginal opening, puberty) Often used for (adult) general and reproductive toxicology Body size allows most manipulations/administrations starting early preweaning Litter size allows balanced sex distribution and allocation of pups to different e ndpoints and dedicated cohorts of pups Compressed development (~10 weeks) allows for inclusion of wide range of endpoints Compressed development allows for inclusion of additional endpoints which are difficult to perform using large animals (such as devel opmental neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, fertility/breeding) Small body weight requiring low amount of test material Relatively easy transportation, housing and management Pups and dams are amenable to fostering Easy to obtain many pups with the same post natal stage Passive immunity present at birth Small body size, high metabolic rate and rapid growth can lead to fast decline in general condition and death Several organ systems are less developed at birth relative to man (particularly CNS, lung, kidney, G I tract and immune system; eyes do not open until PND 12 -14) ADME characteristics of oral pharmaceuticals given in the preweaning phase often translate poorly to humans due to immaturity of the GI tract Compressed development can make it difficult to identify distinct windows of vulnerability Conventional blood samples are often terminal collections, particularly preweaning Can easily become very large studies as most endpoints or collections require dedicated cohorts of pups Less sensitive tha n humans to fertility perturbations Can have more limited application for foreign proteins Often not pharmacologically relevant for highly targeted therapies Potential impact of immunogenicity Mouse Advantages are generally similar to those of the rat, but postnatal development occurs slightly faster Broad CYP enzymes; metabolism can be more relevant than rat for some compounds Mice have a gall bladder (unlike rats) Detailed literature available, especially for development and characteri sation of the CNS and immune system Similar to rat, additionally: Small pup size allows fewer manipulations /administrations than rat from early on Requires dedicated cohorts of pups for each endpoint or collection and can require sample pooling Less historical background information than the rat ICH S11 Guideline 30 Species Advantages Disadvantages Many genetic modification models available including some models that increase pharmacological relevance for highly targeted therapies Dog Often used in general (adult) toxicology Relatively large at birth Relatively easy to handle Litter size allows allocation of pups to different endpoints Puppies can be separated from dams for a few hours Breeding can be planned in advance Postnatal development of several organ systems reasonably comparable to that of human infants (cardiovascular, pulmonary, immune system) CNS maturation relatively well characteri sed, with defined critical window for learning/cognitive development Protracted development (~5 -12 months to sexual maturity, 12 -18 months to skeletal maturity) with inter individual variability in growth and developmental milestones Altricial at birth (i.e., eyes do not open and cannot bear weight until ~ 2 weeks postnatally) Require colostrum for passive transfer of maternal Ig in immediate perinatal period Variable litter sizes and sex distribution can make it difficult to populate study with minimal bias (genetic/litter, sex distribution) across groups Limited historical background data, especially for nonstandard endpoints Seasonal breeder (supply & study start over wee ks or months) Not amenable to fostering Large body size requires comparably large amounts of test compound compared to rodents Minipig/ Pig Many similar developmental milestones as humans Relatively large at birth Relatively easy to handle Breeding can be planned in advance Litter size allows allocation of piglets to different endpoints Amenable to fostering Relatively large litters usually allow balanced sex distribution Neonatal GI tract similar to human for orally administered drugs All routes of administration feasible (except inhalation); best model for dermal studies (low density of adnexa and hair follicles, similar thickness of epidermis) Less well -established historical control data than dog or NHP toxicology species Require colostrum for passive transfer of maternal Ig in immediate perinatal period Some organ systems relatively mature at birth compared to human infants (e.g., lungs, musculoskeletal) Large body size requires comparably large amounts of test compound compared to rodents IV and gavage administration can be challenging in very young piglets ICH S11 Guideline 31 Species Advantages Disadvantages Short development (~6 -9 months), relatively easy transport and housing compared to other large non- rodents NHP Usually cynomolgus but rhesus and marmosets also feasible Many similar developmental milestones as humans Neonates/infants similar to human for GI tract, immune system, cardiovascular, renal and special sense (eye, ear) development Macaque infants are relatively large at birth Extensive reference and historical backgr ound data from birth available Often used for (adult) general and reproductive toxicology (e.g., ePPND), especially for biopharmaceuticals Maternal transfer of immunoglobulin is similar to humans, so infants are born with passive immunity (serum IgG) Often the most pharmacologically relevant animal model for highly targeted therapies Protracted development (~3 -6 years for sexual maturity, ~5 -8 years for skeletal maturity in macaques) makes an extensive juvenile study to cover all developmental phases im practical Single offspring for macaques with high inter -individual variability in growth and development Marmosets typically have twins and require both maternal and paternal care in preweaning phase; offspring are relatively small Offspring highly dependent on maternal care over first month (minimal procedural intervention recommended; preweaning manipulation & dosing feasible with risk of maternal rejection), and are cohoused with dam for first 3 -6 months; with shipping and quarantine requirements it is rarely feasible to initiate studies in juvenile monkeys < 9 months of age Neonatal NHP are precocious relative to human neonates in terms of musculoskeletal, CNS, endocrine and respiratory system Cannot synchronise breeding (supply & study start ove r weeks or months for seasonal breeders such as rhesus) Ethical reservations (strong rationale to justify use of juvenile NHP for toxicity testing) Rabbit Compressed development (~5 -6 months) and small body size requiring comparably low amount of test material Relatively easy to handle Often used for reproductive toxicology; can also be used for ocular administration, evaluation of bone growth Litter size allows balanced sex distribution and allocation of kits to different endpoints Relatively easy transport and housing Passive immunity present at birth Developmental milestones less well established than other non -rodent species Not routinely used/well accepted in (adult) general toxicology Less well -established historical control data than dog or NHP toxicology species Handling young offspring can provoke cannibalism or rejection by the mother Limitations similar to rat for foreign proteins, and immunogenicity can lead to acute hypersensitivity reactions ICH S11 Guideline 32 Species Advantages Disadvantages Sensitive to gastrointestinal disturbances General physical condition difficult to monitor using clinical signs Other Species Other species could be considered for cause when pharmacologically and toxicologically relevant. Examples of alternative mamm alian test systems include the hamster, guinea pig, tree shrew, ferret, cat, sheep and goat. Advantages tend to be species and pro gram specific, but often reflect use of that species in genetic or disease models, or when there are data supporting interpretation and translatability of specific endpoints. Disadvantages include: Developmental milestones less well established than in rat, mouse, dog, minipig/pig and NHP Not routinely used / well accepted in (adult) general toxicology Limited historical control toxicology data Limited use (model in special indications such as heart failure) Many require colostrum for passive transfer of maternal Ig in perinatal period Limited availability of purpose -bred animals and suitable laboratory housing ICH S11 Guideline 33 APPENDIX B: CASE STUDIES APPLYING THE WEIGHT OF EVIDENCE APPROACH A. A small molecule with known pharmacology has available adult clinical and nonclinical data including repeated -dose toxicity data. None of these data suggest a safety concern in a developing organ for the intended paediatric population of adolescents (12 years and above) for a one -month duration of clinical treatment. The WoE analysis indicates that additional nonc linical investigations will not contribute useful information.

A small molecule with a novel mode of action intended for chronic use starting in neonates or infants has limited Phase 1 clinical and nonclinical safety data with no significant safety concerns identified. There are potential effects on developing organ systems based on the pharmacology . The WoE analysis indicates further nonclinical investigation, such as a JAS with additional endpoints based on the targeted developing organ systems, would be useful.

A small molecule with a pharmacolog ical target that has a n established critical role in CNS development is intended for chronic use in children (6 years and above) . Nonclinical and adult clinical data are available. The concern for a potential effect on the developing CNS cannot be addressed clinically by monitoring and management. Existing data adequately address other developing systems. The WoE analysis warrants a postweaning JAS design that includes core endpoints and additional CNS endpoints to address the specific concern.

A monoclonal antibody targets a soluble cytokine and is intended for chronic paediatric use in rheumatologic and allergic diseases (>2 years old). The only findings are reversible decreased serum Ig and occasional injection site reactions (in both animals and adult patients). In a monkey ePPND study, offspring exposure was comparable to dams through PND 28 and decreased there after. T-cell-dependent antibody response (TDAR) results were similar to controls (between 3 -6 months postnatally). The WoE analysis does not warrant a JAS.

This can be achieved by how the study litters are constructed and standardi sed in combination with how the study litters are assigned to dose groups and how the individual pups are assigned to endpoint subsets. See also Section 3.9.1. One approach to achieve the goal of an even distribution of potential confounders is to standardi se the litter using a minimal fostering technique in which the majority of pups remain with their natural mother (i.e., those pups in good health) a nd, when necessary, a small number of pups are fostered into the litter to achieve the desired litter size and sex ratio assign each standardi sed whole litter to a single dose group assign individual pups within the study litter to endpoint subsets In the following example, the definitive rat JAS design has a dosing interval from PND 14 through 63 and includes assessments of both core endpoints ( with TK assessments on PND 14, 22, and 63) and study -specific additional endpoints (post -treatment necropsy and CNS assessments). Each dose group contains 10 minimally fostered rat litters (identified as A, B, C for each dam with a litter, etc.). The litters a re standardi sed to 10 pups per litter (5 male and 5 female pups when possible) with each colored line in the figure representing an individual pup. The genetic offspring a re assigned arbitrarily ( F1, F2, etc. for the first and second female, respectively). Pups that were fostered are re- assigned the 'last' positions in the pup identification scheme (e.g., F5 for the fifth female) . The dam identifiers for both their genetic (if available) and foster mothers are recorded in the study data. The whole litter i s then assigned to the same dose group so all 10 pups in a litter will be treated with the same dose. General ly, the number of litters will depend on the total number of pups for the selected endpoints . Microsampling can minimis e the number of animals for TK assessment, and thus is always encouraged. In this example, the pups a re assigned to core and study -specific additional endpoints across the 10 litters in an inter -litter fashion (i.e., one or two male s and/or female s from each litter to the specific endpoint subset). The end- of-treatment necropsy and other key endpoints a re assigned to pups with low ide ntification numbers (i.e., M1 or M2) so that fostered pups are more likely assigned to endpoints less affected by confounders . Depending on the specific study endpoints, there are different ways that the subsets can be allocated to accomplish the same objectives . ICH S11 Guideline 38 Figure Represents One Dose Group of 10 litters with 5 pups/sex Males Females A B C D E F G H I JM1 M2 M3 timepoints, terminal) In this example, one pup/sex/litter is allocated for the end -of-treatment necropsy ( M1/F1 blue lines; for a total of 10 pups/sex/dose group). T he 10 pups/sex/dose group of the second set (M2/F2 half yellow and green lines) are assigned to two assessments, CNS behavioural assessments and post -treatment necropsy. These 10 pups/sex/dose group along with the 10 pups/sex/dose group of the third set ( M3/F3 green lines) are combined for a total subset of 20 pups/sex/dose g roup for the CNS behaviour assessment. This CNS assessment includes detailed clinical observations, behaviour tests, and learning and memory tests, which can be conducted during the post -treatment period with clinical observations also conducted during treatment. Both of the necropsy subsets (end- of-treatment and post -treatment) include an expanded neuropathology assessment. The fourth set (M4/F4 red lines) is assigned to the PND 63 TK subset (serial sampling ; non-terminal serial sampling is possible in post -weaning rats of this age , therefore only a portion of this subset is needed for TK and could be used for other assessments ). Because maternal and litter confounders would not be relevant for a single dose TK assessment, the TK blood samples after the first dose on PND 14 are collected from spare litters (not shown) that would not continue on study after the blood collection (approximately 3 -4 pups/timepoint/dose group). Lastly , 1 pup/sex/litter (M5/F5 black lines) is assigned to the PND 22 TK subset (a n age that typically requires terminal blood collection unless microsampling is available). The pups in the end- also have core assessments for post -weaning food consumption, se xual development, clinical pathology, and long bone length. The core endpoints of mortality, clinical observations, and body weights are assessed for all pups. ICH S11 Guideline 39 In addition to the example above, t here are other options that can decrease the number of pups assigned to the study . For instance, one set of 10 pups/sex/dose group could be split to serial sampling TK (4 pups/sex/dose group) and post -treatment necropsy (6 pups/sex/dose group). Alternatively, in the example above , the fourth set of 10 pups/sex/dose group ( M4/F4) could be split into 4 pups/sex/dose group for the PND 63 TK assessment (an age when non- terminal serial blood collections are generally feasible) and 6 pups/sex/dose group for the CNS assessment. The third set of 10 pups/sex/dos e group ( M3/F3 green lines) could also be assigned to the CNS subset to achieve a total of 16 pups/sex/dose group. Both of these options obviate the need for extra animals for the CNS assessments. Thoughtful study designs which include appropriate endpoint s and animal allocation can minimis e the number of litters and total animal s used. "}
