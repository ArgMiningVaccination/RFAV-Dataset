CooneyEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2015 III EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016 III From the President's Desk: Member service and value initiatives break from the gate Greetings! By the time you receive this edition of EVE, many of you will be plunged into spring work and 2016 will be rolling forward at a rapid pace. Precisely the same pace exists within your organiza-tion on all levels: board, committees, task forces, members, staff and, of course, myself. Key discus-sions focus on unpacking the strategic plan objectives for 2016 in the five areas: Communications: A com- munication assessment to be completed by the end of the second quarter will help to guide increased user friendliness and efficiency of our website, timeliness of AAEP communication about industry issues, and possible introduction of apps for members. Membership Value: AAEP Touch will continue to roll out initiatives that help you strengthen your relationships with clients. The newest resource\u2014the \"Difficult Conversations\" video series\u2014debuted in January, and we will be exploring the expansion of the Touch program to veterinary technicians with the goal of creating more access to these valuable client tools for everyone in your practice. The AAEP will also be investigating additional opportunities to create cost savings for members on the products and services used every day in practice. Wellness: AAEP will be participating in the March AVMA Wellness Round Table to delve into veterinary-related wellness issues. Our 2015 convention keynote speaker Dr. Dan Siegel scratched the surface of wellness with equine practitioners; and we will continue in 2016 to work to develop resources and recognition to assist with work-life balance and members' physical and mental health. Promotion of the Profession: AAEP will expand its outreach to other industry stakeholders on the value of the equine veterinarian. We will partner with our many stake-holders within breed and discipline organizations, equine industry groups and various media outlets to promote why using equine practitioners is better for the health and welfare of the horse versus the perceived value horse owners may feel is provided by using lay individuals.Education: The 2015 CE Needs Analysis survey enabled AAEP members to declare the medical topics of most importance to them. Although the rankings were similar to the results from 2010, the topic of business management was differentiated by stage of practice life; and ethics was identified as an important topic, with interest in case-based ethical dilemma panel discussions. This rolls nicely into the 2016 convention, which will feature business sessions on the topic of \"Transitions,\" an ethics keynote speaker and a later session of panel Q&A on ethical practice scenarios. Other areas of action:AAEP: The AAEP has formed an economic task force to collaborate with AVMA to release a 2016 survey identify-ing economic factors of equine practice that can be addressed to improve our members' economic health\u2014employment, debt and business models, including client-patient differences. Be sure to participate when you receive this e-mail survey request. Economics of Veterinary Medical Education Summit: AAEP will participate in this student debt discussion in April at Michigan State University to seek to identify action steps to address this concern that impacts our profession at all levels. Equine Disease Communication Center: The EDCC and the AAEP Foundation's EDCC advisory subcommittee will be supported by a newly formed AAEP Infectious Diseases Committee charged with monitoring and updating disease information for both www.aaep.org and www.equinediseasecc.org. EIPH Research Initiative: Findings will facilitate collabo- ration of leading research scientists and funding sources in a quest for a united stakeholder focus on this pivotal piece of performance horse health. Rounds: There have been some great discussions and cases presented in the online Rounds this year. If you have not visited your area of interest, I encourage you to \"lurk\" or contribute as we all benefit from this participation. To conclude, AAEP remains actively engaged in many actions with you, the member, as the primary focus. Stay tuned and let us know if there is more we can do. Parting thought: \"The greatest danger to our future is apathy.\" \u2014Jane Goodall Dr. Kathleen Anderson By Kathleen Anderson, DVMIV EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016 Warm sun and turquoise Caribbean waters greeted the 78 practitioners and their guests who ventured to the island paradise of Barbados for the AAEP's 18th Annual Resort Symposium, Jan. 25-27. The small, relaxed nature of the meeting provided an ideal setting for interactive discussions and consumption of diagnostics, treatments and techniques in the areas of equine dentistry, foal medicine and lameness in the per-formance horse. Meanwhile, sunny weather and tempera-tures in the 80s made sunscreen a priority for afternoon group excursions or simply lounging around the pool or beach. If you missed your chance at a laid-back, tropical recess from practice this winter, you'll have another opportunity to feel the sand between your toes in early 2017 at a location to be announced in an upcoming issue. The AAEP thanks IDEXX, Luitpold Animal Health and Merial for their sponsorship of the 18th Annual Resort Symposium and support of equine continuing education.Resort Symposium attendees fuse sun and science in Barbados Birgit Hofman, left, and Dr. Sophia Parzer traveled from Germany to attend the Resort Symposium in Barbados. Touch Point: 'Getting to Know the Sport' videos help you learn your client's business If your client is a competitor or a professional horseperson who makes his or her living in the horse industry, your expertise about the sport or breed in which they're involved is important to their satisfaction with your services. According to the AAEP's market research, owners who are satisfied with their veterinarians are substantially more likely than those who aren't satisfied to say that their vet-erinarian \"understands my business.\"Of the 19 attributes tested in our research with owners and trainers, \"my veterinarian understands my business\" was among those with the largest difference in ratings between the satisfied and the dissatisfied. Gaining the necessary expertise about your client's business can be as easy as attending a horse show or researching a discipline on the Internet. It just requires the willingness to learn more about the things most important to your clients.Get started by watching the Touch program's video series, \"Getting to Know the Sport,\" featuring the newest videos on the discipline of Standardbred racing. The series provides an introduction to several disciplines within equine sport and offers advice from an experi-enced veterinarian and trainer in each discipline. All Touch resources are available exclusively to AAEP members at touch.aaep.org. EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016 V Cervical spine issues are more common than realized, particularly in sport horse and Western perfor-mance disciplines. However, a definitive diagnosis of the source of neck pain can challenge even the mid- to high-level practitioner, especially when distinguishing between axial and peripheral pain. The AAEP's 360\u00b0 Pain in the Neck - What's the Story From Anatomy to Treatment will immerse you in an interactive, small-group exploration of neck problems, with a focus on in-the-field, hands-on diagnostics and therapeutic modalities. Diagnostics will include X-rays and ultrasound along with exploration of the use and timeliness of advanced imaging. Therapeutic modalities will range from rehabilitation and physical exercises to joint injections and injections around problem areas. Afternoon wet labs using cadavers and normal horses will supplement morning lectures and instill confidence and proficiency in understanding the anatomy, imaging the anatomy, diagnosing different pathologic findings and administering treatment. On the final day, you will put your newly acquired skills to the test by working up unknown clinical cases on real horses to arrive at the correct diagnosis and treatment on your own. This unique, high-end course is limited to 20 participants to create an exceptional learning experience. The faculty encompasses leading authorities from both private practice and academia in the areas of anatomy, imaging, clinical and alternative therapies. Evening social events with the instructors will facilitate further discussions and formation of enduring professional relationships. 360\u00b0 Pain in the Neck - What's the Story From Anatomy to Treatment will be held June 19-22 at Colorado State University, which is on the forefront of axial pain management. Early registration is encouraged due to the limited attendance of this meeting. Registration will open soon at www.aaep.org/info/360-neck, from which you can acquire additional information about the meeting. 360\u00b0 Pain in the Neck - What's the Story From Anatomy to Treatment is sponsored by:Take a 360\u00b0 approach to neck problems at summer CE meeting AAEP student members and recent graduates in their first year of practice or internship are invited to submit case pre-sentations to be featured as educational resources on the AAEP website.

Dr. Cynthia MacKenzie and I represented the AAEP at the HoD meeting, with AAEP President Dr. Kathleen Anderson, AAEP Leadership Development Committee Chair Dr. Rachel Cezar, AAEP Executive Director David Foley and emerging leader Dr. Brad Tanner also in attendance for the conference.Two resolutions on behalf of the profession were considered during the HoD meeting. The first concerned revision of the AVMA policy on Free-roaming Abandoned and Feral Cats. Dr. MacKenzie and I carefully considered the AAEP position on this amendment in attending our Allied Caucus Meeting prior to the HoD Session, with particular focus on proposed language relating to the optional use of euthanasia in certain situations to control population numbers and protect interests of animal and public health. We voted in favor of this resolution due to its alignment with the AAEP position on euthanasia in addressing the unwanted horse issue. The resolution passed.The other considered resolution pertained to communica-tion by HoD members with their AVMA-member constitu-ents who may not belong to their state VMA. The approved resolution addresses concerns of HoD members that they may not be reaching all AVMA members in their state when they use state VMA contacts. The plenary session included the rebranding of AVMA GHLIT as AVMA LIFE, which you are encouraged to evaluate for your personal insurance needs as a member benefit of AVMA at www.avmalife.org; and recognition of the 50th anniversary of the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges, which is presided over by AAEP Past President Dr. Eleanor Green, dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at Texas A&M University. Following the meeting, we learned of the impending retirement of Dr. Ron DeHaven as executive vice president and CEO of the AVMA in summer 2016. He has been a good friend to the AAEP over the years, and we wish him well in his retirement. As always, Dr. MacKenzie and I appreciate the privilege to represent the AAEP and its members within the HoD. Please reach out to us if we can ever answer any questions or address any concerns you might have relative to the AAEP's role in shaping policy for the profession at the AVMA.

Kent Carter at the 61st Annual Convention in Las Vegas, Nev.VIII EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016 Legacy gift repays horse and profession for rewarding career Dr. Stuart Brown, partner at Hagyard Equine Medical Institute in Lexington, Ky., is fulfilling his childhood goal to practice equine veterinary medicine in his native Central Kentucky. From his formative teenage years to this day, the AAEP and its members have been of direct and indirect consequence by offering encouragement, mentorship, leadership opportunities and, when needed most, compassion and support. When reassessing life's priorities following a personal loss, Dr. Brown decided to invest long-term in support of the horse and veterinary medicine by pledging a portion of his estate to the AAEP Foundation and becoming a member of its Legacy Society. Dr. Brown recently discussed his bequest and emphasized the enduring influence that planned gifts to the Foundation will have on the welfare of the horse, the profession and AAEP members. Describe the important role horses have played in your life\u2014both personally and professionally. I have been actively involved with horses since the age of 13 working in the Thoroughbred industry. Through those experiences, I was befriended by several of the principals of Hagyard, Davidson and McGee who took an interest in my path toward becoming an equine practitioner. Coupled with the mentorship of many of the leading central Kentucky horsemen who were clients of HDM, the lessons learned have led to the realization of my goal to practice equine veterinary medicine in that region. Throughout, the sustaining passion for all things about the health and care of the horse has been central to all of my life relation-ships from professional to personal. Is there an important moment, person or special reason connected with AAEP that may have influenced your decision to include the AAEP Foundation in your estate plans? I have had the good fortune to be mentored by several of my colleagues through my involvement with the AAEP. These relationships have been the cornerstone of my involvement in organized veterinary medicine and set a course for me toward servant leadership in our profession. When I experienced the sudden loss of my wife Christine, these people from my AAEP family were the ones who provided support and encouragement through that event. Their lessons in support of AAEP and its members go beyond the call. From your perspective, how has the work of the AAEP Foundation influenced the welfare of the horse? The Foundation has provided the key contributions to timely research needed by equine practitioners to care for their patients. It has assisted in the mission of helping horses around the world through its Equitarian projects. Finally, the support of scholarships continues to allow the AAEP to invest in the next generation of practitioners who will become the future of our AAEP. What legacy do you hope to leave through your estate gift? My hope is that a planned gift will further the already strong mission of the AAEP Foundation. Its structure represents a sustainable model of engagement by its members, working with a dedicated staff that gives me confidence in its direction and inspires me to support beyond my lifetime. I am also hopeful that my actions might inspire others to consider joining me in incorporating the AAEP Foundation into their estate planning. If you'd like, talk about the steps, considerations or thought process that went into your planning. Honestly, as I reflected on my personal situation after the loss of my wife, I began to analyze the things important to me in my own mortal life. The AAEP and its Foundation resonated with me and mobilized my thoughts to contribute to its existence for future generations of colleagues. I just wanted to \"do my part\" to help this organization flourish for years to come. What advice would you like to share with other members? It would be to encourage others to consider the impact the AAEP Foundation has on horses, our profession and its members when making estate plans. My decision has given me a deep sense of satisfaction and comfort that I have contributed as a part of the Legacy Society. P.S.: United by our shared passion for the horse, the sincerity of the members of the AAEP as stewards for the horse has shaped the outcome of my life. It is through this realization that I encourage others to join me in the mission of the AAEP Foundation. Interested in joining the Legacy Society?

Schweizer and colleagues inSwitzerland aimed to evaluate the risk factors related toclinical injury in various horse racing disciplines in Switzerland. All race starts in flat, obstacle and trot racing over 4 years were analysed. This included a total of 17,760 race starts in1738 races at 10 racecourses. The age, sex, earnings,distance and time raced, place, jockey/driver, owner, trainer,track surface type and if grass, the surface conditions wererecorded. Racetrack vets recorded clinical and nonclinicalobservations and recorded these with a standardised'Veterinary Code system '. At least one Veterinary Code was recorded for 525 horses: the most common was nonclinical one, i.e. Non- Starter. The highest incidence of Veterinary Codes was associated with obstacle races (106/1000 starts), followed by flat races (27/1000) and then trot races (21/1000). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyse risk factors in each discipline. Horses were more often recorded as fallen or pulled up in obstacle races than in other disciplines. Horses nishing over eighth place had a higher risk of clinical events than those placed 1 -3i n flat, obstacle and trotting races. In trot racing, gait abnormalities and lameness were the most common Veterinary Codes recorded and there was a lower risk of clinical events for runners on Porphyre sand than on grass. The risk was approximately doubled for those whose driver was also their trainer. The researchers speculated that this may be due to trainers feeling more able to take risks when driving their own horse. Inflat racing, one racecourse had a higher risk of clinical event than some of the others but no associations were found relating to the racecourse surface. Obstacle races of over 2401 m carried a lower risk of injury. The researchers pointed out that some confounding factors may account for some of the associations found in this study, and that there is a need to improve the standardisation of event recording. However the study represents a positive initial step in identifying risk factors for racing injury that may allow steps to be taken towards prevention. Predictor variables for strangles In this retrospective case -control study, Lauren Duffee and colleagues in the USA evaluated predictor variables for andcomplications associated with Streptococcus equi ssp. equi infection (strangles) in horses. Medical records were reviewed and 108 horses with strangles (cases) and 215 horses without strangles (controls) were identi ed. Cases were de ned as horses with clinical signs of strangles (pyrexia, retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy,and mucopurulent nasal discharge) that were associated withac o n rmed strangles outbreak or had positive results for S. equi on PCR assay or bacteriological culture. Controls were dened as horses with pyrexia that did not meet the other criteria for cases. Data including signalment, clinical signs,diagnostic test results, and disease complications andoutcome were compared between cases and controls.Variables were identi ed using logistic regression.Clinical signs of strangles were not evident in 12 of 25 cases classi ed as S. equi carriers (infected >40 days). Predictor variables associated with strangles included mucopurulent nasal discharge and external abscesses in the pharyngeal region. Strangles was more likely to be diagnosed in the spring than in the summer. Cases with anaemia were more likely to develop purpura haemorrhagica than were cases without anaemia. No risk factors were identi ed for the development of guttural pouch empyema or metastatic abscesses. These results indicated that not all horses infected with S. equi develop clinical signs of strangles. Guttural pouch endoscopy and lavage with PCR assay of lavage fluid samples is recommended to identify S. equi carrier horses. Radial fracture risk factors The aim of this study by Suzanne Stewart and colleagues atthe University of Pennsylvania, USA, was to determine survivalto discharge of horses with radial fractures and also todetermine risk factors affecting survival to hospital dischargein conservative and surgically managed fractures. Medical records and radiographs of horses admitted with radial fracture were reviewed and horses with osteochondralfragmentation of the distal aspect of the radius or stressfractures were excluded. Evaluated risk factors were age,fracture con guration, surgical repair method, surgical duration, hospitalisation time, implant failure rate, andsurgical site infection (SSI) rate. Of the 54 horses that met the inclusion criteria, overall survival to discharge was 50%. Thirteen (24%) were subjectedto euthanasia on admission because of either fractureseverity, presence of an open fracture or nancial constraints. Fourteen (26%) horses with minimally displaced incompletefractures were conservatively managed and 12 (86%)survived to discharge. Twenty-seven (50%) horses had surgicaltreatment by open reduction and internal xation (ORIF) and 15 (56%) survived to hospital discharge. Open fractures weresigni cantly more likely to develop SSI, which also resulted in a 17-fold increase in implant failure. Of 8 surgically managedhorses with an open fracture, 6 did not survive to discharge.Outcome was also adversely affected by age and surgicalduration >168 min. Presence of SSI trended towards a decreased survival rate. Prognosis for survival to discharge with minimally displaced incomplete fractures is good. Young horses have a good prognosis survival to discharge for ORIF, whereas ORIF in adult horses has a poor prognosis and SSI strongly correlates with catastrophic implant failure. Gentamicin concentrations in hospitalised horses The objectives of this retrospective study by J.R. Bauquier andcolleagues in the USA and Australia were to determine therelationship between gentamicin dose and plasmaconcentration in hospitalised horses, and to identify a startingdose range to achieve peaks >32 lg/ml. Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antimicrobial commonly used in at 6.6 mg/kg i.v. once daily. Therapeutic drugmonitoring (TDM) can con rm desired peak concentration is \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd119 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016reached for common bacterial isolates, and detect toxicosisassociated with high trough values. Data including weight, dose, plasma peak, and trough gentamicin concentration, creatinine concentrations andpresence of focal or systemic disease were collected frommedical records of 65 hospitalised horses who were receivingonce-daily gentamicin with TDM performed (99 sets). Peakconcentrations measured 25 -35 min after administration were included (n =77). Data were divided into low ( <7.7 -9.7 mg/kg) and high ( >9.7 mg/kg) dose groups, and were grouped by the horse having focal or systemic disease. Peak concentrations resulting from doses 7.7 mg/kg were 5.74 lg/ml (s.e. 2.1 lg/ml) greater than peaks from doses <7.7 mg/kg. Peak concentration was 3.6 times more likely to be >32lg/ml if the dose was 7.7 mg/kg. There were no signi cant effects of dose on trough or creatinine concentration. At a given dose, horses with focal diseasehad higher peaks than those with systemic disease. The data from this study suggests gentamicin dosage should be individually determined in horses using TDM, but support aninitial once-daily dose of 7.7 -9.7 mg/kg i.v. to achieve peaks >32lg/ml and trough concentrations <2lg/ml. Further studies evaluating the safety of doses >6.6 mg/kg are required. Anatomy of nasal conchal bullae In this study, T. Liuti and colleagues based at the University ofEdinburgh describe the anatomy of the dorsal and ventralnasal conchal bullae in normal horses using of dorsal and conchal bullae be clinically sinusitis. study aimed todescribe the computed tomographic anatomy of thesestructures: 90 equine heads were obtained from abattoirsand their age estimated from dentition. Computedtomographic images were acquired and examined bydiplomats. Specimens with dental or sinonasal disease(con rmed by skull sectioning and gross examination) were excluded from the study, leaving 60 specimens. Imaging software (OsiriX) was used to create multi- dimensional reconstructions and measure height, length and width of dorsal and ventral bullae allowing the volume of each bulla to be calculated. Height, length and width of each head also provided a volume for each skull. The dorsal conchal bullae were found to be greater in volume (average 24 cm 3) than ventral conchal bullae (average 15 cm3) and these were related to head size. In both dorsal and ventral bullae, there were signi cant differences in the volumes between different age groups, with those in the youngest group (0 -5 years) having signi cantly smaller volumes than those in the oldest group (over 16 years). In the case of the ventral conchal bullae, this could be explained by the larger size of cheek teeth alveoli protruding into the nasal cavity in younger horses. In the majority of horses (81.3%) the rostral limit of the dorsal conchal bulla was parallel to Triadan 07s. The caudal limit was parallel to Triadan 10s in 61% and the 09s in 30.5%. The rostral limit to Triadan 07s in 78% the caudal limit parallel to the 09s in 64.5% and the 10s in 32%. This shows that in some horses the caudal limits of the ventral conchal bulla can overlap with the rostral extent of the rostral maxillary sinus.This study provides information on the anatomical features of dorsal and ventral conchal bullae and their relationship with adjacent structures and will help in identifying which structures are involved in sinus disease. Monitoring acute equine visceral pain This study, by Johannes van Loon and Machteld VanDierendonck from The Netherlands and Belgium, describesscale construction and clinical applicability of the EquineUtrecht University Scale for Composite Pain Assessment (EQUUS-COMPASS) and the Equine Utrecht University Scale for FacialAssessment of Pain (EQUUS-FAP) in horses with acute colic. This cohort study was performed using 50 adult horses (25 with acute colic and 25 controls). Composite pain scores wereassessed by direct observations and Visual Analog Scale (VAS)scores were assessed from video clips. Colic patients wereassessed at arrival, and on the rst and second mornings after arrival. Both the EQUUS-COMPASS and EQUUS-FAP scoresshowed high inter-observer reliability (ICC COMPASS, =0.93 for EQUUS-FAP, P <0.001), while a moderate inter-observer reliability for the VAS scores was found(ICC =0.63, P <0.001). The cut-off value for differentiation between healthy and colic horses for the EQUUS-COMPASSwas 5, and for differentiation between conservatively treatedand surgically treated or euthanased patients it was 11. For theEQUUS-FAP, cut-off values were 4 and 6, respectively. Internalsensitivity and speci city were good for both EQUUS-COMPASS 84.0%) and EQUUS-FAP The use of the EQUUS-COMPASS and EQUUS-FAP enabled repeated and objective scoring of pain in horses with acute colic. The authors plan to perform a follow- up study with new patients and control animals to further validate the constructed scales that are described in this study. S.

For somehorse owners, discussing their own calorie intake in detail is anormal part of their conversation, but they may still measuretheir horses 'feed volumetrically, i.e. in terms of flakes, scoops or cups (Murray et al. 2015). Few perhaps really recognise the power of nutrition. My very elderly retired horse, with no ability to chew or ingest short or long bre, reminds me daily of how powerful nutrition can be. She is in the middle of her third summer of living purely on soaked feed. Despite this, she has maintained great body condition with good muscle de nition etc. However, relatively sma\"ll changes in her ration composition can result in clinical signs of abdominal pain or inappetance. Very few people dispute that nutrition is key to health and performance and information about what we should and should not eat for this or that reason is almost constantly being provided via one or more media source(s). Why then are certain nutrition-associated conditions, such as obesity, on the increase both in man and horses? Horse owners seem to be keen to learn more about nutrition, with tens of thousands (Murray et al. 2015) signing up for increasingly available online nutrition courses. Despite this, from personal experience, when discussing nutrition, there is still a lot of confusion and misunderstanding. Published reviews of feeding practices also often reveal dietary practices that are contrary to current best practice (Burk and Williams 2008; Hoffman et al. 2009). Although many of the owner completed surveys are undertaken in high performance horses (thereby perhaps fuelling the myth that feeding optimally is not key to health and performance) they provide no insight into how much better the animals might perform if their nutrition was improved, nor the short- and long-term health bene ts of a more optimal diet. Nutrition associated clinical conditions are also commonly found in these animals. However, it seems that some horses cope wellin spite of how we feed and manage them, whereas others have an adverse response to even a relatively minor change. Increasingly, we are appreciating that the effect of nutrition reflects not only the nutrients and the feedstuffs that provide these, but also variation in individual physiology (i.e. metabolism as well as gut microbiota). Recent work, for example, has suggested that dietary-induced modulation of the microbiota might be important in the effect of diet on horse behaviour (Destrez et al. 2015). Jansson and Harris (2013) evaluated the practical uptake of research published on the nutrition of the exercising horse from 1970 to 2010. The conclusion was that whilst some ndings have been incorporated into routine practice (e.g. reduction in starch intake even inperformance animals and an increase in the use of oilsupplementation), not all have been; the question is whynot? Is this because the research had no practicalapplication; does it re flect our inability to successfully translate science into practice? Or is it nutrition itself that isthe issue? To many, nutrition is not a 'sexy science '; there are few simple diagnostic tests (especially ones that can beused horse-side) to determine if a case is de cient in a key nutrient, or if the ration is imbalanced.Nutrition (taken to include diet plus nutritional management) in fluences equine health, behaviour, performance and welfare as well as the environment. There isan important role here for the veterinary surgeon, who is oftenconsidered to be a major source of good quality nutritioninformation (Hoffman et al. 2009; AHP 2012; Murray et al. 2015). But should veterinarians be regarded as such a source and dothey have suf cient up-to-date knowledge to give such advice? My view is that it is essential that all equine veterinarians keep up to date with the principles of good nutritional practice. Veterinarians should understand the impact that nutrition can have as a cause and in the treatment/management of various equine diseases and conditions. The veterinarian should also know when and whom to reach out to for more complicated cases (e.g. Diplomates with an equine nutrition speciality within the European College of Veterinary and Comparative Nutrition, the American College of Veterinary Nutrition, the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine or active researchers in the area). Although there are many excellent nonveterinary equine 'nutritionists ', to my knowledge, currently there is no uni ed accreditation system for this group as a whole or a global system denoting demonstrable expertise -an opportunity for the future perhaps? A relatively old review of nutrition education within the USA (Buf ngton et al. 1996), as reviewed by Roberts and Murray (2014), suggested that many veterinarians did not consider that their nutrition education was t for purpose. This was supported by a more recent in-depth study in Georgia (Roberts and Murray 2013), where veterinarians stated that they were not very con dent in giving equine nutritional advice for several nutrition associated disorders. Of note, most respondingveterinarians had not attended any equine nutrition continuingeducation in the last year. It is hoped that this series of articles inEVE will help address some of the continuing education issues. The American College of Veterinary Nutrition, with assistancefrom the American Academy of Veterinary Nutrition and theEuropean College of Veterinary and Comparative Nutrition,have recently proposed equine nutrition competencies forgraduating veterinarians. A recent survey of 14 veterinaryschools in Europe and the Middle East (Becvarova et al. 2015) suggested that whilst the University Deans and faculty membersall recognised that nutrition (all species) was very important(averaged 4 out of 5 in importance), 41% of those surveyed saidthey were not satis ed with the nutritional skills and performance of their graduates. Obviously there are a numberof barriers to improving nutrition training: not least a verycrowded current curriculum. However, given the increasingrecognition of the importance of nutrition in health (includingperformance) and disease (e.g. obesity, laminitis, equinerhabdomyolysis syndrome, colic, gastric ulcers), I hope thatmore veterinarians will consider nutrition as an important part oftheir continuing education and collaborate more withspecialists in veterinary nutrition. I am therefore very pleased to be part of this drive to introduce a series of Clinical Nutrition Articles through EVE to veterinarians around the world. I would like to thank the \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd121 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016contributors and the reviewers who have made this possibleand I trust that the articles will prove to be informative andvaluable.

T. Moore*, W. Schroederand C. Staszyk\u00a7 Moore Equine Medical and Dental Services, Georgetown, Texas, USA;Equine Surgery and Radiology, Freie Universit of Veterinary describes the clinical presentation andhistopathological ndings of two horses with equine odontoclastic tooth (EOTRH) Equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis is a well documented condition known to affect the incisors, canines and occasionally the premolars in horses. At this time there have been no documented cases of EORTH affecting all cheek teeth described in the peer reviewed literature. This paper documents the rst reported cases of EOTRH affecting the cheek teeth in one horse in the United States and one from Germany. Introduction During the last decade, incisor disorders associated withdental resorption and bulbous enlargement of the intra-alveolar parts of the teeth have been described in severalreports (Gregory et al. 2006; Baratt 2007; Caldwell 2007; Kreutzer et al. 2007). The condition appears to be the result of two separate cellular processes, i.e. odontoclastic toothresorption and hypercementosis characterised by 2008; Sykora et al. 2014; Lorello al. 2015). term equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (EOTRH) 2008). Equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis is a well described painful condition known to affect the incisors, canines and occasionally the premolars of older horses (Staszyk et al. 2008). Some horses show more resorptive lesions of the root and alveolar bone while others exhibit hypercementosis leading to a bulbous enlargement of the reserve crown 2012; Earley and Rawlinson 2013; Sykora et al. 2014). Clinically, most cases present with varying degrees of gingivitis, periodontitis, gingival recession, alveolar bone protrusion and due to hypercementosis, alveolar bone loss, osteomyelitis, loss or disruption of pulp canal, and intra-alveolar root fractures (Staszyk et al. 2008; Earley and Rawlinson 2013). The disruption in the normal intra-alveolar dental architecture creates an environment that appears to facilitate periodontal disease(Rawlinson and Earley 2013). Resorptive lesions have been documented to involve the cementum, enamel, dentine and occasionally the pulp cavity (Staszyk et al. 2008). Histological examination has revealed extensive in ltration of white blood cells into the resorptive lesions while the affected tooth margins contain odontoclasts housed in Howship 's lacunae (Staszyk et al. 2008). Regions of hypercementosis have been described to cover Howship 's lacunae as well as normal portions of the root with irregular cementum deposited in a layered pattern (Staszyk et al. 2008). Severe cases can have extremely bulbous roots and reserve crowns several times larger than the original healthy tooth. The aetiology of this condition is currently poorly understood but recent work by Sykora et al. (2014) has revealed a potential involvement of Treponema and Tannerella spp. in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease that can occur with EOTRH. Resorptive lesions have been reported in other species as well as in man. In cats, a condition known as feline odontoclastic resorptive lesions (FORL, syn. resorptive lesions RL) is aetiology (Gorrel and Larsson 2002; Reiter and Mendoza 2002) that shares certain characteristics with EOTRH such as the in ltration of inflammatory cells into the resorptive lesions; however, FORLs lack the excessive hypercementosis often seen with EOTRH (Earley and Rawlinson 2013). Furthermore, FORLs are reported to occur more often in the molar and premolar teeth (Roux et al. 2005) in contrast to EOTRH which has been mostly reported in the incisors and canine teeth until this report. Notreatment other than exodontia is currently available (Earleyand Rawlinson 2013) and this report is the rst to document the occurrence of EOTRH affecting cheek teeth (CT). Themodi ed Triadan system of nomenclature is used throughout this report (Triadan 1972; Floyd 1991). Case 1 A 20-year-old Arabian gelding was initially examined byMoore Equine Medical and Dental Services for behaviouralchanges that had developed over several months. The horsewas exhibiting head-shyness and appeared to have dif culty eating. The horse had received regular dental care sinceliving with the current owner (5 years). Following sedation, anoral examination revealed slightly protuberant maxillary teethand lingual margins of mandibular teeth were but \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd123 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016no soft tissue lacerations were present. Further inspectionrevealed that all cheek teeth were wider than usual and thatthe increased width of the tooth was due to an increase inthe peripheral cementum ( Fig 1 ). No signi cant abnormalities were noticed on the incisors although mild calculus accumulation was present on several teeth. Each cheek tooth was visualised independently using oroscopy as well as an intraoral mirror and a well de ned layered pattern of hypercementosis with focal regions ofpitting was visualised on the buccal aspect of of the maxillary CT ( Fig 2 ). All cheek teeth were also found to be unusually mobile withthe maxillary 06s being the most affected and having arange of mobility estimated to be 2 mm using very lightpressure with Hewson forceps. No signi cant periodontal disease or gingivitis was noted. Lateral and oblique extraoral radiographs of all CT quadrants revealed blunting of the loss or disruption of the lamina dura, bulbous enlargement and an irregular appearance of the roots on all cheek teeth ( Fig 3 ), consistent with previous reports of EOTRH in incisors (Staszyk et al. 2008). Intraoral radiographs of the incisors resorptivelesions the 03 maxillary incisors being themost affected ( Fig 4 ).Based on the ndings of the oral examination and radiographs, a diagnosis of EOTRH was made. The incisors were classi ed as being mildly affected while the CT were moderately affected. Minor odontoplasty was performed and care taken to ensure that the pressure and forces of mastication were distributed as evenly as possible on all CT. A complete blood count and serum chemistry analysis were performed and all parameters were within normal limits. The horse was placed on a nutraceutical that has shown some promise in potentially ameliorating some of the changes associated with EOTRH (Simhofer and Kowelka 2012). The owner reported an almost immediate improvement in the horse 's head-shyness and appetite. Approximately 10 months post initial presentation, the owner began noticing a slight head tilt while the horse was eating. A follow-up examination was performed and revealed a fractured 309. Radiographs were taken to assess any progression of the disease. No signi cant differences were noted on any teeth except for a mild increase in the resorptive lesion on the root of the 303 incisor. The fractured 309 CT was extracted orally under endoscopic guidance with the horse sedated and standing. No complications were encountered during the extraction a) b) Fig 1: Intraoral photographs, Case 1 , (a) Excessive cementum deposits on the palatal margins of maxillary cheek teeth and (b) on the buccal aspects of the mandibular cheek teeth. a) b) Fig 2: Intraoral photographs, Case 1 , (a) and (b) Well-de ned layered hypercementosis with focal regions of pitting on the buccal margins of the mandibular cheek teeth. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd124 VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016and a follow-up examination 30 days later revealed that thesocket was approximately 80% lled-in with healthy granulation tissue. Examination of extracted 309 Macroscopic ndings -dental surfaces Gross examination of the extracted 309 revealedhypercementosis with layered deposition lines visible.Signi cantly more cementum was noted on the buccal than the lingual side. The roots were blunted and consistent with the radiographic changes described. The intra-alveolar regions displayed an irregular pattern made up of cementum-like tissue. In certain regions, dark soft tissues were noted within the cemental surface. Macroscopic ndings -sectioned surfaces The tooth was further evaluated by performing horizontalsections. Sections were made using a diamond-coated bandsaw with water cooling to minimise frictional heat. Thedominant substance was a cementum-like calci ed tissue featuring marked incremental lines indicative of a layeredpattern of deposition. In several locations, irregular regions ofblackish soft tissue were present re flecting local tissue necrosis.Histopathological ndings Histopathological specimens were decalci ed (EDTA, room temperature, pH 8.0) and embedded in paraf n wax. Subsequently, serial 5 lm sections were cut, stained using haematoxylin and eosin, and examined under a lightmicroscope (Staszyk et al. 2008). Pathohistological features typical for EOTRH were found. First, remnants of unchanged secondary dentine and normalequine cementum were present. These regions were mainlyseen in central portions of the tooth sections. The peripheralborders showed numerous signs of odontoclastic toothresorption, ongoing odontoclastic resorption and activeodontoclasts were present ( Fig 5 ). Second, the largest area of the tooth sections was dominated by large amounts of irregular cementum featuringlarge vascular channels, Nonparallel, wavy incremental lines were visible indicating alargely unregulated deposition of irregular cementum ( Fig 5 ). Third, vascular granulation tissue with leucocytic inltrations was seen in peripheral positions as well as in central positions in ltrating between mineralised tissues. In most positions the interface between the granulation tissue a) b) Fig 4: Radiographs Case 1 , Maxillary incisors, (b) canines with the #3 maxillary incisors being the most affected. a) b) Fig 3: Radiographs, Case 1 , (a) Blunting of the roots of all mandibular and (b) maxillary cheek teeth. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd125 EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016and the mineralised tissue was dominated by cementoblast-like cells producing new (irregular) cementum. In somepositions odontoclasts were present causing ongoing toothresorption ( Fig 5 ). The histopathological features described con rmed the diagnosis of a hypercementotic form of EOTRH. Case 2 A 38-year-old Shetland pony mare was referred to theequine teaching hospital of the Freie Universit \u20acat Berlin emergency service for evaluation of inappetance that hadpersisted for several days. The referring veterinariansuspected dental disease may have been responsible for theprolonged loss of appetite and reported a foul odouroriginating from the mouth as well as ptyalism duringmastication. According to the owner, the pony had beenlosing weight recently even though her diet consisted of amash and soaked hay cubes. The horse had not received regular dental care in the 34 years she had lived with the current owner. Haematologyand serum biochemistry revealed hyperlipidaemia and leucocytosis all of the other blood parameters were within normal limits. Following treatment and resolution of the hyperlipidaemia, a complete oral examination was performed with the horse sedated and revealed severe bulbous enlargement of reserve crown and roots, severe gingivitis, periodontitis and gingival recession affecting all incisors ( Fig 6 ). The maxillary 03s were displaced horizontally (Fig 6 ). Additionally, erythema affecting the mucosa of the lower lip was noted ( Fig 6 ). A pronounced step and wave mouth were present in the CT dentition but only a few margins of the mandibular and maxillary teeth were sharp. Further inspection by using an intraoral mirror revealed that all CT were wider than usual due to an increase in the peripheral cementum. All CT were also found to be mobile by digital pressure. The 206 CT was missing and the 411 was displaced rostrally and very loose. Mild gingivitis and periodontitis around some of the CT were noted. a) b) c)d) f)e) Fig 5: EOTRH in cheek teeth of a 20-year-old Arabian gelding ( Case 1 ). a) Extracted 309, mesiolingual view.

The radiographs of the cheek teeth con rmed the wear abnormalities of the occlusal surface that were found during oral examination and revealed blunting of the roots, loss of the lamina dura, partial alveolar bone loss, severe bulbous enlargement and an irregular appearance of the roots on all cheek teeth (Fig 8 ). Radiographs of the incisors showed typical severe radiological signs of EOTRH ( Fig 7 ) described by H \u20aculset al. (2012). Based on the ndings of the oral examination and radiographs a diagnosis of severe EOTRH affecting all teeth was made. Senile CT are typically mostly composed of cementum as the rest of the dental materials such as enamel are worn away during the course of the normal attrition; this could create some confusion with EOTRH. It is important to note that in CT affected by EOTRH it is the disproportionate quantity of cementum relative to dentin and enamel combined with the radiographic ndings described that distinguish it from normal geriatric changes. All incisors and 411 were extracted under sedation and local anaesthesia. All extracted teeth were submitted for histopathology. Due to the horse 's age and the severe abnormalities of wear, no dental equilibration was performed. The pony recovered well after exodontia and showed a good appetitefor soaked feed. She was treated with flunixin meglumine(1.1 mg/kg bwt) for 6 days after surgery. The pony was discharged 14 days after presentation. Five months later the referring veterinarian had to extract some more cheek teeth due to further loosening. However, according to the owner, the pony was eating and doing well. Examination of extracted teeth Macroscopic ndings -dental surfaces All incisors and the 411 CT were extracted. These teethshared the same macroscopic appearance. The reservecrowns were largely worn away and the occlusal surfacesshowed the typical characteristics of senile equine teeth, i.e.only remnants of enamel ridges were present. The shape andangulation of the supragingival parts of the teeth were highlyirregular indicating severe malocclusion. The morphology ofthe intra-alveolar parts of the teeth was highly remodelled.Instead of featuring clearly de ned roots, the intra-alveolar portions consisted of rounded protrusions. The intra-alveolardental regions showed the same characteristics as describedforCase 1 which were deposits of cementum-like tissue with areas containing necrotic tissue ( Fig 8 ). Histopathological ndings Further histopathological investigations were performed on allright upper and lower incisors as well as on tooth 411. Thehistopathological ndings were the same as described for a) b) Fig 7: Radiographs Case 2 , (a) Mandibular incisors and (b) incisors. a) 6: Photographs, Case 2 , Maxillary incisors AE / MARCH 2016Case 1 and the diagnosis of a hypercementotic form of EOTRH was con rmed ( Fig 8 ). Discussion Both cases presented were diagnosed with ahypercementotic form of EOTRH that was evident grossly,radiographically and con rmed histopathologically. The two cases differed signi cantly in terms of severity suggesting there may be a wide range of presentations for this condition. Clinical signs The equine hypsodont tooth is typically composed of threetypes of peripheral cementum (Kilic et al. 1997b). Peripheral enamel is directly surrounded by a thin layer of primarycementum that contributes to the amelocemental junction(Mitchell et al. 2003). A thicker layer of secondary cementum is deposited over the primary cementum and it is into thismaterial that the periodontal ligament (PDL) attaches andprovides anchorage of the tooth (Mitchell et al. 2003). Tertiary cementum (or clinical crown cementum) is produced anddeposited at the subgingival level. Once erupted, this material becomes a structural component of the clinical crown providing support for the hard but brittle enamel ridges (Mitchell et al. 2003, Staszyk et al. 2015). Equine peripheral cementum at the occlusal level is known to be thicker on the palatal aspect of maxillary CT compared with the buccal surface (Kilic et al. 1997a, Mitchell et al. 2003). The opposite is found on the mandibular CT where thicker peripheral cementum is present on the buccal surface compared with the lingual border (Mitchell et al. 2003). In both cases, there was an exaggeration of this normal pattern with cementum deposits showing visible incremental lines. These features suggest that a transition occurs where normal clinical crown cementum deposition becomes unregulated and disproportionate. This macroscopic nding has been con rmed by the histological demonstration of high amounts of irregular cementum. It is emphasised that the presence of exaggerated amounts of irregular clinical crown cementum was the only visible sign of cheek tooth EOTRH in Case 1 , apart from radiological signs. Contrary to Case 1 , the a) b) c)d) e) f) Fig 8: EOTRH in cheek teeth of a 38-year-old Shetland pony ( Case 2 ). a) Radiograph showing bulbous enlargements of all cheek teeth and blunting of the dental roots. b) Extracted 411, lingual view.

Green arrowheads: EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016second case also displayed mild gingivitis and periodontitisassociated with some of the CT. The described cases suggest that there is a difference between incisor and CT EOTRH in terms of the presence ofvisible pathognomonic clinical signs. Incisor EOTRH is mostlyassociated with painful (Baratt 2007;Caldwell 2007; Kreutzer al. 2008). In contrast CT EOTRH seems to feature only moderate periodontal changes and characteristic changes in clinical crown cementum might remain undetected. Although these assumptions need to be con rmed by further investigations in more horses with CT EOTRH, there is reason to speculate whether CT EOTRH has a much lower prevalence than incisor EOTRH or whether the prevalence of CT EOTRH is underestimated at this time. In summary, there were two key indicators suggestive of CT EOTRH in these cases: Wider than usual CT (can be subtle to detect) with the spatial layered hypercementosis pattern previously described Unusual mobility of CT detected when the grinding burrwas placed against the teeth. Aetiological considerations There is a notable spatial pattern in EOTRH affecting theincisors that suggests the existence of a biomechanical factorcontributing to the aetiology of this disease. It has beenshown that periodontal areas affected by highbiomechanical loads (palatal/lingual aspects near the roottip) coincide with the position of initial resorptive lesions inincisors (Schrock et al. 2013). In both cases presented here, a clear special pattern of additional deposits of irregularcementum was also noted in the CT, i.e. palatal side ofmaxillary CT and buccal side of mandibular CT- Exactly thesesides were found to be highly affected by highbiomechanical stresses during the power stroke of themasticatory cycle, especially in older horses (Cordes et al. 2012) which further supports a biomechanical involvement inthe pathogenesis of EORTH. The biomechanical stresses thatoccur in the CT of aged horses were estimated to be highenough to cause at least two harmful processes withindifferent areas of the periodontium. First, it is assumed thatgingival damage occurs, leading to periodontal pocketingand microbial infection of the periodontal ligament (Cordeset al. 2012). Second, focal overload within the depth of the alveolus causes periodontal micronecrosis and initiatescytokine release. Subsequently, clastic cells are attractedand start the process of odontoclastic tooth resorption(Brudvik and Rygh 1994). However, odontoclastic toothresorption is often a temporary process and after a while theresorbed areas become repaired by regular cementum,resulting in reattachment of the tooth to the periodontaltissues (Langford and Sims 1982; Reiter et al. 2005; DeLaurier et al. 2009). In EOTRH it seems that the process of tooth resorption is maintained and that concomitantly the process of cementalrepair becomes deregulated and unlimited. A possibleexplanation for this condition comes from the nding that incisor EOTRH is associated with the presence of differentspecies of Treponema and Tannerella (Sykora et al. 2014). The persistent infection with these microorganisms mightrepresent the major factor that preserves the stimulus for the continued recruitment of odontoclastic cells and subsequently deposition of high amounts of irregular cementum. Thus, EOTRH is assumed to be caused by at least two factors, i.e. rst, focal periodontal damage initiating odontoclastic tooth resorption and second, persistent infection with distinct microorganisms preserving an inflammatory environment with continued recruitment of clastic cells. Clinical observations in incisor EOTRH suggest that the ratio between the predominant pathological process, i.e. odontoclastic tooth resorption and deposition of irregular cementum, varies greatly between horses (Staszyk et al. 2008; H\u20aculset al. 2012). This is re flected by the presence of resorptive lesions and hypercementotic areas to a different extent. Therefore, it has been proposed to de ne at least three different types of EOTRH according to the predominant histological/radiological changes, i.e. a hypercementotic, resorptive and a mixed type (H \u20aculset al. 2012). The resorptive type is assumed to feature mainly in flammatory processes that lead to odontoclastic resorption. In contrast, the hypercementotic type mainly shows reparative processes in terms of deposition of cementum. However, it is emphasised that in all de ned types, all of the typical features of EOTRH were found concomitantly, i.e. odontoclastic resorption and hypercementosis (Staszyk et al. 2008; H \u20aculset al. 2012). Further studies are required to con rm whether these clinical and histopathological observations are actually correlated withthe presence of distinct microorganism as suggested (Sykora et al. 2014). Nevertheless, the presented cases of cheek tooth EOTRH do not contradict the current concepts of the possible aetiology of EOTRH. Incisor EOTRH and cheek tooth EOTRH share many features in terms of radiological ndings, macroscopic appearance of extracted teeth and even histological ndings. Although some differences in clinical signs are present between the two conditions, all the ndings with CT EOTRH fall within a range of features that are also found with incisor EOTRH. Clinical considerations At the time of writing, no treatment other than exodontia iscurrently available for severe cases of EOTRH (Earley andRawlinson 2013; Lorello et al. 2015). However, preliminary results of a blinded study on the effects of an additivefeedstuff made of a fungus mycelium (Equident) on EOTRHsuggests that there seems to be a positive effect on theclinical signs of EOTRH (Simhofer and Kowelka 2012). Finalresults of this study will show if this may be a palliativetreatment option for less severe cases. Anecdotally, dailycleaning of the incisors using a tooth brush and chlorhexidineor a similar disinfectant solution in combination withshortening of the incisors also seems to have a positive effecton in flammatory signs. Conclusion Until recently, EOTRH was predominantly reported to occur inthe incisors and canines. This report con rms that the condition may also affect the cheek teeth and that theclinical presentation may cover a wide spectrum in terms ofboth severity and clinical signs. Dental radiographs may be \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd129 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016warranted in cases where CT display increased mobility and/or if increased clinical crown cementum is noted during oralevaluation. Further studies are required to evaluate theprevalence, epidemiology and clinical relevance of thiscondition. Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

R. Baratt* Salem Valley Equine Salem, author by equine practitioners in private practiceand presented to colleagues at professional meetings(Gregory et al. 2006; Baratt 2007; Caldwell 2007). These practitioners described the clinical and radiographic featuresof a syndrome not previously identi ed in the horse. Subsequently, the histopathological features of this syndrome were described and the syndrome given a more descriptivename: equine odontoclastic tooth resorption and hypercementosis (EOTRH) (Staszyk et al. 2008). At meetings and in veterinary journals, equine practitioners subsequently reported similar cases worldwide (Lorello et al. 2015). Surprisingly, this newly described syndrome, although uncommon, was not rare. Examination of archived specimens would likely reveal that this 'new 'disease was present but unrecognised prior to 2006 although, to this author 's knowledge, this has not previously been documented in the literature. Similarly, tooth resorption affecting the equine cheek teeth has now been reported and may be documented by equine practitioners worldwide. While the embryology of the equine tooth closely follows tooth development in other species, the horse has unique anatomical and physiological adaptations in its radicular hypsodont dentition not present in man or other mammalian species (Staszyk et al. 2015). However, it is informative to examine tooth resorption in other species, includinglaboratory animals, in an effort to better understand thepathophysiology in the horse and to guide further researchefforts. In this issue, Moore et al. (2016), in addition to proposing that EOTRH affects the cheek teeth as well as theincisors and canines, have reviewed the EOTRH literature. It ishoped that this wider, cross-species literature review of toothresorption is of interest to the reader. Tooth resorption is actually a normal process required for the exfoliation of mammalian deciduous incisor, of root cementumand dentin is also a normal feature of permanent tooth roots inman. It is commonly found in the apical portion of the root andas it is normally accompanied by reparative processes, is notclinically recognised (Andreasen 1985). In the horse, it hasbeen demonstrated that the production of coronal cementuminvolves the surface resorption of enamel by odontoclasticcells, deposition of cementum cementoblasts(Jones and Boyde 1974; Sahara 2014). Cementum formation developing tooth is still incompletely understood. It hasbeen hypothesised that disruption of Hertwig 's epithelial root sheath (HERS) and contact of the surrounding dental folliclewith root dentin results in reciprocal induction of cementoblastsand root cementum. There the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation of HERSinto cementoblasts (Nanci 2013). The disintegration of HERSleaves clusters of epithelial cells, epithelial cell rests ofMalassez, which are incorporated into the developing periodontal ligament (PDL) which is of mesenchymal (dental follicle) origin. There is a growing body of work that would indicate that rather than 'resting ', the cell rests of Malassez play an active role in the maintenance and regeneration of the PDL (Xiong et al. 2013). Signi cantly, the absence of the epithelial cell rest of Malassez may prevent normal repair of damaged PDL, resulting in tooth resorption. In man, endodontic disease, periodontal disease and pressure-induced frontal resorption in orthodontic treatment all result in the presence of in flammatory cells and cytokines that stimulate the differentiation of and activation of osteoclasts. This appears to be regulated, in part, by signalling molecules in the tumour necrosis family (Ne et al. 1999; Darcey and Qualtrough 2013; Nanci 2013). The role of necrosis family of cytokine-like proteins (RANK, RANKL, osteoprotegrin [OPG]) in the pathogenesis of feline tooth resorption has been previously investigated (Senn et al. 2010). In this study, immunohistochemical staining with anti-RANK, anti-RANKL and anti-OPG antibodies at the sitesof active tooth resorption was noted. Similar studies havenot yet been reported in the horse. This form of toothresorption, in flammatory tooth resorption, has a similar radiographic appearance in man, domestic animals andthe horse. Initially, there are super cial (surface) areas of root resorption which on histological examination reveallarge clastic of Howship resorption Resorption of dentin progresses but the mantellayer of dentin appears to be resistant to resorption and thepulp is protected until secondary bacterial infection occurs.In man, when tooth resorption is due to pulpal necrosis,early root canal therapy can be curative. There are noreports presently that would indicate that endodonticdisease is the underlying cause of EOTRH. As pulpitis inmultiple incisor teeth would be highly improbable, thisaetiology for EOTRH is unlikely. While odontoclastic tooth resorption is quite prevalent in the domestic cat population and has been studiedextensively, the aetiology remains unclear. In the cat, earlyresorptive lesions were identi ed on all aspects of the root surface but appeared to fail to undergo repair at thecemento-enamel junction (DeLaurier et al. 2009). Interestingly, early resorptive lesions in the incisors of horses tend to belocated at the apical extent of the peripheral enamel, whichwould be the equivalent of the cemento-enamel junction inbrachydont species. While the cemento-enamel junction mayhave unique properties that predispose this site to resorption inthe cat and man, the unique anatomy of the horse makescomparison between these species dif cult. Tooth resorption localised to the cervical area in man also occurs, albeit rarely and this invasive cervical tooth resorptionappears to have distinct histological and clinical features from \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd131 EQUINE VETERINARY / AE / MARCH 2016external in flammatory tooth resorption that is the consequence of orthodontic forces, luxation/avulsion or pulpitis (Heithersay1999; Patel et al. 2009). Cervical tooth resorption is much more common in the cat (DeLaurier et al. 2009) and dog (Peralta et al. 2010). However, this pattern of tooth resorption is also seen clinically in the canine teeth of the horse. Thepathogenesis of this form of tooth resorption may involveexposed dentin at the cemento-enamel junction (Patel et al. 2009) but in a retrospective study in man (Heithersay 1999),orthodontic treatment, intracoronal bleaching ofendodontically-treated teeth and a history of trauma were themost frequently associated predisposing factors. One caseseries in man suggested an association between invasivecervical tooth resorption with feline herpes virus type 1 (von Arx et al. 2009). Invasive cervical tooth resorption rarely involves the pulp as the mantel layer of dentin appears to be resistant to clastic cells. Tooth resorption in man (Sch \u20acatzle et al. 2005) and in cats (Reiter et al. 2005) has also been hypothesised to be secondary to endocrine and systemic conditions. However, a survey of 109 cats showed no correlation of serum vitamin D3 levels and feline tooth resorption (Girard et al. 2010). Preliminary investigation has shown no relationship of EORTH and thyroid hormones in the horse (Earley et al. 2011). The PDL is a unique soft tissue of mesenchymal origin situated between two hard tissues (bone and cementum). There are resident stem cells within the PDL that can differentiate into both clastsic and blastic cells thatactively produce or remove cementum and alveolar bone. The regenerative ability of the PDL is the basis for guided tissue regeneration in the treatment of selective types of periodontal disease in man (Villar and Cochran 2010) and dogs (Gingerich and Stepaniuk 2011). It would appear that the broblasts within the PDL secrete factors that inhibit ankylosis of alveolar bone to dentin (Nanci 2013). Replantation of luxated teeth predictably results in root resorption only if the PDL undergoes drying or if the PDL is removed from the root surface (Andreasen 1985). A recent case series reported the preliminary success of replanted equine cheek teeth that had undergone extracorporal endodontic therapy (Stoll 2014). The authors of the accompanying paper hypothesise that the underlying cause of EOTRH may be due to the masticatory forces placed on the geriatric tooth of shorter root length (Schrock et al. 2013; Moore et al. 2016). This would be similar to the root resorption noted in people undergoing orthodontic treatment. With regards to hypercementosis, this appears to be a unique feature of equine periodontal disease. Generalised tooth resorption and hypercementosis has rarely been reported in man (Sch \u20acatzle et al. 2005) and is not a common feature of tooth resorption in the cat or dog. Hypercementosis, as noted in the accompanying paper, is a variable component of EOTRH. Cementomas are not an infrequent nding in association with apically infected cheek teeth and at the site of previously extracted apically infected cheek teeth. Perhaps the unregulated regenerative response of the PDL, with excessive cementum formation, is a unique feature of the horse.

Brooks Brownlie The Donkey Sanctuary, Sidmouth, Devon, UK; andSchool of Veterinary Sciences, University of email: faith.burden@thedonkeysanctuary.org.uk Keywords: haematology and serumbiochemistry for donkeys in a temperate climate have beenpreviously published using blood sample results from theresident population of a large donkey shelter in the UK.Periodic review of reference intervals is recommended toensure their applicability to the patient population andchanges in laboratory methods and technologies. The currentstudy aimed to revise the previously published haematologyand serum biochemistry values for the adult domestic donkey(Equus asinus ) in the UK in the light of a change in analytical equipment at the Donkey Sanctuary laboratory, but also torene the demography of the sample population with respect to age, physiology and clinical history. Clinical pathology results from 138 clinically healthy mature (4 -24 years inclusive) female and castrated male donkeys selected from the resident population of the Donkey Sanctuary, were analysed retrospectively. The animals were blood sampled during the period February 2008 to June 2011 as part of a routine health screen prior to rehoming. Results for a total of 38 biochemical and haematological parameters were analysed including 3 previously unreferenced parameters in addition to those assessed in the previous study. The new reference intervals and median values show very poor transferability with recently derived reference intervals for non-Thoroughbred horses and only limited transferability with reference intervals previously published for donkeys in the UK. Of particular note is a marked reduction in the upperreference limit for triglycerides of 2.8 mmol/l (from 4.3 mmol/ l) since this parameter is used to decide when donkeys are at risk of developing hyperlipaemia. This study demonstrates the value of intermittent review of reference intervals and renement of study populations. Notwithstanding the caution with which reference interval data from different laboratories should be compared, the lack of transferability of results between donkeys and horses highlights the importance of use of species-appropriate reference intervals for clinical decision-making. Background The domestic donkey ( Equus asinus ) is kept predominantly as a companion in the UK, Europe and North America, but isfrequently used as a working animal in developing countriesworldwide. Domestic donkeys are a unique equine speciesdescended from wild asses evolved to live in inhospitable,mountainous and arid desert environments (Epstein 1984).Their popularity as companions belies the relative dearth ofphysiological or scienti c data on the species compared with other commonly encountered domestic species and veterinarians encountering donkeys may nd it dif cult to obtain relevant reference intervals for biochemical and haematological blood parameters. Reference intervals for haematology and blood biochemistry parameters were previously established for domestic donkeys in the UK by French and Patrick (1995) using results from the resident population of a large specialised sanctuary (The Donkey Sanctuary). Other studies have focused on particular donkey breeds or presented data for speci c cohorts, often involving relatively small study populations and mixed aged groups, or which are pertinent to certain environmental conditions (Folch et al. 1997; Jordana et al. 1998; Mori et al. 2003, 2004; Caldin et al. 2005). Periodic review of reference intervals (RIs) is recommended in order to account for changes in laboratory methods and technologies (Anonymous 2011a). In addition, a marked increase in understanding speci c nutritional requirements of donkeys in recent years has led to changes in management practices (Cox et al. 2009; Burden et al. 2013), which could alter physiological parameters. This study is thus a timely revision of commonly used biochemical and haematological parameters for clinically healthy, mature donkeys. Materials and methods Study animals This study assessed the haematological and biochemicalblood pro les of 138 mature donkeys between the ages of 4 and 24 years. The donkeys were all owned and cared for by The Donkey Sanctuary and lived on farms in the South West of England. All donkeys were considered clinically healthy at the time of blood sampling, which was undertaken as part of assessment of suitability for rehoming of the animals to private homes. They were sampled in Autumn (n =41), Spring (n =32), Summer (n =35) and Winter (n =30) between February 2008 and June 2011. The study group consisted of 29 female and111 gelding donkeys. The donkeys were fed ad libitum straw with restricted quantities of haylage and grazing according tobody condition and prevailing weather conditions; donkeysalso had access to an equine speci c mineral block. None of the donkeys were working (draught or riding). Sampling and clinical assessment Blood samples were drawn from the jugular vein into 10 mlplain and EDTA-containing evacuated blood collection tubes(BD Vacutainer) 1.

Blood samples were taken as part of full clinical assessment toensure that the donkeys were t for rehoming. Clinical examinations and blood samples were carried out byveterinarians with experience of donkeys. Examinationinvolved thorough physical inspection from head to hoofincluding ophthalmoscopic examination, chest auscultationand dental assessment. If any signi cant clinical abnormalities were detected the donkey was excluded from the study. Fullclinical records relating to each donkey were reviewed anddonkeys excluded from the study if they had suffered fromsigni cant health problems within the 6 months prior to sampling. The only pharmaceutically-active agents to havebeen used during this 6 month period were licenseddeworming products. Common clinical conditions includingseedy toe, minor dental abnormalities and super cial skin wounds were not considered signi cant and donkeys with these conditions at the time of sampling or having had themin the 6 months prior to sampling were not excluded from thestudy. The donkeys were assigned a body condition score(BCS) using a standard scale of 1 -5 according to Svendsen (2008) and excluded from the study if they were underweight(BCS 2) or obese (BCS 4.5) by this score. In total 138 animals were included in the study; the majority of animals had fullhaematological and biochemical pro les but where particular parameters were not assessed the total numbersreported re flect this. Laboratory analysis All samples were transported promptly to the laboratory atthe Donkey Sanctuary, centrifuged and separated within 2 hof collection for biochemical analysis and subsequentlyrefrigerated. Samples were analysed in-house within 24 h ofsampling. Blood samples in EDTA evacuated tubes were analysed using an automated cell counter (Sysmex XT 2000i) 2 calibrated previously for donkey samples. Parametersassessed by the automated counter included counts oferythrocytes (RBC), total leucocytes (WBC) and platelets(PLT); width (RDW) and haematocrit (calculatedPCV). of eosinophils (Eos), monocytes microscopicexamination of Giesma-stained thin blood smears; 200 cellswere counted to determine the differential cell count. Automated biochemical analyses (Roche Integra 400 analyser) 3were undertaken on serum calcium (Ca), (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl) and cholesterol (Chol). Bile acids were evaluated in a limited number of cases (84/138). Quality assurance In addition to in-house quality control and calibration, all 20biochemistry analytes tested were validated monthly across 3external assurance (QA) schemes provided by 'Sysmex e-Check (XE) 'control samples on a daily basis prior to testing. Data analysis The data from 18 haematological and 20 biochemicalanalytes were transferred into Excel 4and the mean, standard deviation (s.d.), sample variance, kurtosis, skew, range, count and con dence intervals (90%) calculated. This exploratory analysis of the dataset showed that the observations were, in the majority, non-normally distributed; as a result, nonparametric analyses were undertaken (SPSS were identi above Q3 +1.5 (IQR) and removed if biologically implausible or if credible were included in further analysis. A reference interval was then established from the central 95% interval by removal of the lower and upper 2.5% of the interval for eachparameter, thus the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles were obtained according to The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry (IFCC) protocol for nonparametric data. Ninety percent con dence intervals were calculated for the upper and lower RIs (MedCalc). Reference interval transference validation Reference interval transference validation of new RIs fordonkeys was undertaken to determine transferability withcandidate RIs established for mature non-Thoroughbredhorses (Anonymous 2011a), previously established RIs fordonkeys (French and Patrick 1995), RIs for donkeys inMexico (de Aluja et al. 2006) and RIs for donkeys in Ethiopia (Lemma and Moges 2009). Reference intervaltransference validation was undertaken according toAmerican Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology (ASCVP)guidelines (Anonymous 2011a) on the transference andvalidation of RIs between laboratories. In short, 40 samplesrepresentative of the newly established RIs for donkeys wereevaluated against the candidate RI for transference. UsingASCVP guidelines, if 4/40 (10%) of the values fall outside of the candidate RI then transference is rejected for the analyte. Results In total, blood samples from 138 donkeys were examined. Thedonkeys ranged in age from 4 to 24 years; the cohortconsisted of 29 females (aged 5 -24 years, mean 13.1 years) and 111 geldings (aged 4 -22 years, mean 12 years). All donkeys included in the study were found to be clinically healthy. The median BCS in the cohort was 3/5 (range 2.5 -4). Median reference values, RIs (2.5 and 97.5 percentiles) and 90% CIs for the quanti ed haematological and biochemical parameters are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Reference interval transference To assess the transferability of these new RIs with thosedeveloped for other populations reference intervaltransference validation was undertaken. Reference intervaltransference validation data for new haematological andbiochemical RIs are shown in Tables 1 and 2. This validation showed that 0/15 haematological and 4/20 biochemical RIs were transferrable between these new RIs for donkeys and \u00a92015 The Donkey Sanctuary.

Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. on behalf of EVJ Ltd.136 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016studies have assessed the biochemical or haematologicalcharacteristics of donkey blood using study animals fromdistinct populations from around the world. A previous studyby French and Patrick (1995) established reference intervalsusing a similar UK donkey population to the current one andthese reference values have been used by The DonkeySanctuary for clinical assessment of resident and nonresidentanimals for nearly 20 years. It is timely to review thosepreviously published reference intervals in view of changes inmethods and technologies at the diagnostic laboratory ofthe Donkey Sanctuary. In addition, nutritional and othermanagement practices have evolved with the increase inunderstanding of the unique requirements of donkey, andthese developments could affect physiological parameters. It was not possible to directly compare these new RIs with those of the study by French and Patrick (1995) as the rawdata for the former was not available. In any case analyticalequipment used was not the same in each study and 3parameters (PLTs, RDW% and bile acids) had not beenpreviously established. To assess the transferability of thesenew RIs with those developed for other populations referenceinterval transference validation was undertaken. When RItransference validation was undertaken, 15/18haematological and 14/19 biochemical RIs were transferrablebetween previous donkey RIs and these RIs. However, oncloser inspection, it is likely that many of the RIs establishedby Patrick and French are inappropriately wide for thispopulation and should not be viewed as transferrable. Oninspection of the RI transference data it can be seen that 12of 19 biochemical RIs showed 100% transference and 9 of 16haematological RIs showed 100% transference. Such highlevels of agreement are likely due to inappropriately wide RIsand according to ASCVP guidelines should be viewed withcaution (Anonymous 2011b). It is noted that the RIs reportedfor many analytes demonstrated signi cant 'narrowing 'of the RIs in this study when compared with the study by French andPatrick (1995). Of particular clinical note when comparing the new donkey RI with that reported previously is a narrowing of thereference intervals for triglycerides with the upper limit of therange being 2.8 mmol/l as compared with the previous4.3 mmol/l. It is very important that veterinarians note thisdifference as this upper limit of triglycerides is commonly usedto determine the risk of a donkey becoming hyperlipaemic;donkeys with plasma triglyceride concentration above thislimit would normally begin treatment to correct an ensuingnegative energy balance. Clinicians should be alert to thefact that, depending on signalment and laboratory methodsused, use of an upper reference limit of 4.3 mmol/l fortriglycerides may not be appropriate and indeed could berisky for the donkey in their care. Notwithstanding effects dueto changes in methods and technology between these UKstudies, it is also likely that there are physiological reasons forthe differences noted. The study by French and Patrick (1995)was based on an admirably large cohort (n =4238); however, both clinically normal and diseased donkeys were included in the study thus greater divergence of the upper and lower limits of the reference intervals could be expected due to the variable effects of disease processes on various parameters. The current study sought to establish appropriate reference values only for clinically healthy donkeys thusindividuals were subjected to stringent clinical checks before inclusion in the study.It is not possible to directly compare the RIs developed in this study with those reported in other studies. Reference intervals generated by different instruments and using variable techniques are not comparable and the differences between the populations studied by others and this cohort are also limiting. Limited comparisons can be made by RI transference validation. This validation was carried out to compare these donkey RIs with those produced for donkeys resident in Mexico (de Aluja et al. 2006) and Ethiopia (Lemma and Moges 2009). Results showed limited transferability between the RIs reported for this population and those reported for working donkeys in Mexico. In particular, many of the RIs reported by de Aluja et al. (2006) were signi cantly narrower than those reported in this study. This is perhaps unsurprising as the population studied was smaller (n =48), had previously been working animals and were kept under different conditions to the cohort used for this study. Determination of transference with haematological RIs established for working donkeys in Ethiopia was limited to a smaller number of analytes reported by the study of Lemma and Moges (2009). Reference intervals transference was possible in 5 out of 6 analytes assessed suggesting that RI transferability was high for these analytes between the 2 RIs. Further work would be useful to determine if transferability is also possible for a wider range of haematological analytesand biochemical analytes. With such a globally ubiquitous species the aspect of relevance of published reference intervals to localpopulations is important. The differences between studiesmay be due to differing diagnostic or storage techniques ormay re flect differences in management and use of the donkeys studied. Best practice dictates that RIs should beestablished for each population encountered by a laboratoryand that transference of RIs between laboratories andcontexts should be undertaken with great caution. Whereestablishment of speci c RIs for donkeys is not possible within a given context, reasons for disparity between 'local 'results and RIs such as those reported here must be borne in mind.For example, in contexts where donkeys are working (Lemmaand Moges 2009; Etana et al. 2011; Girardi et al. 2013), it may be expected that haematological RIs such as haematocrit (calculated PCV) and biochemical parameters such as CPK are effected by work undertaken. Parasitism also likely represents an additional variable in some populations, for example, liver fluke ( Fasciola spp.) is known to be endemic in donkeys in many parts of Ethiopia (Getachew et al. 2010) and may be expected to contribute to the signi cantly higher liver enzymes as reported in other studies (Lemma andMoges 2009; Etana et al. 2011). Gut endoparasite burdens may be responsible for signi cant differences in parameters such as RBC, TP and Eos due to intestinal damage and inflammatory responses and will make transference of RIs challenging in populations with very different parasite challenges. Differences in feeding practices may impact signi cantly, but variably, on RIs and their transference between contexts. For example, markedly high triglyceride levels are reported by Al-Busadah and Homeida (2005) in donkeys fed on a sugar- and fat-rich diet comprising mainly dates, whilst serum creatinine levels could vary with diets rich in protein or in donkeys with more developed muscle mass. Many previously published studies on donkeys have focused on speci c breeds (Folch et 2005; \u00a92015 Donkey Sanctuary. Equine Veterinary Education published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. on behalf of EVJ Ltd.137 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016Girardi et al. 2013) which may not re flect the general donkey population especially when study populations are small; the reference values of Al-Busadah and Homeida (2005) for example were garnered from 13 individuals. In the study by Courouc /C19e-Malblanc et al. (2008) the majority of animals sampled were lactating or heavily pregnant females thus representing a physiologically speci c cohort. The transference of the RIs reported here would undoubtedly beinappropriate to these populations and the establishment ofRIs relevant to speci c populations as those mentioned is bene cial to veterinarians working within the local context; however, such RIs have limited applicability to otherpopulations. Despite the proverbial longevity of donkeys, especially when kept as pets or companions, previous study of age-related effects on their physiology is relatively limited (Zinklet al. 1990; Mot et al. 2011). Changes in physiological parameters according to age are sometimes discussed in published work but the relative longevity of global donkey populations varies and what constitutes 'young ','adult 'and 'aged 'donkeys in such study populations are too inconsistent for valid comparisons to be made (Zinkl et al. 1990; Dinev et al. 2009; Mot et al. 2011). In countries where donkeys are working hard, lifespan tends to be shorter than in animals kept as pets and the complex in fluences of diet, genetics, environment and socioeconomic factors, as well as physical effects (work) on 'ageing 'mean that it is unlikely to be legitimate to extrapolate age-related effects betweenpopulations. Thus studies establishing reference intervals for such populations are not relevant to a broad range of ages. Conversely, the study by French and Patrick (1995) included companion donkeys from the full age range of animal available for study (0 -49 years old) to re flect the pet donkey population in the UK. Although age did not appear to be a signi cant factor in that study the inclusion of immature/ juvenile donkeys with adult/aged animals could be questioned and the current study therefore concentrates on mature adults 4 -24 years old. In view of the longevity of the pet donkey further elucidation of age-appropriate reference intervals throughout their typical lifespan would be of value to veterinarians and is currently being pursued. The Donkey Sanctuary promotes the mantra \"donkeys are different \"and these unique animals should in no way be considered merely as small horses. Notwithstanding variations in sample handling and analysis, in common with previous studies in donkeys (Zinkl et al. 1990; French and Patrick 1995; et al. 2010; Etana et al. 2011) the reference intervals established in the current study appear to be signi cantly different to those recently generated for non-Thoroughbred, adult horses (Anonymous 2011a). When RI transference validation was undertaken with these RIs and those of horses (Anonymous 2011a) only 4 of 20 biochemical analyte RIs and 0 of 16 haematological analyte RIs were transferrable. Notable biochemical differences included signi cantly lower RIs for TBil and Creat and higher RIs for bile acids in the donkey test population compared with those of the sampled non-Thoroughbred horses. Haematological characteristics were markedly different in comparison to the horse reference values, with no RIs established in this study indicating transference with horse RI values. By the inclusion of a largegroup of mature donkeys (n =138) of no speci c breed or physiological demands and of varied sizes, the current studypopulation is intended to re flect the majority of the general UK pet/companion donkey population. This discussion underlines the importance of using relevant and recent reference intervals for clinical assessment of veterinary cases. Conclusions This study establishes reviewed reference intervals forhaematological and biochemical parameters for donkeys.The reference intervals in this study are appropriate for use innonworking, mature donkeys kept in temperate climates andare now used by the diagnostic laboratories of The DonkeySanctuary, UK to aid clinical decision-making in their residentanimals. These reviewed reference intervals also underpincomments appended to results of blood samples fromprivately owned donkeys submitted by veterinarians to thediagnostic laboratory at the Donkey Sanctuary. Thesereference intervals may not be relevant to other donkeypopulations such as working donkeys in tropical regions. Theirextrapolation to animals of extremes of age or in speci c physiological states should also be undertaken with caution.The lack of transferability noted between study parameters indonkeys and horses highlights the importance of usingspecies-appropriate reference intervals for clinical assessmentof veterinary cases.

As dosing regimens are speci c to individual horses and highly variable, it is not possible to establishregulatory guidelines for every dosing scenario and thereforethey are often based on single dose administration studies.The goal of the study described here was to assess theapplicability of current regulatory recommendations for intra-articular corticosteroids based on clinical protocols used bypractitioners. A total of 58 Thoroughbred and 82 Quarter Horseracehorses received varying doses of triamcinoloneacetonide, methylprednisolone acetate, iso flupredone or betamethasone intra-articularly in various joints by the treatingpractitioner. Blood samples were collected at 0, 7, 10, 14, 21,28 and 35 days post drug administration and serum samplesanalysed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry forquantitation of drug concentrations. Serum elimination varieddepending upon the dose and the number and speci c joints treated. Serum concentrations fell below the ARCI threshold guidance by Day 7 (100 pg/ml) for both triamcinolone acetonide (2 -40 mg dose) and iso flupredone acetate (4 - 30 mg dose) and Day 21 (100 pg/ml) for methylprednisoloneacetate (20 -600 mg dose). Betamethasone fell below the regulatory threshold (10 pg/ml) by 7 days for all Quarter Horses and for 7/10 Thoroughbreds studied. Drug concentrations were below the regulatory threshold by Day 10 in the remaining 3 horses receiving betamethasone. Introduction The goal of a medication control programme is to: 1) assurethe health and welfare of animal and human participants, 2)assure a fair and level playing eld for all competitors and 3) safeguard the public interest with anti-doping regulations wherever sanctioned wagering is involved. Over the last few years, there has been an international effort to address the use of therapeutic medications commonly used in racing, including corticosteroids. Historically, regulation of horse racing in the United States (US) was on a state-by-state basis and it was up to speci c jurisdictions to establish regulatory recommendations. Additionally, most regulations were established well before simulcasting and interstate wageringwas legal. In spite of sporadic efforts at uniformity over the last several years, there were considerable variations between state medication and drug regulations and how those regulations are administered. In 2001, a meeting of national industry stakeholders, sponsored by the American Association of Equine Practitioners, led to the establishment of the Racing Medication and Testing Consortium (RMTC). The RMTC was tasked with promoting national uniformity with respect to medication regulations. The result has been a cooperative effort within the racehorse industry to develop a national uniform medication programme (NUMP) by establishing regulatory thresholds and withdrawal time guidance for a limited number of therapeutic medications. Whenever feasible, the preference in the US is to regulate therapeutic medications in blood (serum or plasma). This effort has been spearheaded by the RMTC through drug administration research and subsequent recommendations to the Association of Racing Commissioners International (ARCI). The ARCI represents the majority of the 38 separate racing authorities in the US and maintains the Model Rules for racing in the US (ARCI Model Rules, https://ua-rtip.org/industry_ service/download_model_rules). All states in which racing occurs are encouraged, but not required, to adopt the Model Rules. Corticosteroids are potent anti-in flammatory agents and, as such, are commonly used to treat performance-related musculoskeletal injuries and other in flammatory conditions in equine athletes. In the US, they are currently classi ed by the ARCI as Class 4 foreign substances with a penalty category C (ARCI Model Rules). Due to their potent anti-in flammatory effects, corticosteroid use close to competition is of particular concern to regulatory authorities because of the potential to mask injuries that may otherwise keep a horse from racing. Regulatory thresholds and withdrawal time guidance are typically based on carefully controlled studies, utilising a single dose commonly used by veterinary practitioners. While necessary for establishment of regulatory guidance, this type of study does not necessarily re flect how corticosteroid drugs are typically used in clinical racecourse practice. In the case of corticosteroids, selection of a 'common dose 'becomes more problematic, as the use pattern of this class of drugs is highly variable between practitioners (Ferris et al. 2011). Current NUMP regulatory thresholds for triamcinolone acetonide VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016100 pg/ml, based on a single intra-articular dose of 9 mg TCA(Knych et al . 2013) and 100 mg MPA (Knych et al. 2014). The corresponding withdrawal time guidance is 7 and 21 days forTCA and MPA, respectively. For betamethasone, theregulatory threshold concentration and withdrawal timeguidance is 10 pg/ml and 7 days, respectively based on asingle intra-articular dose of 9 mg (Anon 2014). Forisoflupredone acetate (IPA), a regulatory threshold concentration of 100 pg/ml, with a withdrawal time guidance of 7 days, is recommended (Benson et al. 2014). These recommended regulatory thresholds were establishedbased on practical horseracing and racehorse managementand not necessarily based on pharmacodynamic ortherapeutic considerations. Since the withdrawal timeguidance for each drug was based on single dose studiesand in the majority of cases practitioners use combinationcorticosteroid therapy, widely varying doses and treatmultiple joints to most effectively treat their patients, the goalof the study described here was to assess the applicability ofthe ARCI regulatory guidance for each corticosteroidfollowing intra-articular (IA) administration of various clinicalprotocols employed by racecourse practitioners. Materials and methods Horse selection Fifty-eight Thoroughbred (TB) and 82 Quarter Horse (QH)racehorses were studied. Horse selection as well as thespeci c corticosteroid, doses administered and joints to be treated were determined by the treating practitioner as partof their clinical evaluation of each animal. For the TB portionof the study, 18 horses received TCA (Vetalog; Kenalog) 1,2, (maximum cumulative dose of 9 -18 mg), 21 horses received MPA (Depo-Medrol)3(maximum cumulative dose of 40 - 600 mg), 7 horses received IPA (Predef 2X)3(maximum cumulative dose of 4 -18 mg) and 12 horses received betamethasone (Celestone; Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate and Betamethasone Acetate)4,5, (maximum cumulative dose of 12 -60 mg) IA in various joints. Quarter Horses received varying combinations of corticosteroids IAinto various joints including: 1) betamethasone (12 -24 mg), 2) IPA (4 -26 mg) +betamethasone (12 -42 mg), 3) MPA (40 mg) +betamethasone (24 mg), 4) TCA (10 -20 mg) + betamethasone (6 -12 mg), 5) TCA (10-24 mg) +IPA (2- 20 mg) +betamethasone (6 -36 mg), 6) MPA (20 -40 mg) + IPA (5-30 mg) +TCA (10 -40 mg) +betamethasone (6 - 30 mg), 7) TCA (2 -20 mg) +MPA (20 -40 mg) +IPA (8 - 25 mg) and 8) TCA (20 -40 mg) +MPA (20 -40 mg) + betamethasone (18 -30 mg). Details regarding the speci c drug administered, manufacturer, dose, joints treated, dose time, concurrent IA administration of other compounds as well as treatment with IA or intramuscular (i.m.) corticosteroids in the preceding 30 or 60 days, respectively were recorded. All drug administrations were conducted bythe treating practitioner. Blood samples were collected by direct venipuncture at 0, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28 and 35 (MPA only) days post drug administration from TBs and 0, 7 and 10 days post administration from QH. All samples were collected by the treating practitioner into serum separator tubes 6. Sample collection, storage at the racetrack and shipping procedures were comparable to the processes for post race sample collection. Samples were centrifuged at the racetrack at3300 revolutions/min (RPM) and refrigerated prior to being shipped to the laboratory. Upon receipt at the laboratory, samples were centrifuged again at 3000 RPM for 10 min and serum immediately transferred into storage cryovials.7All samples were stored at /C020\u00b0C (approximately 2 weeks) until analysed by tandem liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for quantitation serum methylprednisolone (MP), TCA, iso flupredone (IP) and betamethasone concentrations using previously validated assays used for post race drug testing (Knych et al. 2013, 2014, 2015). Results Thoroughbred study Of the 58 TBs included in the study, 6 received MPA, 3 receivedisoflupredone and one received TCA IA within 30 days prior to enrolment in the study. Of these, only one horse that had received MPA had a baseline concentration (520 pg/ml)exceeding the regulatory threshold. Three horses received TCA and 3 horses received MPA as an i.m. injection within 60 days of commencement of the study. Serum baseline concentrations were below the regulatory threshold for all 3 horses. Table 1 lists the time at which serum concentrations of TCA, MP, IP and betamethasone fell below the ARCI regulatorythreshold in the TB horses. The elimination time varied based onthe maximum dose administered, speci c joints injected as well as the total number of joints treated. Methylprednisoloneacetate concentrations were below the regulatory thresholdconcentration in all horses by Day 21 post administration.Serum concentrations fell below the ARCI regulatory thresholdby Day 7 (100 pg/ml) for both TCA (9 -18 mg dose) and IPA (4 - 18 mg dose). For betamethasone, 7 of 10 horses had serum concentrations below the regulatory threshold (10 pg/ml) by 7 days post administration. Serum betamethasone concentrations in the remaining 3 horses fell below the regulatory threshold by Day 10 post drug administration. Concurrently administered IA medications included hyaluronic acid (HA) (17 horses) and a HA, sodium chondroitin sulfate and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine combination product (Polyglycan) 8(7 horses) ( Table 2 ). Of the 3 horses in which betamethasone concentrations exceeded the regulatory regulatory threshold at 7 days post administration, one had received 30 mg and 2 had received 60 mg of betamethasone. All 3 horses also received IA Polyglycan (2.5 -5 ml) concurrent with betamethasone administration ( Table 2 ). Quarter Horse study Of the 82 QHs studied, 57 received MPA, 2 receivedbetamethasone, 2 received TCA and one received IPA IAwithin 30 days of commencement of the study. Nineteen ofthe 57 that received an IA MPA injection in the previous30 days had serum MP concentrations at or above theregulatory threshold (100 pg/ml). No TCA or IP was detectedin baseline samples from horses reported as receiving eitherdrug in the preceding 30 days. A total of 13 horses receivedan i.m. injection of either MPA (10 horses), TCA (2 horses) orIPA (one horse) within 60 days prior to enrolment in the study.Of these horses, 5 had MP serum concentrations that were100 ng/ml in baseline samples with 4 of these animals also having received an IA injection of MPA within the preceding30 days. The time at which concentrations fell below theARCI regulatory threshold for combination IA corticosteroid \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd141 VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / to QH, are listed in Table 3 . Serum concentrations fell below the threshold (100 pg/ml) by Day 7for both TCA (2 -40 mg dose) and IPA (2 -30 mg dose) administration. For betamethasone (12 -42 mg), all horses had serum concentrations below the regulatory threshold (10 pg/ ml) by 7 days post administration. Following administration of MPA (9 -40 mg), serum concentrations were below the regulatory threshold (100 pg/ml) by Day 10 post administration. Discussion The goal of the current study was to assess the applicabilityof current regulatory thresholds and withdrawal timeguidance for the most commonly administered IAcorticosteroids following the use of a variety of clinicaldosing regimens. Current regulatory guidance for the use ofIA corticosteroids in racehorses are based upon studies of asingle dose administered in a single joint. It is not possible tostudy every corticosteroid dosing regimen employed byveterinary practitioners, but this study provides veterinarypractitioners with threshold compliance information on abroad and clinically relevant variety of corticosteroidtreatments.In the presently reported study, TCA serum concentrations fell below the regulatory threshold (100 pg/ml) by 7 days post intra-articular administration at all doses studied. This was true whether TCA was administered as the sole treatment or in combination with other corticosteroids. This is in agreement with previous studies (Soma et al. 2011; Knych et al. 2013) describing the administration of 9 mg (Knych et al. 2013) or 20-30 mg (Soma et al. 2011) of TCA into a single antebrachiocarpal joint. Similarly, following administration of 6 mg of TCA into both tarsometatarsal joints (total dose of12 mg), serum concentrations were less than 100 pg/ml by 7 days post administration (Knych et al. 2011). Although its use is somewhat controversial (McIlwraith 2010), MPA is arguably one of the more commonly usedTABLE 1: Time at which corticosteroid concentrations fell below the ARCI regulatory threshold following administration of various clinical doses of triamcinolone acetonide, methylprednisolone acetate, iso flupredone acetate and betamethasone to a total of 58 Thoroughbred racehorses Drug Dose range (mg) No. jointsTime until below ARCI regulatory threshold Day 7 Day 10 Day 14 Day 17 Day 21 Methylprednisolone acetate (n =24) 80 1 1/1 Isoflupredone acetate =7) 2/2 10-16 Betamethasone (n =10) 30 -60 2 7/10 10/10 TABLE 2: Time at which corticosteroid concentrations fell below the ARCI regulatory threshold when administered in combinationwith other noncorticosteroid intra-articular medications toThoroughbred racehorses CorticosteroidNo. jointsDose below RCI proposed threshold Hyaluronic acid (22 mg)MPA 2 40 -80 Day 7 (4/4) 4 160 Day 10 (1/1) TCA 2 12 Day 7 (9/9)Betamethasone 2 12 Day 7 (3/3) Polyglycan (2.5-3 ml)Betamethasone 2 30 Day 7 (3/4) Day 10 (4/4) Polyglycan (5 ml)Betamethasone 2 60 Day 10 (2/2) Polyglycan (3-4 ml)TCA 1 9 Day 7 (1/1) 2 18 Day 7 (1/1)TABLE 3: Time at which corticosteroid concentrations fell belowthe ARCI regulatory threshold following administration of variouscombinations of clinical doses of triamcinolone acetonide,methylprednisolone acetate, betamethasone and iso flupredone acetate to a total of 82 Quarter Horse racehorses DrugsDose range (mg)Time until below RCI regulatory threshold Day 7 Day 10 Betamethasone (n =3) 12 -24 3/3 / MARCH 2016corticosteroid formulations in performance horses (Ferris et al. 2011). While the high lipid solubility of this formulation providesa prolonged local anti-in flammatory effect, it also leads to an increased residence time within the joint and a longer serumor plasma detection time, relative to more solublecompounds (Knych et al . 2014). Similar to previous reports (Autefage et al. 1986; Lillich et al. 1996; Soma et 2006; Menendez et al. 2012; Knych et al . 2014), in the current study, higher systemic concentrations were observed with increasing doses of MPA, including one horse receiving 600 mg which was 200 mg more than the next highest MPA cumulative dose (400 mg). However, in all studies, including the presently reported one, systemic concentrations fell below the regulatory threshold by 21 days post drug administration. In order to avoid inadvertent positive regulatory ndings, it is prudent to be sensitive to previous corticosteroid administration. As was demonstrated in thecurrent study, this is especially necessary in the case ofprevious MPA administration, as serum concentrationsexceeded the regulatory threshold in a number of QHspreviously treated with MPA. This is likely due to the longerresidence time of this drug compared with other commonlyused IA corticosteroids in horses. There are limited published reports describing the clearance of iso flupredone following IA administration to horses (Lillich et al. 1996; Benson et al. 2014; Knych et al. 2015). In the study by Lillich et al. (1996), detectable concentrations of IP and IPA equivalents were reported foronly 12 and 72 h, respectively following IA administration of 4 mg. More recent studies utilising more sensitive LC-MS/MS methods, reported that plasma iso flupredone concentrations fell below the regulatory threshold by 36 (Knych et al. 2015) and 72 h (Benson et al. 2014) post IA administration of 8 and 20 mg of IP, respectively. In the current study, regardless of the dose administered or the joint treated, serum IP concentrations fell below the ARCI regulatory threshold by the suggested withdrawal time guidance of 7 days. The results of previous studies as well as the presently reported one suggest that a 7 day withdrawal time guidance is adequate for IA administration of IPA at doses up to 30 mg. The most commonly used intra-articular betamethasone product in horses is a combination betamethasone sodium phosphate/betamethasone acetate formulation. Current regulatory recommendations are based on an unpublished administration study whereby 20 horses received a single IA dose of 9 mg of betamethasone sodium phosphate/ betamethasone acetate (Anon 2014). The position statement reports plasma concentrations below the limit of quantitation (5 pg/ml) by 5 days post administration. Based on this, a regulatory recommendation of a 10 pg/ml threshold concentration with a corresponding 7 day withdrawal time was made. To the best of the authors 'knowledge, there is only one published report describing the pharmacokinetics of betamethasone following IA administration to horses (Menendez et al. 2015); however, the LOQ (50 pg/ml) in that study is well above the current regulatory threshold (10 pg/ ml) and therefore it is dif cult to use this study in the assessment of the ARCI withdrawal time guidance. In the current study, the dose of betamethasone administered ranged from 6 -60 mg. The majority of the horses studied had serum concentrations below 10 pg/ml by 7 days; however, 3 of the TB horses had levels above 10 pg/ml until 10 days postadministration (the next time point sampled). These 3 horses were at the upper end of the dose range (30 mg [one horse]; 60 mg [2 horses]) and interestingly all had received IA Polyglycan. It is not possible from the data in this study to make any inferences as to whether the prolonged detection is due to concurrent Polyglycan administration or simply high dose betamethasone administration, as a limited number of horses received this combination. However, until this potential interaction is more extensively studied, it may be prudent to observe an extended withdrawal time when administering high doses of betamethasone, whether in combination with Polyglycan or by itself. It is important to note that the ARCI recommended withdrawal time guidance, as well as the results presented here apply only to IA corticosteroid administration and not administration by other routes. Other routes of administration, intramuscular in particular, necessitate a prolonged withdrawal time. As an example, Soma et al. (2011) have reported systemic concentrations of TCA above the regulatory threshold for upwards of 10 days, following i.m. administration of a 0.04 mg/kg dose. Higher doses and other non-IA routes of any of the corticosteroids studied here may require an even more prolonged withdrawal time to avoid inadvertent positive regulatory ndings. Veterinarians should be aware that extravasation into subcutaneous tissues or inadvertent extra- articular injection during an intended IA injection may also necessitate a prolonged withdrawal time. Although serum elimination varied depending on the dose and number of joints treated, based on the results of this study, maximum IA cumulative doses of 40 mg of TCA, 600 mg of MPA and 30 mg of IPA, either by themselves or in combination with other corticosteroids, should not result in positive regulatory ndings if the ARCI withdrawal time guidance is followed for each drug. In the case of IA betamethasone administration, results of this study suggest that doses less than 30 mg should not result in excess of the regulatory threshold, when following the ARCI recommended withdrawal time guidance. However, based on the ndings reported here, doses of 30 mg or greater may necessitate an extended withdrawal time as serum concentrations did not fall below the regulatory threshold until 10 days post administration. It should be noted that as the present study examined corticosteroid serum levels only and did not assess urine levels that extrapolating withdrawal time guidance in racing authorities where corticosteroids are regulated in urine may not be appropriate.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION For Intra-Articular (I.A.) Use in Horses. CONTRAINDICATIONS: BetaVet\u00ae is contraindicated with hypersensitivity to betamethasone. Intra-articular injection of corticosteroids for local effect is contraindicated in the presence of septic arthritis. WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally to animals may induce the first stage of parturition when administered during the last trimester of pregnancy and may precipitate premature par turition followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis. Additionally, corticosteroids administered to dogs, rabbits and rodents during pregnancy have resulted in cleft palate in offspring and in other congenital anomalies including deformed forelegs, phocomelia and anasarc a. Therefore, before use of corticosteroids in pregnant animals, the possible benefits to the pregnant animal should be weighed against potential hazards to its developing embryo or fetus. Human Warnings: Not for use in humans. For use in animals only. Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in the case of accidental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: Corticosteroids, including BetaVet \u00ae, administered intra-articularly are systemically absorbed. Do not use in horses with acute infections. Acute moderate to severe exacerbation of pain, further loss of joint motion, fever, or malaise within several days following intra-articular injection may indicate a septic process. Because of the anti-inflammator y action of corticosteroids, signs of infection in the treated joint may be masked. Due to the potential for exacerbation of clinical signs of laminitis, glucocorticoids should be used with caution in horses with a history of laminitis, or horses otherwise at a higher risk for laminitis. Use with caution in horses with chronic nephritis, equine pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID), and congestive heart failure. Concurrent use of other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs or other corticosteroids, should be approached with caution. Due to the potential for systemic exposure, concomitant use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids may increase the risk of gastrointestinal, renal, and other toxicity. Consider appropriate wash out times prior to administering additional NSAIDs or corticosteroids. ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse reactions reported during a field study of 239 horses of various breeds which had been administered either BetaVet \u00ae (n=119) or a saline control (n=120) at five percent (5%) and above were: acute joint effusion and/or local injection site swelling (within 2 days of injection), 15% BetaVet \u00ae and 13% saline saline control. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Shake well immediately before use. Use immediately after opening, then discard any remaining contents. RX ONLY References: 1. Houdeshell, JW.

Depending upon their physico-chemical properties, drugs administered intra-articularly may enter the general circulation because the synovial joint cavity is in direct equilibrium with the surrounding blood supply. After the intra-articular administration of 9 mg BetaVet \u00ae in horses, there were quantifiable concentrations of betamethasone (above 1.0 ng/mL) in the plasma. EFFECTIVENESS: A negative control, randomized, masked field study provided data to evaluate the effectiveness of BetaVet \u00ae administered at 1.5 mL (9 mg betamethasone) once intra-articularly for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in horses. Clinical success was defined as improvement in one lameness grade according to the AAEP lameness scoring system on Day 5 following treatment. The success rate for horses in the BetaVet \u00ae group was statistically significantly different (p=0.0061) than that in the saline group, with success rates of 75.73% and 52.52%, respectively (back-transformed from the logistic regression). ANIMAL SAFETY: A 3-week target animal safety (TAS) study was conducted to evaluate the safety of BetaVet \u00ae in mature, healthy horses. Treatment groups included a control (isotonic saline at a volume equivalent to the pound bodyweight; BetaVet\u00ae). Treatments were administered by intra-articular injection into the left middle carpal joint once every 5-days for 3 treatments. Injection site reactions were the most common observations in all treatment groups. Injection site reactions were observed within 1 hour of dosing and included swelling at the injection site, lameness/stiffness of the left front limb, and flexing the left front knee at rest. The injection site reactions ranged from slight swelling (in many horses on multiple days in all treatment groups) to excessive fluid with swelling, pain, and lameness (4x group only). Injection site reactions were observed most commonly on treatment days, and generally decreased in number and severity over subsequent days. The incidence of injection site reactions increased after the second and third injection (number of abnormalities noted on day 10 > day 5 > day 0). In the BetaVet \u00ae treated groups the number and severity of the injection site reactions were dose dependent. The 4X BetaVet\u00ae group had the highest overall incidence of and severity of injection site reactions, which included heat, swelling, pain, bleeding, and holding the limb up at rest. The control group and 4X group (which received similar injection volumes) had a similar incidence of injection site reactions; however, the severity of reactions was greater in the 4X group. Absolute neutrophils were statistically significantly higher in the BetaVet \u00ae treated groups as compared to the control group. Trends toward a decrease in lymphocytes and eosinophils, and an increase in monocytes were identified in the BetaVet \u00ae treated groups after the initial dose of BetaVet\u00ae. Individual animal values for white blood cells generally remained within the reference range. BetaVet \u00ae treated horses also had a trend toward increased blood glucose after the initial dose. Some individual animals showed mild increases in blood glucose above the reference range.

Keywords: acute phase protein; neonate Summary This study investigated the immediate (6 h or less) effects ofbrinogen and albumin contained in transfused equine origin fresh frozen plasma on those proteins when measured in sickneonatal foals. Fibrinogen and albumin concentrations weremeasured in the administered plasma and in 31 sick foals atadmission to a referral neonatal intensive care unit.Additional samples were obtained from the foals at 2 and 6 hfollowing transfusion. No changes in albumin concentrationwere recognised. The main determinant of brinogen concentration following transfusion was the concentration ofbrinogen in the foal at admission. Importantly, intravenous transfusion of equine fresh frozen plasma did not result inimmediate (6 h or less) increases or decreases in thebrinogen concentration in the recipient foals. Fibrinogen from the donor contained within transfused plasma will notdirectly affect brinogen concentrations measured at later times. Introduction Transfusions of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) are frequentlyadministered to healthy foals as treatment for failure ofpassive transfer or as prophylaxis for Rhodococcus equi infection and to critically ill 1994; Gigu /C18ere et al. 2002, 2011). Little is known regarding the effect on the plasma concentrations of the other components oftransfused FFP in healthy or critically ill foals. Fibrinogen (FIB) isa plasma protein component that is frequently monitored incritically ill foals as a measure of the acute in flammatory response and as an indicator of response to treatment.Fibrinogen concentration ([FIB]) normally increases from birthto age 4 -7 days, when it reaches mature values (Barton et al. 1995). Increasing or increased [FIB] is found in cases withinflammation and infection while decreasing [FIB] is thought to occur with resolution of in flammation or infection. Fibrinogen concentration monitoring is used to determineefcacy of treatment of patients with in flammatory disease, in conjunction with other clinical parameters, and can play akey role in guiding case management.Fresh frozen plasma contains, amongst other clotting factors and proteins, FIB from the donor animal. It is currently unknown whether the FIB contained in the administered FFP affects the recipient foal 's [FIB], potentially confounding the interpretation of changes in [FIB]. The speci c aim of the study was to investigate the immediate (within 6 h) effect of FFP transfusion on [FIB] and albumin concentration ([ALB]) in critically hypothesised of equine FFP to critically ill equine neonates will cause changes in the recipient 's plasma [FIB] proportional to the [FIB] of the administered plasma. Albumin concentration was concurrently assessed because it is present in plasma at a larger concentration, has a longer half-life and should be less affected by acute changes in the in flammatory status of the foal. Materials and methods Animals Consecutively admitted critically ill neonatal foals (age<2 weeks) of various breeds and either gender, admitted for evaluation and treatment and receiving commerciallyavailable equine origin FFP as a part of their treatment, wereenrolled following informed owner consent. All procedureswere approved by the Institutional Animal Care and UseCommittee. Study design This was an observational prospective clinical study. Fresh frozen plasma Commercially available equine origin FFP was storedaccording to the instructions of the manufacturer (HiGamm-Equi) a. Frozen plasma was thawed slowly in warm water baths immediately prior to administration. Each lot of plasma was assayed for albumin and brinogen concentrations prior to administration, using citrated plasma sample(s) provided by the manufacturer. Plasma lots are prepared by collection of a single large volume from one horse that is thoroughly mixed. We had previously established that there was excellent correlation ( R2=0.97; P <0.001) between [ALB] measured in citrated or heparinised plasma (data not shown) allowing us to use the provided citrated plasma samples to determine [ALB] and [FIB] in the administered plasma. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd145 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016Fresh frozen plasma administration Fresh frozen plasma was administered at the discretion of theattending veterinarian as part of the treatment plan for eachfoal. No effort was made to standardise timing of FFPadministration following patient admission or rates andcomposition of i.v. administered isotonic crystalloid fluids. FFP transfusion was performed using a i.v. administration set anda continuous i.v. fluid infusion pump (Alaris Gemini IV) b. After an initial observation period, the administration rate wouldthen be increased if no reaction had occurred. Transfusionduration was not recorded. Sample acquisition Admission blood samples were obtained during i.v. catheterplacement at the time of admission (Arrow Central VenousCatheter) c. The whole blood sample was distributed as routine aliquots into multiple glass blood tubes with a variety of anticoagulants, including a 3.2% citrate tube used for this study. Additional whole blood samples were obtained at 2 and 6 h following completion of the FFP transfusion by direct venipuncture or by aspiration through the i.v. catheter after withdrawal of an appropriate presample and placed in 3.2%citrated tubes. slide technique; Vitros 350 Chemistry System)e concentrations were routinely measured by the hospitalclinical pathology laboratory.

Discussion The results of this study show that [FIB] in commerciallyproduced equine FFP should not impact [FIB] foals following FFP transfusion to a clinically signi cant extent in the immediate post-transfusion period. If longer-termeffects on [FIB] foalare found, they are very unlikely to be not a direct consequence of the [FIB] of the administered FFP.However, the immediate (within ~6 h) impact of FFP transfusion on both [FIB] and [ALB] was not readilypredictable in an individual sick foal ( Fig 1 ). The data set was also investigated more closely using 2 groups that had either increased or decreased [FIB] at the 2 h sample time following transfusion when compared to admission [FIB] by evaluating the percent change in [FIB] over that and the subsequent 6 h sample time ( Table 2 ). The percent change was utilised due to the large range of [FIB] in the foals of the study. Foals having decreased [FIB] at the 2 h sample time had higher [FIB] at admission when compared to foals that had an increase in [FIB] at the 2 h sample time, suggesting that, in those foals, FIB had been diluted in the foal 's vascular space or that FIB had been consumed. Physiological (post gestational age related) and pathophysiological (dehydration, haemorrhage, septic shock) responses affecting the intravascular volume of the sick foal may result in changes in [FIB] and [ALB] (Brace 1998; Palmer 2004). Additionally, normal neonatal foals have substantially larger fluid volumes relative to their body mass than do mature horses (Fielding et al. 2011). Large fluid volumes might be required for volume expansion in sick foals, but the proportion of the administered fluids ultimately retained in the vascular space might be small. Very fast rates of i.v. crystalloid fluid administration, and large volumes, would have been required in some foals in this report to restore perfusion and could effectively dilute existing FIB. An additional cocontributor to decreased [FIB] could be disease severity. A near 2-fold increase in FIB degradation, with unchanged FIB synthesis, has been described after 4 -6ho f induced acidaemia in pigs (Martini and Holcomb 2007). Whilesevere acidaemia is uncommon, except in very ill foals, some foals might have been signi cantly acidaemic at admission.Coagulopathy, resulting in FIB loss, is relatively common in critically ill foals and could also contribute to decreased [FIB] (Cotovio et al. 2008; Bentz et al. 2009; Dallap-Schaer et al. 2009). Recently normal foals younger than 24 h were shown to have a blood volume of ~160 ml/kg bwt with a plasma volume of ~100 ml/kg bwt (Fielding et al. 2011), similar to values reported for 2 -day -old foals in earlier studies (Persson and Ullberg 1979; Spensley et al. 1987). The normal, prototypic 50 kg foal would therefore have a circulating blood volume of 8 l with a 5 l plasma volume. Addition of one litre of FFP would theoretically expand the plasma volume by up to 20% and, should [FIB] Plasma be lower than [FIB] Foal, effectively dilute [FIB] Foal. Similarly, i.v. administration of large volumes (2 -4 l) of crystalloid fluids to a hypotensive and/or hypovolaemic foal would dilute Foal, effectively potential increase in [FIB] Foal due to FFP administration in the immediate (6 h or less) post transfusion period. Most neonatal foals with critical illness present at age 1-3 days, making these fluid volumes relevant to our case population (Borchers et al. 2012) Some foals had increased [FIB] at one or both sample times following transfusion, relative to admission. Post-FFPadministration increases in [FIB] suggest addition of FIB to the vascular space, possibly due to endogenous production in response to the primary disease process, or to transfused FIB followed by translocation of any added free water to the interstitial space, effectively concentrating brinogen in the vascular space. Coordinated transcription of 3 brinogen genes is upregulated 2- to 10-fold in response to stimuli including in flammation, infection and tissue injury, mainly by interleukin-6 and glucocorticoid signalling pathways (Gabay and Kushner 1999; Redman and Xia 2001). Although brinogen has been considered an acute phase reactant protein, values generally increase only moderately at 24 h after induction of in flammation and might not peak for 2 - 3 days in the horse (Shalm 1979; Jacobsen et al. 2005; Pollock et al. 2005; Borges et al. 2007). The kinetics of brinogen synthesis make it unlikely that FIB produced de novo as a result of FFP transfusion in the foal resulted in important increases in [FIB] within the time frame of the study. That stated, steady production resulting from existing stimulation was likely to be a contributor to some observed [FIB]TABLE 2: Percent change in brinogen concentration ([FIB]) between sampling times Admission to 2 h % changeAdmission to 6 h % change2ht o6h % change Fibrinogen 6.8) (8) Foals were sampled at the time of admission to the hospital (Admission) and at 2 h and 6 h following completion of plasma transfusion and grouped as having increased or decreased [FIB] at 2 h post transfusion. Results are presented as Median (25 -75th interquartile range) (n =number of foals). Differences in percent [FIB] were tested using Kruskal -Wallis. Statistical signi cance was set at P0.05. * Signi cant differences were found from admission to 2 h and admission to 6 h between foals that had increased brinogen concentration at 2 h compared to admission (increased group) vs. foals that had decreased brinogen concentration at 2 h compared to admission (decreased group). This difference between the 'increased 'and 'decreased 'groups was not present when evaluated between groups for the 2 -6 h period. Admission to 2 h P =0.001; admission to 6 h P =0.003; 2 h to 6 h P =0.268. No signi cant differences were found between sampling periods when all foals were considered. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd147 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION post-FFP transfusion, particularly in foals with well-established disease. Differences in both directions, increased or decreased [FIB] relative to admission, were of greater magnitude andmore frequent between groups at 2 h than at 6 h posttransfusion ( Table 2 ). In fact, by inspection over all foals, there was small negative percentage of change in [FIB] from admission at 6 h, supporting the premise that any observed changes were due to either treatment or disease processes inherent in the foal, not due to FFP transfusion. This is also supported by the observation the [FIB] in the foal at admission was the major determinant of post transfusion [FIB] ( Fig 2 ). The reasons for any observed differences are unde ned, in part due to study limitations, but in some cases the differences were large enough potentially to impact case management, if brinogenconcentration were measured at unusually short intervals, with FIB kinetics and effects of i.v. fluid administration not being considered. Albumin concentrations have been reported as relatively constant in foals for the rst 3 months of life, increasing to mature concentrations by age one year (Rose et al. 1979; Rumbaugh and Adamson 1983). Albumin is a primary determinant of colloid osmotic pressure, with Thoroughbred foals having lower measured colloid osmotic pressure than mature horses (Landis and Pappenheimer 1963; Runk et al. 2000). We had anticipated that [ALB] would be a useful comparative protein to investigate the impact of FFP transfusion on [FIB], using the [FIB]:[ALB] ratio, but this did not prove to be the case, possibly due to the 5- to 10-fold larger [ALB] obscuring any potential but relatively smaller changes in [FIB] and its effect on colloid osmotic pressure, drawing water into the vascular space. This study could have been improved by controlling timing of FFP transfusion relative to admission and by carefully recording times and volumes of additional crystalloid administration. More complete recording of admission and subsequent clinical pathology data, including blood gas analyses, might have allowed for more detailed query of the results and should be considered in any subsequent studies of this topic in sick foals. Using samples obtained immediately prior to FFP transfusion rather than blood samples obtained at admission would have limited the variability present in our resultsassociated with treatment prior to institution of FFP transfusion and should be considered in future studies. However, we believe that this study does provide answers to questions related to the potential for acute (6 h or less) clinically important changes in [FIB] associated with FFP transfusion: minimal changes will be observed, generally of low magnitude and in unpredictable directions, and should not interfere with the use of [FIB] as a monitoring tool in sick equine neonates. Importantly, any observed changes in the time frame of this study could not be related to [FIB] of the transfused FFP and were more likely to be associated with underlying disease and administration of other i.v. fluids. In summary, i.v. transfusion of equine FFP did not result in important acute changes in [FIB] in the recipient foals. Observed changes in [FIB] in the foals of this report were not of a magnitude that should interfere with monitoring of [FIB] as an indicator of response to treatment, particularly if performed at more appropriate intervals of approximately 48 h. This study did not investigate the impact of FFP transfusion on other indicators of in flammation or on inflammatory mediators in these foals, a potentially interesting and clinically relevant question.

A. testes may reduce patient morbidity and speedrecovery compared with traditional laparotomy becauseanaesthesia is avoided and skin incisions are smaller. Reliablylocating the testis preoperatively is therefore optimal to avoidunnecessary surgical morbidity and expense. We describeand review the results of a simple method of location usingultrasound scanning of the inguinal region, with a negativeresult indicating abdominal retention. One hundred andtwenty-seven horses with 141 cryptorchid testes wereidenti ed. Eighty- 56 abdominal. Two inguinally retained testes were not observed on ultrasound (false negatives) and 2 testes were considered inguinal but subsequently had to be removed from the abdomen (false positives). Sensitivity of inguinal ultrasound to predict the location of cryptorchid testes was therefore 98% and speci city 97%. The technique described herein proved a reliable technique to locate cryptorchid testes prior to surgery,minimising morbidity and cost. Suspect cryptorchids with no external evidence of testes should undergo a screening blood test prior to this ultrasound method of diagnosis. Introduction Cryptorchid, literally meaning 'hidden testis ', occurs when one or both testes fail to descend from the abdomen into the scrotum (Law 1923). Affected animals have a variety of colloquial names, including rig, ridgling and original .A s cryptorchidism is variously considered heritable (Stout 2013), affected horses are regarded as genetically unsound and cannot be used for breeding by most organisations (Haynes 1986). Castration is necessary to abolish the adverse behavioural characteristics in these animals and this procedure is more technically demanding than routine castration. Traditionally, the inguinal area is searched rst before moving to the abdominal cavity (Cox et al. 1975). Laparoscopy offers signi cant advantages over traditional laparotomy approaches, including improved visualisation, reduced patient morbidity through smaller incisions and a more rapid post operative recovery (Fischer and Vachon 1993). Recent data have questioned this premise. Laparoscopic cryptorchidecomy carried out under general anaesthesia was found to have signi cantly longer surgery times and experienced higher rates of post operative complicationcompared with traditional open surgery (Cribb et al. 2015). Laparoscopy can also be carried out under standing sedation, avoiding the increased morbidity and cost associated withgeneral anaesthesia (Hendrickson and Wilson 1997) as well as facilitating nding the testis during surgery (Hendrickson 2002). No objective published data currently exist comparing standing laparoscopic with traditional techniques, but with signi cant experience of both, it is the current authors ' experience that standing laparoscopic cryptorchidectomy is a rapid technique with few complications. Ascertaining the location of hidden testes, especially prior to making a standing approach, minimises the surgical morbidity and cost of cryptorchid castration. In bilateral cryptorchid horses where the possibility of previous surgery exists, active testicular tissue is rst identi ed using a hormonal assay (Cox et al. 1986). In these and in unilateral cryptorchids, the location of the missing testis can then be ascertained by rectal examination (Cox et al. 1986), by ultrasound examination per rectum (Jann and Rains 1990) or per cutaneous (Schambourg et al. 2006). Rectal examination may be dangerous and/or impossible in ponies; however, the percutaneous technique is appropriate in most cases. It isthese authors 'experience that reliably visualising and locating an abdominal testis using a previously described percutaneous technique is more dif cult than described (Schambourg et al. 2006). Therefore, we simpli ed the technique to scan only the inguinal region; absence of a testis was considered to indicate abdominal retention. It is the purpose of this paper to describe this simpli ed technique and its results when applied to cryptorchid horses presented to 3 hospitals for castration. Materials and methods Horses presented for cryptorchid castration at 3 equinereferral hospitals between June 2008 and January 2015 wereidenti ed retrospectively and case records reviewed. Imaging technique Inguinal ultrasound examination was carried out in all caseson initial presentation. Heavy sedation was induced usingintravenous administration of a routine a2-agonist and opiate drug combination. Horses were restrained in stocks and aninitial manual palpation of the scrotal and inguinal regionwas carried out. The skin in this area was liberally soaked withpropanol or surgical spirit for ultrasound coupling. Theultrasound probe was applied to the inguinal area in alongitudinal orientation ( Fig 1 ): three authors used a 2 -4 MHz curvilinear ultrasound probe set at 8 cm ( Fig 2 ) depth; one author used an 8 -13 MHz linear probe set at 6 cm depth (Fig 3 ). The scrotal and connective tissue abaxial to the penile shaft and external to super cial inguinal ring were \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd150 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION AE / MARCH 2016systematically examined. Testicles have a characteristicappearance, with a uniform grey stroma, bright acousticsignal on the tunica albuginea and a central vein ( Fig 2 ). Testicular tissue identi ed in the inguinal region was considered to indicate inguinal retention; if none wasidenti ed, abdominal retention was diagnosed. Surgery The actual location of the hidden testis was con rmed at surgery. In brief, horses with inguinal retention were castrated under general anaesthesia in dorsal recumbency using a modi ed scrotal approach (Cox et al. 1975); if descended, the contralateral testis was removed using a standard closed or semi-closed technique. Abdominally retained testes were removed using a standing laparoscopic method (Hendrickson 2002) with a bipolar vessel-sealing device (Ligasure Atlas)1. The normally descended contralateral testis was then removed under standing sedation using an open technique (Turner and McIlwraith 1989), or under general anaesthesia using a closed technique. The location of retention (inguinal or abdominal) of the testis was con rmed and recorded in all cases; complete and incomplete abdominal retention was not routinely differentiated on preoperative ultrasound. Statistics Data were collated on a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel 2007)2 and statistical tests carried out using separate software(Medcalc) 3. Except where otherwise stated, descriptive statistics were calculated as median and range. Data weretested for normality using the D 'Agostino-Pearson test. Fisher 's exact test was used to compare the proportion of abdominal and inguinal testes at the 3 hospitals, and to identify any possible differences between the locations of left and right- retained cryptorchid testes. Signi cance was set at P<0.05. The results of inguinal ultrasound determination of locationwere compared with the results of surgery to calculatesensitivity, speci city, negative and positive predictive values. Results In total, 127 horses with 141 cryptorchid testes were identi ed: 113 horses were unilateral cryptorchids and the remaining 14bilateral. Seventy-one testes were retained on the left and 70 on the right. Breed distribution was 32 Warmblood, 28 Cobs, 18 Icelandic, 18 Standardbred, 13 pony, 4 Thoroughbred, 3 Irish Draught and crosses, 4 cross breeds, 3 Friesian, 2 Quarter Horse, one Appaloosa, and one Coldblood. Horse age ranged from 1 to 12 years with a mean of 3 years and median 2 years. Diagnosis Six of the 127 horses (5%) underwent endocrine blood testingprior to and one testosterone stimulation test. No horseshad a history of previous attempted surgery, even thoughsome were found to have previously undergone surgery, and8 underwent supplementary rectal examination onpresentation. Eighty- ve testes (59%) were identi ed inguinally, 46 right and 39 left; 56 (41%) were diagnosed as abdominal based onbeing absent on ultrasound scan (25 right and 31 left). Twoinguinally retained testes were not observed on ultrasound(false negatives) in one Welsh Cob and one Irish Draughtcross. Two testes were considered inguinal but subsequentlyhad to be removed from the abdomen (false positives) inone Welsh Cob and a Warmblood. These errors cancelledeach other out in the descriptive statistics, meaning that thesame numbers of inguinal and abdominal testes weresubsequently removed at surgery, 85 and 56 respectively. There was no difference in the proportion of left and right testes retained abdominally and inguinally, with 25 (45%) being abdominal, P>0.99. There wasno signi cant difference in proportion of abdominal and inguinal retained testes at the hospitals, P =0.25. Sensitivity of inguinal ultrasound to predict the location of inguinal testes was 98% (95% (95% con dence interval 88 -99%). The probability that positively identifying a testis inguinallycorrectly indicated inguinal retention (positive predictivevalue) was 98% and the chance that not seeing a testisindicated abdominal retention (negative predictive value)was 97%. The low rate of false positives and negativesprevented meaningful comparison between centres. Discussion The use of inguinal ultrasound provided a very reliable andaccurate diagnostic tool to determine the location ofcryptorchid testes before surgery, allowing cost effectivesurgical intervention with minimal morbidity. Both curvilinearand linear ultrasound probes proved ef cacious. We hypothesise that the percutaneous use of a rectal ultrasoundprobe, readily available in practice, should also be practical.Jann and Rains (1990) rst described the use of preoperative transrectal ultrasound in 11 horses to locate cryptorchidtestes, obtaining a 100% correlation with surgical ndings. Schambourg et al. (2006) described a technique of scanning 2 additional zones on the flank of the horse to visualise the abdominal testis in situ . Despite many attempts, we infrequently visualise abdominal testes using this method(Fig 4 ). This may be because horses had not been starved in many of the early cases attempted, and the authors notedthat prior starvation greatly facilitated visualisation. Ourcalculated sensitivity and speci city values of 98% and 97% respectively in 127 horses compare favourably with 93% and Fig 1: Under standing sedation, a 2 -4 MHz curvilinear ultrasound probe is used to scan the inguinal area on the missing side usingalcohol as the coupling agent. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd151 EQUINE VETERINARY / AE / MARCH 2016100% in 38 horses (Schambourg et al. 2006). Clearly, our simpli ed method of ultrasound scanning would also diagnose a normal gelding as an abdominal cryptorchid.Therefore where neither testis present, a blood test should beperformed beforehand to prove testicular tissue is present. The ratio of inguinal to abdominal testis retention was 2:1, in accordance with 2 earlier reviews of 500 and 205horses respectively (Cox et al. 1979; Coryn et al. 1981). Contrary to this nding, Stickle and Fessler (1978) found that 59.4% of retained testes were abdominal in 350 horses,despite similar ages at presentation. Hartman et al. (2015) had a similar proportion in 601 horses, namely 59% abdominal. We found an almost identical distribution of abdominal and inguinal left and right testes; whereas other studies have shown large differences, e.g .75% of left undescended testes abdominal compared to only 42% ofright testes (Stickle and Fessler 1978). Both breed and age have been shown to have a very great effect on the side and location of cryptorchid testes. Rules of thumb based on retrospective reviews are therefore a very unreliable method Fig 2: Composite of example longitudinal images obtained using a 4 MHz curvilinear ultrasound probe of the inguinal area in 6 different cryptorchid horses with no palpable evidence of a testis, cranial to the right. Inguinal testes were visible in all, large whitearrows. The size and depth was variable. Note that the abdominal wall with small intestine deep to it was often clearly visible (smallarrows). \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd152 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016to predict the location of missing left or right testes for thepurposes of surgical planning. Cryptorchids have been classi ed into 3 groups within the literature: inguinal, incomplete and complete abdominal(Cox et al. 1979). If both the testis and the epididymis are found within the abdomen, the horse is a completeabdominal cryptorchid. If the tail of the epididymis enters theinguinal canal, leaving the testis and remnants of epididymiswithin the abdomen, the horse is an incomplete abdominalcryptorchid. This made no difference to surgical approachused because the testis was inside the abdomen regardless,therefore no attempt was made to distinguish incompleteand complete abdominal retention in this series. Thesigni cance of this type of retention rests solely with inexperienced surgeons who may inadvertently remove theepididymis mistaking it for an atrophied testis. Two false positives occurred in this series, both 2-year-old horses, in which an incomplete abdominally retained testiswas retrieved. One explanation for these false positive horseswas that the epididymis was misidenti ed as a testis on ultrasound. The epididymis is clearly much smaller than atestis, but it shares many of the same characteristic featuresof structure and appearance. Routine size measurement ofthe structure may alleviate this error and improve sensitivityfurther. Another explanation could be that a testis lying veryclose or over the deep inguinal ring could be visualisedinguinally and erroneously labelled as inguinal. The only otherpossibility is that the testis retracted internally through one orboth inguinal rings during hoisting in dorsal recumbency. Tominimise time and cost, both false positive horses in this studyunderwent the transinguinal abdominal cryptorchidectomymethod described by Turner and McIlwraith (1989) ratherthan recover to undergo flank laparoscopy. Having an alternative surgical method available proved helpful in thesehorses. Other general anaesthetic techniques that havebeen described laparotomy(Cox by laparoscopy with the horse insuf flated in Trendelenburg position (Fischer and Vachon 1998; Cribb et al. 2015). Two false negatives out of 84 inguinal cases occurred; this appears to have occurred through failing to visualise theinguinal testis. Possibly the pressure of the probe temporarily displaced this testis out of view, or it was just not visualised despite being present. In one case, it was possible to retract this testis into the abdomen laparoscopically without further enlargement of the deep inguinal ring. In the other, it was not possible to retract the testis, therefore the mesorchium was transected laparoscopically and the testis subsequently removed under general anaesthesia. Besides the inguinal percutaneous ultrasound, other diagnostic examinations may help localising the missing testis. Rectal palpation has been a useful technique to determine location of abdominal testes, being utilised in 395 of 604 cases, 65% (Hartman et al. 2015). Perhaps unsurprisingly, these authors found a statistically signi cant bene cial effect of increasing operator experience, with trainee surgeons being correct in 71% of patients and faculty surgeons in 94%. Rectal palpation of the internal inguinal ring may be dangerous in some young horses and impossible in ponies, but whenever possible it can provide useful information about presence and size of theinternal inguinal ring and whether or not a ductus deferens is going into the inguinal canal. If an internal inguinal ring is not palpable at the cryptorchid side, it is highly likely that the testis is intra-abdominal.

Corresponding laparoscopic image (b) in the same horse. Visualising abdominal testes is unreliable in these authors ' experience. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd153 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016In summary, our results indicate that scanning the flank to visualise abdominally retained testes is not necessary (Schambourg et al. 2006). Ninety-eight per cent of inguinal testes were predictable by inguinal scanning and 97% of abdominal testes were correctly predicted by recording their absence inguinally. The 4 horses incorrectly diagnosed on ultrasound were relatively easily managed surgically. Hormonal evidence of active testicular tissue should be obtained in horses missing both testes before using this method of diagnosis.

Brief Summary (For Full Prescribing Information, see package insert) CAUTION: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium is (dichloromethylene) salt and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form. INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS. WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of accidental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: As a class, bisphosphonates may be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sensitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal impairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be monitored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinical signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS. Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some minerals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, immedi - ately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyper-kalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.). The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in horses less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lactating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the total dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormalities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone may be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals. Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; however, a causal relationship has not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the eld study were clinical signs of discomfort or nervousness, colic and/or pawing.

Olstad Department of Equine Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, The Netherlands; and Department of Companion Animal Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Biosciences, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Oslo, most prevalent developmentalorthopaedic disease in the horse. It is a complex disorderbecause of the interplay of factors that in fluence the formation of lesions and the ensuing natural healing process,the end result of which determines clinical outcome. Theearly pathogenetic mechanism of OC has long remainedelusive, but recent research has provided compellingevidence for vascular disturbances leading to areas ofischaemic necrosis in the subarticular growth cartilage as theprimary event. The aetiological factors that in fluence the process of the development of lesions are many and comprise both genetic and environmental factors. The genetic background of OC (dissecans) is highly complex with quantitative trait loci associated with some form of OC found on not fewer than 22 of the 33 chromosomes of the horse, and different manifestations and locations of OC having probably different genetic backgrounds. The environmentalfactors can be divided into nutritional factors and factors influencing the biomechanical loading of joints. Feeding large quantities of easily digestible carbohydrates is a clear risk factor and also the availability of suf cient copper for mares in the last part of pregnancy is important. Factors influencing the biomechanical loading of joints include the exercise regimen of foals, paddock size and roughness of terrain, and conformation. Equine OC is rarely a life- threatening disease and the prognosis of (surgical) treatment is good to very good. However, the impact on economics of the equine industry and on horse welfare is large. This impact can only be lessened by the judicious management of both horse breeding and horse husbandry. Some of the measures that would alleviate the burden of OC con flict with (commercial) pressures from the industry and a balance between human-imposed breeding and performance goals and the interest of the animal itself should be sought. Introduction The term 'osteochondritis dissecans '(inflammation of bone and cartilage with formation of loose fragments) was coinedby the German surgeon Franz K \u20aconig (1832 -1910). In his study on loose bodies in joints he discussed three possible causes.The rst two were traumatic in origin: severe trauma directly causing breaking off of fragments and lesser trauma causingnecrosis of subchondral bone, indirectly leading to fragmentformation. In the third category lesions were formed withoutany substantial trauma, but because of some (unidenti ed)underlying lesion (K \u20aconig 1887). Later, this lesion was shown to be a focal disturbance of the process of endochondral ossication (Barrie 1987). It is this last category for which the terms 'osteochondrosis '(OC) and 'OC dissecans '(OCD) are used in the veterinary literature. In the horse, the term OC was already used in the 1960s (Baker 1960), but a substantial stream of reports on the condition did not start until the early to mid-1970s. From the beginning there has been controversy about the (aetio)pathogenesis. Despite many attempts to do so, no single causative factor, environmental or genetic, could be pinpointed, and the disease is now generally acknowledged to be multifactorial. The pathogenetic mechanism was long thought to be of primary biomechanical nature, but original work in pigs and horses by Scandinavian groups has now provided convincing evidence for a predominantly vascular pathogenetic mechanism. A large problem in the research in this eld is that samples were often taken from long-existing lesions that had undergone extensive secondary processes, which had long effaced any possible traces of primary events (Pool 1993). In almost all studies using clinical material it is unfortunately not possible to say whether any abnormalities are primary or the expression of a secondary response, as it is known that the reactive repair process starts soon after initial lesion formation. The evidence for a vascular pathogenetic mechanism for OC comes from both observational and experimental studies. These studies conclude that osteochondrosis occurs as a consequence of ischaemic chondronecrosis (necrosis of cartilage that is dependent on blood supply, i.e. growth cartilage). This overview focuses on (early) pathogenesis of OC, the aetiological factors that have been identi ed and the practical implications for clinical management that follow from these. Pathogenesis of osteochondrosis Changes in vascularisation during the process of endochondral ossi cation The thick layer of epiphyseal cartilage of the growing jointthat is destined to change into bone via the process ofendochondral ossi cation is irrigated by vessels running through so-called cartilage canals (Wheeler Haines 1933)(Fig 1 ). During growth, the canals regress by a physiological process called chondri cation. The timing of this process varies between different joints, as not all joints maturesimultaneously, as also exempli ed by the large differences in closure times of physes (Butler et al. 2011). The time lag \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd155 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016between joints can be substantial. Patent cartilage canalshad disappeared in the proximal phalanx after age 3 weeks,but in the femoral condyle they were still present at 4.5months and had all regressed at age 7 months. The distaltibia was in between (Carlson et al. 1995). Vascular events in early osteochondrosis: pioneering work in the pig Much of the initial work on the early pathogeneticmechanisms of OC has been conducted in the pig, a speciesin which the disease has a high prevalence and presentsmajor economic and welfare concerns (J\u00f8rgensen andAndersen 2000). In this species it was shown that areas ofchondronecrosis related to necrotic cartilage canals could befound, which were much larger in commercial pig breeds thanin miniature pigs of wild hog ancestry (Ekman et al. 1990). Articial devascularisation led to the formation of areas of ischaemic chondronecrosis (Carlson et al. 1991; Ytrehus et al. 2004). These observations led to the hypothesis that local biomechanical damage to cartilage canals, especially to the vulnerable anastomosing branches that run through the ossication front, would be the rst step in the pathogenesis of OC (Ytrehus et al. 2007). The earliest lesion following vascular failure was an area of ischaemic chondronecrosis located at intermediate depth of the epiphyseal growth cartilage, designated as OC latens. With time, the area became surrounded by the ossi cation front and clinically apparent, at which stage it is called OC manifesta (Ytrehus et al. 2004) . Vascular events in early osteochondrosis: the situation in the horse Later work in the horse provided evidence for a similarpathogenetic mechanism in this species. Material wascollected from the distal tibia of 100 foals submitted for post mortem examination between 191 days of gestation and 153 days post partum (Olstad et al. 2007). Identical lesions to those that were previously identi ed in pigs, i.e. areas of ischaemic chondronecrosis ( Fig 2 ) were observed in the cranial intermediate ridge predilection site for osteochondrosis in nine of the 100 foals (Olstad et al. 2007).The blood supply to the distal tibia was then studied in nine Standardbred foals aged 0 -7 weeks by a technique involving arterial perfusion with barium, followed by clearing of the cartilage with methyl salicylate, which renders the perfused vessels visible to the naked eye (Olstad et al . 2008a, b). The age window for the presence of cartilage canal vessels tted with the age window for development of radiographically detectable lesions (Dik et al. 1999). During the age window when vessels were present, epiphyseal cartilage canals were initially supplied by vessels originating from the perichondrium (Olstad et al. 2008a). With time, the ossication front advanced to surround the middle portion of the cartilage canal, after which time vessels in the distal portion became reliant on an arterial source that was obliged to traverse the ossi cation front in order to enter the cartilage canal ( Fig 3 ). Lesions (n =12) were consistently located at the point where vessels should have entered cartilage canals from bone after being incorporated into it. This prompted the suggestion that vessels might be particularly vulnerable to failure at the point where they traversed the ossi cation front (Olstad et al. 2008a), i.e. where tissues of highly different plasticity meet and create a sharp stiffness gradient ( Fig 4a,b ). In the femoropatellar joint, regression of blood vessels was less advanced at this early age than in the tarsocrural joint (Olstad et al. 2008b). This agrees with the observation that the femoropatellar joint matures later with respect to most other joints (Lecocq et al. 2008) and is in line with earlier work showing that the peak of osteochondrotic lesion development is later in this joint than in most other joints (Dik et al. 1999). This means that there is no difference in pathogenetic mechanism of OC in different joints, but there may be a difference in timing. Indeed, in older foals (aged 31-336 days, mean 148 days), similar chondronecrotic areas as in the tarsal joint were found (Olstad et al. 2011). Also, in the metacarpophalangeal/metatarsophalangeal joints, a similar pattern was observed (Olstad et al. 2009). Early lesions in the tarsus were studied by micro-computed tomography (Olstad et al. 2008c) ( Supplementary Item 1 ). In still-mineralised samples, viable proliferating vessels adjacent a) b) c) Fig 1: a) Semischematic drawing of the ossi cation process of the long bones in mammals.

The tarsusmatures earlier than the sti fle and here the layer of subarticular growth cartilage has become much thinner and lost its blood supply. (Fig 1a from Van Weeren 2006.) \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd156 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016to lesions were surrounded by mineral opacity andcompatible with separate centres of endochondralossication ( Fig 5 ,Supplementary Item 2 ) that, combined with phagocytosis of necrotic cartilage and intramembranousossication of granulation tissue, could lead to lling of lesions with bone (Olstad et al. 2008a). This would explain how even major lesions can heal without leaving traces at a very earlyage (Dik et al. 1999). Finally, the hypothesis that vascular failure could lead to OC and OCD was tested experimentally by surgicaltransection of vessels supplying the epiphyseal cartilagecanals of the lateral trochlear ridge of the distal femur in 10Fjord pony foals at age 13 -15 days (Olstad et al. 2013) (Supplementary Item 3 ). Vascular transection resulted in cartilage canal and chondrocyte necrosis in all operatedfoals, and was associated with a focal delay in endochondral ossi cation, i.e. OC in three out of ve foals examined 21 days or more after transection. Pathological cartilage fracture through the area of ischaemic chondronecrosis, i.e. OCD, occurred in one foal examined 42 days after transection (Olstad et al. 2013) ( Fig 6 ). The early pathogenetic mechanism of osteochondrosis It can thus be concluded that there is at present compellingevidence for a crucial mechanistic role in the earlypathogenesis of OC in the horse of failure of vascularisationof the growth cartilage via the cartilage canals. Thismechanism can explain many features of equine OC, suchas the joint-speci c time windows (related to joint-speci c patterns in the progress of the ossi cation front and subsequent vascular rearrangements), and the frequent bilateral occurrence. However, these complex vascular rearrangements that take place during the process ofendochondral ossi cation and the related vulnerability are common to all horses and not only to those developing osteochondrotic lesions. There are, therefore, other aetiological factors that incite or predispose to lesion formation during this vulnerable period. Biomechanical loading is obviously one of them, but differences in the biochemical and/or biomechanical characteristics of key tissue components may play a role as well. These factors are partly genetically, but to a large extent environmentally determined and may hence be heavily in fluenced by the management of the young horse. Aetiological factors As pointed out, there is now convincing evidence for acommon pathogenetic mechanism for osteochondroticlesions. However, this is not equivalent to a single aetiology.There is common agreement that the background of OC is Fig 2: Microphotograph of a femur of a 114-day-old foal. A necrotic cartilage vessel, surrounded by an area of necroticmatrix can be seen (arrow). Scale bar: 1 mm.

This traversing of junctions between tissues of different plasticity (e.g. bone and cartilage) is believed to render vesselsparticularly vulnerable to failure. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd157 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH containing both genetic and environmentalelements. Heritability estimates for OC vary considerably, butare rarely higher than 0.35, which implies that most of thevariation is explained by environmental factors. There aremany environmental factors that have been shown to berelated to OC, but they can be divided into two majorcategories: those somehow in fluencing the biomechanical loading of the juvenile joints; and those related to the intake of several nutrients. Genetics There are strong indications that genetics play an importantpart in OC. Osteochondrosis does occur in feral horses, butthe prevalence is much lower (about 2.5% in the tarsocruraljoint and even 0% in the femoropatellar joint) (Valentino et al. 1999). Further, the disease is more than rare and in factvirtually absent in ponies (Bj Vo ^ute et al. 2011). Hence, either genetic factors or management factors are at the base of the high incidencein many other horse breeds; it is most probably acombination of both.Heritability Many studies have aimed at determining heritabilityestimates (h 2) for OC. However, values vary widely (for a review, Distl 2013), which is caused by the fact that this area is complicated and that there are many confounding factors. Any genetic study is heavily dependent on the de nition of the phenotype and in the case of OC the situation is severely complicated by the fact that the phenotype is not stable over time, as lesions tend to heal until a certain age. In OC, the phenotype is determined radiographically and an animal may be positive on radiography at age 6 months and free of the disease at age 12 months, thus showing either a positive or a negative phenotype depending on the moment of examination while still being genetically exactly the same animal. Further, animals presented for selection events (from which many studies have used radiographic data) are usually heavily preselected, as owners do not want to present OC- positive animals. Therefore, prevalence gures for offspring of given sires based on these studies are virtually always underestimations. Also, the number of positives may be influenced by the number of radiographic views taken, as a) b) c) Fig 5: Lesions of osteochondrosis associated with ongoing ossi cation.

Both images are perfused and cleared slabs (from a 1-week-old EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016some lesions may not be visible on standard lateromedial oranterior -posterior views. Another important confounding factor is that in some studies all osteochondral fragments arecounted as OC lesions, whereas others discriminate betweenfragments likely to be osteochondrotic in nature and thosesupposed to be of other origin, such as plantar/palmarosteochondral fragments (S\u00f8nnichsen et al. 1982; Dalin et al. 1993; Nixon and Pool 1995). Also, the outcome of genetic studies will depend on whether OC is de ned at the animal level or at the joint level. Lastly, the methodology differs between studies. Sire models only account for paternal half-sib relationships. Animal models use information on all relatives of an animal without reduction to speci c structures of relatives (Lykkjen et al. 2013, 2014). Osteochondrosis (OC) is always a categorical variable, in which case a threshold model or a transformation to the underlying distribution should be applied to avoid underestimation (J \u20aconsson et al. 2011). All these factors together make genetic studies on OC difcult to interpret and even more dif cult to compare between each other. Molecular genetics There have been great advances in molecular genetics inrecent decades. The basic genome of the horse was publishedin 2009 (Wade et al. 2009), opening the way for genome-wide association studies. Osteochondrosis was a logical candidatefor this approach and the outcome of these studies gavefurther insight in the complexity of OC. Regions associated withsome phenotypic manifestation of OC were found on no fewerthan 22 of the 33 chromosomes of the horse (Dierks et al. 2006, 2007, 2010a,b; Wittwer et al. 2007; Felicetti et al. 2009a,b; Lykkjen et al. 2010; al. 2012; Teyss /C18edre et al. 2012; Distl 2013). There appeared to be large differences with respect to these quantitative trait loci between breeds, joints and even manifestations of OC. Only two of 24 quantitative trait loci found to be associated with OC in Hanoverian Warmbloods were shown to be associated with the disease also in Thoroughbreds (Corbin et al. 2012). The phenotypic and genotypic association between OC in thetarsocrural joint and in the metacarpophalangeal/metatarsophalangeal joints turned out to be very low, if notvirtually nonexistent, in many studies (Van Grevenhof et al. 2009a,b; Lykkjen et al. 2012) and there are even indications that different manifestations of OC within the same joint(fragmentation versus flattening of the joint) may represent different traits (Van Grevenhof et al. 2009b). Hence, whilst there is uncontestably a genetic component in OC, this genetic contribution is far from straightforward.Genes involved From the molecular genetic studies, several candidate geneshave emerged as potentially implicated in OC ( Table 1 ). Many of those are not directly related to cartilage or bonemetabolism, but have more general roles. A major problemwith studies using material from horses with established OC isthat no discrimination has been made yet between primaryand secondary processes. This is very dif cult to achieve, as the healing process is known to follow soon after lesionformation. This applies also to the work comparing geneexpression pro les of leucocytes from horses affected by OC and normal controls. In that work dysregulation of a numberof pathways in OC-affected animals et al. 2010). Ihh is an interesting target, given its role together with parathyroidhormone-releasing peptide in the feedback loop involved inchondrogenesis (Semevolos et al. 2002). However, in another study no relation of genetic polymorphism of the Ihh genewith OC could be demonstrated in Polish Halfbreds (Zabeket al. 2013). In the pig the gene encoding T-box transcription factor 5 was shown to be associated with OC (Rangkaseneeet al. 2013). This is potentially interesting as this transcription factor is involved in vascularisation, but no data on the horseexist thus far. The study by Olstad et al. (2008a) on vascular changes in the growth cartilage is probably most relevant inthe quest for the genetic background of OC, as it wasperformed on very young foals. In that study the tousled-likekinase two gene and an unknown gene were upregulated infoals predisposed to OC (Austb\u00f8 et al. 2010). Genomic selection The genetic background of OC is clearly very complex andnot easy to unravel. An important limiting factor is the lack ofagreement in the de nition of the phenotype. This leads inevitably to variation in outcome. It is highly unlikely that asimple genetic test comprising only few culprit genes will everbe developed for OC. This does not exclude genomicselection. Genomic selection is a possible and likely futureavenue for the selection against OC in the horse. In genomicselection genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphismgenotype information is combined with pedigree andphenotypic data to produce genomic estimated breedingvalues. In several commercial species, such as dairy livestock,genomic selection is now reality (Stock and Reents 2013). Alimitation of genetic selection is that large referencepopulations are needed to obtain highly accurate estimatedbreeding values. This is relatively easy in cattle, but less so in a) b) Fig 6: a) and b) Pathological cartilage fracture (arrows) through the area of ischaemic chondronecrosis, i.e. osteochondrosis dissecans occurred in one foal examined 42 days after transection (Olstad et al. 2013). \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd159 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016horses. It has been shown, however, that in case of a limitednumber of phenotypic records the same individuals shouldbe phenotyped and genotyped, rather than genotypingparents and phenotyping their progeny, as is often done incommercial livestock breeding. On the condition that thegeneration interval is substantially shortened (which is possiblewhen using genomic selection), genomic selection can,under those circumstances, be more effective than classicbreeding schemes based on either own phenotypicallyrecorded performance or performance of progeny (VanGrevenhof et al. 2012). The Royal Dutch Sport Horse studbook now has changed from progeny testing to genomicselection. However, it should be realised that the geneticcomponent only accounts for a relatively small part of totalvariation, especially in certain joints such as the sti fle, and that environmental factors are more important. Environmental factors Two major groups of environmental factors play a role inequine osteochondrosis: biomechanical loading andnutritional factors. Within these main categories, there areseveral more speci c factors. Biomechanical factors Biomechanical loading of speci c sites can explain the well- known existence of consistent predilection sites within joints. It is likely that the great change in loading of the joints after birth is an important event in the pathogenesis of OC.Tiny areas of chondronecrosis have been found in all animalsin a study on 21 fetuses, but these did not feature speci c changes in the collagen matrix compatible with early OCand were seen as a feature of normal development (Lecocqet al. 2008) and no real osteochondrotic lesions have thus far been diagnosed in fetuses, which is a strong indication forthe in fluence of post natal joint loading. A triggering role for biomechanical forces acting on vessels during the timewindow of their greatest vulnerability ts very well with the vascular early pathogenetic mechanism of OC discussedearlier (Ytrehus et al. 2007; McCoy et al. 2013). Also, areas in the growth cartilage where a dramatic change in collagenbre organisation has been shown (Lecocq et al. 2008) maybe prone to biomechanically induced trauma. It is then the character of the insult (magnitude, direction of force, repetition) together with the local 'tissue quality 'that will determine whether a lesion will result or not. Biomechanical (over)loading of joints is in the horse strongly related to the exercise regimen the animal is subjected to. Physical exercise in the juvenile period is known to have a crucial role in the conditioning of the entire musculoskeletal system with consequences for injury resistance later in life (Helminen et al. 2000; Brama et al. 2002). It is exactly in this period of rapid growth and development that osteochondrotic lesions develop and OC cannot be seen separately from these developmental processes (Van Weeren and Brama 2003). Hence, exercise of foals is an important factor in the development of OC, as has been shown by several studies. In a large eld study, the so- called BOSAC (Breeding, Osteoarticular Status and Athletic Career) study (Robert et al. 2013) it was shown that there were associations of both prevalence and severity of osteochondrotic lesions with irregular access to pasture, and with keeping animals in very large plots (Lepeule et al. 2009, 2013). 'Mixed housing '(stabling overnight and pasture access during the daytime, as opposed to continuous housing at the same spot) and rough and slippery grazing grounds were also risk factors (Praud et al. 2013). Another, unrelated, study showed that that foals housed exclusively at pasture until age 1 year are signi cantly less affected by OC than foals exclusively housed in a box or 'mixed '(Vander Heyden et al. 2013). It seems therefore that lack of joint loading, or irregular joint loading in the sense of uneven joint loading over time or with respect to level and/or direction of forces that are exerted on the joints are risk factors for the development of OC. Nutritional factors Growth rate and energy intakeFrom the onset of research on OC, the impression existed thatthe disorder was principally a disorder of large-framed,rapidly growing individuals or breeds (Olsson and Reiland1978; Str \u20acomberg 1979). There appeared to be no straightforward relationship with absolute bodyweight,however; but there is now ample evidence that a highTABLE 1: Candidate genes potentially involved in equine osteochondrosis as identi ed by quantitative molecular genetic investigations Abbreviation Gene name n Phenotypic trait Breed References NCDN family member 45 OC(D) TC; MCP/MTP NT Lykkjen et al. AE / MARCH 2016growth rate, at least a high growth rate during certainperiods of time, most probably those coinciding with thevarious windows of vulnerability of speci c joints, is a factor associated with more, or more severe, OC lesions (Lepeuleet al. 2013). Mechanistically, a high growth rate may just put the physiological process of endochondral ossi cation under excessive pressure and thereby increase the risk of lesiondevelopment. However, when the high growth rate is causedby the use of high-energy diets, especially when fed in theform of easily digestible carbohydrates, also anothermechanism comes into action, as these diets result in astrong post prandial hyperinsulinaemia (Glade 1986, 1987).Horses with OC have been shown to have higher postprandial glucose and insulin responses to feeding with high-grain ratios than normal horses (Ralston 1996). Imbalances ofinsulin and its derivatives insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I andIGF-II have a direct effect on the process of endochondralossication and OC-positive foals have been shown to activity than OC-negative foals (Sloet van Oldruitenborgh-Oosterbaan et al. 1999). Insulin also stimulates the rapid removal of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 from the circulation (Glade et al. 1984), which are involved in chondrocyte differentiation and in the invasion of growth cartilage by blood vessels before its conversion to bone. The effect of carbohydrates on thyroid hormone levels is present in weanlings, but not in yearlings (Glade and Reimers 1985), which may be a factor in the determination of the speci c time windows for OC. It is clear that nutrition-relatedhormonal imbalances may play a role in the development of equine OC, but they are, like unfavourable exercise conditions, a risk factor and not a sole aetiological factor. Imbalances in trace elements and minerals There has been a strong interest in nutritional copper since a relationship was reported between low serum copper, ceruloplasmin level and OC in the early 1980s (Bridges et al. 1984). Incriminating low copper levels as the main cause of OC seemed very attractive, as there was a very plausible mechanism (decreased levels of lysyl-oxidase, a copper- dependent enzyme involved in collagen cross-linking), and because there was epidemiological evidence emerging that low nutritional copper was linked to higher levels of developmental orthopaedic diseases on stud farms in Kentucky and Ohio (Knight et al. 1985). Further, excessive intake of cadmium or zinc, both copper antagonists by displacing it from the sulfhydryl binding sites on metallothionein, was shown to result in OC-like lesions (Gunson et al. 1982). However, the reality was more complicated than that. In experimental studies it was shown that copper or zinc imbalances had to be huge to exert any effect and the resulting lesions were often much more severe than seen clinically (Bridges and Harris 1988; Bridges and Mof tt 1990). Copper intake recommendations were raised from the original National Research Council (NRC) recommendation of 10 ppm (NRC 1989) to 20 -25 ppm (Hurtig et al. 1993) or even 50 ppm (Lewis 1995), but the rationale of these measures became questionable when it was shown that in New Zealand, a country where horses tend to stay out on grass all year round and the OC prevalence is traditionally low, the natural copper level in grass was 4.3 -8.6 ppm (Pearce et al. 1998). Foals are, as many mammalian species, born with a large stock of copper in the liver that they need during the rstmonths of life, as milk contains hardly any copper. The copper level in the liver declines gradually to normal levels at the moment they eat enough grass to ensure suf cient daily intake (Egan and Murrin 1973). In a study in Thoroughbreds mean liver copper concentrations were shown to decline from 374 mg/kg dry matter at birth to 21 mg/kg dry matter at 160 days (Gee et al. 2000). Liver copper concentrations in foals appeared not to be related to the formation of osteochondrotic lesions, but foals with higher liver copper concentrations showed better lesion resolution, and thus may result in better nal clinical outcome (Van Weeren et al. 2003). Mechanistically, copper may have a chondroprotective effect through reduction of the activity of the proteinases cathepsin B and cathepsin D (Davies et al. 1996), rather than act via lysyl oxidase (Jeffcott and Davies 1998). The calcium/phosphorus balance is of importance too. High calcium levels were found to have no in fluence on the incidence of OC in foals, but four times the NRC recommendation of phosphorus resulted in a signi cantly increased number of lesions (Savage et al. 1993). The supposed mechanism was via the induction of secondary hyperparathyroidism, which would cause increased osteoporosis and hence weakening of the subchondral bone. This is an interesting study, as 2.5 -6.5 month-old-foals were studied, which is an age that much later was identi ed as an age interval when the dynamic process of OC is very active and animals are very susceptible to the disorder. Osteochondrosis in the equine industry Equine OC is a complex and multifactorial disorder that isintricately linked to the physiological processes that are goingon in the young, growing horse. The disorder is of greatrelevance to the equine industry. It has been estimated thatin North-Western Europe alone, each year 20,000 -25,000 foals are born that will manifest some form of OC during their life(Van Weeren and Barneveld 1999). The direct loss of animalsmay be limited, as only few foals are so heavily affected thatthey need to be subjected to euthanasia ( Fig 7 ), but many of the other animals will require surgery at some stage. Thismeans substantial economic loss to the equine industry and isalso a serious welfare issue. A more indirect effect is theelimination from the population of many otherwise veryattractive potential sires because of OC. This loss may easilybe up to 30% of potential breeding stock. Both genetics and a multitude of environmental factors play a role. It lies at hand, therefore, that no simple 'one size ts all 'management strategies exist that can remediate, let alone eradicate, the disorder. For a better appreciation of OC in the larger picture of the equine industry and to understand the implications of modern horse management for OC, it may be good to place equine osteochondrosis in its historical perspective. Osteochondrosis -a'modern 'disease Unlike many other equine diseases of which written reports goback hundreds or even thousands of years, OC in the horse isa relatively new phenomenon. Nilsson 's report from 1947 is generally seen as the rst publication on equine OC (Nilsson 1947), but it is not until the early 1970s that the disease is mentioned more frequently (Birkeland 1972; De Moor et al. 1972) and only from the 1980s onwards the disorder is \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd161 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE an important developmentalorthopaedic disorder (McIlwraith 1986). nonpreselected populations is than (Wittwer et al. 2006; Van Grevenhof et al. 2009a). This huge increase in importance of OC over recent decades is concomitant with profound changes of the management of horses, especially sport horses. Recent changes in the equine industry and horse husbandry Horses have grown considerably taller within a relatively shortperiod. In the wild, there is no equid, from onager to zebra,which has an average height at the withers of over 16 hands(~1.6 m). The Dutch Warmblood horse has increased in average withers height with 1 mm/year over the past25 years. In other breeds, such as the Andalusian (or PuraRaza Epa ~nola) this increase is even more. An increase of 1 mm may seem minimal, but it should be realised that thedevelopment from two-hands-tall ( ~20 cm) Hyracotherium or to Prezewalski horse that has an average heightat the withers of 12 -14 hands ( ~1.2-1.4 m) took 65 million years. If Eohippus had increased in height at the same rate as the Dutch Warmblood, the present-day horse would stand 634,600 hands (or slightly over 40 miles, 63 km) tall ! Horses are seasonal breeders with foals typically being born in spring, which in nature gives them the best chance to survive the critical early juvenile phase of life. By setting the ofcial 'birthday 'of horses at 1st January (1st August for the southern hemisphere), we have prompted a demand for early foals, as these will be older and thus on average stronger in their age class, which is an advantage during the rst years of competition. Such a policy has, however, consequences for the management of these foals. In many parts of the world, weather conditions in mid-winter do not permit keeping mares and foals outside for long periods of time. Forcibly, the animals will be con ned to stables for most of the time, which severely hampers their possibility to exercise. Many studies have been conducted on the effect of exercise on the development of the equine musculoskeletal system (for a review see Birch et al. 2013) and as yet free pasture exercise for 24 h a day in moderately sized plots comes out as the optimal exercise condition for raising foals (Van Weeren and Denoix 2013).Obesity and related hormonal imbalances and metabolic disorders such as diabetes are currently rampant and a serious human health concern in many parts of the world. The phenomenon is, however, on the increase in horses too. In a recent study a prevalence as high as 31% was reported (Robin et al. 2015). The causes are similar: excessive high- energy nutritional intake and insuf cient exercise. Insulin resistance has been reported as a consequence (Carter et al. 2009), although the relationship with obesity does not seem to be straightforward in the horse (Bamford et al. 2015). Alterations in insulin metabolism may affect the process of endochondral ossi cation directly along the pathways discussed earlier. In some horse breeds selection pressure is high, as is the case in the racing breeds and in Warmbloods; in other breeds, such as in most pony breeds and Coldbloods, selection pressure is much less. It may not be coincidental that the prevalence of OC is generally much higher in the breeds subjected to a high selection pressure, and those having a very narrow genetic base such as the Friesian horses, than in the breeds that are subject to much less intense, if any, selection pressure. Some of the traits we tend to select for, such as early maturity in the racing breeds andever-taller horses in many Warmblood breeds, may well be related to the vulnerability for the development of certain manifestations of OC. How to manage equine osteochondrosis in a practical sense? In practice, OC is commonly dealt with surgically through thearthroscopic removal of loose fragments and/or debridementof affected areas. The prognosis of these interventions isgood to excellent for most affected joints (for a review,McIlwraith 2013). Further, the effect of minor lesions onultimate performance has been shown to be minimal, if any(Robert et al. 2006; Verwilghen et al. 2013), which means that in some cases no intervention may carry a good prognosis aswell. Overall, the disorder is manageable and direct clinicalimpact is limited. Nevertheless, often horses are operated forcosmetic and/or commercial reasons and the indirecteconomic and welfare impact remains, as well as thesubstantial loss of potential breeding stock. a) b) Fig 7: a) Post mortem specimen of a 7.5 month-old-foal with a very severe OC lesion of the lateral trochlear ridge of the femur. The foals were known to have accidentally slipped at age 1 week. Upon radiographic examination at that age, only distension of thefemoropatellar joint was visible. b) Radiographic re-examination at age 4.5 months showed a large radiolucent area with surroundingbone sclerosis (arrowheads) in the lateral femoral (From Denoix et al. 2013.) \u00a92015 VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016To mitigate the effect of OC on the equine industry, several measures can be taken. Nutritionally, young horses should not be fed excessively and especially easily digestible carbohydrates should be avoided. This will reduce the chance of hormonal imbalances and may also reduce growth rate. It may be advisable to give supplemental copper (e.g. oral supplementation with copper sulfate equivalent to 0.5 mg Cu/kg live weight/day; Pearce et al. 1998) in late pregnancy in areas where the natural availability of copper is marginal to ensure high liver copper levels in the newborn foals. Foals should further be given sufcient pasture access, ideally all day long. Care should be taken that any changes in biomechanical loading of the vulnerable juvenile joints should be gradual and that high peak-loading (e.g. through inconsistent exercise opportunity or very rough terrain) should be avoided. As current management and breeding practices are strongly implicated in the high incidence of OC in many breeds, some of them should be questioned. Do we really need to grow ever-taller horses where for millennia we were happy with much smaller ones? It is known, with the dog presumably as best example, that breeding to extremes will lead to severe health problems and thus generate serious welfare issues. In a performance animal such as the horse there is a kind of natural limitation to these excesses, but it is a moral obligation of the equine community not to go down that road and to balance the ambitions set by man with the health and well-being of the horse. Equine OC is to a certain extent inherent to the species, as illustrated by the presence of the disorder in feral horses (Valentino et al. 1999), and will probably never be totally eliminated. The impact on economics of the equine industry and on the welfare of the horse can be considerably lessened by the judicious management of both breeding and a large number of environmental factors. There is a task for the equine veterinarian to increase public awareness of the many relevant factors that have been reviewed in this article and to in fluence decision-taking in the equine industry.

M. House*and L. K. Warren Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine, Gainesville, USA; andDepartment of Animal Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, Although diagnosis and treatment of horses with colic haveimproved in the last 30 years, horses with recurrent colic canbe a diagnostic and management challenge for both ownersand veterinarians, and colic remains a high priority healthconcern of owners (Mellor et al . 2001). Nutritional management of these cases is often based on previous experience combined with recommendations from the evidence-based literature. This review will brie fly summarise the aetiologies of recurrent colic and primarily focus on evidence-based nutritional management of colonic impactions, sand enteropathy, in flammatory bowel disease, and idiopathic recurrent colic, which is limited. Additional topics to be covered elsewhere in this series that are relevant to this topic include nutritional management of gastric ulceration, liver disease, colitis, geriatric horses, and feeding the horse pre- and post surgery. Introduction Recurrent colic can be de ned as repeated episodes of abdominal discomfort over weeks to years with normalperiods in between; while chronic colic refers to evidence ofcolic signs being observed daily for 3 or more days(Schramme 1995; Mair and Hillyer 1997). The causes ofrecurrent colic are varied and reported aetiologies includeparasitism, ulcers, large intestinal obstructions, intestinalneoplasia, small intestinal stenosis, obstruction or muscularhypertrophy, abdominal abscess, abdominal adhesions,chronic grass sickness, enteroliths, intra- or extra-luminalmasses resulting in partial obstructions, in flammatory disease (such eosinophilic or 1997).Although a de nitive aetiology cannot always be determined, many diagnostics are currently available toassist in determining the most likely cause. Nutritionalmanagement of these cases can be challenging to directwithout the establishment of a de nitive aetiology. In one study (Mair and Hillyer 1997), causes caecalimpactions, thromboembolic disease and intussusceptions.Exploratory celiotomy may be recommended to attempt tomake a de nitive diagnosis, but owners should be aware that some cases are not amenable to treatment. The prognosis forsuccessful surgical resolution is determined by the lesion, asfor any type of colic, but is probably comparable to theprognosis for acute surgical forms of colic. In some horses in which a speci c cause is not found at surgery, clinical signs can persist after surgery, and usually dietary and management changes are recommended for these horses. Treatment and management of affected horses are most effective when they can be targeted at a speci c established diagnosis. Nutritional management of colonic impactions The most frequent type of simple obstruction resulting in colicis impaction (Tinker et al. 1997a; White and Dabareiner 1997). An association between feeding practices and disturbancesin gastrointestinal function has long been hypothesised, butthe mechanisms linking diet with the development ofintestinal dysfunction are poorly understood (Clarke et al. 1990; Geor and Harris 2007). Recent changes in type of feedor amount of concentrate fed have been associated withincreased risk of colic in general (Cohen et al. 1995, 1999; Tinker et al. 1997b; Hudson et al. 2001), as well as increased impaction and distension colic (Clarke et al. 1990; Hillyer et al. 2002). A 2007 study of impaction colic in donkeys indicated that the risk of colic was more than doubled in those fed extra concentrate rations (Cox et al. 2007). Changing to a poorer-quality, less digestible hay may also predispose horses to large colon impaction (Cohen et al. 1999). Many prospective studies have identi ed speci c feedstuffs that may present greater colic risk. Although it has not been a consistent nding, pelleted feeds have been proposed to represent a colic risk in some studies (Tinker et al. 1997b). A study in the UK reported increased risk of large colon volvulus in horses fed sugar beet pulp and those fed hay rather than haylage or grass in the month preceeding veterinary treatment (Suthers et al. 2013). In a subpopulation of crib-biting/wind-sucking horses, colic risk was found to be higher in horses fed either hay or haylage compared to grass (Escalona et al. 2014). It is important to note that the composition of feedstuffs can vary greatly, and prospective studies are limited in their de nitive evaluation of feeding management and other associative effects that may also influence colic risk (e.g. feed/forage quality, amount fed, number of feedings, group competition at feeding time, how quickly new feed sources are introduced); thus, the association of colic events with speci c feedstuffs are not universal to all horses or feeding programmes. Understanding some of the aetiologies and predisposing factors of colonic impactions, we can focus the discussion on nutritional management of these cases. Horses suffering from simple colic rarely need signi cant alterations in their diet. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd167 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016Feeding horses following impaction is best initiated withoutgrain or pasture until normal intestinal transit is established(White and Dabareiner 1997). When a colonic impaction isidenti ed, initial therapy typically consists of a combination of analgesics, sedative analgesics, oral and/or intravenous fluids, and laxatives. Decreased faecal output and appetite arecommonly reported (Hallowell 2008). As such, nutritionalmanagement involves feed restriction until repeatexamination per rectum or manure output suggests that refeeding will not add to the impaction (White andDabareiner 1997). As resolution of the impaction becomesevident, forage meals are slowly reintroduced. The authorstypically reintroduce hay in small feedings 4 -6 times per day, beginning with several handfuls to one-quarter flake, and increasing over 2 -4 days until returned to maintenance feeding levels. Weighing hay is recommend to determine the ideal maintenance rate, as a single flake may weigh 1-2 kg depending on forage type. In the immediate post colic period, the authors advocate eliminating concentrates for a short period of 3 -7 days, depending on colic severity, following gradual reintroduction. For routine feeding of concentrate, provision of more frequent (3 times/day), smaller meals (each <0.4% of bodyweight) throughout the day is recommended to minimise delivery of undigested hydrolysable carbohydrate to the hindgut (Geor and Harris 2007). Ultimately, a well established target for healthy adult horses is consumption of approximately 2 - 2.5% of their body weight daily, with at least 1.5% of bodyweight as good quality hay or pasture (Geor and Harris 2007; NRC 2007). Nutritional management of sand enteropathy Sand colic can often be resolved with medical treatment,but nutritional management for cases that require surgeryshould follow post operative colic recommendations (Geor2008). Acute medical management of sand enteropathytypically involves a combination of mineral oil and psylliumsupplementation, occasionally with the addition ofmagnesium sulfate. In one retrospective study evaluatingmedical management of sand enteropathy, 90% of horsessurvived to discharge and 50% of horses that had repeatabdominal radiographs demonstrated an improvement indegree of sand accumulation (Hart et al. 2013). The most common laxative protocol in the study by Hart et al. (2013) was a combination of psyllium and mineral oil administeredvia nasogastric tube. Recommendations for nutritionalmanagement of sand colic have varied from highlydigestible forage or pelleted feed for 2 -3 weeks after sand has cleared, to provision of free choice hay, to no dietary change at all (Stratton-Phelps and Fascetti 2003). The most important treatment for horses with sand colic is to change their feeding management to prevent further ingestion of sand (Stratton-Phelps and Fascetti 2003). Routine recommendations for horses on pasture include feeding horses in bins, racks or structures elevated above the ground to reduce inadvertent consumption of sand. If horses are fed on the ground, provision of ground covering such as rubber mats or a concrete slab, should be provided to minimise exposure to sand. Feeding directly on the ground in paddocks where there is short or no grass is a published risk factor for sand-related gastrointestinal disease (Husted et al.2005). Published studies regarding the ef cacy of various supplements for prevention and removal of sand are limited. A study conducted at the University of Illinois found that psyllium treatment (1 g/kg bwt for 11 days) was no more effective than nonsupplementation for removing sand (10 g/ kg bwt) placed surgically into the caecum of ponies (Hammock et al. 1998). Further, the researchers reported that simply housing ponies away from sand resulted in clearance of 70% of the sand load over 11 days. The University of Florida administered a small amount of sand (300 g) via nasogastric tube and tested 4 means of sand removal: 1) hay fed at 1.5% of bodyweight; 2) hay fed at 2.5% of bodyweight; 3) hay fed at 1.5% of bodyweight plus psyllium (0.5 g/kg bwt) fed in a single dose; and 4) hay fed at 1.5% of bodyweight with psyllium (0.25 g/kg bwt) fed twice daily for 6 days. The results indicated that feeding large amounts of hay (2.5% of bodyweight, 11 kg for a 450 kg horse) uniformly produced the largest sand output (Lieb and Weise 1999). A study in Austria fed horses 1 kg sand mixed with the daily ration of grain for 5 days, followed by treatment with mineral oil (2 l q.i.d.) or mineral oil plus psyllium (1 g/kg bwt) and found greater excretion of faecal ash (as a measure of sand clearance) with the combination compared to mineral oil alone (Hotwagner and Iben 2008). A study in Colorado reported that a supplement containing psyllium, probiotics and prebiotics resulted in an increase in faecal sand output in horses with naturally occurring sand load (Landes et al. 2008). However, both the Austrian and Colorado studiesfailed to include an untreated control, making it dif cult to discern whether psyllium, or simply a change of management (and possible sand exposure) was more effective. Nutritional management of recurrent colic from inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are characterised by inltration of the intestinal mucosa and submucosa with cells, eosinophils, 2000; al. 2000; Archer et al. 2006; Perez Olmos et al. 2006). Clinical signs of IBD in the horse include weight loss, colic, lethargy and dependent oedema, often associated with enteric protein loss and malabsorption of nutrients, including glucose. Medical management of these cases routinely involves corticosteroid treatment and some dietary management. Historically, prognosis for equine IBD has been considered to be guarded to poor (Kemper et al. 2000; Schumacher et al. 2000; McCue et al. 2003). However, a more recent study looked at response to treatment of presumptive IBD with corticosteroids and anthelmintics and reported an overall prognosis for long-term survival to be fair to moderate, with a 3-year survival rate of 65% (Kaikkonen et al. 2014). That same study identi ed a low peak xylose concentration in absorption testing to be associated with a less favourable prognosis (Kaikkonen et al. 2014). Discussion of dietary management in published IBD studies is limited, probably because nutritional management of these cases \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd168 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016may vary based on the feed tolerance of individual horses.Cases requiring intestinal resection should be fed accordingto post operative colic guidelines (Geor 2008). Those notrequiring resection may need to be fed a complete pelleteddiet if hay results in signs of obstruction through thickenedportions of intestine. In general, protein requirements in thesecases are increased, and a highly digestible feed with 14%crude protein or higher is recommended (Stratton-Phelps andFascetti 2003). Beet pulp and other feeds high in digestiblebre will serve as an additional source of nutrients in IBD patients through increased production of volatile fatty acidsby bacteria in the large intestine. Stabilised rice bran (250 - 500 ml, twice daily) may be bene cial because it is a source of moderately soluble bre and fat and provides an additional source of calories (Stratton-Phelps and Fascetti 2003). Supplemental fat can be gradually added to the ration to increase the energy density of the diet (vegetable oil at 125 -250 ml, once or twice daily). Nutritional management of idiopathic recurrentcolic Unfortunately, there are occasions when all of our diagnostictests do not provide a de nitive aetiology for what is causing recurrent colic in our cases. These cases are the mostchallenging to make recommendations for as the evidence-based literature is limited on what ideal nutritionalmanagement should be. In the authors 'opinion, nutritional management is often led by trial and error, and whatultimately is best tolerated by the patient. In these cases,initial recommendations often include removal of hay, andswitching to pasture and/or a complete pelleted feed,spread over multiple (3 -4) feedings per day. In the authors ' experience, these horses often bene t from 24 h turn out in conjunction with dietary modi cations. It is critical to ensure the horse remains on a calorically appropriate diet withadequate bre for the large intestine. Although an absolute bre requirement has not been established for the horse, in the authors 'experience the diet should contain, at a minimum 1%, of bodyweight as forage or other high bre roughage ( >50% neutral detergent bre, or >18% crude bre). More ideally, roughage intake would be at least 1.5% ofbodyweight. Any changes to the diet must be madegradually, including switching from pasture to hay, orchanging the formula or physical form (textured vs. pellets)of concentrates. Many horse owners recognise the need forthis transition when adding or changing concentrates, butthey may not apply similar management when changingforage options. For example, horse owners who lack storagespace for buying hay or other conserved forage in largequantities should be encouraged to gradually introduceeach new batch they purchase, even if it is the same typeor variety of forage, unless a similar origin of the new foragecan be con rmed (e.g. same harvest date on the same eld, but purchased on separate occasions). Progressively blending larger amounts of the new feedstuff withsimultaneous reductions of the old feedstuff over a minimumof 7 -10 days is recommended by the authors. Available research suggests this timeframe is suitable to permitadaptation within the major microbial communities of thehindgut (Van den Berg et al. 2013; Fernandes et al. 2014), but a longer transition period may be needed for moredrastic dietary changes.Nutritional management of enteroliths Enteroliths are intestinal calculi composed predominantly ofstruvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate).These stones typically form in the right dorsal colon, and cansubsequently be responsible for complete or partial obstructionof the right dorsal, transverse, or descending colon (Hassel et al. 2008). Enterolithiasis has a worldwide distribution; however, a) b) Fig 1: a) Small stones passed in manure from draught horse. b) Radiographs of stones with mineral courtesy ofDr Woelfel. \u00a92016 VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016certain geographic regions such as California have a higherprevalence (Lloyd et al. 1987; Hassel et al. 1999). Many causes for the pathophysiology of enterolith formation have been hypothesised, but a de nitive pathogenesis remains uncertain. Previous studies evaluating dietary and environmentalmanagement practices in horses with enteroliths haveidenti ed associations with feeding of alfalfa hay, breed predispositions (Arabian descent), spending 50% of time outdoors and lack of daily access to pasture grazing (Hasselet al. 1999, 2004, 2008; Cohen et al. 2000). Additionally, excessive dietary levels of magnesium, nitrogen and phosphorous, combined with an alkaline colonic pH, are thought to contribute to enterolith formation (Hassel et al. 2004). Foreign objects, collectively referred to as nidi, are typically required for their development. Small stones, nails, pins, needles, coins, metal fragments, horse hair, cloth and rubber may act as nidi within the equine intestinal tract (Bray 1995).Alfalfa hay contributes to alkalinisation of the colon and provides an abundant source of magnesium, nitrogen and calcium to the diet (Bray 1995; Hassel et al. 2008). Alkaline conditions within the colon enable magnesium, ammonia and phosphorous to crystallise on a nidus, gradually allowing an intestinal stone to form rings, layer by layer (Lloyd et al. 1987; Bray 1995). A small stone(s) may be eliminated with normal passage of manure ( Figs 1 and 2). Large enteroliths are typically discovered when they cause complete or partial obstruction, and subsequent signs of colic; these cases will require exploratory celiotomy for removal of the stone. Dietary considerations relative to enterolith formation should include: eliminate excess magnesium; eliminate excess nitrogen by not feeding excessive protein; balancing the calcium and phosphorus ratio; and potentially reducing the pH in the gastrointestinal tract (Bray 1995). A more recent study by Hassel et al. (2008), found that feeding >50% 59.6 mm det. 48.7 mm det. RIMG_T:2:12 58.6 det.16.8 mm det.8.9 mm det. Fig 2: Abdominal radiographs of draught horse with the stones shown in Fig 1 . \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd170 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / MARCH 2016of the diet as alfalfa hay increased the risk of enterolithiasis.Statistical analysis of that study revealed that feeding grassand oat hay had a protective effect above and beyondthat of the reduction in alfalfa feeding. The authorshypothesised that the combination of lower protein andmagnesium content and higher bre content, resulted in liberation of short chain fatty acids, the primary end productof bre fermentation, helping to create a colonic environment less conducive to enterolith formation. Ingestionof lower quantities of protein and magnesium may also resultin less ammonium and magnesium availability for theprecipitation of struvite (Hassel et al. 2008). Additionally, the study found the odds of enterolithiasis 2.8 times higher inhorses that did not have access to daily pasture grazing. Ifdaily pasture access is associated with an increase inactivity level, this may play a role in reducing the risk of thedisease (Hassel et al. 2008). Although feeding wheat bran, rice bran, and oat bran have been implicated as risk factorsfor stone formation, multiple studies have found noassociation with feeding bran products (Cohen et al. 2000; Hassel et al. 2004, 2008). Based on the 2008 study by Hassel et al. and others, recommended preventative measures for high risk horses or those with a known history of enterolithsinclude elimination of alfalfa products, feeding an oat orgrass hay, daily access to pasture grazing, and potentiallythe addition of a daily grain feeding. The addition of applecider vinegar (112 -205 ml q.i.d.) was shown to be effective at reducing the pH of the colon in ponies fed a grass hayand grain diet (Hintz et al. 1989); however, the use of vinegar has not been evaluated with regard to enterolith prevention. In summary Nutritional management of recurrent colic can be challengingand may lack evidence-based recommendations in caseswhere a de nitive aetiology has not been established. A complete diagnostic evaluation to elucidate the cause ofrecurrent colic is ideal whenever possible. As mentionedabove, all changes to the diet should be made gradually,especially in circumstances when a feed trial is instituted and adenitive diagnosis has not been established.

Quality of the evidence An absence of systemic reviews, controlled clinical trials,case-control studies or large case series means that definitiveevidence of TMJ disorder in horses is limited. This search usedbroad search terms, and only found mention of TMJ disorderamongst editorials and review articles. The experimentalstudies of diagnostic approaches are robust and providegood evidence for the benefits of advanced imagingmodalities for this complex structure. Can this evidence be applied in my case population/clinical scenario? Anatomical studies have provided robust data for the application of a variety of diagnostic and surgical techniques,including radiography (Townsend et al . 2009), . 1999b; Rodr\u00edguez et al . 2007), but these have primarily been applied to the management of fractures (Devine et al . 2005), luxations (Hurtig et al . 1984; Hardy and Shiroma 1991), and nonseptic arthritis (Carmalt and Wilson 2005; Nagyand Simhofer 2006), rather than the more vague TMJ disorder. Experimental evidence regarding the cytokine response in the TMJ indicates that this joint may show different cytokinedynamics to other diarthrodial joints (Carmalt et al . 2011), and does not definitively support the possibility of putative TMJdisorder contributing to the cluster of vague clinical signs listed.Dental pathology has been postulated as one cause of , TMJ cytokineconcentrations did not age dentalpathology score in one study (Carmalt et al . 2006). Clinical message Confirmed reports of TMJ disorder in horses are absent, but this may be due to the diagnostic challenge that results fromnonspecific signs. It is clear from this search that diagnostictechniques have progressed and should allow more specificdiagnoses to be made. It is hoped that robust (multi-centre)case series will follow.

L. pomona can colonize in the kidneys, be shed in the urine and the horse can become septicemic, which can potentially lead to abortion, uveitis and acute renal failure. LEPTO EQ INNOVATOR\u00ae is the rst Leptospira vaccine developed speci cally for horses to help prevent leptospirosis caused by L. pomona . It also helps prevent infections of the blood, which could, but has not been demonstrated to, help reduce the potential risk of equine recurrent uveitis, abortion or acute renal failure caused by L. pomona .* An effi cacy trial demonstrated LEPTO EQ INNOVATOR safely helps prevent L. pomona infections and urinary shedding. 1 A safety trial showed it was 99.8% reaction-free.2,3 To learn more, visit LEPTOEQINNOVATOR.com. *Currently, there are no vaccines available with USDA-licensed label claims against equine abortions, uveitis or acute renal failure due to L. pomona .KEEP YOUR HORSE IN THE PICTURE.
