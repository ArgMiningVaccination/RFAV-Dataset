The Path to Defeating COVID19 As the trusted champion for lung health, the American Lung Association is focused on slowing the spread and defeating COVID-19. To protect the overall population and those most vulnerable, COVID-19 vaccines are recommended, readily available and effective at protecting people from getting severe COVID-19 illness. People who are up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines have the best available protection against COVID-19. We encourage everyone to be up to date on their COVID-19 vaccines. COVID-19 vaccines are recommended and available for everyone 6 months and older. We know the vaccines are effective in preventing severe COVID illness and those who are vaccinated and boosted are much less likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19. For this reason, the American Lung Association urges you to be up to date with your vaccinations, which means you have received all vaccines you are eligible for including all primary series doses and recommended boosters. Everyone 6 months and older are recommended to be up to date on their COVID-19 vaccination. - All recommended COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective and reduce your risk of severe illness. - You are considered up to date on your COVID-19 vaccines when you have received all COVID-19 vaccines recommended for you. - Updated guidance for COVID-19 vaccination, includes the following revisions of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccination schedule: - Monovalent or original mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for use in the United States as part of the simplified recommendations. - People ages 6 years and older who are unvaccinated or previously received only monovalent vaccine doses are recommended to receive 1 bivalent mRNA vaccine dose. - People ages 65 years and older may receive an additional bivalent vaccine and individuals who are immunocompromised may receive additional bivalent mRNA vaccine doses. COVID-19 Vaccine Recommendations One bivalent mRNA dose. Vaccination is complete. One bivalent mRNA dose with an opportunity for an optional additional bivalent mRNA dose at least 4 months later. One bivalent mRNA dose followed by an optional bivalent mRNA dose at least 2 months later.

On April 19, 2023, the CDC updated the COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to simplify vaccination guidance. - If you are six years of age or older and have already received one bivalent vaccine you are all set for the time being unless you are 65+ or immunocompromised. - If you are 65+ or immunocompromised, you may receive additional bivalent vaccinations. Everyone 6 years of age or older should receive a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine if you have not received one yet. For children 6 months through 5 years of age, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended and varies by age, vaccine and previous vaccination. The updated COVID-19 boosters are bivalent. This means that they: - Boost immunity against the original coronavirus strain and - Provide protection against the newer Omicron variants that have been circulating and account for most COVID-19 cases. They are intended to provide better protection against COVID-19. This new updated booster replaces the existing monovalent vaccine booster for individuals 5+. Vaccine Safety The U.S. has an established vaccine safety system that ensures all vaccines are as safe as possible. The safety of a COVID-19 vaccine is a top priority.
