Very significant studies in children and adults recently showed its preventive effect if used twice a day all winter or during allergy season. NasaMist is sterile and buffered with bicarbonate/baking soda, to reduce painful irritation. Hypertonic formulations help to shrink swollen, in- flamed tissues, and help drain mucous to reduce Eusta- chian tube congestion and post -nasal drip, both main factors of cough and ear infection in children. VITAMIN D = needs to be given all year, since suntan or sunburn prevent its natural skin production from the sun. Besides boosting the immunity against winter germs, it also helps prevent seasonal depression. Daily doses start at 400 IU for infants, up to 600 IU at 4 years and up, and 800 -1,000 IU for adolescents and adults. Doses can be given weekly (respectively 3,000, 4,000 and 5 -6,000/week) * * * Humidifers do not prevent illness but facilitate breathing and expectoration in cold, dry weather con- ditions, and should be set in the comfort zone of about 30 -35% humidity .

Covid vaccine is the only proven defense and is recommended for all eligible patients. The Flu vaccine has now been shown to reduce severity of Covid -19. Seasonal epidemic flu in Westchester usually appears from mid -December until March. Local weekly information on the flu is available here: http://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/ communicable/influenza/surveillance/ Tamiflu is rarely useful in healthy children, and should be reserved for the fragile and unvaccinated patients at risk for severe complications and hospitalized. Beyond washing hands with soap and water, and basic hygiene, recent clinical studies showed very clearly that 5 major preventive factors each help reduce the fre- quency, duration and complications of Upper Respira- tory Infections, cold or flu -like infections. * * * Sleep = lack of sleep is a major risk factor, and has be- come very prevalent in today 's children! Zinc = 10 -15 mg/day found in Flintstone Complete or Centrum Kids (NOT the Gummy type) or equivalent type of multivitamin; can also be taken by itself too (that 's still more than lots of meat or lentils daily ...) Nasal Saline Spray = Isotonic twice a day all winter ; use the Hypertonic Saline to treat congestion or runny nose. The NasaMist brand contains bicarbonate and reduces irritation and stinging = much more comforta- ble! Probiotic a day all winter , mixed with apple sauce, yogurt or milk (or 1 Chewable or capsule twice a day) Vitamin D: Grand -ma's Cod Liver Oil has regained its immune boosting effects through daily or weekly intake of Vitamin D3. Cough in children is almost always due to post -nasal drip, except in bronchiolitis and asthma (small bronchi in lungs), or croup and of course Strep (throat, trachea and possible pneumonia). Bacterial pneumonia and bronchitis have become ex- tremely rare since vaccination with Hib and Prevnar. Pertussis is once again on the rise: vaccination is essential for children and their parents and care -givers. Treatment is purely supportive, death common in infants. If mucous gets trapped in the Eustachian tube then in the middle ear, it can lead to pain from barometric pressure changes, or infection when germs are trapped and grow in the middle ear. In children, the Eustachian tube is quite small, easily congested with inflammation and se- cretions, and fairly horizontal, meaning poorly self drain- ing: raising the head of the mattress, sleeping propped up, will therefore reduce pressure in the middle ear and promote drainage. Eustachian tube = inflamed and fills with mucous secretions, especially if large adenoids prevent drainage Prevention of ear infection and initial treatment there- fore include hypertonic saline nasal spray to unplug and drain the Eustachian tubes and clear the adenoids. Expectorants like Mucinex \"Cold & Stuffy Nose \" or most- ly diluted HONEY , will help to loosen the secretions. Homeopathic cough syrups like Chestal or B&T can also help. Ibuprofen is for pain and anti -inflammatory effect. Homeopathic medicines can also be very effective. Anti- biotics are rarely needed but can be necessary * * * In children, the most common and difficult symptom is cough, and complications include earache and some- times ear infection: SLEEP = Children need a steady and consistent sleep routines at all ages, taught and implemented by par- ents . Optimal Sleep requirements: 2 yr = 12 hours 4 yr = 11 hours 6 yr = 10.5 hours 8 yr = 10 hours 10-12 yr = 9.5 hours 14-16 yr = 9 hours Major myth = children do not go to bed when they are tired; parents need to teach proper routines. Clinical tip = if children stay up beyond their necessary bedtime, they are in an adrenaline -driven \"fight - mode \", equivalent to drinking 2 Espressos (!), and falling asleep gets more difficult. Reality check = Falling asleep immediately, in less than 10 minutes, is a clinical sign of sleep deprivation. ZINC = helps the body to fight viruses and bacteria, and help skin to heal (zinc oxide for diaper rash). Sev- eral studies have shown a preventive effect against severe bacterial infections in children, and an increas- ing effect on antibiotic treatment in pneumonias. Re- cent studies in 2012 in France showed how white blood cells use zinc to destroy bacteria and viruses, and new generations of antibiotics and antiviral drugs will likely use this concept. Hard to find in children 's diet who do not eat enough red meat or whole grains. Added to baby cereals and good multivitamins (Centrum Kids, non -gummy Flint- stone Complete) PROBIOTICS = used in Europe for decades, in yogurt or supplements. Initial studies on infants in daycare for prevention of diarrhea showed significant reduc- tion of runny nose, ear infections and use of antibi- otics. Repeat study in older children confirmed signifi- cant reduction of days missed from cold and flu symp- toms, fever, use of antibiotics for complications. Im- munity starts in the gut, and in Chinese medicine sinus congestion comes from weak colon. Dose is increased when upset GI tract, from diarrhea to IBS, and the prevention of winter \"stomach flu \", including Rotavirus, and \"traveler 's diarrhea \" is very effective. "}
