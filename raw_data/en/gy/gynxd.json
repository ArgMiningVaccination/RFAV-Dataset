Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent BIOPESTICIDES REGISTRATION ACTION DOCUMENT TEAM Office of Pesticide Programs: Biopesticides and Pollution Prevention Division Biochemical Pesticides Branch (BPB) Sheryl K. Reilly, Ph.D. Biologist, Branch Chief Linda Hollis Microbiologist, Team Leader Russell S. Jones, Ph.D. Senior Biologi st, Health Effects/Non-target Organism s Todd A. Peterson, Ph.D. Biologist, Regulatory Action Leader Denise Greenway Environm ental Protection Specialist, New A.I. Team Captain Richard King Biologist, Regulatory Action Leader 4 Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration quinoa are classified as a biochem ical pesticide because: 1) they are derived from a seed extract from the plant Chenopodium quinoa (Willd) and 2) have a \"non\u00ad toxic\" m ode of action. C. quinoa (Willd) is a species within the plant fam ily or Pigweed ately 1300 species of chenopods worldwide, ranging from annual herbs to trees. Spinach, beets, sugar beets, chard and epazote are m embers of Chenopodiaceae with a high econom ic value. Seeds from C. quinoa are used as a cereal crop, yet because of this plant's grass-like appearance it is classified botanically as a \"pseudocereal.\" Seeds of C. quinoa , com monly referred to as quinoa, have a long history in South Am erica as a dietary supplem ent. The plants have been cultivated in the Andean highlands since 3,000 B.C. (Tapia 1982). In the Quechua language of the Incas, quinoa is chisiya mama or \"mother grain.\" In Spanish, is quinoa, trigo inca, or arroz del Peru . Nutrition from quinoa is based on its am ino acid com position, high content of calcium , phosphorus, iron, and low sodium content. Chem ically, saponins include a range of related com pounds. The saponins of Chenopodium quinoa that are the technical grade active ingredient (TGAI) and the subject of this registration action docum ent, are the m ajor saponin constituents in the extract of C. quinoa seeds, prim arily include The pesticide end product (EP), Heads Up\u00ae Plant Protectant, m ade with the TGAI is intended for use as a seed treatm ent on tuber (e.g. potato seed pieces), legum e, and cereal seeds or as a pre-plant root dip for roots of transplants, at planting, to prevent fungal growth, bacterial growth, and viral plant diseases. The EP is also intended to be used as a single-application foliar treatm ent on tom ato seedlings prior to transplant. The Biopesticides and Pollution Prevention Division (BPPD) risk m anagem ent decision regarding the registration of saponins of C. quinoa is based on: 1) the TGAI is naturally occurring, 2) applications of these saponins are \"non-food uses\" when m ade to tuber (e.g. potato seed pieces), legum e, cereal seeds, and for foliar (one tim e only) applications to im mature, non\u00ad flowering, tom ato seedlings prior to transplanting, 3) the TGAI as used in the EP does not require a tolerance 4) saponins from C. quinoa have a very low m ammalian toxicity, 5) no edible commodity is present at the tim e of pesticide product application; and 6) no detectible product residues will be present at the tim e of harvest. Residues of saponins from C. quinoa rapidly degrade within a few days of application. BPPD considered saponins of C. quinoa in light of the relevant safety factors in the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) of 1996 and under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and has not identified any dietary or non-dietary exposure issues that m ay affect the U.S. population in general, including infants and children. The Agency has thereby determ ined that there is reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to saponins of C. quinoa residues, including dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable inform ation. 5 Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent II.

Seeds or roots are to be dipped (subm erged for sixty seconds) or sprayed with solution until thoroughly covered. Foliar application, spayed until leaves are com pletely wet, is m ade once to im mature tom ato seedlings, up to 6 inches tall, pre-flowering, up to 4 days before transplanting. 6 Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent Timing: Applications are m ade: 1) before tubers or seeds are planted, 2) to roots at transplanting of seedlings, or 3) to foliage up to 4 days before transplanting seedlings. Use Practice Limitations: For tubers and seeds at seeding and for root dip or foliar application to tom ato seedlings at transplant. For foliar treatm ent of tom ato seedlings, apply only one tim e to im mature (up to six inch tall), pre-flowering, seedlings up to 4 days prior to transplanting. Foliar applications are to be m ade inside a greenhouse or outside within portable spray cham bers when pre-transplant applications are conducted in the field. Foliar application to other food or feed crops is prohibited. C. ESTIMATED USAGE None used yet since this is the first registered product. D. DATA REQUIREMENTS The Biopesticides and Pollution Prevention Division (BPPD) reviewed data requirem ents for granting this registration under Section 3(c)(5) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). The product analysis and m anufacturing process data requirem ents are adequately satisf ied by the data subm itted by the registrant f or the technical grade active ingredient and the end product (see Table 1). Physical and Chem ical Properties for the end use product are adequately satisfied by the data subm itted as listed in Table 2. The m ammalian toxicology requirem ents were satisfied by data subm itted for acute toxicity and prim ary irritation (see Table 3). Ecological effects data requirem ents for saponins of Chenopodium quinoa were fulfilled by subm ission of waiver requests supported by over 150 refereed journal article citations (MRIDs 463536-11 & -12) pertaining to toxicity and non-target organism s. The Agency reviewed all of the data and waiver requests and determ ined that they adequately satisfy current guideline requirem ents. The Agency issued a product registration for Heads Up\u00ae Plant Protectant, EPA Registration Num ber 81853-1, on Septem ber 16, 2005. In granting this product registration, the Agency does not foresee any unreasonable adverse effects to hum ans and the environm ent from any of the uses of saponins of C. quinoa when used as directed by the product labeling. E. REGULATORY HISTORY Heads Up\u00ae Plant Protectants, Inc. subm itted an application f or the registration of Heads Up\u00ae Plant Protectant, EPA Registration Num ber 81853-1, active ingredient saponins of Chenopodium quinoa on August 27, 2004. A notice of receipt of an application for registration of Heads Up\u00ae Plant Protectant, containing saponins of Chenopodium quinoa as an active ingredient, was published in the Federal Register on Decem ber 15, 2004 (69 FR 75063) with a 30-day com ment period. No com ments were received following this publication. Saponins of C. quinoa is a new active ingredient for a pesticide form ulation. The registered end product (EP) is intended to be 7 Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent biochem ical seed treatm ent (tuber, legum e, (i.e., tomato seedlings), and single-application foliar treatm ent for seedlings prior to transplanting (i.e., tom ato seedlings). Applications are m ade to m itigate fungal growth, bacterial growth, and viral plant disease in tuber, legum e, cereal seeds and tom ato transplants. An unconditional registration for this active ingredient was issued on Septem ber 16, 2005. F. CLASSIFICATION On Septem ber 7, 2000, the Biochem ical ined that can be classified as a biochem ical pesticide due to its apparent non-toxic mode of action. However, additional inform ation is needed to further clarify the m ode of action. Many saponins are known to be toxic. The m ode of action for saponins of Chenopodium quinoa remains an open issue because they appear to exhibit characteristics of a fungicidal nature. To amend the uses for saponins of C. quinoa to include food use, additional data (e.g., additional toxicological and residue data) will be required. G. FOOD CLEARANCES/TOLERANCES This end product registration is for non-food use and no food clearances or tolerances are required due to the non-food status of the current registered uses. 8 Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent III. Science Assessment A. PHYSICAL/CHEMICAL PROPERTIES ASSESSMENT All product chem istry data requirem ents for registration of saponins form ulated into the end-use product Heads Up\u00ae Plant Protectant, have been satisfied. 1. Product Identity and Mode of Action a. Product Identity Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa are a cream beige powder with a m eaty odor characteristic of finely ground proteinaceous m aterial. The saponins are derived by an extraction from seeds of C. quinoa . The m ajor saponin constituents in the extract saponins acid, hederagenin, and phytolaccagenic acid) are together the active ingredient in the end-use product Heads Up\u00ae Plant Protectant. The descriptions of the product form ulation and production process as well as the form ation of impurities were exam ined by the Agency and found to be acceptable in m eeting current guideline standards. A prelim inary analysis of saponins of C. quinoa was conducted using five batches of end use product by an independent laboratory and determ ined to be acceptable by the Agency. The analytical results were used to set the nom inal concentrations and certif ied lim its of the active ingredient. The analytical m ethod is a high perform ance liquid chrom atography (HPLC) m ethod that involves quantitation of the total saponins in the product. b. Mode of Action Heads Up\u00ae Plant Protectant inhibits fungal growth, b acterial growth, and viral plant diseases. 2.

HUMAN HEALTH ASSESSMENT The m ammalian toxicity studies subm itted to support the registration application for saponins of Chenopodium quinoa adequately satisfy the requirem ents to register a new biochem ical pesticide intended for non-food use pattern. The Agency has determ ined that this use pattern (specifically, on seeds, root system s of tom ato seedlings at transplanting, or foliage of young, up to 6 inch tall, non-flowering tom ato transplant seedlings), in relation to the inform ation in the current database, qualifies as a non-food use. 1. Toxicology Assessment Adequate m ammalian toxicology data are available to support registration of non-food products containing the new active ingredient saponins of C. quinoa . No additional toxicological data are needed. a. Acute Toxicity Acute toxicity studies are sum marized in Table 3 below. This product is in Toxicity Category IV for acute oral, acute derm al toxicity, and pr imary derm al irritation, Toxicity Category III for acute inhalation toxicity and prim ary eye, and is not a derm al sensitizer. Based on the review and analysis of the inform ation, guideline studies and subm itted literature, discussed in detail in this section of the BRAD, no additional toxicity data are required to support the non-food uses of this biochem ical. 12 Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent Table 3.

Mutagenicity and Developmental Toxicity Requested waivers of the m ammalian m utagenicity and teratogenicity data requirem ents were granted by the Agency because the known exposure of Chenopodium quinoa seed products in the hum an diet and the non-food use m ake it unlikely that the pre-existing dietary exposure of humans saponins to C. quinoa would be increased by the use of the EP. Based on the use 13 Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum treatm ent, root dip, and pre-transplant application foliar treatm ent of tom ato seedlings, non-occupational exposure to hum ans will be unlikely. Personal protective equipm ent (PPE) statem ents requiring the use of gloves and long- sleeved clothing and protective eyewear (when applying the product as a spray), will prevent derm al and eye exposure to applicators and worker s. Indirect exposure via spray drift is also mitigated by label directions restricting spray applications to inside greenhouses or outside within portable spray cham bers when pre-transplant applications are conducted in the field. There will be no non-occupational exposure. The active ingredient is not a m utagen nor is it related to any known classes of m utagens. Saponins, in general, are known to have anticarcinogenic properties (Li et al., 2002; Rao and Sung, 1995) and to stim ulate the im mune system (Kenarova et al., 1990; W u et al., 1990). A teratogenicity study is not required. The end use product when used as a pre-plant seed treatm ent, pre-transplant root dip, or pre-transpla nt foliar treatm ent of tom ato seedlings is not expected to result in significant exposure to fem ale hum ans. Use of the product does not require a tolerance or an exem ption from the requirem ent of a tolerance, nor does it require the issuance of a food additive regulation. The product is intended for non-food use. Saponins have generally been reported to have both negative (abortifacient, antizygotic, and anti-im plantation properties) and positive (increased sperm viability and m otility) effects on anim al reproduction (Francis et al., 2002). There are no specific te ratogenicity data on triterpenoid saponins of Chenopodium quinoa . Triterpenoid saponins (such as those present in the active ingredient) are present in m any plants used for hum an food (Oakenfull, 1981) without any reports of adverse effects. c. Subchronic Toxicity and Immunotoxicity Waivers requested for the subchronic and im munotoxicity study requirem ents were ar e not required as described below. The end use product is applied only once, prior to planting seeds or as a pre-transplant root dip or as a single-application foliar treatm ent for tom ato seedlings. Growth dilution by the plants and rapid biodegradation of the product will reduce any potential product residues to non- detectable levels before any consum able com modity is present. The product label states that treated seeds (i.e., potato tuber, legum e, cereal) and seedlings m ay not be used for anim al feed. Furtherm ore, any potential saponin residues resulting from use of the product m ay be indistinguishable from saponins already present in the treated plants or seeds. Saponins are widely distributed in diverse plant species (Oakenfull, 1981). Triterpenoid saponins (such as those present in the active ingredient) are com mon in cultivated crops (Oakenfull, 1981) regularly consum ed by hum ans. 14 Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent The product will not be intentionally applied to hum an skin. A label PPE statem ent to require the use of gloves and long-sleeved clothing will prevent any repeated derm al exposure to applicators and workers via application as a pre-pl ant seed treatm ent, pre-transplant root dip, or pre-transplant foliar application. There will be no occupational exposure. d. Chronic Exposure and Oncogenicity Assessment Repeated dose studies are conditionally required if the potential for adverse chronic effects are indicated based on: 1) the subchronic effect le vels established in Tier I subchronic oral, inhalation, or derm al studies, 2) the pesticide use pattern, or 3) the frequency and the level of repeated hum an exposure that is expected. Oncogenicity studies are required only if the active ingredient or any of its m etabolites, degradation products, or im purities produced in Tier I studies any m orphologic effects in any organ that potentially could lead to neoplastic changes. None of the results of the subm itted studies triggered the need for chronic exposure or oncogenicity testing. e. Effects on the Endocrine System The US Environm ental Protection Agency (Agency) is required under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosm etics Act (FFDCA), as am ended by Food Quality Protection Act, to develop a screening program to determ ine whether certain substances (including all pesticide active and other ingredients) \"m ay have an effect in hum ans that is sim ilar to an effect produced by a naturally-occurring estrogen, or other such endocrine effects as the Adm inistrator m ay designate.\" Following the recom mendations of its Endocrine Disruptor Testing Advisory Com mittee (EDSTAC), EPA determ ined th at there was scientific basis for including, as part of the program , the androgen- and thyroi d-horm one system s, in addition to the estrogen horm one system . EPA also adopted EDSTAC's recom mendation that the Program include evaluations of potential ef fects in wildlif e. For pesticide chem icals, the Agency will use FIFRA and, to the extent that effects in wildlife m ay help determ ine whether a substance m ay have an effect in hum ans, FFDCA authority to require the wildlife evaluations. As the science develops and resources allow, screening of additional horm one system s may be added to the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP). Based on the weight of the evidence of available data, no endocrine system -related effects have been identified for saponins of Chenopodium quinoa and none is expected since it does not share any structural sim ilarity to any known endocrine disruptor. 2. Dose Response Assessment No toxicological endpoints were identified; therefore, a dose response assessm ent was not required. 15 Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent 3. Dietary Exposure and Risk Characteriz ation Current dietary exposure to seeds from Chenopodium quinoa includes its use as a cereal crop. Seeds of C. quinoa , com monly referred to as quinoa, have a long history in South Am erica as a dietary supplem ent. The plants have been cultivated in the Andean highlands since 3,000 B.C. (Tapia 1982). Nutrition from quinoa is based on its am ino acid com position, high content of calcium , phosphorus, iron, and low sodium content. The end use product will be applied only once, pre-planting to seeds as a seed dip or as a spray, as a pre-transplant seedling root dip, or as a pre-transplant foliar spray to tom ato seedlings with specific requirem ents as to the size and age of the plant. Dietary exposure from its non-food use in Heads Up\u00ae Plant Protectant is expected to be insignificant. 4. Occupational, Residential, School and D ay Care Exposure and Risk Characteriz ation a. Occupational Exposure and Risk Characteriz ation Occupational exposure to saponins of C. quinoa is m itigated as long as the end-use product Heads Up\u00ae Plant Protectant is used according to label directions. Occupational exposures are not included under the FFDCA in the assessm ent of aggregate exposures for the purpose of establishing tolerances and exem ptions from tolerance. The signal word on the EP label is \"Caution\" and precautionary statem ents include \"Causes m oderate eye irritation. Harm ful if inhaled. Avoid contact with eyes or clothi ng. Avoid breathing spray m ist. Wash thoroughly with soap and water after handling. Rem ove and wash contam inated clothing before reuse.\" for routes of exposure. Indirect occupational exposure via spray drift is unlikely due to label directions restricting spray applications to in side greenhouses or outside within portable spray cham bers when pre-plant applications are conducted in the field. The product is registered for agricultural use and a reentry interval of 12 hours is required. b. Residential, School and Day Care Exposure and Risk Characteriz ation Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa is intended for agricultural use only. Although accidental non-dietary exposure m ay occur, the health risk is expected to be m inimal due to the low concentration of saponins in the product, lack of oral and derm al toxicity, m inimal acute inhalation toxicity, and m inimum potential for eye and derm al irritation. Significant hum an exposure to saponins of C. quinoa is highly unlikely in residential, school and day care areas. 5. Drinking Water Exposure and Risk Characteriz ation No significant exposure is expected from an accum ulation of saponins of Chenopodium quinoa in the aquatic environm ent when used according to the product label directions. Low application 16 Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent rates ( 10 g product/A or < 5 g active ingredient/A) and rapid biodegradation (3-5 days; Molgaard et al., 2000) further reduce potential exposure. 6. Acute and Chronic Dietary Risks for Sensit ive Subpopulations Particularly Infants and Children FFDCA section 408 provides that the Agency shall apply an additional tenfold m argin of exposure (safety) for infants and children in the case of threshold effects to account for pre- and post-natal toxicity and the com pleteness of the database unless the Agency determ ines that a different m argin of exposure (safety) will be safe for infants and children. Margins of exposure (safety) are often referred to as uncertainty (safet y) factors. In this instance, based on all the available inform ation, the Agency has concluded that there is reasonable certainty that no harm to infants and children or adults will result from the use of saponins of Chenopodium quinoa as registered. 7. Aggregate Exposure from Multiple Routes Including Dermal, Oral, and Inhalation There is reasonable certainty that no harm to the US population will result from aggregate exposure to residues of saponins of Chenopodium quinoa . This includes all exposures for which there is reliable inform ation. The Agency arrived at this conclusion based on the low level of toxicity and already widespread exposure to saponins of C. quinoa without any reported adverse effects on hum an health. The risks from aggreg ate exposure via oral, derm al and inhalation exposure are a com pilation of three low-risk exposure scenarios and are negligible. Since there are no threshold effects of concern, the provision requiring an additional m argin of safety does not apply. Therefore, the Agency has not used a m argin of exposure (safety) approach to assess the safety of saponins of C. quinoa . 8. Cumulative Effects When used as proposed, residues of saponins of Chenopodium quinoa will not reach levels that are of toxicological concern. Because of its low inherent toxicity and low use rates, no cumulative effect with other toxins is anticipated. 9. Risk Characteriz ation The Agency considered hum an exposure to saponins of Chenopodium quinoa in light of the relevant safety factors in FQPA and FIFRA. A determ ination has been m ade that no unreasonable adverse effects to the U.S. population in general, and to infants and children in particular, will result from the use of saponins of C. quinoa when label instructions are followed. 17 Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent C.

Ecological Effects Haz ard Assessment Non-target organism studies (OPPTS 850.2100 a nd 850.2200) were of studies, registrant subm itted two sum mary reports (MRIDs 463536-11 and -12) that contain literature reviews on the health, toxicological, and environm ental effects of saponins obtained from a num ber of plant sources, including Chenopodium quinoa entitled Quinoa Saponin Toxicol ogy (MRID 463536-11) briefly discusses the occurrence, biological activity, toxicity, food use, and ecotoxicity of several classes of saponins, including saponins of C. quinoa , based on data found in the public literature. A list of 74 pertinent references is included. The second report (MRID 463536-12) includes results of a literature search on the structure, biological ac tivity, toxicity, and biodegradation of saponins, with som e inform ation particular to saponins of C. quinoa . A list of 65 pertinent references is included. The Tier I Non-Target Organism Data requirem ents are discussed below. Avian toxicity studies (OPPTS 850.2100 and 850.2200) were not subm itted, but none are required based on the unlikelihood of exposure of saponins of C. quinoa to bird species from the subject pesticide uses. Seeds of treated com modities will be treated prior to planting and covered with soil at planting and will be unavailable f or consum ption by birds. Since there are no known bird pests of tom ato seedlings, pre-transplant (treated) tom ato seedlings are unlikely to be consum ed by birds. Furtherm ore, seeds and seedlings treated with the product will have a bitter taste im parted by the saponins of C. quinoa and m ay be unattractive for consum ption by birds. The product is not intended for direct appli cations to birds. Indirect exposure to birds via spray drift is unlikely due to label use directions restricting spray applications to inside greenhouses or outside within portable spray cham bers when pre-plant applications are conducted in the field (as indicated on product label). Low application rates ( 10 g product/A or <5g active ingredient/A) and rapid biodegradation (3-5 days; Molgaard et al., 2000) further reduce potential exposure. Little data are available regarding the toxicity of triterpenoid quinoa saponins to birds. Weight gain and survival of broiler chicks adm inistered a diet consisting solely of raw quinoa seed was significantly reduced after 28 days, relative to birds fed wheat, sorghum or m aize (Im prota and Kellem s, 2001). However, the authors attribute low survival rates and low weight gain to significantly reduced food consum ption caused by food aversion to the saponins in the diet. Conversely, Miah et al. (2004) reported im proved growth and m eat quality of m ale broiler chickens fed up to 75 m g of an unidentified saponin in a diet of m aize/soybean m eal. A mixture of six unidentified saponins extracted from the highly poisonous plant Alfom being fed to 1-week old chicks at 2% of their body weight (W illiam s, 1978), although these saponins are unlikely to be the triterpenoid 18 Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent saponins typically found in edible crop plants. An ECOTOX search did not report any saponin toxicity data for birds. Saponins are widely distributed in diverse plan t species (Francis et al., 2002). Triterpenoid saponins (such as those present in the active ingredient) are com mon in cultivated crops (Oakenfull, 1981). Therefore, bird exposure to naturally-occurring saponins in plants is likely to be widespread. Freshwater fish and aquatic invert ebrate 850.1035) were not itted, but none are required based on the unlikelihood of exposure of saponins of C. quinoa to these taxa. Some saponins are known to be toxic [24-hr LD 50s ranging from 4.4 (moderately toxic) to 12.5 m g/L (slightly toxic) ] to fish and aquatic invertebrates, including mosquito larvae (D' Souza et al., 2002; Lam bert et al, 1991; Lem ma et al., 1991; Molgaard et al., 2004; W eisman and 2003) prim arily due to effects on respiratory membranes (Francis et al., 2002), whereas other saponins only stun fish tem porarily (Cannon et al., 2004). A brine shrim p lethality assay is used as a crude bioassay for the presence of saponin activity (D' Souza et al., 2002). A mixture of saponins derived from Endod berry ( Phytolacca dodecandra ), a relative of pokeweed, are a potent m olluscicide (Lam bert et al., 1991). Endod saponins were com prised prim arily of m onodesm osides of oleanolic acid (Lam bert et al., 1991). There are no specific data available regarding the toxicity of bidesm oside triterpenoid quinoa saponins to fish and aquatic invertebrates, although bidesm osides have been shown to be less toxic than m ondesm osides (Duncan, 1985; Hostettm an et al., 1982). Regardless of the toxicity of som e saponins to fish and aquatic invertebrates, the end use product is not intended f or direct application to aquatic environm ents. Spray drif t will be m itigated by label use directions restricting spray applications to inside greenhouses or within portable spray cham bers when applications are conducted to seeds or pre-transplant seedlings in the field. Although the product is highly water soluble, runo ff of product active ingredient into aquatic environm ents from treated seeds or washing off of treated tom ato transplants is highly unlikely due to: 1) low application rates ( 10 g product/A or < 5 g active ingredient/A); and 2) rapid biodegradation in water (3-5 days; Molgaard et al., 2000). An ECOTOX literature search provided the following saponin m ortality data for shrim p, prawn, and daphnids (no specific toxicity data were av ailable for triterpenoid quinoa saponins) as shown in Table Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent Table 4. Information from ECOTOX Literature Search Species (Com mon nam e; Habitat) LC50/EC 50 (ppm ); exposure shrim p; studies (OPPTS 850.4100) were not required. No plant toxicity was observed in any product efficacy trials conducted by the registrant (see MRID 463536-13: Com pilation 20 Saponins of Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent plants and triterpenoid saponins (such as those present in the active ingredient) are com mon in many cultivated crops (Fenwick et al. 1991). The product is not intended for use on forests or grasslands. Spray drif t will be m itigated by label directions restricting spray applications to inside greenhouses or outside within portable spray cham bers when applications are m ade to seeds or pre-transplant seedlings in the field. Non-target insect studies (OPPTS 850.3030and 850.3040) were not required. The C. quinoa plant is susceptible to attack by m any insect pests from seed germ ination through harvest (Hellin an, 2005; Oelke et al., 2001 & 2003; Yabar et al., 2002) demonstrating that insects are already widely e xposed to triterpenoid quinoa saponins and are not adversely affected by the saponin content of the plants. Available inform ation suggests that saponins are toxic to larval form s of aquatic insects, but not adults (Francis et al., 2002), due to effects on respiratory m embranes. An ECOTOX search reported the following saponin m larval 50 = 58 ppm . The product is not intended for direct application to insects or aquatic environm ents where certain insect species m ay breed. The product is applied as a pre-plant seed and root dip or as a pre-tansplant foliar spray (restricted to inside greenhouses or other enclosures) treatm ent for tom ato seedlings. Therefore, there will be no inadvertent direct application to insects and no indirect application to insects via spray drift. 2. Environmental Fate and Ground Water Data There are no specific data regarding the degradation of saponins of Chenopodium quinoa in the environm ent. In a study conducted by Molgaard et al. (2000), biodegradability of endod (Phytolacca dodecandra ) saponins, evaluated. The freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata and red blood cells were used as a bioassays to m easure saponin potency, in conjunction with an HPLC m ethod to quantitatively assess saponin levels in \"clean\" water or river water (from the Guruve River in Zim babwe). Using the hem olysis (red blood cell) bioassay, saponins extracted with water from endod berries (at initial concentrations of 15, 30, 75 and 150 m g/L) were observed to be stable for two days, then degraded rapidly between Days 3 and 4 in both clean and river water. In the sam e aquaria, snail survival in clean water was 0% on Day 0, approxim ately 40% on Day 4, and 100% on Days 9 to 30; in river water, survival was 0% on Day 0, approxim ately 60% on Day 4, approxim ately 80% on Day 9, and 100% on Days 23 to 30. Snail m ortality ranged from LC 50 = 6.8 to 9.6 m g/L. In a second study, HPLC analysis of clean water dem onstrated sim ilar decreases in saponin concentrations over tim e, regardless of initial concentration (15, 35, or 75 m g/L) and the decreases were in agreem ent with decreases in saponin potency as m easured with the hem olysis assay. In this study, initial saponin concentrations of 15 m g/L and 75 m g/L declined to non-detectable levels in 5 and 11 days, respectively. A third study using Organizati on for Econom ic Co-operation and Developm ent (OECD) 301 F protocols, dem onstrated that endod saponins had a half-life of 15.8 hours in activated sludge. 21 Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent Based on the above studies, it is highly unlikely that non-target organism s, especially aquatic organism s, will be exposed to potentially toxic levels of saponins via runoff and/or m ovem ent through the soil, based on: 1) rapid biodegradation in soil and water (3-5 days), and 2) low application rates (< 5 m g a.i./A), which are below the LC 50s for m ost organism s reported in the literature. 3. Ecological Exposure and Risk Characteriz ation The potential for exposure to non-target wildlife is m inimal. Based on the results of the studies cited above, it is highly unlikely that non-target organism s will be exposed to potentially toxic levels of saponins due to: (i) rapid biodegradation in soil and water (3-5 days); and (ii) low application rates (< 5 m g a.i./A) which will likely result in environm ental concentrations that are well below the LC 50s for all organism s reported in the literature. D. EFFICACY DATA Efficacy data (MRID 463536-13) were subm itted in support of label claim s and product perform ance. Subm ission of product perform ance data (Efficacy Trials, OPPTS 810.300) is listed as a requirem ent for all pesticide products. However, custom arily the Agency only requires this data to be subm itted for review in connection with the registration of products directly pertaining to the m itigation of disease bearing hum an health organism s and certain designated Quarantine Pests, i.e., ticks, m osquitoes, fleas, Mediterranean fruit flies, Gypsy Moths, Japanese Beetles and etc. In this case, the registrant subm itted summaries of eight field studies (MRID 463536-13) conducted to evaluate the efficacy of som e saponins of Chenopodium against various diseases of legum es, cereals, potatoes, and tomatoes. Depending on the study, saponins of C. quinoa was applied as a seed treatm ent, a foliar treatm ent, a root dip, or som e com bination thereof. Studies were conducted in Canada and Michigan. Generally, saponins of C. quinoa decreased the incidence of som e diseases, accom panied by an increase in yield, on som e crops. There were no reports of phytotoxicity in any of the treated crops. Also, the Agency determ ined during this review process that these efficacy trials are inconclusive because of various deficiencies: certain form ulations of the end use product, saponins of C. quinoa were not adequately described; som e trial sum maries did not include specific application rates and tim ing of applications; and certain application m ethods used in efficacy trials were not conducted according to the use directions proposed on the product label, i.e. in-furrow spray treatm ents and multiple post-em Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent IV. Risk Management Decision A. DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR REGISTRATION Section 3(c)5) of FIFRA provides for the registrati on of new active ingredients if it is determ ined that (A) its com position is such as to warrant the proposed claim s for it; (B) its labeling and other materials required to be subm itted com ply with the requirem ents of FIFRA; (C) it will perf orm its intended function without unreasonable adverse effects on the environm ent; and (D) when used in accordance with widespread and com monly recognized practice it will not generally cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environm ent. To satisfy criteria \"A\" above, saponins of Chenopodium quinoa products are not expected to cause unreasonable adverse effects when used according to label instructions. Criteria \"B\" is satisfied by the current label and the data presented in this docum ent. It is believed that this pesticidal active ingredient will not cause any unreasonable adverse effects, is a fungicide, and does provide protection as claim ed satisfying Criteri a \"C.\" Criteria \"D\" was satisfied by the data presented in the initial registration of this biochem ical. Therefore, saponis of C. quinoa are eligible for registration. B. REGULATORY POSITION 1. Unconditional Registration All of the data requirem ents are fulfilled and B PPD granted an unconditional registration for the active ingredient, saponins of Chenopodium quinoa . Tolerance Establishment The uses of saponins of C. quinoa have been determ ined to be \"non-food\" uses and therefore do not require the establishm ent of a food tolerance or an exem ption from the requirem ents of a tolerance. 2. CODEX Harmoniz ation Not applicable because all of the uses have been determ ined to be non-food. 3. Nonfood Registrations There are no issues at this tim e. 23 Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent 4. Risk Mitigation There are no significant risk issues identified fo r dietary risk, residential risk, or ground and surface water contam ination. Mitigation m easures for occupational routes of exposure are required in that m ixers and applicators are required to wear additional PPE (protective eyewear) for spray applications. Indirect exposure via spray drift is also m itigated by label directions restricting spray applications to inside greenhouses or outside within portable spray cham bers when pre-transplant applications are m ade in the field. Risk to nontarget organism s will be mitigated by appropriate label precautions. 5. Endangered Species Statement Based on the inform ation discussed above, the Agency has determ ined that registered use of saponins of hederagenin, and phytolaccagenic acid) as it' s active ingredient, will have No Adverse Effects (NAE) on threatened and/or endangered species. When the product is used according to label use directions, there are no concerns for any non-target organism s. C. LABELING RATIONALE The Agency's position is that the labeling for the product containing saponins of C. quinoa as the active ingredient, com plies with current pesticide labeling requirem ents im posed under FIFRA and 40 CFR '156.10. 1. Human Health Haz ard a. Worker Protection Standard Any product whose labeling reasonably perm its use in the production of an agricultural plant on any farm , forest, nursery, or greenhouse, m ust com ply with the labeling requirem ents of Pesticide Registration (PR) Notice 93-7, ''Labeling Re visions Required by the W orker Protection Standard (W PS),\" and PR Notice 93-11, \"Supplem ental Guidance for PR Notice 93-7,\" requirem ents of EPA's ents (40 CFR part 156, subpart K). These labeling revisions are necessary to im plem ent the W orker Protection Standard for Agricultural Pesticides (40 CFR pa rt 170). Unless otherwise specifically directed, all statem ents required by PR Notices 93-7 and 93-11 are to be on the product label exactly as instructed in those Notices. The labels and labeling of all products m ust com ply with EPA's current regulations and requirem ents as specified in 40 CFR 156.10 and other applicable notices, such as, and including the W PS labeling. Uses of the end-use product containing saponins of Chenopodium quinoa are subject to the requirem ents of W PS, and as such it has the appropriate language as required by the standard. 24 Saponins of Chenopodium quinoa Biopesticides Registration Action Docum ent For uses of this product that are covered by the W orker Protection Standard (W PS), worker entry into treated areas is not allowed during the restricted entry interval of 12 hours. The PPE requirem ent for early entry to treated areas that is perm itted under the W PS and that involves contact with anything that has been treated, such as plants, soil, or water, is coveralls, protective eyewear, waterproof gloves, and shoes plus socks. b. Non-Worker Protection Standard There are no non-worker (non-m ixer/loader/applicator) hum an health hazard issues. c. Precautionary Labeling The Agency has exam ined the toxicological data base for saponins of Chenopodium quinoa and has concluded that the precautionary labeling (i.e., Signal W ord, First Aid statem ent, and other label statem ents) listed on the label (See Appendix A - Product Label) adequately m itigates the risks associated with the currently registered uses. The following Personal Protective Equipm ent Language (PPE) and the User Safety Recom mendations Box im mediately below the Precautionary Statem follows: \"Personal Protective Equipm ent (PPE): Appli cators and handlers m ust wear long-sleeved shirt and long pants, shoes, socks, and waterproof gloves. For spray applications, applicators m ust protective eyewear. Follow the m anufacturer's instructions for cleaning/m aintaining PPE. If no such instructions for washables, use detergent and hot water. Keep and wash PPE separately from other laundry.\" d.

Do not apply this product to tomato seedlings when bloom s or fruits are present on the plant.\" V. Actions Required by Registrants There are no data requirem ents, label changes or other responses necessary for the reregistration of the end-use product since the product is being registered after Novem ber 1984 and is, therefore, not subject to reregistration. There ar e also no existing stocks provisions at this tim e. The Agency evaluated all of the data subm itted in connection the initial registration of saponins of Chenopodium quinoa and determ ined that these data are sufficient to satisfy current registration guideline requirem entss. Therefore, the active ingredient saponins of Chenopodium quinoa is eligible for registration. No additional data are required to be subm itted to the Agency at this tim e. Not withstanding the inform ation stated in the previous paragraph, it should be clearly understood that certain, specific, data are required to be reported to the Agency as a requirem ent for maintaining the Federal registration for a pesticide product.
