The beautiful crystal bowls emit an expansive sound that is healing for the body's deeper tissues. Evocative of ancient temples, the delightful sounds of the crystal and Tibetan bowls exude a profound healing matrix. They are grounding and help promote a stable, peaceful energy. A gong is an ideal tool for stress reduction, stimulation of the glandular system and to clear emotional blockages. The gong resonates all cells of the body simultaneously helping to bring into balance the energy centers (chakras) of the body in a most powerful and effective way.
