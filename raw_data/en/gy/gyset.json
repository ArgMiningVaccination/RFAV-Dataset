We are always available for questions or concerns at support@bryanjohnson.co Blueprint EVOO comes from farmers in both hemispheres. While they are not certified organic, we conduct extensive analyses to ensure our finished products are free of pesticides (see data below). Organic EVOO is not necessarily synonymous with quality. Our farms practice organic methods, however the certification process is costly and some of the non organic inputs are cost prohibitive to most producers. Most importantly, our Blueprint EVOO tested results replicate those of an organic option, with no detectable traces.

Radical health extension was only sci-fi. Not anymore. The speed of technological and scientific advance makes it impossible to predict how long and how well we can live. Entrance into this future is the hottest ticket around. I started Blueprint as a science experiment to explore the future of being human. My journey and protocol is openly shared and accessible to all. Here is to being our best selves and stepping into this next era together. Bryan Johnson "}
