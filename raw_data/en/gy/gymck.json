The chiropractic services at our Bellevue wellness clinic include: Chiropractic Adjustments During a chiropractic adjustment, a chiropractor applies quick, controlled pressure to specific points of the body to release joint pain and improve range of motion. Diversified Technique The diversified chiropractic focuses on restoring proper movement and alignment of the spine and joint dysfunction. Palmer Method The Palmer method focuses on manipulation of the atlas vertebrae (the first vertebrae) to help the rest of the spine fall into place. Activator Method The activator method uses an instrument to apply fast, controlled pressure to the body, instead of using hands. Drop Table Technique The drop table technique uses a sudden thrust to a patient's spinal or pelvic area, combined with the specialized chiropractic table dropping to safely realign the body with lower velocity movements than other chiropractic adjustments. SOT (Sacro Occipital Technique) SOT focuses on the connections between different muscle groups and organs to determine which parts of the body need adjustment. Scoliosis Treatment Scoliosis adjustments attempt to realign the spine into a more straightened position than can regularly be achieved by someone suffering from scoliosis. While chiropractors can not cure scoliosis, spinal adjustments can lead to reduced spinal curvature, pain, and disability. Herniated Disc Treatment The disks (or shock absorbers) of your spine can rupture and herniate. This painful condition can be treated through careful chiropractic treatments that take into account the pain and comfort levels of the patient. Vertigo Treatment In some vertigo cases, the dizziness of vertigo may be able to be treated with proper alignment of the spine. "}
