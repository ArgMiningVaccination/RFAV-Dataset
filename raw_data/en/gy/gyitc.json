Copy and paste the Senator's emails into the Bcc The Watch](https://www.drabigailseaver.com/2011/02/dr-seaver-featured-in-the-watch/) Check out a new interview with Ridgway, Colorado Naturopathic Doctor Abigail Seaver in The Watch. Dr. Seaver was featured in the 'Ask an Expert' Section. Here's an except from the article: \"Each month Watch:Nurture will feature a Q&A with a different specialist from the region who can offer insight into children's health and development issues. Here, Ridgway-based Naturopathic Doctor Abigail Seaver discusses her approach to children's wellness. Q: Why naturopathic vs. traditional Western medicine? A: I chose to study naturopathic medicine rather than allopathic medicine because naturopathic medicine's aim is to find the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and to use supportive, safe, low-force treatments to enable the body's own healing mechanisms to correct the problem. For instance, I see many children who have received repeated courses of antibiotics to treat recurrent ear or sinus infections. In many of those cases, I have found that the underlying cause of the recurrent infections is an allergy to a specific food, and when that food is eliminated from the diet and some basic nutritional supplements are prescribed to support the child's immune system, the infections cease and there is no further need for antibiotics. \" Read the full article here: [Watch Newspapers - ASK AN EXPERT Abigail Seaver Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine Ridgw](http://www.watchnewspapers.com/view/full_story/11344111/article--ASK-AN-EXPERT-Abigail-Seaver--Doctor-of-Naturopathic-Medicine--Ridgway?#ixzz1EL41juC1) [ay Colorado](http://www.watchnewspapers.com/view/full_story/11344111/article--ASK-AN-EXPERT-Abigail-Seaver--Doctor-of-Naturopathic-Medicine--Ridgway?#ixzz1EL41juC1) [Bitter Herbal Tonics](https://www.drabigailseaver.com/2011/01/bitter-herbal-tonics/) Bitter Herbal Tonics In addition to the foods discussed above I also recommend an herbal formula containing bitter herbs to stimulate the digestive tract. Bitter plants stimulate the entire digestive tract to secrete digestive juices and are best taken prior to a meal but can also be used as an antidote to a large and heavy meal. These formulas are very effective at treating gas and bloating and can be used interchangeably with an encapsulated digestive enzyme supplement with the added benefit of stimulating the production of amylase, an enzyme found in our saliva which starts breaking down starches as soon as we chew our food. I like our local Shining Mountain Herbs \"Rocky Mountain Herbal Bitters\" product which combines locally wildcrafted and organically grown herbs such as Aspen bark, Angelica root and Gentian root in a tasty formula. I usually recommend between 30 drops to one teaspoon up to three times daily before meals. This type of formula is contraindicated in acute gallbladder inflammation, intestinal blockage, for young children and in pregnancy. [Astragalus](https://www.drabigailseaver.com/2010/12/astragalus/) Speaking of roots, another root that I am quite fond of at this time of year is Astragalus membranaceus, a Chinese herb that acts as an adaptogen to protect the body from stress, and protects and supports the immune system to prevent colds and upper respiratory infections. It can be taken daily as a preventative and is safe for children. It is available in my office as a liquid tincture or capsule. If you have a medical condition or are taking any medications, please ask your doctor before adding this herb to your regimen. "}
