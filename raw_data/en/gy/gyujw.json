This ceremony took place at Government House in Canberra and was the foundation of the Australian Academy of Science. And in recognition of the Academy's contributions over the past 50 years and for those to come, I invite you to charge your glasses, stand and toast the Australian Academy of Science. Robyn Williams: And we did. Hello, I'm Robyn Williams and I happen to be a Fellow. And we shall celebrate the Academy's 50th with its current president Dr Jim Peacock, the Prime Minister and Sir Gustav Nossal shortly. We begin with an example of the kind of research that keeps Australia in the front rank around the world. In this week's journal Science, Dr. John Mattick from the University of Queensland reveals that great stretches of our human genome go back to the birds and even to the fish. This so-called junk DNA has been a mystery for years and the surprise is how little of our actual genes make proteins, as real genes are supposed to. John Mattick: The current figures for the human genome are one and a half percent; about five percent considered to be under selection because it appears to be conserved between species and the rest, yes, essentially evolutionary debris. Robyn Williams: So when you say 5% conserved between species, something over millions and millions of years that say in fish also appears in us and so one would imagine it's important. John Mattick: That's the presumption. What the paper that we've just published in Science shows is that there are thousands, thousands of sequences within the human genome that have been unchanged throughout the mammals, conserved in chickens and about half of them unchanged in fishes. This means that these sequences, whatever they're doing and they're not protein coding, they're not conventional genes, have been absolutely frozen, some of them for up to 400 million years of evolution, which suggests that they are critically important both to evolution and presumably to the growth and development of these organisms including ourselves, but nobody has the faintest idea what they do. So this is a new class of genetic elements that nobody has ever seen before and I suggest more broadly, the tip of a very, very big iceberg. Robyn Williams: And what does that iceberg do? John Mattick: Well, the conventional view of the structure of genetic systems including humans is really an extension of what we know reliably from bacteria. And that view is that genes essentially are synonymous with proteins, a gene makes a protein, and by extension then, that proteins fulfil not only the structural and functional roles in cells and organisms but are also the main agents by which the system is regulation both in real time physiologically and during our growth and development. Robyn Williams: Switching on my hormones when I'm a teenager and you know, delaying all the timing stuff? John Mattick: Yes, and that almost certainly is carried out largely by proteins. But the presumption's been made that proteins are primarily responsible for controlling the exquisitely detailed process of differentiation development in complex organisms like humans. When we came up against the human genome we found that a very, very tiny proportion of it actually encoded conventional genes, much less than people thought. People in a sense have for years assumed that the rest of it was just evolutionary debris, there's this big lumbering complex organisms, we were like New York and we'd have lots of bums and hobos in our city. Robyn Williams: Well talking about debris, I mean, how much effort does it take for the organism to maintain that complex DNA, it surely hasn't got the luxury of just carrying stuff for the sake of it? John Mattick: Well, presumably not, although I don't particularly like that argument because - I haven't done the calculation, but you probably use more energy getting out of bed in the morning than you do replicating a body's worth of DNA. You have to ask yourself more neutrally and objectively how much information is required to program a complex system? And what you can say very simply is that, as complexity increases it's the amount of regulation and control systems that really increases. So you can look at a complex system, whether it's a human or a motorcar or an aeroplane, as a combination of components, think of those as the proteins and plans for the assembly in one form or another. But the amount of information required to reproducably put those components together in an ordered is enormous. Robyn Williams: So you could actually say that that 90 odd percent of DNA is not junk, it's software? John Mattick: That's right, that's putting it very nicely. Now it's complicated by several factors - one is that about 40% of the human genome appears to be comprised of recent entries, parasites transposed onto related sequences, generally assumed to be parasitic elements but may not be, may be part of the dynamic of our own evolution and there's good information coming out including from Australian groups about that. But the other 60%, which is more ancient, we think that in fact it codes for a much, much more expanded regulatory architecture, a hidden layer so to speak. Now a few surprising facts: the first is that over 98% of all of the output of the human genome is non-coding RNA, sequences that are copied into RNA but do not code for protein. And in fact if you do the numbers you can show that at least half of the human genome is transcribed, half of it, but only one and half percent's coding for protein. So either our genomes are replete with useless transcription or these non-protein coding RNA's are fulfilling some unexpected functions and we think, to put it in a nutshell, that these form a quasi digital feed forward control system which essentially sets the trajectories for development. Now think about development for a moment, a simple worm, a nematode worm, C. elegans, which was made famous by Sydney Brenner and John Sulston. Robyn Williams: For which they got the Nobel Prize. John Mattick: They did yes, and rightly so. That comprises in the adult form about a thousands cells give or take, including the ones that are programmed cell death during situ remodelling on the way to becoming an adult worm which is basically just some muscles, a gut and a few nerves. A fruit fly you know, or an insect has a much more complex body plan and a human even more complex. And by the time you get to a human you're talking about an individual with roughly 10 to the 14th cells. It's often considered that there are a couple of hundred different cell types in a human, muscles, nerves you know, but in fact if you take positional identity into account then you're looking at a least as trillion, at least a trillion positionally identical cells. Robyn Williams: Wow. John Mattick: You think about the shape of your nose and the fingers and the muscles and the bones, every bone is different but precisely sculptured and these developmental idiosyncrasies, this positional identity is so precise that we even show the inherited idiosyncrasies of the variance in our own family tree, so your nose has a different shape to mine. So this is an exquisitely controlled process and I think it's going to turn out, in fact, quite bizarrely perhaps that what was damned as junk because it wasn't understood will turn out to be the secret of our complexity. Robyn Williams: Thank you. John Mattick: My pleasure. Robyn Williams: And Professor John Mattick's paper is published in the journal Science this week. And so to the Academy of Science and a busy week for our Prime Minister. He chose to announce on Thursday, ahead of the budget, what funds there will be for research. Later that day at short notice he appeared as the keynote speaker at the grand dinner at Parliament House in Canberra to celebrate the Academy's Golden Jubilee. Here's part of what John Howard had to say. John Howard: Some of you in this audience would have heard me say perhaps on more than one occasion, that I want to see the day in this country when the contributions of scientists are as revered and honoured by the Australian people as the contributions of our sports men and women - and I hope I bring some authority to that comparison having been properly described by Mark Taylor as 'a cricket tragic'. But it is important that on an occasion like this we say very directly to the Australian community how much we depend, as a nation and as a people, on science. The 21st Century will see the most extraordinary further advances as a consequence of science and the opportunities of all of the sciences that are represented here tonight will give to the Australia people will affect every aspect of their lives. I've just recorded an interview for the Channel 9 current affairs segment of their late evening news, Nightline and I was asked to try and explain what the extra money that we announced today was going to do. I described some of the flagship projects of CSIRO: research into food that will hopefully reduce the incidence of heart disease and cancer; the research into clean energy from coal, which has such enormous long term potential and huge ramifications for a country which is so rich in that particular resource. If we can achieve extraordinary breakthroughs in areas like that, the pre-eminence we already have as an exporter of energy is going to be greatly multiplied and the huge natural advantage we enjoy in areas like that will be even greater. And so the list goes on - and I have announced as you know today the second instalment, if I can call it that, of the Backing Australia's Ability program and I won't weary you on such an occasion with the detailed recitation of individual elements in it. But can I say the most important part is that we have in a way that I don't believe has been done in the past, we have provided a degree of long term funding certainty which is so important to research and so important to the scientific community. Now inevitably in packages of this kind there will be some areas that will be seen as having been rather more liberally funded than in others, but there has been an attempt made to recognise the central role of what many call pure science. We have placed, and I believe very properly, within the package a very high premium on commercialisation because of its importance. We have, for the first time, brought CSIRO within the Backing Australia's Ability funding envelope and the new investment to support the Flagship programs of CSIRO in the order of some $305 million I know is welcomed by that organisation and will enable it to carry out many more of the projects, examples of which I gave earlier. But in all of these things we have endeavoured to give to the sector a degree of funding certainty and funding commitment because we know the central role of your contribution for the future of this country. We rightly say that our scientists, not only our medical scientists, but all of our scientists contribute to the impression around the world that this country punches above its weight when it comes to scientific endeavour and scientific research, and for a nation of just 20 million people there are a remarkable number of its citizens both in the past and now are seen around the world as the experts in their relevant fields. And one of the things that has cheered me most is the fact that as a result of the first investment in Backing Australia's Ability and particularly in the context of the Federation Fellowships that we have seen people returning, renowned Australian scientists returning to this country and being attracted back by the increased support that has been provided. We are as a nation going through an extremely strong set of economic conditions. A major contribution has been made to the strength and the efficiency of the Australian economy by the various scientific disciplines, and without the capacity of this country to adapt - and it is one of our most enduring and endearing characteristics as a people that we can adapt and we can adjust to new circumstances, we can innovate and we can apply new knowledge to current challenges. Without the contribution of science and the remarkable performance of the Australian economy today would not have been nearly so strong. So ladies and gentlemen, can I on behalf of all of your fellow Australians, salute the Academy for the legacy that it has constantly given us over its 50 years of existence. May I pay tribute to those wonderful people who founded it who are household names, not only within the scientific community but deservedly so within the Australian community. Can I thank, on behalf of the Australian people, the contribution of Australia's current scientists. Can I express my admiration for your dedication and marvel at the willingness of many of you with comparatively little reward, in many cases for long years, to commit yourselves to your respective discipline out of a sense of professionalism and a desire to produce a better world. We are all in your debt and you will all play a major role in the further growth and development and enhancement of our nation. Thank you. Robyn Williams: The Prime Minister at the dinner celebrating 50 years of the Academy of Science. The vote of thanks came from the scientist who was President when John Howard first came to office 8 years ago. Sir Gustav Nossal. Gustav Nossal: We're truly delighted that you've honoured us with your keynote address tonight and we take pride in the fact that so many of your detailed announcements accord with the advice which the Academy was pleased to tender. What then, sir, might you expect from this Academy over its next 50 years? Well, its work will have to resonate with the great changes sweeping over the science enterprise. We can summarise these with five C's. The first is Collaboration. Interdisciplinarities are now not just the buzz word, it's an imperative for cutting edge research and moreover the need of collaborations are increasingly crossing the physics/biology divide. Look, for example, at medical biology in the post human genome project era where genome mining for new therapies requires major investments in the information science, robotics and combinatorial chemistry. The second C is Consortia - team work within a given institution will frequently not be enough and the increasing pressure for commercialisation of research results will require identification of one or more partners from industry. The Co-operative Research Centres are magnificent examples of consortia. A closely allied challenge will be to make optimal use of major national facilities, the $200 million synchroton being built at Monash University being the prime example. The third C is Comunication. It's a sad fact that only a minority of scientists take communication with the lay public seriously. As our work becomes more expensive and as the technological fruits arising from basic science become even more powerful in shaping human destiny, it behoves each and everyone of us to attempt to explain our endeavours to our fellow citizens. Most of us are proud of our work but it's difficult and technical. The effort to popularise its central core is worthwhile in a democracy like ours. The fourth C is Cohesion. The large consortia will be difficult to manage, most of the scientists within them will owe their primary allegiance to one of the member organisations, yet for Australia to be world competitive the really major thrusts, be they towards a quantum computer or a solution to the problems of the Murray Darling Basin, or a brand new approach to breast cancer or the looming epidemic of obesity and diabetes, these new thrusts will have to be disciplined and cohesive. This is a challenger in leadership. The final C is Commitment. I don't mean that we should be committed to our projects, after all we wouldn't be sitting here as Fellows of Academy without that. I mean rather a commitment to the ethos of science. It's often said that science is value free, I've always considered it to be value laden. Science depends on clarity of intellect, on curiosity about the world being decomposed into manageable bits; on hypotheses being framed and sharpened through discussion with gifted peers; on experiments designed with imagination; on results being reported accurately and objectively. The discipline required for all of this constitutes a way of life, values embedded all the way through, yet these values are under threat. Think of creationism, think of the degree to which activists of various sorts will bend the truth: Please don't confuse me with the facts my mind's made up. Think of the rise of all kinds of extreme fundamentalism. Those of us who believe that the cathedral of science is one of humanities greatest achievements must be committed to its highest standards and to its wise use. Over the next 50 years as during the last the Academy will embody that which is best in Australian science as this changes and evolves in wondrous ways. As you know, Prime Minister, the Academy is studiously non-partisan, so we pledge ourselves to work with the government of the day and with the opposition to play our part ensuring that Australian science optimally serves its citizens and the world. Again we thank you sincerely for your support and your considered remarks tonight, they've given us must hope and the platform on which Australian science can continue to build. Thank you. Robyn Williams: Sir Gustav Nossal from the University of Melbourne, a former president. The present one, Jim Peacock then made a special award and in doing so demonstrated how much the Academy still sticks to old titles. Jim Peacock: The Academy Medal recognises outstanding contributions to science by a person outside the fellowship who has, by sustained efforts in the public domain, significantly advanced the cause of science and technology in Australia, or who has made a substantial contribution to the Academy. The first recipient of this Medal tonight is Dr. Norman Swan - Norman. Norman Swan has made substantial contributions to the cause of science and technology in Australia through his wide broadcasting experience: he produces and presents the award-winning Health Report and was the host of Life Matters. Both of these are high profile programs on the Australian Broadcasting Commission's Radio National - Corporation, Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Robyn Williams had the indecency to correct that today. So, Norman Swan, I have great pleasure in awarding the Academy Medal to you. Norman Swan: Thank you. Jim, Fellows, this is a true honour not from my peers but from my betters, thank you so much indeed. I am and have always been in awe of the work that you do and particularly those of you, and it's many of you, who do fundamental, curiosity-driven research, the true engine room of innovation in science. We should never forget it. The other thank you that I should give is to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and in particular to Radio National, because some people have likened Radio National a bit to university, the bad and the good, but really what the ABC has done is nurtured a Science Unit, a group of people who are one of the last groups of such people in the world. My health program is one of the few in the world anywhere devoted to broadcasting and putting out the work that you do, and the network and the organisation has allowed us to develop, to make mistakes and to stumble and hopefully to get better and what we do. So thank you to the ABC, but particularly for this, thank you to the Academy. Thank you. Robyn Williams: Well done Norman. The other medallists are Peter Wills and Professor Rod Home. And you're listening to The Science Show on Radio National, where we turn to the kind of technology often cited by politicians as what they'd like to see more of - commercial successes. The cochlear implant has been pioneered in Australia and developed over the years to become a more and more sophisticated device. But I didn't realise how it's really been 'one size fits all' until recently. Stuart Rosen is from University College, London. Stuart Rosen: That's right, there are of course certain aspects of the stimulation that are adjusted for each patient, mostly to do with the loudness of the sounds, because we don't want sounds to be too loud or too quiet but it doesn't typically go much further than that. Robyn Williams: Can they be worn by people who have never heard or only by people who've heard once before? Stuart Rosen: If children have never heard or are implanted young enough they do incredibly well and the evidence is very good that the younger they're implanted the better they do. But if someone gets to about puberty without any hearing experience and are then implanted they really cannot seem to be able to use the implants really at all. Robyn Williams: I'd imagine that what they hear in the beginning with the cochlear implant is nothing like you and I are hearing right now. What do they hear, in fact? Stuart Rosen: No well, this of course is the great mystery - it's something that's very difficult to tell. One interesting thing is my original work was in trying to understand how normal people hear, and of course in that situation when you have a question about what it sounds like you yourself go into the room, put on the headphones and start thinking about what it sounds like, and of course we can't do that with implant patients - at least those of us who don't have implants. So it's extremely difficult for us to know what they really do hear, but what we can do is look at their behaviour and how they identify different sounds, and we can certainly understand I think, a great deal the kinds of information that get across to these patients. Robyn Williams: Which brings me to your experiments and the ways in which you can fine tune us - could you just sort of talk us through it and we'll hear some of your examples. Stuart Rosen: O.K. SFX Distorted sounds - 'The ice Robyn Williams: What was that? Stuart Rosen: Well, that was a simulation of what a cochlear implant patient might hear if their electrode was inserted about six and a half millimetres too short. The sounds are much higher frequency than they would normally be. If we imagine then, in putting the electrode in further and further we'd get a series of sounds like this. SFX Distortion lessens with repetition - 'The ice cream was pink' Robyn Williams: Ah, the ice cream was pink, I could actually make sense of that. So if you imagine the cochlear being wound, it's sort of shell-like, it's not a straight system but what you've got to do is insert it as you might indeed a twisted shell like a snail and the further it goes in presumably the better the sound. Stuart Rosen: That's exactly right, some of the low frequencies which are very important for speech are found furthest in the cochlear and also nerve survival tends to be better there, so there are two very good reasons to try to get electrodes in as far as possible. Robyn Williams: Could you take us through that again starting with the way they might have heard it in the beginning right through to our being able to perceive the sentence. Stuart Rosen: OK, so this is starting with the case where the electrode is inserted very short and then progressing through to a full insertion. SFX Distortion lessens with repetition - 'The ice cream was pink' Robyn Williams: The ice cream was pink. How did you do that? Stuart Rosen: Well, really what we're doing is analysing speech into frequency bands and then resynthesising it with bands that are at higher frequencies in the way we understand the cochlear to work. Robyn Williams: So now you can give a cochlear person a kind of training because you know what's going in and you can take them through and fine tune it for their own purposes really, so they get better and better. Stuart Rosen: Well it seems that it's better to introduce this kind of shift gradually, that people seem to learn to use the information quite a bit more quickly. Robyn Williams: How quickly indeed, roughly, how much does it improve the system? Stuart Rosen: It's hard to say really, I mean I would suppose in general when people get implants they show quite a bit of improvement typically over the first say, three months and many patients will continue to improve over the course of about a year, so if we could shorten that a bit even by a month or so, well that would be all to the better for those particular people. Robyn Williams: What about your own particular work, what is that concentrating on next? Stuart Rosen: Well, really we've been looking at other situations in which, for example, there could be groups of nerve fibres missing and whether it's better to warp the information or not. And actually we're interested in much more general issues about cochlear implants; for example, and this is something nothing to do with what I've been talking about up until now, but cochlear implants transfer information about the melody of the voice quite poorly, so of course when people talk their voice is going up and down in pitch all the time, and there's very important information in that. And the way implants work now, that information is not getting through very well and in our laboratory we've been working on techniques to try to improve the perception of the melody of voice. Robyn Williams: And would that melody perception even translate to hearing people and languages? You know, in other words, people who can't understand certain languages being able to hear better what's being said across cultures even? Stuart Rosen: Well, I think these particular things we're doing are really aimed very specifically at the kind of processing that goes on in cochlear implants. And when we talk about different kinds of languages it becomes really important in what are called tone languages like Chinese, in which the melody of your voice causes a change in the meaning of the work so if I say ma, that means mother, and if I say maa, I think that means horse or to scold. Anyway, tone languages use voice pitch in a very different way and languages like English or French and that information again is not getting through and it's quite a big handicap for users of languages like that. Robyn Williams: Your combined work, how will it improve the field in say ten years time do you think? Stuart Rosen: I think in general what we're hoping to do is find much better ways of fitting implants to individual patients and just as you might suppose that, you know, a pair of spectacles may help you even if they're fit very well, that a well-fitting pair would help you that much better. Robyn Williams: Professor Stuart Rosen is from University College, London. And in Australia at the Bionic Ear Institute in Melbourne how are they adjusting the latest generation of implants for users needs? Ellaine Downie. Ellaine Downie: When you go to get your hearing measured an audiologist will ask you to indicate when you hear a sound played to you through headphones. You probably remember that these sounds are sometimes low, sometimes high. The audiologist is not playing words or speech or music but single frequencies of sound, pure tones. The idea is that even though our ears can detect a larger range of frequencies, from 20 to 20,000 waves per second in fact, the most important ones for understanding speech seem to be in the range 250 to 4000. So if you can hear these individual frequencies you have a pretty good chance of understanding what people say to you and of learning to speak yourself. For a profoundly deaf person whose inner ear, the cochlear, is not working and who has never heard sounds, speech is virtually impossible. So the cochlear implant, which allows profoundly deaf people to actually hear some of these speech frequencies is a most amazing invention. After a deaf person has recovered from the implant operation, about a month later, they need to visit their audiologist to get the implant adjusted to suit them individually. This process is called mapping and it's very similar to having a normal hearing test. Inside the implant a bundle of wires has been inserted: each wire is a different length, so that as the bundle coils around the spiral in the cochlear's bony shell separate electrodes reach a certain distance only. It's at the end of the wire that an electrical signal is discharged And this means that signals are being produced at set positions along the cochlear spiral. Each position fires a nerve leading to a set part of the brain which is then interpreted as a high or a low. In other words, the place on the cochlear membrane where the nerves fire is an indicator of the frequency of sound. The audiologist first tests the person's ability to detect sound at each electrode, which is equivalent to testing different frequencies in a normal hearing test. They want to find the volume at which the signal can just be detected, then the procedure is repeated to detect the maximum comfortable volume for each frequency. This way, the audiologist has a set of figures showing the tolerable volume range for that person at the different speech frequencies. If a setting is wrong the signal will be too soft and the person will not be able to hear anyway, or if too loud you could blow their brains out - getting a good estimation of the comfortable range is very important. The results are then put into a computer program in the speech processor, which is the part of the device worn outside the body. Here, the microphone picks up sound, the program transforms it into electrical pulses and then sends it via radio waves into the implant in the person's head. The loudness also needs to be balanced across the frequency range, meaning that there shouldn't be one frequency - usually a high sound - which jumps out. This again relies on the implantee listening carefully as the audiologist quickly sweeps through the frequency range to check if the levels all seem to be at the same loudness. As you might imagine this is a tedious process for the implantee: lots of noises, some too loud, some to soft, done in an anechoic chamber, a dead room that's spooky enough by itself. It takes a long while to work through the 22 electrodes, especially the first time - it's a headache in more ways than one. And this isn't the end of the process. The person has to come back the next day or the next week and have it adjusted again until the audiologist gets consistent readings and is sure that the person is getting the best volume out of the implant. Although the mapping process sets general levels of volume there's also a sensitivity control on each implant which the persons themselves can use to adjust loudness in different situations, such as in a noisy restaurant or a echoey lecture theatre. The latest version of this uses an intelligent computer program called ADRO or Adaptive Dynamic Range Optimisation, which is built into the speech processor so that it does this automatically. ADRO operates on an algorithm to make sure the output of the speech processor always remains within the dynamic mapped range at least 70% of the time. The latest intelligent hearing aids also use this same idea. The ADRO system was developed in Melbourne in 2002, by the Bionic Ear Institute and the CRC for Cochlear Implant and Hearing Aid Innovation. After implant surgery physiological changes start happening around the implant inside the cochlear. Scar tissue grows over the implanted wires, for instance, and this can alter the electrical impedance, which in turn affects the amount of current needed to work the implant. So the mapping procedure has to be checked yet again. The audiologist also needs to see if there have been any other problems. Some people, for instance, find they get headaches or ringing in the ears, others find they get a tingling in their face because the facial nerves are also firing from the electrical signal. And then there is the changing perception of hearing as a person learns to interpret these new signals coming into their brain. At first these sounds don't make much sense. Imagine if you'd never heard a sound, what would you make of it the first time, a buzzing, a screech, a whistle - it would be weird. The sound section of the brain has to adjust and learn to interpret these new signals and make sense of them. As the months go by the person perceives sound better and better. This is really a process of retraining their brain - as the brain adjusts the implant may also need to be adjusted. The mapping process is particularly difficult for young children, for people with multiple disabilities and for deaf people who have never developed any spoken language. The latest implant produced by the company Cochlear, called the Nucleus 24, has an extra built-in feature, which is now assisting with this mapping process in these circumstances. During the time of mapping the support of doctors, friends and their audiologist is so important to help people to stick to the tedious process and not give up. But the effort is well rewarded when someone like Rod Saunders, the first Australian implantee, says, \"You just don't know what it's like to be deaf. I was a very musical person before my accident, afterwards I was in a world of silence with no music and no sound at all. I was isolated and extremely depressed. The cochlear implant has given me back my life.\" Robyn Williams: Ellaine Downie at the University of Melbourne, the Bionic Ear Institute there. And finally, another technology GM, genetically modified - well, you'll see. Here's Chris Smith with a surprising application. Chris Smith: Scientists recently announced that a GM plant could be used in future to combat the problem of mine fields. Land mines are undoubtedly one of the ugliest legacies of war; they lurk in the ground remaining in an active state for years and are currently claiming on average 2000 innocent victims who are killed or maimed every single month. The United Nations estimates that there are over 110 million land mines planted across 68 countries around the world and it costs as little as $3 to plant a landmine but a whopping $300 to a $1000 to remove it again safely. If you add to that the fact that the best de-mining personnel are managing to clear only 2 square metres of mine fields every single day, it's clear why the number of landmines around the world is going up and not going down. But thanks to the efforts of plant scientists in Denmark there could soon be a new tool to help tackle the problem: a genetically modified cress plant that changes colour when it grows near a landmine. From Aresa Biotech, inventor Carsten Meier now joins us to explain how it works. Carsten Meier: Basically, the plant works by changing its colour from green to red. The colour itself is anthocyanin, basically the same pigmentation as people can see in the autumn. This is accomplished by engineering the plant: we have made the plant very willing to go red. Basically, if it had the capability it would be red all the time but we're controlling the missing step, so it's only when it sees the compound that leaks out of the landmine that it has the capability of turning red. Basically, landmines are very cheaply produced and there is a common explosive in almost all landmines which is TNT. TNT is a very simple molecule which is basically a ring structure and it has three branches on it which are NO2 groups. These groups break off and become a gas and that's why they go to the surface. The root of the plant gets in contact with these substances by growing in the soil in the vicinity of the landmine. Chris Smith: How much of that gas do you need for the plant to change colour? Carsten Meier: That's one of the goals that we have to find out, because that could depend on the type of soil that the plants grow in, but we have tried to foresee that problem by making several different types of plants which basically one of them detects the NO2 and another plant line detects the raw explosives. Chris Smith: Now one thing that people are going to be concerned about, because this is a genetically modified plant - is the risk that it could spread or escape and harm the environment in some way. Now what steps have you taken to make sure that the plant can't contaminate wild type plants or start causing problems in the environment? Carsten Meier: What we've used is a naturally occurring mutant, that means a plant which has the lack of a gene, the plant is not able to produce seeds due to a lack in their growth hormone. And it also is not capable of germinating and that will give you a plant that needs the growth hormone to be able to germinate and also to be able to set seeds. Chris Smith: So in other words, you would supplement plants which you had sown on a mine field with this growth factor which would keep them alive until such time as you stopped supplying the growth factor and then they would die and there's no chance without those growth factors that they could grow. Carsten Meier: No. Chris Smith: When will you be testing this, because presumably you've done laboratory tests, but have you tried it out in real live mine fields to see whether it genuinely can pick up mines? Carsten Meier: No, that's our next step. I think that one of the first places would either be Sri Lanka, Bosnia, it could also be Afghanistan. Chris Smith: At the moment, how are mine fields cleared? Carsten Meier: At present you have several methods. The most reliable is actually prodding the soil, which means that you use an object which could be a bayonet from a rifle and you poke it into the soil at an angle of 45 degrees and you do that for every one to two centimetres. One of the main problems with that technique is that if the people who put down the mine has turned it 90 degrees you will hit the trigger when you poke your blade into the soil, and so it's very time consuming. The second and I think the best method at present is the use of dogs. Dogs sense the same compounds that leak out of the land mines as the plant does and they can be trained to sense the presence of the land mine. When I went to Africa the first time before we started the project and actually spoke with some mine detecting people, they told me that they believed the system would be good with plants because when they take dogs to the mine field, when they cut the vegetation freshly and release the dogs they are much more efficient to pick up the scent of where land mines are buried. The drawback of that system is that a mine dog is very expensive, it takes the full time of one individual to train a dog and he needs two years to do it, and in British pounds I think it's around 30,000 pounds to train a dog. Chris Smith: Will your system actually increase the cost effectiveness of mine clearance? Carsten Meier: I think that it's not really the issue. The issue is that the method would be used to free land, which can be used for growth of agricultural products. Our system doesn't remove mines but it indicates where you have to put your resources to get the highest benefit. A good mine person can do 2 to 4 square metres a day. It doesn't make a lot of farmlands available if you have that kind of work rate. Chris Smith: Will these plants grow on all different types of soil? Carsten Meier: Well , Arabidopsis thaliana is basically a plant geneticist's fruit fly and one of the reason that it's chosen is because it grows naturally all over the world in different varieties, some in very harsh dry climates, others in very cold climates. But there are of course limitations to where you can grow a plant. High salinity soil is one of the problems, high temperatures, very, very dry sandy soil can also be a problem, but basically we're aiming to use this system in places where you already want to use the land as farm land. Chris Smith: The scientists at Aresa are now also working on using their colour changing cress to act as sentinels which are capable of looking for other environmental dangers including toxic substances in the soil. In the meantime, if you do see a funny looking red plant, don't tread on it. Robyn Williams: Chris Smith and I won't. New technologies everywhere. But now let's turn to old ones. Everyone's been playing a game recently trying to name obsolete technologies - contraptions which should have faded but didn't. The Buzz, the technology program on Radio National had a go recently and paper won. A list is in the magazine The Bulletin this week and so we shall have a go as well. Here's engineer Bill Hammack. Bill Hammack: It seems like we live in a time where things become obsolete quickly, but for every eight-track tape that has gone by the way side, there are age-old technologies that keep on giving. Today I celebrate the geriatric set of technology. You'd think the typewriter would be dead in this computer age. Yet in 2002, Americans bought nearly a half million electronic typewriters. Even manual machines hold their own, two companies - Olympia and Olivetti - still make them. Typewriters survive because of forms: The computer word processor may be a dandy tool, but a printed form sends it scampering to the corner, while undaunted a typewriter conquers the form. Next, consider vacuum tubes. Any one over fifty can recall when slim, slick microchips replaced clunky, slow vacuum tubes. Surely in this age of miniaturization, where cell phones get smaller by the second, we can write the obituary for the vacuum tube. Yet, hundreds of millions of homes around the world all have one: The microwave oven sitting on the counter is essentially one big vacuum tube. Turns out that when you need power you cannot use a weaselly tiny silicon chip, you need the umph from a big old vacuum tube. And beyond that, music lovers have sustained vacuum tube technology. Many find the sound from old-fashioned vacuum tube amplifiers more pleasing to the ear. Here's a third thing you'd expect to be disappearing: Pagers. Cell phones have become so sophisticated and so small that who needs a pager today? Yet in 2002 the old-fashioned pager surprised everyone by selling in greater numbers than the year before. Most people find a pager more reliable than a cell phone. They need far fewer transmitters than cell phones, so they provide better coverage, working in the dead spots between mobile phone cells. And pagers tend not to jam up in emergencies the way overloaded mobile phone cells do. So, many institutions still rely heavily on them: police departments, hospitals, and emergency workers. And my favourite technology, whose death has been predicted again and again: Radio. In the 1940s many expected television to deal it a death blow. But it simply reinvented itself. Radio became the mobile medium. Cars combined with suburbs, superhighways, and longer commutes gave radio a vast captive audience. And radio also stayed local: TV covered the world, but radio gave you the weather above your head. Perhaps the age of broadcast radio is nearly over: There are now mobile MP3 players that download from the web, and satellites that deliver radio. But be wary: You'd not be the first in the last sixty years to write a premature obituary for radio. Copyright 2004 William S.
