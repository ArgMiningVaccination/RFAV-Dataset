Table of Contents --------------Blog Contact Form------------- Biomedical waste in Ayurvedic Hospitals and Management practices Biomedical wastes are the wastes which generates during the treatment of living habitats, diagnosis or related research activities conducted by Institutes or waste generates in health camps. The waste generated for the treatment of sick persons at Ayurvedic Hospitals has a potential health Hazard to the Ecosystem and public surrounding the area. There are several Biomedical wastes generated during the Ayurveda treatment such as Tissues, body parts, discarded blood, gloves, syringes, catheters, other medical supplies oils, plant decoction waste, buttermilk, leaf extract, fresh leaves, burnt ashes, bhasma, arsenic, mercury, etc. The biomedical waste generated through this process is mostly biodegradable and can be managed through deep burial methods. For a healthy Environment, the proper management of biomedical waste and disposal facilities becomes important. The management of waste is carried out through various processes such as the Generation of waste, handling, and accumulation of waste, storage facilities, transportation, treatment, and disposal. Adoption of Medical Waste safe handling methods is very important looking at the environmental and health hazard through this activity. Unregulated waste treatment poses a serious threat to human beings and natural habitats as the presence of Carbon dioxide (CO2) Methane, and greenhouse gas (GHG), the presence of which causes global warming and climate change. The management process of the waste generated in ayurvedic treatment are: - Incineration: Residues, bye products; - Landfill: Biomedical Waste ashes after incineration; - Proper Drainage: of the Liquid wastes; - Reuse of Oils through fomentation technique to the same person (mostly these products are non-reusable as these products are contaminated).
