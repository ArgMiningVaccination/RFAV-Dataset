No, The late President WILLI Ail HcKINLEY. Who Killed Our President? The late President's Unhygienic Habits, and the Doctors' Methods at Fault. More Serious Cases Which Recovered Under Seem\u00ad ingly Less Favorable Conditions. By A. T. Buswell, M. D. by to The questionable treatment of our late President the doctors is proving to be of more vital interest human welfare, than the crime of the shooting. Greater mystery seems to gather about the treatment, the more the doctors try to explain the facts involved; bacteriological cultures, alleged poisoned bullets and technical terminology cannot satisfy the public mind. The assassination was prompted by social and political evils in our body politic, which require not merely the execution of the assassin to remedy, but political reform as well. Modern medicine is, likewise, fostered by similar evils peculiar to our civilization and needs a thorough reformation. The professional treatment and death of the presi\u00ad dent is veiled in a secret policy permitted to the medi\u00ad cal fraternity, in which they are shielded by state medical laws of their own invention; and the entire truth regarding the case need never be made public if the doctors prefer to withold the facts, as they have done up to the present time. Under the circumstances, how is it possible to know whether the bullet or the doctors are charge\u00ad able with the death. How be it, in this connection we can only review the strictly medical aspect of the case. If the lamentable tragedy will serve to awaken the people of this fair land to the far greater crimes that are daily practiced by the medical profession, owing, partly to the superstitious faith of the people in drugs and unscientific medical methods and partly to the ignorance and selfishness of doctors them\u00ad selves, the President will have died in a noble cause. Let us briefly review the manoeuvres of the phy\u00ad sicians at the bedside of the deceased. The autopsy, conflicting with the history of the case, reveals either the entire ignorance of the 15 distinguished medical gentlemen relative to the diagnosis and prognosis of the case, or their optimistic reports were inspired by a sinister motive unworthy the respect of mankind. As to the distinctively surgical operation: from the facts thus far ascertained, we must doubt its ad\u00ad visability at all. The evidence is also to the effect .that it was incomplete or imperfectly performed, but two orifices were sutured, the third being ignored. The antiseptic treatment, also, failed completely, and, the assumption of a poisoned bullet, as a possible cause of death, has been declared unfounded. Again, the failure of the autopsy to discover the bullet at all is an unfortunate and evidently inexcusable fact. When we remember that the medical men con\u00ad cerned were selected from the cream of the pro\u00ad fession, that they are the educators of young college men, coming forward to repeat, practically, the same mistakes over and over again in thousands of cases, which, because of their comparative insignificance will never be heard of, we are not surprised at the public demand for explanation and reformation. If medicine were a science there could be no mis\u00ad takes made in its administration; being largely guess work and experimentation on the part of the doctor, sustained by the superstition and entire the art on the part of the patient the gij has become largely empiricism backed ialism. Whyjpn this 20th Century of perl* 10tlft! THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MONTHLY. profession, as old as the human race, make excuses for its mistakes or appeals* for public leniency in its behalf. According to recent reports two pleas are being put forth with the hope of shielding the doctors implicated; one being that they knew the actual con\u00ad dition of the President and misrepresented it to the public at large upon orders from members of the Cabinet, who wished to conceal it for reasons which have not been given. No less authority than Dr. Pozzi, said to be \"the most brilliant surgeon in France/' asserts, \"for State and financial reasons the doctors deliberately fooled the public.\" This being so the 'rottenness in politics, which used the doctors as a cats paw, is on a par with medi\u00ad cine, and gives to Anarchy a justifyable excuse for existence, while Czolgosz should be treated, at least, as fairly before the bar of justice as are the medical PARTICIPANTES CRIMINIS. A more lamentable condition than that of the President's death is the fact that the great army of physicians and surgeons, who should be born and bread with humanitarian principles and impulses are wrongly educated, and unjustly draw their living from the unfortunate invalid world only when and so long as sickness and calamity prevail. The doctor should prevent disease, he should be a teacher of health! It would be easy to criticise in detail the treat\u00ad ment of Mr. McKinley from the first. Compare his case for instance with that famous in the annals of surgery\u2014Alexis St. Martin. He was a hardy young French-Canadian in the employ of the Canada Fur Company,^ On June 6, 1822, he was accidentally shot in the stomach while out hunting with a party of friends. It was between two and three hours before they were able to get a surgeon\u2014Dr. William Beau\u00ad mont, of the United States Army, stationed at a post at Michillimacinac, Mich. For thirty years from that day Dr. Beaumont scarcely lost sight of his patient. The record has made him and St. Martin famous and has proved of price\u00ad less value to science. Dr. Beaumont found that St. Martin had received a charge of powder and buck shot in the left side. He was standing three feet from the muzzle of the gun, and the shot entered at the back wall of the stomach and ranged forward, making a great hole in the front of the stomach.g Above that a hole \"as big as a man's fist,\" says Dr. Beaumont, had been ploughed out in the chest wall. At this time anaesthetics were un\u00ad known. There was no way in which the pain of such wounds could be eased. Antiseptics and antiseptic methods of surgery had never been heard of. A surgeon was not particular to cleanse his hands with great care, much less to boil his rude instruments in water or burn them in an alcohol flame. Dr. Beaumont set to work with all the grit of a United States surgeon trained on the frontier. A portion of the lung, \"abouMhe size of a turkey egg,\" pushed trough the jagged chest wound. Dr. Beau\u00ad mont attempted to push this back, but was prevented by the sharp end of the rib. bone, which had been broken off. He naively states that he \"clipped off\" a bit of the rib and finally got the lung back in \"Its cavity. He then turned his attention to the wound in the abdomen, which he washed with water, and in an hour or so he had his patient tolerably shipshape. Then followed a course of treatment which to this day, seventy-nine years later, is the wonder of science. That any human being survived it seems in\u00ad credible. \"I applied a carbonated fermenting poultice/' says the doctor, \"and kept the surrounding parts wet with a lotion of muriate of ammonia and vinegar.\" St. Martin fell into a raging fever and the doctor was spurred to extraordinary efforts to save his life. Seeing that the patient breathed with difficulty, the doctor says: \"I bled him copiously eighteen or twenty times and gave him a cathartic.\" The cathartic, writes the doctor, merely escaped through the wound and did no good. The bleeding he considered as very helpful, so did the doctors who bled to death President Washington. From that time Dr. Beaumont's account shows that he kept on ad\u00ad ministering cathartics and camphor. All attempts to close up the wound entirely failed. The chest wall closed and the lung got well. The hole in the stomach remained, although St. Martin lived, otherwise well and robust, for forty years. Dr. Beaumont conceived the idea of watching the various digestive processes through the aperture in his patient's stomach. He employed St. Martin to work for him, chop\u00ad ping wood, caring for horses and doing all sorts of hard work. A sort of flap grew from the inside wall of the stomach and formed a screen which served to retain the food but which could easily be pushed aside. Dr. Beaumont made an exhaustive study of the time which was required for the digestion of almost every known food.,He reached in through the stomach window, extracted the various digestive fluids and analyzed them. He discovered all the strange pro\u00ad cesses of digestion and noted them down for the first time. St. Martin throughout his life was unusually healthy. He had an attack of cholera and recovered easily. He returned to his old trade of hunting for a few years, married a Canadian woman and raised a large family, always working hard to keep them in good circumstances. After the case of St. Martin recoveries from.gun\u00ad shot wounds of the abdomen were as rare as ever until modern surgery took hold of them. In 1836 Dr. Baudens, a French surgeon, per\u00ad formed two operations in attempts to save his patients. One patient died and one recovered. In 1884 Dr. William T. Bull, of New York, per\u00ad formed the famous operation of laparotomy upon a patient whose intestines were perforated seven times by one bullet. Since then equally difficult cases have been man\u00ad aged successfully. Dr. Bull's patient was William McEIroy, a truck driver, twenty-two years old. He was shot by a 32- calibre revolver, the ball entering just above the centre of the stomach. He was carried to the Chambers Street Hospital and Dr. Bull was summoned. The operating\" room was sprayed for two hours with antiseptic fluids before the patient was laid on the table, and the operation was performed at night. It lasted two hours, and once during that time the % truckman ceased entirely to breathe. As the intestines were pulled out and passed through the surgeon's fingers they were kept warm by being wrapped in towels wrung in hot water. In four feet of the intestines several holes were found and sutured. Just twenty-lour days horn that time he ate a Thanksgiving dinner of turkey and plum-pudding. Dr. Park, one of the President's surgeons, suc\u00ad cessfully treated one of the most remarkable of the modern cases of gunshot wounds in the abdomen. An Italian laborer, twenty-five years old, was shot two inches to the left of the centre of the stomach with a 32-calibre revolver. Dr. Park opened the abdomen, found the bullet and sewed up four per\u00ad forations in the intestines, in forty-three minutes. The wounds were dusted inside and out with iodo\u00ad form. The man got well in twenty-one days. Private Jamieson, an English soldier in the Boer war, while helping to test a rifle, was shot in the ab\u00ad domen. The rifle was loaded with a blank cartridge covered with cardboard wadding and a wax plug. The shooting occurred just after Private Jamieson had eaten a hearty breakfast, and the rifle was only six inches from his stomach when he got the charge. No operation was performed. The soldier vomited the powder, cardboard wad and wax plug-. The cartridge did not appear. Private Jamieson recovered in nine weeks. Many physicians, especially of the old school, still refuse to operate in cases of abdominal wounds by gunshot. Dr. H. L. Goetz and Dr. Edward Horni- brook both cite instances of recovery where the stomach was not opened. I desire to call attention particularly to the fact that President McKinley was in no condition to stand the shock to his system of the assault, say nothing of I the treatment. His pervers methods of living, partic\u00ad ularly his excessive tobacco habit, had brought his blood to a condition which favored blood poisoning upon the least occasion, and it is not strange that his injury proved fatal even with the superior methods employed to those of St. Martin. The difference in the ages of the two men should count for naught. There is no reason why blood should not be as pure and the vital power as vigorous in a man of 60 as in a man of 30 if he is living rightly, as proven by the late Premier Gladstone. If a thorough-bred dog had been shot, as was our President, he would have crawled into a shady nook, refused all food, occasionally lapping a little water, until his instinct told him the wound had healed. Why can't our medical men learn from Mother Nature? Her ways are too simple, they say, and so they en\u00ad force feeding, resort to drugs and thus thwart Nature's beneficient ways. There are, especially, two costly lessons to be drawn from McKinley's case. First: From the evidence given by Dr. Wasdin, when the incision was reopened on tbe fifth day, \"No effort was required to THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MONTHLY. open it through its entire length mtmongn omy mm track of the bullet was affected/* This fact clearly indicates that Nature had not done her beneficent work as is usual in healthy cases. The President was but 58 years of age, and should have been in the best condition; but his com\u00ad plexion and general appearence had lor some years indicated that his health was being gradually under- mined by faulty habits. It is passing strange that the clergy, with hardly an exeption, have passed their eulogies on the life and character of the late Presi\u00ad dent without drawing a helpful lesson as a warning to our young men regarding the little indulgences, like that of smoking, which grew upon the otherwise great man and which finally bound him in their relentless grasp and broke down his health, leaving his system unable to healthfully react from the shock. And this was going on, remember, while he was, for years, under the daily care of chosen physicians. A second lesson may be drawn from the fact that while employing its leading representatives, the medical system has proven itself to be erring in its diagnosis, faulty in its treatment and untruthful in its prognosis, finally falling into a disgraceful monger over the dead body. .

THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MONTHLY About the Preparation of Non-alcoholic Wines. I have been repeatedly asked about the prepara\u00ad tion of non-alcoholic wines, and to satisfy the various queries, I have decided to publish the following: Fruits of all sort (either grapes, apples, etc.) arc first of all pressed in the usual way as when making ordinary cider, and then this juice is placed in a clean barrel to settle overnight. Now this clear fluid is filled into strong bottles (preferably mineral-wat^r bottles) by means of a faucet;\u2014however, care should be taken not to com\u00ad pletely fill the bottles, there should remain a space of about % to i inch. The bottles are now closed by means of an ordin\u00ad ary corking-machine (I use one with a lever-pressure), with cylindrical not too pointed corks of a medium quality, after having previously sterilized these corks by immersing them for some time in hot water\u2014by which process they will also have become somewhat softer. After having put a cork into each bottle they should also be fastened in addition either with a strong cord or piece of wire. That concludes the prelimin\u00ad aries for the sterilizing of the fermenting germs bv boiling. ep ed Whoever wishes still to improve upon this desires to manufacture cider or wine which will for years, should, after several months had eta since the first, sterilizing process, again refill the tents of the previously filled bottles into other : ones, sterilize these again the same way as doii< first time, and should then after the bottles have been cooled off again, cut off the corjks flat over the neck of the bottles, and dip these cut-off spaces into molten paraffin, whereby the contents of the bottles are closed hermetically, and may be kept for years id a suitable place without any fermentation ensuing. The above is the complete explanation how to manufacture non-alcoholic wines, which to invalids and children as well as to healthy people are so very welcome and beneficient. I myself generally drink very little only, i. have only a very moderate craving after any kind fluid, but I certainly prefer this kind of non-alcoholic beverage to any other (with the exception of pure, fresh drinking water). Therefore I advise you now, to try it yourself, and see how you may like it, for the proof of the good\u00ad ness of any pudding is in the eating. To Our Readers. For this purpose I use a pretty large washing- boiler, into which can be placed a large wicker basket which should be able to hold 15 to 20 bottles. A number of bottles is now placed therein along\u00ad side and upon each other, and the boiler is filled with fresh water until all the bottles are covered. There\u00ad upon a small fire is lit and the water gradually heated to 1300 to 1360 F., and if the water in the boiler has attained this temperature, the bottles inside the bas\u00ad ket should, if possible, be allowed to remain in that bath at about the same temperature for half an hour. However,, great care is advisable, as, if for instance the water gets much hotter than 1360 F. the bottles will burst one after the other, or the corks may be forced out if not properly fastened before, etc. With proper care, however, nothing of the sort should happen. After the half hour has elapsed the basket with all the bottles is lifted all at once from the boiler. Upon the extracted bottles which should be placed alongside each other, a clean piece of cloth is spread, which shoull previously have been dipped into hot water and been wrung out again,\u2014to prevent hereby any access of fungous germs during the absorption of fresh air. Now the boiler may be filled afresh, but of course no cold bottles should be placed right away into the hot water, because they might burst. As the reader will see by above directions, the en\u00ad tire process demands great care and precision; how\u00ad ever, after some little practice, a single person ma)' thus finish quite a number of bottles in a single day. After they have been treated in this way, the bot\u00ad tles are placed in a dry store-room, or cellar, and are laid down in layers over each other in a large case, until the contents of the bottles have become clear again.; I have on hand quite a quantity of bottles treated in this way during last year; the juice is quite clear and as sweet as if freshly pressed. For the last few months we have occasionally been favored by some of our readers and patrons with names and addresses of friends, who they thought likely to feel inter\u00ad ested in our Magazines.

The Voices of Nature. (Concluded from September issue.) The more man sets his face again towards nature, the more his conscience and instinct will re-awaken within him, and the more acute will his organs of sense become. He is still surrounded by many happy crea\u00ad tures : children and especially animals, who have pre\u00ad served these higher guides of life and from whom he can learn the true course in all emergencies. If man, therefore, has gained sufficient power of resistance to the seductions of science, he may easily be led by the hand of nature, and will then surely sdon recover health and true happiness. He will no longer be tossed about upon the ocean of life, like a ship without a rudder, destined to be dashed to pieces against rocks and reefs. M THE:; JUNGBORN. When, after a long, long search I came from error to truth, from night to light, from disease to health, I was seized by a great desire to impart my experiences to my fellowmen and to let them profit by them. I determined to place the strength and vigor which I had but just regained, entirely at the disposal of the great cause. I resolved to. become the champion of nature, to work for her, and*to point out the right way which will lead men from dreaded night to joyous light; to true health and complets happiness\u2014those purblind and deluded men who no longer understand nature and who abuse her marvelous goodness to their own destruction. The mere thought of devoting my life entirely to nature and her great truths was indeed, blessedness. I soon began to write this book. But I also founded the place called \"Jungborn,\" in the Hartz, between Isenburg and Hartzburg. This is, first of all, a model institution for the true natural life, where those who wish to make arrangements for such a life at home in their own gardens can find the pattern. It was also meant to show, from the start,, how the most intimate communion wih nature can be re-established, and at the same time to demonstrate in practice how easy and what a blessing such com\u00ad munion is. In the meantime the Jungborn has fulfilled its purpose completely. After its pattern many have al\u00ad ready made the requisite arrangements in their own homes or gardens. Other similar institutions are coming into life. The Jungborn has now also practically demon\u00ad strated the correctness of the return to nature meth\u00ad ods, and its significance for the welfare and salvation of man. For the rest it has always been my aim to show how we can lead a natural life at home, under ordinary circumstances, and establish a relationship with na ture,for in this way alone can my book be of service to the masses. It was necessary to mention the Jungborn here, as I shall have occasion to refer to it. A detailed description of the Jungborn and its arrangements will be found at the end of this volume. THE NATURAL J BATH. Within the last century great and gifted men have taken up the nature cure method, & Their genius led them to the ways of nature. Priessnitz, Schroth, Gra\u00ad ham, Rausse, Rikli, Kneipp, Kuhne, Densmore, Trail and others have already achieved great things, and have won for themselves immortal honor, for from darkness they penetrated into light. But these men have by no means been fully and clearly conscious that they must allow instinct alone to lead them, and they have not strictly and carefully followed the other voices of nature, which I have often mentioned. They have not sufficiently studied the ways of children and animals, those beings who still possess the true guides of life in a higher degree than the adults of modern civilization. S They have con\u00ad sidered with sufficient care many of the contrivances and intentions of nature. Therefore their systems and teachings have not been perfect, they have contained mistakes and errors. These systems have now partb been forgotten, and in the course of time will be entirely swallowed up in the seat of oblivion: After mankind has deviated from nature for thou\u00ad sands and thousands of years, it is very evident that they can only gradually regain a true insight as to which are their duties toward nature and her laws. All the men who have hitherto built up the nature cure methods are deserving of our highest praise* THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MUJNIH^. We must by no means heap reproaches upon them and accuse them, because their systems are faulty and because they did not yet reach a complete natural method. The nature cure method has evidently inspired the most serious and largest movement that civilized mankind has yet seen. It concerns itself with the health of the individual, that greateri of worldly pos\u00ad sessions upon which such an infinite amount of well- being and happiness depends, and which is the only possible safety and redemption from all misery and \"evils\u2014from final ruin. Therefore we may not remain silent or conceal anything concerning any person, but must above all things keep our eye upon the great cause, and subjugate everything, every other interest and every person to this cause. From this point of view I shall not hesitate to uncover the mistakes of former nature cure methods, of the old vegetarianism, etc.But in doing so I do not wish to hurt any one. I shall now advance a mode of life and a curative system which has nothing whatever to do with sci\u00ad ence, and in which we allow ourselves to be guided, as I have frequently stated before, by the great teacher \"nature/' alone. Thus at last a beautiful, bright . morning sun will rise from dark chaos, which man\u00ad kind will greet with joy. We now have a simple nature-cure system, as simple as the great teacher, nature, herself. This na\u00ad ture-cure system is the same for all diseases, and all cases, even as the origin of all diseases has but one cause, an unnatural mode of life, and there exists a unity in all the laws of nature and in all her manifesta\u00ad tions. ^ All the former nature-cure methods will grad\u00ad ually dissolve in this one true nature system. In this method there is nothing to be learned in the usual sense of the word, every one who has but freed himself from the spell of modern wisdom and science can apply it. Through it men become free from all dependency and slavery to the entire frater\u00ad nity of physicians, doctors of medicine as well as nature doctors. Nature does not err, therefore in her the errors and contradictions which are now keeping so many away from the nature-cure methods, do not exist. The invalid'who allows himself to be guided en\u00ad tirely by the hand of nature is led gently, without se verity and distressing deprivations, much more gently, and more pleasantly, quickly, and more surely than b} the former nature-cure methods, back to health, strength, and vital energy unto a fresh, green meadov full of flowers and sunshine. And above all, the se\u00ad verest and most desperate diseases, in the presence of which the ordinary nature doctor is helpless, loosen their grip and drop off before Nature. The true nature-cure system penetrates with its healing power into the innermost recesses of the mind and soul. Dark veils are lifted from the mind; even the soul participates in the healing balm.if*Man is released from vice and crime, hatred, envy, and ma\u00ad levolence. Peace, joy, brotherly love, happiness once more take up their abode in the breasts of the un\u00ad happy human beings of to-day. Now at last the morning of a new &ptx\u00bbyg for humanity; paradise is regained. As I have said before, 1 once fled from tht err a? and confusion, the strife and dissensions of man to nature. Here alcne I found rest, peace, and tratJt. When in the present century mankind instinc\u00ad tively turned their faces once more toward nature, it became evident to them that all diseases had their ori\u00ad gin in impure matter in the blood, in the body,\u2014in disease or foreign matter. On the basis of ihlg cor\u00ad rect discernment people, in treating the sick, soon re\u00ad frained from exercising the devil with Beelzebub by introducing more foreign matter and poison into the body, as medical science does by drugs, medicines*, etc. They sought rather to cleanse the sick body of its. foreign matter, and that, indeed, with but one natural remedy, with water. In this respect the peasant Vincent Priessnitz was the pioneer. He is therefore to be considered as the real founder of the present nature-cure method. The nature-cure method was in the beginning only a water-cure method, and only water-cure insti\u00ad tutions were at first established. Therefore it was my first endeavor to obtain from nature herself directions for the right use of water applications. In my endeavors I did not observe that an inner voice directed me to a special use of water\u2014namely the instinct. But I learned from foresters that the animals of free nature which follow only their instinct, take a bath according to definitee rules. I began to observe them and reached the fol\u00ad lowing conclusions: The natural bath does not consist in jumping into the river and taking a full bath. THE FULL, BATH TAKEN IN THE RIVER OR IN THE BATH TUB IS CONTRARY TO NATURE. Land animals not only take no full baths, they are actually afraid of them. | One need only to throw an animal (especially a monkey) into the water and see how eagerly it makes for the shore. To other water applications also animals submit only under compul\u00ad sion and most unwillingly.* On the other hand, the higher land animals (mammalia), especially wild boars and deer, in free nature (in the forest), are in the habit of lying down in small muddy swamps or pools, at first only with the abdomen, and rubbing it to and fro in the mud. Hereupon the animals rise and generally sit for awhile with their posterior, their anus, in the mud. After awhile they roll in the mud for a moment with their whole body, and then rub themselves against the earth, trees, and other objects. Hunters call this bathing of the animals \"wallowing/' The birds, on the other hand, go to brooks or springs, and by immersing their necks throw water over their bodies by means of the hollow that is formed between the neck and the trunk, and by splash\u00ad ing themselves with their wings. Then they rub or * Individual exceptions which mestic animals that already lead tmr nothing* to the contrary. KX\u00abr AR an 4CK 266 THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MONTHLY scrub their body with their head and bill and their wing-elbows, if I may so call the wing joint which corresponds to the human elbow. It has always been vainly asked why it is, for in\u00ad stance, that the stag, the king of our'forests, this beau\u00ad tiful, otherwise so cleanly animal, that carefully avoids soiling his lair, and in many other respects shows himself most cleanly, can lie down in such muddy water to bathe, while birds will bathe only in clear water. I am of the opinion that mammals bathe in the mud only because they can thus rub and scrub the abdomen and the sexual organs, which they could not do in clear running water with a hard bottom. Birds, on the other hand, because they are built differently and can rub themselves with several limbs, do not require the mud for the purpose of rubbing and scrubbing. The explanation that the mud is required because it enables the mammals to rub themselves, is consid\u00ad ered a most plausible one by all foresters, too. We see, then, that the more highly developed ani\u00ad mals bathe. The roe, the chamois, etc., do not bathe, probably because these species have been placed by nature upon high mountainous and rocky regions where water is not always to be had. Neither do beasts of prey bathe, It is likewise quite evident why they do not bathe.* The bath has a quieting influence, but beasts of prey cannot allow themselves to be puieted, they must be bloodthirsty and wild, their place in nature requires it, otherwise they would lack the incentive and the ca\u00ad pacity to win their prey. It is the meat diet that de\u00ad velops these bloodthirsty cravings.** There is no reason, however, why man, the high\u00ad est creature, should not bathe. It must rather be as\u00ad sumed that nature prescribes a bath for the preserva\u00ad tion and strengthening of his highest physical and spiritual powers. Men have, indeed, always had an instinctive long\u00ad ing for baths, and even if the inner voice no longer plainly indicates the right kind of bath, every one still feels a need to cool the abdomen, the anus, and the sexueal organs by means of water. Thus we see that animals bathe in different ways according to the construction of their bodies. Mam\u00ad mals take their baths in a different way than birds. Now whoever has carefully watched animals at their bath and has observed the pains they take to rub * It cannot be called a bath if our domestic dog goes into the water on a very warm day, ** It is easy to see how beasts become blood\u00ad thirsty through a meat diet. The hunter's setter only brings the game to bay, tut does not attack it so long as he is fed on vegetable food alone, but as soon as he is given meat he begins to bite and kill. I knew an ape in the zoological garden that was very gentle and good-natured. But when he was fed on meat, he became vicious and snapped even at his keeper for whom he had had the most friendly feelings. Beasts of prey must, indeed, be savage and blood\u00ad thirsty, in order to win their prey.* or cool the sexual organs in the mud (or water), easily takes the hint of nature and comes to see what the natural bath for man ought to be, especially when he attempts to take a bath in the open air where no arti\u00ad ficial apparatus or other aids are to be found. I shall now proceed to describe the natural bath. Since most people must, for the present, take their bath in a room, and have not always an opportunity to bathe in the open air, they must naturally have a basin or tub. It may be any sort of basin or tub in which a person can comfortably sit with his knees drawn up. The following cuts show tubs that can now be procured in the market. The bather sits down in the tub which contain?, naturally cold water, about three and a half inches (8 cm.) deep, so that the seat, the feet, and the sexual organs are for the most part in the water. Only the seat and the feet touch the bottom of the tub, while the knees are quite aways above the water. The knees are now spread apart, and the water is vigorously dashed over the abdomen with the hollow of the hand. The throwing of the water is followed by a brisk rubbing of the abdomen in the middle, on both sides, and all over with one or both hands. After this alternating process has been carried on awhile, the woman rubs the region of the groins and the external part of the sexual organs with the open hand under water (the sexual organs are supposed to be sub\u00ad merged). The man also rubs the region of the groins, the testicles, and the dam (the region between the sexual organs and the anus) with the open hand, und?r water. Hereupon the entire body is rapidly washed with the bare hands. | A second person can assist in rapidly washing the body. Then the body is rubbed with the bare open hands (not with a towel or flesh- brush) until it is completely dry. The body ought never to be dried with a towel after a bath. The rubbing with the hands can be done by the bather himself. This is at the same time a beneficial bodily exercise. But the rubbing can also be done profitably by a second person. I shall return to this further on.* (Will be continued.) * The bath of the sexual organs, after the manner indicated, is very important, especially for woman f || is especially effective and healing in cases of sexu.tl excitement and irritation. Bath tubs No. i and 2 are made of zinc, No. 3 is made of wood, and is therefore more appropriate and desirable. The bath in the wooden tub is the mo~,t beneficial. For the open air, bath tubs of stone or cement are the most appropriate. They must not be too narrow.

CO o 00 A CONSULTATION HOUR WITH THE VERY REV. MGR. SEB. KNpjPf. THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MONTHLY. Osteopathy and its Relation to Nature. By Dr. Geo. Boiler, Osteopathic Physician, New York. What is Osteopathy? Osteopathy is derived from the two Greek words, \"\"Osteon\" meaning bone, and \"Pathos\" meaning suf\u00ad fering, and is now the name of the new scientific method or system of treating diseased conditions of the human body, without medicine or the knife. Osteopathy is nothing more or less than an ad\u00ad justment of the human body. It aims to correct mis\u00ad placements of a bone, ligament or muscle, the ob\u00ad struction of a blood'vessel, nerve inactivity, fluid con\u00ad gestion or the collection of diseased germ-laden fluids in the system. In the removal of these obstructions, irritations and hindrances to free activity lies the osteo\u00ad pathic work, the secret of health restoration. The name Osteopathy was given to the new sci\u00ad ence on account of the fact, that the displacement of bone occupied the first place jn the category of causes or lesions producing diseased conditions. Osteopathy was discovered by Andrew Taylor Still, M. D., in 1874. His reasoning was, \"that a natural flow of blood is health; that disease is the effect of local or general disturbance of the blood; that to excite the nerves causes muscles to contract and to compress venous flow of blood to the heart; and that the bones could be used as levers to relieve pressure on nerves, veins, and arteries.\" Dr. Still conceived the idea that the human system is a machine, perfectly framed by its Maker, and, if kept in a con\u00ad dition of proper adjustment, it is capable of surviving for a long time. He found that lviampiuauons cotwa be made, almost at will, in connect ion with the skeletal structure, with the result that all the organs could pp stimulated to perform their normal functions. Otft of this beginning there has developed a system, able to restore all the abnormal structural and functional dis\u00ad order of the human body. Osteopathy is based on accurate knowledge of die anatomical structure and physiological functions of the human body or organism. Nature has placed within the body certain vital forces, vitalized fluids, and vital\u00ad izing processes and activities, which in harmony with one another maintain the equilibrium of the body- mechanism ; any disturbance of these forces, fluids or processes, and any interference with their activitv, circulation or distribution involve the absence of har\u00ad mony and interference of body order. In the removal of these disturbances and hindrances to free activity lies the great secret of Osteopathy. Scientific ma\u00ad nipulations are designed to restore these to their nor\u00ad mal condition, so that the body may regain its normal functional equilibrium and form. In this way life is revitalized and strengthened by vital forces, vitalizing fluids and processes, disease being removed or over\u00ad borne by getting rid of functional disorder that pro\u00ad duces disharmony in the body and prevents normal activity of body functions. Osteopathy makes no demands upon the vitality of the patient, but enlists all the curative powers con\u00ad tained within the body, which readily respond when properly appealed to. Its method is purely mechani\u00ad cal and its therapeutic principles might be classified as follows: a.) Scientific manipulations, that correct dis\u00ad placements in the bony or tissue structure of the bod}', in its membranes or organs; b.) Scientific manipulations, that are designed to rectify the disturbances in the circulation of the body fluids and to restore them to their normal condition, especially blood conditions and defects in the blood circulation and distribution; and c.) Scientific manipulations that utilize the ner\u00ad vous system with its fibres, ganglia and centres, with the view of correcting nervous disorders, toning up the general system, or its local parts, promoting trophic conditions of the nerves and muscles, and stimulating a normal correlation of the psychic with the physio\u00ad logical and vegetative functions of the human body. Osteopathic diagnosis is entirely a new science and involves the idea of a refined and sensitive taction. It is based upon the theory of discovering the cause or causes of disease. Osteopathic symptomatology summarizes diag\u00ad nostic conditions as follows: 1. Displacement of bone, cartilage, ligament, muscle, tissue, or organs in the body; 2. Disturbances in the fluids of the organism, including the blood, lymph and other secretions of the body; and 3. Disorders or derangements of tension, im\u00ad pingement, thickening, induration, etc., of the nervous system, including its centres, ganglia, plexuses and fibres. A complete anatomical and physiological know* ledge enables the practitioner to property discriminate 270 THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MONTHLY. between normal and abnormal conditions. Osteo\u00ad pathic examination of a patient by far excels any sub\u00ad jective statement of the case, as facts become the sci\u00ad entific basis of true diagnosis. The Osteopathic phy\u00ad sician traces the condition of disturbance to its pri\u00ad mary cause, through or by the aid of symptoms and secondary conditions. Here, Osteopathy has stepped far ahead of any other science or school of healing. The first examination of a patient by an Osteo\u00ad path is with special reference to the normality of the skeleton, for though a luxation may be but partial, it may be causing a pressure at some point upon a nerve or blood vessel, of which the patient is entirely uncon\u00ad scious and which thus remains unaccounted for, as a barrier to health restoration. That luxations are much more common than sup\u00ad posed, and can be produced by an accident so slight, as to go unobserved, is painfully demonstrated by the thousands of cases that have been overlooked by some of the most eminent physicians; when, had they been searched for from the osteopathic standpoint, they could, no doubt, have been easily reduced, thus remov\u00ad ing the cause of many so-called chronic diseases, that often prove so perplexing to the practitioner of the medical science. Osteopathy does not ignore the fact, that there are many indirect causes that may be classified under the head of predisposing causes, distinguished from the direct causes of diseased conditions; from a sanitary and hygienic standpoint, bacilli of multiform variety, infested germs, come into play in producing distur\u00ad bances of functions and causing local or general dis\u00ad order in the tissues of the body. Osteopathy proves, that behind these secondary causes is found the real cause of disease; these conditions simply furnishing the means for the action of a perverted function and therefore involving a derangement of the tissue. Osteopathically, the first fundamental principle of therapeutics is, when diagnosis has discovered such structural or fundamental disorder, to remove the lesion or correct the displacement, whether of bone, cartilage, ligament or muscle. Hereafter, attention is paid to the general health of the patient, by spe\u00ad cific manipulation to the body tissue, so as to promote free circulation of the body fluids, along with atten\u00ad dance to correct hygienic and dietetic rules. % A free flow of blood is the remedial agency in the Osteopathic treatment of inflammatory processes, their termination by resolution being promoted by relaxation of the structures involved, thus freeing the blood-passages through and from the affected area, whereby the capillaries are flushed with a fresh supply of blood, removing rapidly morphological elements as the circulation is being restored. This method is not only effective in simple processes, but especially so in those where micro-orgainism is a peculiar char\u00ad acteristic, such as diphtheria or typhoid fever. Osteo\u00ad pathy has for its purpose in the treatment of all such diseases, simply the restoration of healthy tissue, as no microbe can inhabit tissues physiologically normal, and only such as have imperfect elimination of waste materials are susceptible to their invasion and are suitable for their development. They are, therefore, the result rather than the cause of pathological condi\u00ad tions. The greatest physiologists teach that one of tht most important offices of the white blood corpuscles is to destroy invading micro-organisms. Undoubt\u00ad edly they are a powerful microbicide, a remedial agency in these processes, especially provided by na\u00ad ture, and consequently uninjurious to the system. Osteopathy has discovered that stimulation oi the spleen by vibration will increase the corpuscular richness of the blood, thereby aiding in the destruction of micro-organic germs. Treating diseased conditions by the vasomotor system, it is- possible to keep the circulation of fresh and nutritious blood, so as to check the ravages of the micro-organic germs to such an extent as to promote the destruction of microbes by the action of phago\u00ad cytes, by stimulating the white blood corpuscles to activity in the destruction of the micro-organism, or by the production of chemical compounds that destroy the germs? This renders unnecessary the dangerous injection of serum, on the basis of serum-therapy, including vaccination that inflicts untold suffering and brings death to thousands of ignorant mortals yearly. The Osteopath looks upon the nervous system of the human body as an immense electrical machine, containing its own batteries, wires and other necessary appliances. It is capable of generating all the force needed, and simply requires perfect continuity and co\u00ad ordination by mechanical methods.;: The brain re\u00ad ceives sensory impressions, and transmits motive im\u00ad pulses. The spinal cord conducts them to and from the various wires, which carry the impulses to the most remote-tissues of the entire body. The control of the nervous system over the func\u00ad tions concerned in the motion, sensation and nutrition of the entire body, places it among the leading agen\u00ad cies of Osteopathic therapeutics. In the spinal cord, the most important part of the human body to the Osteopath, there are localized subsidary centers, corresponding with the primary brain centers, so that in nervous disorders or dis\u00ad eases of a nervous origin or complication, the operator can reach those centers of vital activity in connection with the vital forces, by manipulation along the spine. It is, therefore , within the power of a skilful Osteopath to produce effects in almost any part of the body, so that by spinal stimulation, neural harmony, neural trophisity and neural continuity of impulses may be established. The Osteopath, with a thorough knowledge of the many nerve centers and the innervation of the various tissues and organs, is capable to co-ordinate the nerve force of the body, and to increase the nerve-current in almost any part of the being. The practicability of this has been satisfactorily demonstrated in the Osteopathic treatment of ataxia, paralysis, anesthetic and hyperesthetic conditions as well as in regulation of the secretory and peristaltic processes in the intes\u00ad tines, the regulation of the action of the heart, con^ trolling the circulatory system, and all inflammatory and febrile conditions. The old school of medicine made it a study and practice for centuries, to discuss and explore the field of drug-action upon the tissues and organs of the human body, while the Osteopath has been substi-THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MONTHLY. Ifl tutinsr the laboratory of human nature for the medical- drug* laboratory. This human laboratory, the human organism, is the most wonderful that exists anywhere in the universe. It generates acids, alkalies and all necessary fluids and chemical compounds to wash away accumulations of waste and impurity, The most wonderful chemical results are taking place, every mo\u00ad ment of our lives, which form the basis of those nor\u00ad mal changes, that keep the body in a healthy condi\u00ad tion. All bodily disorders are the result of mechanical obstructions to free circulation of vital fluids and forces and harmony of nerve force; they are an inter\u00ad ference with the normal action of the human labora\u00ad tory. If, for example, a quantity of blood is thrown out by means of rupture, the result is a tumorous con\u00ad dition, resulting in the temporary suspension of vital activity. Such deposits are capable of being removed by nature's means, osteopathically. In the body's chemical laboratory-process of compounding, redu\u00ad cing and forming substances of all chemical varieties, lies nature's power to dissolve the most solid sub\u00ad stances, so as to prepare for the upbuilding* process. Osteopathic manipulations, scientifically applied, will throw in the chemical supplies of the human labo\u00ad ratory, where they are most demanded, thus assisting nature in the renovation, by furnishing it with such substances as are needed, so as to remove all hin\u00ad drances to health, and to supply all that is necessary to normal vitality. # # The Osteopath's knowledge of the great natural laws of nerve action, in connection with the human body laboratory, enables him to hold the forces of the body at his finger's ends and to direct them toward the recovery of the natural conditions of health. Osteopathy began by demonstrating its thera\u00ad peutic value in the case of alleged chronic conditions. It has branched out in every direction, until to-day it covers the whole field of medicine. The Osteopathic principle is a time-honored one. \"similia similibus curantur,\" in the sense, that the only rational and scientific method of curing disease is based upon nature^. It uses all the therapeutic principles, from a standpoint of nature, such as the use of proper hygienic and die\u00ad tetic principles, and in fact any principle that is in the line of nature or natural laws of the human body. Osteopathy gained its results, because it uses natural methods and aids nature. All nature is preg\u00ad nant with force, and natural force is the most remedial, because it is natural.

To get best Results from Results from Refrigerators There are many people who from a false idea of econ\u00ad omy fail to get the best results from the use of ice and re\u00ad frigerators. A common mistake is getting a small piece of ice every day or every other day, instead of filling the ice chamber two or three times a week. The small piece of ice cannot reduce the temperature sufficiently, and the result is that each new piece melts raqidly and the food cannot be kept long. It will be found at the end of the season that the cost of ice and waste of food have been much greater than if the ice chamber had been kept filled.\u2014Maria Parloa, in The Ladies' Home Journal. At the banquet of the National Wholesale Druggists' Association, recently given in Chicago, the Rev. Frank Crane addressed the association on the above subject. The following epigrams are culled from his address: \"Man is the only animal that was made to laugh, and as science teaches that laughter is a sure boon to health, it is a sin for us to substitute excessive drug-taking for laughter.** \"Laughter increases the the circulation of the spleen.\" \"I once knew a man who laughed so much that when he died they had to cut his liver out and kill it with a club.\" \"Beware of theologians who have no sense of mirth: they are not altogether human.\" \"Keep your chin up.\" \"Don,t take your troubles to bed with you; hang them* on the chair with your trousers or drop them into a glass of. water with your teeth.\"\u2014Suggestion.

The Priessnitz Hydropathic Establishment, Richmond Hill, Surrey, England. II. The Physiology of Sleep. Animal Magnetism. In a series of lectures given by John Bovee Dods on the Phylosophy of Mesmerism or Animal Mag\u00ad netism (one of the first authorities on this subject) say$: \"If a healthy child of three or four years of age be permitted to sleep every night for a year or two between two old grandparents, it will pine away and if not removed perchance it may die. There is, perhaps, not one within the sound of my voice, but that has heard the remark that, \"it is very unhealthy for young children to sleep with very old infirm people.\" It is even so, and parents should beware. The child is full of animal life, and its nervous system is charged with the vital fluid, secreted by the brain. This gives that suppleness to the limbs and that buoy\u00ad ancy to the heart which we witness in the young. The grand-parents lack the proper quantity of this nervo-vital fluid which occasions that rigidity of limbs we witness in the aged. The same common law of equilibrium that pervades the universe is here also in operation. The nervo-vital fluid passes from this child to the two aged persons in conjunction. The child loses and they continue to revive, and as this little one can never bring these infirm persons up to an equilibrium with itself, so it must go down with them. Nature will have her equilibrium if she has it in death.\" Townsend remarks that King David, the Psalm\u00ad ist, when he became very old got a damsel to sleep with him, that from her vigorous life he might obtain a supply to lengthen out nis days. And he was ac\u00ad quainted with an infirm old lady who was so perfectly aware of the benefit so derived from sleeping with young persons that with a sort of horrid, vampirism she always obliged her maid to share the. same bed with her; thus successively destroying the health of several attendants. This to my mind appears to be the most logical conclusion one can arrive at, but be this as it may, we have sufficient evidence to prove that nervous forces are transferred from one individual to another. It is only a question of susceptibility of one individual to another and the power of giving heat. A child like a young plant which in the course of development is very different to a person of adult age upwards of 50 years of age, or an old plant where the processes of the animal organization are stationery, perhaps declin\u00ad ing in the vital.organs, hence the exudations from the bodies of those who are growing in this way and in the decline of life are very different. I am disposed to think that the young sleeping with the old with a slow and sluggish circulation are undoubtedly benefited by the young, whose condition of body being of a high magnetic character gives off forces with great facility, while that of the old who are precisely the reverse of this condition readily absorb it, and the result is that the young would be robbed of part of their vitality, and the old advantageously benefited. Children who are growing require a good deal of sleep because reparation and structural develop\u00ad ment are much more active during the hours of sleep than when awake; as for instance, babies cannot sleep too much. They require to sleep about 12 to 14 hours. Then again one child would naturally require more sleep than another, hence no definite rule can therefore be given; always taking care to allow the child to sleep when it feels disposed. Sir Benjamin Richardson in his valuable work, \"Disease of Modern Life,\" says: \"In the child, too little sleep induces symptoms of restlessness, peevishness, weariness of play, emaci\u00ad ation, indigestion and great pallor of the face and sur\u00ad face of the body. The enjoyment of the waking hours is curtailed and a dullness which by thoughtless per\u00ad sons is often mistaken for actual stupidity marks every effort at lesson or play. These symptoms are followed by an inability to go to sleep at the natural time, and by the occurrence of an unnatural dreamy sleep when the eyes at length close. The activity of the brain is thus maintaintd in the dream, and another cause of nervous exhaustion is hereby supplied. The man who dreams does but half sleep, the child who dreams hardly sleeps at all. Children should have a nap in the middle of the day, certainly up to the age of seven years, and for children of active minds for some years later it is highly beneficial. It should always precede the dinner hour. \u00a3 The length of the nap may of course be gradu\u00ad ally lessened as the child grows older, and if for only half an hour much benefit will result. A child requires as much light and air as a plant, therefore south rooms, in which the sun's rays enter during the day are far more healthful and useful for night nurseries than rooms facing the north. Bedding. Feather beds should be eschewed by all who wish to sleep and who value their health. \"They are,\" says one, \"in every respect objectionable, possessing not one redeeming quality, not a solitary virtue to save them from the general bonfire, to which thev THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MONTHLi fought immediately to be consigned. Soft and warm I they are, no doubt, but they relax the nerves and de- k bilitate the whole system and predispose to sleepless- ness.

These utterly prevent the bedroom from being kept sweet. * Mattresses made of hair, moss, hay or straw are infinite]}7 more healthful apart from the objections raised from soft beds. It is preferable to have a mat\u00ad tress which is not too hard but sufficiently so to give sufficient support to every part of the body. It is found by experience that persons sleep better with this gentle support. Of course there are circum\u00ad stances by which persons who have been extremely ill and delicate and who are in a generally emaciated state, where the feather bed might be desirable, but they are very objectionable for all ordinary purposes. Then, with regard to the wearing apparel, on going to bed everything worn during the day should be taken off and hung on pegs, or what is better still, the gar\u00ad ments should be turned inside out so that during the night the impurities they have received from our bod\u00ad ies in the day-time may be carried off. Medicinal Remedies for Sleeplessness. A perfect harmless and efficacious sleep producer can scarcely have been stated to have been discovered as yet in medicine. We have two fashionable reme\u00ad dies in sleeplessness, namely, chloral and bromide of potassium, and we have individuals dosing themselves with as much confidence as they -would in taking: a glass of water to quench their thirst, deluding them\u00ad selves into the belief that these drugs are perfecly harmless. It would be impossible to calculate the loss of life and widespread detriment to health ensuing from the reckless use of these agents. Tons of chloral are annually consumed by the public, even without the sanction of the medical profession. R. Clark Newton, \"On Opium and Alcohol.\" \"When wakefulness has become a habit, its inju\u00ad rious effects are so marked, so distressing, and intoler\u00ad able, that the individual naturally and quickly turns for relief to some drug. Two narcotics have long taken precedence of all others as means of wooing sleep, viz.: opium and alcohol; and their employ\u00ad ment for such a purpose dates back long ago. Every\u00ad one is aware that, even the occasional use of such seda\u00ad tives as hypnotics is fraught with extreme danger, the risk is that a drug like opium proves so delightfully efficacious or adequate to the purpose intended, that its occasional use merges into a habit. It is the same with alcohol, and perhaps more confirmed drunken\u00ad ness results from its habitual use for the production of sleep, than from any other cause. Overwork, excite\u00ad ment, worry or mental strain, producing nervous ex\u00ad haustion |f this is followed by sleeplessness, and the glass of whiskey at bed-time to procure rest; The next night, and the next, and so on, the stimulant alcoholic craving takes root. The danger does not at first commence in the quantity of whiskey taken \u00bb bed-time, it is in the habit or regularity of the practice as a necessity to procure rest. If the habit is not speedily broken, in nine cases out of ten habitual drunkenness will sooner or later overtake the indi\u00ad vidual The intelligent medical man rarely prescribe* chloral, as experience has taught htm the extreme dan\u00ad ger of its use and certainly of its indiscriminate ad\u00ad ministration. Sleeplessness means not merely unrest but starva\u00ad tion of the cerebrum.^The only cause for regret in these cases is that the blunder should ever be commit\u00ad ted of supposing that a stupifying drug which throws the brain into a condition that mimics and burlesques sleep can do good. It is deceptive to give narcotics in a case of this type. The stupor simply masks the danger. Better far let the sleepless patient exhaust himself than stupify him. Chloral bromide and the rest of the poisons that produce a semblance of sleep are so many snares in such cases. Sleeplessness is a malady of the most formidable character, but it is not to be treated by intoxicating the organ upon which the stress of the trouble falls. Suicide which occurs at the very outset of derangement and is apt to appear a sane act, is the logical issue of failure of nu\u00ad trition that results from result of sleep. It is curious to note how a sleepless patient will set to work with all the calmness and forethought of intelligent sanity to compass his death. He is not insane in any techni\u00ad cal sense. He has no delusion. He does not act, or suppose himself to act, under an 'influence.' He simply wants to die, and perhaps, not until after he has made an attempt to kill himself will he exhibit any of the formulated symptoms of mental disease. Its habitual use is more destructive to human life than even alcohol or opium, and they are bad enough. Although it is admitted that there are no drugs of an innocent or harmless nature that produce sleep, yet there are remedies in the water cure termed therapeu\u00ad tics which will produce sleep and that without injury to the system; and notwithstanding this fact the or\u00ad thodox practitioner has seen fit to avail himseif of these remedies. Sleep affords an opportunity for repairing exhaus\u00ad tion and waste resulting from physical exertion during hours of toil, and in the absence of organic disease the principal source of disturbed sleep is in the quality and quantity of those substances we use for nourishment during the 24 hours. The tendency of all narcotics and alcoholic substances and food cooked or im\u00ad perfectly masticated* excess of eating, drinking strong tea and coffee, heavy suppers, etc., are all the greatest enemies against refreshing sleep. On the other hand the real promoters of sleep are tem\u00ad perance in eating and drinking, moderate exercise, composure of mind and extreme tranquility of body and soul. The mechanical position of till body during sleep is of importance. The body should be horizontal, feet slightly raised, the head raised cm a pillow about six inches above the feet, and the feet raised about three inches above the middle of the body. Sleeping with the head too h%h* unless the shoulders are supported, is bad t it feeodt ttts 274 THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MONTHLY and compresses the chest because of the interference with the breathing. Persons who are in the habit of taking heavy suppers or suffering from enlarged liv\u00ad ers should avoid lying on their backs, since the un\u00ad usual size of the liver presses upon the large blood\u00ad vessels below the heart, thus interfering with the cir\u00ad culation of the blood which will account to some ex\u00ad tent for nightmare, etc j| Sleeplessness is often the pre\u00ad monitory symptom of some constitutional or mental derangement, and as such, its causes should be at once carefully ascertained. Sleeplessness is ushered in from a variety of causes, and in the first instance the causes are very often neglected, ending in months of suffering, whereas if they had been taken in time, pro\u00ad bably the simplest remedies would often suffice to re\u00ad move the trouble in a few days. Of all human suffer\u00ad ing, there is no complaint so difficult to contend with as sleeplessness, i. e., when it has been thoroughly de\u00ad veloped. The longer a person has been without sleep the greater is the difficulty to woo it back again. It matters not how indolent the mind is if the body be active and vigorous. We have most of us heard of the Scotch plough-boy who complained that he never enjoyed a night's rest because as soon as he put his head on his pillow it was time to get up again. We may safely conjecture that with him physical fatigue was accompanied with the most absolute mental re\u00ad pose, and that like his brother of poetical fame he spent his davs \"walking and thinking of nothing at all.\" It is reported of Lord Brougham that when he re\u00ad turned home after his brilliant and exhausting defense of Queen Caroline he went at once to bed with orders not to be disturbed however long he might sleep\u2014 orders which his household obeyed,though with as\u00ad tonishment deepening into something like terror as the young lawyer's nap prolonged itself for nearly eight and forty hours. His'physician afterwards de\u00ad clared that this sleep had saved him from brain fever, though probably only the marvellously recuperative powers which he possessed, enabled him to take na\u00ad ture's remedy in one such mighty dose. His extra\u00ad ordinary capacity for work up to extreme old age may not improbably have been due to a constitution endow\u00ad ed with such means for repairing at night the waste of the day. On the other hand no one can say how much the irritability and acerbity which so marred the gem ous of Carlyle may have been due to his habitual sleeplessness and the nervous condition induced there- by. In these days of over-pressure, sleeplessness is a malady of the most formidable character, but it is not to be treated by intoxicating the organs upon which the stress considerably falls. With reference to habitual sleeplessness it must be fresh in the minds of every one as to the lamentable circumstances in connection with the suicide of the Dean of Bangor. The reverend gentleman was a man of considerable intellectual power, which is the same as saying that he was constitutionally liable to inter\u00ad vals of mental depression.. All highly intellectual men are exposed to this evil. A pendulum will al\u00ad ways swing just as far in one directi^a as it does in the other. Great power of mind'also implies great weakness under certain conditions. The marvel is not that great minds occasionally become deranged, but that they often escape derangement. Dr. Mayo says: Heat produces opposite effects in respect to sleep, it disposes us to sleep in the day\u00ad time, but interrupts sleep at night. In the day-time it oppresses, relaxes, weakens; at night it stimulates. In hot weather the entire quantity of sleep taken is less than in cold weather. On a change of weather in winter one is often kept awake, till he remembers that the clothes on his bed are too warm for the thaw which has succeeded. Cold promotes sleep. In the winter we. sleep- more than in the summer. This arises from two causes: our habits are of more active exertion in win\u00ad ter, which exhausts; and the cold itself, by requiring a larger supply of heat from us, likewise consumes our strength not to mention the disinclination to leave the pleasant repose of our beds, during which sleep again overtakes us. . Nature, if I may be allowed-the expression, has stepped out of her path to give this element of animal nature, namely, the relation of sleep to cold, develop\u00ad ment. Many animals hybernate, or fall into a winter's sleep, during which they take no nutriment, but remain torpid, their breathing and circulation being extremely languid, and their nourishment turning upon the ab\u00ad sorption of their summer fat. In these animals the temperature falls during hybernation, to obviate the effect of which they ensconce themselves under shelter, and many of them accumulate materials around them to exclude the cold. | It is singular that exposure to intense cold wakens a hybernating animal. Cold, as a mortal agent, destroys by producing \"sleep that knows no waking.\" The hybernating animal wakened by cold, sinks under its influence into a new sleep, and dies. Joseph Jefferson at Seventy-two. The Great Comedian Seems to have Found the Fountain of Perpetual Youth. \"In Florida, where Ponce de Leon failed to discover The Fountain of Perpetual Youth, Joseph Jefferson seems to have found it,\" declares James S. Metcalfe, in the Ladies' Home Journal. \"He is a picturesque figure. His ruddy cheeks and bright eyes give the lie to his seventy-two years. He is slender, but not with the leanness of age. His hair, mostly black, streaked only here and there with gray, and in length showing a healthy contempt for the fine art of the barber, blows about in the breeze. His fingers are as quick and deft at knotting a line or adjusting a sinker as those of a boy on the banks of a stream, and he enters into every detail with boyish enjoyment. His fishing he alternates with landscape painting, writing and the care of plants. In none of these pursuits does he claim professional skill, but he brings to them something more professional zest. Mr. Jefferson is a very abstemious man. In eating, as in other things\u2014except occupation in the open air\u2014he evidently be\u00ad lieves in moderation as a means to well living and long living. He did not join in our after-luncheon smoke, stating that if he had not given up tobacco a good many years ago he felt sure that he would not be with us now. Whatever the secret of his long and useful life, it is safe to say that- every one of his countless friends and admirers would be glad to lengthen it by a fulfilment of his own Rip's favorite benediction: 'Here's his health and his family's, and may they live long and prosper.' \" THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MONTHLY The Douches. By the Very Rev, Mgr. Seb. Kneipp. THE HEAD DOUCHE. (See \"My Water Cure\" 50th Edition, p. 89.) If the upper part of the body can be douched, why not the head? At the same time we must remem\u00ad ber that the head contains the most delicate and noble parts of the body, for example, the brain, which has been called \"Man's Council Chamber,\" the ears, the eyes, the voice. When these are all in perfect order and rejoice in health, we look upon man's condition as fairly good; at all events he can bear easily other troubles when these are all right. Consequently the head-douche is of great importance. It is applied by beginning on the right or left side, or behind* the ear and continuing to the middle of the head. From this point the water must flow quite evenly over the whole head. One can of water of one hose is generally sufficient, though in case of a robust, strong person two may be used. The object of this douche is to strengthen and keep in health every part of the head. Just as a tired hand gains strength by washing It in cold water, so the head loses weariness and gains strength by using the head-doiiche: The question may be asked, \"Why not give the head-douche at the same time as that for the upper part of the body and so spare a lot of trouble ?\"And the answer to it is: The head douche may not be given often and is more beneficial when given separately. If it were given as frequently as that for the upper part of the body, too much blood would be conducted into the head; and repeated wetting of the hair would pro\u00ad bably produce headache, neuralgia and other mischief. After many experiments, it is my opinion that the head should be seldom douched and even then the greatest care should be used in giving the douche. Of course, there are exceptional cases where the man is hardy and strong and at the same time has but little hair on his head. These exceptions are found among people whose blood circulation is regular and without obstruction and who, as a rule, lead very active lives. I have known country people whose heads were so strong that they put them daily under the water taps and held them there for some minutes while the cold water poured on them. Where people are strong enough to bear it, it does them good, but for begin\u00ad ners to act so would be most injudicious. The head should not be douched jvith other parts of the bodv, unless it has been gradually strengthened up to it. Those who have to take a head douche must take it with a purpose and with great caution. THE FACE DOUCHE. W The face-douche consists simply in douching the whole face in the same way that the head was douched. It is employed in the cure of ulcers, Lupus and other skin diseases which attack the face. The head may be held in any way the patient prefers so that the water is confined to the face only. THE) EAR. DOUOH E. Various applications of the e&r-douehe are made use of for deafness. The person bows the head as for the upper-douche and the water is poured from the water-can on one side of thehead round about the car and then on the other in the same way. The water i* not poured into the ear, but if by chance some finds its way in, it will not matter. If the deaf person has not much hair, it would be well to combine the ear with the head-douche so as to get a stronger effect. In this case, however, the greatest care must he taken to get the head and hair dry as quickly as possible. Two cans of water may be used for the ear-douche After the ear-douche the head should be well covered until quite dry, unless the temperature of the room is warm when it will not be necessary. There is no oL jection in going into the fresh air after it, if the weather is warm and there is no wind. The effect of this douche is to strengthen and remove blood obstruc\u00ad tions and disperse foul secretions, in short, it streng\u00ad thens the whole head. If one is very careful, it may be taken three, four and even five times a week with very good results. Its action will not be on the ear alone but on every part of the head, particularly where blood obstructions exist. THE BREAST DOUCHE. This is generally taken in combination with the upper douche. The patient bends one arm upward and leans on the other which renders 'easy the pouring of the water on the chest from the side. Many for whom I have prescribed this douche take it while lying on their back on a board and so get a good strong douche on the breast. This douche is strengthening and dissolving; it loosens the mucus in the chest and makes its discharge easy. \" It is ab\u00ad solutely necessary that the heart be strong and in per\u00ad fect order for a person to take the breast-douche. Bloody Flux. A father comes and reports the following: \"My wife has had bloody flux for some time and is dying; she may be dead when I come home. There is tic medical help for her. ^Is there no help at all?\" My advice was the following: the woman should takt 2 or 3 spoonfuls of tea from shave-grass every *4 hour later on 2 teaspoonfuls daily. She should put a cloth dipped in half water and half vinegar, on the abdomen the cloth ought to be renewed every 20 minutes an< applied for 2 hours. The flux soon ceased, and th* woman had to make use of the compress only twic< after the first application and each time for *4 how only. To repair the loss of blood, she took 2 tablespoon fuls of milk every hour besides the ordinary house hold fare. After 4 weeks this woman was able to & the work in the house as before. I must, however, remark that such application should only be resorted to in cases of need, until 1 physician can be had. A fV Jc7b THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MONTHLY Blood Poisoning. A house-wife had scratched her finger a little, and not minding the trifle went to bed without examining the injury; it seemed to her too unimportant^' In the night she wakes up, feels cramp in her finger, great nausea, and a little tendency to vomit. The in\u00ad jury was on the left haud, and she felt pain and cramp in the right foot. The hand, and the arm up to the elbow swell, become of a bright red, and within 10 hours the excessive pain extends over the whole arm. The veins up to the elbow swell and become dark- colored. There was no physician in the village, and there was evidently the greatest danger. Boiling water was poured over hay-flowers, and in these hot hay-flowers the whole arm was wrapped up. The arm, wearing the bandage, was then laid in the hot hay-flower-water for eight hours. These hay- flowers acted like a drawing plaster on the whole arm and drew the poisonous matters out of the blood. This incident shows how necessary it is to procure speedy help in cases of blood-poisoning. Perhaps in i or 2 hours this house-wife might have been dead. It is worthy of notice that even the tongue of this poor woman had already a bluish color. After 36 hours the skin on the palm of the hand was so completely de\u00ad tached from the flesh that it could have been stripped off. As soon as the cramp in the finger ceased, the nausea was gone. Joseph killed a cow, and, by accident, wounded his own thumb with the bloody knife. He paid no at\u00ad tention to it until he began to feel excessive pain, and his hand swelled so that he could scarcely move his fingers. The heat increased, and before long yellow and blue spots appeared on finger and hand. A physi\u00ad cian gave him some remedy with which the hand was to be washed and bandaged. I But the pain, which had got hold of the arm up to the elbow, became more unbearable than ever; the poor man felt that the in\u00ad flammation inside was making continual progress. I was sent for, and having examined the case, I prescribed vapors for hand and arm 4 times a day, each one of half hour's duration. During the time when the arm was not exposed to the vapors, it was wrapped up in boiled hay-flowers (to above the el\u00ad bow).* Every 2 hours, i, e., as often as the pain increased, the package was renewed. This proceeding brought not only relief but complete cure. The spreading of the inflammation ceased on the evening of the first day, and after 4 days the inflammation was completely removed. A gentleman cut his corn which was inflamed. In a few days the inflammation made so rapid a prog\u00ad ress that he could no longer doubt about blood-pois\u00ad oning having set in. Many, who had some experience of the matter, thought him lost. The patient took daily 2 foot-baths of boiled hay-flowers (these being * Hay-flowers are soaked with boiling water, then squeezed and spread on a cloth. On this the patient puts his arm and has it wrapped up in such a manner that it is quite surrounded by the damp warm hay- flowers. left in the water for the bath) and daily the feet were wrapped in cloths dipped in a decoction of shave-grass (every hour to be re-dipped in it). These packages were to be applied several times a day, each time for two hours; }Since there appeared other symptomes of blood-poisoning (sickly appearance and want of appe\u00ad tite), general applications were added to the above- mentioned partial ones. A lower package of iJ4 hours' duration and ablution of the upper body were applied daily. In a few days the gentleman was out of danger, and in 10 days he was perfectly well again.He took daily two cupfuls of tea from wormwood and sage (both herbs mixed). Such small foot complaints require great pre\u00ad caution. I know of no better preservatives than walk\u00ad ing bare-foot(be it only in a room, e. g., 15 or 20 min\u00ad utes before going to bed) and frequent cold foot-baths; for weak persons the latter may be lukewarm. Great care for the cleanliness of the feet is an important means for the preservation of general health. A stout parish-priest tried to give his thick throat a normal shape by means of iodine, prescribed by a physician. In order to produce the desired effect in as short a time as possible and get rid of his goitre he was rather extravagant in his use of iodine. In a short time the strong gentleman emaciated so remark\u00ad ably that he lost half the weight of his body. The physician gave him up,* because the iodine had pois\u00ad oned his blood. In such cases- the Water-Pfarrer is always good enough to make up for other people's imprudence,^ I wish this remark to be regarded as a mere joke which I wrote down without the slightest feeling of bitter\u00ad ness ! The patient took warm baths with a decoction of pine-twigs (95 to ioo\u00b0 F.) followed by a cold, but quick ablution ; he lay on, and was covered with, warm sheets; there were further applied to him^ the upper and lower gush, the lower package dipped in a decoc\u00ad tion of pine-twigs, every day two applications in the given order. Besides this, he walked bare-footed in the dewy grass. He took daily a saltspoonful of chalk-dust or slacked lime dissolved in half pint of water, to be di\u00ad vided into 2 to 4 doses, likewise daily 1 or 2 spoonfuls of Province oil whilst he lived on simple, nourishing household fare. ^Also in this case the water did excel\u00ad lent service. BLOOD VOMITING. Whenever blood is spit or vomited, it is of the greatest inportance to ascertain whether it comes from the lungs or the stomach. It is sure to come from the lungs when it is thrown up in a fit of coughing like phlegm, and when it is foamy and of a bright red hue; if the blood is coagulated and of a dark brown color and the evacuation resembles ordinarv vomiting, it may be concluded that it comes from the stomach. Blood vomiting is always frightening and requires great precaution, since it is infallibly accompanied by a greater or lesser danger. If the blood comes from the stomach, who knows, what little vein may have been injured, if and when the vomiting will take place again. Carelessness might have serious consequen-THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MONTHLY. ces. Therefore the injury ought to be healed as speedily as possible. Blood vomiting from the Jungs is by far more dangerous and should be attended to immediately. For both kinds of blood vomiting tea of shave\u00ad grass is, on account of its contracting property, an efficacious remedy. If the blood flows from the nose, such tea ought to be drawn up by it; if it comes from the mouth some spoonfuls of such tea should be taken every 2 or 3 minutes. As a rule it stops the bleeding quickly. The tea should be taken for some time after the cessation of the bleeding. I do not know of a single case in which shave-grass has failed to bring about the desired effect. If a person is repeatedly troubled with blood vom\u00ad iting, the causes of the complaint should be investi\u00ad gated. It is then either the lungs which are affected and the patient is consumptive, or a strong rush of the blood to the head takes place (s. congestions), or the bleeding proceeds from ulcers on the stomach. In passing by, I will say a few words about the bleeding of the nose. Many people have frequently bleeding at the nose and do not mind it at all, because they feel \"well\" after it. Yet their state is not a nor\u00ad mal one, and sooner or later a severe disease is sure to ensue. Poverty of blood, weak blood and their atten- dants; anxiety, fear, unpleasantness of various kinds are the inevitable consequences of this frequent loss of blood. I do not approve of the various ways in which people attempt to stop bleeding at the nose. '1 here are some that pour water over the neck of the patient, others try to stop the bleeding by suddenly frightening him, etc. The only thing to be aimed at, seems to me, is the regularity of the circulation. The blood which overfills the head ought to be drawn down to the ab\u00ad domen and the feet, which, with such people, are gen\u00ad erally poor of blood, and it is this poverty of blood that will cause many complaints later on. The following water applications will prove of excellent effect in this leading downwards of the blood: In the beginning a warm foot-bath with ashes and salt, for 15 minutes twice or three times a week; walking on wet stones, likewise twice or three times a week, and 2 or 3 short packages. When the system has thus been strengthened, upper and lower gushes and half-baths with ablution of the upper body will render very good service; one of these applications will be sufficient for the week. There is one kind of bleeding of the nose which is not only serious, but really very dangerous. A girl of 15 bled to death \\yithin two hours. The blood flowed from the nose as if discharged through a pipe, and the bleeding only ended with the girl's death. A girl of 16 years of age discharged through the nose 3 basinfuls of pure blood within 1V2 hours. The increasing paleness and drowsiness seemed to indi\u00ad cate her approaching end. At 2 o'clock a. m. I was called to prepare for her death. All home remedies had been unavailing; a physician was not to be had. Without delay, I had the contents of half a water-can poured on her head, the other half over the upper part of her back. The bleeding ceased almost instantane\u00ad ously. ,She girl lay for several hours quiet, but on account of her weakness, more o She had scarcely recovered herseJ bleeding of the nose began again, peated and nad the same effect.

The bleeding did not return, and a very good appetite made itself felt instead. In about 6 weeks the patient was quite well again, but although her appearance was healthy as formerly, the girl felt the consequences of the attack (great internal weakness) for not less than 6 months.

Home Life. \"Joy, temperance and repose, Slam the door on the doctor's nose.\" Nothing but \"the truth and the whole truth,\" pro\u00ad vided a fourth essential is embraced in joy and repose, highly essential to both, which is exercise. Life at its best is alternate action and repose, energy and devital\u00ad ization, rowing and resting. But, alas, poor human nature is lazy, and this, more than misdirected energy, is the cause of much unhappiness. \"We have left undone those things that we ought to have done, and we have done those things that we ought not to have done, and there is no health in us.\" \"Are you almost disgusted with life, little girl, Weary, despondent and sick? Let me tell you the loveliest plan in the world, Do something for somebody quick.\" That's it, do something for somebody and get away from self. A useful life is a happy life. Work for the happiness of others, cannot fail to bring happi\u00ad ness to one' self, whilst before self seeking in flies as an elusive chimera. Yet the successful man or woman must be a well poised, self-centerer. By making the most of one's self in a threefold development of body, mind and soul to the highest and best, can the life of helpfulness best radiate its fullest effulgence and far-reaching power. A beautiful but too negative character may be overgrown with weeds of others' planting, a prey to parasites, themselves far better for self-effort. Culti\u00ad vate will, energy, magnetism, be master of self, live your own life. Misdirected energy! Righteous indignation en\u00ad ters so rarely into any life that behooves us to gard against a rash and unwise anger without cause. In one brief fit of ill temper the waste of vital force is surprising, not alone the vital energy of the principal agent but all subjected to its baneful influences. A very old and trusted authority declares: \"Bet\u00ad ter & dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith,\" and I shall treat of this, the abstract or ethical, and not the material or aesthetic phase of home life. The individual is the center of home life, let him, of course I mean her as well, be at his best. As a first requisite get plenty of sleep. Some tempera\u00ad ments require nine hours; let them have it, as much of it before midnight as possible, but nine hours it should be even if an after-dinner nap must supply the de\u00ad ficiency. Growing children and adults under weight should \"neglect not so great a salvation.\" Sleep and deep breathing are certainly the best temper preservatives in the world,\u2014yes, and drinking plenty of good water. All eat sufficient food without urging, whether of the proper quality or not is another thing, but many do not claim their full share of oxygen so generously offered by nature, nor sufficient sleep and probably not enough water. Observe the temper and dispositon of your friends and determine whether or not the sweetest, smoothest, most harmonious ones breathe we!!, and drink water and plenty of it. Be cheerful; with the earliest waking thought seek the sunshine, find at least the silver lining to be found in every cloud. A sunny temper is the crown\u00ad ing grace of home life. If you have health you are blest, if not, seek at once and unceasingly, with all the hope you can muster, to restore the harmony of nature. Add to health \"a conscience void of offense to\u00ad ward God and man.\" Love yourself and work for others. All you would require in a constant close companion be your\u00ad self, for you have that individual ever present, never to be shaken. We know a young man\u2014and how we pity him\u2014 one of decided and pleasing disposition, spoiled by a too indulgent mother, no longer above ground to pam\u00ad per and shelter him from rash and reckless indiscre\u00ad tions, so far as one may shield another, a victim of disease, sin, misery, melancholy, and wishing for death. Poor little short-sighted mother, how much better to have trained her darling boy in temperance, abstinence, self-denial, love for love. In seeking the happiness of others, he would have found his own, eternal and abiding. Thus do the most beautiful, unselfish parents un\u00ad consciously, one may say innocently, foster the oppo\u00ad site qualities in their children by removing from their pathway every thorn. This may, in some measure, account for the conspicuous and too frequent occasion of worthless sons of worthy parents. Another instance similar to the above and simul\u00ad taneously brought to our knowledge is that of a beau\u00ad tiful girl, recently bereaved of both parents, after being shielded and indulged, left alone in the world unfit to buffet with the elements so suddenly overwhelming her; with sufficient means for a comfortable mainte\u00ad nance speedily taking to themselves wings for want of judicious management; without a home and home ties, innocent as a baby in her unconsciousness of so\u00ad cial peril, what is to become of her? Poor little in\u00ad dulgent mother, her guide and guardian still, perhaps, not far away we know, for \"are they not ministering spirits?\" How easily may a disinterested individual stand off and compare two homes, and note the secret of success in one and of failure in the other. The work of the world must be done, the work of a city must be done, the work of home must be done, and who shall do it? Some work too much because others shirk. Drones are more culpable than at first sight appears; they sin against self, as energy is hygienic and is es\u00ad sential as a generator of magnetism; they sin against others, because to the share of others must fall their neglected work, although already sufficiently taxed, and they become cross and ill-natured and the serpent enters Eden, invited by the shirk, perhaps smiling and sweet, and the last one to \"credit\" himself with the blame. A home of self-denial is a home of peace. Love lightens labor and dispels care.

Far away, vague and dim, is heaven, a place, while home is near and dear. A little heaven it may be made by preserving in its sacred precincts that har\u00ad mony or heaven, of present environment which is a sure attainment now as well as a fore-cast of prepara\u00ad tion for fuller joy hereafter, assured of the eternity and immortality of good, though heaven and earth should pass away.\u2014Alice May Youse, in Home Life. riental Science.

Address Paul Tyner, 28 West 23d Street, New York City. The Healing Power, etc. The healing power is a universal power in nature. It is resident in every plant, animal and man. The life forces are immediately set to work to remedy any injury. There is an instinctive faith that the power within will remedy the disturbance; the very demand causes its action to work intelligently. Man can help the proper action through his men\u00ad tal and spiritual modes or states of mind. Love, Hope, Faith, Good Will, Cheerfulness, Trust, For\u00ad giveness,\u2014all stimulate and intensify the activities of the building-up forces. But faith is the best restora\u00ad tive force. The Roman Catholic illustrates this who prays to the \"Blessed Virgin\" and makes pilgrimages to \"consecrated\" places. This power is able to attract to us all desirable conditions. \"Without faith ye can do nothing/* When we once understand that the healing power is within us, then we have faith. \"Man know thyself* is the real remedy\u2014knowledge that compels faith.

THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MONTHLY Cholera Infantum. By B. Lust, Naturopathic Physician. When the child suddenly vomits the just par\u00ad taken food, together with a lot of at first thick-flow\u00ad ing and then thin slime-quantities, which have a strong rancid-like smell., accompanied by '.repeated painful thin-flowing excretions; furthermore if th? eyes retire deeply into their sockets, and the skin gets crimpled in many places and the child has a peculiar faded senile look about it, then you may assume with certainty, that it is suffering from an attack of Cholera Infantum. This disease weakens the child's organism in a few hours to such a degree, that its life may be in the balance. Quick action is necessary in order to retain the child's life. If a medical practitioner is called in, who prescribes drugs to be taken \u2014 then the child is lost, as in this case the child does not possess the vitality necessary to sufficiently combat the evil in\u00ad fluences of medicines. The Natural Healing Methods have achieved here their very best results. If the child is not already moribund, the Natural Method of Healing will always save it; there is scarcely a single case, where it will not be successful. Even the parents themselves, if a Nature-Physician cannot be consulted, are well able to save the child, unless they do not commit some grievous mistake in its treatment. The causes of this severe digestive-trouble are, that the child is not normally healthy, having had sickly or weakly parents, or where the mother either had not enough milk to give the child, or where in\u00ad correct nourishment was given. Before everything, it isi the by me already so much combated \"watered milk,\" which causes most of all Infantile diseases, and makes the children anaemic and weak, and leads the already weakened body into complete misery. .The treatment must be applied as follows: To Under the existing internal inflammation of the in\u00ad testines, and also the diarrhoea, small cool enemas should be injected at first every half hour and then every i\u20143 hours. Round the stomach a wet stomach- pack should be applied together with a good woollen wrap, also use a warming bottle, to create a high outward temperature. This body-pack should be re\u00ad moved in about 30\u201460 minutes and be followed by a more or less strong rubbing of the child's body, In accordance with the strength of its constitution. Besides the above it is important to give the child plenty of fresh air, and a repeated change of underclothing.\u2014Care should also be taken in giving the child proper food, and nothing either too hot or too cold, and one ought well to observe, which things the child's nature demands, and which it resists. Mother. What a wealth of love sincere Is enshrined in that one word! Sweetest that was ever heard. 'Tis the name of all names <most dear\u2014 Diarrhoe and Constipation. It is a very general belief, that diarrhoea is a dangerous condition of the body, but this is not al\u00ad ways the case, on the contrary, diarrhoea caus^i mostly only a special cleaning of the constitution. All sorts of foreign and used up matter, which trough an unnatural mode of living or through a disturbance of the bodily functions have stopped too long a time in the body, come now into motion caused by some especial irritation, and necessarily force their way to the intestines (bowels). A dangerous case of diarrhoea, which also in it\u00ad self is a sequel of some disease, is developed only when a special overburdening of the stomach and digestive organs has taken place; \u2014 for instance by too rich victuals, and all kinds of drugs, which have a poison-like effect. If diarrhoea has set in, and a medical practitioner is called in for advice, according to his school-doc\u00ad trine a constipating-cure must be commenced, which very often causes a very serious sickness as a sequel, for it is dangerous and must be pernicious, to disturb Nature in such frivolous manner, when it is endeavor\u00ad ing to clean the human system. Treatment of diarrhoea is very simple; if it is caused by a wrong diet or bad food, either do not interfere at all, or perhaps apply daily 1\u20143 enemas with Tepid-Water, H> wash out the acid matter, which may still be lodged in the bowels, but otherwise it is advisable to observe a strict diet and moderate way of living; also to eat moderately only, and to par\u00ad take of nothing sharp or spicy.\u2014In case of a per\u00ad severing diarrhoea, where a wrong treatment has al\u00ad ready been applied, more energetic means will have to be undertaken. Besides the above-quoted clean\u00ad ing-enemas as advised for English Cholera, several remaining-enemas daily should be taken, a body-pack should be applied round the entire lower body (around the stomach and back), i. e. a wet cooling compress with a woollen covering, and let the patient go to bed to get thoroughly warmed. Constipation comes from similar causes but mostly from insufficient exercise.\u2014Children become constipated if anaemic, when they are not otherwise strong and healthy, and also from wrong treatment- Constipation occurs very often, when diarrhoea is stopped artificially and unnaturally by drugs. Tight lacing in women is also a cause of it, as all organs in the lower regions from the waist down\u00ad ward are forced out of their natural position. In men constipation may be caused by sedentary habits. There is generally a weakness of the coats of the in\u00ad testines, the muscles have lost their activity and are incapable to fill their functions properly, or the mucous membranes are impeded by some obstruc\u00ad tion to excrete sufficient mucous secretions. Both cases concur if the body is altogether sick and the entire functions of the body are disturbed. Purges, be they either induced by a household remedy or a Physician's prescription, are to be con\u00ad demned, as they all have more or less pernicious consequences upon the costitution. Even if the constipation is a lasting one, a natural treatment is preferable, consisting of retain-THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MONTHLY. fi&g enemas, the same as advised in English Cholera, j massage of the abdomen daily before meals or after Ingestion accompanied by a plain diet with plenty of fruit, Whole-wheat-meal soups, Whole-wheat-bread, etc. etc. \u2014 The treatment should especially be inducive to the mucous membranes becoming more slippery, and that the inactive coatings of the intestines show moiv activity. If the cure is not successful for some time, this is not to be attributed to the treatment, but ought to be ascribed to the unaltered pernicious original causes which induced this disease. Therefore not only a natural method of healing is necessary to effect a cure, but also a discontinuance Is the Summer Season Conducive to Health ? By David Paulson, M. IX of all bad habits, and wrong treatment. How to Sleep. Health and comfort depend very much on atten- :on to matters that to some seem very trivial. We ave sometimes heard persons complain that they did ot sleep well; that they were troubled with horrible reams, and arose in the morning weary and nervous, lquiries as to diet, exercise and other essentials of ealth have often failed to reveal anything that account r these unfavorable conditions. \u00ab * It is not well in these cases to limit our investiga- ms to the routine of a day, but we should inquire at hat hour the patient goes to bed, what he thinks out usually, and most particularly what position he aces himself in to invite sleep. If he lies on the back th his hands over his head, there will be a half con- ious sense of compression of the chest, with difficult eathing, to relieve which he opens his mouth. The coming in contact with the throat causes dryness, d then snoring will be begin. In the meantime the assure of the viscera on the large artery, whose irse is along the inner portion of the backbone, im- Jes the circulation of the blood, producing discom- which manifests itself in horrid dreams. Thus whole night is passed in a disturbed sleep, and per- )s many nights pass without one of refreshing ?p. The most unwise course under such circum- nces would be to resort to the use of opium, or any er drug. The ranks of the victims of this unfortu- e habit are recruited mainly from such cases as we e described. It is wonderful what control an in- idual can get over himself if he tries. There is no son why a person cannot lie upon his side instead he back, and keep his hands and arms down ; then will not open his mouth; * then his throat will not Dme dry, neither will he snore or have bad dreams, often he can't help thinking about his business, his thoughts will run on for hours. This is also ibit that may be broken up. Have the will to put e your thoughts, and in time you will have the er to do so. We do not say that there are not other causes habitually interfere with sound sleep, but we be- \\ there is a remedy for each difficulty, which may Dund by seeking for it. HERALD OF HEALTH. From a health standpoint each season of the year has its own peculiar advantages. The winter season, for example, with its rains, more or less sudden changes of temperature, and its occasional severity of cold, tends to produce acute colds, influenza, pneu\u00ad monia, pleurisy, aggravates certain catarrhal condi\u00ad tions, and intensifies eczema of the skin in those who are particularly susceptible to this difficulty* On the other hand, the lower temperature of winter is intended to be a physiological stimulus, and arouse the entire system to do its best, not only to resist cold, but also to rise above all its other natural and unnatural ene\u00ad mies, vfany who are languishing under the debilitating and enervating influence of a tropical climate, when they go north, and enjoy for a few months the benefits of wintry weather, become well rewarded by receiving an almost complete physical transformation. It must not be forgotten that the summer season is also con\u00ad ducive to health, of course in another direction. Un\u00ad der the influence of the summer heat, elimination, es\u00ad pecially of the skin, is remarkably increased. Under ordinary circumstances we eliminate a little less than an ounce of fluid from the skin every hour, but under the stimulum of considerable external heat, the sweat glands of the skin may pour out many times this quan\u00ad tity in a few minutes. Frequently rheumatics and sufferers from other forms of auto-intoxications are markedly benefited during the summer season. This is not so much be\u00ad cause they are saved from exposure to cold, incident to winter, but because of the more favorable condi\u00ad tions for the elimination of poison. The increased elimination, especially by perspiration, favors a large amount of water-drinking, which materially assists in thoroughly renovating the tissues. The debilitating effect of the hot weather can be largely neutralized, under ordinary circumstances, by simply taking once a day, or oitener, under certain circumstances, short cold baths. Some years ago an experiment was conducted in the laboratory of hygiene at the Battle Creek Sanita\u00ad rium, wherein the strength of all the important groups of muscles in the human body was tested, and a record made. The subject of the experiment, a young man, was given a prolonged hot bath, and his strength was tested again, and it was then found that there had been a most marked decrease in his strength capacity. The following dav the same experiment was made, except\u00ad ing that following the hot bath he was given a cold soray, and then it was found that he could lift as well, and, in fact, a trifle better, than before he took the hot bath, thus showing conclusively that the debilitating and weakening influence of heat can be beautifully overcome by short applications of cold. These cold baths should not be taken, however, when the system is worn out, or when the mind is se\u00ad verely overtaxed, as under such circumstances there will be a failure to produce a good reaction, and the desired results will not be obtained;! 282 THE KNEIPP WATER CURE MONTHLY.

Suppose a man fond of drinking, as nearly all we Ger\u00ad mans-are, were to begin from his fifteenth year to save daily thirty pfennigs that he would otherwise have spent for drink, in a year his savings would amount to 109 marks, 30 pfen\u00ad nigs. In forty-five years\u2014that is, at sixty\u2014he would have, at 4 per cent, compound interest, a capital of 7,063 marks, 30 pfennigs. These 30,pfennigs, -saved from expenditure on alcohol, put into an insurance fund to yield an annuity, would produce a yearly income of from 1,200 to 1,600 marks. A daily saving of 50 pfennigs (12^ cents) from the fif\u00ad teenth to the sixtieth year would produce a capital of 13,272 marks, 31 pfennigs, or an annuity of 2,000 marks. Extracts from an Address. C. ASMUSSEN. Civil Engineer, Hamburg; R. W. G. T. of Grand Lodge of Good Templars in Germany; Builder of the Celebrated Docks at Hamburg. Herr Wurm, member of parliament, still believes in the old brewer theory, that \"good\" beer will banish schnaps and prevent ruin. Another Bavarian, generally regarded the most eminent authority in the department of Hygiene, Prof. Max von Pettenkoier, says the contrary. He has re\u00ad peatedly declared that the above opinion does not conform to fact; that the increased use of beer not only fails to diminish the use of schnaps, but that the alcohol swallowed in beer produces the same drunkenness and a variety of beer diseases into the bargain. A. BAER, M. D. Royal Sanitary Counsellor; Head Physician at the Pen\u00ad itentiary, Plotzensee, near Berlin; Author of \"Der Alkoholismus\" and other works upon this subject. Not unfrequently, the children of topers die of heredi\u00ad tary weakness, not only showing a pronounced tendency toward diseases of the brain, epilepsy and idiocy, but they are also frequently subject to vicious inclinations and crim\u00ad inal tendencies. They lack perception for that which is moral and contributes to a steady, well ordered career. Weighted with the burden of hereditary mental weakness, they not unfrequently take to tramping, fall into crime, or become the victims of drunkenness or insanity. The ten\u00ad dency to drink degenerates not only the existing race, but also the coming generation. BINZ, M. D. Professor at the University at Bonn. This flooding the stomach and brain with beer so prevalent among our young students; this habit of drinking between meals, especially during the forenoon; this daily beer drinking for hours at a stretch customary among great numbers of the lower and middle classes in Germany, I re\u00ad gard it all as a national evil, whether considered from the hygienic, economic, or intellectual point of view. The habitual beer drinker is just as much an alcoholist as the habitual schnaps drinker; the only difference being that the former has less excuse, as he is not driven to drink through the hardships of existence, as is so often the case with the latter. \"Ueber Alkoholgenuss,\" Vienna, 1881. F. von BIRCH-HIRSCHFELD, M. D. Professor of Pathology at the University of Leipsic. When considerable quantities of beer and wine are laken frequently, it is not merely the alcohol in these bever\u00ad ages that is injurious, but also the temporary over-filling of the blood vessels, because that entire stream of fluids is obliged to pass through the* blood. All of that superfluity has to be equalized by means of increased action of the heart. Now, it is true, that a sound heart is furnished with considerable reserve force that enables it to respond to great demands on exceptional occasions; but there is no doubt that those who persist in making demands of that sort dimi\u00adnish considerably their capital- in haart power. The conse\u00ad quence of such real over-burdening of the Mood' vessels be\u00ad come especially manifest at middle age in the form of a weak heart, a condition we might term a strike on the part of the exploited heart. On the whole, insane people are not as dangerous as drunkards. Many more acts of brutality are committed b| drunkards than by the insane. Both the financial and moral condition of the families are much more endangered by topers than by insane people. When we consider that the most infamous outrages occuring within family circles are almost without exception committed by drunkards, and that within recent years these tragic crimes have increased alarmingly, we are obliged to acknowledge that placing peo\u00ad ple who have a passion for drink under guardianship anji confining them in an inebriate asylum is an urgent necessity. People with a passion for drink do not belong in a sa\u00ad loon, or an environment where temptation meets them a hundred-fold, but in some institution or territory where al\u00ad cohol is strictly prohibited. A clergyman in Pommerania told me recently that a man addicted to drink, who was about to emigrate to America, confided his intention of set\u00ad tling in Maine because the sale of liquor is strictly pro\u00ad hibit there; and in fact that man changed his life over yonder and has become perfectly sober. Based upon my anatomical pathological experiences, 1 have come to the conclusion that in Leipsic as in other large cities, a very great proportion of our laboring men, perhaps one half of our masculine population twenty-five years old and upward, manifest more or less organic injury resulting from the result of alcohol. . . . They show without exception a decrease in the number of tissue cells with a corresponding loss in power and endurance. Cited from a lecture. Mittheiltmg zur Bekamp- fung der Trunksucht, Jahrg.

At the wedding celebration of a well known editor of a widely circulating Hydropathic Magazine, a lady guest remarked to a physician seated beside her, her dislike and entire disapproval of the popular Cereal beverages, so- called food-coffees, with which the market is flooded. As the coffee-cups were brought in, and the air became freighted with the delicate aroma which coffee drinkers so much enjoy, she remarked. \"That is the genuine thing,\" and drank her cup of coffee with great delight. Imagine her surprise when a few minutes later she was told by the hostess, when she congratulated her on the excellency of her coffee, that she had been swallowing a cup of genuine Kneipp Malt Coffee, which the hostess had substituted to the other kind.

The greatly increased cost, attributed to the \"Meat Trust,\" and the question of the quality of meat products as now produced, brings the subject to the attention of the people in a very practical way. If Physical and mental vigor can be maintained without the use of flesh food then many peo\u00ad ple would greatly prefer to lessen the amount used, if not abstain from it altogether. In this manual Dr. Latson considers the matter fairly and shows quite clearly that all the food elements found in meat can be obtained by the use of other pro\u00ad ducts, as cereals, nuts, vegetables, fruits, etc., avoiding the use of foods that in and of themselves are likely to be unhealthful. The subject is presented in a simple and practical way, and many other interesting and valuable facts are presented by the writer. The booklet can certainly be commended to the thoughtful reader who is interested. The Symphony of Life. A series of constructive sketches and interpretations by Henry Wood. Lee and Shepard, Publishers, 202 Devonshire St., Boston, Mass. Price, eleg. binding, $1.25. The author presents here, in con\u00ad cise form the results of ripest study and investigation. For literary finish, poetic beauty, and practical sugges- tiveness, Mr. Wood's work ranks high. The New phy- losophy of Health receives thorough and scientific though conservative consideration. The highest evolu\u00ad tion is ably treated, and one or two chapters are devoted to Biblical symbolism. It is idealistic, but its idealism is practical rather than speculative. Able thinkers who have perused its pages predict a large demand for this book in the near future. !hristian Science and Kindred Superstitions, by Charles F. Winbigler, Price $1.00.

Modern Researches, Physiological and Psychological, in four parts. The Problem of Sex; Drug Effects; Vernia Caseosa; Difficult Parturition; bv Bayer U. S. Scien- tific Publishing Co., 96 Fifth Ave., Chicago, 111 Price, bound in Vellum de Luxe, $3.00, This is not an ephe\u00ad meral volume, designed to gratify the fanciful opinions of a curious public, or to enrich the coffers of a novice; on the contrary, it is a scientific work without a rival in ancient or modern literature. The author has refrained from the use of technical terms which the unscientific might have difficulty in comprehending, and for this reason,, as this work contains valuable information for all classes, it commends itself to all good-thinking and God-fearing people who have the destiny of their own progeny and the future of the human race at heart. The Christ of the Red Planet, by Eleanor Kirk, Author and Publisher, 606 Greene Ave., Brooklyn. Price $1. The author in her own well known forcible style relates her real experiences which to many persons may seem to be delusions from an over-wrought imagination \u2014and thereby adds force to an abiding conviction that Planetary communication will be made possible by the work of the seers. Illustrated Hints for Health and Strength for Busy Peo\u00ad ple, by Adrian Peter Schmidt. Published by the author, 167 W. 57th St., New York. Profusely illustrated. Price $1.50 postpaid. A book of great value, embodying an in\u00ad telligible and concise presentation of a rational physiological system as taught by the author in his institute with great success. The suggestions contained in this book have a particu\u00ad larly practical value, as they are based on personal observa\u00ad tions, which the writer made while investigating and experi\u00ad menting on numerous systems of Physical Culture. Al\u00ad though once an invalid, he is now looked upon as a man of remarkable strength. Anticipating the difficulty of following successfully the instructions given in book form, the author who in his college days had an art education, has spent considerable time and care upon the engravings illustrating his instruc\u00ad tions. The exercises and suggestions contained herein can be practiced by all, even by people past middle age: their effects having been carefully tested from a strictly physio\u00ad logical point of view. Apparatuses are not required!^ These lessons representing a course valued at $60 for only $1.50.

The author hopes that it may serve to draw additional attention to a source of disease extremely preva\u00ad lent but most egregiously overlooked.

Naturopathic Adviser. Under this column FREE advice according to the rules of the Natural Method of Healing will be given to all subscribers of the Kneipp Water Cure Monthly. N, N-, Louisville Qu. Suffering from Gout for a number of years I have been advised to try steam-baths every day, but I do not feel any improvement. What shall I do now? Answer: Sometimes it is even harmful to use a steam-bath in Gout every day. The uric acid which has accumulated in the tissues can only become excreted through the skin and kidneys in dissolved condition and being very difficult to dissolve we need a sufficient quantity of water. If a patient with Gout is perspiring too much the tissues will become poor of water and the uric acid is deprived of its agent of dissolution. I therefore would recommand you to use the three-quarter packs which are working like a big porous plaster and draw all the morbid matter of the body through the skin without depriving the tissues of too much water. Also you ought to drink daily the juice of 2\u20143 oranges. The lemon juice has a special capacity of dissolving the calcinatious formations of the uric acid. An exclusive fruit and nut diet for 6 to 8 weeks, then vegetarian diet will be very beneficial for you. Mich. B., Washington, D. C. Qu.: My 4 years old son was bitten by a dog about 2 weeks ago, the wound has healed but I am afraid of Hydrophobia, what prophylactic treatments would you recommend? Answer: Let the child have every week two electric light baths at Dr. I. H. Moore's (the address you find in the directory) and two bed steam- baths for a period of 4\u20146 weeks. Non stimulating food and plenty of fresh air. Rev, C. Pleasantville, N. J. I am very nervous and have been subject, to fainting spells and giddiness. I visited McFadden's Health Home last summer and live on a vege\u00ad tarian diet but do not gain in weight. I have heard that it is hard for a vegetarian to gain flesh. Answer: Every mor\u00ad ning a good rubbing of the whole body with a wet towel and exercises according to McFadden. Twice weekly three- quarter packing with a hot bottle applied to the feet, 1\u20141 hours; then sitzbath 850 F. about 10 minutes; during this bath pour continuously water with a dipper on the stomach, feet must be covered well with a blanket up to the knees. Every other evening alternate foot bath 5 min. hot and H min. cold, 3 times repeated. During the night wet ab\u00ad dominal bandage. In regard to the vegetarian diet I often have seen thin people gaining flesh, a young lady having been in our treatment for the last 14 days gained 17 pounds. Have three meals daily, breakfast 1 or 2 cups of Dr. Lah\u00ad mann's Cocoa prepared with milk, whole wheat bread, oat\u00ad meal or oatnut with tomatoes. Before dinner 1 cup of strong black malt coffee, all vegetables (except cabbage) with potatoes, rice, maccaroni, lettuce, raw tomatoes, fruit. Supper: Dr. Lahmann's Cocoa, fresh pot-cheese, whole\u00ad wheat bread, fruits and nuts; also eggs soft boiled. For the first week an enema of peppermint and camomile tea 1 quart every evening, then every other day of anised and fennel seed mixed. Before going to bed drink a small cup of Gentian tea. P. H., Providence, R. I. I am suffering from pressure over stomach, I am sleepy and tired all the time, urine is scanty, I am very nervous, having no more sexual power and cannot keep my mind on anything. I have tried five different doctors, none of them can do anything for me. Answer: The best way for you would be to go to a Naturopathic Sanitarium and to stay for 10\u201412 weeks. Have a cold rubbing of the whole body with a wet towel every monrning and hereafter general exercises 2\u20145 minutes. Every other day a three-quarter packing 1 hour with sitz\u00ad bath 850 F. 15 minutes afterwards, three times weekly a cold half bath before going to bed, y2 min. to V/z min. Sleep with open windows even in the coldest weather and be in fresh air and sunshine as often as possible, if you do not work stay all day outdoors, walk, drive, row, ride bycicle, but everything moderately and avoid-'exhausting sport. .Your diet must be non^stimulating and vegetarian. Certainly you can read the essays of Pentrice Mulford, also I recommend you the \"Methods of Self-Help\" by Ernest Loomis, Inwood on the Hudson. A. J. R., Lowville, N. Y. What treatment woul you advise for a case of Dyspepsia of 21 years standing. Stomach feels weak and inflamed, blood circulation is badly disturbed and it is almost impossible for me to keep my hands and feet warm in cool weather. I am very nervous and suffering from Melancholia, for the past 18 years. I have not been living but staying in hell. Answer: My dear friend you ought to have careful attention in a naturopathic sani\u00ad tarium, but if this cannot be, try the following treatments: Every morning a cool sponge bath and without drying off to bed again for 10\u201415 min. until you feel perfectly warm again, every day a bed-steambath with 1 hot bottle to the feet, 2 bottles to the calves and 2 bottles to the thighs, about 1 to 1^2 hours, after this packing a sitzbath 850 F. 10\u201412 min. with washing off the whole body and pouring water on the stomach. During the night a wet clay compress on the stomach and wet bandage round the abdomen 2 or 3 times weekly before going to bed an alternate foot-bath. Moderate exercise and plenty of fresh air. Enema 900 F. of the fol\u00ad lowing teas: Gentian, millefoil, chichory and peppermint. Every of tea of Gentian, Angelika and Juni\u00ad per-berries, every evening of shavegrass, centaury fennel seed and rue. Your diet ought to be principally a fruit diet with rice, thick soups of barley, oats, rice, tapioca, green vegetables, spinach, carrots, oyster-plants, tomatoes, lettuce, horseradish, one cup of strong black malt coffee before breakfast and dinner. Dr. Lahmann's Cocoa, fresh unsalted potcheese, toasted bread, Zwieback, a little fresh butter in the evening. Soft boiled eggs now and then. Ludwig Staden, 346 Schermerhorn St., Brooklyn, N. Y. India Digestive Biscuits. Among the many health remedies and health foods- which have been introduced during the last few years none has met with more favor and success than the India Food Digestive Biscuit manufactured by the India Food Com\u00ad pany of London, England, and New York, N. Y. This biscuit is a food and at the same time a remedy, for it will positively cure in a harmless way indigestion, constipation and dyspepsia in every form. It is made of cereals only and contains no medicine whatsoever. Its effect is simply wonderful. It will cure entirely Acidity of the stomach and absorb all unnatural gases as well as give immediate relief to persons suffering from Flatulency (wind) Heart Burn, Palpitation, Short Breath, etc. It tones and strengthens the digestive organs. By pre\u00ad venting fermentation the patient derives full benefit from the food eaten, the nerves become quiet, and healthful sleep is induced. Naturally it is a Nerve, Flesh and Muscle Food* It cures Constipation by causing the bowels to move at regular intervals. It relieves the Kidneys. By its action on the stomach it removes the causss that lead to liver dis\u00ad orders. As a Pile Remedy it has no equal. A boon to children as well as to adults. Thousands of testimonials sent from all parts of the country are full of words of praise for these little bene\u00ad factors of suffering mankind. Health-Corsets. have been a blessing to many a woman or girl, for, from the very moment such corsets were worn a general improve\u00ad ment and betterment in the state of health of the wearer will be noticed. For this reason we recommend these Health* Corsets to all those of our readers, who never had an op\u00ad portunity, to try their excellent hygienic qualities. I. Ufrter*- mann, the manufacturer, 193 Third Ave., New York, always keeps a large stock of these corsets on hand, which are made of the very best material and according to the latest styles. They are sold at liberal prices by Mr. Untermann. THE KNEIPP WATEK CURE MONTHLY, The Vibratile. One of the litest inventions of interest to every believer an hygienic treatment is most undoubtedly the above named mechanical apparatus for electric massage. Massage is hard work and every masseur differs in his efficacy of administra- ftion or in his knowledge of the art he follows. There is always a variation in his activity or pressure, and con\u00ad sequently the result while apparently effective is not always the same, because Masseurs are human\u2014they tire. The Vibratile never tires, never changes. It works with the same activity, with the same pressure all the time, consequently the effect will always be the same. The Vibratile is an electro-magnetic device giving mechanical effects only, and intended to take the place of the inefficient masseur. You carry your private masseur about with you. The important feature of the Vibratile is that it con\u00ad tains the various methods of general massage, i.e.: kneading, pressing, stroking, rolling and friction. As its name implies, the effects obtained from this little mechanical masseur is that of vibration. It is better than manual massage because there is no variation in the effects produced. The number of vibrations and their striking force can be changed from 500 to 5,000 strokes per minute. Can human hands, no matter how en\u00ad dowed, give such a range of adaptability? Here is at once an ever-ready instrument thoroughly hygienic, designed for and efficacious in the most delicate operation with a range for effectual application to even the great muscles of the thigh, varying in power from a slight tapping to decisive blows, as desired. We recommend this little Mechanical Masseur to all our readers. It will prove a great assistant to the hygienic physician. Oat-Nuts. Kneipp Water Cure Monthly* Dr. Lust, Editor. Enclosed please find 10 cents which is to pay for a copy of your health journal* I have not had your journal for two or three month*. I can truthfully say I believe if is the best journal of its kind. This is the reason I believe so; I have been bothered with varicocele more than ten years, which was daily growing worse, until I read the arti\u00ad cles, \"Sun Bath\" and 'Thermal Bath,\" which I could plainly see were Nature's own remedies. I used them without hesi\u00ad tation, and the result was a complete cure. I am very grateful to you and your associate doctors. I sometimes feel so happy. I cannot express my feeling, am so glad I found you, \"or that you found me. Just a few months before I read your and other journ\u00ad als, I had made arrangements with a specialist to have an operation, for which I was to pay $50. J have some friends I wish I could persuade to read your journal and employ your remedies. I am sure they would receive much good. I have been to every news stand in this city, but failed to find Kneipp Water Cure Journal. I have been laughed at because I insist on having it and nothing else. I hope you will reach your aims before you stop. Accept my thanks. Respectfully, J. E. WESTON.

Dear Sir:\u2014I am in receipt of your excellent little work on lun and muscle culture, I want to thank you for the good I receive^ from my careful study of the book. In these days of many hooks on the subject of physical culture, it is refreshing to read such a solid and common-sense presentation of such a vital subject. That man who will teach the publio the real secret of physical culture will be a public benefactor. In view of your theory of the primacy of lung culture, it looks to me as if you had the real secret. Very respecfully yours, (Rev.) SAMUfeL W. PUBVI8.

THE ILLINOIS OIL BOND uu. WE HAVE OIL AS WELL AS OIL STOCK TO SELL. OURS IS NOT A PROSPECT. IT IS A FACT! ORGANIZATION. The Illinois Oil Bond Company is organized under the Arizona law, the stock legally non-assessable and the private property of the stockholders exempt from corporate debts. Solvent shareholders do not have to bear the financial burdens of the insolvent ones and the conditions are equ^l - for every stockholder to win. CAPITALIZATION. Capitalization $2,000,000, giving ample funds to sink scores of wells, to lay our own pipe lines, build our own re\u00ad fineries, handle our own products without the restrictions of onerous leases with heavy royalties, enabling the company to adapt its progress and production to the requirements of supply and demand. LAND LOCATION. We own land in five famous oil districts of California\u2014 Colusa, Ventura, Fresno and Kern. Our location in Ven\u00ad tura iJountv is in the center of the oldest oil producing district in the state, surrounded by huge corporations that have yielded millions of dollars in dividends, some paying monthly dividends of 85 cents per share. Its exact location is section 16, T. 6 N., R. 21 W. S. B., base and meridian. TRANSPORTATION. This company has first-class transportation facilities for its various holdings. In the Ventura district there are 600 miles of pipe lines, and rail and tide water transportation to market and refineries. Our Kern River land has a railroad passing through the property, abundant tankage near, pipe lines to the railroads available, refineries near and building, and everything that a well developed oil district has crystal\u00ad lized into successful progress. PRODUCTION. We have not only land surrounded by numerous wells with abundant production, but we have proven land of our own. We have a steadily producing, honest, 200-barrel well. We do not, like new oil companies, have to take chances to get oil that experts say lies under our land. We have the oil. We have a dividend paying production. We are selling shares to put down more wells to get more oil in order to pay the big dividends like other companies. KINDS OF STOCK. Guaranteed\u2014This stock is secured by three per cent, interest bearing coupon gold bond that is legal, legitimate, negotiable and protects the investor against loss for the amount invested. This stock at present costs fifty cents per share. Unguaranteed\u2014This costs twenty cents per share, and is the kind taken by the principal people in the company. SALES OF STOCK. One hundred thousand shares were sold in ten days after Drganization at ten cents per share. Another block of stock of 100,000 shares is placed on the market at twenty :ents per share. NSTALLMENT PLAN. Investors desirin^ a large block of stock and not being tble to pay for same <at time of ordering should accompany heir order with one-third or one-fourth cash, the balance to >e paid in three equal payments extending over a period of jinety days. Stock to be issued to them on final payment Stock ordered at twenty cents per share may, by the time it 3 paid for, be doubled or even tripled in price. Both kinds of stock share equally in all dividends and rofits. * Dear Sir: Yours of the first inst. received. I have invested all my available cash and advise my friends in the shares oi the Illinois Oil Bond Company, because it gives an assured profitable investment without speculative features. The Company meets the three test requirements of a pregnant proposition. First\u2014PROPERTY\u2014Proven land surrounded by nu\u00ad merous wells with abundant production. Your company's well daily produces 200 to 300 barrels, and with the new wells to be drilled should make enormous dividends easily pos\u00ad sible. |p Second\u2014PROPOSITION\u2014Your proposition to furnish a security coupon gold bond that protects the stockholder against any loss whatever is a good one. Such stock I un\u00ad derstand to be sold at fifty cents per share. The unguaran\u00ad teed stock sold at twenty cents per share, which participates in all dividends and profits of the company, but is not accom\u00ad panied by a bond, is certainly a ground-floor, investment and one of such value that I believe is not often presented the investing public. Third\u2014MANAGEMENT\u2014The character, business abil\u00ad ity and energy of the management is all that can be desired. Respectfully, S. W. Naylor. Or enclose a self-addressed stamped enveloped to the Rev. E. W. Mueller,of Baraboo, Wis., who carefully went over our land in July, is entirely familiar with the transporta\u00ad tion facilities, saw our producing well, and was so impressed with the property that he made a very large investment in the lands immediately adjoining our company's. \"We understand the bonded stock of the Illinois Oil Bond Co. We know it is feasible, the securities ample, and the proposition safe for investors. We also know their statement about the location of their lands and the produc\u00ad tion of their well is a conservative statement. We are per- snoally acquainted with most of the members of the manage\u00ad ment and know they are reputable and successful business men. AUSR. 1. KERR'S REPORTS. Read the letter from Rev. S. W. Naylor, of Kenosha, Pis., pastor of Park Ave. Methodist Churh, who knows all bout our property. His letter follows: Kenosha, Wis., Aug. 2, 1901. D. E. Kerr, Secretary linois Oil Bond Company., 167 Dearborn St., Chicago, 111, Read what the Evening Post of San Francisco says of this company: \"Illinois Oil Bond Co. is under the capable and efficient management of the keenest, shrewdest oil men of the Pacific Coast. This company has land in five of the very best oil districts in the state, with twenty acres in the very heart of Kern River. This twenty acres already has a 200-barrel pro\u00ad ducing well, and is surrounded by some of the best pro\u00ad ducers of Kern River district.\" Also the Pacific Oil Reporter, one of the greatest oil trade journals on the Pacific Coast: \"The Illinois Oil Bond Co., recently organized, is under the management of careful, conservative business men, and is worthy of confidence in every way. They have some of the best oil land in the famous Kern River district. Their holdings are very large in four other districts of the state.\" We have submitted the proposition as it stands in this advertisement to Kerr's Reports Oil Rating Agency of San Francisco. This is the only competent incorporated oil rating agency in the world. They say: Our organization is legal and meets the requirements of a business-like investment. Our capitalization is sufficient for all development, ample to protect stockholders against the accidents and unforeseen circumstances and conditions of trade. The transportation facilities are such that we get all the benefit of the market readily at the least cost. Our present development and progress is on proven land with a dividend producing production. We own the land. We have a producing well, we have the tools to drill others, we have oil for dividends, bonds to make investors safe\u2014the business management that precludes failure. Our charter is legal, our by-laws are lawful and stable, our stock unassessable, and our proposition safe, rich, sound. ILLINOIS OIL BONO CO., Main Office, 318 Kearny St., San Francisco, Cal. Address: D. E. KERR, Mgr., Branch Office: 167 Dearborn Street, Room 507, Chicago, HI. im A PATIENT'S STRENGTH Medicine Does Not Always Sustain It. 5! BOVININE A CONDENSED FOOPJ Food, Food, Food is what is required, but in concentrated Form. Brains! was the reply a prominent painter once made when asked with what he mixed his colors. Brains! would be the reply of any modern phy\u00ad sician if asked what he gave to effect his marvelous cures. There would be as much truth as terseness in the answer. The same remedy is not always given for the same disease, in these times. Circumstances, the age of the patient, and surrounding conditions generally, are con\u00ad sidered. The first thing our advanced doctor attends to is the strength of the patient. That must be maintained at all hazards. Medicine can no more be carried to a diseased part, when the bloodhardly circulates on ac\u00ad count of weakness, than a boat can be sailed on a river whose channel has run dry. New Blood Must Be Hade. New flesh tissue must be built New strength must be found, and all this with the least exertion on the part of the patient. In such emergencies, beef tea, beef extracts, jel\u00ad lies, and other so-called invalid foods have been given, but they were* not satisfactory. Too much of the life- sustaining qualities had passed off in the cooking. Such facts as these led to the discovery of BOVIN\u00ad INE\u2014 the greatest and most concentrated Beef Juice ever produced.^ It is used and commended by physi\u00ad cians the world over. In thousands of cases has it fanned the smouldering embers of life again into a blaze, and arrested the progress of some wasting dis\u00ad ease. For infants, the aged, convalescents, the over\u00ad worked, or sick, it is a boon beyond price. No family can afford to omit BOVININE from the medicine chest. Though it is not a medicine, it is preventive of those ills for which medicine is given. THE BOVININE COMPANY, AT ALL DRUGGISTS. LONDON. PARIS. CHRISTIANIA. NEW YORK, 75 WEST HOUSTON STREET.

WE HAVE OIL AS WELL AS OIL STOCK TO SELL. OURS IS NOT A PROSPECT, IT IS A FACT! ORGANIZATION. The Illinois Oil Bond Company is organized under the Arizona law, the stock legally non-assessable and the private property of the stockholders exempt from corporate debts. Solvent shareholders do not have to bear the financial burdens of the insolvent ones and the conditions are equal for every stockholder to win. CAPITALIZATION. ^ Capitalization $2,000,000, giving ample funds to sink scores of wells, to lay our own pipe lines, build our own re\u00ad fineries, handle our own products without the restrictions of onerous leases with heavy royalties, enabling the company to adapt its progress and production to the requirements of supply and demand. LAND LOCATION. We own land in five famous oil districts of California\u2014 Colusa, Ventura, Fresno and Kern. Our location in Ven\u00ad tura County is in the center of the oldest oil producing district in the state, surrounded by huge corporations that have yielded millions of dollars in dividends, some paying monthly dividends of 85 cents per share. Its exact location is section 16, T. 6 N., R. 21 W. S.B., base and meridian. TRANSPORTATION. This company has first-class transportation facilities for its various holdings. In the Ventura district there are 600 miles of pipe lines, and rail and tide water transportation to market and refineries. Our Kern River land has a railroad passing through the property, abundant tankage near, pipe lines to the railroads available, refineries near and building, and everything that a well developed oil district has crystal\u00ad lized into successful progress. PRODUCTION. We have not only land surrounded by numerous wells with abundant production, but we have proven land of our own. We have a steadily producing, honest, 200-barrel well. We do not, like new oil companies, have to take chances to get oil that experts say lies under our land. We have the oil. We have a dividend paying production. We are selling shares to put down more wells to get more oil in order tq pay the big dividends like other companies. KINDS OF STOCK. Guaranteed\u2014This stock is secured by three per cent, interest bearing coupon gold bond that is legal, legitimate, negotiable and protects the investor against loss for the amount invested. This stock at present costs fifty cents per share. Unguaranteed\u2014This costs twenty cents per share, and is the kind taken by the principal people in the company. SALES OF STOCK. One hundred thousand shares were sold in ten days after organization at ten cents per share. Another block of stock of 100,000 shares is placed on the market at twenty cents per share. INSTALLMENT PLAN. Investors desirin\" a large block of stock and not being able to pay for same at time of ordering should accompany their order with one-third or one-fourth cash, the balance to be paid in three equal payments extending over a period of ninety days. Stock to be issued to them on final payment Stock ordered at twenty cents per share may, by the time it is paid for, be doubled or even tripled in price. Both kinds of stock share equally in all dividends and profits. Read the letter from Rev. S. W. Naylor, of Kenosha. Wis., pastor of Park Ave. Methodist Churh, who knows all about our property. His letter follows: Kenosha, Wis., Aug. 2, 1001.* D. E. Kerr, Secretary Illinois Oil Bond Company., 167 Dearborn St., Chicago, III. Dear Sir: Yours of the first inst/received. I have invested* ail my available cash and advise my friends in the shares of the Illinois Oil Bbnd Company, because it gives an assured profitable investment without speculative features. The Company meets the three test requirements of a pregnant proposition. First\u2014PROPERTY\u2014Proven land surrounded by nu\u00ad merous wells with abundant production. Your company's well daily produces 200 to 300 barrels, and with the new wells to be drilled should make enormous dividends easily pos\u00ad sible. Second\u2014PROPOSITION\u2014Your proposition to furnish a security coupon gold bond that protects the stockholder against any loss whatever is a good one. Such stock I un\u00ad derstand to be sold at fifty cents per share. The unguaran\u00ad teed stock sold at twenty cents per share, which participates in all dividends and profits of the company, but is not accom\u00ad panied by a bond, is certainly a ground-floor investment and one of such value that I believe is not often presented the investing public. Third\u2014MANAGEMENT\u2014The character, business abil\u00ad ity and energy of the management is all that can be desired. Respectfully, S. W. Naylof. Or enclose a self-addressed stamped enveloped to the Rev. E. W. Mueller.of Bafaboo, Wis., who carefully went over our land in July, is entirely familiar with the transporta\u00ad tion facilities, saw our producing well, and was so impressed with the property that he made a very large investment in the lands immediately adjoining our company's. \"We understand the bonded stock of the Illinois Oil Bond Co. We know it is feasible, the securities ample, and the proposition safe for investors. We also know their statement about the-location of their lands and the produc\u00ad tion of their well is a conservative statement. We are per- snoally acquainted with most of the members of the manage\u00ad ment and know they are reputable and successful business men.\" Aug. 1. KERR'S REPORTS.^ Read what the Evening Post of San Francisco says of this company: \"Illinois Oil Bond Co. is under the capable and efficient management of the keenest, shrewdest oil men of the Pacific Coast. This company has land in five of the very best oil districts in the state, with twenty acres in the very heart of Kern River. This twenty acres already has a 200-barrel pro\u00ad ducing well, and is surrounded by some of the best pro\u00ad ducers of Kern River district.\" Also the Pacific Oil Reporter, one of the greatest oil trade journals on the Pacific Coast: \"The Illinois Oil Bond Co., recently organized, is under the management oi careful, conservative business men, and is worthy of confidence in every way. They have some of the best oil land in the famous Kern River district. Their holdings are very large in four other districts of the state.\" We have submitted the proposition as it stands in this advertisement to Kerr's Reports Oil Rating Agency of San Francisco. This is the only competent incorporated oil rating agency in the world. They say: Our organization is legal and meets the requirements of a business-like investment. Our capitalization is sufficient for all development, ample to protect stockholders against the accidents and unforeseen circumstances and conditions of trade. The transportation facilities are such that we get all the benefit of the market readily at the least cost. Our present development and progress is on proven land with a dividend producing production. We own the land. We have a producing well, we have the tools to drill others, we have oil for dividends, bonds to make investors safe\u2014the business management that precludes failure. Our charter is legal, our by-laws are lawful and stable, our stock unassessable, and our proposition safe, rich, sound.
