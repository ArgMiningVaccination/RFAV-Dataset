If you are not happy with our products you are more than welcome to: Option 1- Credit: Return up to 3 (three) items for an in-store credit. OR Option 2- Refund: Return 1 (one) item for refund. We offer reduced cost samples of the skin care products and makeup so you can try our products before you purchase a full size. Please note option 1 and option 2 above may not be combined. See return procedures below. Exclusions: As the Henna Hair Dye Powder and Liquid are trial and error products, they are excluded from this return policy. Printed literature, mini sizes, sample sizes, travel sizes, and trial sizes are also excluded from the return policy. If you are using our natural health and beauty products for the first time, we recommend that you purchase one or two products to try. If you are happy with the results then purchase additional products on your next order. If you are using our organic skin care products or chemical free makeup, remember for best results follow our 3 Step Program: 1) Cleanse, 2) Tone and 3) Moisturize. By following these three steps, you will get the best results. If you are new to organic vitamins, alkaline body balance, or herbal supplements, start slowly. Take 1 capsule per day and monitor your body's reaction. You can then slowly increase the serving size of 2 to 4 capsules per day depending on your requirements. Keep in mind that you can always reduce your serving size and/or skip a day until you become accustomed. Certain formulas may have a cleansing action on the body. In some cases, this could be a good thing and should not be considered as a negative reaction. A natural supplement must be used in conjunction with lifestyle changes and will take longer than chemical equivalents. In some cases, even chemical equivalents may take months for measurable results. These natural products are intended as an alternative holistic health option, rapid results are not implied or guaranteed. Remember that herbal remedies are not medicines. In some cases, a health condition may have taken years to manifest itself and it would be unrealistic to expect results within a few weeks or even months. Please consult your alternative health practitioner and/or health practitioner and/or doctor if symptoms persist.
