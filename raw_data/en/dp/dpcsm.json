HHS achieves full compliance with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 and Office of Manageme nt and Budget Circulars A-11 and A-136 through the HHS agencies' FY 2010 ssional Justifications and Online Performance Appendices, the Agency Financia l Report, and the HHS Citizens' Report. These documents are available at http://www.hhs.gov/asrt/ob/docbudget/index.html . The FY 2010 Congressional Justificati ons and accompanying Online Performance Appendices contain the updated FY 2008 Annual Performance Report and FY 2010 Annual Performance Plan. The Agency Financ ial Report provides fiscal and high-level performance results. The HHS Citizens' Report summarizes ke y past and planned performance and financial information. DEP ARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES Public Health Service Indian Health Service Rockville, MD 20852 I present the Indian Health Service (IHS) fiscal year (FY) 2010 Congressional Justification. This budget request provides our most fully integrated and transparent performance budget to date and supports the Department of Health and Human Services' FY 2007 through 2012 Strategic Plan. Consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, this justification includes the FY 2010 Annual Performance Plan and the FY 2008 Annual Performance Report with FY 2009 and FY 2010 performance targets provided. Performance measurement and reporting continues as a mainstay of IHS performance management, including the quarterly review of critical healthcare date. These data are utilized to enhance the integration of a performance management culture across the Indian health care system. This improved monitoring capacity coupled with an increased awareness and commitment to the IHS mission across the Indian health system are our greatest assets. For FY 2010, the IHS provides a comprehensiv e set of performance measures that reflect essential health services with evidence-based linkages to improved health outcomes. The ongoing automated monitoring of these performance measures from the local to the national level provides the IHS and our stakeholders with information to assess ongoing progress towards the following elements of the Departmental and IHS Strategic Plans: HHS Strategic Objectives: 1.2 Increase health care service availability and accessibility. 1.3 Improve health care quality, safety, cost, and value. 1.4 Recruit, develop, and retain a competent healthcare workforce. 2.1 Prevent the spread of infectious diseases. 2.2 Protect the public against injuries and environmental threats. 2.3 Promote and encourage preventative health care, including mental health, lifelong healthy behaviors, and recovery. 2.4 Prepare for and respond to natural and manmade disasters. IHS Strategic Goals: Build and sustain healthy communities Provide accessible, quality health care Foster collaboration and innovation across the Indian Health Network. Our enhanced performance management processes have resulted in the improved targeting of our resources to meet the healthcare needs of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. And while the IHS has succeeded in reducing overall mortality for our population by 28 percent over the past 30 years, this progress is offset by a trend of growing disparities in mortality rates between the AI/AN population and our country's population overall during the same period. Our FY 2010 budget request represents the commitment of the IHS and our stakeholders to the Agency mission by working to meet the healthcare needs of the AI/AN people more efficiently and effectively with unprecedented and significant targeted investments in the Indian Health System.

Dupree I EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Agency Overview United States Government and Indian Nations The provision of Federal health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives is based on a special relationship between Indian Tribes and the United States. The Indian Commerce Clause of the United States Cons titution, as well as numerous treaties and court decisions, have affirmed this speci al relationship and the plenary power of Congress to create statutes that benefit Indi an people. Principal among these statutes is the Snyder Act of 1921, which provides the basic authority for health services provided by the Federal Government to American Indians and Alaska Natives. The Indian Health Service a nd Its Partnership with Tribes For more than 120 years, Federal responsibility for American Indian and Alaska Native health care passed among different government branches. In 1955, this responsibility was officially transferred to the Public Health Service. In the 1970s, Federal Indian policy was re-e valuated by the Nixon Administration, which adopted a policy of Indian se lf-determination. This policy pr omotes Tribal administration of Federal Indian programs, including hea lth care. Self-Determination does not lessen any Federal obligation, but provides an opportunity for Tribes to assume the responsibility of providing hea lth care for their members. The Indian Self-Determination and Edu cation Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA), as amended, and the Indian Health Care Im provement Act of 1976 (IHCIA), as amended, have provided new opportunities for the IHS and Tribes to deliver care. The IHCIA included specific authorizations for providi ng health care services to urban Indian populations, to administer an Indian health pr ofessions program, and the ability to collect from Medicare/Medicaid and other third party insurers for services rendered at IHS or Tribal facilities. Under the ISDEAA, many Tribes have assumed the administrative and program direction roles that were previously carried out by the Federal government. Tribes currently administer over one-half of IHS resources through ISDEAA contracts and compacts. The IHS administers the remain ing resources and manages those facilities where Tribes have elected not to contr act or compact their health programs. Vision The Indian Health Service and the role it plays within the greater Indian health care system is to work in partnership with Trib al governments; American Indian and Alaska Native people; and Federal, State, and local governments, agencies, and organizations to respond in every way possible to preserve a nd improve our health system for future generations of Indian people. This partners hip effort must also include the active participation of patients and the entire Indian health system in our common vision of health care access to \"medical homes.\" A \"medical home\" is a patient-centered, CJ-1compassionate, comprehensive, and culturally appropriate model of car e. See the full text of this Vision at: http://www.ihs.gov/PublicAffairs/DirCorner/index.cfm . Mission The mission of the Indian Health Service is to raise the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health of Ameri can Indians and Alaska Nativ es to the highest level. Overview of Budget Request The FY 2010 President's Budget request for the Indian Health Service is $4,034,625,000 in discretionary budget authority \u2014 a si gnificant increase of $453,501,000, or 13 percent, over the FY 2009 Omnibus appropriations level. The request includes funds necessary to maintain the current level of services provide d as well as funds to expand access to care and address Tribal contract support costs and essential health information technology activities. The following f unding increases are included: Current Services (+$166.7 million) Federal, Tribal, Urban Pay Costs (+$34.9 million) The budget request projects a 2.0 percent pa y raise for civilian employees and a 2.9 percent pay raise for Commissioned Officers. The $34.9 million requested will fund these pay raises entirely, including commensurate pay ra ises for Tribal and Urban Indian health program employees. Population Growth (+$44.6 million) This request will address the increased cost of health care due to the growth in the American Indian and Alaska Native popul ation. The population is growing at an average rate of 1.5 percent annually and th e $44.6 million requested will provide for the additional services needed for these additional patients eligible for care. Inflation (+$60.3 million) This request will address the rising costs of providing health care. The $61.5 million is the calculated need to address a 1 percen t nonmedical inflation rate and a 3.0 percent medical inflation rate. Staffing and Operating Costs for Ne w/Expanded Facilities (+$26.9 million) In FY 2010, three newly constructed or one replacement facilities will provide additional staffing. They reflect an invest ment of more than $36 million in the construction of the facilitie s to expand access to care in locations where existing capacity is most overextended. CJ-2Program Increases (+$297.5 million) Contract Health Services (+$117 million) The $117 million for the Contract Health Se rvices (CHS) program is estimated to significantly reduce denials in 2010. From the total amount for this activity, or $47 million, an increase of $17 m illion will be used to increase the Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF). This increase will fund over 700 additional high cost cases that were not previously funded by the CHEF program. Direct Operations (+$2 million) These funds are requested to increase the IHS' capacity to perform necessary administrative and management functions. The agency has acquired additional duties and responsibilities to perform without a commensurate increase in funding. As an example, since the 9/11 tragedy numerous personnel and information technology security mandates have been issued for gove rnment agencies. The $2 million requested will assist IHS in ensuring such mandates are addressed. Contract Support Costs (+$104.4 million) The increase in CSC appropriation for FY 2010 will be allocated to address existing CSC shortfalls associated with ongoing contra cts and compacts, and is expected to fund CSC needs; up 14.35 percent. The request for CSC is a signifi cant increase of 38 percent over the FY 2009 Omnibus level to assist tribal programs operate programs. New Tribes (+$5.6 million) Funding is identified for New Tribes to be funded in FY 2010. The amounts are projected based on the Mashpee Wampanoa g Tribe (1,422 users) and the Tuscarora Tribe (1,201 users). Indian Health Care Improvement Fund (+$45 million) The Indian Health Care Improvement Fund was established by Congress to address funding inequities among Indian health care programs. To diminish health care service backlogs, this program increase will be allocat ed to IHS and Tribal service sites with the greatest deficienci es. Funding will allow highly defici ent sites, those funded at less than 45 percent of need, to expand health ca re services and reduce backlogs for primary care. Chronic Care Initiative (+$2.5 million) This request of $2.5 million is for expansion of the agency's Chronic Care Initiative. The expansion will include up to an additiona l 100 IHS, Tribal and Urban sites thus spreading the improvements in primary care proven to be effective by the initial 38 sites. Area and regional Tribal staff will be trained to support this significant spread effort. CJ-3Health Promotion/Disease Prevention (+$.800 million) The $800,000 requested will support IHS Area H ealth Promotion/Disease Prevention Coordinator positions to coordinate, plan, and implement effective prevention efforts and strategies in the American Indian/Alaska Native communities. Health Professions (+$2.9 million) These funds are requested to offset the heal th professions education inflation rate. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, college tui tion costs have increased an average of 7.7 percent annually fo r each of the last 5 years. Health Information Technology (+$16.3 million) IHS' Health Information Technology (HIT ) solution (the Resource and Patient Management System) continues to expand to meet additional reporting requirements and provide increased but essential HIT services to patient s, providers and communities. Traditionally, HIT is funded primarily from the Hospital and Health Clinics budget. Increasing clin ical needs have led to increased spending on HIT to ensure compliance with Federal mandates, increased security needs, improved infrastructure, as well as ongoing and enhanced development and deployment of the electronic health record in over 200 sites. These increase s are currently funded from direct clinical care funds. This funding request ensures that these budget needs are supported independent of dir ect clinical care funds. Facilities & Environmental Health Support (+$.575 million) The Facilities & Environmental Health Support (FEHS) provides funding for the overall management of the environmental health and engineeri ng programs, including real property asset management of all, IHS facilities, technical se rvices and support for capital investments, budget formulati on, long range planning, national policy development and implementation and liaison with the Department , Congress, Tribes, and other Federal agencies. This funding re quest will provide additional support for the overall management of the environmen tal health and engineering program. Program Decrease (-$10.8 million) Health Care Facilities Construction (-$10.8 million) Funding for construction of new health facil ities is reduced in this budget request to focus on the provision of health services to American Indian and Alaska Native patients. Funds are provided to continue the construction of the replacement hospital at Barrow, Alaska; and continue the construction of the health centers at San Carlos and Kayenta, Arizona.

CJ-19Language Analysis Language Provision Explanation SERVICES 1 Provided further, That $18,251,000 is provided for Headquarters operations and information technol ogy activities and, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the amount available under this proviso shall be allocated at the discretion of the Director of the Indian Health Service: Language needed to ensure funds are used for necessary administrative and management functions associated with IHS residual. The IHS residual, i.e., amount of funding identified with those functions which cannot legally be delegated to Indian Tribes, has increased since initial Tribal shares tables were established in the mid-1990s. For example, new mandates for personnel and IT security have been issued for Federal government agencies since that time. This language will ensure that the total amount is used for these functions. FACILITIES 2 Provided , That notwithstanding any other provision of law, funds appropriated for the planning, design, construc tion or renovation of health facilities for the benefit of an a federally- recognized Indian tribe or tribes may be used to purchase land for sites to construct, improve, or enlarge health or related facilities: Added to make language more accurate in clarifyi ng which tribes are eligible for IHS services.

PROGRAM The FY 2010 budget request for Clinical Services is $2,949,8 09,000, an increase of $324,102,000 over the FY 2009 Omnibus level. This change represents $137,180,000 for increases in pay, inflation, population gr owth and staffing 4 new facilities and $186,922,000 in program increases. $1.752 billion for Hospitals & Health Clinics reflects an increase of $85,786,000 for pay, inflation, population growth and staffing new facilities and $68,320,000 for program increases over FY 2009 Omnibus le vel. These funds are necessary to support essential personal he alth services including i npatient care, routine and emergency ambulatory care, and medical support services in cluding laboratory, pharmacy, nutrition, diagnostic imaging, medical records, physical therapy, etc. In addition, the program includes public/community health initiatives targeting health conditions disproportionately affecting AI/AN such as specialized programs for diabetes, maternal and child health, youth services, communicable diseases including HIV/AIDS, tuberculos is, and hepatitis, and a continuing emphasis on women's and elders' health. The health information system for IHS, the Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS), is supported from this fund. RPMS consists of more than 60 software applications and is used at approximately 400 IHS, tribal and urban (I/T/U) locations. The certified Electronic Health Record (EHR) of RPMS is in use in a meaningful way at over 200 of these facili ties, with continued deployment activities underway. RPMS applications support di rect clinical care in both medical and behavioral health settings, case manage ment, population and public health, and clinical quality reporting. RPMS includes practice management and revenue cycle capabilities. RPMS-EHR is a critical component to the success of the chronic care initiative, as well as the health promotion/ disease prevention and behavioral health initiatives. $151 million for Dental Health reflects an increase of $9,448,000 over the FY 2009 Omnibus level. These funds are necessary to provide preventive and basic care, and CJ-56 over 90 percent of the dental services provi ded are basic and emergency care. Basic services are prioritized over more complex rehabilitative care such as root canals, crown and bridge, dentures, and surgical extractions. The demand for dental treatment remains high due to the high dent al caries rate in the AI/AN children; however, a continuing emphasis on commun ity oral health promotion/disease prevention is essential to long-term improveme nt of the oral health of AI/AN people. $73 million for Mental Health reflects an increase of $5,038,000 over the FY 2009 Omnibus level. These funds are ne cessary to provide a community-oriented clinical and preventive mental health serv ice program that provides outpatient mental health and related services, crisis tria ge, case management, prevention programming and outreach services. Ment al Health is crucial fo r the well being of AI/AN individuals and their communities; it must be considered integral in the healing process. $194 million for Alcohol & Substance Abuse reflects an increase of $10,640,000 over the FY 2009 Omnibus level. These f unds are necessary to provide preventive and treatment services at both the community and clinic levels. These programs provide alcohol and substance abuse treatmen t and prevention services within rural and urban communities, with a focus on holistic and culturally-based approaches. The Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) exists as part of an integrated behavioral health team that works colla boratively to reduc e the incidence of alcoholism and other drug dependencies in AI/AN communities. $779 million for Contract Health Services reflects an increase of $144,870,000 over the FY 2009 Omnibus level. These funds are necessary to purchase essential healthcare services not available in IHS/Tr ibal facilities including inpatient and outpatient care, routine and emergency am bulatory care, transportation, and medical support services incl uding laboratory, pharmacy, nut rition, diagnostic imaging, and physical therapy, etc. The demand for CHS remains high as the cost of medical care increases and gas prices continue to rise . The CHS program continues to emphasize adherence to Medical Priorities, enrolling patients in alternate resources available to them and negotiating discounted ra tes with medical providers. The bulk of clinical services funds are provided to 12 Area (regional) Offices which in turn provide resource distribution, program monitoring and evaluation activities, and administrative and technical s upport to 163 Federal and Tribal service units (local level) for over 600 health care facilities providi ng care to 1.9 million AI/AN primarily in services areas that are rura l, isolated and underserved.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS Hospitals and Health Clinics (H&HC) is by far the largest activity within the Indian Health Service (IHS) budget, amounting to n early one-half of the IHS budget authority. It supports essential personal health services for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) including inpatient care, routine a nd emergency ambulatory care, and medical support services incl uding laboratory, pharmacy, nutri tion, diagnostic imaging, medical records, physical therapy, etc. In addition, the program incl udes public/community health initiatives targeting h ealth conditions disproportionate ly affecting AI/AN such as specialized programs for diabetes, mate rnal and child health, youth services, communicable diseases including HIV/AI DS, tuberculosis, an d hepatitis, and a continuing emphasis on women's and elders' healt h. The IHS system of care is unique in that personal health ca re services are integrated with public health services. Collecting, analyzing, and interpreting hea lth information is done thr ough a network of Tribally- operated epidemiology centers in collaboration with a national IHS coordinating center leading to the identification of health conditions as well as promoting interventions. Information technology that supports both pe rsonal health serv ices (including the electronic health record) and public health initiatives is primarily funded through the Hospitals and Health Clinics budget. One-half of the H&HC budget is transferred under P.L. 93- 638 contracts or compacts to Tribal governments or Tribal organiza tions which provide these individual and community health services for the Federal Gove rnment. This is reflected in the outputs table which shows that approximately 58 percent of the outpatient workload and CJ-5938 percent of the inpatient workload is performed by Tribally managed hospitals and clinics. Most of the remainder is manage d by direct Federal programs providing health care at the local level. A small percentage of the funds (<0.5 percen t) is distributed to Tribes via many small competitive grant programs; examples include eldercare, children and youth, women's health, and health pr omotion and disease prevention grants. Although the health status of AI/AN has increased significantl y in the past 50 years since the inception of the IHS, the average life e xpectancy at birth is 74.4 years compared to the U.S. all races life expectancy of 76.9 and the U.S. white of 77.4. 1 The IHS and Tribes primarily serve small, rural populat ions with mainly primary medical car community-health services, rely ing on the private sector for much of the secondary and all of the tertiary medical care needs. A few of our hospitals do provide secondary medical services such as opht halmology, orthopedics, etc. Of 45 IHS or Tribal hospitals, only one has an average daily census of >45 patients. Nineteen of 45 hospitals have operating rooms; the majority do not. Th is speaks to their focus on primary and community based care, not on secondary or tertiary care. e and The following are brief descriptions of se veral specific activitie s funded through H&HC: Emergency Services - The IHS' Emergency Services staff office establishes emergency management goals and objectives consistent w ith those of the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland S ecurity, and other Federal agencies in addressing mission critical elements, strategic plans, policies, proce dures, continuity of operations (COOP), deployment, physical securi ty, and public health infrastructure. IHS is: (1) building capacity in public health infra structure and emergency preparedness through linkages among its hosp itals and clinics with loca l, county, Tribal and State agencies and non-governmental orga nizations throughout the country; (2) working to assure that th e needs of Tribal communities are addressed by States which have received targeted funding for emergency preparedness and response; (3) working with and expanding the capacity of 91 Tribal and 3 IHS local emergency medical services (EMS) by providing technical assistance to e nhance their ability to provide optimum emergency medical access, response and care in Indian Country; (4) enhancing IHS' ability to deploy staff for national and international emergencies as was done for the response to hurricanes Gustav and Ike, suicide cl usters in Tribal communities, wild fires in southern Ca lifornia, and flooding in the Grand Canyon, Northwest, and the Dakotas. (5) preparing its hospitals and c linics to diagnose and treat vi ctims of a bioterrorism or other mass casualty situations such as pandemic influenza; (6) measuring the effectiveness of IHS critic al infrastructure protection programs though a systematic effort of inspection and review; and 1 Pappalardo, JG, Freidman, A, Expectancy 1999-2001.\" Rockville, Maryland: Indian Health Service. 2007. CJ-60(7) participating in numerous local, regional, and national exercise s to test response capabilities and enhance linkages with public safety elements at all levels. IHS has developed a comprehensive emergency management program that focuses on strengthening an all-hazards response capability in the Agency as well as in AI/AN communities. This program has participated with other Federal Agencies involved in emergency response in Tribal communities to enhance information sharing and provide a common operating picture of Tr ibal community needs after an emergency to provide an integrated response. A satellite communi cations system and emergency notification system are maintained to provide backup co mmunications with the 12 Area Offices and provide a quick, reliable method of notification of an emergency. All of these efforts are in support of DHHS' role in enhancing the ability of the Nation's heal th care system to effectively respond to bioterrorism and other public he alth challenges. Alcohol Screening and Brief Intervention - The IHS has initiated a major alcohol intervention (funded through th e H&HC budget activity), th e Alcohol Screening and Brief Intervention (ASB I) program, to address alcohol abuse and injury prevention, very serious inter-related issues in Indian Country. It is aime d at breaking the alcohol-injury cycle by taking advantage of the \"teachable mo ment\" when an injured patient presents at an IHS or Tribal hospital emergency departme nt as a result of possible alcohol or other drug intoxication. The ASBI program is bei ng implemented system-wide in all IHS and Tribal hospitals. The ASBI is similar to the Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral, and Treatment (SBIRT) program of SAMHSA with which IHS collaborates. We are also working with the American College of Surgeons and level I and II referral trauma centers and their SBIRT programs. In FY 2007, IHS conducted six ASBI train-the-trainer conferences around the country and has trained over 200 phys icians, nurses, behavioral and allied health professionals in this interventi on methodology. In FY 2008, IHS broadened the scope of the ASBI program to include IHS-Tr ibal primary care and behavioral health clinics. A performance measure is being developed to determin e how well our hospital emergency departments and ambulatory clinics are screening for hazardous alcohol use in injured individuals in the 15 - 34 age range and providing a brief c ounseling intervention to decrease future injuries or death. Managing High Cost Pharmaceuticals - The IHS minimizes and avoids costs, through negotiated rates for purchased services, medical products, and pharmaceuticals. In FY 2008, the IHS and Tribes spent approximately $280 million on pharmaceuticals. While the rate of cost increase has been dramat ically reduced over the last 2 years (due to a number of high cost medications becoming av ailable as generic products and negotiated discounts through the Department of Vetera ns Affairs (VA) Pharmaceutical Prime Vendor program), pharmaceutical costs for the Indian Health Service and our Tribal partners has increased an aver age of 6.6 percent per year for the last five fiscal years. The interventions to control costs include greater use of bulk purchasing methods through the pharmaceutical prime vendor (about 90 percent of all purchases) and the 340B program, increased use of a limited but more efficacious formulary, and education of providers about specific pharmacoeconomic st rategies. These activities are closely CJ-61linked to 5 of 6 diabetes GPRA performan ce measures which are based on effective lifestyle and pharmaceutical management. The effort to manage high cost pharmaceuticals was enhanced by IHS pharmacy residency activities. The residency programs now operate in 12 communities and stimulate innovative thinking about the control of pharmaceutical costs and less expe nsive, but more effective approaches to patient care. Health Promotion/Disease Prevention - Continuation of the Health Promotion/Disease Prevention program in FY 2010 is contingent on results of an independent program evaluation conducted in FY 2008 to ensure IHS is investing its resources in the most effective health promotion and disease preven tion efforts. The IHS is increasing access to preventive and curative se rvices (secondary and tertia ry prevention) for Indian communities by targeting health programs reflecting community health status to provide the most effective services to the most peopl e. However, these prevention strategies are often difficult to maintain since the impact of the programs is often distant in time and community attention to these efforts may wane in the face of more immediate concerns such as treatment for trauma and for acute a nd chronic diseases. The IHS recognizes that clinical approaches alone will not reduce the ongoing disparity in health among AI/AN communities. Since its inception in 2005, the Health Pr omotion/Disease Prevention Initiative has focused on promoting primary preventi on among AI/AN communities to reduce the leading causes of preventable death such as behaviors related to poor nutrition, physical inactivity, commercial tobacco use, and ex cessive and underage alcohol consumption. Through integration of the HP/DP program w ith the other two agency initiatives on Behavioral Health and Chroni c Care, the IHS has become the model health system in integrating individual and community healt h, emphasizing both clin ical and community- based prevention efforts. Accomplishments specific to the HP/DP program include: Providing 33 competitive grants to AI /AN communities to enhance and expand prevention efforts focusing on behavioral ri sk factors that contribute to cancer, obesity, diabetes, and cardi ovascular disease. The HP /DP program is evaluating these 33 grantees to ensure IHS is inves ting its resources in the most effective health promotion and disease prevention efforts. Implementing the Healthy Native Communities Fellowship program that has graduated over 200 fellows from across th e country. This is an intense year-long program that develops Tribal, IHS, and urba n Indian health leaders to be catalysts for making positive changes in their communities. Partnering with the National Indian Health Board to promote and expand Just Move It physical activity campaign to get 1 million American Indian and Alaska Native people moving. Currently, ther e are over 29,000 participants from 337 partnering organizations and communities. Conducting Community Champion Forums in all 12 IHS Areas. Over 500 individuals have participated in thes e on-going Forums across the 12 IHS Areas. CJ-62 Partnering with Mothers Against Dr unk Driving (MADD) to train youth to address underage drinking, revising the Youth in Action manual for the American Indian population, and providing Protecting You/Protecting Me training to over 100 individuals in 6 of the 12 IHS Areas. Partnering with the University of New Mexico Prevention Research Center to develop the \"Across the Life Span Physical Activity Kit\" to encourage increased physical activity in schools, worksites, and communities. National training and dissemination will be held in May 2009. Building local capacity by implementi ng the Youth Leadership Program to engage youth and their adult mentors to address local issues and coordinating a youth summit in 2 IHS Areas with over 800 participants to expand best and promising strategies. Additional strategies include: Focusing on those traditional practices and values of Indian communities which have a strong role in promoting wellness. Promoting and implementing effective programs in schools and communities. Engaging youth and strengthening families to make healthy lifestyle choices. The agency is working closely with national yout h organizations such as Boys and Girls Clubs of America and United National Indian Tribal Youth, Inc. (UNITY) to promote healthy lifestyles for AI/AN children and youth. Engaging professional HP/DP experts, as well as Federal, Tribal, and community leaders through the Prevention Task Force and Policy Advisory Committee to guide this initiative to eliminate health disparities. Chronic Care Initiative (CCI) - The IHS has a long and succ essful history of addressing public health challenges and acute, infecti ous diseases. Today, however, increasing chronic disease burdens are challenging the Indian health system. Addressing this challenge is an agency priority that requi res a redesign of the delivery of primary care services to advance re liable and evidence-based care, to better integrate all of the health programs available to patients, and to put them at the center of their care. Fourteen pilot sites began work in FY 2007 in the CCI and showed improvements in clinical prevention (screening for elevated blood pressure, depression, intimate partner violence, alcohol misuse, tobacco abuse, and obesity); in cancer screening (colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer); in chronic diseas e treatment (control of blood pressure), and in patient experience of care (patients who w ould recommend their heal thcare facility to friends and relatives). This work continued in FY 2008; these origin al 14 sites laid the foundation for changes that will lead the Indian health system to make needed improvement in our primary care model. In FY 2009 the CCI added an additional 24 IHS, Tribal, and Urban Indian health programs and these 38 programs collectivel y provide services to over 400,000 AI/AN CJ-63people. The CCI pilot sites work together wi thin a \"collaborative,\" utilizing peer-to-peer learning with faculty guidance that is increa singly provided by natural leaders who have emerged in the early phases of the initiative. The sharing of know ledge and experience within this collaborative structure acc elerates learning and improvement. The collaborative uses virtual meeting technology, allowing us to reach larger numbers of professionals in a cost-efficient way and to open the health care improvement process to greater involvement by community members and Tribal leadership. The changes that the CCI pilot sites are us ing are conceptually organized by the Care Model which was developed at the MacColl Institute for Healthcare Innovation and tested and implemented widely in the U.S. and abroad. These changes crosswalk closely with published concepts of the \"medical hom e\" and rely on the full optimization of the IHS clinical information system. A broad a nd comprehensive measurement plan guides improvement in the four domains of clinical prevention, care of chronic conditions, patient experience of care, and the cost of care. In the next year these health care programs will leverage changes in the delivery of health care and the use of the clinical information system to improve patient self-management skills and to create patient care teams with increased efficiency, effectiveness, and continuity of care. This will provide local sites with the skills and tools to support ongoing health care system improvement. Par ticipating programs will share learning and experience in a collaborative fashion to in crease their chances of success and speed of change. Outcome evaluation of clinical system ch anges will be based upon existing performance measures. As the number of sites joining the CCI in this effort expands, the effect on the majority of H&HC performance measures will increase. Because of the emphasis on clinical screening as well as chronic dis ease management, the CCI will directly impact most of the H&HC measures such as the 6 diabetes measures, the 3 cancer screening measures, the 3 immunization measures, etc. In addition, new measurements will be developed as appropriate. Area and regional Tribal staff are being traine d to support a significant spread effort in FY 2010. In that fiscal year, the work will be made available to an additional 100 IHS, Tribal, and Urban sites spreading the impr ovements in primary care proven to be effective by the initial sites.

This increase represents $85,786,000 for pay increases, inflation, population growth and staffing new facilities and $68,320,000 for program increases. Hospitals and Health Clinics funding will provide personal health care services for acute, chronic, and emergency condi tions as well as clinical preventive services for approximately 1.9 million people; public/commun ity health initiatives targeting health conditions affecting AI/AN; health promotion and dis ease prevention; emergency preparedness and response; and complex he alth information technology that supports both personal health services and public health initiatives. Program increases: $3.226 million for 2 newly Federally recognized Tribes to begin providing health services. $45.543 million for the Indian Health Care Improvement Act Fund (IHCIF). The IHCIF methodology compares the current funding of health care delivery sites relative to a benchmark cost for a standard benefits package. The formula allocates funds to sites with the lowest scores. The benchmark c onsiders site user counts, population health status, prev ailing health care costs, a nd an estimate for Medicare and Medicaid funding. In FY 2010, the IHS will conduct a thorough evaluation of the methodology and data sources utilized to distribute the IHCIF and will take action to improve and refine the formula if necessary. $2.5 million for expansion of the agency's Chronic Care Initiative: The expansion will include up to an additional 100 IHS, Tr ibal, and Urban sites thus spreading the improvements in primary care proven to be effective by the initial 38 sites. Area and regional Tribal staff will be trained to s upport this significant spread effort. $0.8 million for expansion of the agency's Health Promotion/Disease Prevention Initiative. The Recovery Act will enable IHS to create and acquire new enhancements. Funding distribution : Approximately $919 million to be distributed to Federally-administered hospitals and clinics. Approximately $832 million to be distribute d to Tribally operated hospitals and clinics through P.L. 93-638 compacts and contracts to provide similar services that the IHS would provide if these programs were directly Federally administered.

These m easures include a variety of clinical measures such as prenatal HIV screening, pap smear and mammography screening, domestic violence screening, immunization rates, community-based cardiovascular disease and obesity prev ention, depression screening, and reducing tobacco usage. Although the IHS has many more clinical measures, these 17 are the only ones being reported as national performance me asures and only evaluate the performance of a portion of the clin ical care program, as all aspects of primary and some secondary clinical care of individuals, involving thousands of diseas e states, are provided through the H&HC budget. Each of the approximat ely 1.9 million individuals cared for in the Indian Health System is unique and requires individual attention and care, so that each individual is a unique \"output .\" Assessing performance data from the most current reported data demonstrates effective H&HC outcomes. In FY 2008, the IHS met or exceeded 12 H&HC performance measures, wher eas two were not met, establishment of baseline rates and the TOHP sub-components are not included in this count . Those not met were each only 1 percent under the goal; e.g. the target for controlled blood pressure in diabetic patients was 39 percent but only 38 percent was achieved. Some of these performance measures are very resource inte nsive. The level of performance measure achievement is similar to that for the past several years. Two of the 21 key GPRA results of program s funded through H&HC will be discussed. These are just examples from the key m easures and are not n ecessarily any more important than the other 17 measures. Most of these measures relate to direct clinical care and are all important for the agency to meet its mission of elevating the health of Indian people to the highest level. Diabetes - The agency continues to make signifi cant progress in addressing chronic diseases. A primary focus has been in the treatment and prevention of diabetes and its complications. Diabetes continues to be a growing problem in AI/AN communities. Of particular concern, the incide nce of the disease is increasing rapidly in youth and young adults. Supplemental funding, key Tribal involveme nt, collaboration with other Federal agencies, and community emphasis all contributed to the IHS meeting or exceeding four of six diabetes performance measures. Ongoing interventions include more effective pharmaceuticals, more aggressive screening for the secondary effects of diabetes, earlier intervention when complications are id entified, and emphasizing greater patient compliance with care regimens. The level a nd quality of services provided to over CJ-66100,000 diabetics throughout the IH S are audited annually to improve standardized care and patient outcomes. A wide range of IH S developed performan ce measures including foot care, eye care, end orga n status, and adequacy of bl ood sugar control have been incorporated into the National Committee for Quality Assurance/American Diabetes Association national performance diabetes care benchmarks. Six of these are reported as GPRA indicators. Over two-thirds of Tr ibal communities have programs in place for community-wide prevention of diabetes, and 83 percent of Tribal communities offer primary prevention programs for children and youth. Diabetes is the leading cause of end stag e renal disease (ESRD) or kidney failure, a growing problem in Indian communities. Earl y identification of patients at risk through screening for protein in the urin e (proteinuria) helps prevent or delay the need for dialysis or renal transplant. Proteinuria is also an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease, the number one killer of AI/AN adults. In co njunction with other di abetes standards of care (blood sugar control and blood pressure co ntrol), this GPRA performance measure is intended to increase screening of diabetic pati ents for nephropathy in order to prevent or delay kidney failure by use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, medications proven to delay or prevent the onset of kidney failure . IHS use of ACE inhibitors has been steadily increasing si nce 1993. And since 1996 the rate of new cases of kidney failure in AI/AN patie nts with diabetes has been decreasing, while the rates continue to rise in African American and Caucasian diab etic populations. For FY 2007, this measure was changed to require quantitativ e testing in addition to or instead of the previous qualitative screening method, and a new baseline was established at 40%. The change in the measure was done in order to encourage a better assessment of diabetes related kidney damage. In FY 2008 IHS exceeded the target of 40 percent by an additional 10 percent of patients assessed. Accreditation/Certification -The Joint Commission (JC), the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC), and the Centers for Medi care and Medicaid Services (CMS) regularly conduct in-depth qua lity reviews of IHS and Tribal hospitals and clinics. The average accreditation status levels are consistent with the average levels for all U.S. hospitals. The most frequently cited area for improvement is Life Safety Code Compliance because some IHS facili ties are old and cannot be maintained adequately for the current array of services. The average age of IHS facilities is greater than 30 years. IHS met this performance measure in FY 2008 as four IHS hospitals were evaluated by either the JC or CMS; all remain accredited or certified. The four hospitals surveyed in FY 2008 were Sells, in the Tucson Area, Hopi Health Center, Phoenix Indian Medical Center, and San Carlos in the Phoenix Area. IHS also achieved its goal of 100 percent accreditation of ambulatory faci lities. Accreditation contributes both directly and indirectly to improve clinical safety a nd is essential for maximizing third-party collections. The local IHS multidisciplinar y team approach to accreditation and ongoing quality management, with guidance and support from Area staff, has been the mainstay of success. This is one of the most de manding measures to meet, given the growing clinical quality of care assessmen ts that are required as well as issues related to health facilities maintenance and renovation that are critical to accreditation. Measuring CJ-67accreditation and certification is a very important performance element because these periodic external review processes help monitor that basic policies and procedures, staffing, and patient care outcomes monitoring mechanisms are in place to ensure that consistent high quality patient care is being provided safely. In FY 2010, the IHS expects to maintain 100% accreditation or certification of its facilities. Federally Administered Activities and Tribally operated programs have also participated in program assessments. Both programs have been successful in pe rformance reporting, utilizing subsets of national GPRA measures to demonstrate achievement in addressing the major health disparities facing the AI/AN population. For example, IHS recently developed and released a 40-page guidance doc ument with specific clinical strategies based on childhood obesity prevention and treatm ent for provider use.

The intent was to develop Epidemiology Centers and public health infrastructure by augmenting exis ting tribal organizations with expertise in epidemiology and support. Epidemiology provides the foundation for all pub lic health activities. Tribal governments and health facilities as well as IHS direct-s ervice sites already deliver public health services such as immunization and cancer prevention and control programs to American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities throughout th e country. More efficient service delivery and development of effective interventions to improve health requires in- depth knowledge of the causes of illne ss and mortality among the population and epidemiology provides that knowledge. The IHS Division of Epidemiology and Dis ease Prevention (DEDP) is the national coordinating center and collabora tes with the 12 TECs to collec t, analyze, interpret, and disseminate health information critical to identifying diseases to target, suggesting strategies for successful interventions and tes ting the effectiveness of health interventions that have been implemented. CJ-71 Initially, four TECs competed and received recommendations from an objective review panel. They received funding of up to $155,000 each through cooperative agreements with Tribes and Tribal organizations , such as Indian health boards. In FY 2000, the four original TECs plus two new centers received funding for five years. Three new TECs were added in FY 2005 and in FY 2006, after the most recent competitive 5-year cooperative agreement award process, the IHS TEC program was expanded to include 11 TECs. In FY 2008, IHS continued to fund 11 Tribal epidemiology centers, the IHS national coordinating center in Albuquerque and additionally, one new TEC in Californi a was recognized and funded by the IHS Director's office. All 12 existing TECs now serve a major portion of the AI/AN population in 12 regions comparable to the IHS Areas. In FY 2010, the IHS will continue to enhance th e ability of the Indian health system to collect and manage data more effectivel y to better understand and develop the link between public health problems and behavior , socioeconomic conditions, and geography. The IHS will also continue to support the TEC program in their efforts to provide technical training in public health practic e and prevention-oriented research and promoting public health career pathways for tribal communities and members. In FY 2010, this will be the final year of the 5-year cooperative agreement. Activities will be finalized and summarized among the TECs. Preparations will be made for competing and issuing a new cycle of funding thr ough the cooperative agreement process. Operating from within Tribal organizations, TECs are unique in thei r position to provide support to local disease surveillance and control program s, and in assessing the effectiveness of public health programs. In addition, TECs work to improve data needed for GPRA reporting and monitoring of the Healthy People 2010 obj ectives. All TECs monitor the health status of tribes in their region, producing reports annually or biannually for constituent tribes. Following standardization of th ese reports across all TECs in FY 2008, the IHS National Coordina ting Center will produce a composite picture of Indian health. TECs provide critical support to Tribes who self-govern thei r health programs. Data generated locally and analyzed by TECs en able Tribes to evaluate Tribal and community-specific health status data so that planning and decision-making can best meet the needs of their Tribal membership. B ecause these data are used at the local level, immediate feedback is provided to the loca l data systems which also can lead to improvements in Indian health data overall. IHS health priorities, as determined by Tribal recommendations, ofte n might be a direct result of the work of TECs. All TECs strive to monitor health status of tribes in their region, producing reports annually or biannually for constituent tribes. About 90 percent of the TECs budget is distributed through Cooperative Agreements . A fully staffed TEC would be composed of at least one physician or doctoral-level CJ-72 epidemiologist, two Masters-level epidemiologi sts, one statisticia n, and support staff. Funding for each TEC is authorized up to $1,000,000.

This request also includes $350,000 to fund the California Rural Indian Health Board TEC. OUTCOMES No specific national-level outcomes have been set for this project because each TEC sets goals and determines outcomes independently as directed by their constituent tribes and health boards. CJ-73 OUTPUTS TABLE In the expanding environment of Tribally operated health programs, epidemiology centers provide additional public health services, such as di sease control and prevention programs. Some existing centers provide addi tional assistance to Tribal participants in such areas as sexually transmitted disease control and HIV and cancer prevention. They also assist Tribes in activities such as conduc ting behavioral risk factor surveys in order to establish baseline data for successfu lly evaluating intervention and prevention activities. The TEC program continues to support tr ibal communities by providing technical training in public health pr actice and prevention-oriented research and promoting public health career pathways for tribal members. Efforts to supplemen t the TEC programs are coordinated with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to optimize fe deral resource utilization, create stronger interagency partnerships, and preven t costly duplication of effort.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS Health Information Technology (HIT ) - Health care is information intensive and dependent on technology to assure that a ppropriate health info rmation is available whenever and wherever the data is neede d. Information technology is essential to effective health care delivery and efficien t resource management in the IHS. The IHS HIT is based on an architecture that incor porates government and industry standards for the collection, processing and transmission of information. IHS HIT is managed as strategic investments by senior management, fu lly integrated with the agency's programs, and critical to improving service delivery as reflected in this and other budget activity narratives and displayed in the accompanying budget exhibits. The IHS has a long history of successfully integrating h ealth information technology and health service delivery. The Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) is the IHS enterprise health information system. RPMS consists of more th an 60 software applications and is used at approximately 400 IHS, tribal and urban (I/T/U) locations. The RPMS Certified Electronic Health Record (EHR ) is in use in a meaningful way at over 200 of these facilities, with continued deployment activit ies underway. RPMS applications support direct clinical care in both medical and behavioral health settings, case management, population and public health, and clinical quality re porting; the suite also include practice management and revenue cycle capabilities. RPMS-EHR is a critical component to the success of the chronic care initi ative, as well as the health promotion/ disease prevention and behavioral health initiatives. CJ-75 Costs of the IHS IT infrastructure (developm ent, support, licensing, contracts, bandwidth, training of staff, and others) have risen dram atically in the past decade. Information technology helps ensure that IH S is able to meet these needs. The RPMS application suite is considered a leadi ng HIT system in many areas, including wellness, population and public health, chronic care management a nd electronic clinical quality reporting. The IHS works closely with the Office of the Na tional Coordinator for Health Information Technology, Centers for Medicare and Medi caid Services, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Veterans Health Admini stration, Department of Defense, and other Federal entities on IT initiatives to ensure that the direction of our HIT system is consistent with other Federal agencies. In addition, IHS has routinely shared HIT artifacts (design and requirement documents, clin ical quality logic, et c.) with both public and private organizations. IHS has also continued to expand its support fo r telehealth. Telehealth enables a \"best practice\" model of specialist health care de livery. Such a model of enhanced access, improved clinical quality, and organizatio nal cost-efficiency is possible through the emerging tools of expert tele-consultation and home monitoring/ care coordination. Many telehealth clinical tools were initially developed to support acute illness care; telehealth expansion within Indian Health Se rvice specifically targets chronic care and a comprehensive approach to integrated specia lty service delivery. Clinical problems and chronic conditions targeted for enhanced service delivery include diabetes care, cardiovascular care, and mental health care. Ongoing federal invest ments in telehealth include items such as the Alaska Federa l Health Care Access Network (AFHCAN) enterprise telemedicine solution and the IHS Joslin Vision Network program. The telehealth program closely integrates its planning, implementation, and evaluation activities with three of the Agency's health initiatives on chronic ca re, behavioral health, and health promotion/disease prevention. Finally, IHS strives to improve its HIT infrastructure to su pport Presidential, Secretarial and IHS goals and priorities. This infrastruc ture is fundamental to HIT and health care operations. The current emphasis on health information technology emphasizes the use of a certified electronic health record in a meaningful way. Indian Health Service is committed to meeting this charge, recognizing that HIT holds the potential for improved clinical quality and safety and health information interoperability for all citizens. The RPMS Program underwent a program assessment in 2003. The assessment cited progress in achieving the majority of long-term performance goals and a clear commitment to provide accurate, timely, and comprehensive information to IHS providers and program managers as strong attributes of the program. The RPMS program continues to take actions to develop the capability to track how system improvements impact health outcomes, to deve lop budget requests that are explicitly tied to the accomplishment of annual and long- term performance goals and to analyze alternatives to provide a valid cost accounting link to health outcomes. CJ-76 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) - Health Information Technology (HIT) Recovery Act funds enable IHS to modernize and extend its electronic health care information tools, improving access, quality, safe ty and overall health status of American Indian/Alaska Native patients and populations. Approximately 60% of the funds will be obligated in FY 2009 and 40% in FY 2010. Approximately 95% of Recovery Act funde d activities will be carried out through existing or new commercial contracts. IHS will use up to 5% of the funds for administrative costs, project management, a nd Recovery Act transparency reporting. New competition: o Approximately 20% will be used for new hardware acquisitions for the purpose of infrastructure modernization relating to security, networking, communications, and health information technology. Thes e purchases will be completed through new contracts competed among vendor s offering products that meet the government's requirements. In addition, acquisitions for software development and related services will be awarded via appropriate co ntract vehicles and through existing Tribal contracts as appropriate. o In addition, approximately 25% will be used for a number of new acquisitions anticipated for software development a nd related services including requirements identification and management, design, deve lopment, testing, quality assurance, release management, and deployment. These new acquisitions will also be awarded via appropriate government contract vehicles, as well as through existing Tribal contracts as appropriate. Supplements to former competition: The remaining 50% will be awarded through several existing GSA contracts that will be accelerated to expedite Recovery Act funded activities for the EHR. The IHS ha s several existing GSA-awarded contract vehicles that will be accele rated to accommodate the im mediate opportunity afforded by the ARRA funding; this will enable us to rapidly expand our act ivities in the near term, addressing known requirements that were previously unfunded. Existing contracts will be used wherever the proposed work is consistent with the original contract scope; the vendors are prepared to add staff as necessary to meet the government's need. Objectives -- Consistent with the intent of ARRA and the HITECH portion of the Act, as well as with its own mission, IHS has identi fied activities to improve access, quality, safety, and overall health status of Am erican Indian/Alaska Native patients and populations. These include: Meaningful use of a qualified Electronic Health Record - o Comprehensive Health Information - Improving capabilities across the RPMS suite, such as clinical care, support se rvices, and practice management, including CJ-77 activities to increase the ease of implementation, support, and usability of the system. o Provider Order Entry - Continued improveme nts to applications that support the communication of orders and consultati ons, including electronic prescribing, among members of the health care team both on-site and remotely. o Clinical Decision Support - Creating and ac quiring clinical decision support tools that build additional intelligence in to RPMS, supporting quality of care and patient safety. o Quality and Performance Reporting - Expanding existing quality and performance reporting capabilities and ensu ring that quality and performance data are transparent and accessible to cons umers of IHS health care services. o Health Information Exchange - Activities to ensure that RPMS meets national interoperability standards and that facilities using RPMS are positioned to participate in exchanges such as the Nationwide Health Information Network. o Certification - Ensuring that RPMS receive s national certification as a qualified EHR for inpatient use and for behavior al health settings and continued certification as an outpatient EHR solution. o Deployment - Intensive support for the de ployment of RPMS EHR in all Federal and Tribal inpatient facilities and optim ization of implementation in outpatient settings as well. Personal Health Record Adoption - Developm ent and collaborations to create truly consumer-oriented tools for management and portability of personal health information. Telehealth and Network Infrastructure - Increasing the capability of the IHS technology infrastructure to support a broad range of new telehealth initiatives. This investment in health information technology within IHS will directly benefit the economy through the expenditure of funds in th e private sector for goods and services. Planned activities will contri bute to the revitalization of the American economy because these activities will require a significant expans ion in the use of IT service companies and will also support substantial acquisition of hardware from U.S. based information technology companies.

The vast majority is from the Hospital & Health Clinics budget line with a s mall amount from Direct Operations fo r federal personnel and travel. CJ-78 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2010 budget request for Information Technology under Hospitals and Health Clinics is $130,757,000, an in crease of $16,251,000 over the FY 2009 Omnibus level. IHS has information technology professionals working throughout the U.S. in clinics, hospitals, Area Offices, and two Headquarters locations. The conso lidation of the HHS investment resulted in a detailed data call throughout IHS facilities. The increase in the OMB A-11 exhibit 300 for the IHS Infrastructu re investment from FY 2009 to FY 2010 reflects the additional personnel, and their salaries, identified during this process and is a more accurate picture of what is spent in HIT. IHS' HIT solution (RPMS - Resource and Pa tient Management System) continues to expand to meet additional reporting requireme nts and provide increased but essential HIT services to patients, providers and communitie s. Traditionally, HIT is funded primarily from the Hospital and Health Clinics budget. Increasing clinical needs have led to increased spending on HIT to ensure comp liance with federal mandates, increased security needs, improved infrastructure, as well as ongoing and enhanced development and deployment of the electr onic health record in over 200 sites. These increases are currently funded from direct clinical care funds. The curre nt budget request ensures that these budget needs are independent of direct clinical care funds. The current IT budget request supports the functionality, interoperability and evolution of the IHS health IT system.

CJ-79DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Indian Health Service Services: 75-0390-0-1-551 DENTAL HEALTH FY 2008 FY 2009 ActPres. .......................................25 U.S.C. 13, Snyder Act, P.L. 83-568, Transfer Act 42 U.S.C. 2001 FY 2010 Authorization 2000 Allocation Method .................. Federal; P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts, Grants, and Self-Governance Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Dental Program has been in existence since the inception of the IHS in 1955. The Dental Program raises the oral health st atus of the American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) population to the highest possibl e level through the provision of quality preventive and treatment services at both th e community and clinic levels. The Dental Program is oriented toward preventive and ba sic care and over 90 pe rcent of the dental services provided are basic and emergency car e. More complex reha bilitative care (i.e., root canals, crown and bridge , dentures and surgical ex tractions) are provided where resources allow. The demand for dental treatment remains high due to the high dental caries rate in the AI/AN children; however, a continuing emphasis on community oral health promotion/disease prevention is essent ial to long-term improvement of the oral health of AI/AN people. The dental program maintains data and track ing of the three Government Performance and Results Act key program objectives - dental sealant, dental access, and topical fluorides. During the most recently comple ted Government Performance and Result Act (GPRA) data collection period, the dental program met the access to care target, exceeded the topical fluoride objective by 12 percent, and narrowly missed meeting the sealant objective by 1.7 percent. In FY 2008, the dental program utilized fiel d dental programs in conjunction with the Dental Clinical and Preventive Support Ce nters to achieve the program performance targets. The target for the topical fluori de measure was surpassed, resulting in a 12% increase in the number of topical fluoride applications over the previ ous fiscal year. The Dental access to care target was met, with 25% of the patient population receiving dental services. The dental sealant objective met 98% of its target. The dental program has CJ-80reported that most patients in the age cohorts targeted for sealants have already have had sealants placed on their teeth and that there are fewer new pa tients eligible for sealants each year. As a result, targets based on historical performance may continue to be difficult to achieve for this measure. The collaborative efforts between the field dental programs and the Dental Clinical and Prev entive Support Centers have resulted an increase in the number of topical fluorides applications, meeting the target for dental access, and a decrease in the number of teeth eligible for dental sealants. The Dental Clinical and Preventive Support Centers were designed and implemented in FY 2000 to help augment the dental public health infrastruc ture necessary to best meet the oral health need of the AI/AN community. The primary purpose of a Dental Clinical and Preventive Support Center is to provide technical suppor t, training, and assistance in clinical and preventive aspects of dental programs provi ding care to the AI/AN community. Each of the support centers approaches th e target based on the assessed needs of their Area but all strive towards providing the technical suppor t, training and assistance needed for the improvement of access of care and quality of care provided to the AI/AN population. The current support centers continue to deve lop and implement the unique and innovative programs to address the needs of the AI/AN community. The FY 2008 activities of the Support Center include but not limited to: Coordinated the dental referral and recal l appointments for expectant mothers, caregivers, infants and preschoolers. Increased Tribal infrastructure to deli ver community-based primary prevention and oral health education programs. Conducted ongoing oral health assessments in Tribal communities where prevention programs are in place. Conducted fluoridation advocacy for area comm unities that do not have fluoridated water. Increased access through part nership with public/private organization to provide dental care.

One of th e challenges that the program will face is that many adolescents already experience a high er prevalence of dental sealants, making it increasingly difficult to maintain current levels of sealant placement production. This CJ-81represents a significant victory for IHS Dental Program, as greater percentages of eligible tooth surfaces have been prot ected by dental sealants.

Faced with an on-goi ng critical vacancy rate, the program plans continued targeting of high-risk patients a nd collaborative efforts w ithin and outside of IHS as strategies to meet am bitious targets set forth in FY 2010. The specific examples of the utilization of the s upport centers to achieve the goa ls for FY 2010 included but not limited to: Provide biannual comprehensive dental program reviews, with emphasis on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the dental programs to each of the eight IHS and tribal dental programs in the Billings Area. Increase access to dental care to Diabetic patients in the Phoenix Area by establishing two periodontal treatment programs for diabetics. CJ-82 Provide training and technical assistance in sealant applicat ion to at least two staff members at 18 dental clinic s in the Aberdeen Area. Maintain the original 5 pilot sites of Healthy Start Programs currently using Xylitol gum in their classrooms in the Aberdeen Area. Plans to increase Xylitol gum programs to all sites in the Aberdeen Area . Maintaining the 43 (out of 55) fluoridated community water systems in the Aberdeen Area. Conduct fluoridated advocacy for communities who do not have fluoridated water in the Oklahoma Area. Increase access through partnership with th e public/private orga nization to provide care in a mobile dental c linic in the Oklahoma Area. Provide programs about the effect of tobacco on the oral health. The IHS expects to continue the implementa tion of the Electronic Dental Record (EDR) in FY 2009 to: Increase patient safety Reduce medical/dental errors Increase patient visits through improved scheduling and diagnostic capabilities.

Direct Federal; P.L. 93-638 Self-Determinati on compacts and contracts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS In partnership with American Indian and Alaska Natives (AI/AN), the purpose of the Mental Health/Social Service (MH/SS) program is to raise their physical, mental, social and spiritual health to the highest possi ble level. We strive to support AI/AN communities in eliminating behavioral health diseases and conditions by: 1) maximizing positive behavioral health and resiliency in individuals, families and communities; 2) improving the overall health care of AI/AN; 3) reducing the prevalence and incidence of behavioral health diseases; 4) supporti ng the efforts of AI/ AN communities toward achieving excellence in holistic behavioral health treatment, rehabilitation, and prevention services for individuals and thei r families; 5) advocating for and supporting Tribal behavioral treatment and prevention efforts; 6) promoting the capacity for self- determination and self-govern ance; and 7) advocating for AI/AN and service providers by actively participating in professional, regulatory, educatio nal, and community organizations at the National, St ate, Urban and Tribal levels. The MH/SS program is a community-oriented clinical and preventive mental health service program that provides primarily outpa tient mental health and related services, crisis triage, case management, preventi on programming, and outreach services. The MH/SS program provides general executive dire ction and recruitment of MH/SS program staff to 12 Area Offices (regi onal) that, in turn, provide resource distribution, program monitoring and evaluation activ ities, and technical support to 163 Service Units. These Service Units consist of IHS and Tribal programs whose MH/SS staffs are responsible for the delivery of comprehensive mental hea lth care to over 1.9 million AI/AN. Mental Health is crucial for the well- being of AI/AN communities. The most common MH/SS program model is an acute, crisis-oriented outpatient service CJ-85staffed by one or more mental health profession als. Over half of the federally recognized Tribes have administrative control over and deli very of the majority of mental health and substance abuse programs through tribal cont racts and compacts. Such local programs are community based and have direct knowledge of their pop ulation and what interventions can be effectively implemen ted. Many of the IHS, Tribal and Urban (I/T/U) mental health programs that provide services in times of crises do not have enough staff to operate 24/7. Therefore, when an emergency occurs, the clinic and service units will often have to contract out to non-IHS hospitals and crisis centers. Inpatient services are often purchased from non-IHS hospitals or provided by State or County mental health hospitals. Medical and clini cal social work ar e usually provided by one or more social workers who assist w ith discharge planning and provide family intervention for child abuse, suicide, domes tic violence, parenting skills, and marital counseling. IHS has developed a suicide surv eillance reporting tool to do cument incidents of suicide in a standardized and systematic fashion. The suicide surveillance tool captures data related to a specific incident of suicide, such as date and location of act, method, contributing factors, and other useful epid emiological information. Local and national reports can be sorted by a number of different variables including the number of suicide events by sex, age, community, tribe, and ot hers. The suicide surveillance measure has evolved from the FY 2004 target of deploying a suicide reporting form into the behavioral health package to integrating the form into th e Resource Patient Management System (RPMS) in FY 2005 to setting a base line level of use in FY 2006. The FY 2008 target for the use of the suicide surveillance fo rm was not met. The target was to increase the completion of suicidal behavior repor ting forms from 1,674 in FY 2007 to 1,758 in FY 2008. The number of forms completed dropped to 1,598. While the Behavioral Health-Management Information System wa s deployed widely in FY 2007, there were few additional sites added in FY 2008. Moreover, because this measure tracks forms completed, it is difficult to tell whether a de crease reflects lower usage of a form, or fewer events to record. The FY 2008 target was increased based on the FY 2007 performance results; however, targets for this measure are difficult to set, as it is also contingent on broader trends within AI /AN communities. In addition, the suicide surveillance form is currently underutilized by medical and be havioral health providers. To increase the utilization of the suicide su rveillance reporting form, IHS will increase and improve awareness of the form and the importance of suicide surveillance activities among providers, facility and Area managers, an d administrators. Similarly, RPMS Site Managers and Electronic Health Record (EHR) Clinical App lication Coordinators (CAC) must also be aware of the suicide surv eillance reporting form component and the appropriate application set-up and exporting processes. The FY 2009 target is to increase 5 percent over the FY 2008 result to 1,678 forms completed. IHS has been assessing the depression screen ing rate since FY 2006, when a baseline rate of 15 percent was established. In FY 2004 and FY 2005, the measure tracked the number of programs reporting certain be havioral health-related data . In FY 2007 the target for this measure was exceeded by 9 percentage points. In FY 2008 the targets for this measure were met and exceeded. In FY 2008, 35 percent of patients age 18 and older were screened for depression, an increase of 11 percentage po ints over the FY 2007 CJ-86rate of 24 percent. This measure has seen significant increases in results from the baseline result of 15 percent in FY 2006. Higher screening rates reflect increasing provider awareness of the impor tance of universal screening for depression among adults. The FY 2009 target is to mainta in the screening rate at the FY 2008 results of 35 percent. The FY 2010 target is to increase the screeni ng rate to 44 percent. This is a lower-cost screening measure with potential high retu rn on investment. Depression is often an underlying component contributi ng to suicide, accidents, domestic/intimate partner violence, and alcohol and substance abuse. Early identification of depression will contribute to reducing their inci dence, as well as allow providers to plan interventions and treatment to improve the mental hea lth and well-being of AI/AN people who experience depression. Director's Behavioral Health Initiative : Behavioral Health is an integral part in the treatment and prevention of diseases. Ma ny health conditions are linked to life-long behavior patterns, and therefore can be prevented by a change in lifestyle. By focusing on effective behavioral health techniques and integrating Trib al traditions and customs, we can bring proven behavioral health stra tegies and specific health promotion and disease prevention programs to AI/AN communities. Significant disparities exist within the AI/AN communities that can lead to behavi oral health problems. Issues such as substance abuse, domestic violence, forced cultural change, educa tion, poverty, lack of economic opportunity, and isolation can lead to physical and psychological problems. The objective of the Director's Behavioral H ealth Initiative is to improve the physical, mental, social, and spiritual well-being of AI/AN people by implementing strategies that will integrate and adapt various types of be havioral health techniques on a Federal, Urban and Tribal level, by focusing on the following areas: Methamphetamine Abuse Reduction : Methamphetamine use in Indian country can be described in a single word: \"Crisis.\" It is a crisis for individuals, families, communities, agencies and tribal governments. Most of the services for methamphetamine prevention programs are at the Tribal community level. The IHS is supporting Tribal programs through funding, national networking, training, and educational services. In the IHS sy stem, clinical services are provided. Suicide Prevention : The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that from 1999-2004, the suicide rate for American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN) was 10.84 per 100,000, higher than the ov erall US rate of 10.75. Su icide clustering is also a phenomenon known to occur in Indian countr y, affecting entire communities. Most of the suicide prevention programs are at th e Tribal community level. The Division of Behavioral Health focuses efforts in th e areas of emergency preparedness, training, national networking and educational services. Child/Family Protection : Domestic violence affects all communities, but AI/AN women and children are partic ularly vulnerable to abus e: In 2003, AI/AN children had the highest rate of vic timization; 21.3 children per 1000 (National Data Analysis System, Child Abuse and Neglect, January 2006) and 1 in 3 AI/AN women will be physical/sexually abused in their lifetime (Department of Justice, Findings From the National Violence Against Women Survey, November 2000). To help victims of CJ-87 BH Management Information System (MIS) : Used to prov ide direct clinical services, as well as sharing patient care doc uments and electronic charts across wide geographic areas in real-time (in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations). In 2006, a GPRA indicator for Depression Screening was implemented in order to scre en for depression, poten tial suicide risk and suicide clustering, providing clinic ians with more accurate data and documentation tools in order to devel op a comprehensive treatment plan and intervention. Wellness: Several area offices have been focu sing on the promotion of wellness and the treatment and prevention of chronic diseases through creative and alternative treatments that are culturally competent. Current and Recent Activities IHS has several programs that target suicide, such as: A. The IHS National Suicide Prevention Initiative -- The Director established the Suicide Prevention Initiative which is directly relate d to the Health and Human Services (HHS) National Strategy for Suicide Prevention and includes the following activities: IHS established the Suicide Prevention Committee (SPC), which provides recommendations and guidance to the Indian health system regarding suicide prevention, intervention and post-prevention in Indian Country. Membership of the SPC is interdisciplinary and represents a broad ge ographic distribution within and outside the Indian health system. In December 2008, th e SPC submitted the \"5-Year Indian Health System Suicide Prevention Strategic Plan.\" The IHS Community Suicide Prevention we bsite provides AI/AN communities with culturally appropriate information about be st/promising suicide prevention and early intervention programs and training opportunitie s. Further information and resources can be found at the following address: http://www.ihs.gov/NonMedicalPrograms/nspn/ A Memorandum of Understanding between Health Canada and the United States Department of Health and Human Services was signed to raise the health status of First Nations people in Canada and American Indians/Alaska Natives in the U.S. An Ad Hoc Working Group on Suicide Prevention was esta blished to share knowledge. As part of this work, the Honouring Life Network, which is a project of the National Aboriginal Health Organization, developed a website that offers culturally relevant information and resources on suicide prevention for Aborigin al people in Canada. Further information and resources can be found at the following address: http://www.honouringlife.ca/ Tele-behavioral health technology is incr easingly adopted to improve access to behavioral health services. Currently, over 30 IHS and Trib al facilities in 8 IHS Areas are augmenting on-site behavioral health serv ices with tele-behavioral health services. CJ-88This type of system capacity building supports not only distance psyc hiatric services to remote communities where such services are not available now but can also be used to share resources more efficiently in urban and semi-urban areas. IHS supports changing the paradigm of mental health services from being specialty and disease focused to being a part of primary care and the \"Medical Home.\" This offers new opportunities for interventions th at identify high-risk individuals before their actions or behavior becomes more clinical ly significant. Such interventions offer the promise of reducing traumatic experiences and losses dramatically in AI/AN communities. One primary care based behavioral health inte rvention is the Alcohol Screening Brief Intervention, which our agency is broadly promo ting as an integral part of a primary care based behavioral health program. Th e agency, through our Chronic Disease Collaborative and Innovations in Primary Care project, is also supporting efforts to integrate behavioral health providers directly into primary care settings. B. The Emergency Medical Serv ices/Preparedness Division -- The IHS Emergency Medical Services/Preparedness Division is supporting AI/AN communities by utilizing the IHS Emergency Response to Suicide Model to assess communities with high incidence of suicide, coordi nate a response to the aff ected community, and augment existing staff, with the goal of mitigating the emergency and stabilizing the community. For example, in FY 2008, the IHS Emergenc y Services staff on behalf of HHS and Intergovernmental Affairs managed the depl oyment of Public Hea lth Service mental health clinicians th rough the Office of Force Readine ss and Deployment (OFRD) to one Tribal community from January - May 2008 to respond to a suicide \"cluster\" in that community. C. Inter-Agency and Other Collaborations -- IHS collaborates with Tribes and Tribal organizations, Urban Indian programs, Fede ral (e.g., SAMHSA, CDC, NIMH), State, and local agencies, as well as public and priv ate organizations (e.g. Suicide Prevention Resource Center, National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) to formulate long term strategic approaches to address the issu e of suicide in Indian Country more effectively. Some of these collaborations included: the Joint IHS & SAMHSA National Behavioral Health Conference which provided training on a variety of behavioral health topics, including co-occurring disorders, methamphetamine and suicide prevention/intervention training. The 2008 Conference was held in Billings, Mont ana in August. There was an expansion of the collaboration efforts last year with the inclusion of the Bure au of Indian Affairs and Department of Justice, Housing and Ur ban Development. These Federal partners convened a Tribal Justice, Safety and Wellness Conferen ce, with the IHS/SAMHSA conference included within. There was an es timated participation of over 600 trainees. The 2009 Conference is scheduled to be held in August 2009 in the Minneapolis, Minnesota area. We have been working in collaboration with the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-SUICIDE crises lin e) and the Suicide Prevention Resource Center to develop and disseminate culturally appropriate information and resources for suicide prevention in Indian Country, both of which are funded by SAMHSA. The IHS established a National Behavioral Health Workgroup in 2007; and established the National Tribal Advisory Committee on Beha vioral Health in 2008. Through an Intra- Agency Agreement, the IHS and the Admini stration for Children and Families (ACF) CJ-89have collaborated in the planning, devel opment and administration of an expanded training project that wi ll provide five regiona l training sessions for I/T/U mental health and service providers who work in the area of child abuse and neglect (CAAN). The IHS and ACF have a long history of collaborati on on this project to provide this needed training. This year's training will be expande d to include technical assistance to mental health and service providers who serve AI /AN children who have experienced physical, sexual abuse and related trauma. D. Resource Patient Management System (RPMS) -- IHS has made substantial efforts over the last several years to improve the doc umentation of behavioral health services by enhancing behavioral health functionality in the Agency's health information system, Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS). Behavioral health information is integrated with primary care and other clin ical information suppor ting coordinated care and improved health outcomes. IHS is developing an IHS-wide Behavioral H ealth \"data mart\" to provide IHS up-to-date information on suicidal ev ents including suicid e completions. The application will include a number of availabl e reports and will provide the ability to identify \"cluster\" events to assist in th e mobilization and deployment of available resources. IHS has developed a suicide surv eillance reporting tool to do cument incidents of suicide in a standardized and systematic fashion. This tool is part of the RPMS health information system and is available to all providers. The Suicide Reporting Database is beginning to provide a more detailed picture of who is committing or attempting suicide and identifies salient factors contributing to the events. Accurate and timely data captured at the point of care provides importa nt clinical and epidemiological information that can be used to inform intervention and prevention efforts. IHS GPRA measures now include screening fo r depression of adults ages 18 and over in primary care settings as best prac tice in order to assist in id entifying patients at risk for developing suicidal ideation. Tools have been selected to assess depression, monitor response, track such response over time, and are incorporated into the IHS Electronic Health Record. IHS has consistently met or exceeded target goals for this GPRA depression screening measure. The system is now deployed and in operation in over 250 clinical sites across the c ountry. Depression screening improves detection, referral, and treatment of mental health needs.

The increased target for FY 2010 is based on the assumption that increased use of the reporting form will result in an increased number of forms completed. Completion of forms should provide more co mplete information about the incidence of suicidal ideation and attempts as well as completions, which will provide far more accurate data to national policy makers and wi ll allow interventions to be evaluated for effectiveness in ways no t previously possible.

Direct Federal; P.L. 93-638 Self-Determinati on contracts and compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS The purpose of the Indian Health Service (IHS) Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) is to raise the behavioral health status of American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) to the highest possible level through the provision of preven tive and treatment services at both the community and clinic levels. These programs provide alcohol and substance abuse treatment and prevention services within rural and urban communities, with a focus on holistic and culturally-based appr oaches. The ASAP exists as part of an integrated behavioral health team that work s collaboratively to re duce the incidence of alcoholism and other drug dependencies in AI/AN communities. Approximately 5 percent of the employees in IHS-funded ASAP are Federal staff with Tribal and Urban staff comprising 95 percent. The reported ce rtified counselor and professional licensure rates continue at 85 percent. Two ways in which the ASAP measures its ability to raise the behavioral health status of AI/AN are by ensuring that Youth Residential Treatment Centers (YRTC) are licensed and/or accred ited and that mothers to-be receive the appropriate screenings for Fetal Al cohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). The 12 youth residential treatment centers (YRTCs) provide substance abuse and co- occurring mental health treatment services to AI/ANs. Presently there are 11 operating YRTCs and 1 adult treatment center. Congress authorized th e construction of YRTCs in each IHS Area but some Tribes have elected to run their own programs. Some IHS areas such as Alaska and Navajo, divide their f unds to provide residential services for two programs. The YRTCs that are congressionally authorized for the California Area IHS are in the implementation stage, e.g., land pur chase, building constr uction, with program justification documents approved by IHS Headquarters. CJ-93Past trending results for this program show consistent achievement of a 100 percent accreditation rate for YRTCs in operation 18 months or longer. In FY 2007 and FY 2008, this measure was not met since one f acility was not accredited resulting in an accreditation rate of 91 percent. This facili ty continues to work toward the goal of accreditation by State certification, Jo int Commission or the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). The anticipated timeframe is estimated to be within twelve months. In FY 2009, the target is to assist all YRTCs in their goal of achieving and maintaining the 100 percent accreditation rate. Reasons for Performance Result: One facili ty failed accreditation in FY 2008, which resulted in a 91 percent accreditation rate for the YRTCs. IHS continues to collaborate with programs regarding li censure and accreditation issues. Strong recommendations to continue with th e accreditation process, including State certification, are always a top priority within the program. Steps Being Taken to Better Match Targ ets with Program Performance: The FY 2009 and 2010 targets for this measure are to reach a 100 percent accreditation rate. Impact of Results: These programs provide alcohol and substance abuse treatment and prevention services within rural and urban communities, with a focus on holistic and culturally-based approaches. The program exists as part of an integrated behavioral health team that works colla boratively to reduc e the incidence of alcoholism and other drug dependencies in AI/AN communities. In addition to the RTCs, many of the a pproximately 300 Tribal and Urban alcohol programs are State-licensed/certified and/or accredited. There are more than a dozen Tribally-operated AI/AN alcohol and substance abuse adult re sidential treatment centers, including two serving pregnant women and/or women with children.

Methamphetamine use and abuse is one of the most important health issues for Tribes, according to both formal and informal Tribal consultation. CJ-94The suicide prevention initiative is directly related to the Health and Human Services national strategy for suicide pr evention, to transform the h ealth care system by supporting community-based approaches to closing the healthcare gap, particul arly among racial and ethnic minority populations. This initiative also addresses th e IHS Director's Behavioral Health Initiative. In FY 2008, the IHS received $14 million to tackle methamphetamine use and abuse as well as suicide, two very seri ous issues affecting Indian country. In the spring of 2008, the IHS National Tribal Advisory Committee on Behavioral Health (NTAC) was formed. This committee is made up of an elected Tr ibal leader from each of the twelve IHS Areas. The NTAC is charged with advising the IHS on how to spend these funds in the best interests of AI/AN communities. As part of these efforts, expanding access to behavioral health serv ices in a variety of settings remains an important goal. In pa rticular, this includes access to specialty services such as psychiatry and psychology wh ere continued service gaps remain in many locations. Tele-Behavioral Health (TBH) or tele-videoconferencing is a technical tool that helps address chronic service gaps. In addition to supporting computerized provider order entry and documentation, this technology provides a basic structural support for providing services across large areas without any loss of effi ciency. The technology is currently focused on psychiatric support, but it is read ily adaptable to pr ovide a variety of clinical and clinical suppor t services from counseling and assessments to clinical supervision to virtual group therapy opportunities. TBH activities in FY 2008 included the following: Identified the scope and extent of TB H implementation partly through a formal assessment of selected programs to establ ish best practices slated for Fall of 2008 (20+ active programs varying in size from several hours per month to a primary care site to complex programs serving multiple sites); Clarified and established TBH data sets incl uding a retrospective review of use from 2003 through 2007 that suggests a marked ramp -up in service provision (24 contacts in 2003 to 1659 contacts in 2007); Proposed a TBH clinic code to improve trac king in the future that has since been approved and was implemented as of June, 2008; Reviewed existing MIS processes and iden tifying changes needed to support TBH implementation; Modeled potential funding models to improve scalability of TBH services including potential regionalization; Promoted the use and integration of TB H technologies in a number of venues including the national IHS/SAMHSA conference in August 2008, a nationally broadcast IHS-Director sponsored telehea lth presentation, the IHS Combined Council Meeting in February 2008, and through meetin gs and teleconferences with interested CJ-95entities including area and service unit programs, tribal programs, the VA, state agencies and for-profit/non- for-profit corporations; Negotiated funding policy changes with stat es resulting in significant improvements in potential TBH funding s upport in at least one state (Arizona); and Established a national level project manager for TBH services. Ongoing behavioral health data systems and software development are program priorities for IHS which include the widely deploye d Behavioral Health System v3.0. The Behavioral Health Graphical User Interface (GUI) focuses on the Data Entry module of BHS v3.0 with the goal of facilitating direct pr ovider entry of clinical data, including alcohol screenings. Data collection, management, trai ning, and improvement efforts include expansion of the beha vioral health management information system to I/T/U facilities to increase and improve alcohol screenings. Two in tegrated behavioral health clinical documentation and data platforms have been deployed. There are currently over 340 clinics and Tribal programs reporting to the IHS National Database using one of these platforms. Efforts are underway to integrate these platforms with the IHS Electronic Health Record. This allows access to the development of clinical reminders as well as more sophisticated case and population ma nagement tools such as iCare. It will promote interchange of information between primary care and behavioral health settings. Even with the focused activ ities undertaken in FY 2008, significant disparities among AI/AN (relative to the general population) ex ist across the spectrum of substance abuse problems. The AI/AN drug-related death rate is 18 percent higher than the rate for the overall U.S. population. Among youths aged 12 to 17, the rate of current illicit drug use was highest among AI/ANs (23.0 percen t for combined 2000 and 2001 data).

This increase represents $2,820,000 for Tribal and Federal pay increases; $25,000 for non-medical inflation at 1.0 percent and $4,748,000 for medical inflat ion at 3.0 percent; $2,757,000 for population growth at 1.5 percent; and $290,000 for program increases for 2 new Tribes, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and the Tuscarora Tribe under the Nashville Area Office. The FY 2008 alcohol screening (to preven t Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders) performance target was to maintain the FY 2007 target of 41 percent. However, the CJ-96 actual rate was 47 percent. The FY 2009 al cohol screening (to pr event Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) performance target is to maintain the rate at 47 percent. With the FY 2010 requested funding, the program anticipates increasing this screening rate to 50 percent; the performance target for the accreditation of YRTCs will be maintained at 100 percent after it is restored to this level in 2009.

Direct Federal, '638 Contracts and Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Indian Health Service (IHS) Contract Health Services (CHS) program originated under the Department of Interior, Bureau of I ndian Affairs, when authority to enter into health services contracts for American Indian and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) was provided under the Johnson O'Malley Act of 1934. In 1955, it was transferred to the Department of Health, Educa tion, and Welfare. The CHS program supplements and complement s direct care and other health care resources available to eligible AI/ANs. CHS payments are made to community heal thcare providers in situations where: There is a designated service ar ea where no IHS or Tribal dir ect care facility exists; The direct care facility does not provide the required health care services; The direct care facility has more demand fo r services than it has capacity to provide; and/or The patient must be taken to the ne arest Emergency Services facility The CHS budget supports the purchase of essent ial healthcare services from community healthcare providers that include, but are not limited to, inpatient and outpatient care, routine and emergency ambulatory care, medi cal support services including laboratory, pharmacy, nutrition, diagnostic imaging, and physical therapy. Additional services include treatment and services for diabetes, ca ncer, heart disease, in juries, mental health, domestic violence, maternal and child health, elder care, refractions, ultrasound examinations, dental hygiene, orthoped ic services, and transportation. CJ-99In FY 2008, the estimated number of one-way tr ips for patient and escort travel is over 40,000. In FY 2009, the estimated number of trips increases to 42,822 and in FY 2010 the estimated number of one-way trips is 44,114. The budget increases will allow IHS to fund a greater number of trips although the rising costs of both ground and air transportation continues to be a challenge b ecause many AI/ANs live in remote areas of the country. However, the unprecedented 23 percent increase in funding proposed for CHS will allow IHS to cover these costs and dramatically increase access to care to IHS beneficiaries In FY 2008, the estimated number of dental services provided through CHS is 65,700. In FY 2009, the estimated number of dental services increases to 69,763 and in FY 2010, the estimated number is 84,010. Again, rising co st of health care services, transportation, and demand for CHS play a critical role in th e number of services that the program can purchase. In addition, dental se rvices must meet the highest de ntal priority in order to be funded. The unprecedented 23 percent increase in funding proposed for CHS will allow IHS to cover dental services and dramatically increase access to care to IHS beneficiaries. The CHS funds are provided to the Area Offices, which in turn provide resource distribution, program monitoring and evalua tion activities, and technical support to 163 Federal and Tribal OUs (lo cal level), and health care f acilities providing care. In FY 2010, the funds will be distri buted based on the following: $374.1 million, or 48 percent, for fede rally operated facilities, and $405.2 million, or 52 percent, for tribally operated programs. The CHS budget also includes $48 million for the Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund (CHEF) that provides funding for high cost cas es and catastrophic events that affect IHS and Tribal CHS programs. The significant increase recommended in FY 2010 will allow IHS to provide additional critical services to AI/ANs. The table below demonstrates the type of high cost cases CHEF paid in FY 2008.

Most tribal facilities do not report their data. In FY 2007, the CHS program implemented Section 506 of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) that required Medica re participating hospitals to accept Medicare-like rates as payment in full. The MMA Medicare-lik e rates provision enable IHS, Tribes, and Urban health programs to pay full-billed Medi care-like rates for inpatient services and associated costs for hospitals that participate in Medicare programs. To assist the CHS program in maximizing it s annual resources th e program contracts with Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Mexico, as its fiscal intermediary (FI). The FI assists the Agency by ensuring CHS payments made are in acco rdance with the IHS payment policy. In addition, the FI focuses on quality of care and coordinates benefits with other payers to maximize the CHS dollar. The FI also calculates payment rates as set forth in negotiated provider contracts. An important and integral function of the FI is to provide management reports on the provision of services to th e AI/AN patient population and services from health care providers from the non-IHS community. These management reports are necessary to ensure the appropriateness of care and the use of CHS f unds to enhance the overall effectiveness and management of the CHS program. The FI monitors data, processes payments, provides workload, and financial da ta in support of the IHS statistical and financial CHS program needs. The IHS/CHS FI reports demons trate that the annual medical costs continue to increase while the level of services provide d annually is decreasing as follows: CJ-101Professional Care 300,000 320,000 340,000 360,000 * Data for FY 2005, 2006, & 2007 ar e based on annualized projections.

At the same time, billed costs per visit increased $160 or by 42 percent from $378 to $538. **Includes: Physician, Dental, Eye, Lab, Radiology and Other Professional Care services such as Ambulance, Cardiography, Pacemaker Analysis, Ventilation, Physical Therapy etc. Inpatient Admissions 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 From 2002 to 2007, CHS inpatient admissions declined by 9 percent from 14,468 to 13,152 At the same time, billed costs per admi ssion increased 63 percent from $14,283 to $23,282 CJ-102FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2005 $498,068,000 2006 $517,297,000 $543,099,000 2008 $579,334,000 FY 2009 Recovery $0 FY 2009 Omnibus $634,477,000 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2010 budget request for the CH S program is $779,347,000, an increase of $144,870,000 over the FY 2009 Omnibus level. This represents $26,888,000 for pay costs increases, inflation, populati on growth, and $117,982,000 for program increase CHS and CHEF, and funds for two new tribes. Current Services: Pay Cost: +$11,000 - will fund pay increases for seven (7) Tribal employees. One position is identified for the Klamath Falls Tribe and six (6) positions are for the Pascua Yaqui Tribe in accordance with the FY 2003 Interior Appropriations Conference Report (No.108-10) language. The language states, \"T he conference agreement also permits funds, provided to new tribes through the contract health services activity to be used for direct medical services in addition to c ontract care. The Service began funding new tribes from the contract health services account several years a go and it was never the intent of the House and Senate Committee on Appropriations to limit new tribes funding to contract health care only.\" The FY 2003 language does provide some flexibility to Tribes for funding of positions. Population Growth: +$9,517,000 - These funds will support additional services need resulting from the growing AI/AN population. A 1.5% growth rate is projected, based on State births and deaths data. Inflation Non-Medical: +$3,000 - These funds will address non-medical cost increases. Inflation Medical Care +$17,357,000 - These funds will address the increased cost of health care. Program Increases: Program Increase +$100,000,000 - This unprecedented increase for CHS will allow IHS to cover a significant number of CHS case s which may otherwise go uncovered. The increase will enable the CHS program to c over not only priority I cases, but may cover some priority II and preventive services. Because it is difficult to measure denials and deferred services, health care needs which vary greatly throughout Indian country the programs relies on the data it receives to do estimates CJ-103 and projections. In addition, Tribes operate 52 percent of the CHS budget and do not always report all their denial and deferred data. The c ontinued increased cost of health care plays a vital role in number of services that can be purchased from the non-IHS community. CHEF Increase +$17,000,000 - This increase will fund over 700 additional high cost cases that were not previously funded by the CHEF program, this increase will bring the total funding level for the CH EF to $48 million. The CHEF funds supplements the CHS program, by providing more resources for CHEF will alleviate the affects of high cost cases and enable CHS programs to provide more services at the lower priory levels. New Tribes +$982,000 - These funds will provide fundi ng that will integrate two new Tribes into the IHS system, the Mashp ee Wampanoag of Massachusetts and the Tuscarora of New York. The amount of CHS care in relation to direct care dollars and th e types of services purchased under CHS vary among IHS Areas; the table below shows provisional budget obligations, or commitments, by general category of CHS expenditure from FY 2005 through 2008, with estimated obligations fo r 2009 and 2010. The CHS outputs show the relative importance of four major categorie s provided annually. The change in IHS hospital replacements and emphasis on outpatient care has resulted in an increased reliance on CHS resources. Over the past 10 ye ars, the IHS has initiated the replacement of hospitals with more cost effective compre hensive health care cen ters requiring the IHS to purchase inpatient, emergency room serv ices and specialized care from outside sources. This trend reflects th e transition of the Indian hea lth care delivery from an acute care to a preventive and commun ity-based patient care. Through the following activities, CHS is working toward providing the highest level of health care to AI/ANs: Provide comprehensive support with em phasis on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of CHS programs th rough managed care initiatives. Provide National training and technical assistance for both IHS and Tribal CHS programs. Increase partnership with the IHS Busine ss Office to maximize and access all third party resources. Promote health education and prevention initiatives. Provide comprehensive healthcare services th at improve life exp ectancy and address chronic disease, morbidity and reduces the di sparity in health st atus of AI/ANs as compared to the general U.S. population. Negotiate contracts for the best possible rates. Adhere to the CHS regulations and the IHS medical pr iority system. CJ-104OUTPUT Measure FY 2008 Target FY 2010 Target FY 2010 +/- FY 2009 Gen.

These funds are necessary to provide community nursing programs focused with the goals of prom oting health and preventing disease and disability. The Public Health Nursing's health promotion and disease prevention focus is accomplished through primary preven tion, secondary prevention, and tertiary prevention focused health interventions towards individuals, families, and community groups as well as improving health status by early detection through screening and disease management. Primary prevention ta rgets healthy populations and activities are aimed at preventing the onset of di sease in high risk populations through education, health awareness, and risk reduction. Seconda ry prevention detects and treats problems in the early stages of illness or disease. These interventions target disease before complications arise and befo re signs or symptoms appear. Secondary prevention targets populations with common risk factors. Tertiary prevention reduces further complications from a disease or illn ess and restores the individual to their optimum level of health. Tertiary preventi on interventions occur after a disease or illness has developed. $17 million for Health Education reflects an increase of $959,000 over the FY 2009 Omnibus level. These funds are necessa ry to provide community health, school health, worksite health promotion, and patient education. The Health Education standardizes, coordinates and integrates education issues within the IHS including health literacy for clients, professional e ducation and training, as well as educational materials for staff, patients, families and communities. $62 million for Community Health Representatives reflects an increase of $3,832,000 over the FY 2009 Omnibus level. Th ese funds are necessary to bridge gaps between AI/AN persons and health ca re resources by integr ating basic medical CJ-106 knowledge about health promotion/dis ease prevention and local community knowledge in specially trained indigenous community members. $2 million for Immunization AK reflects an increase of $111,000 over the FY 2009 Omnibus level. These funds are necessary to provide vaccines for preventable diseases, vaccine performance, immunizat ion consultation/edu cation, research and liver disease prevention treatment and management as top health priorities. The Hepatitis B and Haemophilus Immunization Programs (Alaska) budget supports these priorities through direct pa tient care, surveillance and education AI/AN patients. Preventive Health services contribute widely to the performance measures that fall under the auspices of Hospitals & Health Clinics. Public Health Nursing provides community based clinical services which directly contribute to overall performance achievement activities such as immunizations, case management, and patient education. Community Health Representatives are also community based and integral in their contribution to follow up care and patient education. Health education activities permeate the Indian Health System and are in tegral to many of the screening measures. The Immunization Alaska program plays a key role by tracking immunization rates through specific immunization registries through out the state of Alaska, and such efforts contribute to the nationa l immunization rates.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Indian Health Service (IHS) Public He alth Nursing (PHN) is a public/community health nursing program that focuses on the goa l of promoting health and quality of life, and preventing disease and disabi lity in the community that is served. The PHN services were carried out by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the early 1910 - 1920's then were delegated to the IHS with the Transfer Act in 1955. The American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) population experiences disproportionate rates of diabetes mellitus, ca rdiovascular disease, obesity, suicide, and unintentional injuries. A program focus on h ealth promotion and disease prevention is accomplished through community-based primary, secondary and tertiary prevention services that are provided to individuals, families, and community groups. The Public Health Nurses are members of the multidisciplinary health care team and they provide continuity and coordination of healthcare which results in improved outcomes for the AI/AN population. Their work supports high quality, community-based, culturally appropriate care that reduces dispariti es in access and health outcomes. Services include: communicable disease - surveillance & mon itoring, immunizations; PHN case management; maternal and child health care - prenatal/postpartum case management and education, newborn/child e ducation, developmental screening, and case management of special needs children; chronic disease care and case management; health education and screenings for at-risk diseases or health concerns, and; school health screenings. To highlight the critical role PHNs pl ay in the community, USA Today, July 18, 2008 and Nursing Spectrum magazine, July 28, 2008 reported the \"Salmonella outbreak that CJ-108sickened nearly 1200 people nationwide has showcased the critical role of the public health nurses' job.\" An IHS public health nurse played a key role, with her keen assessment skills and quick identification of patterns of illness, which led to the discovery of the widespread problem. PHN programs focus on measurable clinical activities that address health disparities, and activities that support the IHS initiatives: Chronic Disease, Health Promotion/Disease Prevention (HP/DP), Behavioral Health and; the HHS Strategic Plan. The PHN outcome performance measure supports several elements of the IHS Strategic Plan - Goals 1 and 2: Build and Sustain Healthy Communities and; Provide Accessible and Quality Health Care - specifically, providing commun ity-based approaches that address the health gap in the AI/AN population. Forty-three percent of this budget request supports Tribal co mpacted and contracted PHN programs. Public Health Nurse contributions to the agency and department goals are funded through the distribution of program aw ards for IHS and Tribal PHN programs. There were 15 grants and program awards i ssued in FY 2008 that will continue through the FY 2009-2011 cycles. The grants emphasi ze Departmental and Agency goals of access to health care and disease prevention services. The FY 2008 through FY 2011 grant awards focus on improving health outcomes through primary, secondary and tertiary prevention activities and PHN case management services with the patient and family. The grant extension will enhance sustainability of services. In FY 2009, there has been an improvement in the Public Health Activities Database (PHAD) (formerly titled the CHAPS database ) which has the capability of capturing specific public health nursing services at th e local level. Training sessions have been implemented that targets data improvemen ts pertaining to documentation and coding practices. This training is in process and will continue through FY 2009. The coding and documentation training provides the skills to learn the data process and to analyze and troubleshoot local data issues. The PHAD data base is an Indian Health Performance Evaluation System. The PHAD database has the ability for the PHN programs to track performance related clin ical and quality improvement activities. Overall, the PHN program contributes toward s 10 agency performance measures; six are highlighted in the corresponding output tabl e: tobacco screening, domestic violence screening, depression screeni ng, follow-up, adult influenza vaccinations, and adult pneumococcal vaccinations. PHN home vi sit activities prioritize interventions that target the maternal and pediatric populat ion, including: childhood obesity prevention through breastfeeding promotion, screening fo r early identification of developmental problems, parenting education and chronic disease management. Community health individual and group activities include health education related to communicable disease prevention; chronic disease prevention; welln ess promotion; safety, such as, all-age seatbelt use, bicycle sa fety, home safety; health risk scr eenings for diabetes, cholesterol, and hypertension, and; providi ng school screenings that include immunizations and health assessments. Public Health Nurs e case management improves health outcomes and reduces hospitalizations. CJ-109 The performance goals require th at the PHN programs focus on: Evidence-based primary, secondary and tertiary prevention interventions . An overview of the prevention interventions are: o Primary prevention interventions that avert diseases from occurring, such as: immunizations; breastfeeding; health pr omotion/disease prevention education; building assets in youth, etc. o Secondary prevention interventions that detect and treat problems in their early stages, such as: health sc reening of high-risk populations; screening for diabetes and hypertension; fall risk assessmen ts; school health assessment, etc. o Tertiary prevention interventions that keep existing problems from getting worse, such as: chronic disease & home sel f-management; medication management; periodic home visit assessments that pr event limb amputations, blindness or renal failure; coordination of external home management resources, etc. Maintaining community-based PHN services to individuals, families and community groups. PHN competitive awards and grants that provide funding to program awardees to increase public health nursing primar y, secondary and tertiary prevention interventions that reduce morbidity and mortality in local communities through evidence based practice services. A major challenge faced by PHN programs is the increasing vacancy rates over the past five years. The vacancy rate in FY 2004 was 9 percent; FY 2005 was 20 percent; FY 2006 was 21 percent; FY 2007 was 22 percent and FY 2008 continues at a 22 percent vacancy rate and 4 percent staff turnover.

This increase represents $3,929,000 for pay increases, inflation, population growth and staffing new facilities and $257,000 for program increase for 2 new tribes. CJ-110The 2010 performance measure is an increase of 2,300 encounters over the 2009 target. This will be accomplished by improved data collection and decreased position vacancies as a result of: PHN documentation and coding training Development of standardized PHN docum entation templates and embedded codes Increased PHN program implementation of EHR documentation Reorganized recruitment strategies Funding for new tribes and new facilities/s taffing equates to a total of 17.5 FTEs, or approximately seven percent of the total PHN workforce. The impact on performance may not be as significant in FY 2010 given that 2.5 of these FTEs will be for new tribes that will need time to establish the programs and hire staff. The impact of increasing performance will result in more secondary and tertiary prevention services provided to AI/AN communities, improving early detection and prevention of the complications of chronic disease.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93-6 38 Self-Determination Contracts and Self-Governance Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Indian Health Service (IHS) Health Educ ation program has been in existence since 1955. The program continues to focus on the importance of educating our American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) clients in a manner that empowers them to make better choices in their lifestyles and how they utilize health services. The 22 IHS and approximately 75 tribal Health Educati on program staff partner with other IHS disciplines and programs to ensu re that the education of our clients continues to occur even at sites without a full-time health e ducator. The IHS can demonstrate a steady increase in the health and patient education encounters that are being provided to AI/AN clients by all providers within the IHS and by our Tribal partners. This model concept demonstrates not only the collaboration betw een the IHS Health Education Program and all IHS health disciplines and programs but also demonstrates an IHS-wide focus and commitment on education. As the Health Educ ation Output Table de monstrates, we have maintained a steady increase in the number of AI/AN clients that have participated in an educational encounter. The number of visits in which education was provided has moved from 777,000 visits with education provi ded in FY 2004 to 2,202,279 at the end of FY 2008 (183% increase). Clearly this dem onstrates the IHS commitment to improve health education access, increased hea lth literacy, increased patient-provider communications, and ultimately better health outcomes. The Health Education program maintains data tracking of two key program objectives - Tobacco Cessation and Cardiovascular disease (CVD) assessment. During the most recently completed Government Performance and Result Act (GPRA) data collection period, the Health Education program contri buted to increased performance from the 12 percent FY 2006 baseline to 21 percent in FY 2008 of the proportion of tobacco-using patients that receive tobacco cessation intervention; and increased the proportion of at- CJ-113risk patients who have a comprehensive asse ssment for all CVD-related risk factors to 30 percent. While not a GPRA indicator, the IHS Health Education maintains IHS-wide statistics on educational encounters. Examples of educat ional statistical enc ounters reveal: 1) the number of clients educated, 2) which pr oviders provided education, 3) where the education took place, 4) what information the patient was provided with, 5) the amount of time spent providing this education, 6) whet her the patient unde rstood the education provided, and 7) whether the patient set a beha vior goal change. These IHS statistics are currently available from the RPMS system. In partnership with all IHS programs, disciplines and staff, the H ealth Education Program staff continues to: (1) Communicate the importance and on-going n eed for comprehensive clinical and community health education services to AI/AN clients; (2) Provide these services both as individua l one-on-one counseling education sessions and in group encounters in the community; (3) Standardize, coordinates a nd integrates education issues within the IHS including health literacy for clients, professional e ducation and training, as well as educational materials for staff, patients, families and communities; and (4) Assist in transforming the Health Care Sy stem to increase access to high quality, effective health care that is predictably safe. The Health Education Program has iden tified the following areas of emphasis: Continue and strengthen th e development of standardiz ed, nationwide patient and health education program through the inte gration of the IHS Patient Education Protocols into all IHS software packages including the PCC, PCC+ and the Electronic Health Record; with the c ontinued provision of ongoing training to IHS and Tribal staff on the documentation and coding of patient and health education; This effort assists IHS to meet Healthy People 2010 Objectives to improve consumer access to health information and to improve h ealth communications to our clients. Increase a concentrated focus on the area of Healthy People 2010 : Health Communications: o Increase the proportion of AI/ANs wi th access to health information; o Improve the health literacy of AI/AN with inadequate or marginal literacy skills; o Increase the health information contained on www.ihs.gov ensuring that information disclosed is quality-assured and cultural appropriate for AI/AN clients; o Maintain support to the established Center of Excellence in Health Communications based at the IHS Clini cal Support Center, Phoenix, AZ to enhance the capacity of staff that provides educational services to AI/AN clients by providing standardized professional educ ation and training for staff and patient and family education in the clinical faci lities as well as in the community; and o Improve patient-provider communication skills.

This increase would support pay costs, population growth, inflation, staffing for new facilities, and 2 newly recognized tribes. This funding supports the provision of the existing services to a slightly expanded population of AI/AN people served and suppor ted by new facilities. This funding also supports two key program objectives - Tob acco Cessation and Cardiovascular disease (CVD) assessment both of which are target ed for performance increases in FY 2010. These two measures are critical for IHS in te rms of impacting health disparities afflicting the AI/AN population, particularly diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Health education continues to be an integral part of impacting the rates of these and other chronic diseases, not only in terms of reach ing a higher percentage of the population, but in educating each high risk pati ent about the risks of smoking, or ensuring that such high- risk patients receive the appropriate screeni ng to assist in monitoring the status of ischemic heart disease. IHS anticipates th at the CVD baseline will be maintained at 30 percent in FY 2009 but increased to 31 percent in FY 2010. Rates for tobacco cessation will also be maintained at 21 per cent in FY 2009 and increa se to 24 percent for FY 2010. Similarly, overall increases in Health Education patient encounters for FY 2010 will be increased by 5 percent over the FY 2009 level. These performance increases represent the IH S Health Education program's commitment to supporting the IHS Chronic Disease and HP/DP initiatives and will be achieved by improving efficiency in delivering and reporting these critical services.

FY 2010 Authorization ..................................................................................Expired 2000 Allocation Method ................Direct Federal, P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts and Self-Governance Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS Originally begun by the Office of Economic O pportunity in 1968, the Community Health Representatives (CHR) Program was transfer red to the IHS at a time when IHS was looking for ways to support the Tribes in self -determination through the provision of health care. Under the concept of utilizing comm unity members as health paraprofessionals to expand health services and initiate community change, CHRs serve tribal members and communities as charged by Congress to provide health care, health promotion and disease prevention services to Indian communities (Indian Health Care Improvement Act [IHCIA] as amended, Public Law 100-713, dated November 23, 1988). The IHCIA also mandated the Secretary to pr ovide a quality training program, including continuing education needs for CHRs. Funds are distributed to the Tribes through Area allocations. All but two of the 264 CHR programs are administered and operated by th e Tribes through contracts/compacts under the authority of the Indian Self-Determinati on and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA). Headquarters CHR shares are utilized primar ily for 1) training, 2) data/software development through the Resource Patient and Management System's (RPMS) CHR Patient Care Component (PCC) data application and 3) Speci al Projects in support of training and data software development. Training is a key tool when providing laypersons with the comprehensive health education needed to perform the wide variety of job responsibilitie s the various Tribes assign to their CHRs. Traini ng affords CHRs the skills needed to provide 16 categories of services that make a difference in th eir patients' lives and which contribute to performance measures under Hospitals and Health Clinics. CJ-117For FY 2008, direct Patient Care led in types of services provided by CHRs at nearly 20 percent; Case Finding/Screening nearly 17 percent; Case Management nearly 13 percent; Monitoring Patients over 12 percent; Health Education nearly 12 percent Transportation over 10 percent; and Other Patient Services nearly 8 percent (please see following chart): CHRs provide services to all eligible AI/AN patients as defined by 42 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), subpart A-G (1986). National CHR Program data shows that for the top 6 health problems for which CHRs provide services, primary beneficiaries in the AI/AN population are elders (p lease see chart and table be low, \"Top 6 Health Problem Codes by Age\"). \"Unknown\" typically refl ects patients who are not on the specific patient registry at the health facility serv ing the local population a nd thus their specific ages are unknown, yet CHRs provide services be cause they are eligible elsewhere or fall into another eligible category. CJ-118 CJ-119TOP 6 HEALTH PROBLEM CODE REPO RT WITH AGE - FY 2008 - PATIENT DATA ONLY Diabetes Hypertension Other HP/DP Heart Nutrition Dialysis Ages 0-9 do not total 100% because these represent only the top 6 health problems for which patients are seen, not for all health problems in the entire population served. Acquiring data in CHR PCC is challenged by underutilization of th e application, under- reporting and access issues to RPMS. Market ing the benefits of the application and focusing on training of CHRs on the proper use, data entry and export of CHR PCC data will support the HHS Strategic Plan in adva ncing the development and use of health information technology; contribut e to statistics which prove program effectiveness; and improve coordination and communication betwee n CHRs and clinicians regarding patient care. All the charts and data provided here are th e results of Tribes using RPMS CHR PCC. The numbers reported will increase as CHR Programs utilizing RPMS CHR PCC are added and as CHR Programs which currently use the software appl ication improve their data entry capability and/or ar e able to export their files to IHS Headquarters. A CHR Program performance target is to in crease service hours of Chronic Disease services for CVD, Diabetes and Cancer provided by CHRs to support clinical and community-based initiatives such as th e Health Promotion/Disease Prevention, Behavioral Health and Chronic Care Initiativ es. These measures impact access to health care services, expand consumer choices and pr omote healthy behaviors. \"High talk, low tech\" (the concept that service providers can sometimes utilize human interaction and supportive relationships with much greater effect and intensity than relying on technological resources with patients) pays dividends, as shown in recent studies on services provided by community health wo rkers (CHW, an overal l descriptive term reflecting this group of workers) for servic es like direct patient care and outreach, advocacy, education and screening services that are establishe d as cost effective. For CJ-120example, Beckham (2004)1 showed that CHW programs utilized for asthma management reduced total per capita costs from $310 to $129 and Emergency Department (ED) costs from $1,119 per participant to $188. On Diabetes Management, Fedder (2003)2 showed that Medicaid costs were reduced an average of $2,245 per patient per year by utilizing CHWs. The health and socio-economic services CH Rs provide to their communities support the HHS goal to improve the economic and social well-being of individuals, families and communities and serve to support patient self-management. Program accomplishments during FY 2008 include: 1) Increased individual tribal CH R Programs' use of RPMS CHR PCC; 2) Enhanced collaboration with various disciplines and offices within IHS on projects, including: Diabetes Program to provide outreach, referral and mon itoring services; Nutrition Program in the implementation of a 3-day specialty course emphasizing motivational interviewing, emotional eating and support to parents, with revisions planned based on student comments and evidence-based updates; Chronic Care Initiative (CC I) Leadership and Innovations in Planned Care (IPC) Pilot Sites -One great exampl e from an IPC pilot site wonderfully illustrates the value of the clinic and community-based provider connection to benefit patients. At White River Service Unit, which se rves the White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT), colorectal cancer (CRC) screen ing rates were vastly improved due to inclusion of the CHRs in the entire process. Clinic staff met with the CHRs regarding CRC and Fecal Occult Blood Te st (FOBT) screening. WMAT CHRs encouraged the use of simple English and pictures in the handouts but also advised that the explanation of the testing, rationale, etc. be in Apache as well. As a result, low-level literacy Instruct ions for FOBT were created which were \"low-tech\" in words and pictures and ve ry simple for patients to understand and follow. Clinic staff partnered with CHRs for the latter to do home follow-up of unreturned tests. These and other ch anges based on recommendations which came out of their meetings were implemented. White River Service Unit has seen the results in its improved CRC screen ing measure. More importantly, community members are being screened and educated on risk factors and are understanding the importance of such for their own health; Continued support of CHR Work Groups to advise on Medications, CHR PCC training and data application enha ncements, Curriculum, etc. 3) Enhanced collaboration within HHS: Specialized HIV/AIDS training and comm unity projects designed to increase awareness and enhance screening efforts in conjunction with the Minority Aids Initiative; Funds leveraged from resources outsid e CHR line item funding provided training CJ-121for 506 CHRs for HIV awareness, outreach and referrals for screening; First Responder; Basic Life Support Health Care Provider: Community Emergency Response Team; and Disaster Drills training courses; Implementation and incorporation into the CHR Curriculum of a CHR cancer training module through a National Cancer Institute-funded project aimed at involving the CHRs more effectively as part of the care team for cancer prevention, screening, education and tobacco cessation as the community arm of an expanded care team. Additional projec t work products included \"Winds of Hope\", an interactive CD-ROM; and \"Tal king Tools\" - templates to help build communication bridges between Clinic Pr oviders and CHRs which were tested with positive feedback from CHRs and clinic providers to help achieve the goal of improving overall cancer care to patients. Cancer was the second highest health priority identified by trib al leaders for FY 2009 Implementation of NIH quarterly mailings of NIH health information focusing on improving the development and dissemination of health information with American Indian and Alaska Native communities. 4) Revision of the CHR curriculum to cont ent which incorporates more certified nurse aide (CNA)-type training. Students pass upon scoring 75% on their written exam, completion of public speaking, presentation of a group project, and upon approval of taking vitals signs. Students felt their knowledge and skills improved. One CHR stated \"I felt the learning techniques used by Instruct ors were very good. I f eel that I am much better prepared to meet the needs of my community and I feel that the knowledge I learned I'll be able to retain.\" IHS and Tribal health facilities depend on CHRs to track down, contact and deliver critical patient health information to patients; educate and encourage them to make and follow up on appointments; and transport them if necessary. CHRs directly impact patient access to and delivery of services . Programmatic activiti es contribute towards clinical performance measures.

This increase represents $1,047,000 for pay increases, $1,628,000 for inflation, $867,000 for population growth, and $290,000 for 2 new Tr ibes (Mashpee and Tuscarora). CJ-122The total funding for Community provide: (or 98%) for '638 Self-Determina tion contracts and compacts with Tribes for direct health care, health pr omotion and disease prevention services as identified in tribal funding agreements and scopes of work to 1.9 million AI/AN population throughout 12 Areas in homes and other community-based settings. $1,232,560 (or 2%) is under direct Federal administration for training, information technology costs, special project s and national education mee ting(s); and is subject to tribal shares. These retained funds will also support the following plans in FY 2010, but not limited to: Continue efforts to train CHRs nationa lly on the CHR PCC data application; Continue HIT development and data support, specifically to (a) include limited patient education protocols and codes, (b ) require notation of referrals made to and from CHRs to help track access issu es and the potential impact CHRs make there, and (c) attempt to integrate continuous quality improvement efforts into data collection and data integrity; Enhancement of the national CHR web-ba sed tracking system to improve data reporting to/by the national level; Continue encouraging Tribes to send CH Rs to training and to utilize the RPMS CHR PCC data application; Assessment and dissemination of information related to CHR involvement and integration as part of the health care t eam in the Chronic Care Initiative and system improvement efforts which incorporate CHRs; Exploration of CHR involvement with overall IHS Alcohol Screening Brief Intervention (ASBI) efforts; Continue curriculum enhancement and provi sion of training (as mandated in the Indian Health Care Improvement Act as amended) to as many CHRs as can attend; Encourage injury prevention activities incl uding home assessments, child safety seat usage, safe cycling and helmet cl asses, smoke detectors, and gun locks to reduce the tremendous injury ra tes among AI/AN persons; and Maintain special projects such as certific ation of CHRs as CHR PCC trainers and consultation with the CHR PCC User Requirements Work Group. The CHR PCC User Requirements Work Group, comprised of CHRs, clinicians and technical experts, will work other important stak eholders in the IHS RPMS to address functionality of the data system to include appropriate patient education components (cancer, diabetes, cardiova scular, etc.), appropriate medical terminology, and tracking of referrals made, along with patient access to and attendance at clinical appointments. Among other responsib ilities it will help address deployment and implementation issues for non-federal employees of CHR PCC. CJ-123The majority of CHR services are provided to patients in their homes or community settings (see the following chart), which re quire funds for transportation. Data indicates that services provided in homes increased dramatically over the last year - nearly 55% for FY 2008 compared to 36% in FY 2007 - perh aps reflecting patient s' transportation challenges to access health services. Many factors impact the amount and level of services CHRs are able to provide: the rela tive isolation of many AI/AN living in rural areas; the wide fluctuation of gas prices; and certainly the e ffect of the receiving funding so late in the year pursuant to continuing resolutions, impacting the ability of these providers to plan and provide for other than es sential services, such as those for dialysis patients with no other transportation resource.

This number was extrapolated from 55% reporting; however it should be noted that more than 20 of th e reporting CHR Programs had just started in late 2008. 2The Program Performance target above represents an effort by the IHS national CHR Pr ogram to obtain specific service hours provided in the categories of diabetes, heart, hypertension, nutrition, cancer, other chronic, dialysis, obesity, depression, renal failure, and liver disease rela ted to IHS GPRA indicators and drawn from the CHR PCC software application. 3Training conducted on CHR PCC suggests that CHRs routinely under-report the servic es they provide. Typically they report 2-3 services, but when queried further they identify 5-7 additional services that regularly are unreported (checking homes for hazards as part of injury prevention efforts, providing homemaker services, providing health information on/checking medications, c oordinating appointments, interpreting/tr anslating, health education). 4Patient contacts are the number of services x number served 5 Estimate based on inclusion of con tinuing education trainees at FY 2008 National CHR Education meeting 6National educational meeting in 06 accounted for additional persons trained. 7Revised from previously published estimates 8Revised from previously published estimates - reduction in percentage of budget estimated for training purposes 9Revised from previously published estimates We believe the increased number of patient contacts reflects improvement of the data system to reflect data integrity; and that more CHRs are beginning to code accurately the types and number of services they're provi ding. We think that reasons why the CHR Program missed its Chronic Di sease targets include: 1) Data-related issues mentioned in the key challenges below; 2) The fact that so many CHRs still need trai ning on how to enter data into RPMS CHR PCC; 3) Increased costs of trying to do business in a year when record-breaking oil and gasoline prices affected so many services provided in the commun ity, such as patient transportation by CHRs and travel for CHRs to reach patients; and 4) Measuring \"hours\" of services ma y not be the optimal measure. With the proposed funding increase for FY 2010, the CHR program will strive to reach the level of services proposed in FY 2009. Key challenges affecting results: 1) Tribes have the option under self-determination to use any data system they deem best supports their needs. RPMS CHR P CC is the only data system by which IHS can furnish data for budget purposes or Progr am management. If Tribes elect a data source other than RPMS CHR PCC, IHS cannot report the services, activities, trends, CJ-125or achievements of tribal CHR Programs. Support by tribal leadership for use of CHR PCC is needed. 2) Access to RPMS CHR PCC is challenged by geographic barriers (remoteness) which impact connections to internet via phone or satellite. 3) Access is further complicated by a) necessary federal security requirements fo r Tribal members to request access to RPMS through the Network Operation Securi ty Center (NOSC), to complete the IHS Information Technology Access Control (ITAC) and Rules of Behavior (RoB) forms, and to complete annual security awareness training; and b) the need to persuade Chief Executive Offi cers at the facility level that CHRs should have access to RPMS CHR PCC.

It continues to provide this service in addition to evaluation of vaccine effectiveness and the medical management of persons with hepatitis and liver disease. The Immunization (Haemophilus Influenza; Hib) Program started in 1989 w ith a targeted Haemophilus influenzae type b prevention project in the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta and now maintains high vaccine coverage by providing resources, training and coordination to tribal faciliti es throughout Alaska. These programs are components of the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium (ANTHC) which is based in Anchorage, Alaska. Hepatitis B Program According to the report \"Regional Differences in Indian Health\" released March 2008, liver disease is the 5th leading cause of d eath in American Indian and Alaska Natives (AI/AN), just behind diabetes. Based on dem onstrated high rates of disease, program activities include clinical care of chroni c liver disease patients, consultation on immunization and hepatitis issu es, regular medical monitoring and clinical care follow-up of hepatitis B carriers, follow-up and new ev aluation of hepatitis C infected persons, follow-up of persons with autoimmune liver di sease, and follow-up of large cohorts of infants, children and adults vaccinated with hepatitis A and B vaccine to determine duration of immunity and if booster doses will be needed in the future. In addition, the program implemented a clinical protocol to diagnose, evaluate and counsel patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The pr ogram uses sophisticated computer-based applications that integrate labor atory and other clinical data in to a series of reports which CJ-127 allows program clinicians to follow a large number of patients with chronic hepatitis and other liver disease. This allows IHS to work closely with Tribal and Alaska Native Regional Corporations to car e for these patients, includi ng making at least one visit yearly to all rural Tribal Hospitals and regi onal clinics to conduct liver clinics, educate staff and advise public health admini strators and Native Health Boards. The program accomplishments are: The Liver Disease and Hepatitis Program follows patients statewide with chronic hepatitis B with the goal of reducing the lifetime risk of death from liver cancer or cirrhosis from 25 percent to <10 perc ent by early detection and removal of hepatocellular cancer and tr eatment with antiviral medications. In 2006 and 2007, we screened 60 to 63 perc ent of AI/AN with chronic hepa titis B or C infection (n = 2251 and 2306, respectively) for liver cancer at least once during the year. Among AI/AN with chronic hepatitis B (n = 1148), 70 (6 pe rcent) patients starte d antiviral therapy and it is estimated that 200-300 (17-26 percent) may need antiv iral therapy in the next 5 years. The program monitors Alaska Natives statew ide with hepatitis C infection for alpha- fetoprotein to detect liver cancer early a nd perform liver function tests to identify potential treatment candidates. Among AI /AN with chronic hepatitis C (n = 1196 91 patients, or 8 percent, have been treated with 6 month to 1-year courses of antiviral therapy. With the advent of several new poten t and more effective antiviral agents are expected to be licensed in the next 2 to 3 years, an estimated 300 to 400, or 25 to 33 percent, patients will need therapy fo r Hepatitis C in the next 5 years. The program actively screens for autoimm une hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the Alaska Native population. AIH and PBC have high mortal ity rates but treatment, usually life long, can reduce mortality to < 10 percent. The program ha s determined the prevalence of AIH among AI/AN to be 42.9/100,000 (highest of any et hnic group reported in the world) and PBC among the highest in the world. The program will conduct studies to better understand and monitor the treatment of this disease. Due to the high rates of obesity and type-2 diabetes in Alaska Natives, the program has increased surveillance, screening, counseling and treatment of nonalcoholic fatt y liver disease (NAFLD) which appears to be present in over 10 percent of the Alaska Native population. NAFLD can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer in some patients. The program is continuing the largest and longest studies on the immunogenicity, safety and long-term efficacy of hepatitis A and B vaccines in infants, children and adults in the world with 1,050 patients enrolle d. The results of ma ny of these studies are published and have made a significant contribution to the literature and to date have had great influence on recommenda tions that the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has made th at booster doses are not yet needed for children and adults who received hepatitis A and B vaccine. Since these vaccines are universally given to all children in the US, these studies are crucial to the US immunization policy for all US citizens, not just AI/AN. CJ-128 The program helped to estab lish a Molecular Biology Laborato ry at the Alaska Native Medical Center, which, to our knowledge, is the only laboratory of this type to be in an IHS facility. Work conducted there ha s improved our understanding of hepatitis virus genotypes and disease outcomes and allowed us to closely monitor viral loads. Due to budgetary constraints at the Alas ka Native Medical Center, laboratory activities have been put on-hold, with the dur ation of closure antic ipated to be about one year. The Hepatitis Program will work to ensure its reopening. The program collaborated with Center fo r Disease Control (C DC) in Atlanta on a study of the prevalence of chronic liver dise ase in patients seen at the Alaska Native Medical Center. This study w ill help to illustrate the ove rall health impact and help us better address disease disparities. International Activities: The program help ed to establish a Circumpolar Hepatitis Working Group whose purpose is to exchange information and develop programs to promote hepatitis vaccination and treatmen t programs for indigenous populations in the Arctic (Alaska, Greenland, Canadian autonomous Tribal Regions and Siberian Indigenous Groups). The ANTHC Liver Diseas e Program is helping Greenland plan to introduce universal hepatitis B vaccinat ion into the Inuit po pulation and helping Arctic Countries to develop treatment pr ograms for hepatitis B modeled after the Alaska Program. In addition, the ANTHC program is now advising World Health Organization (WHO) in establishing treatment programs for hepatitis B in underserved countries in Afri ca and Asia utilizing expe rience gained from the successful program in Alaska. Immunization (Hib) Program The purpose of the Immunization Program is to maximize the prevention of vaccine-preventable disease through advocacy, tr aining, resources, i mmunization tracking, coordination of vaccine delivery and research on vaccine-preventable disease. We train 13 regional tribal coordinators to track immuni zations, recall patients, ensure quality of electronic immunization records and report i mmunization rates quarterly. We report statewide immunization coverage rates to IHS headquarters. In 2007 and 2008, the Immunization Program im plemented routine rotavirus and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and is currently working with the CDC Arctic Investigation Program and Tribal agencies to promote and monitor the impact of HPV vaccine in Alaska Native females. The program is working with tribal public relations to address parental questions and highlight th e importance of vaccines. The program is collaborating with the local tribal corporati on to develop a plan to address extremely high rates of non-vaccine invasive pneumococcal di sease through early use, under a research protocol, of an expanded pneumococcal va ccine expected to be license by 2010. The Liver Disease and Hepatitis Program (H epatitis B Program) and the Immunization (Haemophilus Influenza) Program both provide consultation on imm unization and liver disease issues to Indian H ealth Service and Tribal provi ders throughout the US. Both programs conduct research and publish journal articles in peer-re viewed journals on CJ-129 topics related to vaccine-preventable disease, hepatitis, other liver diseases and health disparities in AI/AN. The program accomplishments are: Met the IHS-All GPRA target of 78 per cent of childhood immunizations in FY 2008; the current level is 80% for 4-3-1-3-3 and for 4-3-1-3-3-1 (including varicella). Greatly exceeded the IHS-All GPRA target objective of 76 percent for pneumococcal (Pneumovax) immunization of elders in FY 2007 with 91 percent of elders immunized; the current level is 90 percent. Alaska Area was below the IHS-All GP RA target objective of 59 percent for influenza immunization of elders in FY 2007 with an immunization rate of 53 percent; the current level is 47 percent. Elimination of vaccine-type pneumoco ccal cases among Alaska Native children <2 years old. 98 percent decrease in Hib disease w ith over 450 cases prev ented by vaccine. Implemented routine rotavirus immuni zation in Alaska Native infants. Rapid increase in HPV vaccine coverage with 1+HPV doses in Alaska Native teen girls from 16 percent at the end of 2007 to the current le vel of 41 percent. Completed Respiratory Virus Study that demonstrates the association of respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus or meta pneumovirus in the majority of respiratory hospitalizations. International collaboration with Australia and New Zealand colleagues to study an improvement for prevention and care of ch ronic lung disease and bronchiectasis in Alaska Native children. Published 4 articles in peer-reviewed journals and co-authored two Alaska Epidemiology Bulletins; manuscript accepted for publication demonstrating continued disparity in otitis media vis its among Alaska Native children compared with other American Indian and the US population. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2005 $1,572,000 2006 $1,621,000 2007 $1,681,000 2008 $1,733,000 2009 Recovery Act $0 2009 Omnibus $1,823,000 CJ-130 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2010 budget request for the Hepatitis B and Haemophilus Immunization program is $1,934,000, an increase of $111,000 over the FY 2009 Omnibus level for pay increases, inflation, and population growth. Given the addition of grant funding made av ailable through research studies conducted by the Hepatitis and Immunization Programs, this program can support the current level of services. Planned activities for FY 2010 include focused clinical and research activities in persons w ith chronic hepatitis B infection, and the continuance of clinical and research activities in persons with hepatitis C, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune and other liver diseases. Beginning in FY 2009, the State of Alaska is implementing a State Immunization Registry (VacTrAK). The Immunization program will continue to be involved with the VacTrAK rollout and will work with our Tribal partners across the state to begin contributing data in FY 2010. VacTr AK will include a 2-way exchange of immunizations, which dramatically impr ove the accuracy and completeness of immunization records and pr event over-vaccination a nd missed opportunities to vaccinate.

The IHS provides fundi ng through contracts and grants with 34 urban Indian 501(c) (3) non-profit organizat ions to provide health care services in 41 sites throughout the U.S. Urban Indian He alth Organizations (UIHO) define their Title V, P.L. 94-437, as amended, scope of work and services based upon the documented unmet needs of the urban AI/AN community they serve. Each UIHO is governed by a Board of Directors of whom at least 51% are AI/AN. UIHOs provide primary medical health care and public health case management wrap- around services for approximately 76,000 urban AI/ANs who do not have access to the resources offered on the reservation. Urba n Indian primary care clinics and case management programs provide high quality, culturally accessible, affordable and accountable health services including ambulator y health care, health assessment, health promotion, disease education, child abuse prevention, immunizati ons, and behavioral health services. UIHOs fulfill IHS data re porting requirements including the IHS GPRA report and the Diabetes Non-Clinical Audit report. All UIHOs fulfill the HHS and IHS Strategic Plans. Two programs participat e in the IHS Innovations in Planned Care Initiative. The 34 UIHOs are categorized based upon the leve l of services they have the capacity to provide. There are 21 full ambulatory facilities. A full ambulatory UIHO provides direct medical care to the population served for 40 or more hou rs per week. The range of services varies greatly among the programs that are define d as full ambulatory. Some full ambulatory CJ-133programs have two or more full time medi cal doctors, full time pharmacist, provide lab and radiology services, and have on site de ntal providers. At the opposite end of the spectrum, some full ambulatory programs have a full time medical provider on site but do not offer dental, pharmacy, la b or radiology services. Seven of the 21 full ambulatory programs also receive HRSA 330 funding and are designated HRSA 330 Commun ity Health Centers. 1. South Dakota Urban Indian H ealth, Inc., Pierre, SD 2.

Tucson Indian Center, T ucson, AZ The target audience or eligibility for UIHP health care services is defined in the authorizing program legislation. An \"Urban Indian\" eligible for services, as codified in 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(c), (f), (g), includes any individual who: 1) Resides in an urban center, which is any co mmunity that has a su fficient urban Indian population with unmet health needs to warrant assistance under Title V, as determined by the Secretary of the Depa rtment of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"); and who 2) Meets one or more of the following criteria: a. Irrespective of whether he or she lives on or near a reservation, is a member of a tribe, band, or other organized group of Indians, including: i. those tribes, bands, or groups terminated since 1940, and ii. those recognized now or in the future by the State in which they reside; or b. Is a descendant, in the 1st or 2nd degree, of any such member described in (A); or c. Is an Eskimo or Aleut or other Alaska Native; or d. Is the descendant of an Indian who was re siding in the State of California on June 1, 1852, so long as the descendant is now living in said State; or1 e. Is considered by the Secretary of the Depart ment of the Interior to be an Indian for any purpose; or 1 Eligibility of California Indians may be demonstrated by documentation that the individual: (1) Holds trust interests in public domain, nationa l forest, or Indian reservation allotments; or (2) Is listed on the plans for distribution of assets of Califor nia rancherias and reservations under the Act of August 18, 195 8 (72 Stat. 619), or is the descenda nt of such an individual. CJ-135f. Is determined to be an Indian under regulations pertaining to the Urban Indian Health Program that are promulgated by the Secretary of HHS. Urban programs report on the amounts and purposes for which Title V, P.L. 94-437, as amended, funding is used, including: a) the number of eligible Urban Indians for whom services are provided, and b) the number and type of services provided eligible Urban Indians. Information contained in the 2007 Urban Common Reporting Requirements (UCRR) report indicated that th e Urban Indian health programs served a population that was 55 percent American Indian. The re maining 45 percent included other minority groups, Medicare/Medicaid eligibles, and othe rs with private insu rance and individuals who paid on a sliding-fee scale. The actual percent of each non-Indian group is not available because this information is not gathered through the UCRR. UIHOs have policies requiring supporting documentation of the eligibility of a particular individual included in their Title V reports which include : Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood (CDIB), BIA Form 4432, Tribal Membership Card, Trib al Correspondence, Birth Certificate(s) (state seal or certified copy) to establish descendants (first or second degree), Family Documents (e.g., fam ily bible), and Se lf-Certification. In FY 2008, the UIHOs effectively implemented the HHS Priorities, the HHS Strategic Plan Goals and Objectives Fiscal Y ears 2007-2011, and the IHS Strategic Plan 2007- 2011. Twenty programs were provided circuits and routers and connected to RPMS. All 20 programs also participated in RPMS training courses and are implementing RPMS throughout their programs. In May, 2008, one UIHO successfully implemented RPMS/EHR. The 2008 GPRA reporting cycle (July 1, 2007 - June 30, 2008) was successful for the Urban Indian programs. Areas of greatest accomplishment included: (1) 100 percent of the urban programs reported GPRA - 34/34, and (2) 5 programs reported through CRS; 25 reported using 100 percent review of the appropriate data source - 25/34 (as opposed to sampling a smaller percentage of records). It is estimated that in all output categories listed, the UIHOs will in crease encounters by 2 percent. Encounters fall into seven categories: Medical services cover medical services either on-site or off-site for the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabi litation of illness or injury. This category also includes obstetrics and gynecology services. Ancillary services cover services provided for lab services, imaging services and pharmacy. Dental services cover all de ntal services for the purpose of prevention, assessment or treatment of a dental problem. Health Education services cover the provision of a defined program of health education services either performed on-site or off-site for the purpose of health education and disease prevention. Educational programs include obesity prevention, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, cardiovascular disease pr evention, and smoking cessation. CJ-136 Nutrition services cover a defined set of nutrition services for the purpose of prevention, assessment, or counsel ing of a nutritional problem. Behavioral Health services c over a defined set of behavior al health services either on-site or off-site for the preventi on, assessment, counseling, treatment, or rehabilitation of a psychosocial pr oblem including substance abuse. Other services cover allied health (audiology, optometry, podiatry, speech therapy), community health (outreach to pa tients, assistance with other services), and enabling (transportation, medical records, referral for additional health care services). Urban programs established partnerships with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). All urban programs have active partne rships with their local VA. They have agreements with the local VA that identify jo int program initiatives and program services such as alcohol/substance abuse prevention and treatment, HP/DP, and mental health services. The Office of Urban Indian Health Program received a program assessment review in 2003, and received an Adequate rating. The re view cited program management as a strong attribute of the program. As a result of the review, the program has taken the following actions: Baselines and targets have been estab lished through the IHS GPRA process for the OUIHP. A workgroup was established and produced a comprehensive report addressing the issues from the 2003 review. The repor t identified specific action items for complying with the review recommendatio ns. The workgroup was disbanded after completion of the report. The OUHIP will continue to pursue the mission of raising the health status of the urban AI/AN population. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2005 $31,816,000 2006 $32,744,000 2007 $33,755,000 2008 $34,547,000 2009 Recovery Act $0 2009 Omnibus $36,189,000 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2010 budget request for the Office of Urban Indian Health Programs is $38,139,000, an increase of $1,950,000 over the FY 2009 Omnibus level. This increase represents $1,950,000 for pay increases, me dical inflation, an d population growth. CJ-137The budget request for the OUIHP will be used to provide quality, culturally-competent health care to the urban AI/ AN population. Services include medical, dental, behavioral health, health education, immunizations, and many others. The increases for pay costs, medical inflation, and population growth, will allow the program to continue the current level of servi ces provided. Measures and targets have been set for the OUIHP for FY 2010. The OUIHP Efficiency Measure relates to Cost per User per Year. The program met this measure for FY 2007: $683 per user. The formula for this number uses the total amount funded, from all sources, divided by the total number of users (AI/AN and non AI/AN). With the change of reporting system from the UCRR to the UDS for 2008 reporting, the 2008 numbers will not be available until July 2009. This will be the timeline for reporting in future years as well. The target for FY 2009 is $845 and the FY 2010 target is $918. This is an increase of 8 percent. With the increases for pay costs, medical inflation and population growth, and use of other leveraged funding sources, this target should be met. A new measure has been added in FY 2009 during improvement actions from the UIHP program assessment (UIHP-7): Nu mber of AI/AN served. The actual number served for FY 2007 was 76,359 AI/AN clients. Numbers for 2008 will be available, through the UDS report in Ju ly 2009. The target for FY 2009 is 79,000 AI/AN clients served, with an increase of 2 percent to 80,500 in FY 2010. With the changing economy, this target should be met as more urban AI/AN will likely seek health care services from the UIHOs. The Diabetes targets for the UIHOs include Ideal Glycemic Control and Controlled Blood Pressure (<130/80). UIHOs met the 2008 Ideal Glycemic Control measure at 39 percent (100 percent audit) and this will be maintained through FY 2010. Blood Pressure Control wa s a baseline for FY 2008 and target measures will be determined for FY 2009 and FY 2010. Baseline data will be available in June 2009. By FY 2010 the implementation of RP MS should be completed, thus the elimination of UIHP-4. All 21 full ambulatory care programs will be online and operating RPMS. The OUIHP provided funding for UIHO program health professionals and staff to attend RPMS tr aining including: Patient Information Management Systems (PIMS) training, PCC data entry, patient registration, third party billing, behavioral h ealth, diabetes, i-care, and s ite manager training. Nine IHS Area Offices' Office of Information Technology (OIT) were funded to: (1) procure and install circuits, hardware , and servers to support urban health programs, and (2) support IT personnel in cluding the business office and health information management office costs in support of urban programs. It is estimated that in all output categori es listed in the table below, the UIHOs will increase encounters by 2 percent. This is keeping in line with the measure for the program increasing AI/AN users by 2 percent for FY 2010. CJ-138The UIHOs have been very successful in leveraging their IHS funding through the contracts and grants. In addition, many programs are increasi ng funding by receiving 330 funding from HRSA to become Community Health Centers; working with SAMHSA for funding of behavioral health project s; and the CDC for disease prevention. The level of services suppor ted by this request is an in crease of 5 percent from the previous year. The UIHOs will continue to report GPRA, implement and utilize RPMS and EHR, and continue to provide quality h ealth services to the urban Indian population.

However, IHS made their first awards in 1978 because Congress had not appropriated funds for the IHP program until 1978. The purpose of the program is: To enable American Indians and Alaska Na tives (AI/ANs) to enter the health care professions through a carefully designed sy stem of preparatory, professional, and continuing educational assistance programs; To serve as a catalyst to the develo pment of Indian communities by providing educational opportunities and enabling AI/AN health care professionals to further Indian self-determination in th e delivery of health care; To develop and maintain American Indian psychology career recruitment programs as a means of encouraging Indians to en ter the mental health field; and To assist Indian health programs to recruit and retain qualified health professionals. Scholarship Program (Sections 103 and 104) - In FY 1979, the scholarship programs started with three programs. The Preparatory and Pre-Graduate Scholarship Programs, Section 103, prepare students to enter a health profession training/program. The Preparatory Scholarship Program provides financial assistance for AI/AN (federally or state-recognized) students who enroll in comp ensatory or preparatory courses leading to entry into a health professi onal school such as nursing, pharmacy and others. The Pre- Graduate Scholarship Program provides financ ial support for AI/AN (f ederally or state- recognized) students who enroll in courses leading to a bachelor 's degree in specific pre- CJ-141 professional areas such as pre-medicine, pre- dentistry and others as needed by Indian health programs. The third scholarship program, the Health Professions Scholarship Program, Section 104, provides financial support for AI/AN stude nts (federally reco gnized only) who are enrolled in health professions or allied health professions programs. Students incur service obligations and payback requirem ents on acceptance of funding from this program. Graduate students and junior- and se nior-level students have priority unless otherwise specified. In support of Tribal consultation, the IHS receives a recommended priority list from Tribal health programs that assist the Agency in determining discipline priorities. The FY 2008 priorities consisted of 27 health professions, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists and dentists. The IHS Scholarship Program made 2,216 sc holarship awards between FY 2004 and FY 2008 (an average of 443 awards per year). A total of 337 scholarships were awarded in FY 2008 for school year 2008-2009. A total of 101 of the over 1,900 new applications were able to be funded. A total of 236 continuing sc holarship students (students previously receiving the IHS sc holarship) were awarded cont inuing scholarship support. The cost of health professions education con tinues to increase. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data from the last 5 years, the IHS can expect average tuition and fee costs to increase over 7 percent annually. The average cost per IHS scholar including tuition, fees, monthly stipend and other sc hool related costs increased almost $14,000 in FY 2008 Seventy-one percent of the scholarships went to students in the Health Professions Scholarship Program. These students receiv ed a total of 241 scholarships (38 new and 203 continuing). Fifteen percent or 50 schol arships (33 new and 17 continuing) went to students in Health Professions Preparatory Scholarship Prog ram and fourteen percent or 46 scholarships (30 new and 16 continuing) went to students in Hea lth Professions Pre- Graduate Program.

For other disciplines post graduate training, while not required, is considered to imp rove clinical skill s and knowledge (e.g., pharmacists). Individuals in these disciplines request a deferment of their scholarship service obligation until they complete their pos t graduate clinical training. Physician deferments are limited to primary care specialty residencies: Specialties for Deferment Deferment Period Physician - Emergency Medicine 3 Years Family Medicine 3 Years General Pediatrics 3 Years Obstetrics and Gy necology 4 Years General Psychiatry 4 Years Internal Medicine/Pediatrics 4 Years Internal Medicine/Family Practice 4 years General Surgery 5 Years CJ-143Specialties for Deferment Deferment Period Anesthesiology 5 Years Clinical Psychologist 2 years Social Worker 2 years Dietician 1 Year Pharmacist 1 Year In FY 2008, there were 83 health professiona ls on deferment.

This sample size is a pproximately equivalent to the number of new scholarship students entering the program over the last 6 years. The review looked at the service obligat ion owed and the years of service provided by the scholar. The review showed that on averag e scholars received 2.21 years of Health Professions (Section 104) scholarship fundi ng and they served an average of 6.13 years of full-time clinical service in thei r health profession at an Indian health program. On average, scholars served 3.92 years beyond their service obligation.; The area scholarship coordinators sought out potential scholars by sending marketing packets of information to schools an d Tribes, review 2,000-3,000 applications annually, and assuring follow-up with schools and students to assure payments are processed for tuition and that students ar e receiving their stip end and are meeting their academic requirements; Developed a series of Scholar ship E-newsletters that include information for past and unfunded applicants with assistive inform ation for successful re-application and included reminder information and to welcome new students; Finalized banner advertisements for print and radio media information about the IHS Scholarship Program. Loan Repayment Program (Section 108) - The IHS Loan Repayment Program (LRP) offers health care professionals the opport unity to ease qualified health professions related student loan debts and help Indian he alth programs meet the staffing needs of high CJ-144priority sites. Applicants agree to serve two years at an Indian health program in exchange for up to $40,000 in loan repaymen t funding and up to an additional $8,000 to offset the tax liability. Loan repayment reci pients with more than $40,000 in loan debt can extend their two year contract annually and receive up to an additional $20,000 per year, plus up to $4,000 for taxes, until their or iginal loan debt is paid. For many health disciplines (e.g., physician, dentist, podiatrist , and optometrist), the average applicant's loan debt exceeds $140,000 (requiring more than 7 years of loan repayment support). In FY 2008, the LRP had a total of 907 health care professionals who requested loan repayment funding. The LRP made a total of 581 loan repayment awards totalling $21,502,681. There were 382 new two-year contra cts and 199 one-year extensions of existing loan repayment contracts. This number includes the additional $5 million for the LRP added in FY 2008 and additional fundi ng provided by programs and supplemental funding provided by sites (the hospital or clinic provides funding to the LRP to cover the cost of a loan repayment contract to be able to assure eligible app licants that they will receive loan repayment if the health professional accepts a position at that site). Not all health care professionals who applie d for loan repayment could be funded. A total of 326 health care professionals applyi ng for loan repayment did not receive funding in FY 2008. A total of 231 of these health professionals work in Indian health programs (see Matched Not Awarded column below) . Of the 581 LRP awards in FY 2008, 322 went to federal employees (191 to civil se rvice and 131 to Commissioned Corps officers), 258 to tribal employees and 1 to an employee of an urban Indian program.

The IHS Loan Repaym ent Program (LRP) reviewed the records of 1,300 unique individual who received lo an repayment contracts between Fiscal Year (FY) 1989 and FY 2003. FY 2003 was us ed as a cut off to allow time for LRP recipients to complete their initial two year contract and up to three extension contracts. During this period, the LR P made on average approximately 225 new awards annually. This sample size represents approximately 44 percent of all new awards (and subsequent extensions for thes e individuals) from this time period. The results of the study showed that the LRP recipient service oblig ation period average was 2.65 years. The average retention peri od for loan repayment recipients was 7.44 years. LRP recipients, on average, serv ed 4.79 years beyond their service obligation; and In preparation for the next loan repaymen t cycle (with applications being accepted starting in October 2008 and loan repaymen t awards starting Spring 2009), the LRP developed or updated many materials, in cluding marketing materials, a LRP recruitment packet including a DVD, a LRP Application Handbook, a LRP Recipient Handbook for new loan repayment recipients, and a series of newsletters to LRP applicants and recipients to keep th em updated about the LRP and the program requirements. In FY 2009 and FY 2010, IHS expects tuition cost increases will continue to lengthen the number of years of loan repayment support required by many health disciplines and will decrease the number of new loan repayment awards. Loan debt data from the IHS Loan Repayment Program for three key disciplines appears to show that IHS loan repayment recipient debt continues to increase at a rate si milar to that of college tuition and fee cost increases (average increase of 6.3 percen t per year across all three disciplines). Health Profession Loan Debt FY 1999 Loan Debt 2008 Physician $107,230 $143,428 Dentist $ 78,600 $161,884 Nurse $ 31,910 $ 35,493 Recruitment and Retention - The IHS continues to s upport the IHS recruitment and retention efforts and development of health pr ofessionals in critical health professional shortage areas. While most health professionals are recruite d to work in full-time positions, some health professionals provided temporary service to IHS facilities through several mechanisms such as direct employment into temporary positions, direct contracting with various facilities, working with contract locum tene ns companies, and volunteering their services for various periods of time. CJ-146The IHS utilizes recruiters fo r physicians, nurses, dentists and pharmacists. In addition, many health professional staff members assi st in recruitment activities by visiting professional schools, attending professional meet ings as IHS representatives, and acting as preceptors and mentors for health professi ons students who come to their facilities as part of their educational training. In FY 2008, the Health Professions Support Br anch (HPSB) became fully staffed with the appointment of a new Branch Chief. The HPSB conducted an extensive review of current health professions staffing, past recruitment and retention strategies a nd processes and trends in recruitment in the private sector. From this review, an IHS Health Professions Recruitment Plan was developed. The plan ca lls for better integr ation of recruitment activities within IHS Headquarters, Area Offices and with field st aff. The HPSB is currently in the process of informing IHS leadership about the plan and its related activities. The Health Professions Recru itment Branch continues to: Develop and update recruitment and marketing materials including advertisements, recruitment materials and web sites; Advertise in professional journals and on recruitment websites; Update the IHS Public Health Professions web site at http://www.careers.ihs.gov/ Develop new websites incl uding a new physician website (http://www.physicians.ihs.gov). The new phys ician website will allow physicians and medical residents to re quest recruitment and application materials and ask questions of recruiters; Work with IHS Human Resources staff and with the Office of Commissioned Corps Operations (OCCO) to identify ways to shorten the time required to hire new health professions staff (in both civil service and Commissioned Corps). The IHS and OCCO have two joint recrui ter positions assigned to the IHS Health Professions Support Branch to assist in recruiting health professionals into IHS. Attended health fairs at colleges; Attended high school career days; and Sent direct mailings to stude nt health professionals. Currently, vacancy rates and total number of vacancies for key health disciplines continue to remain high.

WWAMI Rural Health Research Center, University of Washington, Nevada Office of Rural Health Recruitment and Retention Symposium, La s Vegas, NV; Jan 10, 2007. While the dental vacancy rate remains critical, we have seen the most dramatic increase in the physician vacancy rates. The scholar ship and loan repayment programs are unable to provide enough health care professionals to reduce the substantial vacancy rates, but they do continue to have a major impact on meeti ng the staffing needs of hard to fill sites. Extern Program (Section 105 ) - The Extern Program, is designed to give IHS scholars and other health professions students the opportunity to gain clinical experience with IHS and Tribal health professionals in their c hosen discipline. The program also allows students the opportunity to work at sites they may want to apply to for employment after they complete their health professions trai ning. This program is open to scholars and non-scholars. Students are employed up to 120 days annually, with most students working during the summer months. In FY 2008, the Extern Program funded a total of 133 health professional, pre-gra duate and preparatory students. A total of 94 participants (or 71 percent) were Health Professions students, 7 participants (or 5 percent) were pre-graduate students and 32 participants (or 24 percent) were preparatory students. Twenty- four (or 18 percent) of the 133 externs were IHS scholarship recipients (19 were Health Professions scholars, 3 were Pr e-Graduate and 2 were Preparatory). Ninety-five (or 71 percent) of the 133 student externs were Am erican Indian or Alaska Native. The following health disciplines were funded in FY 2008: Extern Program (Section 105) Preparatory - 32 students Pre-Nursing 8 Pre-Sanitarian 1 Pre-Physical Therapy 2 Pre-Social Work 1 Pre-Engineering 1 Other 18 Pre-Phar m acy 1 Extern Pr ogram (Sec tion 105) Pre-Graduate - 7 Students Pre-Medicine 5 Pre-Dentis try 2 Extern Pr ogram (Section 105) Health Professions - 94 students Nurse (ADN, BS & MS) 36 Physical Thera pist 3 Pharmacist 11 Dentist 2 Co unseling Psychologist 9 Health Records 2 Heal th Education 8 Physic i an (MD & DO) 2 Health Care Administration 6 Dental Hy gi enist 1 Engineer 4 Occupatio nal Therapist 1 Social Work 4 Medical Technology 1 Dietitian 3 Master Public Health (Ep i) 1 Grant Programs - The IHP administers three grant programs: Indians Into Nursing (Section 112); Indians Into Me dicine (Section 114); and Indi ans Into Psychology (Section 217). Almost half of all IHS IHP grant funds are not competitively awarded. CJ-148The Quentin N. Burdick American Indians in to Nursing Program, Section 112, helps to increase the number of nurses, nurse midwives , nurse anesthetists, and nurse practitioners who deliver health care se rvices to Indians. In FY 2008, grantees supported numerous student participants: Interacting with pre-nurs ing and nursing Indian st udents through professional development workshops, health career forums, and other activities; and Directly supporting AI/AN nursing students. The Indians into Medicine (INMED) Progr am, Section 114, encourages and assists Indian students preparing for a career in healthcare. The outreach goal to tribal communities is to provide greater exposure to careers in healthcare, providing academic support for students through tutoring and career counseling, assisting with financial aid and scholarship applications, and of fering summer educational sessions. Grantees supported over 200 student participants: Interacted with Indian students through professional development workshops, health career forums, and other activities; Conducted site visits to tribes to identify potential students, worked with health career clubs at Indian schools, and provided work shops in tribal communities to discuss health issues; Provided travel grants to high-school and undergraduate students to assist them in attending health profession and I ndian health conferences; and Hosted a series of other programs that included a Summer Institute to expose students to advanced math and science, a Pathwa y Program to ease the transition between community colleges and the university, and MCAT Prep classes. The American Indians into Psychology (IN PSYCH) Program, Section 217, increases psychological services provided to Indian communities. The goal is to outreach to tribal communities in order to provi de greater exposure to the field of psychology, providing stipends to undergraduate a nd graduate students pursuing careers in psychology, and establishing training opportuni ties for psychology graduate students within tribal communities. Grantees supported over 300 student participants including: Undergraduate and gradua te psychology students; Students working in tribal me ntal health facilities; and Conducting school visits to identify potenti al students and provide workshops in tribal communities to discuss health issues.

Th is increase represents $389,000 for pay increases, non-medical inflati on and $2,854,000 for program increases. Scholarship Program In FY 2010, the scholarship budget of $15,765,841 would be an increase of $1,243,000 from the FY 2009 budget of $14,522,841. Administrative costs are expected to be to be approximately $750,000 (divided equally be tween continuing Section 103 and 104) leaving $15,015,841 available for scholarship awards. The FY 2010 priority funding in cludes the current scholarship recipients as well as the Section 104 scholars. The IHS Scholarship Program anticipates funding the 103 program at $3,139,560. Available funding for scholar ship awards will be $2,764,560 (total Section 103 budget of $3,139,560 minus $375,000 in ad ministrative costs) to include 55 continuation awards for Section 103 scholar s at a cost of $2,364,560 and 9 new awards at a cost of approximately $386,928. Appr oximately 230 continuing Section 104 and 55 new Section 104 scholarship students (mostly Section 103 scholars converting to Section 104) funding costs is approximately $12,251,281 (total Section 104 budget of $12,626,281 minus $375,000 in administrative costs). These calculations assume the average cost of a scholarship in FY 2009 is $39,918 and increases to $42,992 in FY 2010. CJ-150 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, college tui tion costs have increased an average of 7.7 percent annually for each of the last 5 years. The increased cost of a college education affects the number of scholarships IHS is able to award . In FY 2010, IHS expects that the increase of $1,243,000 for the Scholarship Program in the FY 2009 appropriation will help to offset the an ticipated tuition and fee cost increases. Loan Repayment Program The FY 2010 LRP budget from IHP funding is $20,197,964, an increase of $2,000,000 from FY 2009 budget of $18,197,964. The approx imate administrative cost of $961,533 leaves approximately $19,236,431 available for continuation of current loan repayment contracts and new awards. IHS anticipates approximately 430 requests fo r LRP contract extensions in FY 2010 due to the LRP FY 2008. At an anticipated LR P one-year contract cost of $24,163 in FY 2009 and $25,023 in FY 2010, the anticipated 430 c ontract extension requests will cost approximately $10,759,890. This would leave approximately $8,476,541 for approximately 176 new LRP two-year contract aw ards (at an average cost for a two-year contract in FY 2009 anticipated to be $46,830 and $48,145 in FY 2010). Externship Program The Extern Program, Section 105, re ceived $1,181,932 in FY 2008 and remains unchanged in FY 2010. This funding woul d provide approximately 135 summer externships (at an average cost of ap proximately $8,762). This budget provides for student externships for scholarship recipients to work at IHS and Tribal sites during non-academic periods. Quentin N. Burdick American Indians Into Nursing Program The Nursing program, Section 112, received $1,713,624 in FY 2009 and remains unchanged in FY 2010. Indians Into Medici ne (INMED) Program The INMED program, Section 114, received $1,126,253 in FY 2009 and remains unchanged in FY 2010.

FY 2008: 61% (Target Exceeded) 69% 75% millions) $36.3 $0 $0 $0 The performance goal refers to placement of scholars within 90 days of completion of their health professions degr ee or training. The IHP work s with scholars, discipline chiefs and sites to assist in the placement of available scholarship recipients in health facilities, i.e., hospitals and clinics. The IHS Scholarship Program's goal was to increase the 90 day placement rate by 5 percent (from 52 percent in FY 2007 to 57 percent in FY 2008) for new scholarship graduates. This goal was exceeded, with the percentage of new gr aduates serving at a site within 90 days of graduation increasi ng by 9 percent in FY 2008 (from 52 percent in FY 2007 to 61 percent in FY 2008) The Scholarship Program continues to improve program performance, as demonstrated by a 41 percent overall increase in the 90-day placement rate from FY 2004 to FY 2008. The performance target for FY 2010 is 75 percent placement rate within 90 days of graduation. Increased efficiency in placing health profession scholarship recipients can and will help improve the health care delivery sy stem at Indian health facilities, and the workload of health professional contributes towards the accomplishment of clinical and preventive health services.

Discretionary competitive grants to Tribes and Tribal organizations PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS Tribal Management grant funds have been ma de available to trib es since 1976, with the initial passage of the Indian Self-Det ermination and Education Assistance Act, (ISDEAA) P.L. 93-638 and as amended, Augus t 18, 2000. A Tribal Management Grant (TMG) award provides a Tribe the opportunity to assess, plan, or improve its capacity to assume Programs, Services, Functions and Activities (PSFA) of the IHS if it so chooses. The TMG Program is a national competitive grant program that awards grants annually to Federally-recognized Tribes and qualified Tribal Organizations. The TMG Program began shortly after passage of P.L. 93-638. Tribes and Tribal Organizations utilize TMG funding to enhance their management capabili ties through such projects as conducting health program related feasibility studies; development of Tribal specific health plans; Tribal health program operation evaluation; the development or improvement of Tribal health management structures such as es tablishing Tribal health boards and improving Tribal financial management systems to assist them in assuming all or part of existing Indian Health Service (IHS) programs, servi ces, functions, or activi ties. All of these activities improve the management capacity of Tribes to take on additional PSFA provided by the IHS. The IHS distributes the total appropriated amount into two parts - grant awards and program operations. There are approximately 224 Tribes that are currently Title I contractors and 322 Tribes that are Title V compactors of a total 562 Federally-r ecognized Tribes. The Title I Tribal contractors include a number of those Tribes directly served by federally-operated health service facilities that have made a decision to contract for funds to operate such IHS programs as alcohol and substance abuse, co mmunity health representative, emergency medical service, and other support and ancill ary programs. These Title I contractors, CJ-154many of whom consider themselves as direct service tribes (DST) have chosen not to compact all PSFA of the IHS. Other Title I Tribal contractors continue to pursue additional PSFA as their capacity grows and may eventually transition to Title V compact status. Title I contractors are those tribes that contracted PSFA under P.L. 93-638 ISDEAA and Title V compactors are those trib es that have compacted PSFA under Title II of P.L. 103-413 Self Governance to redesign a nd reallocate funds to meet tribal health priorities and needs. Tribes and Tribal organizations continually work to improve the quality of health care provided to their communities by achie ving and maintaining not only Federal standards/regulatory requirements but also applicable health care accreditations. Specific outcomes, as a result, of feasibility st udies, evaluation studies and management infrastructure grants are: The establishment of Tribal Health Boards which serve as health advisory committees to Tribal Councils; Training of Health Boards; Through Tribal health board initiatives and recommendations Tribal leaders are prepared to meet their communities' health needs; Tribal leaders also ensure complian ce through implementa tion of policy and procedure manuals in key ar eas such as quality assurance, medical records, and information technology systems. The TMG program provides an opportunity for Tribes to evaluate Federal programs and plan for the possibility of assuming ope rational control of a Federal program by contracting under the provisions of the ISDEAA. However, it must be recognized that the award of a self-determination contract or compact in and of itself should not be regarded as a measure of success of the TMG program. The Federal policy of self-determination recognizes the rights of Tribes to make a decision to contract to operate a Federal program or to decide to continue to have the Federal government administer a program on its behalf. This is the hallmark of a TMG award in that it provides a Tribe the opportunity to assess, plan, or improve its capacity to assume PSFA of the IHS if it so chooses. A Tribe then can make informed choices based upon the use of the TMG award to (1) build its capacity to take over PSFA of the IHS or (2) to improve the current capability to administer or manage those PSFA it is currently responsible for and not contract additional PSFA in order to eventually compact. This grant program is highly competitive and over time has resulted in a greater focus from the TMG program office to provide training sessions to assist Tribes (including previous applicants not select ed for funding) to prepare thei r grant proposals for a more competitive submission and environment. With the conversion to electronic su bmission of grant applications on www.grants.gov in 2005, the IHS anticipated that the tribal enti ties would be submitting fewer applications until knowledge of the electronic application process and experience in electronic submission increased to a comfortable level. The drop in numbers in the output table CJ-155adequately reflects and captur es the higher submission of pa per applications in 2004 and 2005. In 2005, paper and electronic applicatio ns were accepted. In FY 2006, electronic submission was deemed mandatory by IHS. Training and technical assistance was provided by IHS to meet this need. However, the decrease in submissions is evident in the output table for years FY 2006, 2007 and 2008. It is anticipated that as the comfort level and familiarity increase for electronic submission that the numbers will gradually increase. The award amounts and number of grants aw arded by the TMG program varies annually based on the type of grant applications rece ived and determined fundable. Grants are awarded for single year or multi-year projects dependent upon the number, dollar amounts and type of fundable applications. New grant awards are awarded each year after the multi-year non-competing continua tion award funds are set aside for the previous year's multi-year grants.

In addition, Headquarters actively administers the Agency's accomplishment of the HHS strategic goals and activities, while simultaneously maintaining the special Tribal-Federal relationship based in treaty and law. The Headquarters operations are set forth by statute and administrative requirements by the Department of Health and Human Serv ices (DHHS), the Admi nistration, Congress, and field operations, i.e., 12 Area Offices a nd 163 Service Units. Headquarters actively works with the DHHS to formulate and implem ent national health care priorities, goals, and objectives. The IHS Headquarters conti nues to work with the Department to formulate a budget and necessary legislation. In addition, it responds to congressional inquiries, and interacts with other governmental entities to enhance and support health services for Indian people. The IHS headqua rters also formulates policy and distributes resources; provides general program directi on and oversight for IHS Areas and Service Units; provides technical expertise to all co mponents of the Indian health system, which includes IHS direct, Tribally operated programs, and urban Indian health programs (I/T/U); maintains national statistics; iden tifies trends; and projects future needs. The 12 Area Offices distribute resources, monitor and evaluate the full range of comprehensive health care and community orie nted public health programs, and provide technical support to IHS direct and Tribally-ope rated programs. They ensure the delivery of quality health care through the 163 Service Units and participate in the development and demonstration of alternative means and t echniques of health services management and CJ-158delivery to promote the optimal provision of h ealth services to Indi an people through the Indian health system. The budget funds Headquarters and 12 Area o ffices operations, and Tribal shares (as indicated by the table below). FY 2008 FY 2009 FY 2010 Enacted Omnibus PB budget s upports the leadership and ov erall management of the IHS to ensure effective support for the IHS mission. This includes oversight of financial, human, facilities, information and support resources and systems. Performance measurement is built into all oversight measures, both in program delivery and administrative support systems. Leadership and direction also includes specific focus on the HHS Performance Objectives. For FY 2010, IHS activities will continue to focus on GPRA and program assessment performance objectives. Significant activities include the establishm ent of performance plans that cascade throughout the agency and provide for performa nce accountability at all levels of the agency. The Direct Operations budget also supports leadership and oversight for the accomplishment of the performance measures that are included in the IHS FY 2009 Annual Performance Plan. The measures addr ess many of the administrative aspects of providing health care to AI /AN population and comply with the requirements of GPRA and other Departmental goals of achieving equi valent and improved he alth status for all Americans. In addition, management improve ments will be guided by the Department's Performance Objectives and the priorities of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Headquarters, through this activity, will contin ue to develop and expand its crosscutting collaborations and partnerships with other Fe deral agencies and outside organizations to meet many performance measures and object ives. A FY 2010 performance goal for Direct Operations is to continue the impleme ntation of a human capi tal strategy to assist managers with succession planning activities. Twenty-seven percent of IHS employees will be eligible for retirement in 2011. Enhancing the IHS workforce's knowledge and skills in areas such as financial management , entrepreneurship and the application of regulations has been identified as critical to meet the IHS' current and future needs to fulfilling the mission of the IHS.

Through enactment of P.L. 102-573, the Indian Health Care Amendments of 1992, authority to fund the Tr ibal SGDPs was extended to IH S and the Office of Tribal Self-Governance (OTSG) was established. Through enactment of P.L. 106-260, the Tribal Self-Governance Amendments of 2000, pe rmanent authority was given to Title V, Tribal Self-Governance. Since 1993, the IHS, with Tribal representa tives, has developed formula methodologies for identification of tribal shares for all I ndian Tribes. Tribal shares are those program and administrative funds that Tribes are e ligible for and can elect to take from Headquarters and Area organizational levels of the IHS. Currently, $1.843 billion of the IHS budget is under Tribal Health Administ ration of which approximately $1.242 billion will be transferred to tribes in support of Tribal Self-Governance with 125 compacts and 146 funding agreements in FY 2010. The remaining balance is used to administer Title I, Urban Health and Contract Support Costs. The Self-Governance budget supports a system of care implemented at the local level by Tribal governments through their Compact s and Funding Agreements. The Self- Governance budget further supports accomplishments through: Agency performance measure achievemen t through various Tribal pilot projects throughout the country which are funded through the Self-Governance budget; Funding for ambulances to all Indian tribes and tribal organizations; CJ-161 Funding for third party infrastructure demonstration projec t with a tribe; Funding to an Indian tribal organization to provide technical a ssistance, coordination of meeting dates, locations, etc. in development of a annual report to Congress; Funding of a pilot project to explore alternative methods for providing direct care services to individuals w ithin a three State area; Funding of Interagency Agreement between IHS and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to provide support and training to Community Health Representatives, first responders, modular curriculum development/online training, and specialty field training/support for suicide prevention and response. Therefore, Self-Governance does not directly control the assessment of these Tribal programs and services. It supports Tribal efforts to pursue their local goals through special programs, advocacy, technical assistance and administrative support. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2005 $5,586,000 2006 $5,668,000 2007 $5,763,000 2008 $5,836,000 2009 Recovery Act $0 2009 Omnibus $6,004,000 BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2010 budget request for Self-Governance is $6,066,000, an increase of $62,000 over the FY 2009 Omnibus level. This incr ease represents $53,000 for pay increases and $9,000 for inflation. The Self-Governance budget wi ll support the provision of technical assistance to approximately 392 federally recognized Indian tribes and tribal or ganizations compacted with the Indian Health Serv ice (IHS); fund up to 16 Indian Tribes with Planning and Negotiation Cooperative Agreements; continue to fund the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) projects; and address trib al shares funding needs in IHS Areas and Headquarters for any Indian tribe( s) newly entering self-governance . The total funding for Self-Governance will provide: $2.7 million (or 45 percent) for the operating budget of the OTSG; 12 FTEs, including payroll costs, tr avel, supplies, rents/comm unications and contractual services; reimbursement travel cost (other than OTSG staff), TDY's to the OTSG; planning and negotiation cooperative agreements. $3.3 million (or 55 percent) for a reserve f und, i.e. shortfalls; these funds were appropriated to fund shortfalls in cases wh ere there cannot be a direct transfer of funds from IHS to the Indian tribes to fund self-governance compacts without CJ-162jeopardizing the support provided by IHS to other Indian tribes. Therefore, the reserve funds are used for: (1) To ensure that funding of tribal sh ares under Self-Governance compacting does not adversely affect non-Self-Governance Tribes. These funds are provided directly to the Self-Govern ance Tribes or to Area Of fices and/or Headquarters programs and the OTSG so that Self-G overnance Tribes may receive their full funding of tribal shares as provided for in P.L. 106-260; (2) For Self-Governance costs incurred as the result of special circumstances: severance pays, Reduction In Force (RIF ) costs, settlements and assessments costs; assistance with the purchase of ambulances; assistance with incidents caused by natural disasters (e.g., mud slides caused by too much rain) (3) To support special projects that enhance Self-Governance Activities: Government Performance Results Act (GPRA) Projects; development of a curriculum to be used for the training of future Agency Lead Negotiators (ALN) within the IHS; Self-Governance Communication Education Tribal Consortium continued agreement; eligibility services project; EMS services; travel/logistics of Advisory committees, workgroups; other tr ainings; SG Report card; Educational Brochure on SG.

P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination contracts and compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) allows Tribes to assume operation of Federal programs and to receive not less than the amount of direct program funding that the Secretary would have otherwise provided for the direct operation of the program (speci fically, contract support costs were first identified in the 1988 amendments to the ISDEAA). In FY 2009, approximately $1.805 billion of the Agency's appropriation will be under Tribal Health Administration primarily through Title I and V of the ISDEAA. The ISDEAA also provides that contract support costs (CSC) be added to the program amount. The CSC are defined in the ISDEAA as the reasonable costs for activities either not nor mally provided by the Secretary in his/her direct operation of the program, or were pr ovided by the Secretary in support of the program from resources othe r than those under contract. Specific elements of CSC include are: Pre-award costs (e.g., consultant and proposal planning services). Start-up costs (e.g., purchase of administrati ve computer hardware and software). Direct CSC (e.g., unemployment taxe s on direct program salaries). Indirect CSC (e.g., pooled costs such as the support of a financial management system). The IHS CSC policy, in existence since 1992, governs the administration and allocation of CSC, and was developed through extensive consultation and partic ipation of Tribes. The most recent revision of the CSC Policy was in April 2007, and established it as a permanent Chapter within the IHS Manual (P art 6, Chapter 3, TN-2007-05), effective for the fiscal year (FY) 2007 through FY 2010 funding periods. CJ-165The revised policy modified the CSC allo cation methodology associated with new or expanded awards under the ISDEAA, P.L. 93-638, as amended. Allocations are now made at the average level of CSC funding pa id to all existing P.L. 93-638 awards. The IHS CSC policy conforms to applicable OMB Circular A-87 and A-122 cost principles. The IHS continues to review the soundness of its allocation policies concerning CSC and to take steps to assure that CSC provided to Tribes is reasonable and does not duplicate other funding provided to Tribes by the IH S under self-determination agreements. The IHS provides specific tech nical assistance to Tribes on calculating CSC and reviews each Tribal request that is submitted for CSC us ing a protocol to ensure that the CSC that are approved are consistent throughout the IHS system and not duplicative of other funding provided to Tribes. This ongoing review of CSC allocation policies and technical assistan ce ties in directly with HHS Strategic Goals and Objectiv es - FY 2007-2012 (Goal 1: Objective 1.3; Improve health care qualit y, safety, cost, and value. Since calendar year 2006, Tribally-operated health programs (TOHP) continue work to address follow-up recommendations from the findings of the TOHP program assessment. The CSC accounts for 16 percent of the total funding provided to TOHP, yet, is a key element of cost affecting the overall perfor mance of TOHP. TOHP received a rating of Adequate on the TOHP program assessment. Generally, this rati ng describes a program that needs to set more ambiti ous goals, achieve better results, improve accountability or strengthen its management practices. The TOHP program assessment found that TOHPs maintain or improve the overall health of American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) each year, as measured by independent evaluations and clinical indicators like screening rates for medical conditions. Most nota bly, the programs have reduced Years of Productive Life Lost by 11 percent over the past decade. However, performance information is only available for programs th at voluntarily report the data, or 76 percent of AI/ANs served in 2008. By law, the government cannot require Tribal programs to submit performance data (Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA) Public Law 93-638, as amended, Se ction 514). This restriction makes it difficult to identify deficiencies and assist Tribes in improving program performance. Tribes are also not required to inform the IHS of how much funding they receive from other sources, such as Medicare and Medicaid. As a result, it is difficult to determine the relationship between overall funding le vels and program performance. Finally, in continuing to manage CSC funding, and in response to the March, 2005 Supreme Court decision in Cherokee Nation v. Leavitt 1, the IHS has issued additional guidance concerning any new or expanded cont racts or compacts being entered into for FY 2007 and subsequent years. This guidan ce requires that Tribes and the IHS reach agreement concerning the unavailability of In dian Self-Determination (ISD)/CSC funding and the obligation of the IHS to fund CSC pur suant to the appropriations \"cap\" on CSC. If there is not agreement on the part of the Tribe then the new or expanded program request will likely be declined. These principles need to be adhered to in instances where 1 In Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma et. al. v. Leavitt, Secretary of Health and Human Services, et. al ., the Supreme Court ruled that the IHS had received an unrest ricted appropriation suffic ient to provide plaintiff Tribes full funding of their contract support cost requirements pursuant to their ISDEAA contracts with the Federal Government in fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997. CJ-166 CSC funding may not be availabl e in order for the IHS to en ter into new contracts or compacts under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. If the Tribe and the IHS could not re ach agreement, the proposal to contract for the new and expanded programs, services, functions, and activities (PSFA) would be declined.

Authorizing Legislation ............................... Economy Act of 31 U.S.C. 686 Section 301, P.L. 94-437, and Title IV of Indian Health Care Improvement Act. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS The collection of third party revenue is essent ial to maintaining facility accreditation and standards of health care through the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations or the Accreditation Associat ion for Ambulatory Health Care. Public and Private Collections are a significant part of the IHS and Tribal budgets, and support increased access to quality health care servi ces for American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN). Third party revenue represents up to 50 percent of operating budgets at many facilities. IHS has had legislative authority to bill Medicare and Medicaid (M&M) since 1976. Medicare/Medicaid -- The FY 2008 collections are ac tual results and the 2009 total is adjusted using the 2008 M & M rate increase . The FY 2010 collecti on estimates assume continuation of the FY 2009 colle ctions at this time. Comple ting cost reports to set the CY 2010 M&M rates is priority. During FY 2009 and FY 2010, IHS will continue to place a priority on development of a third party interface with the new Unified Financial Management System. The IHS focus will continue to strengthen business office policies and management practices, including internal controls, patient benefits coordi nation, provider documentation training, certified procedural coding training and electronic claims processing. Priority efforts include the continued development of modifications to third party billing a nd accounts receivable software to improve effectiveness and to en sure system integration with its business CJ-169processes and compliance with Health Insu rance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), National Provider ID and M&M regulations. As part of long term planning goals, during FY 2009 and FY 2010 IHS will be evaluating through GSA commercial off the shelf Practice Management Software for possible replacement of existing third party billing and accounts receivable software. IHS will continue to work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the State Medicaid agencies to improve eac h program's capability to identify patients who are eligible to enroll in M&M programs. IHS will also continue to work with the CMS and the Tribes on a number of issues, including third party coverage, claims processing, denials, training and documentation of services. The IHS places the highest priority on m eeting all accreditation standards for its healthcare facilities. The use of the M&M re imbursements will continue to be used to support and maintain facility accreditation a nd improve the delivery and access to health care for AI/AN people. Private Third Party Collection -- The FY 2009 and 2010 private insurance budget estimate remains at the FY 2008 collecti on level. During FY 2009 and FY 2010, IHS continues to enhance each health facility's capability to identify patients who have private insurance coverage, improve clai ms processing, provider documentation and coding that increases private insurance billing and collections. The local Service Units utilize the funds collected to improve services like the purchase of medical supplies and equipment. In addi tion, the funds will impr ove local service unit business management practices. The IHS continues to make use of private contractors to pursue collections on outstanding clai ms from private payers.

FY 2010 Authorization .................................................................................. through 2011 Allocation Method .....................................Grants, Interagency agreements, and Contracts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS Congress established the initial Special Diab etes Program for Indians (SDPI) through the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Support for the SDPI was augmented through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001, House Resolution 5738 of 2003, House Resolution 2764 of 2007 and House Resolution 6331 of 2008. As a result, the SDPI now operates with a budget of $150 million per year (through FY 2011). The IHS Division of Diabetes Treatment a nd Prevention (DDTP) provides leadership, programmatic, administrative and technical ov ersight to the SDPI grant program. The mission of the IHS DDTP is to develop, documen t, and sustain a public health effort to prevent and control diabetes in American In dians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs). This mission is accomplished by promoting collabo rative strategies for the prevention of diabetes and its complications to over 1.6 million AI/ANs through its extensive diabetes network. The diabetes network consists of a national program office; Area Diabetes Consultants in each of the 12 IHS Areas; 19 Model Diabetes programs in 23 different IHS and Tribal sites, and 333 local Commun ity-directed and 66 Demonstration Project IHS, Tribal and Urban Indian SDPI grant programs. The 66 SDPI demonstration grant programs, awarded in FY 2004, are comprised of 30 cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction demonstration projects and 36 di abetes prevention demonstration projects . This extensive diabetes network suppor ts the SDPI grant programs by providing comprehensive diabetes surveillance, research translation, promotion of quality assurance and improvement activities, technical support, resource and \"best practices\" information, CJ-172and develops and distributes American Indian specific diabetes education materials and training. This program also serves as the key IHS contact and source of information for outside organizations and agencies worki ng on diabetes and disparities related to diabetes. Now the most comprehensive rural system of care for diabetes in the U.S., the IHS combines both clinical and public health approaches to address the problem of diabetes and its complications. Target Audience Congress authorized the initia l SDPI appropriation in 1997 in response to alarming trends documenting a disproportionately high rate of type 2 diabetes in AI/AN communities. It came in the wake of increasing public con cern about the human and economic costs of diabetes in the U.S. and in particular for the growing disparity in prevalence between the AI/AN population and the US general population. AI/AN communities suffer a disproportionately high rate of type 2 diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) r ecently reported that, after adjusting for population age differences, national survey da ta (2004-2006) for people aged 20 years or older indicate that 6.6 percen t of non-Hispanic whites, 7.5 percent of Asian Americans, 10.4 percent of Hispanics, 11.8 percent of non-Hispanic blacks and 16.5 percent of AI/ANs had diagnosed diabetes. Diabetes is the fourth leading cause of death among AI/ANs, and the diabetes mortality rate among AI/ANs is three to four times that of non-AI/ANs. Heart disease, the leading cause of AI/AN mortality, appears to be more often fatal among AI/ANs than in other populations. In 2005, of AI/AN age 35 years or older with diabetes , nearly 70 percent had hypertension. Hypertension in people with di abetes, particularly if it is uncontrolled, significantly increases their likelihood of developing diabetes complications. In many tribal communities, the complications of diabetes lead to much higher incidence rates of blindness, vascular insufficiency leading to amputation, and kidney failure leading to dialysis than in the general U. S. population. In 2002, one in every four (24.8 percent) AI/AN elders over age 65 years had co ronary heart disease (or one of every five of those aged 55 and older). AI/ANs have the highest rate of premat ure deaths from heart disease of all races, with 36% of deaths from heart disease classified as premature; the rate is nearly 2.5 that for Whites. There has been some good news recently. Since 1999, the incidence of kidney failure leading to dialysis has declined 18 percen t among AI/AN population with diabetes over age 45 years (a 29 percent decrease was seen in those aged 45-64 years and a 13 percent decrease in those age 65 years and older). This improvement was seen despite the continued rise in diabetes pr evalence in the same time peri od, and was attributed to the reduction in risk factors and improvements in diabetes care practices in Indian communities as shown by our yearly IHS Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit. CJ-173Distribution Method In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress es tablished the SDPI to \"establish grants for the prevention and treatment of diabetes\" to address the growing problem of diabetes in AI/ANs. The entities eligible to receive these grants included IHS programs, tribes and tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations. The IHS distributed this funding to over 300 su ch entities according to legislative intent through a process that included a formal tribal consultation, development of a formula for distribution of the funds to eligible entit ies, and a formal grant application and administrative process. These programs were allowed to use this funding to design and carry out interventions that will best addr ess the problem of di abetes in individual communities. Depending on community needs, these programs incorporate a wide range of proven diabetes treatment and prevention st rategies, such as patient education, quality diabetes care services, as well as physical activity, nutrition and weight loss activities. $1 million was also set-aside for the CDC Na tive Diabetes Wellness Program (formerly known as the National Diabet es Prevention Center). Special Diabetes Program for Indians - Total Yearly Costs 2004-2011 CATEGORY (Dollars in Millions) Original Diabetes Grants - now called Community-directed Di abetes Programs (297 Tribal and IHS grants 1998) $104.8 Administration of Community-directed SDPI grants ( Includes administrative funds to IHS Areas, Tribal Leaders Diabetes Committee, Di v of Diabetes, Grants Operations, evaluation support contracts, etc.) 4.1 Urban Indian Health Program community-directed diabetes programs (36 grants) 7.5 Demonstration Projects (66 grants) 23.3 Administration of Demonstration Project Diabetes Grants ( Includes administrative funds 1) to support the limited dissemination activities, 2) to HQ, 3) to s upport contracts, etc.) 0.9 Demonstration Project Coordinating Center 3.2 Funds to strengthen the Data Infrastructure of IHS 5.2 Native Diabetes Wellness Center (CDC) 1.0 TOTAL: $150.0 Strategy The SDPI has brought Tribes together over these past 12 years, working toward a common purpose and sharing information and lessons learned along the way. The IHS has shown through its public he alth evaluation activities that these programs have been very successful in improving diabetes care a nd outcomes, as well as the start of primary prevention efforts, on reservations and in urban clinics. Tribes and urban Indian organi zations have had to make choices about how to best use their local SDPI funding to address the probl em of diabetes in AI/AN communities. A study published by the American Diabetes A ssociation in 2007 on the economic burden of diabetes in the U.S., estimated that it costs $11,744 per year to care for one person with diabetes compared with $5,095 per year for persons without diabetes. A recent IHS analysis, supported by th e SDPI, demonstrated that in th e Indian health system it costs $7,003 per year to care for an AI/AN person with diabetes comp ared with $2,205 for a CJ-174AI/AN person without diabetes, a three-fold difference. Among AI/ANs with diabetes, those who also have CVD cost $12,693 per year , a two-fold increase. Early on in the SDPI program the Indian health care system recognized that it would have to make careful choices about where to invest these funds and knew these choices would best be made locally. Our evaluation of SDPI and di abetes clinical measures suggests that population-level diabetes-related health is better among our AI/AN patients since the implementation of SDPI. The greatest benefit for AI/ANs with diabetes has likely been in the reduction in microvascular complications due to improve ment in hyperglycemia. Further reducing microvascular and macrovascular complications will require continued efforts to improve glucose, blood pressure and c holesterol values. However, the greatest long-term benefit will most likely be from the diabetes pr imary prevention activities now becoming commonplace in AI/AN communities. Demonstration Projects In FY 2004 the IHS, in response to Congressi onal direction, developed and implemented a SDPI competitive Demonstration Project. The focus of the competitive Demonstration Project is on: 1) primary prevention of type 2 diabetes in those adults at risk for developing diabetes and 2) reduction of cardi ovascular risk in AI /AN adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Sixty-si x grants were awarded and this 5-year project was launched in November 2004. These Demonstration Pr ojects were not designed to conduct new research. Rather, they were designed to transl ate findings from scien tific studies into the \"real world settings\" of AI/AN communitie s and their health care systems. Preliminary results from these Demonstrati on Projects are promising. When the rigorous evaluation and analysis of th e SDPI Demonstration Projects is complete in FY 2010, the IHS will better understand how best to impl ement the successful interventions in the diverse settings of AI/AN communities. Strengthening the Diabetes Data Infrastructure The IHS has used administrative funding from the SDPI to strengthen the diabetes data infrastructure of the Indian health sy stem by improving diabetes surveillance and evaluation capabilities. These funds also support the development and implementation of the IHS Electronic Health Reco rd, the electronic patient a nd data management system used in many Indian health facilities. As a result of these data infrastructure improvements, the Indian health system ha s been better able to identify and track American Indians and Alaska Natives with diabetes. This improvement in diabetes surveillance will allow for the measurement of the long-term outcomes of age-specific prevalence of diabetes and of CVD in people with diagnosed diabetes. Technical assistance, provid er networks, clinical mon itoring and grant evaluation activities at the Headquarters and Area office levels have also been strengthened. In addition, support for the Area Diabetes cons ultants, who serve a crucial role in coordinating these functions at the Area level, was made stronger. SDPI funding for the past 11 years has served to build and enhan ce a much-needed infrastructure within local CJ-175IHS and Tribal administrations that enables continued development of diabetes programs to address treatment and prevention of diab etes, as well as obesity and other chronic diseases. Milestones accomplished and cha llenges faced during current year The SDPI provides funding for diabetes treatment and prevention services in 399 Tribal, IHS and urban Indian Health programs. Year ly SDPI grantee assessments are conducted within the yearly SDPI Progress Report. These assessments have shown significant improvements in care and community services provided over time when compared to the baseline SDPI assessment in 1997, as evidenced by: Improved Elements of Diabetes Care: 68 percent more grant programs have diab etes teams - health professionals who work together to provide diabetes care. 36 percent more grant programs have diabetes clinics that offer special medical appointments for people with diabetes. 65 percent more grant programs use a diabet es registry to keep track of people with diabetes in their communities. Promoting Healthy Lifestyles: 57 percent more grant programs offe r nutrition services for adults. 38 percent more grant programs have access to a registered dietitian. 72 percent more grant programs offer co mmunity walking and running programs. 53 percent more grant programs have a physical activ ity specialist. Addressing the threat of childhood obesity and diabetes: 76 percent more grant programs have type 2 diabetes preven tion programs for youth. 29 percent more grant programs offer nut rition services for children and youth. 69 percent more grant programs have community-based physical activity programs. 52 percent more grant programs have sa fe environments for physical activity. Efforts to Support Behavior Change: 71 percent more grant programs offer or ganized diabetes education activities. 56 percent more grant programs offer cult urally-appropriate di abetes education. 55 percent more grant programs work with social service programs. Greater availability of depression screening and a variety of therapies to help patients cope with stress and depression. Weight Management Activities. 65 percent more grant programs offer adult weight management programs. CJ-176 64 percent more grant programs offer we ight management programs for children and youth. AI/AN communities have used SDPI funds to make quality diabetes practices common place in local heal th facilities. Key Clinical Outcome Measures Have Improved: The mean long-term blood sugar control le vel (A1C) overall decreased 12 percent from A1C=9.00 percent (1996) to A1C=7.93 percent (2008). The incidence of new cases of kidney failure leading to dialysis among AI/AN has declined 18 percent for the en tire adult diabetic population: - 29 percent decrease in those aged 45-64 years - 13 percent decrease in those aged 65 years and older The mean LDL cholesterol level decreas ed 19 percent from 118 mg/dl (1996) to 95.3 mg/dl (2008). Building Programs Based on Best Practices. There are 18 IHS Diabetes Best Practice Models that focus on successful diabetes pr evention, treatment and education practices that have been shown to be successful in AI/AN communities. These Best Practices are based on findings from the latest diabetes scientific research, evidence-based outcomes studies, and the extensive experi ence of Indian health profe ssionals. The best practice models have been used by SDPI applicants to identify strengths in diabetes resources and services in their communities, find gaps in diabetes services or programs, establish program priorities, find best practice models that could be applied within their own communities, and to begin a work plan to develop their own local best practice models. Tribal Consultation. The Tribal Leaders Diabetes Committee, established in 1998, continues to meet several times each year at the direction of the IH S Director to review information on the progress of the SDPI activiti es and to provide recommendations to the Director of IHS on diabetes-related issues pertinent to AIAN, as well as to CDC and NIH-NIDDK. Strengthen IHS Data infrastructure. SDPI funds support the development and implementation of the IHS Electronic Health Record and the IHS Diabetes Management System (a software program that is part of the RPMS system) in all 12 Areas of the IHS and, as a result, the Indian Health system ha s been better able to identify and track AIAN with diabetes and improve clinical services. SDPI Grant Program Evaluation. The CDC's Framework for Public Health Evaluation , provides a framework for ongoing analysis of the SDPI Community-directed grant programs. In addition, the IHS is conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the SDPI Targeted Demonstration Projects to an swer questions on program effectiveness and outcomes based on solid, statistically accurate , and timely data. Preliminary analyses reveal: CJ-177Diabetes Prevention Demonstration Project : As of December 31, 2008, 36 programs have recruited 3451 participants with pre-diabet es to receive education to promote weight loss through increased physical activity and reducing fat gram s and calories in their diets with a modified version of the 16-session Di abetes Prevention Program Curriculum. Of these participants, 2878 completed both th e baseline and follow-up assessments, providing data to assess of whether key c linical characteristics had improved after completing the 16-session Diabetes Prevention Program curriculum. As of December 31, 2008, the average weight loss of participan ts was 8.6 Lbs which represented a 3.9 % reduction from baseline for the group mean. Bo th systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased by 0.7% on average and HDL increa sed by 2.3% from baseline (both represent an improvement). Average fasting blood gluc ose decreased by 3.3 percent from baseline to follow-up. Other clinical indicators showed similar improvements. The percent of participants who met the progr am goal of more than 150 minutes per week of physical activity increased from 23 percent at baseline to 55 percent at follow up. Healthy Heart Demonstration Project : As of December 31, 2008, 30 programs have recruited 3564 participants with diabetes to pa rticipate in an intensive, clinic-based case management approach to reduce their risk f actors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Of these participants, 2799 completed baseline and first annual follow-up assessments. The primary outcomes that are assessed at the a nnual assessment include reduction in blood pressure, changes in HbA1C and lipids, aspi rin use, increased physical activity, nutrition, weight loss, and less smoking. As of December 31, 2008, the overall group showed improvements in almost all cardiovascular disease risk factors. For example, the percentage of participants meeting the LDL goal (< 100 mg/dl) improved by about 10% from baseline (54%) to both annual assessm ents (65% and 66% for 1st and 2nd annual respectively). The percentage meeting th e blood pressure goals showed similar improvements. Furthermore, the percent of participants taking daily aspirin increased by more than 10% from baseline (71%) to both annual assessments (84% and 85% respectively). The percent of participan ts who met the goal of >= 150 minutes of physical activity per week also increased signi ficantly from baseline (27%) to 1st annual (37%) and 2nd annual assessment (45%). A dditionally, participants reported eating healthy foods more often and unhealthy food less often at both annual assessments comparing to baseline. Tribal Management of Local Grant Programs. Eighty-one percent of the SDPI Community-directed Diabetes Pr ograms are Tribal programs. Collaborations and Partnerships. The IHS has developed and built upon collaborations and partnerships with federal and private organizations resulting from the SDPI. These include: Joslin Vision Network (JVN) Tele-ophthalmology Project; NIDDK/CDC/TLDC/Tribal Colle ges collaboration on the Diabetes Education in Tribal Schools project; National Indian Health Board (NIHB); Tribal Epidemiology Centers; CJ-178 National Congress of American Indians and Native American Boys and Girls Clubs; Head Start Bureau; Committee on Native American Child Health (CONACH); American Diabetes Association; Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF); American Indian Higher Education Consortium; CDC's State Diabetes Control Programs; National Diabetes Education Program (NDEP) Challenges In its entire history, the IHS had never b een faced with creating and managing such a large grant program. In response to this challenge, the IHS DDTP has mobilized an extensive network to undertake one of the most strategic and concerted diabetes treatment and prevention efforts to date and have dem onstrated the ability to design, manage and measure a complex, long-term project to address this chronic condition. Despite the progress made, si gnificant diabetes-related challenges remain in AI/AN communities such as: Significant number of vacanci es for professional health care positions hinders staffing of programs especially in rural areas. Finding adequate space to set-up prog rams and conduct program activities. Being located in remote areas making acce ss to clinical serv ices a significant challenge. Additional needs for training a nd technical assistance for o Grant writing and planning. o Assessment and planning at the community level. o Grant program management and leadership skills. o Grant program evaluation - statistics, da ta analysis and research on program impacts and outcomes. o Implementing diabetes prevention strategi es that have been proven to work o Implementing prevention of diabetes comp lications strategies that are known to work.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS Maintenance and Improvement (M&I) supports the maintenance and improvement of IHS and Tribal health care facilities which ar e used to deliver health care services. The HHS and IHS are committed to sustaining the real property necessary to meet the mission and goals of the IHS. This request also moves towards a strategy of improving the condition of IHS health care facilit ies to condition standards set by HHS. The IHS supports M&I activities in Federal, government-owned buildings and in Tribally-owned space where it is used to provi de health care services pursuant to contract or compact arrangements executed under the provisions of the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act (P.L. 93-638). M&I funds are to support and enhance the delivery of health care and prev entive health services and to safeguard interests in real property. Maintaining reliable and efficien t buildings is increasingly challenging as existing facilities age and additional space is added into the real property inventory. Annual health care space supported with M&I funds: FY Supported Space (Square Meters) 2005 objectives (1) provi ding routine maintenance and repairs for facilities; (2) achieving compliance with build ings and grounds accreditation standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Heal thcare Organizations or other applicable accreditation bodies; (3) providing improvements to facilities for enhanced patient care; (4) ensuring that health care facilities meet building codes and standards; and (5) ensuring compliance with executive orders and public laws relative to building requirements, e.g., energy conservation, seismic, environmental, handicapped accessibility, and security. The accreditation of facilities demonstrates the high level of quality of services being provided to American Indian and Alaska Native communities. In 2008, all IHS and Tribally-operated hospitals were accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) or certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Also, most large clinics and many smaller clinics were accredited by JCAHO or the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, and most youth regional treatment facilities we re either accredited by JCAHO or the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities. An essential component of these accredita tion standards is a viable and proactive maintenance and repair operation with adequa te funding levels. F acilities Engineering Program Plans (FEPPs) establish annual M&I workload targets and help determine the most prudent use of available resources. FEPPs are prepared by IHS Area Offices, service units, and Tribal programs to identify delineate, and plan facilities related activities and projects to be accomplished during the upcoming fiscal year with M&I funds. Funds in the M&I line item account ar e used primarily to maintain and improve health care facilities and are identified for allocation as routine maintenance and project funds. Staff quarters operation, maintenan ce, and improvement costs are primarily funded with rent collections cal led Quarters Return (QR) funds. M&I funds may be used in conjunction with QR funds at locations with few quarters or where QR funds are insufficient to ensure appropriate quarters ma intenance. New Executive Orders on asset management and environmental management rela ted to facilities may affect the cost of facilities operations. Status of Facilities The physical condition of IHS-owned and many Tribally-owned facilities is evaluated through annual general surveys conducted by local facility pe rsonnel and IHS Area Office engineers. In addition, comprehens ive facility condition surveys are conducted every five years by a team of engineer s and architects or other specialists. These surveys, together with routine obs ervations by facilities personnel, identify deficiencies that are included in the Backl og of Essential Maintenance, Alterations, and Repair (BEMAR) database. The identif ied BEMAR for IHS and reporting Tribal facilities as of April 24, 2009 was $476,052,000. The following table summarizes the BEMAR by category: CJ-187BEMAR 1 PUBLIC LAW Life Safety Compliance ........................................................................$20,681,000 General Safety .........................................................................................14,675,000 Environmental Compliance 2...................................................................13,860,000 Handicapped Compliance ........................................................................13,846,000 Energy Conservation ...............................................................................26,135,000 Seismic Mitigation 3................................................................................ 50,862,000 Sub Total...........................................................................................$140,059,000 IMPROVEMENTS Patient Care............................................................................................$92,544,000 Program Deficiencies............................................................................... 43,414,000 Sub Total.............................................................................................$135,958,000 MAINTENANCE & REPAIR 4 M&R $476,052,000 1 The M&I allocation will be distributed for routine maintenance and for projects; projects are intended to reduce identified BEMAR deficiencies. 2 These types of projects include air quality improvement, asbestos remediation, lead-based paint, and contaminated soil remediation. 3 The Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program Act require d IHS to survey and estim ate the cost associated with compliance to seismic construction standards. This survey was completed in the fall of 1998 and added $149,127,000 in seismic deficiencies. Since that time some seismic deficiencies have been corrected as part of larger projects, thus reducing the backlog. 4 Staff quarters operation, maintenance, and improv ement costs are funded through rents collected, called Quarters Return (QR) funds. The M&I funds may be used in conjunction with QR funds at locations where QR funds are insufficient to ensure appropriate quarters maintenance. CJ-188The IHS and tribes conduct detailed facility assessments to identify deficiencies that ma ke up the Backlog of Essential Maintenance, Alteration, and Repair (BEMAR). To identify potential projects for the Recov ery Act, a substantial number of new deficiencies were identified in both tribally and federally owned facilities that increased overall BEMAR. For IHS and reporting tribal facilities, BEMAR is $476,052,000 as of April 24, 2009. Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, $100 million was appropriated to the M&I activities, not all of which are BEMAR related. As the result of these funds, anticipate that BEMAR will be reduced by an estimated $80 million at Federal and tribal facilities. More details will be available on Recovery.gov. M&I Funds Allocation Method The IHS M&I funds are allocated in four categories: routine maintenance, M&I projects, environmental compliance, and demolition: Routine Maintenance Funds - Amounts are calculated us ing the IHS M& I distribution formula, which is based on the modified University of Oklahoma methodology to calculate routine maintenan ce costs. Routine M&I funds can be used to pay non- personnel costs for the followi ng activities in IHS and Tribally-owned health care facilities: emergency repairs, preventive ma intenance activities, maintenance supplies and materials, building service equipment replacement, upkeep activities, training, and local projects. These funds support f acilities activities that are ge nerally classified as those needed for 'sustainment' of the existing facilities. In FY 2009, approximately $47 million, identified as M&I routine maintenan ce, was provided to the IHS Area Offices and Tribes for daily maintenance activities and local projects to maintain the current state of health care facilities. The Building Research Board of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) (Committing to the Cost of Ownersh ip - Maintenance and Repair of Public Buildings, 1990 ) has determined that approximately two to four percent of current replacement value of supported bu ildings is required to mainta in (i.e., 'sustain') facilities in their current condition. The current IHS investment strategy fully funds sustainment to maintain the facilities in their current condition. M&I Project Funds - IHS Area Office Facilities Engi neers develop priority lists of larger projects to reduce the BEMAR. Alt hough Tribes with Tribally-owned facilities may take their individual shares of the M&I project pool funds, for those Tribes located in Areas with a Federal facility inventory, M&I project pool funds may be restricted for Federal facilities to ensure that Federal stewardship responsibili ties are maintained. Generally M&I projects in this category requi re levels of expertis e, which may not be available at the local facility. Such projec ts accomplish major repairs and improvements of primary mechanical, electrical, and othe r building systems as well as public law compliance and program-related alterations. Program-related altera tion projects include changes to existing facilities for more e fficient utilization, for new patient care CJ-189equipment, and to accommodate new treatment methodologies. In FY 2009, approximately $3.8 million, identified as M&I project, was provided to the IHS Area Offices and Tribes for projects to reduce the BEMAR deficiencies and to improve healthcare facilities to meet changing healthcare delivery needs. The Healthcare Financial Management Association published the findings of a study that found that in the commercial (non-government) healthcare sector, hospitals sp end an average of approximately five percent of a facility's value each year on restoration and modernization to maintain a reasonabl e backlog of maintenance and repair. Environmental Compliance Funds - The IHS places a high priority on the implementation of the Greening the Government Executive Orders and meeting Federal, State, and local legal/regulatory envir onmental requirements, including allocating funding to address findings and recommendations from environmental audits. Many IHS and Tribal facilities were c onstructed before the existence of current environmental laws and regulations. Since IHS is required to comply with current Federal, State, and local environmental regulations, the use of environm ental assessments to identify and evaluate potential environmental hazards is important. These assessments form the basis of the IHS facilities environmental remediation activ ities. The IHS has currently identified approximately $14 million in environmental compliance tasks and included them in the BEMAR database. Tribally-owned health care facilities receive assessments upon request by a Tribe. Demolition Funds - The IHS has a number of Federally-owned buildings that are vacant, excess, or obsolete which are no longer need ed. The number currently is estimated at over 100 buildings. Many of these buildings are safety and security hazards. Demolition of some of these buildings, in concert w ith transferring others, reduces hazards and liability. Demolition Fund may be augmented with environmental compliance funds as available for demolition of the Federal buildings to the extent that the proposed action reduces hazards, environmental concerns, or liability to the Indian Health Service.

There ar e no FTE's associated with this program. This level of funding will assi st the IHS in meeting the re al property asset management requirements and goals as outlined in the Executive Order 13327, Federal Real Property Asset Management; Executive Order 13423, Strengthen Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management; and Energy Independence and Secu rity Act of 2007; CJ-190with the end product of improving the condition of existing facilities by eliminating the maintenance and repair backlog, demolition of excess buildings, and thereby raising the Condition Index. The requested funding will also aid in improving the efficiency of IHS and tribal facilities and addressing the most frequently c ited area for improvement, which is the physical plant safety and efficiency. The average age of IHS health care facilities is greater than 30 years. The total funding for M&I may provide: Approximately $49.4 million as M&I routine maintenance. Approximately $1 million identified as M&I project 1 provided to the IHS Area Offices and Tribes for projects to reduce the BEMAR deficiencies and to improve healthcare facilities' Condition Index (C I) to meet changing healthcare delivery needs. Approximately $3 million for environmental compliance projects and approximately $500,000 for demolition projects. Under the American Recovery and Reinvest ment Act, $100 million was appropriated to the M&I activities. As the result of thes e funds, anticipate that BEMAR will be reduced by an estimated $80 million at Federal and tribal facilities. OUTCOMES Program has no outcomes.

Allocation Method .................. Direct Federal, P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts, Memorandum of Agreements, and Self-Governance Compacts. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS Sanitation Facilities Construction (SFC) is an integral component of the IHS disease prevention activity. The Indian Health Serv ice (IHS) has carried out the program since 1959 using funds appropriated for SFC to provide potable water and waste disposal facilities for AI/AN people. As a result, the rates for infant mortality, the mortality rate for gastroenteritis and other environmentally -related diseases have been dramatically reduced, by about 80 percent since 1973. The IHS physicians and health professionals credit many of these health status improvements to IHS' provision of water supplies, sewage disposal facilities, de velopment of solid waste sites, and provision of technical assistance to Indian water a nd sewer utility organizations. The four types of sanitation facilities projects funded thr ough IHS are (1) projects to serve new or like-new housing, such as Indian homes being constructed or rehabilitated by the BIA-Home Improvement Program (HIP), Tribes, individual homeowners, or other nonprofit organizations, (2) projects to serv e existing housing, (3 ) special projects (studies, training, or other needs related to sanitation facilitie s construction), and (4) emergency projects. Projects that serv e new or like-new housing are funded based on a priority classification system. Project s that serve existing housing are annually prioritized with Tribal input in terms of health impact, cost effectiveness and other criteria, then funded in priority order. Sanitation facilities projects are carried out cooperatively with the tribes who are to be served by the facilities. Tr ibal involvement has been th e keystone of the Sanitation Facilities Program since its in ception in FY 1959. Projects start with a Tribal Project Proposal and are funded through execution of an agreement between the Tribe and IHS. CJ-192In these agreements the Tribes agree to assume ownership respons ibilities, including operation and maintenance. SFC projects can be managed by the IHS dir ectly (Direct Service) or they can be managed by Tribes that elect to use Title I or Title V authorization under P.L. 93-638, the Indian Self-Determination and Educati on Assistance Act. The overall SFC goals, eligibility criteria, a nd project funding priorities remain the same, regardless of the delivery methods chosen by a Tribe. The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (Ti tle III, Section 302(g) 1 and 2 of P.L. 94- 437) directed the IHS to identify the univers e of Indian sanitation facilities needs for existing Indian homes. As of April 24, 2009, th e list of all document ed projects totaled almost $3 billion with those projects consid ered economically and technically feasible totaling almost $1.7 billion. Typically, it's thos e projects with exceptionally high capital costs that are considered economically inf easible if their cost per home exceeds an established allowable unit cost per home for a particular geographical area. Technical feasibility relates to ope rability and sustainability of the proposed system. As of the end of FY 2008, there were about 220,000 AI/AN homes in need of sanitation facilities, including nearly 35,000 AI/AN ho mes without potable water. The current backlog of projects would provide sanitation facilities to between 95 and 98 percent of all existing Indian homes. Also included in the backlog are projects intended to upgrade existing water supply and waste disposal facilities and projects to improve sanitation facilities operation and maintenance capabilities in Indi an country. Maximum health benefits will be rea lized by addressing existing sani tation needs identified in the backlog and by providing sanitation facilities for new homes when they are constructed. With completion of all projects ap proved through FY 2008, approximately 300,000 AI/AN homes will have been provided sanita tion facilities since 1960. Experience shows that 60 to 70 percent of th e actual construction is performed by Indian Tribes/firms. The SFC program is a contributing factor in accomplishing the goals of the IHS Strategic Plan including: Goal 1: Build and Sustai n Healthy Communities: Objective 1.2) Develop public health infrastructure with Tribes to sustain and support AI/AN communities. The SFC Program also supports the HHS St rategic Objective(s) 2.1: Preventing the spread of infectious diseases, 2.2: Pr otecting the public ag ainst injuries and environmental threats, and 2.4 Preparing fo r and responding to natural and man-made disasters. SFC projects provide resour ces for building and sustaining healthy communities through disease prevention; ach ieving parity in access by attempting to increase the number of AI/AN homes with potable water to 94 percent by 2015; providing compassionate quality health care through the provision of sanitation; and embracing innovation through prevention activities and increased partnerships with other federal agencies, states and tribes. Safe drinking water supplies and adequate waste disposal facilities are essential preconditi ons for most health promotion and disease prevention efforts, as well as being a major fact or in the quality of life of Indian people. In FY 2008, the IHS provided service to 21,811 homes, which exceeds the performance target: to provide san itation facilities proj ects to serve 21,800 AI/ AN new or like-new and existing homes with water, sewa ge disposal, and/or solid wast e water facilities. The SFC CJ-193program has exceeded all Government Perf ormance and Results Act (GPRA), IHS, Departmental and Program assessment performance measures. In FY 2009, of the $95,857,000 appropriated for sanitation facilities, $47,500,000 will be used to address the backlog of existing ho mes. This included funding to serve solid waste needs identified on the Sanitation Deficiency System (SDS) 1 (included in the solid waste funding was approximately $500,000 to clean up open dumps evaluated by an interagency task force, the members of which included the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Agricu lture and others). The remainder of the FY 2009 appropri ation was used to provide $47,357,000 for sanitation facilities for new/like-new Indi an homes and $1,000,000 for special projects, and emergency projects. In addition th e SFC Program was appropriated $68,000,000 in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Ac t (ARRA) which was also used to provide essential sanitation f acilities to the backlog of existing homes. The ARRA funds will fund projects of the Sanitation Deficiency Sy stem(SDS) list in the same manner as other projects are funded off SDS. The CJ states this as \"In addition the SFC Program was appropriated $68,000,000 in ...ARRA... which was also used to provide essential sanitation facilities to the backlog of existi ng homes.\" We do not expect any impact on the 2010 measures because any additional homes served will impact the 2009 measures and the durations should not be impacted until after 2011. More detail will be available on Recovery.gov. In cooperation with the Office of Manage ment and Budget (OMB) a Common Measure was developed in 2002 with the Rural Utility Service (RUS), the Bu reau of Reclamation (BOR), the EPA, and the IHS to allow direct comparisons between rural water programs within the federal government. The Comm on Measures agreed upon were the number of connections and the population served per millio n dollars of total project cost. It was recognized that BOR and IHS are direct se rvice programs to a sp ecific population, and EPA and RUS are grant/loan programs that can leverage funding with both of these programs mostly providing stri ctly upgraded services. SFC has leveraged its project funds yearly gaining up to 100 percent in ma tching projects contributions from other federal (EPA, RUS), state, tribal, and local entities. The IHS compared favorably in the OMB common measure of direct comparisons between federal ru ral water programs by servicing more than seven times the numb er of homes per dollar of funding than comparable programs. An efficiency measure based on the average pr oject duration is eval uating SFC expertise in advancing project discipline . For Sanitation Facilities Construction projects completed during Calendar 2011 and the years thereafter, the average project duration from the execution of the Project Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to the Construction Completion date as tracked by the Sanitation Fa cilities Project Data System shall be at 4 years or less. Project duration or the average length of time to complete project construction from the time the project is f unded is a measure of actual performance since project schedule is under a project manager's control. This time length has been slowly increasing from 2.5 years in 1993 to over 4 years at the end of 2007. Several factors have 1 The sanitation Deficiency System (SDS) is an inventor y of the sanitation deficiencies of American Indian and Alaska Native communities; those sanitation deficien cies include needed water, sewer, and solid waste facilities for existing American Indian and Alaska Native homes. CJ-194contributed to this growth in project duration including increased administrative requirements, more involved environmental revi ews, increased complexity of designs and decreases in staff resources. It is expected that the project duration will increase to at least 4.3 years prior to return ing to 4 years. Reversing this trend is a protracted undertaking marked by gradual progress due to the sheer number of existing projects already underway, many of which already have durations in excess of four years. All reductions in the length of time a project take s to complete will yield cost savings in both construction inflation costs and project related staffing costs. Based on the FY 2008 data, 10% of AI/AN homes are without a safe and reliable water supply. A marginal cost analysis for th e SFC Program was requested by the OMB in conjunction with OMB A-11, Section 221, Budge t and Performance Integration. The OMB approved the analysis and its findings in June of 2006. The marginal cost estimates related the level of SFC funding to the percent of AI/AN homes with potable water for a ten year period. According to the marginal co st curves the SFC funding would need to be increased to raise the percent of AI/AN homes that have access to safe drinking water. The marginal cost analysis for the SFC Pr ogram recommendations validated the existing IHS strategic goal and Program assessment goal for the SFC Program to increase the number of AI/AN homes with potable water to 94 percent by 2015. The Tribes through tribal consultation, other fe deral agencies through the Johannesburg MOU, and EPA within their strategic plan are all committed to SFC long term strategic goal. The marginal cost estimates related the level of SFC funding to the percent of AI/AN homes with potable water for a 10-year period. FUNDING HISTORY Fiscal Year Amount 2005 $91,767,000 2006 $94,003,000 2007 $94,253,000 2008 $94,253,000 2009 Recovery Act $68,000,000 2009 Omnibus $95,857,000 CJ-195BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2010 budget request for Sanitation F acilities Construction is $95,857,000, which is equal to the FY 2009 Omnibus level. Th e budget request for Sa nitation Facilities Construction supports essential sanitation facilities including wate r supply, sewage, and solid waste disposal facilities to American Indian/ Alaska Native (AI/AN) homes and communities. The SFC Program is a preventa tive health program that yields positive benefits in excess of the program costs. This level of funding will be allocated as follows, with pr ojects budgeted to include full costs for pre-planning, design, construction costs, and associated overhead: 1) $1,500,000 will be reserved at IHS Headquart ers for special projects and for distribution to the Areas as needed to address water supply and waste disposal emergencies caused by natural disasters or ot her unanticipated situ ations that require immediate attention to minimize potential th reats to public health. Emergency and special funds remaining at the end of the fisc al year will be dist ributed to the Areas to address the priority lis t of needs. The addition al $500,000 is for funding special projects in 3 Areas a year to collect homeowner data and other demographic information to strengthen verification mechanisms within the SFC Community Deficiency Profiles (CDP) in an effort to increase transparency, accuracy, and accountability of the CDP data. This data initiative will be funded over 4 years to collect this data in all twelve IHS Areas. 2) Approximately $47,000,000 of the total FY 2010 SFC appropriation will be reserved to serve new and like-new homes. Some of these funds may also be used for sanitation facilities for the individual homes of the disabl ed or sick with a physician referral indicating an immediate medical need for adequate sanitation facilities in their home. As needed, amounts to serve new and like-new homes will be established by Headquarters afte r reviewing Area requests. Priority will be given to projects intended to provide sanitation facilities for the first time to homes in categories B, C, and D (new homes and homes receiving major renovation bringing the homes up to like new condition) under the BIA Housing Improvement Program (HIP). (NOTE: Homes in BIA/HIP Cate gory A are considered existing homes. Category A homes needing service will be included in the SDS.) The amount allocated to each Area for projec ts to serve other new/like-new homes will be the Area's pro-rata share of rema ining funds for serving such housing. 3) Approximately $48,000,000 of the amount appropriated in FY 2010 will be distributed to the Areas for prioritized pr ojects to serve existing homes, based on a formula that considers, among other factors, the cost of facili ties to serve existing homes that: (a) have not rece ived sanitation facilities for the first time; or (b) are served by substandard sanitati on facilities (water and/or sewer). Another distribution formula element is a weight factor that favors Areas with larger numbers of American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/ AN) homes without water supply or sewer facilities, or without both. Up to $5,000,000 w ill be used for projects to clean up and replace open dumps on Indian lands pursuant to the Indian Lands Open Dump Cleanup Act of 1994. CJ-196The IHS appropriated funds will not be used to provide sanitation facilities for new homes funded with grants by the housing pr ograms of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (DHUD). These DHUD h ousing grant programs for new homes should incorporate funding for the sanitation facilities necessary for the homes.

Authorizing Legislation......................................25 U.S.C. 13, Snyder Act, P.L. 83-568, Transfer Act 42 U.S.C. 2001; and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, P.L. 94-437, as amended. CJ-198FY 2010 Authorization .......................................................................................Indefinite Allocation Method..............Direct Federal, P.L.93-638 Self-Determination Contracts, and Self-Governance Compacts PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AN D ACCOMPLISHMENTS Purpose - The IHS Health Care Facilities Cons truction (HCFC) funds are to provide optimum availability of functiona l, modern IHS and tribally ope rated health care facilities and, where no suitable housing alternative is av ailable, staff housing that offer access to the IHS health care delivery system. Th e IHS capital improvement program, funded through this budget activit y, is authorized to construct he alth care facilities and staff quarters; renovate/construct Youth Regional Treatment Centers for substance abuse; support tribal construction of facilities unde r the Joint Venture Construction Program; provide construction funding for Tribal sma ll ambulatory care facili ties projects; and provide funding to replace or provide new and replacement dental units. Pursuant to the Indian Health Care Impr ovement Act (IHCIA), Public Law (P.L.) 94-437, as amended in 1992, the need for each health car e facility and staff quarters construction project is assessed th rough a periodic appl ication of comprehens ive priority system methodologies. The proposals are evaluated objectively and ranked according to need. To determine the locations where new and replacement facilities are most critically needed, the IHS has developed comprehensive priority system methodologies for health care facilities and staff quarters construction. The IHS Headquarters periodically solicits from the IHS Areas proposals for urgently needed new or replacement health care facilities, essential staff quarters projects, and replacement/new dental units. These proposals are evaluated and ranked. Program justification documents are prepared for those scoring highest. Once justified and approved, projects are placed on the appropriate construction priority list and proposed for funding in the order in which planning documents are approve d and progress is achieved. History - During FY 1990, in consultation with th e Tribes, the IHS re vised its Health Facilities Construction Priority System (HFCPS) methodology. The HFCPS ranks proposals using factors reflecting the total amount of space needed; age and condition of the existing facility, if any; degree of the isolation of population to be served in the proposed facility; and availability of altern ate health care resour ces. There are three phases to the HFCPS. During FY 1991, Ph ase I of the methodology was applied to 149 IHS Area-generated proposals to construct new or replacemen t health care facilities. Based on the Phase I result, the IHS pro ceeded with Phase II of the methodology, by submitting the 28 highest ranked proposals to a more detailed analysis. During FY 1992, the IHS consulted with Tribes about incorpor ating additional flexibility into the HFCPS in order to give consideration to new concepts, such as low acuity beds in health centers, as directed by the Congress in the FY 1992 Conference Report on IHS appropriations. Few Tribes urged the IHS to make change s to the HFCPS. In FY 1993, 23 of the 28 proposals considered in Phase II were advan ced to Phase III. IHS Area Offices were asked to develop Program Justification Documents (PJDs) for each of the 23 proposed facilities. In FY 2008, the last of these PJDs were approved, and the projects were placed on the Healthcare Facilities C onstruction Priority Lists. CJ-199The IHS has two processes for reviewing the staff housing needs. Under the Quarters Construction Priority System methodology, the IHS reviews the need for additional quarters units at all existing health care f acilities. Phases I and II of this methodology were last applied in 1991. As each Program Justification Document for Staff Quarters (PJDQ) is completed for these projects, the projects are added to the Quarters Construction Priority List. The second proce ss responds to the Department of Health and Human Service office of the Inspector Gene ral report of April 17, 1990, regarding needed improvements for planning and constructi on of IHS staff housing. One of the improvements developed was that the IHS began reviewing the need for quarters at each location where new or replacement health care facilities were being planned, and incorporating the planning, design, and construction of needed staff quarters as part of the health care facilities construction projects. The IHS is authorized to construct Yout h Regional Treatment Centers (YRTCs) by Section 704 of the IHCIA, P.L. 94-437, as amended. For the IHS Joint Venture Cons truction Program (JVCP), the De partment of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for FY 1991 (P.L. 101-512) authorized and partially funded a \"joint vent ure demonstration program\" to equip, supply, operate, and maintain up to three health centers. Under this demonstration, these health centers were to be selected on a competitiv e basis from those Tribal appl icants agreeing to provide an appropriate facility for use as a health cen ter for a minimum of 20 years, under a no cost lease. A subsequent update to the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, P.L. 94-437, incorporated authorization for the Joint Ve nture Construction Program as a part of Section 818. Beginning in FY 2003, Congressional language dire cted that staff quarters, if needed, were to be part of the health care facility under the Jo int Venture Construction Program. The costs for facility design and cons truction and staff quarter s, if any were to be borne by participating Tribes. The IHS was to be responsible for all costs associated with staffing, initially equipping, and operating the facilities. The IHS is authorized to provide construction funding to Tribes or Tribal organizations under Section 306 of the IHCIA, P.L. 94- 437, as amended. Funding may be awarded only to Tribes operating non -IHS outpatient facilities under the Indian Self- Determination and Education Assistance Act, P.L. 93-638, service contracts. This authorization is administered unde r the IHS Small Ambulatory Program. Recent Accomplishments - The efficiency measure for the IHS Health Care Facility Construction program for FY 2008 was to co mplete construction of two health care facilities. One Health Care facility was completed ahead of schedule in FY 2007. The other facility was delayed to FY2009 due to P.L. 93-638 Tribal contract negotiations. In FY 2008, the program selected two Joint Venture construction projects, the Vinita Health Center in Vinita, Oklahoma, and the Sa ntee Health Center in Santee, Nebraska. The Santee Health Center was awarded upon approval of the Joint Venture Agreement between the IHS and the Santee Sioux Nation. The IHS is working with the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma to develop approvabl e planning documents, which are required before the IHS can enter into a Joint Venture Agreement. The HHS Strategic Objectives, 1.2 and 1.3, and the IHS Strategic Objectives , 1 and 2 cannot be realized without replacing small and antiquated facilities with appropriately sized facilities, adequate CJ-200staffing, and state-of-the-art equipment. Sufficient resources, facilities, and equipment together with a culturally competent, highl y skilled work force are fundamental to achieving health care access and health status parity with the U.S. general population. The ability to affect health status in any community involves increasing access to quality healthcare.

Barrow Hospital: +$15,234,000 -- These funds will be used to continue construction of the Barrow Hospital, which re ceived initial design and construction funding in 2005. The replacement hospital will provide space to support a modern and adequately staffed health care delivery program, which will improve access to the medical services needed to maintain and promote the health status a nd overall quality of life for the residents of the Barrow Service Area. The IHS health care services for this region are provided in the Samuel Simmonds Memorial Hospital, whic h is operated by the Arctic Slope Native Association, Ltd., under a Public Law (P.L.) 93-638 compact, w ith support services being provided by the Ukpeagvik Inupiat Corporat ion, under a P.L. 93-638 contract. The IHS also contracts with the North Slope Borough to provide community based services. The proposed new replacement hospital will have health care services for inpatient acute care nursing and labor and delivery (8 beds); e ndoscopy and outpatient surgery; ambulatory care; emergency and urgent care; ancillary fo r diagnostic imaging and laboratory; dental; optometry; audiology; physical therapy; community health, including nursing, nutrition; health edu cation, alcoholism, and commun ity health representative program; environmental health; and mental h ealth and social services. The proposed 9 326 gross square meters (GSM) replacement hospital will serve a projected user population of 6,142 generating 26,760 primary car e provider visits and 40,167 outpatient visits. The IHS planned facility includes only IHS supported health care programs. Kayenta Health Center: + $7,000,000 - These funds will be used to continue construction of the Kayenta Health Center a nd associated staff quarters, which received initial design funding in FY 2005. Th e proposed new Kayenta replacement health center will provide space to support a modern and adequately staffed health care delivery program that will improve access to the medical services needed to maintain and promote the health status and overall quality of life fo r the residents of the service area. The health care programs and services provided at this facility include a level III emergency and CJ-201urgent care unit with the support of the Trib al emergency medical services (EMS); a 10- bed short stay nursing unit that provides s ub-acute care; a three- bed low-risk birthing center, which will allow this health center to function as an IHS alternative rural hospital. Additionally, this health center will have comprehensive ambulatory care, ancillary services, preventive community health services , behavioral health services, service unit administration, and facility support services. The proposed 16 638 gross square meters (GSM) new health center has been planne d for a projected us er population of 19,253 generating 53,796 primary care provider vi sits and 107,431 outpatient visits. The existing facility will be disposed of in accordance with established regulations and procedures after the replacement health center is operational. San Carlos Health Center: + $7,000,000 -- Funds in this request will be used to continue construction of the San Carlos Heal th Center and associated staff quarters, which received initial design funding in FY 2005. The existing hospital at San Carlos will be replaced with a mode rn 16 721 gross square meters (GSM) health center that will have alternative rural hospita l capabilities. The replacemen t facility will be a modern, technologically advanced facility with the required staff to provide an expanded level of health care services specifical ly designed to meet the health care needs of the San Carlos Service Unit's projected user populati on of 9,459 and 64,155 primary care provider visits. The facility will include eight acute ca re beds and two birthing beds for a total of ten. New services provided by at the facility will be a two-bed lo w risk birthing unit, physical therapy, telemedicine, podiatry, Ultra-sound, ambulatory procedures, CT, and mammography. The project will also include the construction of 43 new staff housing units.

Prior to 2004, measure was Support local level initiatives directed at reducing tobacco usage. CJ-204The group of measures above outline clinical performance and access to care for eight clinical performance topics and include: diabetes Glycemic control, cancer screening (breast and cervical), Alcohol screening to prevent Feta l Alcohol Syndrome, Tobacco Cessation and immunizations (ch ildhood and adult). Overall trends for these measures show moderate improvement but variations across facilities and across measures were noted. High cost measures such as Glycem ic control, cancer screenings, and tobacco cessation can be attributed to the varied resu lts across measures. In addition, increases in access to care (i.e., service population) have been observed for all measures and are not unique to one individual facility. Due to th e inflation of the serv ice population, clinical results can have an artificial appearance of d eclining performance. With that said, over inflation of the denominator (or increase in the service population) can dilute the true performance result (i.e. the overall number of patients being served has increased). All in all, the biggest attribute noted for these perf ormance measures are the vast gains in access to quality healthcare across a ll topic areas outlined above.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts, Self-Governance Compacts, and competitive cooperative agreements PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS The personnel paid from this account operate and maintain health care facilities and staff quarters. Staff functions supported by this sub-activity include management, operation, and maintenance of real property and build ing systems, medical equipment technical support, and planning and construction management for new and replacement facilities projects. In addition, this sub-activity provides funding for related Area and service unit operating costs, such as utilities, building operation supplies, fac ilities-related personal property, and biomedical equipment repair and maintenance. Lease costs however are funded from the Service appropriations. The IHS is committed to ensuring that health care is provided in functional and safe structures. Because many IHS facilities are located in isolated and remote environments far from urban centers, the IHS also builds a nd maintains residential quarters at those locations to house non-local health care personnel. The IHS owns approximately 912,000 square meters of facilities (buildings and structures) and 743 hectares of Federal and tr ust land. The nature of space varies from sophisticated medical centers to residential units and utility plants. Facilities range in age from less than one year to more than 156 y ears. The average age of our health care facilities is 30 years. In addition to Federally-owned space, the IH S manages direct leased and GSA assigned space. The table below shows the space occupied by IHS and Tribal Health Care Programs. CJ-209Space Occupied by IHS and Tribal Health Care Programs - FY 2008 Type of Facility Federally Owned Direct Federal Lease GSA Assigned Tribal * Hospitals and Health Centers 446,000 M 2 88,000 M2 -0- 280,000 M2 Staff Quarters 320,000 M2 0 M2 -0- 0 M2 Other 146,000 M2 16,000 M2 57,000 M2 312,000 M2 Total 912,000 M2 104,000 M2 57,000 M2 592,000 M2 (FY 2008 end of year) * Tribal Space listed for Hospitals and Health Centers includes all eligible s upported space at locations where direct medical services are provided under P. L. 93-638 contracts in non-IHS owned build ings. Staffing and operations costs (including lease costs) are funde d from the Services appropriation. Four principal staff functions are funded at the Area and Service unit levels through the Facilities Support sub-activity. Facilities Engineering -- Area and Service unit facili ties engineers and staff are responsible for ensuring that IHS building systems are operated properly, facilities and grounds are maintained adequately, utilities are managed appropriately, environmental compliance requirements are met, and buildings are safe. The need for maintenance and improvement projects is dete rmined at the Area le vel and identified in Area Facilities Engineering Plans. Clinical Engineering -- The IHS has highly sophisti cated medical equipment in its inventory. Skilled and specialized personnel are employed to maintain and service that equipment because the lives of patie nts and level of patient care depend on accurate calibration and safe operation. Clinical engineers and technicians perform this critically important function. Larger IHS facilities have clinical engineering personnel on-site, but most IHS and Tribal facilities depend on Area, district, or service unit-based clinical e ngineers and technicians who travel to several facility locations to repair and main tain biomedical equipment. Realty Management -- Area Realty Management O fficers provide technical and management assistance for realty activiti es associated with direct-leased, GSA- assigned, and IHS-owned (and to some degree Tribally-owned) space. The program includes facility and land acquisitions and disposals, licensing/easement processing, use-permit issuance, quarters manageme nt and rent-setting activities, lease administration, and budget functions. The program also helps Tribes and Tribal organizations acquire, administer, and/ or manage excess Federally-owned and Tribally-leased real property. Facilities Planning and Construction -- Some IHS Areas have facilities planning and construction-monitoring components that assist in the pla nning and construction management of new and replacement health care facility and sta ff quarters projects. The need for new and replacement facilities is determined by applying the IHS Health Facilities Construction and Quarters Construction Priori ty System methodologies. Area staffs develop initial proposals for new and replacement facilities, prepare Program Justification Documents, Program of Requirements Documents, and Project CJ-210Summary Documents for projec ts. While construction is underway, Area facilities management staff may be supplemented with construction management personnel to oversee Federal interests in the construction of new and replacement facilities. In addition, the functions of th ese facility and realty positions support new real property asset management requirements as required by Executive Order 13327, \" Real Property Asset Managemen t\"; Executive Order 13423, \" Strengthen Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management\"; Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; and HHS Program Management objectives. These management actions are to ensure management accountability, to ensure the efficient and economic use, to recognize the importance, and to respond to the curre nt condition of Federal real property. The IHS places a high priority on the implem entation of the Greening the Government Executive Orders and meeting Federal, State, and local legal/regu latory environmental requirements, including allocating funding to address findings and recommendations from environmental audits. The costs a ssociated with implementation of these requirements compete against other Facilities Support requirements within the existing budget levels. Starting in FY 2004, a national ef fort was initiated to execute a new cycle of environmental assessment s with emphasis on direct bui lding and grounds related deficiencies with sufficient data to initia te projects to address pending environmental deficiencies. The IHS then annually sets aside Maintenance and Improvement funds in the amounts of approximately $3 million fo r environmental compliance projects and $500,000 for demolition projects. In conjunction with improved management pr actices, energy conservation measures, and projects, IHS reduced the energy related util ity consumption for IHS managed facilities from 2,190,000 British Thermal Unit per Squa re Meter (BTU/SM) in 2003 to 1,964,000 BTU/SM in 2008. These efforts help stem the gr owth in the cost of utilities, which is primarily due to space increases and inflation. IHS will continue all of these functions in FY 2009. However, this will only partially address the overall impact of expected increases in energy cost. During the peri od FY 2003 through FY 2008, total utility costs have increased 62 percent from $15.5 million to $25.1 million and total utility costs per Gross Square Meters increased 60 percent from $25/GSM to $40/GSM. The IHS continues to aggressively investigate options to redu ce energy costs through energy- savings performance contracts, utility ener gy-efficiency service contracts, and other contractual platforms for achieving conservation goals. FY Cost BTU/SM Cost/GSM 2004 14,800,000 2,150,000 2006 21,800,000 1,797,000 $ 33 2007 1,923,000 $ 35 2008 25,100,000 1,964,000 $ 40 CJ-211BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2010 budget request for Facilities Support is $108,831,000. It is an increase of $12,793,000 above the FY 2009 Omnibus level. This request will facilitate the IHS progress towards the real property asset management requirements and goals as outline d in the Executive Order 13327, \"Federal Real Property Asset Management\"; Execu tive Order 13423, \"Strengthen Federal Environmental, Energy, and Transportation Management\"; Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; and the HHS Real Propert y Asset Management Plan. This level of funding will provide: Area Offices, service units and certain Tribal health care entities with funding for staff, utilities, program supplies and equipment to maintain the health care buildings and grounds, and to service approximately $320 million worth of medical equipment. Facilities supported include hospi tals, health centers, staff qua rters, health stations and school health clinics, and youth regional treatment centers. OUTCOMES Program has no outcomes.

Direct Federal, P.L. 93-638 Self-Determination Contracts, Self-Governance Compacts, and competitive cooperative agreements PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS The program provides funding for IHS Area, Di strict and Service Unit environmental health staffs which include engineers, e nvironmental health officers, environmental health technicians, engineering aides, inju ry prevention specialists, and institutional environmental health officers. American I ndians and Alaska Natives face hazards in their environment that contribu te to their health status, including: communities in remote/isolated locations that expose residents to severe c limatic conditions, hazardous geography, and extreme isolatio n; increased exposure to disease carrying insects and rodents; limited availability of housing a nd extensive use of su b-standard housing; unsanitary methods of sewage and garbag e disposal; and unsafe water supply. Division of Sanitation Fac ilities Construction (SFC) staff manages and provides professional engineering services to construct over 400 sanitation projects annually at a total cost of over $190 million 1. These services include management of staff, pre- planning, consultation with Tribes, coordina tion with other federa l, State and local governmental entities, identifying supplementa l funding outside of IHS, developing local policies and guidelines with Tribal consulta tion, developing agreements with Tribes and others for each project, providing project de sign, project construction, assuring environmental and historical preservation pro cedures are followed, assisting Tribes where the Tribes provide construction management, and assisting Tribes with operation and maintenance of constructed facilities. In accordance with the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (Title III, Section 302(g) 1 and 2 of P.L. 94-437) the SFC staff 1 Does not include approximately 150 projects with at total cost of approximately $160 million funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. CJ-213annually updates its inventory of sanitation facilities defi ciencies for existing Indian homes. This is carried out with extensive consultation with Tribes. The SFC staff also develops and updates an inventory of all ope n dump sites on Indian lands as required under the Indian Lands Open Dump Clea nup Act (P.L. 103-399). Both of these inventories are widely used by other govern mental agencies in their evaluation and funding of sanitation projects. Consistent with the 1994 Congressional set aside for \"... tribal training on the operation and mainte nance of sanitation facilities,\" $1,000,000 of these support funds are used to provide fo r continued operation and maintenance training. The SFC staff provides technical assistance, training and guidance to Indian families and communities regarding the operation and main tenance of essential water supply and sewage disposal facilities. To accomplish its goals, the Division of Environmenta l Health Services (DEHS) is a consultative public health advisor to Tribes. The DEHS staff lead in the assessment and identification of environmental hazards and risk factors facing Tribal groups and partner with Tribal groups in the development of sound public health strategies to prevent or mitigate environmental hazards. Strategies employed by DEHS staff include: maintaining surveillance of disease and injury incidence in communities; investigation of disease and injury incidents; identifying e nvironmental hazards in community facilities and institutions such as food service estab lishments, Head Start Centers, community water supply systems, and health care f acilities; and providing training, technical assistance and project funding to develop the capacity of Tribal governments to address their environmental hea lth issues. The DEHS is administered through the following three program emphasis areas: General Environmental Health staffs are the lead environmental health professionals providing environmental health services to Tribes in issues of water quality, waste disposal, hazardous materials management, food sanitation, community injury prevention, institutional environmental health, vector c ontrol, occupational safety and health, and other environmental health issues. Staff and Tribal partners use the Web-base d Environmental Health Reporting System (WebEHRS) to collect community and f acility environmental health data. The WebEHRS data is used for surveillan ce of environmental factors, monitoring community environmental health conditions , and addressing community public health priorities. Data provided by WebEHRS is used by environmental health staff to monitor workload and prioritize environmen tal health conditions in communities with Tribal governments. Expansion of the cap acity of WebEHRS to track activities, projects, and priorities for Tribal and federal environmen tal health programs has been a performance measure for the IHS. Injury Prevention Program staff take the lead in developing public health strategies to reduce the burden of injury experienced by AI/AN. AI/ANs die from injuries and poisonings at a rate 2.5 times the U.S. All Races rate. Treatment of injuries (hospitalizations and ambulatory cases) cost an estimated $350,000,000 per year in direct health care costs to IH S, Tribes, and Contract care facilities. The IHS Injury Prevention Program has developed effective strategies and initiatives to reduce the burden of injury experienced by AI/AN, including: surveillance of community-based injuries; development of targeted based on surveillance data; CJ-214developing community coalitions to addr ess their injury issues; developing the capacity of community coalition members through injury prevention practitioners training; funding competitively awarded cooperative agreement to develop Tribal injury prevention infrastructure; and eval uation program initiatives. In FY 2009, 22 of the 31 Tribal projects to develop Tribal infrastructure are con tinuing best practices as community-based IHS Tribal Injury Pr evention Cooperative Agreements. The program awards consisted of 22 five-year pr ograms and 8 three-year projects. In FY 2008 and 2009, the 8 three-year projects wi ll be completed. There were no new awards in FY 2006 - FY 2009. The next award cycle is expected to be announced in FY 2010 after the 22 five-year programs have been completed. The Institutional Environmental Health (IEH ) program is comprised of staff with specialized skills to quantify, evaluate, and respond to unique environmental and safety hazards found in health care, educati onal, childcare, correc tional, and industrial facilities. The IEH program staffs are knowledgeable of and provide suppor t in the following disciplines: infection control, industria l hygiene, radiation protection, hazardous materials and waste, safety management, ergonomics, fire/life safety, emergency management, public health preparedness, s ecurity, and environmental compliance. Also, IEH program staffs perform evaluati ons and management system reviews of IHS and Tribal health care facilities seeking accreditation an d/or certification. Maintaining accreditation ensures that IHS continues to have access to third party funding. The IEH program utilizes a web-based occupational health incident reporting system called \"WebCident\" in IHS health care facilities. WebCident is used to report injuries, illnesses, hazardous conditions, security, and property-related incidents experienced by visitors, patients, and others, as appr opriate. WebCident is used to prepare required Occupational Safety and Health Ad ministration logs, identify, document and track hazardous conditions, report trends to assist with the development of targeted prevention strategies. DEHS continues to support the expansion of WebCident to all IHS and Tribal health care facilities and refine the program from feedback provided by users. Data developed through WebCid ent will be used to reduce occupational injuries/illnesses and associated workers' compensation claims, and reduce/eliminate hazards to employees, patients, visitors, and others. TRIBAL HEALTH PROGRAMS The IHS Area, District and Service unit enviro nmental health personnel also train Tribal employees to provide environmental health se rvices, under contract with IHS wherever a Tribe desires, provided that funds are avai lable and other considerations make such arrangement practicable. As a result of tr aining provided by IHS, Tribal environmental health personnel are better prepared to provi de higher levels of service to the Indian people and to support the provisi on of direct patient care se rvices. For example, some Tribes have chosen to contract for the provi sion of the full range of environmental health services as typically provided by the IHS direct delivery program. CJ-215Area, District and Service unit environmental health personnel work with Tribes/Tribal organizations to encourage maximum particip ation in planning health services delivery programs. Also, they provide technical assistance to the Tribal officials who carry out administrative/management responsibilities associated with operation of federally supported programs. Their support of self-determination for Tribal organizations will continue. However, the extent to which ther e is participation in the self-determination process depends on, and is determined by, th e individual Tribes/Tribal organizations. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2010 budget request for Environmenta l Health Support is $68,142,000. It is an increase of $1,120,000 above the FY 2009 Omnibus level. The request funds the costs of personnel w ho accomplish environmen tal health services, injury prevention activities, and sanitation f acilities construction ac tivities, at the IHS Area, District, and Service unit levels and pa ys operating costs associated with provision of those services and activities. Environmental Health Services staff will ut ilize WebEHRS to identify environmental health risk factors. Multiple interventions will be implemented in FY 2009 to address each identified risk factor.

The FY 2007 target was to im plement three community injury prevention projects and report them using an automated tracking system, and the target was met. The FY 2008 target was for each Area to conduct a seat belt observation survey in 1 site to get a baseline usage rate for that site. The targ et was met. All 11 Areas conducted seat belt usage surveys to get baseline rates. In FY 2009, the measure was 1 pilot project in 11 Areas (implementing a comprehensive interven tion designed to increase restraint use) per Area. In FY 2010 the target is yet to be dete rmined. . The original, pilot project in each Area will be continued. Past trends for the Environmental Surveilla nce measure have shown an increase in the number of environmental health programs with automated web-based environmental health surveillance data colle ct system (WebEHRS). The FY 2007 target of 29 was met and a result of 32 was achieved. Because this system is now in wide use, the FY 2008 CJ-216target was to set a baseline rate for identifyi ng and addressing environmental risk factors in communities in 11 of the Areas. This ta rget was exceeded. Twelve Areas identified baseline risk factors. The FY 2009 target is for each of Ar ea to implement at least three interventions to address one of the environmental risk factor s identified in FY 2008. The FY 2010 measure is yet to be determined.

Headquarters personnel have management responsibility for IHS facilities and environmental health programs, provide direct technical services a nd support to Area personnel, and perform critical management functions. Headquarters management activi ties includes national policy development and implementation, budget formulation, project re view and approval, congressional report preparation, quality assurance (internal cont rol reviews, Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act activities and other oversight), technical assistance (consultation and training), long range planning, meetings (with the Department of Health and Human Services, Members of Congress and their re presentatives, Tribes, and other Federal agencies), and recruitment and retention. T ypical direct support functions performed by OEHE personnel who serve as project officer s for health care facilities construction projects are: reviewing and/ or writing technical justification documents, participating in design reviews and site surveys, conducting onsite inspections, and monitoring project funding status, etc. In addition, these positions s upport new real property asset management requirements as required by Executive Order 13327, Real Pr operty Asset Management; and HHS Program Management objectives. These actions are to ensure management accountability and to ensure the efficient and economic use of Fe deral real property, while recognizing the importance of these assets and responding to their current condition. CJ-218In FY 2009, OEHE Support funded personnel and developed and utilized data systems to distribute resources to Area offices for facil ities and environmental health activities. Also, technical guidance, information, and training were provided throughout the IHS system in support of the F acilities Appropriation. So me of the activities and accomplishments include approval of Program Justification Documents and Program of Requirements, announcement and selection of Joint Venture and Small Ambulatory projects, and awarding contracts for health care facilities construction. OEHE continued to coordinate between a centr alized approach to facilities management and infrastructure outside of the IHS to the geographical challenges of the Indian Health System. The coordination effort of a decentr alized management structure throughout the IHS is complex. Health care delivery decisions are made locally and infrastructure needs are community based to avoid inappropriate de cisions to be made from a distance which may adversely affect Indian communities. BUDGET REQUEST The FY 2010 budget request for Office of Environmental Health and Engineering Support is $16,114,000, which is an incr ease of $845,000 above the FY2009 Omnibus level. OEHE collects and reports facility the data for the IHS to HHS. This information is consolidated at the HHS level for all Oper ating Divisions of HHS and reported to the Office of Management and Budget. OEHE c ontinues to coordinate the requirements of HHS and the mission of the IHS. Targets a nd measurements are documented in the HHS Real Property Asset Management Plan.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS This sub-activity supports maintenance, re placement, and the purchase of new biomedical equipment at IHS and Tribal health care facilities. The IHS and Tribal health programs mana ge laboratory, x-ray, and biomedical equipment valued at approximately $320 million. Accurate clinical diagnosis and effective therapeutic procedures depend in large part on health care providers using modern and effective medical equipment to a ssure the best possible health outcomes. The average life expectancy for today's me dical device is approximately six years depending on the intensity of use, maintenance, and technical advances. In FY 2009, the medical equipment program distributed over $16 million to IHS and tribal health programs to purchase new medical equipm ent, including replacement of existing equipment used in diagnosing and treatment of illnesses. Allocation of medical equipment funds is formula based. The remaining equipment funds are allocated as for new medical equipment in tribally-cons tructed health care facilities ($5 million) and for the TRANSAM and ambulance programs ($1 million).

Under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, $20 million was appropriated to Equipment activities. Medical e quipment at many IHS and Tribal health care sites is out of date or inadequate, especia lly at sites with high volumes of patients. Recovery Act funds ($8.5 million) will be used to mitigate so me of the most pressing needs. Recovery Act funds ($5 million) also will be used to replace approximately 62 ambulances at IHS and tribal emergency medical services programs. Many of the existing ambulances are beyond their useful life and need replacement.

Operating Division contributions are combined to create an Enterprise Information Technology (EIT) Fund that finances both the specific HHS information technology initiatives identified thro ugh the HHS Information Technology Capital Planning and Investment Control process and E-Government initiatives. These HHS enterprise initiatives meet cross-functional criteria and are approved by the HHS IT Investment Review Board based on funding availability a nd business case benefits. Development is collaborative in nature a nd achieves HHS enterprise-wid e goals that produce common technology, promote common standards, and enab le data and system interoperability. Of the amount specified above, $147,619.23 is allocated to support the E-Government initiatives for FY 2010 . This amount supports E-Government initiatives as follows: FY 2010 HHS Contributions to E-Gov Initiatives* IHS Line of Business - Federal Heal th Architecture (FHA) $73,691.04 Line of Business - Human Resources $32,014.65 Line of Business - Grants Management $1,100.18 Line of Business - Financial $3,175.71 Line of Business - Budget Formulation and Execution $2,111.85 Line of Business - IT Infrastructure $3,556.80 Disaster Assistance Improvement Plan $31,969.00 E-Gov Initiatives Total $147,619.23 *The total for all HHS FY 2010 inter-agency E-Government and Line of Business contributions for the initiatives identified above, and any new development items, is not currently projected by the Federal CIO Council to increase above th e FY 2009 aggregate level. Specific levels presented here are subject to change, as redistributions to meet ch anges in resource demands are assessed. Prospective benefits from these initiatives are: Lines of Business-Federa l Health Architecture: Creates a consistent Federal framework that improves coordination and co llaboration on national Health Information Technology (HIT) Solutions; improves effici ency, standardization, reliability and availability to improve the exchange of comprehensive health information solutions, including health care delivery; and, to pr ovide appropriate patient access to improved health data. HHS works closely with federal pa rtners, state, local a nd tribal governments, including clients, consultants, collaborators and stakeholders who be nefit directly from common vocabularies and tec hnology standards through incr eased information sharing, increased efficiency, decreased technical support burdens and decreased costs. Lines of Business-Human Resources Management: Provides standardized and interoperable HR solutions u tilizing common core functiona lity to support the strategic management of Human Capital. HHS has been selected as a Center of Excellence and will be leveraging its HR investments to provide services to other Federal agencies. CJ-231Lines of Business-Grants Management: Supports end-to-end grants management activities cu stomer service; decision making; financial management processes; efficiency of reporting procedure; and, post-award closeout actions. An HHS agency, Administration for Children and Families (ACF), is a GMLOB consortia lead, which has allowed ACF to take on customers external to HHS. These additional agency users have allowed HHS to reduce overhead costs for internal HHS users. Additionally, NIH is an internally HHS-designated Center of Excellence and has applied to be a GMLOB consortia lead. This effort has allowed HHS agencies using the NIH system to reduce grants management costs. Both efforts have allowed HHS to achieve economies of scale and efficiencies, as well as streamlin ing and standardization of grants processes, thus reducing overall HHS costs for grants management systems and processes. Lines of Business -Financial Management: Supports efficient and improved business performance while ensuring integrity in acc ountability, financial controls and mission effectiveness by enhancing process improvements; achieving cost savings; standardizing business processes and data models; promoting seamless data exchanges between Federal agencies; and, strengthening internal controls. Lines of Business-Budget Formulation and Execution: Allows sharing across the Federal government of common budget formulation and execution practices and processes resulting in improved practices within HHS. Lines of Business-IT Infrastructure: This initiative provides th e potential to leverage spending on commodity IT infrastructure to gain savings; to promote and use common, interoperable architectures that enable data sh aring and data standardization; secure data interchanges; and, to grow a Federal workforce with interchangeable skills and tool sets. Disaster Assistance Improvement Plan (DAIP): The DAIP, managed by Department of Homeland Security, assists agencies with active disaster assistance programs such as HHS to reduce the burden on other federal ag encies which routinel y provide logistical help and other critical management or organizational support during disasters.

Therefore, an indirect method was used for calculating immunization costs based on an estimated patient population and the amount of staff time for required immunizations, as well as the immunization costs not available through the Vaccines for Children program. Immunization costs were categorized by two ta rget populations; infant s and children (3 to 27 months of age) and adults ( 65 years of age). By combining these two groups, an estimate of $10,540,043 was calculated for the IHS immunization expenditures in FY 2004 with in flation costs added into the equation: FY 2005 Estimated Costs = FY 2004 cost times 3.7 percent FY 2006 Estimated Costs = FY 2005 cost times 3.3 percent FY 2007 Estimated Costs = FY 2006 cost times 4.0 percent FY 2008 Estimated Costs = FY 2007 cost times 4.2 percent FY 2009 Estimated Costs = FY 2008 cost times 4.2 percent FY 2010 Estimated Costs = FY 2009 cost times 4.2 percent For FY 2008, $8,857,800 was added for adult vaccine for Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) for females 19 - 26 years costs. The total co st does not include inflation, which may affect future estimated costs. The met hodology was calculated based on the following assumptions: 1. 20 percent coverage of the 19 - 26 year old female user population (~23,855) 2. Cost of a 3 dose series of the vaccine at $360.00 Overall, the estimated costs for th ese immunizations are affected by: CJ-235 1.

In keeping w ith the concept of tribal sove reignty, IHS policy implements the ISDEAA and maximizes opportunities for tribes to exercise their right to manage and operate IHS health programs, or portions thereof, under Title I and Title V, as well as those tribes who choose their health services to be provided directly by the IHS. The IHS recognizes that tribal decisions to contract/compact or not to contract/compact are equal expressions of self-determination. Title I Contracts and Title V Self-Governance Compacts -- The IHS contracts/compacts with tribes and tribal organizations (T/TO) pursuant to the authority provided under Title I and Title V of the ISDEAA, as amended. This Act allows T/TO to enter into contracts/compacts with the Government to plan, conduct, and administer programs that are authorized under Section 102 of the Act. The IHS has be en contracting with T/TO pursuant to the authority of P.L. 93-638 since its passage in 1975. Today, the IHS currently administers self-determination contracts under Title I and compacts authorized under Title V valued at more than $1.8 billi on. The IHS currently administers contracts and Annual Funding Agreements (AFA) with 236 tr ibes or tribal orga nizations pursuant to Title I of the ISDEAA. The IHS currently administers compacts and Funding Agreements authorized under Title V of the ISEAA who meet certain criteria. To date, 75 Title V compacts and 96 Funding Agreements have been negotiated with 328 Tribes. IHS and Tribally-Operated Serv ice Unit and Medical Facilities -- The total dollars administered under ISDEAA contracts and comp acts have nearly doubled in recent years and the scope of services managed and provi ded by tribal programs has also expanded greatly. Tribes have historically assumed control of community serv ices first and then expanded into medical care. For example, the Community Health Representatives program and community-based components of the alcohol programs have been almost 100 percent tribally oper ated. The number of Tribally operated hospitals has now started to rise, and over 20 percent of the hospitals funded by IHS are managed by tribes. This trend is expanding their scope and is also reflected in the increasing number of ambulatory medical facilities now managed by tribes. Self-Determination Implementation: Contract Support Cost Funding -- Because the rate of T/TO entering into self-determination co ntracts and compacts has been steadily increasing, the demand for contract support cost (CSC) funding to support T/TO in their contracting/compacting has also increased. The CSC funding is authorized pursuant to Section 106(a)(2) of the ISDEAA. This f unding has been used by T/TO to develop strong, stable tribal governments capacity to professionally manage their contracts/ compacts and the corresponding services to th eir communities. Additionally, through the funding of CSC, the IHS has helped in the development of T/TO who are maturing and CJ-238now achieving greater levels of self-sufficiency in health care operations and administration. The primary growth in CSC since 2003 can be attributed to the need to maintain the current level of services as annual program increases are included in ongoing contracts and compacts. Additional increased needs for CSC is attributed to the increased contracting and compacting of new or expanded programs, services, functions, or activities by T/TO under both Title I and V of the ISDEAA. The Agency has taken steps to ensure that funding provided is allowable, allocable, reas onable, and necessary and has recently adopted standards for the review and approval of CSC. This has proven beneficial in maintaining consistency in the determination of tribal CSC requirements. The T/TO support an appropriate share of administrative streamlining. The IHS has provided administrative shares of its budget to T/TO associated with their contracting and compacting activities since 1995.

For an additional amount fo r ''Indian Health Facilities'', for facilities construction projects, deferred maintenance and improvement projects, the backlog of sanitation projects and the purchase of equipment, $415,000,000, of which $227,000,000 is provided within the health faci lities construction activity for the completion of up to two facilities from the curre nt priority list for which work has already been initiated (page 57). Action taken or to be taken The ARRA funds will be used to complete cons truction of two health care facilities; for the facility in Nome, Alaska and one other not yet determined. The Omnibus Appropriat ions Act (P.L. 111-8) Item Dental Services - The Service, and particularly the Di rector of Oral H ealth, is strongly encouraged to redouble its efforts to a ddress the alarmingly high vacancy rates among health professionals, for example 31 percent among dental professi onals, in the Indian Health Service. Therefore, an increas e of $8,299,000 over the fiscal year 2008 enacted level has been provided for Dental Services in order to maintain current levels of care and provide for the staffing of new facilities (page 53). Action taken or to be taken The IHS Division of Oral Health (DOH) has been able to implement a number of recruitment incentives for oral health providers and as a result, the vacancy rate for oral health providers has dropped by 40% si nce August 2008 and the DOH continues to receive strong interest from de ntal students and oral health providers in current and projected vacancies. Item Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders and Alcohol Screening - In addition, the Service is encouraged to participate in the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders and Alcohol Screening. Intervention and Re ferral Initiative (page 53). Action taken or to be taken The Division of Behavioral Health (DBH) currently funds the Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) Training Project which focu ses on the needs of the IHS for continued research and training in the prevention of FASD. The FASD Training Project, which is implemented through the Univer sity of Washington, in collaboration with the Northwest CJ-244Portland Area Indian Health Board (NPAIHB) , provides technical a ssistance and training to American Indian and Alaska Natives (AI/ AN) Tribal FASD programs in their efforts to develop and implement more effective FASD prevention, intervention and treatment programs. The NPAIHB disseminates up- to-date FASD information to AI/AN communities and providers who specia lize in FASD issues. The NPAIHB also works to develop public awar eness materials on FASD. Item Hospitals and Clinics Program - Within the resources available to the Hospitals and Clinics program the Service is encouraged to provide such assistance as may be necessary for the newly formed Nevada Indian Health Board to fully establish its operations (page 53). Action taken or to be taken IHS will provide requisite support to facili tate the Nevada Indian Health Board's understanding and compliance as a Tribal entity eligible fo r Federal grants funding in accordance with 25 USC 1603(e). 25 USC 1603(e) defines Tribal organizations as the elected governing body of any Indian tribe or any legally establis hed organization of Indians which is controlled by one or more such bodies or by a board of directors elected or selected by one or more such bodies (or elected by the Indian popul ation to be served by such organization) and which includes the maximum participation of Indians in all phases of its activities. Item Health Professions - Within the amount provided for Indian Health Professions it is expected that the Service will fund th e Indians Into Medicine (INMED), Recruitment/Retention of American Indians into Nursing (RAIN) and Indians into Psychology (INPSYCH) programs at no less than the current levels and manage them in the same manner as in prior years. The Service is also expected to use health professions program funding for loan repayment and scholarship programs to encourage increased recruitment and retention of h ealth professionals (page 53). Action taken or to be taken The IHS uses health professions funding (in addition to Hospitals a nd Clinics funding) to recruitment and retention of health profe ssionals. Providing mark eting and outreach to students and recent graduates not only provide s them information about the scholarship and loan repayment programs, but lets students know about job oppor tunities available after they complete their schooling/training. Item Indian Health Care Improvement Fund - The Indian Health Serv ice is directed to use the Indian health Care Improvement Fund to br ing the units with the highest level of need up to at least 40 percent befo re allocating funds to units with needs above 40 percent (page 53). CJ-245Action taken or to be taken The purpose of the IHCIF is: (1) eliminating the deficiencies in health status and resources of all Indian tribes, (2) eliminat ing backlogs in the pr ovision of health care services to Indians, and (3) meeting the he alth needs of Indians in an efficient and equitable manner. Funds are allocated in proportion to funding deficiency scores measured by the Federal Disparity Index - an index of comparability with the Federal Employees Health Plan. The FY 2008 and 2009 appropriations for the IHCIF raised all scores to at least 40 percen t. The FY 2010 President's B udget recommends a significant increase of 13 percent over the FY 2009 Omnibus level to strengthen the I ndian health system and improve the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives. The IHS plans to review the methodology, gather the latest data, and produce up-to-date deficiency scores by 2nd quarter, FY 2010. Item Health Professionals - The high vacancy rate of health professionals in the Indian Health Service has not been substantially alleviated by current recruitment and retention efforts. To the extent possible, the Service is encouraged to use the construction and improvement of staffing quarters as a vital tool to recruit and retain these health professionals (page 54). Action taken or to be taken The IHS uses a multifaceted recruitment and marketing effort to attract and retain health professionals. To the extent possible, in FY 2010, IHS will inform students and health professionals about new facilities, new housi ng and renovations to ex isting facilities and housing, using these updates as one of our marketing points.
