We continue to adapt to the evolving pandemic environment and follow the requirements set forth by the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Below are: - Our Current COVID-19 Policies - COVID-19 Vaccination - COVID-19 Testing - COVID-19 Treatments COVID-19 Pandemic Clinic Policies We are increasing our efforts to prevent the spread of any illness. To do so, we are emphasizing and/or implementing the following measures: Patient Care - Routine phone screening of all patients - Screening upon arrival with containment and isolation, if necessary - Requiring all visitors to wear a medical grade mask (surgical, N95, KN95) while at our clinic. Providing one for those who do not have one. - Implementing telemedicine visits for any person with infectious exposure potential - Increasing physical space between employees and patients when and where appropriate, including asking patients to physically distance while in our welcome area. - Practicing good hand hygiene & providing access to hand sanitizer - Observing respiratory etiquette (sneezing or coughing into your elbow rather than your hands) - Asking patients and employees to avoid eating or drinking near others Clinic Management - The Oregon Health Authority and our employee's medical licensing boards have mandated the following requirements: - All employees are to be fully vaccinated. - All employees must wear medical masks consistently with patients and in shared office spaces when six feet of distancing cannot be maintained and/or if contact is greater than 15 minutes. - Emphasizing regular handwashing with and between patients & consistent use of hand sanitizer - Sanitizing surfaces and medical equipment regularly, between each patient visit, before opening, and after closing. - Maintaining adequate inventory of medical supplies and personal protective equipment - Encouraging any employee who does not feel well or who have been exposed to stay home to prevent the spread of any illness - Regular training on current clinic policies and best practices With respect to patients and visitors, anyone with respiratory symptoms who thinks they may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 or other respiratory illnesses such as the flu or strep should first call the clinic before coming to our clinic so that provisions can be made to minimize exposure of other patients. Violating our clinic safety policies may result in a written warning or termination from our clinic. It is our highest priority to ensure the safety and health of our patients, visitors, and employees. Any update to information regarding clinic hours or protocols will be posted on our social medial platforms and our website as we see what becomes necessary in the days to come. We appreciate your cooperation and efforts to keep our community safe and healthy during this uncertain time. Stay safe, stay healthy. COVID-19 Vaccine Updates Northwest Integrative Medicine (NWIM) continues to work with the Oregon Health Authority to provide our patients with COVID-19 immunization options. The state determines COVID-19 and flu vaccine availability for our clinic and we are currently able to offer the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. These are available and approved for everyone 18 years and older for initial series and as booster immunizations for those that meet state qualifications. Please consult with your provider to determine if you are eligible for a booster immunization. Pediatric Vaccination: The FDA recently approved the Pfizer vaccine for children ages 5-11. Because of the storage and facility requirements of this vaccine, NWIM is not able to store this vaccine in our clinic, thereby we cannot offer pediatric COVID-19 vaccination at this time. We expect the FDA will approve additional vaccines for the pediatric population in the coming months, but this timeframe is not known. When we are able, we intend to offer Moderna and J&J pediatric vaccination. We will announce this via newsletter, on our portal, social media sites, and website. For children and adults who are unable to be vaccinated at this time we suggest continued vigilance with handwashing, mask wearing, and social distancing. You can expect hypervigilance in terms of screening practices and types of appointments available to you when calling to schedule an appointment. For those seeking vaccination for their children, we suggest using the statewide resource: [https://govstatus.egov.com/find-covid-19-vaccine](https://govstatus.egov.com/find-covid-19-vaccine) [www.OHSU.edy/kidvaccines](http://www.ohsu.edy/kidvaccines) is another great resource for staying up to date on current recommendations. Covid-19 Testing Our clinic offers PCR and rapid antigen testing for common respiratory infections, including Influenza A and B, RSV, strep A, and COVID-19. We are unable to test for Kaiser insurance patients. You must go to a Kaiser testing facility. Due to supply chain issues, deliveries, and allocation holds through manufacturers, we must limit testing for those who are triaged by their provider and who are found that testing is clinically necessary. This means: 1. We do not offer rapid testing for travel purposes. 2. Rapid testing supplies are in high demand around our state but less reliably available. 3. Rapid testing may not be available when needed. PCR testing and quarantine is still a reasonable option. How to be tested: You must meet with one of our providers via telehealth for an acute evaluation. During this appointment your provider may advise that you be screened for several infections by our lab staff. A lab appointment is then scheduled with our MA for collection either same day or early the next morning. 1. Schedule a telemedicine appointment with a provider. If approved for testing, schedule a lab collection appointment that same day or early the next morning. 2. Samples are collected in our parking lot. When you arrive, stay in your car. 3. Call the clinic to alert them of your arrival and two staff members will come out for collection. 4. DO NOT ENTER THE CLINIC FOR TESTING. Getting Results Rapid antigen testing results within thirty minutes. You will be contacted by text or phone and through the portal with results. Your results will be shared with you. PCR tests typically take 2-5 days to result, depending on the current local demands on lab facilities.

Covid-19 Care Plan Northwest Integrative Medicine is committed to helping patients through and beyond COVID-19 infection. Availability Our providers primarily work with infectious patients remotely using telehealth services. Treatments We advise you from diagnosis through recovery, offering guidance on evaluation, home treatments, nutritional, botanical, and pharmacologic medicines to help your symptoms and to support your immune function. There are only a few treatments that have received FDA or EUA approval for the treatment and management of COVID-19. [You can stay up to date on current recommendations here](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/emergency-preparedness-drugs/coronavirus-covid-19-drugs). Monoclonal Antibodies and Non-Approved Treatments Monoclonal antibody treatment is available for those who qualify via screening. You must be referred by a healthcare provider or meet with an NWIM provider for triage and assessment prior to scheduling the treatment. We can offer this to patients from outside clinics with confirmation of infection and evaluation with our staff. This treatment is only effective when initiated quickly. You will be instructed clearly in our procedures about this treatment by our staff. Do not enter our clinic without being directed to do so. To discuss obtaining treatment, please call our front staff at 503-855-4341. Our providers do NOT prescribe ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, glucoxamine for COVID-19 infections as they are not FDA or EUA approved. The Oregon Board of Naturopathic Medicine (OBNM) has recommended against naturopathic prescribing of these medications. Remdesivir is also not prescribed as this is being reserved for those who are hospitalized. "}
