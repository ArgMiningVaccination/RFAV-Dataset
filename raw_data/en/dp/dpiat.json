Acupuncture practitioners work on pathways of energy called \"meridians\". It is believed that the QI energy circulates and connects all the important organs and glands with the skin surface. Traditional Chinese Medicine believes that any disease arises due to an imbalance or blockage in the body's natural energy flow. This imbalance in energy flow results in physical and psychological disorders. Acupuncture points are areas of electrical sensitivity. Thin, sterilized stainless-steel needles are inserted into precise acupuncture points to release the blockage, thereby mobilizing the body's natural immune response. This helps support the body's ability to heal on its own. Acupuncture is relatively painless, it relaxes the body and mind, creating a sense of well-being.

Studies have shown that cupping can affect tissues as deep as four inches underneath the surface of the skin, causing toxins to release, lymph flow to increase, and increasing circulation at the cellular level. When there is a significant amount of reaction to the cups, they may leave red or even purplish rings where the cups were placed. The rings are evidence of the stagnant blood coming to the surface of the body. These marks usually go away in 4-6 days, and rarely last more than 10 days. $15 add on to traditional Chinese acupuncture or massage or $69 for a 30min session. GUA SHA Gua sha is an ancient therapy that activates the lymphatic system, breaking down scar and fibrous tissue while relieving pain & soreness. The techniques involves a gentle scraping of the surface of the skin. Oil is placed on the skin, and then short brisk strokes are applied using a smooth rounded object. This painless scraping motion will cause a redness of the skin, called sha. The darker the sha, sometimes even purple, the more toxins and stagnation are being released. Patients will leave feeling an immediate sense of relief and increased relaxation. $15 add on to traditional Chinese acupuncture or massage. "}
