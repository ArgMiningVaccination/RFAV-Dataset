Arguably one of Western esotericism's most ambitious and widely influential thinkers, Rudolf Steiner has left an astonishing legacy of cultural products that continue to have influence beyond the institutional reach of Anthroposophy, the new religious movement he founded. One such legacy is his system of agriculture, known today as Biodynamic agriculture, or Biodynamics. This method, combining a distrust of modern argo-chemical applications and a desire to spiritually, as well as physically, nourish the individual, is now disseminated in a range of industries, and is often applied in ways that have little to do with Anthroposophy or Steiner. The current fascination in the wine industry for Biodynamic methods serves as a useful example for exploring what Steiner believed and set out for farmers, as well as for highlighting how these techniques are used today. paradigm for understanding Biodynamic Agriculture is here used to frame a discussion utilising a production of culture... ISSRNC Award-winning Best Student Paper (International Society for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture) 2019 An esoterically-inspired agronomy is engaging a significant number of renown Swiss winecrafters in an holistic apprehension of nature. Known as \"biodynamic farming\", this agronomy derives from Rudolf Steiner, the charismatic founder of the anthroposophical movement. This would apparently stand for a spiritualization of the wine-crafting milieu, namely inserting references to the \"selves\" and to \"(super)sensitivity\" in defining one's personalized agronomy. In this presentation I critically address how does Swiss wine-crafters spiritualize their profession and what is being spiritualized. Considering \"spirituality\" as a broad and loosely defined notion (Ammerman 2012; Eisenmann&al 2015), I consider in this paper \"spirituality\" to be in that case a contextually grounded category related to specific preoccupations of the wine-crafting population. Through historical and textual as well as empirical insights from my ethnographic fieldwork, I explore the broad semantic field and social dynamics of \"spirituality\" in regard to its implantation within Swiss wine-crafting milieu and agroecological concerns.

Journal of Organic Systems Journal of Organics \"It is a truth generally acknowledged that religions have been the earliest and perhaps the chief progenitors of cultural products in human societies. Mesopotamian urban centres developed from large temple complexes, Greek drama emerged from religious festivals dedicated to deities including Dionysos and Athena, and in more recent times Christianity has inspired artistic masterpieces including the 'St Matthew Passion' by the Lutheran Johann Sebastian Bach (1686-1750), the motets of the Catholic William Byrd (1540-1623), and the striking paintings of the Counter-Reformation Spaniards Ribera, Zurbaran and Murillo in the seventeenth century. The Indian religious tradition contributes the magnificent Hindu and Buddhist temples of Angkor (Cambodia), and the exquisite Chola bronze statues, and Islam the sophisticated Timurid illustrated manuscripts of Firdausi's Shahnama. Many more examples could be adduced, including forms of dance, systems of education, theories of government, special diets, and modes of costume and fashion. Yet the cultural products of new religions and spiritualities are generally ignored, derided or deemed to not exist. Much of this prejudice stems from the tendency to exclude new religions from the category of 'real religions'. This edited collection seeks to remedy a scholarly lacuna by investigating the cultural products of new religions, both as exemplifications of the theological and spiritual principles of particular movements, and also in terms of their impact on wider society. Subjects for investigation include: the architecture of Mormon and Baha'i temples; Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophical education system; the music composed by the esoteric teacher G. I. Gurdjieff; and the diet advocated by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness.\" 2013 Environment, conservation, green, and kindred movements look back to Rachel Carson's 1962 book Silent Spring as a milestone. The impact of the book, including on government, industry, and civil society, was immediate and substantial, and has been extensively described; however, the provenance of the book has been less thoroughly examined. Using Carson's personal correspondence, this paper reveals that the primary source for Carson's book was the extensive evidence and contacts compiled by two biodynamic farmers, Marjorie Spock and Mary T. Richards, of Long Island, New York. Their evidence was compiled for a suite of legal actions (1957-1960) against the U.S. Government and that contested the aerial spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). During Rudolf Steiner's lifetime, Spock and Richards both studied at Steiner's Goetheanum, the headquarters of Anthroposophy, located in Dornach, Switzerland. Spock and Richards were prominent U.S. anthroposophists, and established a biodynamic farm under the tutelage of the leading biodynamics exponent of the time, Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer. When their property was under threat from a government program of DDT spraying, they brought their case, eventually lost it, in the process spent US$100,000, and compiled the evidence that they then shared with Carson, who used it, and their extensive contacts and the trial transcripts, as the primary input for Silent Spring. Carson attributed to Spock, Richards, and Pfeiffer, no credit whatsoever in her book. As a consequence, the organics movement has not received the recognition, that is its due, as the primary impulse for Silent Spring, and it is, itself, unaware of this provenance. Journal of Organics 2016 Ernesto Genoni (1885-1975) was a pioneer of biodynamic and organic farming in Australia. He was the first Australian member of Rudolf Steiner's Experimental Circle of Anthroposophic Farmers & Gardeners (joining in 1928). Others in Ernesto's set joined the Experimental Circle, including his eldest brother, Emilio (in 1930), Ruby Macpherson (in 1935), and her niece, Ileen Macpherson (in 1936). Ernesto and Ileen founded and farmed Australia's original 'Demeter Farm' (from 1935). However biodynamic and organic farming was but one aspect of Ernesto's life. Ernesto trained for five years in classical art at the prestigious Brera Academy of Fine Art in Milan (Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera). Ernesto spent the year 1924 at Dornach, Switzerland, the headquarters of Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophy movement, where he experimented with painting \"in the anthroposophic way\". The works presented here and in the exhibition, Angels of the First Class, are believed to be those works. Eleven images (image 1 and images 5 through 14) were recently revealed stored in a folder in a private collection along with Ernesto's personal poster of the first Goetheanum (image 4). Images 15 and 16 are from two other private collections and are included here (and in the exhibition) because, by size, content, and style, they appear to be part of Ernesto's suite of Anthroposophic paintings of 1924. A century ago, Ernesto joined the AIF in Western Australia and served as a stretcher bearer on the killing fields of the Western Front in 1916, in the battles of the Somme and Pozi\u00e8res. From the battlefield, he was conscripted into the Italian Army, and he was eventually demobilised in Italy in 1919. In 1923 , Ernesto was still in Italy. From Milan, he wrote to Rudolf Steiner offering his labour for advancing the Anthroposophy project at Dornach. Ernesto arrived there early in 1924 and successfully applied to Dr Steiner for acceptance into the First Class (Erste Klasse der Freien Hochschule f\u00fcr Geisteswissenschaft). The First Class was Steiner's new course of instruction in Spiritual Science for Anthroposophists who were established in their practice. Steiner held these classes from 15 February through to 20 September of 1924. In 1926, Ernesto migrated to Australia (after two previous visits) with the intention of exhibiting his art - most probably his classical style oil paintings - but he was thwarted in this plan by the prevailing Depression. In Australia, Ernesto co-founded the Michael Group in Melbourne (Anthroposophy meetings beginning in 1928) for the study of Steiner's works. He taught the First Class in Melbourne and Adelaide. The works presented here were first exhibited as Angels of the First Class: The Anthroposophic Art of Ernesto Genoni, Goetheanum, 1924, held at the Vital Years Conference 2016, Hobart, Tasmania in July 2016. It is believed to be the first exhibition of art works by Ernesto Genoni.
