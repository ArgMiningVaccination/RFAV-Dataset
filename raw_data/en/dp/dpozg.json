Soeken, Ph.D. Methodologist Mary Tierney, M.D. Project Manager viii Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthmaix PrefacePreface The Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR\u20143) Summary Report 2007: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma was developed by an expert panel commissioned by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Coordinating Committee (CC), coordinated by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health. Using the 1997 EPR\u20142 guidelines and the 2002 update on selected topics as the framework, the expert panel organized the literature review and updated recommendations for managing asthma long term and for managing exacerbations around four essential components of asthma care, namely: assessme nt and mo nitoring, patie nt education, control of factors contributing to asthma severity, and pharma cologic treatment. Subtopics were developed foreachof these four broad categories. The EPR\u20143 Full Report and the EPR\u20143 Summary Report 2007 have been developed under the excellent leade rship of Dr. William Busse, Panel Chair. The NHLBI is grateful for the tremendous dedication of time and outstanding work of all the members of theexpert panel, and for the advice from an expert consultant group in developing this report. Sincere appreciation is also extended to the NAEPP CC and the Guidelines Implementation Panel as well as other stakeholder groups (professional societies, voluntary health, government, consumer/patient advocacy organizations, and industry) for their invaluable comments during the public review period that helped to enhance the scientific credibility and practical utility of this document. Ultimately, the broad change in clinical practice depends on the influence of local primary care physicians and other health professionals who not only provide state-of-the-art care to their patients, butalso co mmunicat et o their peers the importance of doing the same. The NHLBI and its partners will forgenew initiatives based on these guidelines to stimulat eadoption of the recommendations at all levels, but particularly with primary care clinicians at the community level. We ask for the assistance of every reader in reaching our ultimate goal: improving asthma care and the quality of life for every asthma patient with asthma Gregory Morosco, Ph.D., M.P .H. James Kiley, Ph.D. Director Director Division for the Application of Research Discoveries Division of Lung Diseases National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute x Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of AsthmaMore than 22 million Americans have asthma, and it is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood, affecting an estimated 6 million children. The burden of asthma affects the patients, their families, and society in terms of lost work and school, lessened quality of life, and avoidable emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Improved scientific understanding of asthma has led to significant improvements in asthma care, and the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) has been dedicated to translating these research findings into clinical practice through publicatio nand dissemination of clinical practice guidelines. The first NAEPP guidelines were published in 1991, and updates were made in 1997, 2002, and now with the current report. Important gains have been made in reducing morbidity and mortality rates due to asthma; however, challenges remain. T he NAEPP hopes that the \"Expert Panel Repor t3: Guid elines the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma\u2014Full Report 2007\" (EPR\u20143 : Full Report 2007) will support the efforts of those who already incorporate best practices andwill help enlist even greater numbers of primary care clinicians, asthma specialists, health care systems and providers, and communities to join together in making quality asthma care available to all people who have asthma. The goal, simply stated, is to help people with asthma control their asthma so that they can be active all day and sleep well at night. This EPR\u20143: Summary Report 2007 presents the key recommendations from the EPR\u20143: Full Report 2007 (See www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/asthma/ asthg dln. htm). Detailed recommendations, the levels of scientific evidence upon which they are based, citations from the published scientific literature, discussion of the Expert Panel's rationale for the recommendations, and d escription of methods used todevelop the report are included in that resource docume nt. Because EPR\u20143: Full Report 2007 is an updat eof previous NAEPP guidelines, highlights of major changes in the update are presented below, and figure 1 presents a summary of recommended key clinical activities. 1 IntroductionIntroduction 2 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of AsthmaHIGHLIGHTS OF MAJOR CHANGES IN EPR\u20143: FULL REPORT 2007 The following are highlights of major changes. Many recommendations were updated or expanded based on new evidence. See EPR\u20143: Full Report 2007 for key differences at the beginning of each section and for a full discussion. New focus on monitoring asthma control as the goal for asthma therapy and distinguishing between classifying asthma severity and monitoring asthma control. ISeverity: the intrinsic intensity of the disease process. Assess asthma severity to initiate therapy. IControl: the degree to which the manifestations of asthma are minimized by therapeutic interventions and the goals of therapy are met. Assess and monitor asthma control to adjust therapy. New focus on impairment and risk as the two key domains of severity and control, and multiple measures for assessment. The domains represent different manifestations of asthma, they may not correlate with each other, and they may respond differentially to trea tment. IImpairment: frequency and intensity of symptoms and functional limitations the patient is experiencing currently or has recently experienced. IRisk: the likelihood of either asthma exacerbations, progressive decline in lung function (or, for children, lung growth), or risk of adverse effects from medication. Modifications in the stepwise approach to managing asthma long term. ITreatment recommendations are presented for three age groups (0-4 years of age, 5-11 years of age, and youths 12 years of age and adults). The course of the disease ma ychange over time; the relevance of different measures of impairment or risk and the potential short- and long-term impact of medications may be age related; and varied levels of scientific evidence are available for these three a ge groups. IThe stepwise approach expands to six steps to simplify the actions within each step. Previous guidelines had several progressive actions within different steps; these are now separated into different steps. IMedica tions have been repositioned within the six steps of care. \u2014Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) continue as preferred long-term control therapy for all ages. \u2014Combination of long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and ICS is presented as an equally preferred option, with increasing the dose of ICS in step 3 care, in patients 5 years of age or older. This approach balances the established beneficial effects of combination therapy in older children and adults with the increased risk for severe exacerbations, although uncommon, associated with daily use of LABA. \u2014Omalizuma bis recommended for consideration for youths 12 years of age who have allergies or for adults who require step 5 or 6 care (severe asthma). Clinicians who administer omalizumab should be prepared and equipped to identify and treat anaphylaxis that may occur.3 IntroductionNew emphasis on multifaceted approaches to patient education and to the control of environmental factors or comorbid conditions that affect asthma. IPatient education for a partnership is encouraged in expanded settings. \u2014 Patient education should occur at all points of care: clinic settings (offering separate self-management programs as well as integrating education into every patient visit), Emergency Departments (EDs) and hospitals, pharmacies, schools and other community settings, and patients' homes. \u2014Provider education should encourage clinician and health care systems support of the partnership (e.g., through interactive continuing medical education, communication skills training, clinical pathways, and information system supports for clinical decisionmaking. IEnvironmental control includes several strategies: \u2014Multifaceted approaches to reduce exposures are necessary; single interventions are generally ineffective. \u2014Consideration of subcutaneous immunotherapy for patients who have allergies at steps 2-4 of care (mild or moderate persistent asthma) when there is a clear relationship between symptoms and exposure to an allergen to which the patient is sensitive. Clinicians should be prepared to treat anaphylaxis that may occur. \u2014Potential benefits to asthma control by treating comorbid conditions that affect asthma. Modifications to treatment strategies for managing asthma exacerbations. These changes: ISimplify the classification of severity of exacerbations. For the urgent or emergency care setting: <40 percent predicted forced expira toryvolume in expira toryflow (PEF) indicates severe exacerba tion and potential benefit use of adjunctive therapies; 70 percent predicted FEV1or PEF is a goal for discharge from the emergency care setting. IEncoura ge development of prehospital protocols for emergency medical services to allow administration of albuterol, oxygen, and, with medical oversight, anticholinergics and oral systemic corticosteroids. IModify recommendations on medications: \u2014 Add levalbuterol. \u2014 Add magnesium sulfate or heliox for severe exacerbations unresponsive to initial treatments. \u2014Emphasize use of oral corticosteroids. Doubling the dose of ICS for home management is not effective. \u2014Emphasize tha tanticholinergics are used in emergency care, not hospital care. \u2014 Add consideration of initiating ICS at discharge.4 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of AsthmaFigure 1. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDED KEY CLINICAL ACTIVITIES FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA Clinical Issue Key Clinical Activities Action Steps DIAGNOSIS Establish asthma diagnosis. MANAGING ASTHMA LONG TERM Assessment and MonitoringFour Components of Care Assess asthma severity to initiate therapy. Assess asthma control to monitor and adjust therapy. Schedule followup care.Use severity classification chart, assessing both domains of impairment and risk,to determine initial treatment. Use asthma control chart, assessing both domains of impairment and risk, to determine if therapy should be maintained or adjusted (step up if necessary, step down if possible). Use multiple measures of impairment and risk: different measures assess different manifestations of asthma; the ymaynot correlate with each other; and they may respond differently to therapy. Obtain lung function measures by spirometry at least every 1-2 years, more frequently for not-well-controlled asthma. Asthma is highly variable over time, and periodic monitoring is essential. In general, consider scheduling patients at 2- to 6-week intervals while gaining control; at 1-6 month intervals, depending on step of care required or duration of control, to monitor if sufficient control is maintained; at 3-month intervals if astep down in therapy is anticipated. Assess asthma control, medication technique, written asthma action plan, patient adherence and concerns at every visit.Use medical history and physical examination to determine that symptoms of recurrent episodes of airflow obstruction are present. Use spirometry in all patients 5years of age to determine that airway obstruction is at least partially reversible. Consider alternative causes of airway obstruction. Goal of asthma therapy is asthma control: IReduce impairment (prevent chronic symptoms, require infrequent use of short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA), maintain (near) normal lung function and normal activity levels). IReduce risk (prevent exacerbations, minimize need for emergency care or hospitalization, prevent loss of lung function, or for children, prevent reduced lung growth, have minimal or no adverse effects of therapy). Education Provide self-management education. Teach and reinforce: ISelf-monitoring to assess level of asthma control and signs of worsening asthma (either symptom or peak flow monitoring shows similar benefits f or most patients). Peak flow monitoring may be particularly helpful for patients who have difficulty perceiving symptoms, a history of severe exacerbations, or moderate or severe asthma. IUsing written asthma action plan (review differences between long-term control and quick-relief medication). ITaking medication correctly (inhaler technique and use of devices). IAvoiding environmental factors that worsen asthma. Tailor education to literacy level of patient. Appreciate the potential role of a patient' scultural beliefs and practices in asthma management.5 IntroductionFigure 1. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDED KEY CLINICAL ACTIVITIES FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA (continued) Clinical Issue Key Clinical Activities Action Steps Education (continued Develop a written asthma action plan in partnership with patient. Integrate education into all points of care where health professionals interact with patients.Agree on treatment goals and address patient concerns. Provide instructions for (1) daily management (long-term control medication, if appropriate, and environmental control measures) and (2) managing worsening asthma (how to adjust medication, and know when to seek medical care). Involve all members of the health care team in providing/reinforcing education, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, and asthma educators. Encourage education at all points of care: clinics (offering separate self- management education programs as well as incorporating education into every patient visit), Emergency Departments and hospitals, pharmacies, schools and other community settings, and patients' homes. Use a variety of educational strategies and methods. Control Environmental Factors and Comorbid conditions MedicationsRecommend measures to control exposures to allergens and pollutants or irritants tha tmake and asthma worse. Treat comorbid conditions. Select medication and delivery devices to meet patient's needs and circumstances.Determine exposures, history of symptoms in presence of exposures, and sensitivities (In patients who have persistent asthma, use skin or in vitro testing to assess sensitivity to perennial indoor allergens.). Advise patients on ways to reduce exposure to those allergens and pollutants, or irritants to which the patient is sensitive. Multifaceted approaches are bene- ficial; single steps alone are generally ineffective. Advise all patients and preg- nant women to avoid exposure to tobacco smoke. Consider allergen immunotherapy, by specifically trained personnel, for patients who have persistent asthma and when there is clear evidence of a relationship between symptoms and exposure to an allergen to which the patient is sensitive. Consider especially: allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis; gastroesophageal reflux, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, rhinitis and sinusitis, and stress or depression. Recognition and treatment of these conditions may improve asthma control. Consider inactivated influenza vaccine for all patients over 6 months of age. Use stepwise approach (See below.) to identify appropriate treatment options. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the most effective long-term control therapy. When choosing among treatment options, consider domain of relevance to the patient (impairment, risk, or both), patient's history of response to the medication, and patient's willingness and ability to use the medication.Four Components of Care (continued)6 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of AsthmaFigure 1. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDED KEY CLINICAL ACTIVITIES FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA (continued) Clinical Issue Key Clinical Activities Action Steps General Principles for All Age GroupsIncorporate four components of care. Initiate therapy based on asthma severity. Adjust therapy based on asthma control.Include medications, patient education, environmental control measures, and management of comorbidities at each step. Monitor asthma control regularly (See above, assessment and monitoring.). For patients not taking long-term control therapy, select treatment step based on severity (See figures on stepwise approach for different age groups.). Patients who have persistent asthma require daily long-term control medication. Once therapy is initiated, monitor the level of asthma control and adjust therapy accordingly: step up if necessary and step down if possible to identify the minimum amount of medication required to maintain asthma control. Refer to an asthma specialist for consultation or comanagment if there are difficulties achieving or maintaining control; step 4 care or higher is required (step 3 care or higher for children 0-4 years of age); immunotherapy or omalizumab is considered; or additional testing is indicated; or if the patient required 2 bursts of oral systemic corticosticosteroids in the past year or a hospitalization.Stepwise Approach Young children may be at high risk for severe exacerbations, yet have low levels of impairment between exacerbations. Initiate daily long-term control therapy f or: IChildren who had 4episodes of wheezing the past year that lasted >1 da yand affected sleep AND who have a positive asthma risk profile, either (1) one of the following: parental history of asthma, physician diagnosis of atopic derma titis,or evidence of sensitization to aeroallergens OR (2) of the following: sensitization to foods, 4percent blood eosinophilia, or wheezing apart colds. Consider for >4 weeks. IChildren who have two exacerbations requiring oral systemic corticosteroids within 6 months. If no clear and positive response occurs within 4-6 weeks and the patient's/caregiver's medication technique and adherence are satisfactory, stop the treatment and consider alternative therapies or diagnoses. If clear benefit is sustained for at least 3 months, consider step down to evaluate the continued need for daily therapy. Children this age have high rates of spontaneous remission of symptoms.Ages 0-4 Years Consider daily long-term control therapy. Monitor response closely, and adjust treatment.7 IntroductionFigure 1. SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDED KEY CLINICAL ACTIVITIES FOR THE DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA (continued) Clinical Issue Key Clinical Activities Action Steps Stepwise Approach (continued) Address child's concerns, preferences, and school schedule in selecting treatments. Encourage students to take a copy of written asthma action plan to school/ afterschool activities. Treat exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB) (See below .) Step up daily therapy if the child has poor endurance or symptoms during normal play activities. Treatment will not alter underlying progression of the disease, but a step up in therapy may be required to maintain asthma control. Address youth's concerns, preferences, and school schedule in selecting treatment. Encourage students to take a copy of written asthma action plan to school/afterschool activities. Treat EIB. Step up daily therapy if the child has poor endurance or symptoms during normal daily activities. Establish reversibility with a short course of oral systemic corticosteroids. Consider, for example: calcium and vitamin D supplements for patients who take ICS and have risk factors for osteoporosis; increased sensitivity to side effects of bronchodilators with increasing age; increased drug interactions with theophylline; medications for arthritis (NSAIDs), hypertension, or glaucoma (beta blockers) may exacerbate asthma.Ages 5-11 Years Involve child in developing a written asthma action plan. Promote physical activity. Monitor for disease progression and loss of lung growth. Involve youths in developing written asthma action plan. Promote physical activity. Assess possible benefit of treatment in older pa tients. Adjust medications to address coexisting medical conditions common among older pa tients. Treatment strategies to prevent EIB include: ILong-term control thera antagonists (LTRAs), cromolyn or nedocromil; frequent or chronic use of long acting beta 2-agonist (LABA) for pretreatment is discouraged, as it may disguise poorly controlled persistent asthma. IWarmup period or a mask or scarf over the mouth for cold-induced EIB.Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm (EIB)Prevent EIB Monitor asthma control during all prenatal visits; asthma worsens in one-third of women during pregnancy and improves in one-third; medications should be adjusted accordingly. It is safer to be treated with asthma medications than to have poorly controlled asthma. Maintaining lung function is important to ensure oxygen supply to the fetus. Albuterol is the preferred SABA. ICS is the preferred long-term control medication (Budesonide is preferred because more data are available on this medica tion during pregnancy .).Pregnancy Maintain asthma control through pregnancy. Assess asthma control prior to surgery. If lung function is not well controlled, provide medications to improve lung function. A short course of oral systemic corticosteroids may be necessary. For patients receiving oral systemic corticosteroids during 6 months prior to surgery, and for selected patients on high dose ICS, give 100 mg hydrocortisone ever y8hours intravenously during the surgical period, and reduce the dose rapidly within 24 hours after surgery.Surgery Reduce risks for complications during and after surger y.Ages 12 and Older8 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of AsthmaFigure 1.

Treat to relieve hypoxemia and airflow obstruction; reduce airway inflammation. Monitor response. Discharge with medication and pa tient educationDefinition and Pathophysiology Asthma is a complex disorder characterized by variable and recurring symp toms, airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and an underlying inflammation. The interaction of these features determines the clinical manifestations and severity of asthma (See figure 2, \"The Interplay and Interaction Between Airway Inflammation and the Clinical Symptoms and Pathophysiology of Asthma.\") and the response to treatment. The working definition of asthma is as follows: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in whichmanycells and ce llular elements p lay a role: in particular, mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils (especially in sudden onset, fatal exacerbations, occupational asthma, and p atients who smoke), T lymphocytes, macrophages, and epithelial cells. In susceptible individuals, this inflam- mation causes recurrent episodes of coughing (particularly at night or early in the morning), wheezing, breathlessness, and chest tightness. These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment.Airflow limitation is caused by a variety of changes in the air way, all in influenced by airway inflamation: IBronchoconstriction\u2014bronchial smooth muscle contraction that quickly narrows the airways in response to exposure to a variety of stimuli, including allergens or irritants. IAirway hyperresponsiveness\u2014an exaggerated bronchoconstrictor response to stimuli. IAirway edema\u2014as the disease becomes more persistent and inflammation becomes more progressive, edema, mucus hypersecretion, and formation of inspissated mucus plugs further limit airflow. Remodeling of airways may occur. Reversibility ofairflo wlimitation may be incomplete in some patients. Persistent changes in airway structure occur, including sub-basement fibrosis, mucus hypersecretion, injury to epithelial cells, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and angiogenesis. Recent studies provide insights on different phenotypes of asthma that exist. Different manifestations of asthma may have specific and varying patterns of inflammat ion (e.g., varying intensity, cellular mediator pattern, and therapeutic response). Further studies will determine if different treatment approaches benefit the different patterns of inflammation. 9 Asthma Definition and Implications for TreatmentFigur e2.THE INTERPLAY AND INTERACTION BETWEEN AIRWAY INFLAMMATION AND THE CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF ASTHMA Inflammation Airway Hyperresponsiveness Clinical SymptomsAirway ObstructionAsthma Definition and Implications for Treatment Causes of Asthma The development of asthma appears to involve the interplay be tween host factors (particularly genetics) and environmental exposures that occur at a crucial time in the development of the immune system. A definitive cause of the inflammatory process leading to asthma has not yet been established. IInnate immunity. Numerous factors may affect the balance between Th1-type and Th2- type cytokine responses in early life and increase the likelihood that the immune response will downregulate the Th1 immune response that fights infection and instead will be dominated by Th2 cells, leading to the expression of allergic diseases and asthma. This is known as the \"hygiene hypothesis,\" which postulates that certain infections early in life, expos ure to other children (e.g., presence of older sibling sand earl yenrollment in childcare, which have greater likelihood of exposure to respiratory infection), less frequent use of antibiotics, and \"country living\" is associated with a Th1 response and lower incidence of asthma, whereas the absence of these factors is associated with a persistent Th2 r esponse and higher rates of asthma. Interventions to prevent the onset of this process (e.g., with probiotics) are under study, butno recommendations can yet be made. IGenetics. A sthma has an inheritable component, butthe ge netics inv olved remain complex. As the linkage of genetic factors to different asthma phenotypes becomes clearer, treatment approaches maybecome directed to specific patient phenotypes and genotypes. IEnvironmental factors. \u2014 Two major factors are the most important in the development, persistence, and possibly the severity of asthma: airborne allergens (particularly sensitization and exposure to house-d ust mit eand A lternaria) and viral respiratory infections (including respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] and rhinovirus).\u2014 Other environmental factors are under study: tobacco smoke (exposure in utero is associated with an increased risk of wheezing, but it is not certain this is linked to subsequent development of asthma), air pollution (ozone and particular matter) and diet (obesity or low intake of antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids). The association of these factors with the onset of asthma has not been clearly defined. A number of clinical trials have investigated dietary and environmental manipulations, but these trials have not been sufficiently long term or conclusive to permit recommendations. Implications for Treatment Knowledge of the importance of inflammation to the central featur es of asthma continues to expand and underscores inflammation as a primary target of treatment. Studies indicate that current therapeutic approaches are effective in controlling symptoms, reducing airflow limitation, and preventing exacer bations, but currently available treatments do not appear t oprevent the progression of asthma in children. As various phenotypes of asthma are defined and inflammatory and genetic factors become more appare nt, new therapeutic approaches may be developed that will allow even greater specificity to tailor treatment to the individual patient's needs and circumstances. 10 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of AsthmaT o establish a diagnosis of asthma, the clinician should determine that symptoms of recurrent episodes of airflow obstruction or airway hyperresponsiveness are present; airflow obstruction is at least partially reversible; and alternative diagnoses are excluded.IEpisodic symptoms of airflow obstruction or airway hyperresponsiveness are present. IAirflow obstruction is at least partially reversible, measured by spirometry. Reversibility is deter- mined by an increase in FEV1of >200 mL and 12 percent from baseline measure after inhalation of short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA). Some studies indicate that an increase of 10 percent of the predicted FEV1after inhalation of a SABA may have higher likelihood of separating patients who have asthma from those who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). IAlternativ ediagnoses are excluded. See discussion below. Recommended methods to establish the diagnosis are: IDetailed medical history. See figure 3, \"Suggested Items for Me dical History,\" for questions to include. IPhy sical examinat ion mayreveal finding sthat increase the probability o f asthma, but the absenc eofthese finding sdoes not rule out asthma, because the disease is variable and signs may be absent between episodes. The examination focuses on: \u2014upper respiratory tract polyp; \u2014c h e s t ( s o u n d s o f w h e e z i n g d u r i n g n o r m a l breathing or prolonged phase of forced exhalation, hyperexpansion of the thorax, use of accessory muscles, appearance of hunched shoulders, chest deformity); and \u2014 skin (atopic dermatitis, eczema). ISpirometry can demonstrate obstruction and assess reversibility in patients 5years of age. Patients' perceptions of airflow obstruction are highly variable. Spir ometry is an essential objective measure to establish the diagnosis of asthma, 11 Diagnosis of AsthmaKEY SYMPTOM INDICATORS FOR CONSIDERING ADIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA The presence of multiple key indicators increases the proba bility of asthma, but spirometry is needed to establish adiagnosis. IWheezing\u2014high-pitched whistling sounds when breathing out\u2014especially in children. A lack of wheezing and a normal chest examination do not exclude asthma. IHistory of any of the following: \u2014Cough (worse particularly at night) \u2014Recurrent wheeze \u2014Recurrent difficulty in breathing \u2014Recurrent chest tightness ISymptoms occur or worsen in the presence of: \u2014Exercise \u2014Viral infection \u2014Inhalant allergens (e.g., animals with fur or hair, house-dust mites, mold, pollen) \u2014Irritants (tobacco or wood smoke, airborne chemicals) \u2014Changes in wea ther \u2014Strong emotional expression (laughing or crying hard) \u2014Stress \u2014Menstrual cycles ISymptoms occur or worsen a tnight, awakening the patient.Diagnosis of Asthma 12 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthmabecause the medical history and physical examination are not reliable means of excluding other diagnoses or of assessing lung status. Spirometry is generally recommended, rather than measurements by a peak flow meter, due to wide variability in peak flow meters and reference values. Peak flow meters are designed for monitoring, not as diagnostic tools. Adifferential diagnosis of asthma should be consider ed.Recurrent episodes of cough and wheezing most often ar e due to asthma in both children and adults; however, other significant causes of airway obstruction leading to wheeze must be considered both in the initial diagnosis and if there is no clear response to initial therapy. IAdditional studies are not routinely necessary but may be useful when considering alternative diagnoses. \u2014Additional pulmonary function studies will help if thereare q uestions ab out COPD (diffusing capacity), a restrictive defect (measures of lung volumes), or VCD (evaluation of inspiratory flow-volume loops). \u2014Broncho provocation with me thacholine, histamine, c old air, orexercise challeng e may be useful when asthma is suspected and spirometry is normal or near normal. For safety reasons, bronchoprovocation should be carried out only by a trained individual. A positive test is diagnostic for airway hyperre sponsiveness, which is a characteristic feature of asthma but can also be present in other conditions. Thus, a positive test is consistent with asthma, but a negative test may be more helpful to rule out asthma. \u2014Chest x ray may be needed to exclude other diagnoses. \u2014Biomarker sof inflammation arecurre ntly being evaluated f or their usefulness in the diagnosis and assessment of asthma.

Caution is needed to avoid giving young children inappropriate prolonged asthma therapy. However, it is important to avoid underdiagnosing asthma, and thereby missing the opportunity to treat a child, by using such labels as \"wheezy bronchitis,\" \"recurrent pneumonia,\" or \"reactive airway disease\" (RAD). The chronic airway inflammatory response and structural changes that are characteristic of asthma can develop in the preschool years, and appropriate asthma tr eatme nt will reduce morbidity. IConsider referral to an asthma specialist if signs and symptoms are atypical, if there are problems with a differe ntial diag nosis, or if additional testing is indicated. 14 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of AsthmaAchieving and maintaining asthma control requires four components of care: assessment and monitoring, education for a partnership in care, control of envi- ronmental factors and comorbid conditions that affect asthma, and medications. A stepwise approach to asthma management incorporates these four components, emp hasizing that pharmacologic therapy is initiated based on asthma severity and adjusted (stepped up or down) based on the level of asthma control. Special considerations of therapeutic options within the stepwise approach may be necessary for situations such as exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB), surgery, and pregnancy. Four Components of Asthma Care Compone nt 1: A ssessing and Monitoring Asthma Severity and Asthma Control The functions of assessment and monitoring are closely linked t o the c oncepts of severity, control, and responsiveness to treatment:ISeverity: the intrinsic intensity of the disease process. Se verity is most easily and directly measured in a patient who is not receiving long-term control therapy. Severity can also be measured, once asthma control is achieved, by the step of care (i.e., the amount of medication) required to maintain co ntrol. IControl: the degree to which the manifestations of asthma are minimized by therap eutic intervention and the goals of therapy are met. IResponsiveness: the ease with which asthma control is achieved b y therapy. Asthma severity and asthma control inc lude the domains of current impairment and future risk. IImpairment: frequency and intensity of symptoms and funct ional limitat ions the pat ient is curre ntly experiencing o r has recently experienced. 15 Managing Asthma Long TermManaging Asthma Long Term GOAL OF THERAPY: CONTROL OF ASTHMA Reduce Impairment IPrevent chronic and troublesome symptoms (e.g., coughing or breathlessness in the daytime, in the night, or after exertion). IRequire infrequent use ( 2days a week) of inhaled SABA for quick relief of symptoms (not including prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm [EIB]). IMaintain (near) normal pulmonary function. IMaintain normal activity levels (including exercise and other physical activity and attendance at school or work). IMeet patients' and families' expectations of and satisfaction with asthma care. Reduce Risk IPrevent recurrent exacerbations of asthma and minimize the need for ED visits or hospitaliza tions. IPrevent loss of lung function; for children, prevent reduced lung growth. IProvide optimal pharmacotherapy with minimal or no adverse effects of therapy. IRisk: the likelihood of either asthma exacerbations, progressiv e decline in lung function (or, for children, reduced lung growth), or risk of adverse effects from medication. This distinction emphasizes the multifaceted nature of asthma and the need to consider separately asthma's current, ongoing effects on the present quality of life and functional capacity and the future risk of adverse events. The two domains may respond differentially to treatment. For example, evidence demonstrates that some patients can have adequate control of symptoms and minimal day-to-day impairment, but still be at significant risk of exacerbations; these patients should be treated accordingly. The specific measures used to assess severity and control are similar: symptoms, use of SABAs for quick relief of symptoms, limitations to normal activities due to asthma, pulmonary function, and exacerbations. Multiple measures are important, because different measur es assess diff erent manifestations of the disease and ma ynot c orrelatewith each other. The concepts of severity and control are used as follows fo r manag ing asthma: IAssess sever ityto initiate therapy. Seesectio non \"Stepwise A pproach for Managing Asthma\" for figures on classifying asthma severity and initiating therapy in different age groups. During a patient's initial presentation, if the patient is not currently taking long-term control medication, asthma severity is assessed to guide clinical decisions for initiating the appropriate medication and other therapeutic interventions. IAssess control to adjust therapy. See section on \"Stepwise Ap proach for Managing Asthma\" for figures on assessing asthma control and adjusting therap yin different age groups. Once therapy is initiated, the emphasis for clinical management thereafter is changed to the assessment of asthma control. T he level of asthma control will guide decisions either to maintain or to adjust therapy (i.e., step up if necessary, step down if possible). IFor assessing a patient's overall asthma severity, once the most optimal asthma control is achieved and maintaine d,orfor population-based evalua- tions or clinical severity can be inferre dby correlating the level of severity with the lowest level of treatment required to maintain control.However, the emphasis for clinical management is to assess asthma severity prior to initiating therapy and then to assess asthma control for monitoring and adjusting therapy. For the initial assessment to characterize the patient's asthma and guid edecisions for init iating therapy, use informat ion from the diagnostic evaluation to: IClassify asthma severity. IIdentify precipitating factors for episodic symp- toms (e.g., exposur e at home, work, daycare, or school to inhalant allergens or irritants). IIdentify comorbid conditions that may impede asthma management (e.g., sinusit is, rhinitis, GERD, OSA, o besity, stress, or depression). IAssess the patient's knowledge and skills for self-manag ement. Forperiodic monitoring of asthma control to guide decisions fo r maintaining o r adjusting therapy: IInstruct patients to monitor their asthma control in an o ngoing manner. All patients should be taught howt or ecognize inadequate asthma control. \u2014E i t h e r s y m p t o m o r p e a k f l o w m o n i t o r i n g i s approp riate for most patients; evidence suggests the benefits are similar. \u2014 Consider daily peak-flow monitoring for patients who have moderate or severe persistent asthma, patients who have a history of severe exacerbations, and patients who poorly perceive airway obstruction or worsening asthma. IMonitor asthma control periodically in clinical visits, because asthma is hig hlyvariable over time andtherapy may need to be adjusted (stepped up if necessary, stepped down if possible). The frequency o fmonit oring is a matter of c linical judgment.

IMinimally invasive markers (called biomarkers) oxide (FeNO) and sputum eosinophils may be useful, but bio markers require further evaluation before they can be recommended as clinical tools for routine management.Component 2: Education for a Partnership in Care Apartnership between the clinician and the person who has asthma (and the caregi ver, for children) is required for effective asthma management. By working together, an appropriate treatment can be selected, and the patient can learn self-management skills necessary to control asthma. Self-management education improves patient outcomes (e.g., reduced urgent care visits, hospitalizations, and limitations on activities as well as improved health status, quality of life, and perceived control of asthma) and can be cost-effective. Self-management education is an integral component of effective asthma care and should be treated as such by health care providers as well as by health care policies and r eimbursements.

Provide to all patients a written asthma action plan that includes instructio ns for both daily management (long-term control medication, if appropr iate, and env ironmental control measures) and a ctions tomanag eworsening asthma (what signs, symptoms, and PEF measurements (if used) indicate worsening asthma; what medications to take in response; what signs and symptoms indicate the need for immediate medical care). Written asthma action plans are particularly recommended for patients who have moderate or severe persistent asthma (i.e., requiring treatment at step 4, 5, or 6), a history of severe exacerbations, or poorly controlled asthma. See figures 5 and 6 for samples of written asthma action plans. Integrate asthma self-management education into all aspects of asthma car e.Asthma self management requires repetition and reinforcement. It should: IBegin at the time of diagnosis and continue through followup care. See figure 7, \"Delivery of Asthma Educatio nbyClinicians During Patient Care Visits,\" for a sample of how to incorporate teaching into routine clinic visits. IInvolve all members of the health care team, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, and asthma educators, as well as other health professionals who come in contact with asthma pat ients and their families. IOccur at al lpoints of care where health care profes- sionals interact with patients who have asthma. The stro ngest evidence supports self-managementeducation in the clinic setting. Evidence also supports education provided in patients' homes, pharmacies, targeted education in EDs and hospi- tals, and selected programs in schools and other community sites. Proven community programs should be considered because of their potential to reach large numbers of people who have asthma and encourage \"asthma-friendly\" support from their families and community environments. IUse a variety of educational strategies to reach people who have varying levels of health literacy or learning styles. Individual instruction, group programs, written materials (at a 5th grade reading level or below), video- or audiotapes, and comput- er and Internet programs all provide effective educational opportunities.

Component 3: Control of Environmental Factors and Co morbid Condit ions That Affect Asthma If patients who have asthma are exposed to irritants or inhalant allergens to w hich they are sensitive, their asthma symptoms may increase and precipitate an asthma exacerbation. Substantially reducing exposure to these factors may reduce inflammation, symptoms, and need for medication. Several comorbid conditions can imp edeasthma management. Recognition and treatment of these conditions may improve asthma control.See questions in figure 3, \"Suggested Items for Medical History,\" above, for questions related to environmental exposures and comorbid conditions. Allergens and Irritants Evaluate the pot and irritants. IIdentify and irritant exposures. The most important allergens for bothchildren and adults appear to be those that are inhaled. IFor patients who have persistent asthma, use skin testing or in vitro testing to assess sensitivity to perennial indoor allergens. Assess the significance of positive tests in the context of the person's history of symptoms when exposed to the allergen. Advise patients who have asthma to reduce exposure to allerge ns and p ollutants or irritants to which they are sensitive. ISeefigure 9, \"How T o Control Things That MakeYour Asthma Worse,\" for a sample patient information sheet. IEffective allergen avoidance requires a multifaceted, comprehensive approach; single steps alone are generally ineffective. Multifaceted allergen-control education programs provided in the home setting can help patients reduce exposures to cockroach, dust-mite, and rodent allergens and, consequently, improve asthma control. IAdvise patients who have severe persistent asthma, nasal p olyps,orahistory of sensitivity to aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) about their risk of severe and even fatal exacerba- tions from using these drugs. IIndoor air-cleaning devices (high-efficiency particulate air [HEPA] and electrostatic precipitating filters), cannot substitute for more effective dust-mit eand cockroach control measures because FIGURE 7.

The devices can reduce airborne dog and cat allergens, mold spores, and particulate tobacco smoke; however, most studies do not show an effect on symptoms or lung function. IUse of humidifiers or evaporative (swamp) coolers is not generally recommended in homes of patients who are sensitive to dust mites or mold. Consider subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy for patients who have pe rsistent asthma when there is clear evidence of a relationship between symptoms and exposure to an allergen to which the patient is sensitive. Evidence is strongest for use of subcuta- neous imm unothe rapy for single allergens, particularly house dust mites, animal dander, and pollen. The role of allergy in asthma is greater in children than in adults. If use of allergen immunotherapy is elected, it should b eadministered only in a physician's office where facilities and trained personnel are available to treat any life-threatening reaction that can, but rarelydoes,occur. Consider inactivated influenza vaccination for patients who have asthma. This v accine is safe for administration to c hildren over 6 months of age and adults, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Pract ices ofthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends vaccination for per- sons who have asthma because they are considered to bea tr isk forcomplications from influenza. However, the vaccine should not be given with the expectation that it will reduce either the frequency or severity of asthma exacerbations during the influenza season. Dietary factors have an inconclusive role in asthma. Food allergenies are rarely an aggravating factor in asthma. Anexcept ion is that sulfites in foods (e.g., shrimp ,dried fruit, processed potatoes, beer, and wine) can precipitate asthma symptoms in people who aresensit iveto these food items. Furthermore, individuals who have both food allergy and asthma are at increased risk for fatal anaphlylactic reactions tothe f oodtowhichtheyaresensitized. Comorbid Conditions Identify and treat comorbid conditions that may impe de asthma management. If these conditions are treated appropriately, asthma control may improve. IAllergic Bronchopulmonar y Aspergillosis (ABPA) may be considered in patients who have asthma and a history of pulmonar y infilt rates,immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization to Aspergillus, and/or are corticosteroid dependent. Diagnostic criteria include: positive immediate skin test and elevated serum IgE and/or IgG to Aspergillus, total serum IgE (1,000 ng/mL), and central bronchiectasis. Treatment is prednisone, initially 0.5 mg per kilogram with gradual tapering. Azole antifungal agents as adjunctive therapy may also be helpful. IGastroesophageal Reflux (GERD) treatment may benefit patients who hav e asthma and complain of frequent heartburn or pyrosis, particularly those who have frequent nighttime asthma symptoms. Even in the absence of suggestive GERD symptoms, consider evaluation for GERD in patients who have poorly controlled asthma, especially with nighttime symptoms. Treatment includes: avoid- ing heavy meals, fried foods, caffeine, and alcohol; avoiding food and drink within 3 hours of retiring; elevating the head of the bed on 6- to 8-inch blocks; using proton pump inhibitor medication. IObese or overweight patients who have asthma maybe advised that weight loss, in addition to improving overall health, might also improve asthma control. IObstructiv eSleepApnea (OSA) maybeconsidered in patients who have not wel l controlled asthma, particularly those who are overweight or obese. Treatme nt for OSA is nasal continuous positive air waypressure (CPAP). However, this treatment may disrupt the sleep of asthma patients who do not also have OSA. Accurate diagnosis is important. IRhinitis or sinusitis symptoms or diagnosis should beevaluated in patients w ho have asthma, because the interrelationship of the upper and lower airwa ysuggests that therapy for the upper airway will improve asthma control. Treatment of allerg ic rhinit is includes intranasal corticosteroids, antihistamine therapy, and sinusitis includes intranasal cort icoste roids and antibiotics. Evidence is inconclusive regarding the effect on asthma of sinus surgery in patients who have chronic rhinosinusitis. IStress and depression should b econsidered in patie nts who ha ve asthma that is not well controlled. Additional education to improve self-manageme nt and coping skills may be helpful.26 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of AsthmaFIGURE 9. HOW TO CONTROL THINGS THAT MAKE YOUR ASTHMA WORSE You can help prevent asthma episodes by staying away from things that make your asthma worse. This guide suggests many ways to help you do this. You need to find out what makes your asthma worse. Some things that make asthma worse for some people are not a problem for others. You do not need to do all of the things listed in this guide. Look at the things listed below. Put a check next to the ones that you know make your asthma worse, particularly if you are allergic to these things. Then, decide with your doctor what steps you will take. Start with the things in your bedroom that bother your asthma. Try something simple first. Tobacco Smoke IIIf you smoke, ask your doctor for ways to help you quit. Ask family members to quit smoking, too. IIDo not allow smoking in your home, car or around you. IIBe sure no one smokes at a child's daycare center or school.Dust Mites Many people who have asthma are allergic to dust mites. Dust mites are like tiny \"bugs\" you cannot see that live in cloth or carpet. Things tha t will help the most: IIEncase your mattress in a special dust-mite proof cover.* IIEncase your pillow in a special dust-mite proof cover* or wash the pillow each week in hot water. Water must be hotter than 130 \u00b0F to kill the mites. Cooler water used with detergent and bleach can also be effective. IIWash the sheets and blankets on your bed each week in hot water. Other things that can help: IIReduce indoor humidity to or below 60 percent, ideall y 30-50 percent. Dehumidifiers or central air conditioners can do this. IITry not to sleep or lie on cloth-covered cushions or furniture. IIRemove carpets from your bedroom and those laid on concrete, if you can. IIKeep stuffed toys out of the bed, or wash the toys weekly in hot water or in cooler water with detergent and bleach. Placing toys weekly in a dryer or freezer may help. Prolonged exposure to dry heat or freezing can kill mites but does not remove allergen. *To find out where to get products mentioned in this guide, call: Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (800-727-8462) Allerg y & Asthma Network Mothers of Asthmatics (800-878-4403) American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (800-822-2762) National Jewish Medical and Research Center (Lung Line) (800-222-5864) American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (800-842-7777)27 Managing Asthma Long TermAnimal Dander Some people are allergic to the flakes of skin or dried saliva from animals. The best thing to do: IIKeep pets with fur or hair out of your home. If you can't keep the pet outdoors, then: IIKeep the pet out of your bedroom, and keep the bedroom door closed. IIRemove carpets and furniture covered with cloth from your home. If that is not possible, keep the pet out of the rooms where these are. Cockroach Many people with asthma are allergic to the dried droppings and remains of cockroaches. IIKeep all food out of your bedroom. IIKeep food and garbage in closed containers (Never leave food out). IIUse poison baits, powders, gels, or paste (for example, boric acid). You can also use traps. IIIf a spray is used to kill roaches, stay out of the room until the odor goes away. Vacuum Cleaning IITry to get someone else to vacuum for you once or twice a week, if you can. Stay out of rooms while they are being vacuumed and for a short while afterward. IIIf you vacuum, use a dust mask (from a hardware store), a central cleaner with the collecting bag outside the home, or a vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter or a double-layered bag.* Indoor Mold IIFix leaking faucets, pipes, or other sources of water. IIClean moldy surfaces. IIDehumidify basements if possible.Pollen and Outdoor Mold During your allergy season (when pollen or mold spore counts are high): IITry to keep your windows closed. IIIf possible, stay indoors with windows closed during the midday and afternoon, if you can. Pollen and some mold spore counts are highest at that time. IIAsk your doctor whether you need to take or increase anti-inflammatory medicine before your allergy season starts. Smoke, Strong Odors, and Sprays IIIf possible, do not use a wood-burning stove, kerosene heater, fireplace, unvented gas stove, or heater. IITry to stay away from strong odors and sprays, such as perfume, talcum powder, hair spray, paints, new carpet, or particle board. Exercise or Sports IIYou should be able to be active without symptoms. See your doctor if you have asthma symptoms when you are active\u2014such as when you exercise, do sports, play, or work hard. IIAsk your doctor about taking medicine before you exercise to prevent symptoms. IIWarm up for a period before you exercise. IICheck the air quality index and try not to work or play hard outside when the air pollution or pollen levels (if you are allergic to the pollen) are high. Other Things That Can Make Asthma Worse IISulfites in foods: Do not drink beer or wine or eat shrimp, dried fruit, or processed potatoes if they cause asthma symptoms. IICold air: Cover your nose and mouth with a scarf on cold or windy days. IIOther medicines: Tell your doctor about all the medicines you may take. Include cold medicines, aspirin, and even eye drops. Key: HEPA, high-efficiency particulate airComponent 4: Medications Medications for asthma are categorized into two general classes: long-term control medication and quick-relief medication. Selection of medications includes consideration of the general mechanisms and role of the medication in therapy, delivery devices, and safety. General Mechanisms and Role in Therapy Long-term co ntrol medications are used daily to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. The most effective are those that attenuate the underlying inflammation characteristic of asthma. Long-term control medications include the following (listed in alphabetical order): ICorticosteroids are anti-inflammatory medications that reduce airway h yperresponsiveness, inhibit inflammator y cell migration and activation, and block late phase reaction to allergen. Inhaled Corticosteriods (ICSs) are the most consistently effective long-term control medication at all steps ofcare for persistent asthma, and ICSs improve asthma control more effectively in both children and adults than leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) or any other single, long-term control medicat ion do. ICSs reduce impairment and risk of exacerbations, but ICSs do not appear to alter the progr essio n or underlying severity of the dis- ease in children. Short courses of oral systemic corticosteroids are often used to gain prompt con- trol of asthma. Oral systemic corticosteroids are used long term to treat patients who require step 6 care (for severe persistent asthma). ICromolyn sodium and nedocromil stabilize mast cells and interf ere with chloride channel function. They are used as alternative, but not preferred, medication for patients requiring step 2 care (for mild p ersistent asthma). They also can be used as preventive treatment before exercise or unavoidable exposur e to known allergens. IImmunomo dulators. Omalizumab (ant i-IgE) is a monoclonal antibo dy that prevents binding of IgE to the high-affinity receptors on basophils and mast cells. Omalizumab is used as adjunctive therapy for patients 12 years of age who have sensitivity to relevant allergens (e.g., dust mite, cockroach, cat, or dog) and who require step 5 or 6 care (for severe persistent asthma). Clinicians who administer omalizumab should be prepared and equipped to identify and treat anaphylaxis that may occur.ILeukotriene modifiers interfere with the pathway of leukotrie ne mediators, which are released from mast cells, eosinophils, med- are alter native, but not prefer red, ther apy for the treatment of patients who require step 2 care (for mild persistent asthma). LTRAs also can be used as adjunctive therapy with ICSs, but for youths 12 years of age and adults, they are not preferred adjunctive therapy compared to the addition of LABAs. LTRAs can attenuate EIB. Zileuton can be used as alternative, but not preferred, adjunctive therapy in adults; liver function monitoring is essential. ILABAs (salmeterol and formoterol) are inhaled bronchodilat ors that have a duration of bronchodilation of at least 12 hours after a single dose. \u2014L A B A s a r e n o t t o b e u s e d a s m o n o t h e r a p y f o r long-t erm control of asthma. \u2014L A B A s a r e u s e d i n c o m b i n a t i o n w i t h I C S s f o r long-term control and prevention of symptoms in moderate or severe persistent asthma (Step 3 care or higher in children 5 years of age and adults and St ep 4 care or higher in children 0-4 years of age, although few data are available for 0-4-year-olds.). \u2014 Of the adjunctive therapies available, LABA is the preferred therapy to combine with ICS in youths 12 years of age and adults. \u2014A L A B A m a y b e u s e d b e f o r e e x e r c i s e t o p r e v e n t EIB, but duration of action does not exceed 5 hours with chronic, regular use. Frequent or chronic use before exercise is discouraged, because this may disguise poorly controlled persistent asthma. See also the section \"Safety Issues for Inhaled Corticosteroids and Long- Acting Beta2-Agonists.\" IMethylxanthines. Sustained-release theophylline is a mild to moderat e bronchodilator used as alternative, not preferred, therapy for step 2 care (for mild persistent asthma) or as adjunctive therapy with ICS in patients 5 years of age. Theophylline may have mild anti-inflammatory effects. Monitoring of serum theophylline concentration is essential. 28 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma29 Managing Asthma Long TermQuick-relief medications are used to treat acute symptoms and exacerbations. They include the following (listed in alphabetical order): IAnticholinergics inhibit muscarinic cholinergic recepto rs and tone of the air- way. Ipratropium bromide provides additive benefit to SABA in moderate or severe exacerbations in the emergency care setting, not the hospital setting. Ipratropium bromide may be used as an alternative bronchodilator for patients who do not tolerate SABA, although it has not been compared to SABAs. ISABAs \u2014albuterol, levalbuterol, and pirbuterol\u2014are bronchodilato rs that relax smooth muscle. They are the treatment of choice for relief of acute symptoms and prevention of EIB. Increasing use of SABA treatment or the use of SABA >2 days a week for symptom relief (not prevention of EIB) generally indicates inadequate asthma control and the need for initiating or intensifying anti-inflammatory therapy. Regularly scheduled, daily, chronic use of SABA is not r ecommended. ISystemic corticosteroids. Although not short- acting, or al systemic corticosteroids are used for moderate and severe exacerbations in addition to SABA to speed recovery and to prevent recurrence of exacerbations. Complementary and alternative medications (CAMs) and inte rventio ns g enerally have insuffi- cient evidence to permit recommendations. Because as much as one-third of the U .S. population uses com- plementary alternative healing methods, it is important to discuss their use with patients. IAsk patients about all the medications and interventions they are using. Some cultural beliefs and pra ctices may be of no harm and can be integrated into the recommended asthma manag ement strategies, but it is important to advise patients that alternative healing methods are not substitutes for recommended therapeutic approaches. Clinical trials on safety and efficacy are limited, and their scientific basis has not been established. IEvidence is insufficient to recommend or not recommend most CAMs or treatments for asthma. These include chiropractic therapy, homeopathy and he rbal medicine, and breathing or relaxatio n techniques. Acupuncture is not recommended for the treatment of asthma.IPatients who use herbal treatments for asthma should be cautioned about the potential for harmful ingredients and f or interactions with recommended asthma medications. Delivery Devices for Inhaled Medications Patients should be instr ucted in the use of inhaled medications, and patients' technique should be reviewed at every patient visit. The major advantages of delivering drugs directly into the lungs via inhalation are that higher concentrations can be delivered more effectively to the airways and that systemic side effects are lessened. Inhaled medications, or aerosols, are available in a variety of devices that differ in the technique required. See figure 10, \"Aerosol Delivery Devices,\" for a summary of issues to consider for different devices. Safety Issues for Inhaled Corticosteroids and Long- Acting Beta2-Agonists Inhaled Corticosteroids IICSs are the p referr ed long-term control therapy in children of all ages and adults. In general, ICSs are well tolerated and safe at the recommended dosages. IMost benefits of ICS for patients who have mild or moderate asthma o ccur at the low- to medium-dose ranges. Data suggest higher doses may further reduce the risk of exacerbations. Furthermore, highe r doses are beneficial for patients who have more severe asthma. The risk of adverse effects increases with the dose. IHigh doses of ICS administered for prolonged periods of time (e.g., >1 year) have significantly less potential than oral systemic corticosteroids for having adverse effects. High doses of ICS used for prolonged periods of time (e.g., >1 year), particu- larly in combination with frequent courses of oral corticosteroids, may be associated with risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts or reduced bone density. Slit-lamp eye exam and bone densitometry may be considered. For adult patients, consider supplements of calcium and vitamin D, particularly in perimenopausal women. For children, age- appropriate dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D should be reviewed with parents or caregivers. IT o reduce the potential for adverse effects, the following measures are recommended. \u2014A d v ise pat ients to use spacers or VHCs with nonbreath-activated metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) to reduce local side effects. There are no clinical data on use of spacers with ultrafine particle hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) MDIs. \u2014 Advise patients to rinse the mouth (rinse and spit) after inhalation. \u2014 Use the lowest dose of ICS that maintains asthma control. Evaluate the patient's inhaler technique and adherence, as well as environ- mental control measures, before increasing the dose. \u2014 Consider adding a LABA, or alternative adjunctive therapy, to a low or medium dose of ICS rather than using a higher dose of ICS to maintain asthma control. Inhaled Corticosteroids and Linear Growth in Children IThe potential risks of ICSs are well balanced by their benefits. IPoorl y controlled asthma may delay growth. Children who have asthma tend to have longer periods of reduced growth rates before puberty. IGrowth rates are highly variable in children. Short-ter m evaluation may not be predictive of final adult height attained. IThe potential for adverse effects on linear growth from ICS appear to be dose dependent. In treatme nt of children who have mild or moderate persistent asthma, low-to medium-dose ICS therapy may be associated with a possible, but not predictable, adverse effect on linear growth (app roximately 1 cm). The effect on growth velocity appears to occur in the first several months of treatment and is generally small and not progressive. The clinical significance of this potential systemic effect has yet to be determined. IIn general, the efficacy of ICSs is sufficient to out weigh any concerns about growth or other systemic effects. However, ICSs should be titrated to as low a dose as needed to maintain good control of the child's asthma, and children receiving ICSs should be monitored for changes in growth by using a stadiometer. Long-Ac ting Beta2-Agonists IThe additio n of LABA (salmeterol or formoterol) to the treatment of patients who require more than low-d ose ICS alone to co ntrol asthma improves lung function, decreases symptoms, reduces exacerbations and use of SABA for quick relief in most patients to a greater extent than doubling the dose of ICSs. IA large clinical trial comparing daily treatment with salmeterol or placebo added to usual asthma therapy resulted in an increased risk of asthma- related deaths in patients treated with salmeterol (13 deaths among 13,176 patients treated for 28 weeks with salmeterol versus 3 deaths among 13,179 patients treated with placebo). In addition, increased numbers of severe asthma exacerbations were noted in the pivotal trials submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for formoterol approval, particularly in the arms of the trials with higher dose formoterol. Thus, the FDA determined that a Black Box warning was warranted on all preparations containing a LABA. IThe established beneficial effects of LABA for the great majority of patients who require more therap y than lo w-dose ICS alone to control asthma (i.e., requir e step 3 care or higher) should be weighed against the increased risk for severe exacerbations, although uncommon, associated with the daily use o f LABAs. IDaily use of L ABA generally should not exceed 100 mcg salmeterol or 24 mcg formoterol. IIt is not currently recommended that LABA be used for treatment of acute symptoms or exacerbations. ILABA s are not to be used as monotherapy for long- term control. Patients should be instructed not to stop ICS therapy while taking LABA, even though their symptoms may significantly improve. Stepwise Appr oach for Managing Asthma Principles of The Ste pwise Appro ach A stepwise approach to managing asthma is recom- mended to gain and maintain c ontrol of asthma in both the impairment and risk domains. These domains may respond differentially to treatment.

Under laboratory conditions, open- mouth technique (holding MDI 2 inches away from open mouth) enhances delivery to the lung. This technique, however, has not been shown to enhance clinical benefit consistently compared to closed- mouth technique (inserting MDI mouthpiece between lips and teeth). Tight seal around mouthpiece and slightly more rapid inhalation than standard MDI (see above) followed by 10-second breathhold.Slow inhalation and coordination of actuation during inhalation may be difficult, particularly in young children and elderly. Patients may incorrectly stop inhalation at actuation. Deposition of 50-80 percent of actuated dose in oropharynx. Mouth washing and spitting is effective in reducing the amount of drug swallowed and absorbed systemically. Lung delivery under ideal conditions varies significantly between MDIs due to differences in formulation (suspension versus solution), propellant (chlorofluorocarbon [CFC] versus hydrofluoralkane [HFA]), and valve design. For example, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) delivery varies from 5-50 percent. May be particularly useful for patients unable to coordinate inhalation and actuation. May also be useful for elderly patients. Patients may incorrectly stop inhalation at actuation. Cannot be used with currently available spacer/valved holding chamber (VHC) devices.Therapeutic Issues Dry powder inhaler (DPI) Corticosteroids Anticholinergics4 Rapid 1-2 seconds), deep inhalation. Minimally effective inspirator y flow is device dependent. Most children <4 years of age may not generate sufficient inspiratory flow to activate the inhaler.Dose is lost if patient exhales through device after actuating. Delivery may be greater or lesser than MDI, depending on device and technique. Delivery is more flow dependent in devices with highest internal resistance. Rapid inhalation promotes greater deposition in larger central airways. Mouth washing and spitting is effective in reducing amount of drug swallowed and a bsorbed. Spacer or valved holding chamber (VHC)4 years old <4 old VHC with face maskSlow (30 L/min or 3-5 seconds) followed by breathhold following actuation. Actuate only once into spacer/VHC per inhalation. If face mask is used, it should have a tight fit and allow 3-5 inhala tions per actuation. Rinse plastic VHCs once a month with low concentration of liquid household dishwashing detergent (1:5,000 or 1-2 drops per cup of water) and let drip dry.Indica ted for patients who have difficulty performing adequa te MDI technique. May be bulky. Simple tubes do not obviate coordinating actuation and inhala tion. The VHCs are preferred. Face mask allows MDIs to be used with small children. However, use of a face mask reduces delivery to lungs by 50 percent. The VHC improves lung delivery and response in patients who have poor MDI technique. The effect of a spacer or VHC on output from an MDI depends on both the MDI and device type; thus data from one combination should not be extrapolated to all others. Spacers and/or VHCs decrease oropharyngeal deposition and thus decrease risk of topical side effects (e.g., thrush). Spacers will also reduce the potential systemic a vailability of ICSs with higher oral absorption. However, spacer/VHCs may increase systemic availability of ICSs that are poorly absorbed orally by enhancing delivery to lungs. No clinical data are available on use of spacers or VHCs with ultrafine-particle-generated HFA plastic non-anti-static VHCs with dilute household detergents to enhance delivery to lungs and efficacy. This effect is less pronounced for albuterol MDIs with HFA propellant than for albuterol MDIs with CFC propellant.

ICSs are the most consistently effective anti-inflammatory therapy for all age groups, at all steps of care for persistent asthma. \u2014 Selection among alternative treatment options is based on consideration of treatment effectiveness for the domain of particular relevance to the patient (impairment, risk, or both), the individual patient's history of previous response to therapies (sensitivity and responsiveness to different asthma medications can vary among patients), and the willingness and ability of the patient and family to use the medication. IOnce asthma control is achieved, monitoring and followup are essential, because asthma often varies over time. A step up in therapy may be needed, or a step down may be possible, to identify the minimum medication necessary to maintain control. 32 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of AsthmaFIGURE 10.

Nebulizers are as effective as MDIs plus VHCs for delivering bron- chodilators in the ED for mild to moderate exacerbations; data in severe exacerbations are limited.

Referral to an asthma specialist for consultation or comanagement is recommended if there are diffi- culties achieving or maintaining control of asthma, if the patient required >2 bursts of oral systemic corticosteriods in 1 year or has an exacerbation requiring hospitalization, if step 4 care or higher is required (step 3 care or higher for children 0-4 years of age), if immunotherapy or omalizumab is considered, or if additional testing is indicated. T o achieve control of asthma, the following sequence of activities is recommended: IFor patients who are not already taking long-term control medications, assess asthma severity and initiate therapy according to the level of severity. IFor patients who are already taking long-term control medications, assess asthma control and step up therapy if the patient's asthma is not well controlled on current therapy. Before stepping up, review the patient's adherence to medications, inhaler technique, and environmental control measures. IEvaluate asthma control in 2-6 weeks (depending on level of initial severity or control). \u2014 In general, classify the level of asthma control by the most severe indicator of impairment or risk. \u2014 The risk domain is usually more strongly associated with morbidity in young children than the impairment domain because young children are often symptom free between exacerbations. \u2014I f office spirometry suggests worse control than other measures of impairment, consider fixed obstruction and reassess the other measures. If fixed obstruction does not explain the lack of control, step up therapy, because low FEV1is a predictor of exacerbations. \u2014 If the history of exacerbations suggests poorer control than does assessment of impairment, reassess impairment measures, and consider a step up in therapy. Review plans for handling exacerbations and include the use of oral systemic corticosteroids, especially for patients who have a history of severe exacerbations. IIf asthma control is not achieved with the above actions: \u2014R e v i e w t h e p a t i e n t ' s a d h e r e n c e t o m e d i c a t i o n s , inhaler technique, environmental control measures (or whether there are new exposures), and management of comorbid conditions. \u2014 If adherence and environment control measures are adequate, then step up one step (if not well controlled ) or two steps (if very poorly controlled). \u2014 If an alternative treatment was used initially, discontinue its use and use the preferred treatment option before stepping up therapy. \u2014 A short course of oral systemic cortico- stero ids may be co nsidered to gain more rapid control for patients whose asthma frequently interrupts sleep or normal daily activities or who are experiencing an exacerbation at the time of assessment. \u2014 If lack of control persists, consider alternative diagnoses before stepping up further. \u2014 If the patient experiences side effects, consider different treatment options. To m a i n t a i n co n t ro l o f a s t h m a , re g u l a r f o l l ow u p co n - tact is esse ntial because asthma oft en varies over time. ISchedule patient contact at 1- to 6-month intervals; the interval will depend on such factors as the level or duration of asthma control and the level of treatment required. IConsider a step down in therapy once asthma is well controlled for at least 3 months. A step down is necessary to identify the minimum therapy required to maintain good control. A reduction in ther apy should be gradual and must be closely monitored. Studies are limited in guiding therapy reduction. I n general, the dose of ICS may be reduced 25 percent to 50 percent every 3 months to the lowest possible dose. IConsider seasonal periods of daily long-term control therapy for patients who have asthma symptoms only in relation to certain seasons (e.g., seasonal pollens, allergens, or viral respiratory infections) and who have intermittent asthma the rest of the year. This approach has not been rigorously evaluated; close monitoring for 2-6 weeks after therapy is discontinued is essential to assure sustained asthma control. Stepwise Treatment Recommendations for Diff erent Ag es Recommendations for treatments in the different steps are prese nted in three different age groups (0-4 years, 5-11 years, and 12 years and older) because the course of the disease may change over time, the relevance of measures of impairment or risk and the potential short- and long-term impact of medications may be age related, and varied levels of scientific evidence are available for the different ages. Steps for Children 0-4 Years of Age See figure 13, for rec ommended t reatments in the different steps and figures 17-19 for recommended medication dosages. In addition to the general principles of the stepwise approach, special consider- ations for this age group include initiating therapy, selecting among treatment options, and monitoring response to therapy. The init iatio n of daily long-term c ontrol therapy in children ages 0-4 years is recommended as follows: IIt is recommended for reducing impairment and risk of exacerbations in infants and young children who had four or more episodes of wheezing in the past year that lasted more than 1 day and affected sleep AND who have a positive asthma predictive inde x (either (1) one of the following: a parental history of asthma, a physician's diagnosis of atopic dermatitis, or evidence of sensitization to aeroallergens; OR (2) two of the following: evidence of sensitization to foods, >4 percent peripheral blood eosinophilia, or wheezing apart from colds). IIt should be considered for reducing impairment in infants and young children who consistently require symptomatic treatment >2 days per week for a period of more than 4 weeks. IIt should be considered for reducing risk in infants and young c hildre n who have two exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids within 6 months.IIt may be considered for use only during periods, or seasons, of previously documented risk (e.g., during seasons of viral respiratory infections). The decision about when to start long-term daily therapy is difficult. The chronic airway inflammatory response in asthma can develop in the preschool years; for example, between 50-80 percent of children who have asthma developed symptoms before their fifth birthday. Adequate treatment will reduce the burden of illness, and underdiagnosis and undertreat- ment are key problems in this age group. Not all wheeze and cough are caused by asthma, however, and caution is needed to avoid giving inappropriate, prolonged therapy. Initiating long-term control therapy will depend on consideration of issues regarding diagnosis and prognosis. \u2014 Viral respiratory infections are the most common cause of asthma symptoms in this age group, and many children who wheeze with respiratory infections respond well to asthma therapy even though the diagnosis of asthma is not clearly established. For children who have exacerbations with viral infections, exacerba- tions are often severe (requiring emergency care or hospitalizat ion), y et the child has no significant symptoms in between these exacerbations. These children have a low level of impairment but a high level of risk. \u2014 Most young children who wheeze with viral respiratory infection experience a remission of symptoms by 6 years of age, perhaps due to growing airway size. \u2014 However, two-thirds of children who have frequent wheezing AND also have a positive asthma predictive index (see above) are likely to have asthma throughout childhood. Early identification of these children allows appropriate treatment with environmental control measur es and me dicatio n to reduce morbidity. Select medications with the following considerations for young childre n: IAsthma treatment for young children, especially infants, has not been studied adequately. Most recommendations are based on limited data and extrapolations from studies in older children and adults. Preferred treatment options are based on 34 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthmaindividual drug efficacy studies in this age group; comparator trials are not available. IThe following long-term control medications are FDA approved for the following ages in young children: ICS budesonide nebulizer solution (1-8 years of age); (DPI) (>4 years of age); LABA salmeterol DPI, alone or in with years of age); LTRA montelukast (chewable tablets, 2-6 years of age; granules, down to 1 year old). ISeveral delivery devices are available, and the doses received may vary considerably among devices and age groups. In general, children <4 years of age will have less difficulty with a face mask and either (1) a nebulizer or (2) an MDI with a VHC. (See figur e 10 above.) IICSs are the preferred long-term control medication for initiating therapy. The benefits of ICSs out weigh any concerns about potential risks of a small, nonpro gressive reduction in growth velocity or other possible adverse effects. ICSs, as with all medications, should be titrated to as low a dose as needed to maintain control. IFor childr en whose asthma is not well controlled on lo w-dose ICS, few studies are available on stepup therapy in this age group, and the studies have mixed findings. Some data on children 4 years old and younger show dose-dependent improvements in the domains of impairment and risk of exacerbation from taking ICS. Data from studies on LABA combined with ICS have only small numbers of 4-year-old children, and these data show improvement in the impairment but not risk domain. Adding a noncorticosteroid long-term control medication to medium-dose ICS may be considered before increasing the dose of ICS to high dose to avoid potential risk of side effects with high doses of medication. Monitor response to therapy closely, because treatme nt of y oung children is oft en in the form of a therapeutic trial. IIf a clear and beneficial response is not obvious within 4-6 weeks and the patient's/family's med- ication technique and adherence are satisfactory, treatment should be stopped. Alternative therapies or alternative diagnoses should be considered.IIf a clear and beneficial response is sustained for at least 3 months, consider a step down to evalu- ate the need for continued daily long-term control therapy. Children in this age group have high rates of spontaneous r emission of symptoms. Steps for Children 5-11 Years of Age See figure 13, \"Stepwise Approach for Managing Asthma Long Term in C hildren, 0-4 Y ears of Age and 5-11 Y ears of Age,\" for recommended treatments in different steps and figures 17, 18, and 19 for recom- mended medication dosages. Special considerations for this age group include the following: Promote active participation in physical activities, exercise, and spo rts because physical activity is an essential part of a child's life. Treatment immediate- ly befor e vigorous activity usually prevents EIB (see section on \"Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm\"). However, if the child has poor endurance or has symptoms during usual play activities, a step up in the rapy is war ranted. Directly involve children 10 y ears of ag e (and younger children as appropriate) in developing their written asthma action plans and reviewing their adhere nce. This inv olvement may help address deve lopmental iss ues of emerging independence by building the children's confidence, increasing person- al responsibility, and gaining problem-solving skills. Encourag e parents to take a co py of the written asthma action plan to the student's school, or childcare or extended care setting, or camp. Consider the following when selecting treatment options: IICSs are the preferred long-term control therapy. The benefits of ICSs outweigh any concerns about potential risks of a small, nonprogressive reduction in growth velocity or other possible adverse effects. ICSs, as with all medications, should be titrated to as low a dose as needed to maintain control. High-quality evidence demonstrates the effective- ness of ICS in children 5-11 years of age, and comparator studies demonstrate improved control with ICS on a range of asthma outcomes compared to other long-term control medications. IStep up treatment options for children whose asth- ma is not well controlled on low-dose ICS have not been adequately studied or compared in this age group. The selection will depend on the domain 35 Managing Asthma Long Term36 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of AsthmaSAMPLE RECORD FOR MONITORING THE RISK DOMAIN IN CHILDREN: RISK OF ASTHMA PROGRESSION (INCREASED EXACERBATIONS OR NEED FOR DAILY MEDICATION, OR LOSS OF LUNG FUNCTION), AND POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS OF CORTICOSTEROID THERAPY Patient name: Date ICS dail y dose* LTRA LABA Theophylline Other FEV1,f o r c e d e x p i r a t o r y v o l u m e i n 1 s e c o n d ; F V C ,f o r c e d v i t a l c a p a c i t y ; I C S ,i n h a l e d c o r t i c o s t e r o i d ; L A B A ,l o n g - a c t i n g b e t a2agonist; LTRA, leukotriene receptor antagonist *Consider ophthalmologic exam and bone density measurement in children using high doses of ICS or multiple courses of oral corticosteroids.Long-term control medication Significant exacerbations Long-term control medication Potential risk of adverse corticosteroid effects (as indicated by corticosteroid dose and duration Height, cm Percentile Plots of growth velocityof particular relevance (impairment, risk, or both) and clinician-patient preference. \u2014 For the impairment domain: Children who have low lung function and >2 days per week impairment may be better served by adding a LABA to a low dose of ICS (based on studies in older children and adults). Increasing the dose of ICS to medium dose can improve symptoms and lung function in those children who have greater levels of impairment (based on studies in children). One study in children suggests some benefit in the impairment domain with adding LTRA. \u2014 For the risk domain: Studies have not demonstrated that adding LABA or LTRA reduces exacerbations in children. Adding L ABA has the potential risk of rare life-threate ning or fatal exacerbations. Studies in older children and adults show that increasing the dose of ICS can reduce the risk of exacerbations, but this may require up to a four- fold increase in the d ose. T his dose may increase the potential risk of systemic effects, although the risk is small within the medium-dose range. IThe need for step 4 care usually involves children who have a low level of lung function contributing to their impairment. The combination of ICS and LABA is preferred, on the basis of studies in older children and adults. IBefore maintenance dose of oral corticosteroids is initiated in step 6, consider a 2-week course of oral corticosteroids to confirm clinical reversibility, measured by spirometry, and the possibility of an effective response to therapy. If the response is poor, a car eful review for other pulmonary conditions or comorbid conditions should be conducted to ensure that the primary diagnosis is severe asthma. Monitor asthma progression. Declines in lung func- tion o r repeat ed periods of worsening asthma impairment may indicate a progressive worsening of the underlying severity of asthma. Although there is no indicat ion that treatment alters the progression of the underlying disease in children, adjustments in tr eatme nt may be necessary to maintain asthma control.Steps for Youths 12 Years of Age and Adults See figure 16, \"Stepwise Approach for Managing Asthma in Y ouths 12 Y ear s of Age and Adults,\" for recommended treatment options in different steps and figures 18 and 19, for recommended medication dosages for youths 12 years of age and adults. Special considerations for this age group include the following: For youths: IInvolve adolescents in the development of their written asthma action plans and reviewing their adherence. IEncourage students to take a copy of their plan to school, after school programs, and camps. IEncourage adolescents to be physically active. For older adults: IConsider a short course of oral systemic corticosteroids to establish reversibility and the extent of possible benefit from asthma treatment. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema may coexist with asthma. IAdjust me dicatio ns as nec essar y to address coexisting medical conditions. For example, consider calcium and vitamin D supplements for patie nts who take ICS and have risk factors for osteoporosis. Consider increased sensitivity to side effects of bronchodilators, especially tremor and tachycardia with increasing age, and increased possibilities for drug interactions with theophylline. Consider also that NSAIDs prescribed for arthritis and the beta-blockers prescribed for hypertension or glaucoma may exacerbate asthma. IRevie w the patient's technique and adherence in using medications, and make necessary adjustments. Physical or cognitive impairments may make proper technique difficult. Consider the following when selecting treatment options: IRecommended treatment for step 3 weighs the high-q uality evidence demonstrating the benefits of adding L ABA to low-dose ICS against the potential risk of rare life-threatening or fatal exacerbations with the use of L ABA. The selection will depend on the domain of particular relevance (impair- ment, risk, or both) and clinician-patient preference. 37 Managing Asthma Long Term\u2014 Adding LABA more consistently results in improvements in the impairment domain compared to increasing the dose of ICS. \u2014 If the risk domain is of particular concern, then a balance of potential risks needs to be considered. A d d i n g L A B A t o l o w - d o s e I C S r e d u c e s t h e f r e - quency of exacerbations to a greater extent than doubling the dose of ICS, but adding LABA has the potential risk of rare life-threatening or fatal exacerbations. I n c r e a s i n g t h e d o s e o f I C S c a n s i g n i f i c a n t l y r e d u c e the risk of exacerbations, but this benefit may require up to a fourfold increase in the ICS dose. This dose may increase the potential risk of systemic effects, although the risk is small within the medium-dose range. IComparator studies demonstrate significantly greater improvements with adding LABA to ICS compared to other adjunctive therapies. IClinicians who a dministe r omalizumab are a dvised to be prepared and equipped for the identification and treatment of anaphylaxis that may occur, to observe patients for an appropriate period of time following each omalizumab injection (the optimal length of the observation is not established), and to educate patients about the risks of anaphylaxis and how to recognize and treat it if it occurs (e.g., using prescription auto injectors for emergency self treatment, and seeking immediate medical care). Managing Special Situations Patients who have asthma may encounter situations that will r equire adjustments to their asthma manage- ment to keep their asthma under control, such as EIB, pregnancy, and surgery. Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm EIB should be anticipated in all asthma pat ients. A history of cough, shortness of breath, chest pain or tightness, wheezing, or endurance problems during exercises suggests EIB. An exercise challenge, in w hich a 15 percent decr ease in P EF or FEV1 (measure d before and after exercise at 5-minute inter- vals for 20-30 minutes) will establish the diagnosis. An important dimension of adequate asthma controlis a patient's ability to participate in any activity he or she chooses without experiencing asthma symptoms. EIB should not limit either participation or success in vigorous activities. Recommended treatments for EIB include: ILong-term control therapy, if appropriate. Frequent or severe EIB may indicate the need to initiate or step up lo ng-term control medications. IPretreatment before exercise: \u2014 Inhaled beta2-agonists will prevent EIB for more than 80 percent of patients. SABA used shortly before exercise may be helpful for 2-3 hours. LABA can be protective up to 12 hours, but there is some shortening of the duration of protection when LABA is used on a daily basis. Frequent or chronic use of LABA as pretreat- ment for EIB is discouraged, as it may disguise poorly controlled persistent asthma. \u2014L TRAs, w ith an onset of action generally hours after administration, can attenuate EIB in up to 50 percent of patients. \u2014 Cromolyn or nedocromil taken shortly before exercise is an alternative treatment, but it is not as e ffectiv e as SAB As. \u2014 A warmup period before exercise may reduce the degree of EIB. \u2014A m a s k o r s c a r f o v e r t h e m o u t h m a y a t t e n u a t e cold-induced EIB. Pregnancy Maintaining asthma control d uring pregnancy is impo rtant for the health and well-being of both the mother and her baby. Maintaining lung function is important to ensure oxyg en supply to the fetus. Uncontrolled asthma increases the risk of perinatal mortality, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and low-birth-weight infants. It is safer for pregnant women to be treated with asthma medications than to have asthma symptoms and exacerbations. IMonitor the level of asthma control and lung functio n during prenatal visits. The course of asthma improve s in one-third of women and worsens for one-third of women during pregnancy. Monthly evaluations of asthma will allow the opportunity to step up therapy if necessary and to step down the rapy if possible. 38 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of AsthmaIAlbuterol is the preferred SABA. The most data related to safe ty during human pregnancy are available for abuterol. IICSs are the preferred long-term control medication. Budesonide is the preferred ICS because more data are available on using budesonide in pregnant wo men than are available on other ICSs, and the data are reassuring. However, no data indicate that the other ICS preparations are unsafe during pregnancy. Surgery Patients who hav e asthma ar e at risk for complica- tions during and after surgery. These complications include acut e bronchoconstriction triggered by intubation, hypoxemia and possible hypercapnia, impaired effectiveness of cough, atelectasis, and respiratory infection, and, if a history of sensitivity is present, reactions to latex exposure or some anesthe tic agents. The following actions are recommended to reduce the r isk of complicatio ns during surgery: IBefore surgery, review the level of asthma control, medicatio n use (especially oral systemic cortico- steroids within the past 6 months), and pulmonary function. IProvide medications before surgery to improve lung function if lung function is not well controlled. A short course of oral systemic corti costeroids may be necessary. IFor patients receiving oral systemic corticosteroids during the 6 months prior to surgery and for selected patients on long-term high-dose ICS, give 100 mg hydrocortisone every 8 hours intravenously during the surgical period, and reduce the dose rapidly within 24 hours after surgery. Disparities Multiple factors contribute to the higher rates of poorly c ontrolled asthma and asthma deaths among Blacks and Latinos compared to Whites. These factors include socioeconomic disparities in access to quality medical care, underprescription and under- utilization of long-term control medication, cultural beliefs and practices about asthma management, and perhaps biological and pathophysiological differences that affect the underlying severity of asthma and respo nse to tr eatment. Heightene d awareness ofdisparit ies and cultur al barriers, improving access to quality care, and improving communication strategies between clinicians and ethnic or racial minority patients regarding use of asthma medications may improve asthma outcomes. 39 Managing Asthma Long Term40 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of AsthmaFIGURE 11 .

The clinician must monitor the patient's response on several clinical parameters and adjust the dose accordingly. Once control of asthma is achieved, the dose should be carefully titrated to the minimum dose required to maintain control. IPrepara tions are not interchangeable on a mcg or per puff basis. This figure presents estimated comparable dail y doses. See EPR\u20143 Full Report 2007 for full discussion. ISome doses may be outside package labeling, especially in the high-dose range. Budesonide nebulizer suspension is the only inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with FDA-approved labeling for children <4 years of age. IFor children <4 years of age: The safety and efficacy of ICSs in children <1 year has not been established. Children <4 years of age generally require delivery of ICS (budesonide and fluticasone HFA) through a face mask that should fit snugly over nose and mouth and avoid nebulizing in the eyes. Wash face after each treatment to prevent local corticos- teroid side ef fects. For budesonide, the dose may be administered 1-3 times daily. Budesonide suspension is compatible with albuterol, ipratropium, and levalbuterol nebulizer solutions in the same nebulizer. Use only jet nebulizers, as ultrasonic nebulizers are ineffective for suspensions. For fluticasone HFA, the dose should be divided 2 times daily; the low dose for children <4 years of age is higher than for children 5-11 years of age due to lower dose delivered with face mask and data on efficacy in young children. Poten tial Adverse E MDIs and mouthwashing and spitting after inhalation decrease local side effects. IA number of the ICSs, including fluticasone, budesonide, and mometasone, are metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract and liver by CYP 3A4 isoenzymes. Potent inhibitors of CYP 3A4, such as ritonavir and ketoconazole, have the potential for increasing systemic concentrations of these ICSs by increasing oral availability and decreasing systemic clearance. Some cases of clinically significant Cushing syndrome and secondary adrenal insufficiency have been reported. IIn high doses, systemic effects may occur, although studies are not conclusive, and clinical significance of these effects has not been established (e.g., adrenal suppression, osteoporosis, skin thinning, and easy bruising). In low-to-medium doses, suppression of growth velocity has been observed in children, but this effect may be transient, and the clinical significance has not been esta blished.Child 0-4 Years of AgeChild 5-11 Years of Age12 Years of Age and AdultsLow Daily Dose Child 0-4 Years of AgeChild 5-11 Years of Age12 Years of Age and AdultsMedium Daily Dose Child 0-4 Years of AgeChild 5-11 Years of Age12 Years of Age and AdultsHigh Daily Dose50 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of AsthmaFIGURE 19.

Exacerbations are characterized by decreases in expiratory airflow; objective measures of lung function (spirometry or PEF) are more reliable indicators of severity than symptoms are. Individuals whose asthma is well controlled with ICSs have decreased risk of exacerbations. However, these patients can still be vulnerable to exacerbations, for example, when they have viral respiratory infections. Effec tive management of exacerbations incorporates the same four components of asthma management used in managing asthma long term: assessment and mo nitoring, patie nt ed ucation, environmental control, and medications. Classifying Severity Do not under estimat e the sever ity of an exace rba- tion. Severe exacerbations can be life threatening and can occur in patients at any level of asthma severity\u2014i.e., intermittent, or mild, moderate, or severe persistent asthma. See figure 20, \"Classifying Severity of Asthma Exacerbations in the Urgent or Emergency Care Setting. \" Patients at high risk of asthma-related death require special attention \u2014particularly intensive education, monitoring, and care. Such patients should be advised to seek medical care early during an exacer- bation. Risk factors for asthma-related death include: IPrevious severe exacerbation (e.g., intubation or ICU a dmissio n for asthma) ITwo or more hospitalizations or >3 ED v isits in the past year IUse of >2 canisters of SABA per month IDifficulty perceiving airway obstruction or the severity of worsening asthma ILow so cioec onomic status or inner-city residenceIIllicit drug use IMajor psychosocial problems or psychiatric disease IComorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease or other chronic lung disease Home Management Early treatment by the patient at home is the best strategy f or managing asthma exacerbations. Patients should be instructed how to: IUse a written asthma action plan that notes when and how to treat signs of an exacer bation. A peak flow-base d plan may be part icularl y useful for patients who have difficulty perceiving airflow obstruction or have a history of severe exacerbations. IRecogniz e early indicators of an exacerbation, including worsening PEF. IAdjust their medications by increasing SABA and, in some cases, adding a shor t course of oral systemic corticosteroids. Doubling the dose of ICSs is not effective. IRemove or withdraw from allergens or irritants in the env ironment that may contribute to the exacerbation. IMonitor response to treatment and promptly communicate with the clinician about any serious deter ioration in sy mptoms o r PEF or about decreased responsiveness to SABA treatment, including decreased duration of effect. The f ollow ing home manage ment techniques are not rec ommended because no studies demonstrate their effect iveness and they may delay patients from obtaining necessary care: drinking large volumes of liquids; b reathing warm, moist air; or using over-the- counter products, such as antihistamines or cold remedies. P ursed-lip and other forms of breathing may help to maintain calm, but these methods do not improve lung function.Managing Exacerbations 53 Managing Exacerbations54 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of AsthmaFIGURE 20.

If PEF is 50-79 percent, the patient should monitor response to quick-relief medication carefully and consider contacting a clinician. If PEF is below 50 percent, immediate medical care is usually required. In the urgent or emergency care setting, the following parameters describe the severity and likely clinical course of an exacerbation. Dyspnea interferes with or limits usual activityPEF 40-69 percent predictedor personal best PEF <40 percent predicted or personal best PEF <25 percent predicted or personal bestDyspnea at rest; interferes with conversation Too dyspneic to speak; perspiring Management in the Urgent or Emergency Care and Hospital Settings Emergency medical services providers should have prehospital protov ols that al low administration of SABA, supplemental oxygen, and (with appropriate medical oversight) anticholinergics and oral systemic corticosteriods to patients who have signs or symp- toms of an asthma exacerbation. Treatme nt strategies for managing moderate or severe exacerbations in the urgent or emergency care setting are describe d below. Also see figure 21 for a detailed sequence of recommended actions for monitoring and treatment and figure 22 for dosages of drugs for asthma exacerbations.IAdminister supplemental oxygen to correct signifi- cant hypoxemia in mo derate or severe exacerbations. IAdminister or continuous administra- tion of SABA to reverse airflow obstruction rapidly. IAdminister oral systemic corticosteroids to decrease airway inflammatio n in moderate or sever e exacerbations or for patients who fail to respond promptly and completely to SABA treatment.

For optimal delivery, dilute aerosols to minimum of 3 mL at gas flow of 6-8 L/min. Use large volume nebulizers for continuous administration. May mix with ipratropium nebulizer solution. In mild-to-moderate exacerbations, MDI plus VHC is as effective as nebulized therapy with appropriate administration technique and coaching by trained personnel. Has not been studied in severe asthma exacerbations. Do not mix with other drugs. Has not been studied in severe asthma exacerba tions.

Studies have examined ipratropium bromide MDI albuterol MDI dose; thought to be potent as albuterol on a mg basis.See albuterol MDI dose. Has not been studied in severe asthma exacerba tions No single measure is best for assessing severity or predicting hospital admission. Lung function measures (FEV1or PEF) may be useful for children 5 years of age, but these measur es may not be obtainable during an exacerbation. Pulse oximetry may be useful for assessing the initial sever ity; a repeated measure of pulse oximetry of <92-94 percent after 1 hour is predictive of the need for hospitalization. Signs and symptoms scores may be helpful. Children who have signs and symptoms after 1-2 hour s of initial treatment and who continue to meet the criteria for a moderate or severe exace rbation have a >84 percent chance of requiring hospitalization. \u2014 For adults: Repeated lung function measures (FEV1or PEF) at 1 hour and beyond are the strongest single predictor of hospitalization. Such measures may not be helpful, or easily obtained, during severe exacerbations. Pulse oximetry is indicated for patients who are in severe distress, have FEV1or PEF <40 pe rcent predicted, or are unable to perform lung function measures. Only repeat assessments after initial treatment, not a single assessment upon admission, are useful for predicting the need for hospitalization. Signs and symptoms scores at 1 hour after initial treatments improve the ability to predict need for hospitalization. The presence of drowsiness is a useful predictor of impending respirator y failure and is reason to consider immediate transfer to a facility equipped to offer ventilatory support. 57 Managing ExacerbationsFIGURE 22. DOSAGES OF DRUGS FOR ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS (continued) Medication Child Dose* Adult Dose Comments (not all inclusive)Dosage Ipratropium with albuterol Nebulizer solution (Each 3 mL vial contains 0.5 mg ipratropium bromide and 2.5 mg albuterol.)

The addition of ipratropium to albuterol has not been shown to provide further benefit once the patient is hospitalized. Should use with VHC and face mask for children <4 years.Anticholinergics (continued) Prednisone Methylprednisolone Prednisolone1-2 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (maximum = 60 mg/day) until PEF is 70 percent of predicted or personal best40-80 mg/day in 1 or 2 divided doses until PEF reaches 70 percent of predicted or personal bestFor outpatient \"burst,\" use 40-60 mg in single or 2 divided doses for total of 5-10 da ys in adults (children: 1-2 mg/ f da ys).Systemic Corticosteroids (Apply to all three corticosteriods.) * Children 12 years of age Key: ED, chamber Notes: There is no known advantage for higher doses of corticosteroids in severe asthma exacerbations, nor is there any advantage for intravenous administration over oral therapy provided gastrointestinal transit time or absorption is not impaired. The total course of systemic corticosteroids for an asthma exacerbation requiring an ED visit of hospitalization may last from 3 to 10 days. For corticosteroid courses of less than 1 week, there is no need to taper the dose. For slightly longer courses (e.g., up to 10 days), there probably is no need to taper, especially if patients are concurrently taking ICSs. ICSs can be started at any point in the treatment of an asthma exacerbation.IConsider adjunctive treatments, such as intravenous magnesium sulfate or heliox, in severe exac erbations, if patients are unresponsive to the initial treatments listed above (e.g., FEV1or PEF <40 percent predicted or personal best after initial treatments). IProvide the following to prevent relapse of the exacerbation and recurrence of another exacerbatio n: \u2014Referral to followup asthma care within 1-4 weeks. In addition, encourage the patient to contact (e.g., by telephone) his/her asthma care provider during the first 3-5 days after discharge. A followup visit is essential to review the patient's written asthma action plan, adherence, and environmental control and to consider a step up in therapy. If appropriate, consider referral to an asthma self-management education program. \u2014 An ED asthma disc harg e plan. See figure 23a, b \"Emergency Department\u2014Asthma Discharge Plan.\" \u2014Review of inhaler technique whenever possible. \u2014 Consideration of initiating ICS. ITreatment s that are not recommended in the emergency care or hospital setting include: methy lxanthines, antobiotics (ex cept as needed for chest physical therapy, mucolytics, or sedation. Inhaled ipratropium bromide is a helpful adjunctive therapy in the emergency care setting, but does not provide additional benefit after a patient is hospitalized for a severe exacerbation. 58 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma59 Managing ExacerbationsFIGURE 23a.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT\u2014ASTHMA DISCHARGE PLAN: HOW TO USE YOUR METERED-DOSE INHALER Clean your inhaler as needed, and know when to replace your inhaler. For instructions, read the package insert or talk to your doctor, other health care provider, or pharmacist.Using an inhaler seems simple, but most patients do not use it the right way. When you use your inhaler the wrong way, less medicine gets to your lungs. For the next few days, read these steps aloud as you do them or ask someone to read them to you. Ask your doctor, nurse, other health care provider, or pharmacist to check how well you are using your inhaler. Use your inhaler in one of the three ways pictured below (A or B are best, but C can be used if you have trouble with A and B). (Your doctor may give you other types of inhalers.) Steps for Using Your Inhaler A. Hold inhaler 1 to 2 inches in front of your mouth (a bout the width of two fingers).C. Put the inhaler in your mouth. Do not use f or steroids.B. Use a spacer/holding chamber. These come in many shapes and can be useful to any patient. Getting ready 1. Take off the cap and shake the inhaler. 2. Breathe out all the way. 3. Hold your inhaler the way your doctor said (A, B, or C below). Breathe in slowly 4. As you start breathing in slowly through your mouth, press down on the inhaler one time. (If you use a holding chamber, first press down on the inhaler. Within5 seconds, beg in to breathe in slowl y.) 5. Keep breathing in slowly, as deeply as you can. Hold your breath 6. Hold your breath as you count to 10 slowly, if you can. 7. For inhaled quick-relief medicine (short-acting beta2agonists), wait about 15-30 seconds between puffs. There is no need to wait between puffs for other medicines.For More Information The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Health Information Center (HIC) is a service of the NHLBI of the National Institutes of Health.
