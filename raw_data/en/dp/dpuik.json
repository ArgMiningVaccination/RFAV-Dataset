Interviews were conducted withelders and medicine men of the Cherokee Nations. Achecklist of twenty-five herbs was used to identifywhether or not the Cherokees had currently beenimplementing any of these treatments. Chronicles ofcurrent medical research have been studied to ascertainif any of these uses have been being medicallyresearched today. A manual has been developed whichcovered herbal background history, Cherokee uses,treatment values, plant identifications, currentresearch experiments, and medicinal healing. Acurriculum guide, plant identification chart, andoverhead projector sheets of the plants have also beenmade using the information from the manual. Thesematerials have had possibilities for use in a collegehealth course, a workshop on medicinal uses of plants 11 Herbalviand herbs, or a class for studying the culture andplant usage of the Cherokee Nations. Herbal1 INTRODUCTION Herbal2 INTRODUCTIONMedical treatment using herbs has been recognizedas being older than man's intelligence. Such herbaltreatment has been seen in animals' instinctive use ofplants to help cure certain ailments. For example, adog hunted a special grass to eat when it has becomeill, a mother bear has dressed a wound on her cub withleaves, and a horse lacking vitamins and minerals haseaten certain plants and bark from trees (Weiner,1972).Today people have continued to use herbs withmedicinal chemicals daily, usually without realizingthe values of such plants. Herbal tea, a populardrink, has contained fluoride, a chemical used inpreventing tooth decay. Coca-Cola was originally basedon an herbal remedy used for headaches. Aspirin wascreated from two plants: white willow and meadowsweet.Often, however, even with these examples, lack ofknowledge has prevented health professionals and healtheducators from teaching or supporting herbal healing.Nevertheless, the World Health Organization hasestimated that two-thirds of the world's population has 14 Herbal3 depended on healing herbs for primary medicines(Castleman, 1991).Tyler (1986) stated, \"Folk medicine is worthy ofscientific research: after all, scientists discoveredmorphine from opium poppy, digoxin from the foxglove,and ergotamine from the ergot fungus by observing theefficacy of ancient folk remedies.\"STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEMResearch has been conducted to identify, study,and review the twenty-five plants found in four stateparks in southwestern Indiana and the herbal remediesmade from these plants that were used by the Cherokeesduring the period dating from the early 19th centuryand continuing to the present. A study has been madeof the latest developments and usage of the identifiedplants and herbal remedies for Cherokee purposes,herbal background history, treatment values, medicinalhealing, plant identification, and current medicalresearch.PURPOSE OF STUDYThe purpose of this study has been to develop aCherokee herbal manual, including a curriculum guideandidentification charts of twenty-five plants found Herbal4 in the four state parks in southwestern Indiana and theherbal remedies made from these plants. These remedieshave been used by the Cherokees and by the Day familyduring the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.IMPORTANCE OF STUDYOften, the educational and training backgrounds ofhealth professionals, educators, and scientists havenot included the history and importance of herbhealing.Many professionals have been unfamiliar withthe effectiveness of Cherokee herbal remedies and theirsignificance.Yet, research has shown that a plantcalled St. Johns Wort inhibited the growth of theleukemia virus, the yew bark had potential to curebreast and ovarian cancer, and garlic has beeneffective in reducing cholesterol for heart disease(Castleman, 1991). Some of the common plants and herbsused by the Cherokee Nations, and found in the fourstate parks in southwestern Indiana, have been testedfor medicinal chemicals to combat some modern daydiseases.A manual has been needed that has identifiedand discussed Cherokee herbal remedies. Therefore,this manual will be beneficial, not only to theeducational profession, but also to those in sociology, Herbal5 in the sciences, and in health. Historical interest inCherokee remedies has peen worth recording, and thisdata has had the potential to develop into a collegehealth course, a workshop on the medicinal uses and theimportance of plants and herbal remedies, a specializedbotany class, or a social science class studying thecultural heritage and plant usage of the CherokeeNations.DELIMITATIONS 1.This study has been limited to twenty-fiveplants and herbs found in the four stateparks in southwestern Indiana. Specifically,these parks have included Harmonie StatePark, Lincoln State Park, Pike County StateForest, and Harrison-Crawford State Forest. 2.Only Cherokee herbal remedies that were usedby the Day family, ancestors of the author,have been studied. Since other Americannative groups also used plants and herbs, itwas essential to limit this study to oneNative American group. 3.The research has been limited to oraltraditions provided by elders and medicine Herbal6 men of the two Cherokee Nations that has beenrecorded.The two Nations have includedCherokee Village, North Carolina, andTahlequah, Oklahoma. 4.This manual has utilized only researchmaterials found in the institutions of higherlearning and public libraries in Indiana.ASSUMPTICNSThe researcher has assumed that the writtenresearch surveyed was valid and the interviews of theelders and medicine men have been honest and accurate.A manual has been developed that would enable aresearcher to identify and discuss the twenty-fiveCherokee herbal remedies and plants found growing insouthwestern Indiana State Parks.HYPOTHESISInformation has been gathered on the identifiedtwenty-five plants and herbs found in the southwesternIndiana state parks. These plants were used by theCherokees as herbal remedies and have been discussed inan informative manual. This manual has been able toincrease knowledge of the use of these identifiedplants and herbal remedies for the educational lb Herbal7 professions, as well as for scientists andsociologists.DEFINITION OF TERMS 1.Cherokee Nations has been used to refer totwo distinct groups of Cherokees, located intwo geographically different areas in theUnited States.2.Medicine man has been the term given by theCherokee people to a male who was speciallytrained in the use of herbs and spiritualguidance. 3.Elder has been used to refer to a Cherokeewho had earned the respect of the village.This person was no longer responsible for thewelfare of the village, but the nation soughtthis person's wisdom during future planning. 4.Herbs has referred to plants that havehealing qualities or medicinal value(Castleman, 1991).5.Herbal remedy has been used to refer to anyuse of an herb in the preparation of amedicine for the cure or prevention of anillness or disease. 19 Herbal8 METHODOLOGYThe materials that have been researched for themanual has included two components. First, a review ofavailable research books and articles on CherokeeNation herbal remedies used from 1850 to the presenthas been completed. Plants and herbs to be studiedhave been identified as those found in the state parksin southwestern Indiana. Those herbs have been used bythe Day Family and the Cherokees for medicinalpurposes.Since the Cherokee have tired many differentplants and herbs in their medical remedies, it wasexpedient to limit the study to only those plants andherbs found in the state parks of southwestern Indiana.Second, oral traditions provided by Cherokeeelders and medicine men of Cherokee Village, NorthCarolina, and Tahlequah, Oklahoma, have been obtainedand analyzed.This study has included interviews withseveral Cherokees at each site. To obtain the oraltraditions, a checksheet has been used. Data gatheredhas been analyzed, reviewed, and studied. Conclusions,information, and data have been developed into aresource manual that could be used for educationalclasses and presentations. This manual has included Herbal9 current medical research information, history ofmedicinal cures, plant identification, and a history ofCherokee herbal remedies. 21 CHAPTER IREVIEW OF LITERATURE Herbal11 Chapter IREVIEW OF LITERATURE Herbal healing has included four major traditions:Chinese, Ayurvedic (in India), Duropian (includingEgyptian), and American Indians (Native Americans)(Castleman, 1991). This paper has studied the use ofselected healing herbs of the Native American,particularly the Cherokee Indian Nations.Healing properties of plants have not changed;plants have had healing powers, and people havebenefitted from the accumulated wisdom gained from theuse of herbs through the ages. Of the 265 thousandspecies of plants throughout the world, only elevenhundred have be n thoroughly studied by Westernscientists.More than forty thousand additional plantsmight have had medical value for humans. Research,therefore, has had to focus on plants with usefulproperties (Linden, 1991).Today forty-seven percent of all prescriptionshave contained a drug from a natural plant source.According to Weiner (1972), the U.S. Pharmacopoeia haslisted 170 drugs made from plants that were used by the Herbal12 Native Americans. Today, on the average, physicianshave written eight prescriptions per day for drugs ofplant origin (Castleman, 1991).Early settlers came to America with herbalremedies used in Europe. However, they soon realizedthe native inhabitants of America, the Indians, knewhow to find, select, and preserve plants used to combdtspecific problems. The settlsirs were quick to acceptthese Indian herbal medical remedies. Because therelationship and communication between settlers andNative Americans were friendly during those times, itwas common to find Indian medicine men treating bothsettlers and natives with different plants and herbs.Valuable information on Indian herbal remedieshave come from written records of travelers,missionaries, botanists, and physicians. Of these themost complete and helpful has been the classic,American Medicinal Plants, written by Millspaugh (1892)who illustrated, painted, and reproduced 180 originalplates from living plants.According to Weiner (1972), herbs and early plantremedies used by the Indians were evaluated,classified, tested, and approved for the medical 24 Herbal13 profession.Three reference sources have recordedthose early herbal plant medicines and remedies: U.S.Pharmacopoeia, National Formulary, and The Dispensatoryof the United States.The Native Americans had a unique way ofexplaining how plants acquired medicinal properties. Aplaque at the Museum of the Cherokee Indian hadinscribed on it the following myth: \"Diseases werecreated long ago by animals in revenge for the abusesthey suffered from man. When the plants, who havealways been the friends of man, learned of theafflictions caused by the animals, they decided thatthey should counteract the evil designs. Each tree,shrub, and herb, down even to the grasses and mossesagreed to furnish a remedy for one of the diseases withthe promise'I shall appear to help man when he callsupon me in his need.' Thus did medicine originate, andevery plant has a use if only we knew it.\"The Indians used a process called \"Doctrine ofSignatures\" to decide which plants were valuable,useful, and worthwhile. This method identified thoseplants that were potent and best suited for collection.The doctrine theorized that medicinal herbs exhibited Herbal14 certain colors, smells, and shapes which resembledeither parts of the human body or the organism causingthe problem.To eliminate worms, a plant thatresembled a worm was used. For treatment of inflamedeyes, an herb that characterized the eyes was selected.This selection idea was used not only by the NativeAmericans but by early settlers and ancientpractitioners as well (Weiner, 1972). According toMooney (1982), when harvesting an appropriate plantspecies, the traditional Cherokee doctor passed thefirst three plants and then took the fourth but notbefore he offered a preliminary prayer, in which headdressed the \"Great Adawehi\" humbly asking permissionto take a small piece of its flesh. After the planthad been dug from the ground, he dropped a bead intothe hole and covered it over. This was a tokenrepayment to the plant spirit.Other methods of selection included trial anderror, tasting, sniffing, and relying on thesupernatural even though instead of a cure, a plantselection sometimes caused death. By the process ofelimination, the Indians discovered certain plants,flowers, bark, stems, roots, seeds, fruits, and nuts Herbal15 alleviated pain, speeded birth, cured ills, altered themind, and induced abortion. The Native Americans werealso experts at gathering, storing, preparing, andutilizing the different plant species. Annual plantswere dug before flowering, biennial herbs were gatheredin late fall when growth had ceased, and other plantswere collected when they were in the process of storingtheir nutrients before winter. Gathering duringcertain seasons preserved the plants' parts when theywere richest in medicinal properties. Some plants weredried for later use, and others were utilized in thefresh state.Roots and stems, if dried, were slicedand exposed to the air but were not placed in directsunlight.This process took three to six weeks,depending on the weather and nature of the plant parts.Bark was gathered when it slipped easily from the trunkor branches; the inner layer was most often used.Leaves were collected before blooming and dried in theshade.Flowers were used, but infrequently, in herbalmedicines; flowers, however, were preserved for use incertain sacred ceremonial rites. Fruits were picked atmaturity and either used in the fresh state or dried.Generally, seeds were harvested before seed pods 27 Herbal16 opened; nuts were collected and stored when mature. Thedried herbs were preserved by storing in dry, coolplaces, or by making them into different preparations.Herbal medicinal plants were prepared by boilingor steeping in water and were drunk as medicinal tea.Often, tea treatment was given one time during thecourse of an illness and then was not repeated;however, poultices and salves were often appliedseveral times to promote healing. Native Americansusually prepared herbal remedies by using only oneingredient or plant for each medicine; however, twoherbs were sometimes combined to create a single herbalremedy. Rarely did the Indians combine several herbsfor one medicine.Infusion was the most common way of preparingherbs.A small number of leaves or seeds were added toa minute amount of water and steeped for a few minutes.If the prepared herbal remedy was too bitter, otherplants or foods, such as honey, were added to improveflavor and taste.Harder and coarser herbs such as stems, bark, androots were gently simmered for several minutes untilabout one-third of the water had evaporated. The 28 Herbal17 process was called decoction; the mixture was drunk asherbal tea.Another way of preparing herbs was fermentation.An external application of herbs, made by soakingleaves, cloth, or skins in a preparation of the desiredtea, was applied to an affected area. Thispreparation, used to treat swelling, pains, colds, andthe flu, was applied as hot as could be toleratedwithout burning. It was allowed to cool and thenrepeated as necessary.To reduce swelling, a poultice of powdered herbswas made into a paste and then applied directly to theskin.Often, hot materials such as leaves or clothswere then placed over the paste at the affected areawhere they were left to cool. This procedure wasrepeated many times to reduce swelling, to relievepain, and to quiet muscle spasms.A plaster was sometimes used to prevent irritationto the skin.It differed from a poultice when powderedor wet herbs were placed between two leaves or piecesof cloth which was then applied to an affected area.This prevented the herbal remedy from coming intodirect contact with the skin. Herbal18 Finally, a salve was made by mixing and blendingpowdered herbs with types of animal fat or beeswax andcooking this mixture for a couple of hours. It wasthen applied to wounds. Because of the base materials,this mixture had the tendency to remain on the woundfor a longer period of time.These treatments used by the Native Americans insalecting, collecting, and preparing medicinal cureswere marveled at by the settlers, as well as by othermedical professionals, botanists, and missionaries(Weiner, 1972).Along with the medicinal use of plants, the NativeAmericans used spiritual guidance. The NativeAmerican's use of the term medicine was different fromthat of white society. To them it meant an array ofideas and concepts rather than just remedies andtreatment.Often when ordinary medicines, made fromplants, did not bring relief, the medicine man wascalled upon to help along the healing process. Heresorted to charms, prayers, dances, singing, shakingof rattles, and the beating of drums. In an oralinterview, Mr. Choogie Kingfisher, a full-bloodedCherokee and son of a medicine man, from Tahlequah, OK, 30 Herbal19 told of an unique tribal custom used by the Cherokeemedicine men.If a patient recovered through thespiritual guidance and medicinal preparations, a lockor strand of the patient's hair was given to themedicine man to be placed on a pole (spirit stick). Ofcourse, the more hair locks, the greater the healingpowers of the medicine man.The Native American Medicine Man, also called theShaman, was many things: a healer, a sorcerer, and aseer, an educator, as well as a priest. It was hisduty to know the properties of a variety of plants,what demons were present in the body, and to whom thedisease was attributed. He was equipped withparaphernalia and equipment appropriate to his calling..This included a special costume (usually animal skins),a medicine bundle that contained charms, a medicinestick, and a bag of herbs. Other equipment includeddrums, rattles, snake fangs, a hollow bone for sucking,a mortar and pestle for mixing medicines, and aanytimes a syringe for injecting medicine into wounds oradministering an enema (Vogel, 1970). This syringe wasmade from the hollow leg bone of a small bird, byaffixing a bladder of a small animal to the top of the 31 Herbal20 bone, and then sharpening the other end of the bone.Other important items of the medicine bundle were deertails and other animal parts. These medicinal bagswere handed down from father to a son or to a personappointed by the medicine man. They were veryimportant and contained not only herbs, equipment, andparaphernalia, but also charms that warded off evils(Vogel, 1970).Mr. Kingfisher also related that the full or true-blooded Cherokee medicine men live in a wide area inthe Northeastern part of Oklahoma. The full-bloods(about 30 thousand) have maintained authentic ways ofold in treating illnesses and disease. The medicinemen have continued to treat people by driving away evilspirits and by treating with medicinal plants andherbs.Medicinal plants were believed to derive theirstrength from ceremonies performed to make thempowerful.The Doctrine of Signatures provided \"like-cures\" and other pkants which were believed to bebeneficial to the system because they were distasteful.The distasteful plants were used to rid the body ofpoison.Consequently, foul-tasting medicine, emetics, 32 Herbal21 and purges were often used. Of course, the faith ofthe patient had much to do with recovery.The prayersand ceremonies were calculated to inspire confidence ofrecovery in the mind of the sick person and undoubtedlyreacted favorably upon the person's physical condition(Vogel, 1970).The Cherokees, during the 19th century, farmed,raised cattle, owned slaves, and raised cotton. Theyquickly adapted to white man's ways, learned his skillsand arts, and also became Christians. Their villagesincluded churches, schools, grist-mills, and blacksmithshops.One elder, Sequoyah, invented an alphabet and awritten language for his tribe in 1820. This wasunique, as the Cherokee Nations were the only Indianculture to develop an alphabet. This inventionresulted in a published bilingual newspaper in 1828.However, the whites coveted the rich Cherokeelands in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, NorthCarolina, and South Carolina. Therefore, the whitessought the United States government to remove the fivecivilized tribes--Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek,and Seminole--to lands west of the Mississippi River(Gilcrease, 1979). This group had the backing of Herbal22 President Andrew Jackson, who felt Native Americanswere deficient in intelligence, possessed no moralhabits, and lacked the desire to improve their lives(Capps, 1973).In 1838, President Jackson issued an order to havethe five Civilized Tribes moved to a Western territorythat is now Oklahoma. Sixty thousand Native Americanswere rounded up at gunpoint, herded into camps, andmoved west under military guard. The greatest numberof people to be transplanted to Oklahoma were theCherokees.Some of the Cherokees escaped, but at theend of the forced march, only fourteen thousand of themsurvived.This forced march has been known as the\"Trail of Tears\" (Capps, 1973).Those who escaped established residency inCherokee Village, North Carolina. After the forcedmarch, the Cherokees rallied, rebuilt their society,and restored a three-part government: executivebranch, legislative branch, and a judicial branchconsisting of a five man supreme court. In 1839, theydrafted a new constitution and by 1840 had implementedit at Tahlequah, Oklahoma. In addition, theyestablished a public school system (Eighteen schools 34 Herbal23 were operating in 1843), published and printed anewspaper The Cherokee Advocate, and established twoseminaries for higher learning (Capps, 1973).The Cherokees were suppressed, discriminatedagainst, and punished, yet they considered all men tobe brothers.After many hardships, they masteredreservation life and in 1906 accepted United Statescitizenship.The following year, the Cherokees helpedorganize the state of Oklahoma (Capps, 1973). 35 CHAPTER IIPLANT IDENTIFICATION, HISTORY, CHEROKEE USES,DAY FAMILY USES AND MEDICAL RESEARCH 36 Herbal25 Chapter IIPLANT IDENTIFICATION, HISTORY, CHEROKEE USES,DAY FAMILY USES AND MEDICAL RESEARCH Twenty-five plants, found in Southwestern Indianahave been chosen to be discussed in this chapter.Under identification of plants, the common name,botanical, scientific, and sometimes family names havebeen given; descriptions of plants and where they werelocated or found have also been included.The history of the plant has been given toidentify the way plants were used in the past, and howthe herbs were recorded in earlier times. Includedwere several folk remedies that were_used by theAmerican Indians (Cherokee), the early settlers, andthe people of Indiana (Hoosiers) as well as the usageof herbs by early medical practitioners.Under Cherokee and Day Family uses, herbs andplants have been discussed and listed according totheir medicinal uses or remedies. The ways plants wereharvested, gathered, conserved, prepared, stored, andwhat parts of plants were used for treatment of the 37 Herbal26different ailments and diseases have been included inthis paper.The purpose of this paper has been torecord Cherokee herbal remedies that were used by theDay Family so the reader might appreciate, identify,and be knowledgeable about the traditional uses ofCherokee herbal cures. Day Family remedies differedsomewhat from the original Cherokee uses.Someremedies that were handed down by word of mouth werenot recorded, were altered, and some parts ignored withthe passage of time.Medical research has been included with regard tospecific chemical components, experiments and studiesof mainly laboratory animals, and what new studies havebeen conducted during the present time.Warnings,cautions, and safety information concerning use ofherbs have also been included. Certain uses ofdrinking, eating, or applying these herbs were found insome cases to be harmful and to cause severe medicalproblems.Sources consulted have been added for the reader'sbenefit to indicate what usage of plants during thepresent time were practiced throughout the Cherokee 38 Herbal27 Nations.Additional information or continued in-depthstudy of plant identification, history, the Cherokeeuses, and medical research of the different plants andherbal remedies were noted.A word of caution: This manual has been writtento record the Day family Cherokee herbal remedies, notto be used as a medical guide. As previously stated,many plants have been found to be very poisonous andpeople have needed to be knowledgeable aboutidentification and selection of each plant beforeattempting to use it in any way. The author found itwise to follow Grandfather Days old adage when lookingand observing the different plants; Squawroot has beenfound in rich, fertile woods. It was a leafy perennialthat reached nine feet (Castleman, 1991).The rootswere knotty and black, the stems smooth, and the leaveswere large, three-divided, and sharply toothed. Theslender, candle-like flowers were white, long-spiked,and emitted an unpleasant odor. The cluster offlowers, up to three feet in length, were foundblooming during the summer from May through September.Black Cohosh grew in rich, open woods and along edgesof fields (Millspaugh, 1892). They have grown profuselyin the Ohio River Valley near and within Harmonie StatePark.History:Black Cohosh, often called Squawroot because ofits use for ailments\", has also been known bythe common name Bugwort, since it emitted an unpleasantodor that repelled insects. It was listed as an 42 Herbal30 official drug in US Pharmacopoeia from 1820 to 1936 asa sedative, a medication for rheumatism, and as apromoter of menstruation (Vogel, 1970). During the1800's and early 1900's, used a Black Cohoshconcoction for fever, rashes, yellow-fever, andmenstrual complaints (Foster and Duke, 1990). InGermany, Black Cohosh has been used in several drugsthat were prescribed for the discomforts of menopause.Another herb called Blue Cohosh was not related toBlack Cohosh; it was of a different botanical family.The Cherokees used both for menstrual problems(Castleman, 1991).Cherokee Uses:The Cherokees boiled the Black Cohosh roots inwater, prepared a tea, and drank the tea forbronchitis, rheumatism, snakebite, colic, sore throat,fevers, nervous disorders, and menstrual irregularities(Vogel, 1970). It was also drunk for consumption,constipation, fatigue, and backache (Hamel andChiltoskey, 1975). Sincb it was used to treat \"women'sproblems\" (delayed menstruation, profuse bleeding,cramps, and pain), it was also called Squawroot 43 Herbal31 (Weiner, 1972). They collected the roots in Septemberor early fall after the fruits had ripened. The rootswere cut lengthwise and allowed to dry then stored forfuture use.Day Family Remedies:Grandmother Day prepared a root tea that was drunkto ward off \"cricks\" in the back and to relieve thepain of rheumatism. Since Comfrey tea and Sassafrastea had been drunk as spring tonics, the Black Cohoshtea was drunk as a tonic to prepare the body for harshwinters.Often Grandmother served the roots as avegetable.They were eaten raw or boiled. They had asweet nutty flavor when they were eaten raw, but whencooked, they tasted similar to carrots.Medical Research:Medical research has indicated Black Cohosh wasanti-inflammatory, that it reduced high blood pressureby opening blood vessels in animal limbs, reducedanimal blood sugar levels, and strengthened femalereproductive organs in rats (Foster and Duke, 1990).The chemical, causlosaponia (similar to pitocin) wasfound to start strong uterine contractions because of 44 Herbal32 properties that acted as estrogen-like components.Itsside effects included dizziness, nausea, vomiting,headaches, joint pains, and depressed heart rates(Costello, 1950).Sources Consulted:Black Cohosh, according to Bell (1993), has beenused by the Eastern Cherokees as a decoction for highblood pressure, headache, painful menstruation, laborpain, and as a tonic. It was common on upland woods atlow elevations and was often found near old homesites.The author purchased an ounce for medicinal purposes. 45 BLOODROOT 46BEST COPY AVAILABLE Herbal34 Bloodroot or Puccoon(Sanquinaria canadensis)Plant Identification:Bloodroot, a perennial, grew in height to twelveinches and was found in large colonies, on woodedslopes, and in rich open woodlands or on bottom landsalong shaded streams (Wampler, 1988). The stems androots had blood red juice but when dried, turned yellowlike Goldenseal, and it tasted just as bitter. A singlewaxy, creamy white flower on a long, smooth stem, witheight to ten petals each had begun to bloom before theleaves appeared. The heart-shaped green leaves wereseven to nine-lobed with network of veins. The undersurface of the leaves were whitish in color(Millspaugh, 1892). This was in early spring from Marchto June.Its genus name, Sanguinaria, meant bloody,and it belonged to the poppy family (Foster and Duke,1990).Colonies were found in Pike County State Forestand the Jim O'Leary Woods; however, it was commonthroughout Southwestern Indiana. Herbal35 History:Bloodroot was listed in the US Pharmacopoeia from1820 to 1926 as a laxative and pain killer and theNational Formulary from 1926 to 1965 (Vogel, 1970).However, it was considered poisonous for animals andpeople.Tyler (1985) stated that people in Indianaboiled Bloodroot in water to make a strong tea solutionfor stomach ailments or colic, but he warned it was tootoxic for human consumption and was not to be takeninternally.Commercial toothpastes, rinses, andmouthwashes have used minute amounts in thepreparations to fight plaque.Cherokee Uses:The Cherokees used Bloodroot tea for rheumatismremedies, to induce vomiting, and to cure sore throats.They also used it for asthma, bronchitis, and even as alove charm.Root juice was squeezed on maple sugar andheld in the mouth. A poultice made from the roots wasused on warts, ringworm, fungus infections, eczema,skin cancers and burns (Hamel and Chiltoskey, 1975). Adye made from the root's red juice sap and mixed withtannin (helped set color and made dye more permanent) Herbal36 from oak bark was used to dye their faces, skin,clothing, baskets, and equipment. Besides being usedas a dye, the Bloodroot juice repelled insects and wasused as an insecticide. The Native Americans collectedthe roots in the fall when the seeds were ripe andafter the leaves had withered, dried them, and storedthem in a dry place (Weiner, 1972). Some tribesbelieved when a warrior desired a certain woman tomarry, he placed Bloodroot in his hands, shook handswith her, and they were married within five to six days(Foster and Duke, 1990).pay_Eamily Remedies:The Day family crushed the Bloodroot, prepared apoultice, or mixed pulverized Bloodroots with lard andplaced this mixture on \"summer\" sores(Infatigo).Bloodroot pulled the poison from action. Achemical, alkaloid sanguinarine, contained alkaloidssimilar to morphine and was found to be an antiseptic,anesthetic, and anticancerous drug in laboratory animal Herbal37 experiments.When roots were eaten, they werepoisonous and very alkaloid. Side effects includeddizziness, vomiting, and gastrointestinal problems(Castleman, 1991). Commercial toothpastes, rinses, andmouthwashes used minute amounts in toothpastepreparations to fight plaque (Tyler, 1985).Sources Consulted:Bell (1993) related that Bloodroot was frequentlyfound at low elevations. It still had uses duringspecial ceremonies as skin coloring and as a dye forbasket decorations. Walkingstick (1993) indicatedBloodroot was mixed with ground hog fat instead of bearfat as a base for salve or poultice. Injections ofstrong tea has been used for hemorrhoids and theCherokees have prepared a Bloodroot poultice frompowdered roots, resin, leaves, and seeds that fungus, ringworm and Common Thoroughwort, was along-lived, hardy perennial and hairy plant; it wasircluded in the daisy, dandelion, and marigold family(Castleman, 1991). It was grown in clumps three tofour feet tall. The leaves were opposite one another,and united at the base. The dull, white, dense, andflat-topped flowers have appeared from July toSeptember or October and have been found in wet, marshyplaces near streams but sunlight areas (Millspaugh,1892). Pike County State Forest was the area in whichBoneset was located.History:Since the stem of Boneset looked as if it werebroken by leaves, the Doctrine of Signatures was theidea applied when Boneset was used as a remedy forbroken bones.Millspaugh (1887) wrote that no plantwas used more extensively or frequently than Boneset.It was listed in fifty-nine indigenous remedies.Thesettlers used the herb dengue Herbal40 \"breakbone fever.\" This mosquito-borne virus causedmuscle pains so severe the victims thought their boneswere breaking. Hence, another reason for the nameBoneset. The settlers sometimes referred to Boneset asIndian sage. They hung bunches of the dried herb, topsdown, in attics and woodsheds so it could be usedimmediately when needed (Vogel, 1970). Tyler (1985)listed Hoosiers as using Boneset remedies for cold,flu, headaches, and malaria fever. It was also placedon sprains to speed healing. From 1820 through 1916,Boneset was listed in US Pharmacopoeia and in theNational Formulary from 1926 through 1950 for fevers,colds, and the flu (Vogel, 1970).Cherokee Uses:The Cherokees wrapped Boneset leaves around brokenbones to aid in healing, poulticed it onto tumors, anddrank it in a tea to relieve pain, fever, colds, flu,and constipation. When used in large doses, it becamea laxative (Weiner, 1972). They also used Boneset forswellings, for sore eyes, to induce vomiting, as apurgative, and as an antiseptic (Hamel and Chiltoskey,1975). For treatment of epilepsy, other tribes boiled Herbal41 the Boneset roots to form steam and then immersed theepileptic victim in the rising steam (Millspaugh,1892). The leaves were collected in late summer(usually August) or early fall when the plant was infull bloom.The leaves were stripped from the stem,dried without exposure to the sun, and then stored in adry, cool place (Olds, 1975).Day Family Remedies:Boiled Boneset root tea was drunk by the Dayfamily as a laxative. Sometimes fresh leaves werechewed for relief of constipation. Often, however, itcaused vomiting and stomach problems. Grandmother usedBoneset only for extreme cases of bowel problems.Medical Research:Medical research indicated Boneset containedimmune-system stimulating properties, and it was foundto depress the motor nerves of the spinal cord(Vollmar, 1986). One of the chemicals derived fromBoneset, called tremeral, caused nausea, vomiting, anddiarrhea when taken in large doses (Castleman, 1991).Millspaugh (1892) noted another chemical, Eupatorin,first caused irritation of motor system but then Herbal42 relaxed the capillaries and increased the heart action.However, drying the herb eliminated the toxicity.Liources Consulted:According to Stone (1991), the Cherokees havecontinued to use Boneset tea for pneumonia, colds, andflu-like symptoms. During the wintertime, steeped teahad been prepared from previously dried leaves andstems; however, during the summer months, fresh leavesand stems have been used for the Boneset tea. Bonesetor Thoroughwort was found occasionally at low to middleelevations in the Smoky Mountains according to Defoe,Langdon, and Rock (1989). Mr. Walkingstick (1993)proclaimed Boneset tea as an excellent medicine forbringing down fevers due to colds or flu. .....,., ,\".\"..,;,.?,-v. t I weed, Burdock, was usedthroughout the world as food. It grew to a height ofthree to five feet. Two species were noted: Great(lappa) Burdock and Common (minus) Burdock. The minuswas most often found during July through October inmoist abandoned fields and waste areas that werereadily exposed to the sun (Weiner, 1972). The rootshad white, spongy, fibrous interiors that became hardas they dried. At the end of the long stems werelarge, hairy, egg-shaped leaves. These leaves weregreen and smooth above, whitish beneath, with tinycrimson veins (Millspaugh, 1892). Each stem was toppedwith many bristled, purplish flowers that producedburrs. Burdock has been found in many areas throughoutSouthwestern Indiana.Historv:Burdock was an European treatment for rheumatism.The leaves, during the fourteenth century, were madeinto wine and used to treat leprosy. Physicians during Herbal45 the 1800's treated urinary tract infections, kidneyproblems, painful urination, skin infections, andarthritis with Burdock (Castleman, 1991). The settlersused dried roots in soups, the leaves as greens, andthe peeled roots like radishes. Tyler (1985) statedHoosiers used Burdock and onion soup for rheumatism andBloodroot tea to thin the blood. They made a poulticefrom crushed Burdock leaves to draw poison from boilsand carbuncles; pulverized Burdock seeds in waterto cause sweating. Burdock root tea was apPlied to theskin to cure acne. The tea contained the carbohydrate,inulin, that formed a protective absorbent layer on theskin.He also believed the fresh root may have hadsome bacteriostatic effect. It was listed in the USPharmacopoeia from 1831 to 1842 and in the NationalFormulary from 1916 to 1947 as a diuretic (Vogel,1970).As an edible plant, Forey and Fitzsimons (1989)stated that the Burdock stalks have been peeled, eatenraw, or boiled like celery. The roots have been usedto make beer, and the leaves have been used in salads. Herbal46 Cherokee:The Cherokees used Common Burdock extensively.Crushed leaves were applied on boils to draw thepoison.They poulticed the crushed seeds for bruises,hives, eczema, and other skin problems (Foster andDuke, 1990). It was also used for rheumatism,hemorrhoids, swellings, and skin disorders. Root orseed tea was drunk to cleanse blood, to prevent scurvyand give weakly females strength (Hamel and Chiltoskey,1975).The leaves and seeds were collected from Julythrough October, usually before a frost, dried, thencrushed, and finally stored in a dry place (Millspaugh,1892). The roots were harvested during fall of firstyear growth or spring of second year. They were driedby exposing to sunlight or in partial shade (Olds,1975).Dav Family Remedies:The Day family has used fresh, crushed leaves onsores, cuts, or bruises. The family has also mixed thefresh leaves with salad greens. Only young and tenderleaves were picked. Aged and mature leaves tastedbitter, toxic, and sour. Herbal48 Medical Research:When tested, the chemical arctigenin inhibitedtumor growth and stimulated uterine activity onlaboratory animals (Castleman, 1991). Side effectsincluded hallucinations, stomach upsets, and diarrhea.Leaf hairs irritated the skin in some test situations(Bryson, 1978).Sources Consulted:According to Hutchens (1992), the Cherokees havebeen known to use the parsniplike Burdock roots as aboiled vegetable. They also have used the young,tender, and fresh leaves as salad greens. Many skinconditions such as blemishes, pimples, and whiteheadshave been treated with a Burdock facial steam bath. Ithas also been poulticed on boils. Burdock was commonlyfound at elevations in the Smokey Mountains. Herbal50 Catnip(Nepeta cataria)Plant Identification:Included in the beenknown as Catmints or Catswort because of itsintoxicating effect on cats (Castleman, 1990). A gray-green, aromatic, perennial, it grew to a height of twoor three feet and has been found in well-drained, humussoil under full sun or partial shade at Lincoln StatePark.The two-lipped, white (sometimes purple-dotted),clustered flowers bloomed from June to September. Thestems were square and the leaves were heart-shaped,scalloped, strongly toothed, and fuzzy (Foster andDuke, 1990).History:Throughout history, Catnip has been used as atranquilizer, a sedative, a digestive aid, a painkiller, and as a mean of relieving menstrual cramps.The colonists introduced Catnip, which grew wild, andquickly spread throughout the country (Millspaugh,1892).The settlers prepared a tea from the leaves tobe drunk for pneumonia, colds, fevers, headaches, 62. Herbal51 irregular menstruation, insomnia, chicken pox, and as atonic.Catnip was listed in US Pharmacopoeia from 1916to 1950 as being able to induce sweating, to promotesuppressed menstruation, and to cure colds. It wasofficially listed in the National Formulary from 1916to 1950 as a stimulant and tonic (Vogel, 1970). Tyler(1985) indicated Catnip tea had been used more often byHoosiers than any other remedy or herbal preparation;they used it as a poultice for headaches and minorburns, as tea for colds and fussy babies, and as asedative for adults.Cherokee Uses:The Cherokees prepared a tea from dried leaves topromote digestion, to sooth infants with colic, torelieve menstrual cramps, and to calm the nerves(Weiner, 1972). The loaves were chewed to relievetoothaches, and dried leaves were placed in a smallbag, hung around a child's neck, so that the childinhaled the healing, soothing vapors. In 1975, Hameland Hiltoskey noted catnip was poulticed on swellings,hives, and boils, and leaf tea was used as a stimulantor tonic. The Native Americans harvested the leaves in 63 Herbal52 late summer, when the plants were in full bloom, driedthem in the shade to preserve the green color, and thenstored them in a dry place. Finally, they bruised orpinched the leaves to release the aromatic oils(Castleman, 1991).Dav Family Remedies:From dried leaves, an infusion of Catnip leaf teawas prepared by Great-grandmother and Grandmother Day.It was drunk before retiring and was used to calm thenerves and to promote sleep.Medical Research:Medical research has found that Catnip haspossessed a chemical, nepetalactone, which was a mildsedative, and was similar to the natural sedative,valepotriate (Jackson, 1969). It had antibiotic,herbicidal, and insect-repellant properties. Sideeffects included upset stomachs for some people(Poundstone, 1969).Sources Consulted:Stone (1991) related many present day Cherokeeuses for Catnip. It has been used as a remedy fortoothaches, for intestinal cramping, baby's colic, and Herbal53 gas pains.Also, the juice from the leaves was used tostimlate menstrual flow. Catnip had been used as asteam inhalant to relieve congestion. Crushed driedleaves were placed in boiling water; a person breathedin the vapors from the steam for several minutes. Thiswas repeated a few times a day. In the Smoky MountainsCatnip was scarce; however, it was found in severallocales or scattered in small populations according toDefoe, Langdon, and Rock (1989). Herbal55 Comfrey(Symphytum officinale)Plant perennial, often Bruisewort, Comfrey has been included inthe forget-me-not family. The large, hairy, lance-shaped leaves were found clasping hollow, woody, andbristly stems. The roots were thick, deep, andspreading.The flowers which bloomed from May throughJune were white, blue, or purple and bell-shaped(Castleman, 1991). The plants were found growing inclay or sandy humus soil and in open woods in HarrisonCrawford State Forest. They often looked like thefirst year rosettes of foxglove but should not beconfused with this plant.History:The Greeks used an extract from Comfrey roots toheal wounds;the Romans boiled it in water andprepared a sticky paste that hardened like plaster.The paste was wrapped around broken bones of the Romansoldiers following battles. The settlers drank a leaftea for respiratory and gastrointestinal ailments 67 77-1'77C77'7777;777477753PF Herbal56 (Castleman, 1991). Tyler (1985) related Comfrey wasmixed with other herbs to produce a herbal mixture forcolds, flu, and for use as a tonic. Herbal tea, madefrom the leaves, provided great relief for stomachproblems, but he recommended Comfrey be used externallyfor research had shown it caused cancer of the liver insmall animals. Leaves, too, were chopped, blended, andapplied as a poultice directly to wounds, or wrapped ina bandage around the wound. The juice was saved tomoisten the bandages when they dried out. The sametreatment was used for boils.Cherokee Uses:The Cherokees drank Comfrey root tea for \"badmemory,\" cancer, genital infections, milky urine, andinternal bleeding. Fresh leaves were poulticed forspraimi, tendinitis, bruises, and pulled muscles(Foster and Duke, 1990). The dried leaves were usedlike tobacco and smoked. They harvested the leavesduring May through June when flowers had begun to bud.Leaves were highest in toxic alkaloids during thistime.The roots were gathered in autumn, cut intoslices, and dried (Olds, 1975). The dried roots were Herbal57 crushed, powdered, and placed on cuts, burns, andwounds to promote healing.Day Family Remedies:Comfrey tea and another common root, Sassafrastea, were drunk by the Day family as spring tonics.The Grandparents also mixed a small amount of bakingsoda in a cup of hot comfrey tea for \"settling an upsetstomach\".Medical Research:Comfrey contained the chemical, allantoin, thatpromoted new cell growth; the roots had more allantointhan the leaves. Research data showed liver damage inlaboratory animals and other articles indicatedComfrey, taken internally, may have caused cancer(Hiron, 1979). It was recommended for external use.Comfrey, when eaten .fresh, contained vitamin C and E;however, it was not to be used in large amounts(Castleman, 1991).Sources Consulted:Mr. Walkingstick (1993) stated a syrup made byboiling Comfrey roots has been long accepted as amedicine of great value for coughs and problems of the 62 Herbal58 lungs.It has also been used for the purpose ofcleansing the body of impurities and for use as atonic.A poultice of fresh or powdered Comfrey driedleaves has helped fresh wounds, swellings, burns,and bruises.Defoe, Langdon, Rock (1989) indicatedComfrey was found occasionally and was welldistributed, but nowhere abundant in the SmokyMountains. 70 'T. ...V:011 Herbal60 Dandelion(Taraxacum officinal)Plant Identification:Dandelion, a perennial plant, was included in thedaisy and marigold families. Yellow, several petaledflowers, which opened each morning and closed by earlyevening, were found blooming, usually in early springbut sometimes as late as August or September (Wampler,1988).Flowering, elongated, hollow stems had milkyjuice, grew rapidly, and produced fluffy seeds thatblew away with the wind. The leaves were jagged-cut,green, and long. Fields, lawns, and waste areas wereplaces where the plants were found (Foster and D',1ke,1990).The Dandelion has been common throughout allSouthwestern Indiana.History:The Dandelion did not originate in the UnitedStates;it was introduced from Europe. The NativeAmericans soon used all parts for food and medicine.Throughout history, all parts have served as food insalads, soups, and stews (Millspaugh, 1892).Medicinally, it dated back thousands of years. The 72 Herbal61 Chinese used Dandelion tea as a cold remedy, and theArabs noted it increased urine production (Castleman,1991).The settlers prepared the leaves by boiling,and chilling, then they ate them as greens. They alsodried the roots, roasted them, then boiled them inwater.This concoction was drunk as a beverage orsubstituted for coffee and tea. Dandelion tea wastraditionally used as a diuretic for liver, gallbladder, and liver problems. It was included in the USPharmacopoeia from 1831 to 1926 as a diuretic and inthe National Formulary in 1888 as a tonic (Vogel,1970).Tyler (1985) listed the following uses for theDandelion:as greens for blood thinner, purifier, andtonic.It was also used to aid digestion, to relievestomachs, and drunk as a wine to promote thedevelopment of measles rash and to lessen the severityof the disease. Forey and Fitzsimons (1989) wrote:roots have been used as a vegetable when peeled,boiled, and served with butter.Cherokee Uses:The Dandelion was linked to the Doctrine ofSignatures because the yellow flowers resembled yellow 73 Herbal62 bile; therefore, it was consi-\u00b0__red a liver remedy bythe Native Americans (Castleman, 1991). For medicinalproperties, the Cherokees prepared a root tea that wasdrunk for heartburn, indigestion and used as a bodytonic.The tea was also drunk as a beverage (Weiner,1972).Roots were dug in the fall, washed, and driedwhole or cut into small pieces, three to six incheslong, and then stored in a cool dry place (Olds, 1975).Sometimes the roots were roasted slowly for severalhours and ground when they became crisp and browninside.All fresh Dandelion parts were used as a food,a beverage, or as a tonic.Day Family Remedies:Grandfather's Dandelion wine, made from theblossoms, was known far and wide. The leaves were usedfor salad and salad \"greens\". Grandmother alsoprepared the stems and blossoms by dipping them into abatter of milk, eggs, and flour, and then frying themin hot grease. The taste was similar to that of manyfried vegetables, such as breaded mushrooms. TheDandelion wine was supposed to have cured many Herbal63 ailments.Even if it did not cure, participants werenot aware of any feeling after drinking this beverage.Medical Research:Research found the Dandelion chemical,Taxaxacerin, had antibiotic action and animal studiesindicated diuretic properties that alleviatedmenstruation bloating, and reduced high blood pressure(Steiner, 1986). Dandelion roots and leaves were avaluable sources of vitamins; they contained morevitamin A than a carrot. They were also high in fibercontent which acted as a cancer preventive in theintestine and colon. For some people, however, itcaused skin rashes. Milispaugh (1892) noted itsometimes caused (1991) related that present-day Cherokeeshave used Dandelion as greens in salads, blossoms havebeen made into wine, and dried roots have been groundinto a \"coffee-like\" beverage. In the spriag a tonichad been brewed from the roots, this was also used as adiuretic, as a laxative, and for many types of 75BEST COPY AVAILABLE Herbal64 digestive problems. This Dandelion leaf tonic usedfresh or dried leaves in one cup of boiling water. TheCherokees drank this tea to aid digestion and calmdigestive disorders. They also had used it to relievecramps, gas pains, control di(rrhea, an relieveconstipation.Even a herbal hair rinse has been madefrom:dried dandelion flowers, two cups of water, andthe juice of a lemon. Certainly, the common \"weedy\"dandelion has had many varied uses. Dandelions werecommon and very dominant in the Smoky Mountains. Theywere found growing in a wide range of elevations. TheEastern Cherokees have continued to use the plant asdid the Western Cherokee Nation. 76 Herbal66 Garlic(Allium sativum)Plant Identification:The perennial Garlic grew to three feet. Thelong, pointed, dark green leaves extended to the middleof the stem.Six-pointed, lavender flowers were mixedwith bulblets that had long, stringed tails (Wampler,1988).They grew well in all types of soil but havebeen found more in direct sunlight areas such as openfields.Garlics have a very strong, pungent odor andhave been found in all areas of Southwestern Indiana.It is hardy and a common plant.History:Garlic has been considered the world's secondoldest medicine, after ephedra. It belonged to theonion family, the name, allium, was derived from theCeltic word which meant pungent. Because it was sopungent or strong, it was considered to have greatpowers.History recorded its use by the ancientsGreeks: Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Theophrastus.

During the 1800's, settlersprepared Garlic in a tea for treatment of colds,bronchitis, coughs, and high blood pressure, in apoultice for croup and pneumonia, and roasted forchildren's croup (Vogel, 1970). A salve made fromGarlic was used to treat infected wounds of soldiers inWorld War I.Tyler (1985) stated that Hoosiers haveused Garlic as an universal home remedy for coughs,high blood pressure, and as a tonic. It has also beenused for intestinal ailments and as a sleep promoter.It was officially listed in the US Pharmacopoeia from1820 to 1905 and the National Formulary from 1916 and as a tonic and diuretic (Vogel, 1970).Cherokee UftsiThe Cherokees used Garlic daily or frequently.Insect sting pain was relieved by placing crushed bulbson the swollen area. Garlic onions and Wild Leeks tea(which had similar properties to Garlic) were used by BEST COPY AVAILABLE Herbal68 the Cherokees to lower blood pressure, decrease woundswellings, and inhibit cancer cells. The fresh bulbsand young green shoots were eaten raw to help controlcolds, diabetes, or stomach problems. Dried bulbs werecooked in other foods for flavor: all parts of Garlicwere used either as food, flavor, or for medicalproperties (Weiner, 1972). Hamel and Chiltoskey (1975)indicated several additional uses, as a stimulant, adiuretic, and a mild cathartic. It was used to preventscurvy and dropsy, to remove deafness, and to preventworms in children, as well as (placed on the chest) totreat croup.They harvested the bulbs in June or July,when the tops had begun to turn yellow. The plantswere cleaned, the outer loose areas were removed, andthe roots were trimmed close to the base. The bulbswere stored loosely or dried in bunches which were hungin a cool, dark area (Olds, 1975).Dav Family Remedies:Grandfather gathered several bulbs and stored themin the \"curing\" shed. He used them to help flavor andcure meats.Grandmother used fresh and dried garlicwhen she prepared many vegetable dishes. She also Herbal69 placed the crushed, dried bulbs that were wrapped in anold woolen sock along with Vick's salve on a person'schest to relieve chest colds or lung congestion. Mgedig.41_1321gArShLThere have been many studies, experiments, andmuch research done on Garlic. One laboratory studyrevealed that it lowered blood pressure, reduced serumcholesterol, acted as a natural diuretic, and showedantibacterial activity (Steiner, 1986). Garlic has to,be chewed, chopped, bruised, or crushed for thechemicals, ajoene and allun, to be transformedmedicinally into the antibiotic allicin. This processactivated the chemicals into a powerful antibiotic. Indiabetes experiments, blood sugar has been reduced inlaboratory animals. AIDS research has indicated dailydoses have increased immune functions of the body, anddecreased diarrhea (Castleman, 1991). When used as asalve, it has lessened the outbreak of sores, althoughit was not a cure. Other studies have found Garlic hashelped gastrointestinal disorders, soothedhypertension, and decreased cancer cell growth inlaboratory mice (You, 1989). However, breath odor from BEST COPY AVAILABLE81 PRI9f15,-S.0. 4 Herbal70 Garlic has prevented many people from using the herb.Additional research has been needed for other possibleuses.Garlic has also been found to be high in VitaminC content.Sources Consulted;Today, Stone (1991) related that Garlic had manyuses.It has been used by the Cherokees as a remedyfor colds, flus, sore throats, and coughs. A coughsyrup was made from boiling garlic bulbs and water forhalf a day.Garlic has also been used for intestinaldisorders, as a diuretic, for heart problems,snakebites, intestinal wnrms, and as an antiseptic.Even charms of Garlic have been worn by many Cherokeesto ward off evil spirits, to give strength, and tostimulate courage and a fighting spirit to the wearerof the charm.In the Smoky Mountains, according to Defoe,Langdon, Rock (1989) Garlic was not as common in thisarea as in other geographic areas. It was welldistributed but nowhere as abundant and was notedgrowing in low to middle elevations. GOLDENSEAL Herbal72 Goldenseal )Plant Identification:Goldenseal, also known as Golden root or IndianPaint, was a low growing (six to twelve inches) hairyperennial.The Goldenseal family has included theButtercup, the Larkspur, and andDuke, 1990).The veined, lobed-leaves were found onforked branches; one leaf larger than the other. Theygrew after the flowers had bloomed and became six toeight inches across. The flowers, single, greenish, andwhite, bloomed in the spring from April to May andproduced a single, orange-red berry chat nestled on thetop of the stem leaf (Wampler, 1988). They lackedpetals but had numerous stamens. The plant grew inclusters and was found in good, natural, drainage areasthat had an abundance of leaf mold or decayingvegetable matter (Foster and Duke, 1990). Goldensealhas been difficult to find; in connection with thisstudy, it was found in Pike County State Forest. 84 Herbal73 History:Settlers used Goldenseal as an eyewash, a woundtreatment and as a sore throat aid, as well as tosoothe digeative problems and to help women recoverfrom childbirth. It was included in the USPharmacopoeia from 1831 to 1842 as a stimulant and fordiaphoretic purposes (Vogel, 1970). Tyler (1985)stated Hoosiers used Goldenseal powdered roots forcancer, types of skin conditions, and for sore mouths.The juice of fresh leaves was prepared as a remedy tobe drunk after an epileptic seizure.Cherokee Uses:The Cherokees favored Goldenseal as an insectrepellant or insecticide. When the large rootstock waspounded into bear fat and smeared on their bodies, itacted as an insect repellent. For skin diseases, theroots were boiled in water and the concoction thenapplied to treat skin disorders; it was used bathfor local inflammations (Hamel and Chiltoskey, 1975).Because Goldenseal had a bitter taste, honey was addedto the herbal tea to improve the flavor (Weiner, 1972).This tea was drunk for sore mouths and throats as a 86 Herbal74 diuretic, or used as a sedative, as well as a digestiveaid.A powder was used as a blister for skin problems(Vogel, 1970). The roots were dug and harvested inautumn or late fall after the plant had withered andfrost had killed top growth. The roots were cleaned,dried until brittle in an airy, shady p3ace, poundedinto a powder, and stored in a dry cool place(Castleman, 1991).Day Family Remedies:Grandfather Day prepared a \"treatment or blister\"salve made with Goldenseal, Wintergreen, and turpentinefor when they \"stifled\" or \"bowed\" a tendon.The poultice was applied daily for an entire week.This treatment \"heated\" the leg, which promotedhealing.M2A1Q41_EMAKSALIn research experiments, twoactive chemicals, berberine and hydrastine, the body's immune system, slowed the growth oftumors, ar.d lowered high blood pressure (Castleman,1991).Berberine killed bacteria that caused diarrhea(such as amoebic dysentery) and was effective against 86 Herbal75 cholera bacteria (Cushman, 1979). More medicalresearch has been needed for it to be used in cancerchemotherapy.Commercially grown and harvestedGoldenseal has been used by modern medicine in avariety of prescription as well as over-the-counterpreparations.Sources ConsultegIStone (1991) related that her grandmother usedGoldenzeal for treatment of an infant's thrush mouth.Within 48 holms, the thrush was gone. Even today, fewwildflowers were as important to the Cherokees as wasthe multi-purpose Goldenseal. Remedies were offeredfor inflamed eyes, mouth sores, for stopping bleeding,and for hemorrhaging. Its use as an antiseptic wasalso well known. A tea was prepared for etomach aches,morning sickness, and as a douche for vaginalinflammations.Mr. Bell (1993) noted there were two types ofGoldenseal which grew on the ridges at low elevationsin the Smoky Mountains. The type used on sores wasrare in that area; however, the author was able topurchase an ounce for medicinal purposes. BEST COPY AVAILABLE \";-; Mayapple(Podophyllum peltatum)Plarj,Lisigntij_iggliouMayapple, also known as Indian Apple, or Devil'sApple, was a common perennial that grew twelve toeighteen inches in height. The unpleasant odor flowersbloomed from April through June. A single, waxy, whiteflower drooped from the crotch or under the lobed leaves (Millspaugh,1892).The plants produced yellow, two-inch, ediblefruits and had creeping roots. They were found inclusters growing in rich, humus, moist, hilly areas,woods or fields (Wampler, 1988). The Mayapple has beena common plant found in all areas of SouthwesternIndiana.HilIQKY1Throughout history, the Mayapple was also known asan Indian apple. Settlers used the roots for medicinalremedies and ate the yellow berries for nutritionalvalues (Castleman, 1991). Hoosier remedies indicatedroot tea induced abortion, powdered roots relievedconstipation, and Mayapple fruits, when eaten, helped Herbal78 overcome heat exhaustion. Tyler (1985) indicated thatthe roots were powerful purgatives, not only on thesmooth muscles of the intestinal tract but also on theuterus. The fruits were edible and when the body lostsalts (electrolytes) during profuse sweating or heatexhaustion, the digested fruits restored body salts andsugar.Because of the sugar, the fruits also served asa source of energy and were eaten raw, cooked, or madeinto preserves. It was on the primary list of thefirst US Pharmacopoeia from 1820 to present and theNationa.l a repellents insecticides to ward off peskyinsects.Thflowers had an unpleasant odor.Pulverized and crushed, the dried roots made into teawere used as a cathartic, a laxative, or a purgativesubstance.The Mayapples were also used forgallstones, worms, and dropsy. Another use included apoultice made from crushed leaves for skin disorders.Homel and Chiltoskey (1975) stated that the joints of Herbal79 the roots were poison; the Cherokee used only thoseportions between the joints for boiled tea. Some womenused large doses to commit suicide. The roots wereconsidered poisonous when ingested in large amounts.When mixed with other herbs and animal fats, the salveor ointment was used to treat different types of warts(Weiner, 1972). They ate the ripe fresh fruit, raw orcooked;however, the fruit had to be ripe, or it wasconsidered poisonous. The fruit was gathered when theleaves withered and turned yellow. The Mayappleleaves, joints, and roots were harvested, collected,and dug from April to June, then dried, made intopoultices, salves, or were dried in bunches and stored(Weiner, 1972).Day Family Remedies:Grandfather Day prepared Mayapple insecticide byboiling the entire plant, which was then sprayed on hisgarden vegetables. This prevented beetles, grub worms,and other insects from destroying his crop.Grandmother prepared Mayapple jelly from the pulp offresh, ripe fruit. It tasted similar to \"crab apple\"jelly; a bit tart, but sweet and at the same time sour. 91 Herbal80 Medical Uses:Research has found Mayapple chemical compoundstreated testicular cancer, venereal warts, and small-cell lung cancer (Foster and Duke, 1990). Etoposide, asemisynthetic derivative of Mayapple, was used to treatseveral types of cancer. Side effects have includeddiarrhea and vomiting. It was a very powerfulglandular stimulant and overdoses easily occurred. Itwas recommended that only very small dosages be used(Tyler, 1986). Some natural gardeners crushed theleaves, boiled them in water, and the sprayed themixture on garden plants. This acted as a naturalinsecticide (Olds, 1975).A chart at the museum of the Cherokee Indian inCherokee, NC indicated the following, \"Drugs derivedfrom Mayapple were used to treat many forms of cancer.Some scientists have believed the chemicals extractedfrom Mayapple were our best hope of curing many formsof lung cancer.\"Sources Consulted:Today as stated by Stone (1991) Mayapples havebeen used as a powerful laxative, as a purge for 9I3ESTCOPYAVAILABLE Herbal81 intestinal worms, as a cure for warts, and for thetreatment of liver problems and cancer. The fruit hasbeen eaten for nutritional purposes. The Cherokeesalso continued to use the Mayapple as an insecticide ontheir crops.In the Smoky Mountains and Cherokee, NorthCarolina, Mayapples were common and dominant throughouta wide range of elevations. It has been used not onlyas a food but has continued to be used by the EasternNation as a laxative and to induce vomiting. MILKWEED Herbal83 Common Milkweed(Asclenias svriaca)Plant Identification:Milkweed, sometimes called types: common and four-leaved. Themilky-juiced, latex, and downy perennial has grown fromone to four feet in height.The common type has hadfour to ten-inch, paired, broad, long leaves, which arefour to eight inches in length while the four-leaved-has had a middle set of larger ones (Millspaugh, 1982).A single dusty, pink-purple globe or ball-shapedcluster flower has had five downward pointing petalsand was borne in the upper leaves. The flowers bloomedfrom June to August. Seedpods were rough-surfaced andsplit when ripe; the seeds had tufts of silky hairs(Wampler, 1988). The Milkweed has been founc in moist,rich or sandy ground near woodlands in all southwesternstate parks and forests.History:Early physicians used Milkweed for asthma,rheumatism and cancer. As an edible weed, the settlerscooked its young shoots or sprouts like asparagus, ate Tt) Herbal84 the roots raw or cooked, and used the leaves in salads(Millspaugh, 1892). The milky sap found in the leavesand stems was bitter and contained glycosides.Theyeliminated the bitter taste and glycosides by boilingthe plants in water several times (Wampler, 1988).Tyler (1985) stated that Hoosiers allowed juice ormilky sap to drip into a cut or wound to stop bleeding,treated burns or sunburns with sap diluted with water,and also applied the mixture to infected poison ivyareas, warts, ringworm, and skin blemishes. Milkweedwas the most common and popular remedy for warts andskin problems. The milky latex formed a protectivecoating when it dried on the skin. Milkweed wasofficially listed in the US Pharmacopoeia under thename Asclepias 1820-1905 and and purgative(Vogel, 1970).Cherokee Uses:The Cherokees prepared a root tea that was used asa laxative to relieve constipation, as a diuretic forkidney stones, to promote Sterility, and to inducesweating (Foster and Duke, 1990). It was applied also 96 Herbal85 to skin disorders: warts, moles, ringworm.Hamel andChiltoskey (1975) indicated the fiber of the plant wasalso used for bowstrings. The plants were collectedduring the pre-blooming stage when they were tender andyoung.Roots were dug, at that time, dried in partialsunlight, pounded into a powd3red mixture, and storedin a dry place. Sometimes tea was prepared from awhole, fresh plant (Weiner, 1972).Day Family Remedies:Grandmother prepared fresh Milkweed sap or juicemixed with lard or butter. She used this preparationon burns, other skin irritations, and blemishes. Shealso used it as an edible vegetable. The leaves,stems, and flowers were picked when young, boiled inseveral changes of water, and then simmered untiltender.The treated pods were sometimes used in soup.Medical Research:The sap was toxic and contained cardioactivecompounds.Very few scientific studies regardingeffectiveness of milkweed have been made (Tyler, 1985). Herbal86 Sovrces Conttplted:At the present time, Milkweed has had a variety ofuses according to Stone (1991). A multitude of skinailments, warts, ringworms, and poison ivy have beentreated with the milky white substance or latex thatoozed from the plant when it was cut or sliced. Aconcoction made from the boiled roots has been used totreat bowel problems, kidney disorders, rheumatism, andasthma.A tea made from the powdered dry roots hasbeen used as a sedative. Even the silky down found inthe giant seedpods has been used to stuff beds,pillows, and to make clothing warmer. Sometimes, theyoung shoots were used as a vegetable but had to beboiled in three or four different batches of water toremove the toxic substances. The Cherokees consideredthe Milkweed roots poisonous and did not eat them.Mr. Walkingstick (1993) indicated Milkweed salvewas used on skin sores. Milkweed was not abundant incertain areas of the Smoky Mountains; however, it wasfound occasionally perennial parasite, has been bestknown as the plant under which people kissed atchristmas.There were many different species, but themost common, least damaging type has been found on oaktrees.The tiny roots bored into the host tree,established new plants, and began to grow (Castleman,1991).Leaves appeared first; afterwards, growth wasrapid.Mistletoe was a thick-branched, woody evergreenwith leathery, three-inch oblong leaves. Thetranslucent white berries or fruit contained a singleseed (Foster and Duke, 1990). Because it grew high intrees, Mistletoe has been difficult to collect. It wasfound high in an oak tree in Harmonie State Park. Ithas not been as common as in the past years.Pollutants in the air have taken a toll on thisparasite; also, logging of oak trees has destroyed manyof the host trees. ICBEST COPYAVAILABLE Herbal89 History:During the Middle Ages, the herb was used fordisorders of the spleen, \"falling sickness\" orepilepsy, and for apoplexy or stroke. The settlersused it to treat high blood pressure and cancer. Theherb's association with kissing was due to Norsemythology.The god of peace, Balder, was slain with amistletoe arrow. When the goddess, Queen Frigga,restored him to life, she gave the plant to the goddessof love, thus anyone who passed under it received akiss (Castleman, 1991).Cherokee Uses:The Cherokees found Mistletoe, when taken in largequantities, induced abortion and stimulatedcontractions during childbirth (Weiner, 1972). Becauseof the action on the uterus, and its ability to stopbleeding following parturition (bleeding afterchildbirth), it was used to promote healing afterbirth.Some women used Mistletoe to preventconception.A tea prepared from the leaves was usedfor epilepsy, headaches, and lung ailments (Foster andDuke, 1990).Hamel and Chiltosky (1975) noted that the Herbal90 Cherokees pulverized the entire plant, made a tea, andbathed the head with tea for headaches and high bloodpressure.Mistletoe was collected during the lateautumn or early winter (November or December). Theleaves and young twigs were dried and stored and thefresh berries mashed to make a paste.Day Family Remedies:The Day Family pulverized the entire plant andmade an infusion that was used externally to bathe thebody and for reducing high fevers. During theChristmas season, Grandmother threaded sprigs ofMistletoe berries, red holly berries, and popcorn on astring.They were used as decorations on the Christmastree.Medical Research:The chemical, tyramine, stimulated uterinecontractions in laboratory test; however, to induceabortion, the dosage had to be high or close to fatal.Scientists studied the chemicals in Mistletoe and foundthat they both raised and lowered blood pressure. Thechemicals that reduced blood pressure appeared topredominate (Franz, 1981). Other studies found Herbal91 Mistletoe stimulated the body's immune system, impairedthe growth of test-tube tumor cells, and benefittedtreatment of lung and ovarian cancer (Mack, 1984).Some reports indicated Mistletoe contained toxicchemicals that caused vomiting, muscle spasms, coma,convulsions, and death. Further investigationconcluded that small amounts of the leaves produced noserious poisoning even though several toxic chemicalswere reported (Castleman, 1991). Toxicity includednausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, muscle spasms,or convulsions. Research has been limited because ofthe fear of toxic chemicals; yet, many approved cancerdrugs have been found more toxic than Mistletoe.Sources Consulted;Mr. Walkingstick (1993) indicated Mistletoe waspoisonous and when used the small white berries weremashed, pulverized, and only used externally.Mistletoe was scarce in several locales and was foundscattered in small populations; when found, it was atlow Vine has grown from six tofourteen inches; it has been found near decayed stumps,near oak trees in the Harrison Crawford State Forest,in soil rich in humus and moisture, and in moist woods,especially those abounding in evergreens. Thick,shiny, dark green leaves were rounded or oval, one-halfinch long, with whitish veins. The creamy white orlight pink, funnel-shaped, paired flowers had innerlobes that were hairy (Wampler, 1988). Single, dry,red or scarlet, edible berries developed after theflowers blossomed from April, May, or June. Birds havebeen fond of the berries (Olds, 1975).BiataKYIPartridgeberry was listed in the NationalFormulary from 1926 to 1947 as a tonic, as anastringent, and a diuretic (Weiner, 1972). Settlersused it not only for tonics and astringents but forswellings, hives, sore nipples, and menstrual Herbal94 difficulties (Vogel, 1970). It was found in a valuablediuretic and was used for various forms of uterinedifficulties (Millspaugh, 1892).Cherokee Uses:The Cherokees troubles\":slow childbirth, placenta delivery, stopped posthemorrhage, and the pain of childbirth (Foster andDuke, 1990).An herbal tea was prepared by boiling theleaves.This concoction was drunk by the pregnantwoman preceding the expected date of delivery. The redor scarlet fruits or berries were eaten when ripe andfresh.Sometimes fresh leaves were made into a tea anddrunk for painful menstruation, for dysentery andpiles, and for sore nipples (Hamel and Chiltoskey,1975).Leaves were collected when plants were bloomingin May or June and then dried under partial sunlightwhile others were used while fresh. Often the entirefresh plant was chopped and pounded. The berries werecollected when ripe and eaten while fresh. 106 Herbal95 Day Family Remedies:Great-Grandmother Day prepared Partridgeberry tea,which was drunk for painful menstruation or \"cramps\".Tea was also given to family members with infected,inflamed, or painful bladder problems.Medical Research:No recent scientific studies have been foundconcerning laboratory tests on Partridgeberry. Sinceit was listed in the National Formulary in years past,a more in-depth study has been needed to determine itsmedicinal properties.Sources Consulted:Mr. Bell (1993) indicated Partridgeberry or SquawVine was still used for \"female problems\" and that theberries were eaten as a food when ripe. The author wasable to purchase one ounce for medicinal purposes. Inthe Smoky Mountains, Partridgeberry was common andquite dominant in all locales according to Defoe,Langdon, Rock (1989). It was found growing at low andmiddle elevations. BEST COPY AVAILABLE PENNYROYAL lOo Herbal97 Pennyroyal(Hedeoma pulecrioides)Plant Identification:An annual, Pennyroyal was included and was otherwise known as Tickweed, Fleabane,or Squawmint.It grew to one and one-half feet inheight and had a mint-like, strong odor or fragrance.Small, opposite leaves were found on short, squarestems that grew from fifteen to eighteen inches. Onthe end of the stems grew pale, blue flowers (Fosterand Duke, 1990). Pennyroyal was found growing fromJuly to September in areas with dry, sandy soil, or ongravelly, loose slopes (Wampler, 1988). It has beencommon along the banks of the Wabash River that runsthrough Harmonie State Park.History:The Greeks hung Pennyroyal in sickrooms, where thefragrance, when released, was thought to promotehealing (Castleman, 1991). Physicians during the1800's combined Pennyroyal with brewer's yeast. Thishas induced abortion, sweating, the early stages ofcolds, and promoted delayed menstruation (Weiner, 1 W) Herbal98 1972).The settlers used Pennyroyal to dress wounds,to repel insects, to treat cold, flu, coughs,congestions, and to stimulate menstruation or abortions(Vogel, 1970). It was listed in the US Pharmacopoeiain 1862-1881 as an ointment and was used to keep offgnats, ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes (Millspaugh, 1892).Tyler (1985) mentioned Pennyroyal several times.Hoosiers prepared a tea, that when drunk, caused apregnant woman to \"come around\"; it was also used forcolds, flu, colic, and headaches. When hung in driedbunches, Pennyroyal drove away mosquitoes. Pennyroyalwas officially a decongestant, a cough remedy, adigestive aid, and an abortion inducer. It got itsname, Fleabane, because of its use to repel insects andfleas.Cherokee Uses:The Cherokees crushed the leaves and inhaled themint-like odor to relieve headaches. They alsoprepared a tea to be drunk for relief of menstruationcramps and pain. Other uses included treatment ofdiarrhea, painful urination, and hemorrhaging. Hameland Chiltoskey (1975) wrote that beaten leaves were IL Herbal99 held in the mouth for toothaches, and that crushedleaves were rubbed on the skin as an insect repellent.They collected the leaves in early summer when theplant was in full bloom. The leaves were dried in theshade and then stored in a dry cool place. The freshcrushed leaves were inhaled. Tyler (1985) stated thatmany Native Americans used Pennyroyal tea to treatbites from rabid animals that were no higher than theshoulder.The wounds were packed with bruised, freshleaves or with soaked dry leaves, and if patients couldswallow, tea was given to them. However, if victimscould not drink the tea, they were washed with theliquid.Dav Family Remedies;Grandmother Day boiled or simmered the leaves in asmall iron pot that was left sitting on the back of anold iron kitchen stove. The steam would go throughoutthe home to freshen the air and to relieve headachesduring the wintertime. She sometimes took Pennyroyal,mixed it with other plants (crushed rose leaves, mints,pine needles), placed the herbs between clothes, andsewed them into small squares. Then she placed these Herbal100 fragrances in dresser drawers to keep clothes smellingfresh.Medical Research:Pennyroyal oil was very toxic. Symptoms includedsevere headaches, nausea, weakness, and paralysis oflimbs (Millspaugh, 1892). As little as a teaspoon ofconcentrate caused death. However, when dried, theherb lost its toxicity and was used without danger.Scientists have found chemicals similar to peppermintmenthol but they were not as strong (Sullivan, 1979).Some skin creams mixed Pennyroyal with otheringredients to promote healing. It has been called apowerful but dangerous intestinal irritant which causedabortion and sometimes death when eaten by animals(Vogel, 1970).Sources Consulted:According to Bell (1993), Pennyroyal was nowhereabundant but was well distributed over a wide area inthe Smokey Mountains. It was found occasionally at lowand middle elevations. The Eastern Cherokees inhaledPennyroyal steam for headaches and often crushed thefresh leaves which were then placed on a tooth for BEST COPY AVAILABLE Herbal101 treatment of a toothache. He also mentioned thatPrickly Ash Bark (known as toothache tree) was anexcellent remedy for toothaches. The author was ableto purchase one ounce of medicinalpurposes. Herbal103 Senna(Cassia known as Cassia and included inthe pea family, was a hardy perennial with five petalyellow flowers that was found in loose clustersblooming during the summer. The yellow flowers wereborne on slender, fuzzy stems; the leaves were pointed,and the seeds were in leathery pods (Wampler, 1988). Asmall wood shrub, it grew to three feet in height. Ithas been necessary to avoid confusing it with cinnamon;both came from peelable bark. It was found growing inrich humus soil near woodlands, thickets, andbottomlands in Pike County State Forest.History:History has revealed Senna was widely used inother countries from the Middle East to India to treatfevers (Castleman, 1991). It was listed in MaPharmacopoeia from 1820 to 1882 as a mild laxative(Vogel, 1970). Tyler (1985) stated Senna was a folkremedy;Hoosiers made tea from the leaves that wereused as an excellent purge for the body system. BEST COPY AVAIIABLE Herbal104 Cherokee Uses:The Cherokees pounded the roots of Wild Senna withwater to make a salve or poultice and then applied themixtures to sores or wounds. A tea was good forchildhood illness, for heart troubles, for faintingspells, and for cramps (Hamel and Chiltoskey, 1975).After a decoction was made from the leaves, it wasdrunk to reduce fevers and to ease sore throats. Thedried, powdered leaves were also used for catharticpurposes or as a strong laxative (Weiner, 1972). TheCherokees gathered, prepared, and stored the roots,leaves, and seeds at the time of flowering.Day Family Remedies:Grandmother Day prepared a Wild Senna herbal teaand laced it with brown sugar to improve the taste.

Also, large amounts caused BEST COPY AVAHABLE Herbal105 diarrhea, nausea, cramps, severe Hutchens (1992), made a decoction from dried leaves andhave drunk it to reduce fevers and ease sore throats.They also used Senna tea ae a mouth gargle. Largedoses have been used as an emetic and cathartic. Aremedy for pimples was a paste made of dried leaves andvinegar.Senna was found occasionally at lowelevations in the Smoky Mountains. It was notabundant;however, the author was able to purchase oneounce for medicinal purposes. SKULLCAP Herbal107 Skullcap(Scutellaria lateriflora)Plant Identification:A alsobeen called Mad-dog Skullcap, Quaker Bonnet, or Mad-dogWeed.A slender, branching, two-foot shrubbyperennial, it had a tiny skull-cap growth that gave itits common name (Wampler, 1988). The upper part alsohad short, whitish hairs. Long-stalked, serrated,toothed leaves were opposite one another, pointed atthe tips, and oval or lanced-shaped. The flowers hadtwo lips, were violet or blue, and bloomed in the shade(Foster and Duke, 1990). It grew in rich, moist soil,in wooded thickets and was found in Harmonie State Parkfrom July throvgh August.History:For years the Chinese used Skullcap as atranquilizer or sedative for treatment of convulsionsand as a digestive aid. During the 1800's Skullcap wasused as a sedative, for treatment of malaria fever, andas a nerve tonic (Castleman, 1991). It was listed in Herbal108 the US Pharmacopoeia from 1820 to 1882 where it wasdescribed as a mild laxative (Vogel, 1970).Cherokee Uses:The Cherokees drank Skullcap tea to promotesuppressed menstruation and also to stop diarrhea(Weiner, 1975). Because of its bitter taste, it wasmixed with honey to improve flavor. It was alsoreported to be effective against rabies, hence the nameMad-Dog Skullcap. The Cherokees also mixed bruisedroots moistened with water and bear grease to be usedas a dressing for sores, swellings, inflammations, andother types of wounds (Hamel and Chiltosky, 1975). Theplant was cut in the spring when stems and leaves wereyoung and tender; however, sometimes the leaves wereharvested in midsummer when the plant was in fullbloom.The leaves and stems were dried in full shadeand then stored.Day Family Remedies:Great-Grandfather Day used a Skullcap salve andmixed it with \"hog fat\" to use on horses where theharness rubbed the body sore. The Skullcap healed andthe lard prevented large scabs from forming. It also I c Herbal109 prevented white hairs from growing back where the sorehad occurred.Medical Research:Skullcap contained the chemical compoundscutellarine, that was a sedative and was found to haveantispasmodic qualities (Kimura, 1981). Certainly,with all of its past uses, more research has beenneeded.Millspaugh (1892) stated that Skullcap proveditself useful as a tonic in chlorea, tremors, chronicdisorders, and many other diseases. However, he foundmental confusion, stupor, headache, dilated pupils, andvariable pulse with reduction of heart action followedby wakefulness and restlessness as many of the sideeffects of this plant.Sources Consulted:The National Park Service indicated Skullcap wasquite abundant throughout the Smoky Mountains. It wasfound growing at low to middle elevations.Walkingstick (1993) stated that a strong Skullcap teawas used for insomnia, alcoholism, headaches, and painsin the heart.Sometimes it was administrated for thetreatment of cramps and female problems. It was also BEST COPY AVAIIABLE Herbal110 used as a dressing on sores, swellings, andinflammations. Herbal112 Snakeroot(Polyoala senega)111..Mt.There have been two perennialSnakeroot:Senega and Black Sanicle. The Senega wasthe most common and the most often used. Small, pt,.a-like, oblong, white-spiked leaves were alternated withlance-shaped leaves on smooth stems. The thistle-like,greenish-white flowers were mingled with stiff, pointedbracts (Foster and Duke, 1990). Snakeroot grew to sixto eighteen inches during May through July in rocky,partially shaded, open hardwood forests where there wasleaf mold or similar humus. It has been found in manyareas in Southwestern Indiana.History:In Indiana, Tyler (1985) noted that Hoosiers usedSnakeroot remedies for snakebites, kidney problems, andviolent bleeding. He recommended that white snakeroot(Euvatorium rucrosum) never be used internally; it wasextremely poisonous for humans and animals. People whodrank milk from cattle that had eaten the root acquiredthe condition \"milk sickness,\" which was sometimes 124 Herbal113 fatal.In 1818, Abraham Lincoln's mother, Nancy Hanks,was reported to have died of this disease. (TheLincolns, at that time, resided in Spencer County,Indiana).One type, Button Snakeroot (Ervnaium yuccafolium) was similar to yucca; hence, its botanicalname.Another species, Black Sanicle (Saniculamarilandica) was used by the settlers and Indians forpain, kidney ailments, rheumatism, and fevers. It wasofficially listed in the US Fharmacormeia from 1820-1936 as a cough remedy, stimulant, and inthe National Formulary from apreferred and treated high fevers with thisinfusion.They used a poultice made from the rootsthat was applied on snakebites, reduced swellings ofwounds, and minimized pain (Weiner, 1972). It was usedfor other ailments as well; as a sweat inducer forcolds, coughs, croup, bronchitis, also on joints torelieve piin and for rheumatism. They blew a decoctionof the root upon a patient for fever and feverish 125 Herbal114 headaches (Vogel, 1970). The roots were dug in thespring and again in late fall when the leaves were deadbut before the first frost. They were cut, dried inthe sunshine, and stored in a dry place. Sometimesthey were pounded into a coarsely-powdered substance(Millspaugh, 1892).Dav Family Remedies:The snakeroot andlard, or \"hog fat.\" This mixture was placed on swollenjoints of the farm animals. The family was alwayscautious with the cattle and horses. Snakeroot eatenby cattle and horses killed them or made them severely Medical Research:Snakeroot contained poisonous substances; whentaken in large doses, it was fatal to laboratoryanimals.However, the chemical, methyl salicylate, hasrelieved pain in laboratory experiments (Foster andDuke, 1990).There had been limited scientificresearch due to the toxic chemicals found in differentspecies of the plants. Millspaugh (1892) notedSnakeroot in some cases caused paralysis of muscles of BEST COPY AVAIIABLE126 Herbal115 the respiratory tract and of the motor system,constriction, aching, soreness, restless sleep, andgeneral debility.Sources Consulted:Snakeroot, according to Walkingstick (1993),wasn't as popular as a medicinal remedy at the presenttime;however, the Eastern Cherokees sometimes haveused Snakeroot salve or poultice to reduce swellings ofjoints.The plant was scarce and was scattered insmall populations at low elevations in the SmokyMountains. 127 SP1KENA RD Herbal117 Spikenard(Aralia racemosa)Plant Identification:Spikenard was a perennial, aromatic herb that grewthree to five feet in height, that has been foundblooming in rich woods in the area of SouthwesternIndiana.Its family members have included the Ginsengfamily (Foster and Duke, 1990). Long, smooth, darkgreen or reddish stems had small whitish flowers thatformed small clusters on tiny branches that extendedfrom the stems. The flowers bloomed from June toAugust.The leaves were dark, deep green, saw toothed,and heart-shaped (Millspaugh, 1892).History:Settlers used Spikenard as a blood purifier and asa remedy for lung ailments, asthma, rheumatism, andbackaches.The powdered roots were officially listedin the National Formulary from 1916 to 1965 as astimulant and for diaphoretic purposes (Vogel, 1970).Hoosiers, as reported by Tyler (1985), combinedSpikenard with wild mint and used this as a preparedmassage lotion for sore backs. Another herbal mixture 129 Herbal118 that included Spikenard was taken for tuberculosis.The boiled root was made into a poultice which wasapplied on wounds to treat blood poisoning.Cherokee Uses:The Cherokees prepared a Spikenard root tea forbackaches, menstrual difficulties, coughs, asthma, anddiseases of the lungs; they made the roots into a salveto be used on boils, infections, swellings, wounds, andcuts (Hamel and Chiltoskey, 1975). The beaten andpulverized roots were also used on burns and the rootjuice was used for earaches (Weiner, 1972). Spikenardwas gathered during June through August. The freshroots were pulverized for the juice and made into asalve or poultice. Other harvested, chopped, andpounded roots were dried in an open sunny place, thenpowdered, and finally stored in a dry cool place. Whenneeded, the powdered roots were used in preparing aroot tea.Dav Family Remedies:Grandfather Day used a poultice hoof when \"thrush\" (hoof rot) developed. 130 Herbal119 Thrush was common during the winter months or when ahorse was stalled for a long period of time.Medical Research:Modern research has found Spikenard contained thechemical aralin (Weiner, 1972). This chemical was usedin some over-the-counter drugs and has been found intypes of massage lotions. Some people have allergicreactions that have caused skin rashes, sores, and skineruptions.Millspaugh (1892) reported some sideeffects that included impeding suffocation, profusenight sweat, nausea, and diarrhea.Sources Consulted:Occasionally, the Cherokees, according to Hutchens(1992), have used the dark ripe, purple berries forSpikenard jelly. They also have used the whole root asfood.Spikenard, as a medicinal remedy, has beencombined with other herbs and brewed into a tea. Thistea was drunk to purify the blood. Walkingstick (1993)also indicated Spikenard drops were used extensivelyfor earaches.The National Park Service has foundSpikeuard growing frequently at a wide range of BEST COPY AVAIIABLE13 Herbal120 elevations and has found it well distributed in theSmoky Mountains. 132 ST.MIjOHN'SaiWORT 133 Herbal122 St. Johns Wort(Hypericum perforatum)Plant Identification:St. Johns Wort, a woody, rapidly spreadingperennial belonged to the same family as Rose-of-Sharon.The yellow flowers, five-petaled with blackdots on their margins, were found in bushy clusters andmeasured about one inch across (Foster and Duke, 1990).These were found on numerous slender branches. Oblonganddotted with translucent glands, the leaves whenpinched produced a red oil and emitted an aromareminiscent of turpentine (Wampler, 1988). From Juneto September, it grew one to three feet (sometimes upto five feet) and was found in fields with dry, lightsoils in Pike County State Forest.History:Europeans introduced St. Johns Wort to the UnitedStates, where it grew wild and spread rapidly. Namedin honor of John the Baptist, St. Johns Wort wasbelieved to release its blood-red oil on August 29, thetime of the Saint's beheading. Wort was an old Englishword for plant. Another legend was that the plant, 13 Herbal123 during the days of strong belief in witchcraft, wascollected on St. Johns Night, June 24. It collected ontime, it afforded protection against witches and evilspirits.The Greeks used the herb for burns, as adiuretic, as a menstruation promoter, and for fever.They also burned the leaves to purify the air, driveaway evil spirits, and to ensure healthy crops(Castleman, 1991). It was used as a Doctrine ofSignatures plant because the red-oil was believed goodfor wounds.The settlers used it for colds andbronchitis during the 1800's and the physicians usedthe herb c.or the treatment of wounds. Millspaugh(1892) recorded its use for the nervous system.Cherokee Uses:The Cherokees used St. Johns Wort salve or freshmilky substance for treatment of external ulcers,snakebites, wounds, sores, cuts, bruises, and otherskin problems. They prepared an herbal tea for bladderailments, dysentery, diarrhea, respiratory diseases,bronchitis, and lung infections. The crushed plant wassniffed for nosebleeds and infants were bathed in aroot decoction strength (Hamel and Chiltoskey, BEST COPY AVAILABLE13a Herbal124 1975).Other Native American tribes combined St. JohnsWort with Black Raspberry root in hot water; thisconcoction was used for the treatment of tuberculosis.The leaves were harvested when the plants bloomed, Junethrough August. They were air dried and stored in acool, dry place (Olds, 1975). The fresh blossomingplant was chopped and pounded to a pulp for making asalve (Millspaugh, 1892).Day Family Remedies:Great-Grandmother Day always had St. Johns Wortsalve ready for large cuts and wounds. She ironed oldlinen until nearly brown (scorched) to sterilize it.Then this material was placed over the salve or woundso that it did not become contaminated. Healing wasrapid, and this preparation rarely left any scartissue.Medical Research:The active chemicals that were found in St. JohnsWort choline, pectin, rutin, sitosterol,hypericin, and pseudohypericin. Since 1988, hypericinhas been researched for AIDS treatment as a sedative,anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial drug. Also, it BEST COPY AVAILABLE136 Herbal125 has reduced fever, decreased swelling of lymph nodes,improved appetites, and increased the energy of AIDSpatients (Foster and Duke, 1990). However, it was nota cure.Recent research has indicated immune-stimulating chemicals and anti-bacterial, anti-fungal,and anti-inflammatory activity. In laboratoryexperiments when mice infected with the leukemia viruswere injected with an extract of St. Johns Wort, theydid not develop the disease. When given orally, it wasequally effective. HIV infected mice had similarresults.Side effects included skin burns, rashes, andblistering because of the chemical hypericin (James,1989).Further research was needed for HIV andleukemia treatments of St. Johns Wort.

Yellow Root was found frequently in lowto middle elevations in the Smoky Mountains. 170 Herbal159 CONCLUSION The people of the Cherokee Indian Nation sufferedfrom many illnesses and diseases. They used mostlyplants and spiritual guidance to treat their healthproblems.The early settlers used many of the remediesthat they had learned from the Cherokees, but severalof the remedies were not recorded and had been lost,ignored, forgotten, or altered with the passage oftime.The Cherokee herbal methods of treatment werebased on experiments, trial and error, and reasoning.Some remedies were useless but usually rational andoften effective. An astonishing number of NativeAmerican drugs and treatments have proved to be ofenormous value. The Day family used plants and herbsfor medicinal purposes up to the time of the discoveryof penicillin and other antibiotics. The nearestdoctor and hospital was several miles from their home;therefore, the family depended on the naturalenvironment for medicinal cures. As a child, theauthor remembers seeing dried herbs hanging in variousplaces, crushed or pulverized herbs stored in jars, and 171 Herbal160 other herbs being used daily either as teas, salves, orpoultices.The author has used her grandparents\"cures\" and has found them most effective on animalsand humans.Certain herbs and plants have been adopted by thepharmacopeias and have currently been tested; anexample would be the use of St. Johns Wort fortreatment of AIDS, and Mayapple for small-cell lungcancer.Herbs have become a very important andintegral part of modern medicine. Many over-the-counter drugs of \"modern medicine\" have contained asactive ingredients herbs that have been chemicallysynthesized and mass-produced. Perhaps more use,research, and knowledge of Cherokee natural herbalremedies would replace more of the synthetic compoundsthat have occurred in many prescription drugs. Oftenuse of natural remedies has proved to be safer than useof synthetic ones. Unfortunately, most American plantshave yet to be investigated in terms of pharmacology,chemistry, and medicinal cures. Often studies thathave been several Years old have represented the latestavailable information on herbs. Little has been done 1 7 Herbal161 in such research in the United States. Most of theresearch has been conducted in Germany, Eastern Europe,and Asia.Updated and more current research has beenneeded by American scientists.As of January 6, 1993, the National Institute ofHealth has recognized the importance and the use ofherbal medicine as a form of treatment for certaintypes of illnesses. The institute also encouragedfurther study and research on various plants formedical value.Because of dwindling natural resources, educatorshave had to teach a deeper appreciation of plant usage,encourage a commitment to conservation of these plants,and help people gain a deeper sense of theirrelationship to their environment and to the naturalworld.Hopefully, mankind, including educators, willpromote an interest in the conservation, collection,identification, preservation, and healing properties ofherbs.Old herbal cures and remedies, better treatments,greater appreciation of Cherokee cultural heritage, andknowledge of Cherokee Herbal Remedies will add a new BEST COPYAVAILABLE Herbal162 dimension and appreciation to people's lives. 174 Herbal162 HERBAL REMEDIESFACULTY CURRICULUM HANDBOOKANDLESSON PLANS 175 Herbal163CHEROXEE HERBAL REMEDIESCURRICULUM GUIDE This guide is an accelerated course outlinedesigned for students who are interested in plantidentification, conservation, history, Cherokee uses,and current developments and research of herbalmedicinal uses.
