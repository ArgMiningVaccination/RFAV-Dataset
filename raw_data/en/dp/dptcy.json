The enhancement factor can be as much as 10 7-1015, which allows the technique to be sensitive enough to detect single molecules. The rapid growth of pharmaceutical industries worldwide demands continuous development of efficient characterization techniques to detect the presence of the molecules at extremely low concentrations. SERS allows fast, sensitive detection of trace levels of key pharma molecules. This review highlights the requirements for SERS and its applications for pharmaceutical characterization. Keywords Nanomaterials, Synthesis, SERS, Drugs Introduction Raman spectroscopy is concerned with radiation scatter - ing from a sample. Scattering occurs when an incident photon interacts with the electric dipole of a molecule. This scattering process can be either elastic or inelastic. Most incident photons are elastically scattered by the molecule (Rayleigh scattering). In Rayleigh scattering, the energy of the incident photons equals the energy of the scattered photons. Raman Scattering is a small frac-tion of light that is scattered at energies different than that of the incident photons (Raman Effect). The Raman Effect is an inelastic process and was first observed in 1928. Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman awarded Nobel Prize in 1930. Two situations arise with Raman scatter - ing; (i) Scattered photons have a lower energy (Stokes scattering-phonon emitted), (ii) Scattered photons have a higher energy (anti-Stokes scattering-phonon ab-sorbed), Figure 1.Raman spectroscopy is very useful in drug analysis due to advantages such as ease of use, minimal sample handling, and the significant differences in scattering strength between packaging materials, tablet excipients, and active drug components [1-3]. It can also be used to identify isomers and to determine energy difference between isomers. These advantages, in combination with fiber optics and microscopes, have enabled the use of Raman spectroscopy as a quality control tool in the pharmaceutical industry. One major disadvantage with conventional Raman spectroscopy is the small scatter - ing cross section of many materials. Since its discovery in 1974, Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been fast developing an analytical method for detection of molecules, particularly in mol - ecule sensing and characterization. SERS is an emerg - ing method for studying the vibrational fingerprints of molecules. The observation of greatly enhanced Raman intensities for molecules after adsorption on substrates such as Ag, Au, and Cu, has been an experimentally and theoretically interesting phenomenon [4]. The SERS ef-fect becomes strong if the frequency of the excitation light is in resonance with the main absorption band of the molecule being illuminated. Due to the high inten - sity of the Raman signal, SERS method is a highly useful technique in both surface science and analytical [ 5]. Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) SERS is a form of Raman spectroscopy in which an un - usually high Raman scattering cross-section is achieved when an analyte molecule gets adsorbed to a metallic nano-size surface. SERS involves adsorption of targeted molecules onto the nanosubstrate surfaces. Substrates REVIEW ARTICLE Page 2 of 7 Saleh.

There are several parameters and conditions that are to be optimized to obtain enhanced Raman signal and to ensure maximum signal generation and enhancement. These parameters include the selection of excitation source, the features of the substrate, and the ratio of the sample to the substrate. The electromagnetic en-hancement is strongest where the particles have the highest curvature; thus, the adsorption of the analyte on the long or narrow axis of an ellipsoid or spheroid effects the magnitude enhancement. Information obtained using SERS: SERS is used to investigate the vibrational properties of adsorbed mol - ecules yielding structural information on the molecule and its local interactions. Uniquely identifies molecules. Enables the detection of individual molecules. The role of substrates and mechanisms of enhance - ment There are many forms of SERS substrates depending on the purpose they are used for different applications [6,7]. SERS was first observed on the roughened surface of electrodes [8,9]. The Raman spectrum of pyridine was enhanced to almost more than million times in SERS on metal colloids [10]. This phenomenon was called SERS and it was realized that the nature of the substrate plays an important role in the enhancement [11]. Nano sub - strates from metals such as gold, silver, and copper exhibit enhancement of Raman spectra [12]. Figure 3 shows TEM image of silver nanoparticles. Every materi - al has a characteristic plasmon (collective oscillations of electrons) associated with it, which is size dependent. When the mean free path of the electron exceeds the size of the structure; 10 nm to 100 nm, the plasmon is mostly associated with the surface. When a light match-ing the plasmon frequency of the nanostructure is in - cident on it, it excites the surface plasmon of the na-are of a variety of metals, like silver, gold, or copper with differing morphologies. Generally, gold and silver are most often used as SERS substrates because they are air stable materials. For example, the adsorption of methi-mazole molecules on silver nanoparticles, Figure 2. The coinage metals of Au, Ag, and Cu are usually used since the resonance condition for these metals lies at com-mon laser frequencies for Raman spectroscopy. In addi-tion, at the resonance frequency, the dielectric function for these metals is minor. The simplistic explanation based on the SERS is that the intensity of the Raman scattering is proportional to the induced dipole of the given molecule. The induced dipole is proportional to the polarizability of the molecule and the magnitude of the incident electric field. The main steps proposed in electromagnetic theory containing (i) An analyte is ad-sorbed on a surface patterned or roughened so that the chosen excitation frequency will excite a plasmon and create scattering; (ii) Energy with a proper wavelength of excitation, from the plasmon, is transferred to the adsorbed molecules and the Raman process occurs on the molecule; and (iii) Energy is transferred back to the plasmon less the amount transferred to the nuclei and scattered from the surface as wavelength shifted light. These simple steps are the main steps. Optimization of conditions for SERS The last decade has seen major advances in the ap- plication of SERS and Raman spectroscopy primarily be-cause of made in Raman instrumen - tation. The Raman instrumentation consists of lasers, spectrometers, optics and detectors. Lasers: The laser excitation frequency is the major de - terminant of the information content of a Raman spectral measurement. Both continuous and pulsed lasers are used. Optics and Filters are used to remove the Rayleigh scattered photons. Spectrometers, Detectors: The purpose of the Ra-man spectrometer is to reject the intense Rayleigh scattered light and to disperse the Raman scattered light into its component frequencies for detection. If the Rayleigh light can enter the spectrograph un attenuated, it will obscure all or part of the much weaker Raman spectrum. The most common and still most versatile Raman spectrometers utilize ho - lographic dispersive gratings and CCD multichannel detectors. These spectrometers are useful from the UV to the near-IR spectral region. Photomultipliers were the standard detectors used until recently. CCD (charge coupled detector) are now more commonly used. SERS substrates: commonly used Silver (Ag), gold (Au) and copper (Cu). The energy required to generate plasmons matches 50 nm Figure 3: TEM image of silver nanoparticles used in SERS applications.

Chemical enhancement (CE): It results from an in - crease in molecular polarizability, due to the charge trans - fer between metal and sample molecule and due to specific interactions, forming charge-transfer complex - es. When molecules are adsorbed to the surface, their electronic states can interact with the states in the met - al and produce new transitions which cause enhance- ment of Raman signal. It was proposed by Albrecht and Creighton in 1977. It involves charge transfer between the chemisorbed species and the metal surface. The mag - nitude of chemical enhancement ~10-100 times. SERS enhancement factor SERS enhancement factor can be calculated as Ana- lytical enhancement factor (AEF): / = /SERS Raman nals, CSERS, molecule concentrations for SERS and Raman, respectively. SERS substrate enhancement factor (SSEF): / = /SERS surf RS volINSSEFIN Where Nvol = CRS V - number of molecules in the scat- tering volume V SERS Applications for Pharmaceuticals SERS methods are widely used for obtaining quali - tative and quantitative information of different struc- tures including pharmaceuticals. SERS line-widths are relatively narrow which allows for higher discrimination between samples with similar spectral profiles. Several pharmaceutical molecules show good Raman spectra even in diluted conditions. Commercial drugs are used nosubstrate. This is called surface plasmon resonance [13]. The excited surface plasmon produces an oscillating di - pole leading to the generation of the source, producing a local electromagnetic electromagnetic (EM) radiation matching the excitation enhancement very close to the surface (~1 nm of the nanosubstarte). When a molecule is in the proximity of the surface of such a nanostruc - ture, the Raman signals enhanced due to the increase of the EM field because of resonant plasmons, leading to the phenomenon of SERS [14]. There are two proposed mechanisms for SERS enhancement, electromagnetic enhancement and chemical enhancement [ 15]. Electromagnetic (EM) enhancement: The collective excitation of the electron cloud of a conductor is called a plasmon; if the excitation is confined to the near surface region it is called a surface plasmon. EM enhancement is a consequence of the interaction of incident electric field (from incident radiation) with the electrons on the met - al surface, which causes excitation of surface plasmons and, thus, enhancement of electric field at the metal sur - face. This mechanism was proposed by Jeanmarie and Van Duyne in 1977. Electromagnetic enhancement aris- es from the presence of surface plasmons on the sub - strate, Figure 4. Surface plasmons are electromagnetic waves that propagate along the surface parallel to the metal/dielectric interface. Surface plasmons are generated when the incident light excites the electron gas of the metal. When a substrate is placed in the proximity of the plasmon, it experiences an enhanced electromagnetic field and produces an enhanced scattered Raman field. Excitation of surface plasmon tends to form specially localized \"hot areas\". The magnitude of enhancement ~106-107 times for single colloidal silver, and ~108 for the gap between Incident light Plasmons NanoparticlesSERS Signal Molecule Figure 4: Interaction of laser beam with the molecules on the nanoparticles.

SERS were obtained using a small cu-vette by using a volume ratio of three portions aqueous methimazole solution to one portion of nanoparticles dispersion. The data acquisition time was 20 seconds with one accumulation for collection with each SERS spec - tra. The SERS spectra were obtained in the range from 400-2000 cm -1 as shown in Figure 6. The method was reported with a good coefficient of determination, R2 = 0.998 with a physical detection limit of 10 pM [ 5]. Eliasson and Matousek [18] demonstrated the spectroscopy (SORS) in the iden - tification of counterfeit pharmaceutical tablets and cap-sules through different types of packaging. This meth-in low doses and are formulated in an inert matrix or excipient to make them into a tablet form, or to modify the release rate into the patient's system. Raman map-ping and imaging of samples may provide data about the distribution and relative amounts of active agent, additives, and binders present. An example is depicted in Figure 5 which shows the distribution of ketoconazole in creams samples. The spectrum of the pure pharma-ceutical agent can be obtained by subtracting the ma-trix spectrum from that of the commercial drug. Useful spectrum may sometimes be obtained without subtrac-tion when the pharmaceuticals are strong Raman scat-ters and the fillers are weak Raman scatters [ 15-17]. SERS allows the direct analysis of pharmaceuticals thus make its applications easy in quality control of manufacturing and formulation results in significant time and cost savings.

Conclusions Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) revolu- tionalised the Raman spectroscopy in the last decade. SERS is based on the marked enhancement of Raman signals of certain molecules when they are placed in the proximity of certain nanostructured metallic sur-faces. Two types of mechanisms (Electromagnetic and Chemical Enhancement) are currently used to explain the SERS phenomenon. SERS has advantages of (i) High sensitivity, (ii) Specificity and Valuable tool for analyzing mixtures, (iii) Low-power lasers and low magnification optics are suitable to acquire SERS spectra in very short acquisition times (typical ~10 s), and (iv) Many applica - tions including drug analysis, manufacturing, and qual - ity control.

With high-quality spectra, drugs like promethazine, diclofenac, theophylline, and indomethacin were monitored down to the 5% (w/w) concentration level in inert polymer matrices such as sodium alginate. By applying metal nanoparticles in SERS drug analy- sis, Cunningham and coworkers [20] reported a design of an optical device to identify and measure the drug contents of the fluid in an intravenous line in real time. They incorporated into the tubing a nanostructured gold substrate to observe the SERS signals of the drugs. Re- ported results for drugs including morphine, metha-done, phenobarbital, promethazine, and mitoxantrone found to be of trace concentrations. The system has proved its capability for the fast analysis of two drugs combination solutions. The system could also be useful in urinary catheters, in hospital care, and in pharmaceu- tical manufacturing. Raman spectroscopy has been ap- plied to the analysis of Chinese medicines. Feng, et al. [21] and Huang, et al. [22] reported a methodology for the detection of some traditional Chinese drugs by SERS. Intense SERS bands were observed due to the strong in - teraction of the drugs with the silver colloid. Thus, SERS technique has a great potential for quick, effective, ac-curate, and nondestructive analysis. Huang, et al.
