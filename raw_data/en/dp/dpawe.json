They work synergistically to soften and break up accumulated waste material in the intestinal tract.* Please note Herbal Nutrition is now in clear capsules due to manufacturer's discontinuance of green capsules. Herbal Nutrition was created shortly after [Chomper](https://www.ariseandshine.com/chomper/). These two formulas were the ultimate result of [Richard Anderson's](https://www.ariseandshine.com/founder-richard-anderson/) 1986 herbal expedition that ended in a high Sierra Mountain meadow where his \"wild salads\" had the effect of stimulating the release of hardened \"mucoid plaque\" from his intestinal tract!* Herbal Nutrition stands the test of time. Tried and true, Herbal Nutrition is formulated with all natural high quality herbs that are vitamin and mineral rich. Herbal Nutrition has been used for over 30 years by tens of thousands of satisfied cleansers before, during, and after cleansing for superior nutritional support.* See our [Cleanse Guide](https://www.ariseandshine.com/download/cleanse-guide/) for suggested intake while cleansing. * These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
