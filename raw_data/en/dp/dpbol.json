Can anything be done about your jiggling cottage-cheese thighs? With age, more than 80 percent of adult women notice cellulite's telltale rippling and dimpling on their thighs, buttocks and abdomen. Exercise, diets, expensive creams\u2014nothing seems to banish lumpy, bumpy cellulite. As collagen breaks down, fat cells enlarge and become trapped in sagging bands of fibrous tissue. Salons and spas offer relaxing, but largely ineffective, loofahing, vacuum massage, heating pads, body wraps and ultrasonic treat - ments designed to break down fatty deposits. While liposuction does shape and contour the body, it is futile for treating skin that has lost its elasticity. Popular in France for decades, \"mesotherapy\" consists of multiple sub - cutaneous (under the skin) injections of acids, phospholipids and enzymes rumored to dissipate cellulite. New techniques that use lasers and pulses of electrical energy have largely replaced needles that cause painful bruising. Although various \"fat-breaking\" chemical cocktails have been tried, none have been proven to erase cellulite. Beware of high-priced creams that promise to \"melt away\" cellulite. Aerobic exercise involving running long hills or up and down stadium stairs is probably the only way to tone muscles and tighten sagging flesh. Sodium is a highly reactive metal that explodes in water and burns in air. When mixed with chlorine, it creates sodium chloride, otherwise known as common table salt. In Ancient Rome, workers were paid in salt (the origin of the word salary.) Salt is widely added to processed snacks and fast food, but is it really bad for you? The American Heart Association warns individuals to restrict daily salt intake to 2,300 milligrams of sodium, about a teaspoonful of salt. Sodium is necessary for regulation of the blood, transmission of nerve impulses, heart activity, and certain metabolic functions. In the body, sodium and potassium ions help to regulate and balance fluids. On average, a Western diet provides more than five times the recom - mended daily allowance of sodium. When buying groceries, check food labels, which are required to list sodium content in milligrams (mg). To earn a low-sodium label, an item must contain less than 140 mg per serving. High levels of sodium may be lurking in soups, salad dressing, canned vegetables, cereal, deli meats and soy sauce. Over the years, scientific research has linked excess dietary sodium intake to cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure, also called hypertension. In 2001, a landmark study funded by the National Institutes of Health found that a condition called \"salt sensitivity\"\u2014which can only be measured in a research lab\u2014increases the risk of death even in someone with no hypertension. In those who are salt-sensitive, the sea - soning can cause an exaggerated, and risky, spike in blood pressure. New research is examining the role of genetics in salt sensitivity, as well as the interplay of stress, inflammation and hypertension on kidney function and sodium metabolism. Salty Story 2PIONEERING PROCEDURES While cardiac surgery survival rates have soared in the past decade, patients have occasionally been left with serious brain injury after long, difficult operations. Today, thanks to a non-invasive brain-oxy - gen monitoring device\u2014the In Vivo Spec - troscopy (INVOS) Cerebral Oximeter\u2014the surgical team can quickly respond to any sudden or sharp drop in blood oxygen. Hartford Hospital makes every effort to ensure patient safety and optimal out - comes with state-of-the-art technology and intensive training. In keeping with the hospital's commitment to excellence, the cardiac surgery team continuously monitors brain oxygen levels during every open-heart surgery as part of the standard of care. \"INVOS gives cardiac surgeons more information on which to base an interven - tion,\" explains David J. Underhill, M.D., a surgeon with Connecticut Cardiothoracic Surgical Associates, who was instrumental in bringing the technology to Hartford Hos - pital. \"We have real-time ability to measure oxygen saturation in both the right and left frontal lobes of the cerebral cortex. During complex cardiac surgery, brain oxygenation can fall to potentially damaging levels be - fore any outward sign of trouble appears.\" INVOS gives the surgical team a \"win - dow to the brain\" through a pair of sensors Light Source Shallow Detector Deep Detector The INVOS System uses two depths of light penetration to subtract out surface data, resulting in a regional oxygenation value for deeper tissues. affixed to the forehead, easily tolerated by even the most fragile cardiac patient. A beam of invisible, near infrared light passes through skin and bone to determine the oxygen saturation level in the region of the brain just below. The sensor measures the color of the hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying portion of the red blood cell, which varies in pigmentation depending on its oxygen content. The FDA has approved the device for adult and pediatric use whenever patients may be at risk for low oxygenation. \"Because of Hartford Hospital's commit - ment to patient safety, we want to use any technology that can prevent a potential stroke or other adverse event,\" says Dr. Un - derhill. In the operating suite, a highly coordi - nated team of anesthesiologists, perfusion - ists, surgeons and critical care nurses keeps a close eye on oxygen levels as the heart- lung machine takes over breathing functions for an unconscious patient. \"If the individual's blood count starts to go too low during surgery, we can venti - late more vigorously or administer a blood transfusion to ensure that the brain is not deprived of oxygen,\" says Dr. Underhill. Pa - tients also spend less time in the intensive care unit on a respirator post-operatively, which means they go home sooner.When Brain Oxygen Levels Fall 3Making Babies Infertility specialist Linda Chaffkin, M.D., visits a newborn baby in the nursery.When everything goes right, the egg pops, the sperm swim, the embryo implants and the baby arrives. But for childless couples, it all seems impossibly arduous and exhausting. Infertile couples endure shots, sex at the whim of a basal thermometer, semen analysis and surgery in the hope of having a baby. As age 40 looms, panic strikes. The idea of never having a child brings unimaginable grief and despair. While infertility is defined as failure to con - ceive after a year of trying, most specialists urge women over 35 to seek treatment after six months. The odds of conception plummet as women age. \"Although some super-fertile women appear to conceive easily after 40, it's usually not their first pregnancy,\" says reproductive endocrinolo - gist Linda Chaffkin, M.D., an infertility specialist with Hartford Hospital's Center for Fertility and Women's Health. \"Women who delay childbirth may have more difficulty becoming pregnant, but it's a delicate balance. People must be ready to bring a child into their lives.\" Up to 12 percent of women of reproductive age are being treated for infertility nationwide, according to the latest statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With private and foreign adoption costing upwards of $25,000, infertile couples are increasingly turning to \"as - sisted reproductive technologies\" in the hope of having a child. An estimated 2.5 million married couples in the United States are infertile because of pelvic inflammatory disease, poor sperm qual - ity, endometriosis or ectopic (outside the womb) pregnancies. Dr. Chaffkin also works with single women and lesbian couples who are having diffi - culty having a baby through artificial insemination with donor sperm. Thighs taut, botoxed and tummy tucked, American women may look and feel younger than their mothers did at 35 or 40, but they still haven't figured out how to turn back the hands of time on the biological clock. \"You're born with a finite number of eggs in your ovaries,\" says Dr. Chaffkin. \"Although new reproductive techniques increase the chance of pregnancy, some women enter menopause in their thirties. With increas - ing maternal age, eggs don't fertilize as well and there's a much higher probability of a genetic abnormality.\"Older women are already at risk for potentially dangerous pregnancy-related conditions like toxemia or preeclampsia (high blood pressure) that affect both the mother and her unborn child. After 40, the ovaries don't always respond to fertility drugs and the uterus supports early pregnancy less well. Miscarriage rates are high, and the embryos often don't survive because of genetic defects. Assisted Reproductive Technologies Well over a million \"test-tube\" babies have been born worldwide since IVF began in England with the birth of Louise Joy Brown in 1978. Each year, more than 150 of Dr. Chaffkin's patients undergo the procedure. Most experience a diz - zying roller coaster of hope and despair during treatment, which often requires multiple cycles. \"The pregnancy rate declines with maternal age,\" says Dr. Chaffkin. \"People have to be realistic. But thanks to advances in laboratory culture and embryology techniques, success rates for IVF ap - proach 50 percent in women under 35.\" For a woman with irreparably damaged or blocked fallopian tubes, assisted reproduction of - fers her only chance to have a baby. Drug \"cock - tails\" stimulate the ovaries and trick the body into releasing eggs. In in vitro fertilization , or IVF, the woman takes fertility drugs to make her ovulate multiple eggs, the eggs are retrieved transvaginal - ly under ultrasound visualization, sperm fertilize the eggs in a petri dish in a laboratory, and the embryos are transferred through a thin flexible plastic catheter into her uterus. Transferring only one or two embryos minimizes potentially risky multiple births. Although improved cell culture techniques mean that four out of five eggs fertil - ize, transferred embryos don't always implant properly in the uterus. Up to a third of those embryos spontaneously abort. For a woman who has conceived a baby through IVF, losing it to a miscarriage or an ectopic preg - nancy seems a cruel irony. An ectopic pregnancy destroyed one of Michelle's* ovaries and left the fallopian tube leading to the other one perma - nently blocked. \"I don't try to get pregnant apart from IVF,\" says Michelle, who is 36. \"There's a very good chance of having another ectopic pregnancy and I can't afford to lose my other ovary. I know American women may look and feel younger than their mothers did at 35 or 40, but they still haven't figured out how to turn back the hands of time on the biological clock. 5PHYSICIAN PROFILE Amy Kirkpatrick Brown, MD Amy Kirkpatrick Brown, M.D., M.P.H., recently joined Hartford Hospital as a gynecologic oncologist. A graduate of Brown University and Tufts University School of Medicine, she also holds a master's degree in public health. She did her residency at the University of Rochester Medi - cal Center and her fellowship in women's oncology at Women and Infants' Hospital in Providence. A Board-certified obstetrician-gyne - cologist with a specialty in gyneco - logic oncology, her areas of interest include cervical, endometrial, ovarian and gynecologic cancer. She performs minimally invasive surgery using the da Vinci Surgical System from Intuitive Surgical, Inc. Robotic surgery's precision allows her to perform robotic gynecologic oncology surgery with less trauma, blood loss and hospital time . In 2006, Dr. Brown won the Brown Medical School Dean's Teaching Excellence Award. Dr. Brown grew up in Wethersfield, and her husband, also a physician, grew up in West Hartford. They recently bought a house, which they are enjoying along with their two cats. how much wishful thinking takes over, how much hope, and it's all enhanced by hormones.\" \"I couldn't allow myself to hope,\" says Allie*, whose was con - ceived through IVF. \"I just couldn't believe it until I saw that little head emerging from me. I thought for sure some tragedy was going to snatch it away at the last minute.\" Many Causes of Infertility Nancy* has endometriosis, a mysterious disease in which the tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside the womb, in places as remote from the reproductive organs as the lungs, or in rare cases, the brain. The painful condition is usually treated with laparascopic surgery and drugs. No one knows why endometriosis causes infertility, or even if it does, since some women still manage to conceive. Endometrio - sis, which afflicts five million women in the United States, is endemic among women who have delayed childbearing until their 30s, when fertility tends to diminish naturally. IVF also can help when the male has a low sperm count or a large percentage of abnormal sperm because it weeds out all but the stron - gest swimmers. While Dr. Chaffkin used to counsel couples with male factor infertility to use a sperm donor, today's technologies often allow couples to conceive a biological child. To fertilize the egg, sperm are injected directly into the cytoplasm in a breakthrough technique for male factor infertility called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Recently, researchers at New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell found more DNA damage in the sperm cells of men with diabetes. In both men and women, obesity disrupts hormone function and reduces fertility. Younger women turn to IVF for problems caused by pelvic inflamma - tory disease, endometriosis, damaged fallopian tubes or \"unexplained\" infertility. IVF is the biological last stop for infertile women. Early Screening Although most infants are born healthy, any pregnant woman can have a fetus with a chromosomal (genetic) disorder. This is particularly true if she has risk factors such as advanced maternal age or a previous child with abnormalities. \"About 30 to 40 percent of infants with Down syndrome are born to mothers older than 35 years,\" explains Charles J. Ingardia, M.D., director of Maternal/Fetal Medicine at Hartford Hospi - tal. \"Often, however, after finally achieving pregnancy these mothers don't want to chance the small risk of definitive, but invasive, testing procedures like amniocentesis.\" Traditionally, testing for such chromosome abnormalities often had to be delayed to 16-20 weeks of pregnancy. Now, screening for these abnormalities is possible as early as 11-12 weeks of pregnancy. This first-trimester screen involves a specific ultrasound measurement of the clear space in the tissue at the back of the developing baby's neck *Not their real names 6(nuchal translucency) and a finger stick or blood test. \"It has been shown that this screening will detect 90 percent of all fetuses with chromosome abnormalities,\" says Dr. Ingardia. \"Early testing can pro - vide reassurance to couples that they are at low riskfor these abnor - malities.\" Surviving Cancer, Giving Birth In women with cancer, the challenge for physicians is to treat the disease aggressively while still preserving fertility. \"Traditionally, the tendency was to remove all the reproductive organs when someone had cancer,\" says Amy Brown, M.D., a gynecologic oncologist at Hartford Hospital. \"Today, less radical surgeries allow preservation of fertil - ity in women with early ovarian or cervical cancer. New chemotherapy regimens and biologically targeted drugs may allow young women with early cancer to keep their ovaries or uterus.\" Breast cancer survivors at increased risk for ovarian cancer because of genetic factors can take medications to lower their risk of disease until they are ready to have a family. For cancer patients who have been treated with strong chemotherapy to turn off the body's hor - mones, restarting the biological clock takes skillful timing. After taking tamoxifen, breast cancer survivors may need help from a reproductive endocrinologist to begin ovulating normally again. While women are born with a million eggs in their ovaries, only about 300,000 are left by puberty, and just 300 are ovulated during the reproductive years. Women whose ovaries have been removed or whose \"ovarian reserve\" is low may still be able to give birth to a child by using donor eggs. IVF success rates approach 50 percent per cycle when an older woman uses donor eggs instead of her own. \"The eggs make all the difference because the uterus of an older patient can be effectively prepared for implantation,\" says Dr. Chaffkin. \"It raises all kinds of ethical issues. Currently, 52 is the maximum age for consideration for IVF using donor eggs.\" Fast Forward For infertile women, nothing compares to the pain of sitting in the gynecologist's office surrounded by pregnant women. Caring and com - passionate nurses at the Center for Fertility in Women's Health try to be sensitive to patients' emotional needs. Yoga and relaxation techniques can help women cope. \"Infertility treatment is a high-stress situa - tion,\" says Dr. Chaffkin. \"We ask patients how they're feeling and, if necessary, refer them to psychologists trained in working with infertile couples, as well as to the support group RESOLVE.\" Donor eggs, surrogacy, better fertility drugs, smaller needles and less painful injection techniques are helping more women than ever have babies. Lengthy treatments are forgotten as heartbreak turns to joy in the delivery room. \"My work is incredibly rewarding,\" says Dr. Chaffkin. \"Every baby is a miracle.\"\"Every baby is a miracle.\" High-resolution sonograms, together with a simple blood test, can reveal chromosomal defects as early as 11 weeks. 7Cool Therapy Saving Brain Function after Cardiac Arrest Jeffrey Kluger, M.D., (left) and Justin Lundbye, M.D., introduced \"cool therapy\" to Hartford Hospital, the first medical center in the region to use hypothermia for patients who have been resuscitated.Alberto*, a 57-year-old Latino, had a history of dia - betes and high blood pressure. While driving, Alberto told his wife he felt dizzy and then lost consciousness. State police performed CPR by the side of the road until paramedics arrived and twice shocked his heart with a defibrillator to resuscitate him. We've all seen it on TV\u2014the jumpy heart rhythm, paddles on the chest, people yelling \"clear!\"\u2014but in real life sudden cardiac arrest is nearly always fatal. Nearly 95 percent of vic - tims die before reaching the hospital. Within minutes of Alberto's arrival at Hartford Hos - pital\u2014the first medical center in Connecticut to employ a new therapeutic hypothermia technique after cardiac arrest\u2014physicians began dropping his core body tem - perature in a desperate effort to save his brain function. Because the heart stops pumping when a clot blocks a coronary artery, it must be restarted within minutes to prevent lasting neurological damage. After five minutes, the brain starts to die. After 30 minutes, the chances of survival are virtually nil. Alberto, who was clinically dead for 25 minutes, just made it under the wire. For the next 36 hours, nurses Paul Kamuzora and Asamoah Anane cared for Alberto as he lay unconscious in the car - diac intensive care unit. Within days, he walked out of the hospital. For Alberto, whose transient blood clot left no lasting damage, hypothermia therapy was a lifesaver. Every day in the United States, about 900 people collapse and die from sudden cardiac arrest. Ac - cording to the American Heart Association, cardiac arrest is a leading cause of premature, permanent disability. Immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) doubles the victim's chances of survival, but even when CPR and chest compressions start the blood flowing again, oxygen starvation may have already jeopardized the brain. Hartford Hospital is among the first medical centers nationwide to adopt an innovative hypother - mia therapy that reduces the brain's need for oxygen, which helps unconscious patients avoid disabling neurological damage. New research shows that cool -ing the body for 24 hours after sudden cardiac arrest can lessen or prevent brain injury caused by oxygen deprivation. An estimated 450,000 Americans suffer cardiac ar - rest each year, costing the health care system about $133 billion annually. Unlike a heart attack, with its crushing chest pain but no loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest causes the heart to quiver uselessly as it stops pumping blood. Beyond the risk of dy - ing from ventricular fibrillation initially, the brain remains vulnerable to a disastrous chemical chain reaction that takes place when the heart is restarted. For days afterward, toxins circulate through the body, damaging DNA, causing inflammation and destroying nerve cells. For patients who remain comatose after cardiac arrest, controlled hypothermia has been shown to save not only lives, but brain function. Over a four-hour period, icy fluids circulate through a cool - ing catheter inserted into the femoral vein, rapidly dropping the internal temperature. Cooling the body's temperature to about 93 degrees Fahrenheit re - duces the brain's demands for oxygen and helps heal wounded tissues. Even before someone arrives at the hospital after cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation, the hypothermia team goes into action to provide advanced life support. \"Our first goal is to preserve neurological function,\" says cardiologist Jeffrey Kluger, M.D., director of Heart Rhythm Management at Hartford Hospital. \"From the emergency depart - ment to the critical care unit, we bring together the expertise of different disciplines to work as a team to care for these critically ill patients. During 24 hours of hypothermia therapy, one nurse in the intensive care unit constantly monitors the patient's heart rate, blood flow and other indicators.\" Sudden cardiac death occurs equally in both men and women, at an average age of about 60. The risk of death from cardiac arrest is especially high for those who have a family history of cardiac arrest or arrhythmias, as well as for young African Americans, who are more likely than whites to have high blood pressure and high cholesterol. \"The longer someone is 'down'\u2014unconscious, no breathing, no pulse\u2014the worse the prognosis,\" says Justin Lundbye, M.D., medical director of the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit and director of the Cardiology Hospitalist Program at Hartford Hospital. \"Research studies have shown that therapeutic hypothermia improves survival and neurological outcome after cardiac arrest and resuscitation.\" *not his real nameNurses Asamoah Anane (left) and Paul Kamuzora. 9 | in the DOCTOR'S OFFICE | WHAT'S GOING AROUND...News & BreakthroughsThe abdominal aorta, the body's main artery, carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the lower half of the body. Especially in men over age 65, the walls of the vessel may weaken, bulge and leak, creating a dangerous outpouching, or aneurysm. Left untreated, the aneurysm can burst, spilling blood into the abdominal cavity and causing an abrupt drop in blood pressure that is often irreparably fatal. \"We may now have an opportunity to avoid this ticking time bomb,\" says David Drezner, M.D., medical director of Hartford Hospital's Vascular Lab, which offers painless AAA screening with a noninvasive, handheld scanning device. \"With modern techniques of repair, most people can avoid the devastating complications of rupture.\" Each year in the United States, nearly 15,000 people die of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Many of these deaths could have been prevented by early diagnosis and repair. In January, the Screening Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms Very Efficiently (SAAAVE) legislation took effect, mandating Medicare reimbursement for ultrasound evaluation of at-risk individuals. Every year, about 200,000 Americans are diagnosed with AAA. \"No one can predict how fast an aneurysm will grow or how big it will get before it ruptures,\" adds Dr. Drezner. Depending on the size of the aneurysm, patients may be referred for regular follow-up or surgical repair. A physician skilled in catheter-based techniques may be able to place a balloon-like device called an endovascular stent graft, threaded through a tiny catheter, to repair the artery in a minimally invasive procedure. To qualify for ultrasound screening, patients must be referred after an initial preventive physical examination, usually by their primary care physician. Hartford Hospital is the first certified vascular lab in the community to offer screening by registered vascular technicians who are also registered nurses. High-risk patients include males between the ages of 65 and 75 who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, as well as men and women with a family history of the disorder. Here Comes the Sun The first sunscreen ap - proved by the Food and Drug Administration since 1988, L'Or\u00e9al's Anthelios SX is highly protective against short UVA waves. With a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15, it guards against sunburn, ultraviolet A (UVA) rays and ultraviolet B (UVB) rays. UVA waves penetrate deep into the skin and ac - count for 95 percent of the UV radiation that reaches the earth's surface.Sleep on It! As you sleep, your brain is sorting through information, producing insights that could help you make deci - sions, says a new Harvard Medical School study published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Sleep gives you time to make connections and draw inferences from apparently random bits of knowledge, a process that may operate below the level of conscious awareness.Performance Anxiety The pressure of perfection can be exhausting, warns a psychological study from the University of Zurich in Switzerland. In trying situ - ations, perfectionists tend to get more stressed than people with more realistic standards. When facing a challenge, perfectionists felt more anxious and neu - rotic\u2014and had measurably higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol\u2014than their peers with low levels of perfectionism.Blueberry Thrill Wild blueberries are highest in antioxidant capacity per serving compared to other fruits. Previous animal studies have shown blueberries to be protec - tive against Alzheimer's disease, cancer, urinary tract infections and damage from ischemic stroke. Now, Tufts University researchers say eating blueberries and strawberries slows age-re - lated declines in memory and cognitive function, at least in rats.Medicare Screening for AAA Repair 10Early signs of bipolar disorder, formerly called manic-depressive illness, usually appear in late adolescence or early adulthood. Abnormal brain chemistry and faulty circuitry appear to spark the manic outbursts and crippling depressions that affect more than two million Americans each year. Most cases of the recurrent mood disorder arise in individuals with a family history of mental illness, suggesting a strong genetic influence. Bipolar disorder is significantly under-recognized and is often misdiagnosed as schizophre - nia, especially since 60 percent of bipolar patients with acute mania display psychotic symptoms of thought disorder, hallucinations and delusions. Ethnic differences have been shown to be a confounding factor. One-third of all bipolar patients\u2014but two-thirds of older African-American bipolar patients\u2014are misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia. Because mood stabilizers and antipsychotic drugs are highly effective in treating bipolar disorder, accurate diagnosis and early treatment are vital. During severe manic phases, individuals often exhibit intense energy, euphoria and irritability. At other times, disabling depressions, with or without psychosis, leave bipolar patients feeling despondent. Left untreated, as many as 20 percent of bipolar individuals eventually kill themselves. Different brain mechanisms appear to underlie symptoms of disorganized and incoherent speech in patients with bipolar and schizophrenia disorders. \"The fact that both patient groups exhibit the same symptoms makes it difficult to distinguish between them clinically, especially in the beginning of an illness,\" explains Michal Assaf, M.D., a senior research scientist at the Olin Neuro - psychiatry Research Center at the Institute of Living (IOL). \"Because treatment for bipolar disorder can improve prognosis, we are currently collecting data to see if we can identify the pathology of brain functions that underlie a core symptom of psychotic bipolar and schizophrenia patients\u2014 formal thought disorder (FTD).\" Neuroscientists at the IOL use sophisticated, noninvasive tools like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to analyze the firing of brain cells and identify abnormal structural or functional regions of the brain. With grant support from the Donaghue Foundation and Hartford Hospital donors, Dr. Assaf has developed an objective tool to investigate the neurobiology of FTD. Because schizophrenia has been shown to affect areas of the brain involved in semantic processing, Dr. Assaf is mapping brain activity with fMRI as patients perform a semantic object-recall fMRI task. \"Currently, the most accepted hypothesis is that FTD is strongly associated with impaired se - mantic processing,\" says Dr. Assaf. \"We have shown that the fMRI test can distinguish schizophre - nia patients from healthy controls. Now we are enrolling patients with acute psychosis to see if we can use fMRI as a diagnostic tool to distinguish between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.\" For more information about Dr. Assaf's research study, call 545-7893.Diagnostic Distinctions 11Call the Health/Physician Referral Service at (860) 545-1888 or (800) 545-7664 for information about any program.

Using 1 tablespoon of the oil, coat a 9-inch springform pan, round cake pan or pie plate and set aside. Bring 2\u00bc cups water to a boil with 1 tablespoon of the oil in a medium saucepan. Whisking constantly, slowly add the cornmeal. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring, until the cornmeal starts to pull away from the sides of the pan, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the salt, \u00bc teaspoon of the pepper and the Parmesan. Remove from heat. (If desired, heat the cornmeal in a cast-iron skillet before putting into the oven for a crustier crust.) Spread the cornmeal over the bottom of the prepared pan, using a spoon to form a raised edge. In a bowl, combine the radicchio, tomatoes, mozzarella and the remaining oil and pepper. Spoon the mixture over the cornmeal. Top with oven-roasted onions, olives or fresh or dried wild mushrooms (soaked in water first). Bake for 30 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling. Cut into wedges. Serves 8.

Despite decades of warnings, experts say Americans still consume too much sodium, adding to their risks for high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke. Beware of pizzas (frozen or delivery) that may be stuffed with a day's worth of hidden sodium and artery-clogging saturated fat. Now is the season for red, ripe tomatoes and fresh garden veggies, with their rich summery flavors and healthful fiber. Be selective when choosing cheese toppings \u2014 mozzarella contains only half the sodium of Parmesan. Saturated Fat: 2.5 g Monounsaturated Fat: 3.4 g Calcium: 156 mg Sodium: 536.5 mg "}
