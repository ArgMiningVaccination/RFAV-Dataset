A product authorized for emergency use has not undergone the same type of review by FDA as an FDA-approved product. FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of the scientific evidence available showing that the product may be effective to prevent COVID -19 during the COVID -19 pandemic and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product . All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used during the COVID -19 pandemic. An EUA is in effect for the duration of the COVID -19 EUA declaration justifying emergency use of this product, unless terminated or revoked (after which the product may no longer be used).
