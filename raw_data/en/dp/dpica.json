In recognition of the gift, the unit will be named The Jack Martin Fund Inpatient Unit for Children's Cancer and Blood Disease, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held Tuesday, February 27, at 5:15 pm. The 5,300-square-foot unit features eight private beds, including two isolation rooms with negative air pressure to protect immunocompromised children from infection. A nurses' station easily accessible to all patient rooms provides a close connection to the clinical team and facilitate quick responses to patients. In addition, the unit reflects Mount Sinai's commitment to family-centered care, featuring a family lounge, kitchen, and playroom for younger children. The unit's playful design and calming palette creates an environment that promotes healing and wellness. \"The Jack Martin Fund's extraordinarily generous gift represents a critical step toward Mount Sinai's goal of transforming children's health care,\" said Kenneth L.
