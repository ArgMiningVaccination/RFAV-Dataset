Lightsabers consisted of a [plasma](/wiki/Plasma) blade, powered by a [kyber crystal](/wiki/Kyber_crystal), that was emitted from a usually metal [hilt](/wiki/Lightsaber_hilt) and could be shut off at will. It was a weapon that required skill and training, and was greatly enhanced when used in conjunction with [the Force](/wiki/The_Force). Though also used by the Sith, the lightsaber was synonymous with the Jedi, with some in [the galaxy](/wiki/The_galaxy) believing only Jedi could use lightsabers. Lightsabers were generally used for both [offense](/wiki/Lightsaber_combat) and defense. A lightsaber could cut through virtually anything, from [flesh](/wiki/Dismemberment) to blast doors. The only ways to block the incoming attack of a lightsaber was with a [weapon made with material that conducted energy](/wiki/Category:Electrical_weaponry), such as an [electrostaff](/wiki/Electrostaff), a [Z6 riot control baton](/wiki/Z6_riot_control_baton), some rare metals like [beskar](/wiki/Beskar), or another lightsaber. When used defensively, a Force-sensitive could deflect [blaster](/wiki/Blaster) bolts with a lightsaber, and with skill, could even reflect the shots back toward the shooter or some other target. Experienced Jedi could even employ their lightsabers to absorb [Force lightning](/wiki/Force_lightning). Most practitioners used one single-bladed lightsaber, though some used [double-bladed lightsabers](/wiki/Double-bladed_lightsaber) or even multiple lightsabers at once. A popular example to using multiple lightsabers is Grievous. Lightsaber combat was don't get to treat many lightsaber wounds. It's such an old weapon. People today prefer to fight with rifles and blasters, from long range.\" - [Harter Kalonia](/wiki/Harter_Kalonia), to [Rey](/wiki/Rey_Skywalker) no other weapon in [the galaxy](/wiki/The_galaxy), [[17]](#cite_note-Light_of_the_Jedi-17) lightsabers were used thousands of years before the [age of the Galactic Republic](/wiki/Republic_Era), seeing use in the [Great Scourge](/wiki/Great_Scourge_of_Malachor) of [Malachor](/wiki/Malachor). [[18]](#cite_note-Twilight_of_the_Apprentice-18) They were also used in [Battles of Rashfond](/wiki/Battles_of_Rashfond) and the [Peacekeeping of Parliock](/wiki/Peacekeeping_of_Parliock), [[1]](#cite_note-A_Test_of_Strength-1) The was an ancient type of prototype lightsaber. [[19]](#cite_note-Star_Wars_Show-19) Lightsabers took on a more prominent role in galactic affairs as the [Clone Wars](/wiki/Clone_Wars) came to pass. [Jedi](/wiki/Jedi_Order), previously peacekeepers, became [Jedi Generals](/wiki/Jedi_General) of the [Grand Army of the Republic](/wiki/Grand_Army_of_the_Republic), and thus began using their lightsabers more often than they had in their role of peacekeeping. [[20]](#cite_note-TCW-20) For the majority of the Empire's reign, the only lightsabers that were prominently used were those of [Darth Vader](/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker) and the [Inquisitors](/wiki/Inquisitorius) who served him. In its waning years, it saw a rise in lightsaber use by Jedi survivors and those lightsaber through the [Tagge protoblade](/wiki/Tagge_protoblade). [[21]](#cite_note-WotBH_Boushh-21) After the Empire was defeated, Luke began training a new generation of Jedi. They, however, were killed in the [destruction of his Jedi temple](/wiki/Destruction_of_the_Jedi_Temple), once again leading to a time where the only prominent lightsaber user was a [darksider](/wiki/Dark_side_of_the_Force), [Kylo Ren](/wiki/Ben_Solo). [[15]](#cite_note-Episode_VII-15) That all changed when a scavenger, Rey, discovered the [Skywalker lightsaber](/wiki/Skywalker_lightsaber) [[15]](#cite_note-Episode_VII-15) and ultimately came to train under Luke Skywalker and his twin sister Leia Organa to combat Kylo Ren and the First Order during a war against the Imperial Remains. [[22]](#cite_note-Episode_VIII-22) After the war, Rey ritually buried her masters' [lightsabers](/wiki/Leia%27s_lightsaber) at the [Lars Homestead](/wiki/Lars_Homestead) on Luke's home planet, Tatooine, to end the Skywalker family's suffering. She ignited [her newly crafted lightsaber](/wiki/Rey%27s_lightsaber) to show her complete journey as a Jedi, and, to honor the Skywalkers' legacy, she took the Skywalker name as her surname after receiving the blessing from the [Force ghosts](/wiki/Force_spirit) of her teachers when she was asked by a local. [[23]](#cite_note-Episode_IX-23) Mechanics and specifications[ ] Components[ ] - \"A lightsaber has five main parts. The power cell, the casing, the focusing lens, the emitter and, of course, the crystal. The rest is just wiring, an on/off switch, and whatever fancy extra bits people want to build in. All in all though, it's a pretty simple device.\" - Doctor [Cuata](/wiki/Cuata) A lightsaber drew power from an appropriately-sized power cell. [[25]](#cite_note-Path_of_the_Jedi-25) Parts that would work to make a lightsaber include modulation circuits and an energy gate. Ones that were necessary included a blade emitter shroud, the [emitter matrix](/wiki/Emitter_matrix) and some type of activator to turn the weapon on and off. Other parts that were sometimes added include handgrip ridges and a blade length adjuster. [[25]](#cite_note-Path_of_the_Jedi-25) [[12]](#cite_note-Visual_Guide-12) Some lightsabers also featured a non-lethal low-power setting used for training. [[26]](#cite_note-Chopper_Base-26) Single-bladed lightsabers usually had a belt ring so they could be hung from a belt hook, or a wheel-shaped attachment that slotted into a matching belt clip on the owner's belt when not in use. [[27]](#cite_note-Episode_I-27) [[5]](#cite_note-Episode_II-5) [[28]](#cite_note-Episode_III-28) [[29]](#cite_note-Spark_of_Rebellion-29) [[25]](#cite_note-Path_of_the_Jedi-25) Specially designed such as [Kylo Ren's lightsaber](/wiki/Kylo_Ren%27s_lightsaber), which featured two laterally facing vents designed to divert excess energy away from the cracked crystal and keep the lightsaber stable. This also had the effect of creating a protective [crossguard](/wiki/Crossguard_lightsaber). [[30]](#cite_note-TFA_VD-30) During assembly, it was important to not accidentally invert the emitter matrix; when activated the lightsabers' power grid would backfire. At best this could cause the blade to quickly short out, but if it was left on, the faulty weapon would violently explode, potentially killing those in close proximity. [[1]](#cite_note-A_Test_of_Strength-1) Aesthetics[ ] - \"It's a metal cylinder, about this long, with black grips and a few switches on the side.\" - Luke Skywalker describes a lightsaber [Lightsaber hilts](/wiki/Lightsaber_hilt) were made up of multiple parts that enveloped and protected the internal components. Metal ranging from simple alloys to [Haysian smelt](/wiki/Haysian_smelt) [[32]](#cite_note-Fallen_Order-32) was usually chosen to make up the hilt. However, other materials were also chosen by lightsaber users, such as the [Jedi youngling](/wiki/Jedi_Initiate) [Gungi](/wiki/Gungi), who made use of [a lightsaber](/wiki/Gungi%27s_lightsaber) with a casing carved from the wood of a [Brylark tree](/wiki/Brylark_tree), whose wood was as strong as metal. [[1]](#cite_note-A_Test_of_Strength-1) Some hilts were even crafted with gems. [[33]](#cite_note-Dark_Disciple-33) Inlays decorating the hilt could be made of materials such as [pastillion ore](/wiki/Pastillion_ore), [black onk](/wiki/Black_onk), or the bone of certain creatures such as the [Cartusion whale](/wiki/Cartusion_whale). [[1]](#cite_note-A_Test_of_Strength-1) Each piece of the hilt was aesthetically tailored towards one of multiple different design philosophies, which both informed and were informed by the maker's choice of materials, ideology, and personal preferences. [[32]](#cite_note-Fallen_Order-32) [[34]](#cite_note-Galaxy's_Edge-34) [[35]](#cite_note-Savi's_Workshop-35) A more practical design choice a user could make was to fit the weapon to their [species](/wiki/Species)' particular handgrip. [[36]](#cite_note-Heir_to_the_Jedi-36) The Jedi Order of the [late Galactic Republic](/wiki/Republic_Era) made use of four styles: Duty and Resolve, Peace and Justice, Elemental Nature, and Valor and Wisdom. [[32]](#cite_note-Fallen_Order-32) [[34]](#cite_note-Galaxy's_Edge-34) The former two were simple designs intended to reflect the Jedi commitment to a life of devotion to the Force and the Order's ideals. [[37]](#cite_note-Lightsaber_Styles-37) [[38]](#cite_note-Custom_Lightsaber-38) The latter two made use of resilient natural materials derived from flora and fauna to evoke the living Force. [[37]](#cite_note-Lightsaber_Styles-37) [[38]](#cite_note-Custom_Lightsaber-38) The Sith Order made use of two styles: Passion and Strength, and Power and Control. [[32]](#cite_note-Fallen_Order-32) [[34]](#cite_note-Galaxy's_Edge-34) Both were characterized by sharp and strong forms that showcased their owners' brutality, relentlessness, and insatiable desire for supremacy. [[37]](#cite_note-Lightsaber_Styles-37) [[38]](#cite_note-Custom_Lightsaber-38) Another style, Protection and Defense, was favored by the earliest Force users in ancient times. It featured designs and inscriptions with meanings that have become shrouded in mystery, but the style itself was believed to have been created with the intent of conferring anonymity upon and symbolizing the emotional detachment of the wielder, who would use their lightsaber strictly for personal protection. [[34]](#cite_note-Galaxy's_Edge-34) [[38]](#cite_note-Custom_Lightsaber-38) Cutting power[ ] - \"It's heavier than I thought.\" \"Energy constantly flows through the crystal. You're not fighting with a simple blade as much as you are directing a current of power.\" - [Sabine Wren](/wiki/Sabine_Wren)and [Kanan Jarrus](/wiki/Kanan_Jarrus)on the [Darksaber](/wiki/Darksaber) The power of the energy blade was so great that it could cut through almost anything. One important note about lightsaber wounds was that they rarely bled profusely, even when a limb had been [severed](/wiki/Dismemberment). [[40]](#cite_note-Episode_V-40) [[27]](#cite_note-Episode_I-27) [[5]](#cite_note-Episode_II-5) This was because the energy blade cauterized the wound as it passed, and thus even a severe wound did not tend to bleed heavily. [[28]](#cite_note-Episode_III-28) Lightsaber-resistant materials[ ] Aside from the blade of another lightsaber, there were rare materials that could withstand a lightsaber blade: [Armorweave](/wiki/Armorweave)are material used on various pieces of [clothing](/wiki/Clothing), including [capes](/wiki/Cape), as [armor](/wiki/Armor). It is also capable of resisting a lightsaber strikes. The [Jedi Temple Guard](/wiki/Jedi_Temple_Guard)had special [armor robes](/wiki/Jedi_Temple_Guard_armor)incorporated layers of armorweave to provide them with an effective defense against blaster bolts and lightsabers. [[41]](#cite_note-Nexus-41) [Beskar](/wiki/Beskar)was specially crafted steel made from an iron found only on the planet [Mandalore](/wiki/Mandalore)and its moon [Concordia](/wiki/Concordia), and could repel lightsaber strikes. [[42]](#cite_note-Ultimate_Star_Wars,_New_Edition-42)Examples of its use in that way included [Din Djarin](/wiki/Din_Djarin)'s which resisted [Morgan Elsbeth](/wiki/Morgan_Elsbeth), the magistrate of [Calodan](/wiki/Calodan), which was also used to fight against [Tano's](/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano)sabers. [[43]](#cite_note-Chapter_13-43) - The [Elite Praetorian Guard](/wiki/Elite_Praetorian_Guard#Equipment_and_training)armor was able to resist lightsaber strikes, with the gauntlets being capable of parrying one directly. However, a direct thrust or stab could still penetrate the armor. Their high-tech weapons are also resistant to lightsaber strikes. [[22]](#cite_note-Episode_VIII-22) [Cortosis](/wiki/Cortosis)armor, made by specially weaving cortosis fibers within a protective matrix, was able to redirect a lightsaber's energy into itself which would cause the lightsaber's blade to temporarily shut off upon contact with the armor. [[44]](#cite_note-Thrawn:_Alliances-44) [Magical ichor](/wiki/Magical_ichor)weapons like [Mother](/wiki/Talzin) [Talzin's [personal energy shield](/wiki/Personal_energy_shield)powered by extremely rare [kohlen crystals](/wiki/Kohlen_crystal)was impervious to kyber crystal lightsabers. However, swapping out a lightsabers' kyber crystal for a kohlen crystal would produce a low-powered [orange](/wiki/Orange)blade which was capable of slicing through the shields. [[46]](#cite_note-Master_&_Apprentice-46) - The rare metal [Phrik](/wiki/Phrik)is impervious to lightsaber blades. A staff made of this material was once on display during the [Valo Republic Fair](/wiki/Valo_Republic_Fair), which was taken and used by the [Nihil](/wiki/Nihil) [Tempest to lightsabers. [[50]](#cite_note-Grievous-50) [Qi'ra's electro swords](/wiki/Qi%27ra%27s_electro_swords)are capable of emitting electrical charges to effectively repel and resist clashing with a lightsaber without them being damaged. [[51]](#cite_note-War_of_the_Bounty_Hunters_3-51) Utility[ ] On the all able to use their lightsabers underwater with no ill effects. [[52]](#cite_note-Water_War-52) Whilst in areas of low light, the glowing plasma blade could function as a convenient light source, demonstrated by Jedi Knight the Sith. The designs of Sith lightsabers depended on the user. [[6]](#cite_note-Lightsabers-6) [Double-bladed lightsaber](/wiki/Double-bladed_lightsaber)\u2014Double-bladed lightsabers consisted of a hilt that projected a blade from both ends, resulting in a deadly staff-like weapon. [[27]](#cite_note-Episode_I-27) [Hinged double-bladed lightsaber](/wiki/Hinged_double-bladed_lightsaber)\u2014Was a type of [double-bladed lightsaber](/wiki/Double-bladed_lightsaber)that could fold in half, making it easier to store while not in use. [[55]](#cite_note-Trivia_Gallery-55) [Double-bladed spinning lightsaber](/wiki/Double-bladed_spinning_lightsaber)\u2014A double-bladed spinning lightsaber projected a blade from each end of the hilt. However, the hilt was as long as a single-bladed lightsaber, with a circular rim that, when activated, could spin the blades along a track. [[56]](#cite_note-Rise_of_the_Old_Masters-56)This variant was used by the [Inquisitorius](/wiki/Inquisitorius). [Split saber](/wiki/Split_saber)\u2014A split saber consisted of two separate lightsabers join together forming a double-bladed lightsaber. [[57]](#cite_note-The_Clone_Wars_film-57) [Lightsaber pike](/wiki/Lightsaber_pike)\u2014Featuring two the staff, lightsaber pikes were used by lightsaber](/wiki/Dual-phase_lightsaber)\u2014A dual-phase lightsaber contained one or multiple focusing [crystals](/wiki/Crystal), which allowed its blade length to be extended or shortened in the middle of combat. [[6]](#cite_note-Lightsabers-6) [Broadsaber](/wiki/Broadsaber)\u2014A lightsaber with a broad flat blade that resembled a traditional sword. [[59]](#cite_note-Knights_of_Fate-59) [Magus](/wiki/Magus_(hilt))\u2014A type of was a individuals with a giant statue. [[59]](#cite_note-Knights_of_Fate-59) [Crossguard lightsaber](/wiki/Crossguard_lightsaber)\u2014An ancient design dating back to the [Great Scourge of Malachor](/wiki/Great_Scourge_of_Malachor), a crossguard lightsaber consisted of a standard blade with two shorter blades perpendicular to it at the end of the hilt. [[30]](#cite_note-TFA_VD-30) [Curved-hilt lightsaber](/wiki/Curved-hilt_lightsaber)\u2014Curved-hilt lightsabers were of a design which featured a hilt with a built in curve. This was usually done to allow the hilt to fit better into the palm, facilitating the use of one-handed fighting styles such as [Form II](/wiki/Form_II). [[60]](#cite_note-TVE-60) [Cane lightsaber](/wiki/Cane_lightsaber)\u2014A standard lightsaber concealed as the head of a cane. In combat, the handle would be detached from the body of the cane and wielded normally. [[60]](#cite_note-TVE-60) [Training lightsaber](/wiki/Training_lightsaber)\u2014Training lightsabers were engineered with a permanent low-power setting. As their name indicates, training lightsabers were used for instructional purposes, teaching initiates how to wield a lightsaber. [[61]](#cite_note-SWE_Jedi_Order-61) [Shoto lightsaber](/wiki/Shoto_lightsaber)\u2014A shoto was a short lightsaber. Featuring a shortened blade length, shotos were usually used as the secondary weapon in [dual-blade combat](/wiki/Jar%27Kai). [[6]](#cite_note-Lightsabers-6) [Guard a hilt perpendicular to the blade that gave a unique way of blocking and attacking. [[6]](#cite_note-Lightsabers-6) [Lightwhip](/wiki/Lightwhip)\u2014A lightwhip had a flexible blade that was several meters long, and could entangle opponents. [[62]](#cite_note-GaG-62) - Two-piece lightsaber \u2014A single bladed lightsaber that can separate into two pieces, with the main body and grip of the hilt at the small of his back and the emitter shroud on his left side. Jarrus merely needed to insert the emitter section into the main body and twist to lock them together. [Lightsaber-blaster hybrid](/wiki/Lightsaber-blaster_hybrid)\u2014A single bladed lightsaber with an attachment that allowed it to fire blaster bolts. [[25]](#cite_note-Path_of_the_Jedi-25) [Darksaber](/wiki/Darksaber)\u2014An unique ancient lightsaber with a black blade that was flattened and came to a point like a traditional sword, rather than the rounded beam of standard lightsabers. [[39]](#cite_note-Trials_of_the_Darksaber-39) There also existed a type of blaster known as a [lightsaber rifle](/wiki/Lightsaber_rifle) which was designed to be combined with a lightsaber. To work, the user would insert a standard lightsaber into a slot on top of the rifle. Once loaded, the weapon could fire powerful beams of energy that were highly destructive. [[63]](#cite_note-Dying_Light-63) Additionally both [Jedi Masters](/wiki/Jedi_Master) [Ki-Adi-Mundi](/wiki/Ki-Adi-Mundi%27s_lightsaber) and [Agen Kolar](/wiki/Agen_Kolar%27s_lightsaber) both owned a lightsaber that had two different colored kyber crystals, allowing it to change colors from green to blue. [[64]](#cite_note-ECUC-64) Usage and application[ ] Purpose[ ] - \"We do not want to be powerful. We wish to stand tall against the dark. Our rools reflect that goal. Especially our chosen weapon. We all wield the same one, with minor variations. The lightsaber. We could make kyber bombs or blasters... Indeed, it's been tried. There are a few weapons like that in the sealed archives. But anyone can fire a blaster. Very few can safely and skillfully wield a lightsaber. Everyone in the galaxy knows this to be true. We want our opponents to know that we use a weapon that requires intention. Training, precision and choice. The lightsaber symbolizes the care with which we approach our gifts through the Force and the care with which we wield them. It reminds others that while we could do more... We very purposefully do not. Take it, my Padawan. We choose a weapon with limitations\u2014with difficulties. You cannot use a lightsaber to destroy a city or a planet. Every death or injury it inflicts must be precisely chosen. The lightsaber tells the galaxy that the Jedi are not destroyers. We are protectors.\" - Obi-Wan Kenobi, to Anakin Skywalker The intended purpose of the lightsaber was to bring an end to conflicts, being designed to injure no more than its wielder chose. Additionally, there was no collateral damage from lightsaber strikes [[17]](#cite_note-Light_of_the_Jedi-17) unless the blade happened to hit a target on accident. [[66]](#cite_note-The_Phantom_Apprentice-66) If death was deemed necessary, the blade was designed to kill quickly. Even though the Jedi held themselves to these rules, [[17]](#cite_note-Light_of_the_Jedi-17) the groups like the Sith chose to use their lightsabers in ways that caused suffering. [[67]](#cite_note-Dark_Lord_7-67) Jedi Padawan [Bell Zettifar](/wiki/Bell_Zettifar) felt that the lightsaber was designed to give an enemy a chance to surrender, as its trademark glow and hum made it easy to spot and hear. Furthermore, he believed the blade's sound was one of training, focus, and skill; it was the sound of a Jedi's last resort and was the art of their Order. [[17]](#cite_note-Light_of_the_Jedi-17) Although Sith were also known to wield lightsabers, they viewed the dark side of the Force as their primary weapon, with the saber serving as a symbol of the dark side and the way it consumed all who opposed it. [[68]](#cite_note-Lesson_Vader-68) Combat[ ] - \"Energy constantly flows through the crystal. You're not fighting with a simple blade as much as you are directing a current of power. Your thoughts, your actions, they become energy. They flow through the crystal as well and become a part of the blade.\" - Kanan Jarrus, to Sabine Wren Lightsaber combat was the preferred fighting method used by lightsaber wielders. Throughout the millennia, many combat styles were refined into the seven \"classic\" forms that serve as the standard, [[60]](#cite_note-TVE-60) and numerous other fighting methods that call for advanced levels of skill. Lightsabers were most often held with both hands during combat. [[5]](#cite_note-Episode_II-5) Rituals[ ] - \"By the right of the Council, by the will of the Force, Kanan Jarrus, you may rise.\" - An apparition of The Grand Inquisitor as a Jedi knights Kanan Jarrus Lightsabers were an integral part of the knighting ceremonies of the Jedi Order. [[69]](#cite_note-Shroud_of_Darkness-69) During the ceremony, a Padawan would have their Padawan ritualistically severed by the presiding Jedi crystals were collected from a Jedi's lightsaber if they fell in battle. Many of these crystals were then formed into the [Kyber Arch](/wiki/Kyber_Arch), which became a site for meditation in the Jedi Temple. [[70]](#cite_note-Into_the_Dark-70) Practical applications[ ] Lightsabers were able to cut through most materials.[ [source?](/wiki/Wookieepedia:Sourcing)] The glowing plasma blade could be used as a convenient light source when necessary. [[23]](#cite_note-Episode_IX-23) [[32]](#cite_note-Fallen_Order-32) Lightsabers can also be used to evaporate some liquids due to the heat it generates.[ [source?](/wiki/Wookieepedia:Sourcing)] Behind the scenes[ ] Early concepts[ ] - \"The original concept was that the Jedi would fight with swords, and I wanted to make it a sort of laser sword, to give it that technology edge\" - George Lucas on the early development of the lightsaber The usage of the lightsaber was originally inspired by many of the serials that [George Lucas](/wiki/George_Lucas) watched and enjoyed as a child, which featured many characters wielding swords. When he began conceiving [Star Wars](/wiki/Star_Wars), he wished to include swords, creating the \"lightsaber\" to allow them to better mesh with the futuristic setting. [[71]](#cite_note-BotL-71) In the early incarnations of the Star Wars storyline, lightsabers were not exclusive to the Jedi and other Force-users, but were in fact very mundane. Early concept art depicts lightsabers being wielded by Rebel and Imperial soldiers alike. George Lucas later limited the lightsabers to exclusively the Jedi in order to make them feel more unusual, and heighten the mystique of the Jedi. [[72]](#cite_note-Ldb-72) Also, in early drafts of the script, lightsabers were referred to as \"lazerswords.\"[ [source?](/wiki/Wookieepedia:Sourcing)] Crystals first appear in Star Wars simply as an embedded decoration on the hilt in the original film's [novelization](/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope_(novel)). Aside from this single instance, there are no crystals mentioned in any of the movies or their novelizations. [[73]](#cite_note-E4n-73) Prop design and effects[ ] During the filming of [A New Hope](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_IV_A_New_Hope), the [Anakin/Luke lightsaber](/wiki/Skywalker_lightsaber) was made camera side-attach flash, while [Darth Vader's lightsaber](/wiki/Darth_Vader%27s_lightsaber) was made from a Micro Precision Products flash attachment. The handle grips were made with T-shaped pieces of plastic from sliding glass cabinet windows and, contrary to popular belief, were not made with rubber windshield wipers. D-rings were attached to the bottoms of the units so that they could be worn on belts. [Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightsaber](/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi%27s_third_lightsaber) was the most complex hilt at the time. It was assembled from parts of an Armitage Shanks Starlite model Handwheel, Browning ANM2 machine gun booster, Mk.1 British Rifle Grenade and a Rolls-Royce Derwent Mk.8/Mk.9 Jet Engine Balance Pipe.[ [source?](/wiki/Wookieepedia:Sourcing)] Korean animator [Nelson Shin](/wiki/Nelson_Shin), who was working for DePatie-Freleng Enterprises at the time, was asked by his manager if he could animate the lightsaber in the live action scenes of a film. After Shin accepted the assignment, the live action footage was given to him. He drew the lightsabers with a rotoscope, an animation which was superimposed onto the footage of the physical lightsaber blade prop. Shin explained to the people from Lucasfilm that since a lightsaber is made of light, the sword should look \"a little shaky\" like a fluorescent tube. He suggested inserting one frame that was much lighter than the others while printing the film on an optical printer, making the light seem to vibrate. Shin also recommended adding a degausser sound on top of the other sounds for the weapon since the sound would be reminiscent of a magnetic field. The whole process took one week, surprising his company. Lucasfilm showed Shin the finished product, having followed his suggestions to use an X-Acto knife to give the lightsaber a very sharp look, and to have sound accompany the weapon's movements. [[74]](#cite_note-74) The lightsaber effects during the [original trilogy](/wiki/Original_trilogy) started out in a very complicated manner. During the filming of A New Hope, the blade was made of a three-sided rod covered with reflective material. The rod was then rapidly spun by a compact motor in the hilt, reflecting the lights on set and creating an in-camera glowing effect. However, these props were highly limited; they were cumbersome and fragile, often breaking during fight scenes. Also, the glowing effect was not absolute, as whenever the blade moved out of the light or pointed more directly at the camera the glow disappeared and the actual spinning rod could be seen. In order to partially compensate for this loss of the effect, the blade was rotoscoped and an animated glow was added by tracing onto a blown-up copy of the frame with pen and colored ink, one frame at a time. It was at this phase that blades were given colors, as the props were simple white rods. [[71]](#cite_note-BotL-71) [[72]](#cite_note-Ldb-72) During the filming of [The Empire Strikes Back](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_V_The_Empire_Strikes_Back), it was decided creating an in-camera glowing effect was more trouble than it was worth, so the spinning rods were swapped for carbon rods. While these new blades were less cumbersome than before, they were still very fragile and frequently broke. However, they continued to be used for [Return of the Jedi](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_VI_Return_of_the_Jedi). [[71]](#cite_note-BotL-71) When filming began for [The Phantom Menace](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_I_The_Phantom_Menace), the new lightsaber blades were steel and aluminum rods, which were highly durable, but frequently bent and flexed, requiring constant replacement. [[75]](#cite_note-TLA-75) Despite such a drawback, these rods still saw usage during the filming of [Attack of the Clones](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_II_Attack_of_the_Clones), as they had no alternative at the time. However, for the filming of [Revenge of the Sith](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_III_Revenge_of_the_Sith), the blades were replaced by carbon fiber rods laminated with glass and plastic. These new props were highly durable and didn't flex, though they were extremely hard, often causing bruising and leaving scars. While lightsaber effects were still done by rotoscoping for the [prequels](/wiki/Prequel_trilogy), they were done digitally, rather than by hand. [[72]](#cite_note-Ldb-72) For [The Force Awakens](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_VII_The_Force_Awakens), the lightsaber props glowed, using a similar effect used in Attack of the Clones during the fight between Anakin Skywalker and Count Dooku. In behind the scenes footage, it was revealed that the actors were using blades similar to the ones made by [Master Replicas](/wiki/Master_Replicas). This not only added to the environmental realism that was desired by providing interactive lighting on the actors and the set, but also immersed the actors in the lightsaber experience, building on the performance and convincing nature of the lightsaber effect. [[76]](#cite_note-Dailymotion-76) Colors[ ] Lightsabers depicted in the first two released films, A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, had blades that were colored either blue (for the Jedi) or red (for the Sith). This color difference was a decision during post-production when the lightsaber blades were being rotoscoped, as the original blades were simply white. In Return of the Jedi, Luke's [newly-constructed lightsaber](/wiki/Luke_Skywalker%27s_green_lightsaber) was colored blue during the initial editing of the film, and appears so in both an early movie trailer and the official theatrical posters, but in the final film, it was ultimately colored green in order to better stand out against the blue sky of Tatooine in outdoor scenes and to make it more obvious to the audience that the new lightsaber was different from Luke's one in The Empire Strikes Back. It also appeared as green in re-release posters.[ [source?](/wiki/Wookieepedia:Sourcing)] Both green and blue became standard blade colors for Jedi lightsabers in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. In the same regard, red became the standard Sith lightsaber blade. [Mace Windu](/wiki/Mace_Windu)'s [purple lightsaber](/wiki/Mace_Windu%27s_lightsaber), as first seen in Attack of the Clones, was a personal request from actor [Samuel L. Jackson](/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson) as a way to make his character stand out among other Jedi. Jackson's favorite color is purple and he frequently requests the characters he plays to use an item of the color in his movies. In addition, there are yellow [[77]](#cite_note-Jedi_Temple_Guard-77) [[33]](#cite_note-Dark_Disciple-33) in [The Clone Wars](/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars) and [Rebels](/wiki/Star_Wars_Rebels) animated series. The yellow lightsaber blade made its live-action debut in the final scene of [The Rise of Skywalker](/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_IX_The_Rise_of_Skywalker), as the [new weapon](/wiki/Rey%27s_lightsaber) constructed by [Rey Skywalker](/wiki/Rey_Skywalker). Orange blades appear in the video game [Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order](/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi:_Fallen_Order), as did indigo, A lightsaber with a [kohlen crystal](/wiki/Kohlen_crystal) inside also produced an orange blade, but with an intensity that made it mostly useless against anything other than a specialized type of shield which was also powered by a kohlen crystal. [[46]](#cite_note-Master_&_Apprentice-46) Choreography[ ] While the usage of lightsabers was originally inspired by rapiers featured in the old serials George Lucas enjoyed, the final choreography in A New Hope looked nothing like fencing. As Jedi and their Sith counterparts were heavily inspired by [samurai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai), the fighting styles utilized were based more on [kendo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendo). [[83]](#cite_note-EoD-83) The slower, more strength-oriented moves of kendo used in the Obi-Wan/Vader duel also helped mesh with Lucas' concept that it was a battle between what were essentially two old men. [[71]](#cite_note-BotL-71) During the filming of The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas began ramping up the speed of the duels, making them \"faster and more intense,\" the idea being that Luke Skywalker was becoming increasingly proficient with the weapon. [[71]](#cite_note-BotL-71) Also, rather than utilize [David Prowse](/wiki/David_Prowse), the actor within the Darth Vader costume, for the duels, they instead had professional swordsman Bob Anderson perform the fights, due to Prowse's tendency to repeatedly break the fragile prop blades. Anderson continued to serve as Prowse's fighting double during the filming of Return of the Jedi. When filming began for The Phantom Menace, the new stunt coordinator [Nick Gillard](/wiki/Nick_Gillard) ramped up the speed and agility the characters demonstrated in lightsaber duels, the idea being that the prequels took place when the Jedi Order was in \"full flower,\" at least in terms of combat techniques. [[71]](#cite_note-BotL-71) Gillard was careful to avoid giving the fight scenes a choreographed look, drawing upon his extensive knowledge of martial arts to create the moves. [[84]](#cite_note-JSp-84) The end result was a very fast-paced style of fighting, which he described as being like a chess game between grand masters, with every move being a check. This style of choreography was continued on throughout the prequel trilogy.
