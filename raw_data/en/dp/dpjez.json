However, whether OsteoKing has anti-osteoporotic properties has remained to be elucidated. The purpose of the present study was therefore to investigate the effects of OsteoKing on ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in rabbits. Female New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into an ovariectomized (OVX) group and a sham-surgery group. The rabbits in the OVX group were subjected to an ovariectomy, while the rabbits in the sham group were subjected to the removal of an area of fat near the two ovaries. Bone mineral density, mechanical properties, serum biochemical parameters and micro-architecture were examined at 150 days post-OVX to characterize the experimental animal model. Once the osteoporotic rabbit model had been established, the rabbits in the OVX group were divided into the following groups: Model group, nilestriol group and 300 and 600 mg/kg OsteoKing groups, containing 16 rabbits in each group. OsteoKing and nilestriol were administered orally. The bone mineral density, mechanical properties, serum biochemical parameters, histology and micro-architecture were examined immunosorbent assays, histopathological evaluation and micro-computerized tomography examination following 60 days and 120 days of treatment, respectively. Treatment with OsteoKing led to an elevation in the bone mineral density of the vertebra and serum phosphorus levels, reduced phosphatase 5b and cross-linked N-telopeptide of type I collagen, improved mechanical properties (maximum load, stiffness and energy absorption capacity), and micro-architecture of the lumbar vertebra in the OVX osteoporotic rabbit model following treatment for 120 days. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that OsteoKing is effective in the prevention of estrogen deficiency-associated bone loss and may be a promising drug for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a chronic, metabolic and systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and micro-architectural deterioration, resulting in increased bone fragility and fracture risk ( Heng-Gu-Gu-Shang-Yu-He-Ji (OsteoKing) is a formulation composed of numerous types on a concoction originating from Yunnan Province in China and has been used for >100 years. It has a notable effect in the treatment of bone diseases, particularly for femoral head necrosis, prolapse of the lumbar intervertebral disc and osteoarthritis, and was approved by the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration in 2002 ( The OsteoKing concoction was prepared according to the Chinese Pharmacopeia (China Pharmacopeia Committee, 2002) and was supplied by Crystal Natural Pharmaceutical Co. (Kunming, China). Briefly, A total of 101 female New Zealand white rabbits aged 6 months were obtained from the Animal Center of Kunming Medical University (Kunming, China). Their body weight ranged between 2.5 and 3.0 kg. The animals were housed at a constant temperature (20-25\u00b0C), humidity (40-70%) and light-dark cycle (12/12 h). Tap water was available Following a two-week acclimation period, the animals were randomly allocated into an OVX model group (OVX group, n=76) and a sham-surgery group (sham group, n=25). Animals of the OVX group underwent a bilateral ovariectomy as previously described under general anesthesia with an intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg; Shanghai Westang Bio-tech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), while the sham surgery group was subjected to a procedure involving exposure of the ovaries without excision ( The rabbits were anesthetized with an intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) and the BMD of the vertebrae was measured The second lumbar vertebra was harvested at days 0, 60 and 120 of treatment, frozen at 20\u00b0C prior to the assay and the mechanical properties were measured as described previously ( Blood samples were collected from the central ear artery 150 days following bilateral ovariectomy (day 0 of treatment) and at days 60 and 120 of treatment, respectively, after an overnight fast, consistently between 09:00 and 11:00 A.M. The serum was promptly separated and stored at 80\u00b0C prior to the assay ( The sections of the third lumbar vertebrae, which were harvested 60 or 120 days following treatment, were prepared as described previously ( The first lumbar vertebra, which was harvested 150 days after the bilateral ovariectomy (day 0 of treatment) and 60 days or 120 days after treatment was cleaned of adherent soft tissues and preserved in sealed plastic bags at 20\u00b0C prior to the assay ( All experimental data were assessed using the statistical system SPSS 17.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and values are expressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Differences in the mean values of BMD, serum biochemical parameters, mechanical parameters and structural parameters between the two groups 150 days after OVX were compared using an independent-samples t-test, and those between five groups at the same time -point after treatment were performed using one-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni post hoc test. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. The effects of OsteoKing or nilestriol on the BMD of the vertebrae are presented in The results of the vertebral compression assessment are shown in The results of the serum biochemical assessment are shown in Under the light microscope, following 60 and 120 days of treatment, the histology of the third lumbar vertebra of the sham group exhibited the normal size, shape, density and architecture of the trabecular bone ( At 150 days after ovariectomy, the rabbits of the OVX group exhibited lower values for BV/TV, Tb.Th and Tb.N, and higher values for BS/BV and Tb.Sp (P<0.01), when compared with those in the sham group ( OsteoKing is a Traditional Chinese Medicine, which is widely used in the treatment of bone disease, particularly for femoral head necrosis, prolapse of the lumbar intervertebral disc and osteoarthritis. Previous studies have demonstrated that OsteoKing has an effect on the prevention of fracture and the improvement of the micro-architecture in the necrotic femoral head of rabbits, which indicates that OsteoKing may have anti-osteoporotic effects ( Experimental animal models are important in improving knowledge of the aetiology, pathophysiology and diagnosis of osteoporosis, as well as in the prevention of the condition and development of therapeutics ( Bone turnover markers reflect the rates of bone resorption and bone formation in the whole body, and they provide a representative index of the overall skeletal bone loss ( Compression testing of the lumbar vertebrae is recommended for the assessment of the mechanical properties of cancellous bone ( Previous studies have demonstrated that BMD and the aspects of the trabecular micro-architecture affect trabecular bone strength ( In conclusion, OsteoKing was able to elevate the BMD of the vertebrae, reduce the bone turnover rate, restore the trabecular network and ameliorate the mechanical properties of lumbar vertebra in a rabbit model of ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis. These findings suggested that OsteoKing is potentially useful in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, which occurs in women as a result of estrogen deficiency.
