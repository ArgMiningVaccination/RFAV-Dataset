During the twentieth centurythere were three influenza pandemics that began in1918, 1957 and 1968. Each was caused by a virusrelated to a different avian influenza virus. The threat of a new pandemic resulting from infection with thewidely distributed avian H5N1 viruses, although far from certain, has stimulated considerable work at bothnational and international levels in preparation for thispossibility. We consider that planning and preparednessfor a pandemic need to be informed by the bestavailable scientific evidence at every level. Whilst the UK is better prepared than most countries in planningfor pandemic influenza, there is scope to improve the extent to which scientific evidence is used inpolicymaking. We accept the concerns expressed to us in the evidence we received that there is insufficientdialogue between government departments andscientists on the use to which scientific advice is put.The UK government should therefore be receptive to,and recognise the value of, close interactions with thescientific community in developing policies forpreparedness for any pandemic influenza virus that may emerge. The focus of pandemic planning in the UK is the Ministerial Committee of the Cabinet on InfluenzaPandemic Planning (MISC32), which ultimately guidesall activity in the UK for pandemic preparedness. TheGovernment's Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA) and ChiefMedical Officer (CMO) have a central function inadvising this Committee directly. However, followingevidence submitted to this study, we believe thisCommittee needs a specialist scientific adviser. Wetherefore recommend the appointment of a leadingnon-governmental scientist in the area of influenza asadviser to MISC32 to complement the roles of the CSAand the CMO. This scientist should be appointed jointlyby the CSA and CMO in discussion with relevantlearned societies. This model should be adopted in allfuture ministerial committees for other animal andhuman health emergencies. The role and remit of government science advisory committees in relation to pandemic influenza should bemade explicit and the organisational decision makingroutes should be clarified to show how scientific adviceis utilised. In order to incorporate scientists from a broadrange of disciplines, and the scientific advice beinggenerated by the range of science advisory committeesacross government, into a focal point we recommendthat the Department of Health's Pandemic InfluenzaScientific Advisory Group becomes a cross-governmentScientific Advisory Committee on pandemic influenzajointly chaired by the CMO and the CSA. In addition to relevant cross-governmental representation and the specialist scientific adviser (recommended above), theCommittee's membership should be drawn directly fromthe scientific, veterinary, social science and medicalcommunities as well as from the commercial sector. We also recommend that the Department of Health, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs(Defra) and the Civil Contingencies Secretariat continueto ensure the collection and use of evidence from awide range of sources, both from within and external to government. We urge all departments involved inpandemic preparedness to be open and transparent intheir decision making and to make available as soon aspossible minutes of meetings and the evidence onwhich their decisions are based, in keeping with theCSA's Guidelines on scientific analysis in policy making . Avian influenza The circulation and spread of highly pathogenic avianinfluenza in wild and domestic bird populations remainof great concern, not least in some developing countrieswhere surveillance systems are either absent orinadequately resourced. We recognise the importance ofthe objectives of Defra, together with the WorldOrganisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food andAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), toidentify, control and eradicate avian influenza as quicklyas possible. We urge the UK government to provideadditional financial support for their work and toencourage potential donors to do the same. Epidemiology A wide range of epidemiological data will have animportant role in informing policy decisions andresearch, both before and during a pandemic.Diagnostic data, such as the genotype and phenotypeof the viruses isolated from the first outbreaks, will beimportant in providing early warning of the transmissionof avian influenza to humans and its spread within thepopulation. It is essential that national governmentswork closely with the World Health Organization (WHO)to increase the effectiveness of current data collectionsystems and to share the data that are produced. To ensure the availability of data in a pandemic, we recommend that the UK government leads efforts tocoordinate plans for real-time data collection and datasharing, at both the European and WHO/UN level. Wehope that recent announcements of agreements toshare sequence data within the research community will gain momentum globally. As an essential part of the surveillance data collection, we recommend that theworldwide collection of information on neuraminidaseinhibitor resistance should be increased and madeavailable to those organising treatment regimes. The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 1SummaryAntivirals Antivirals are likely to be the first line of defence in theevent of an influenza pandemic and as such form thebackbone to pandemic preparedness both in the UKand globally. They will be essential in trying to containan initial outbreak wherever it occurs and in reducingtransmission and illness. Owing to the uncertainty aboutthe effective dose of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for differentviruses, we recommend that the Department of Healthcontinues to review the size of the current stockpile ofoseltamivir and considers whether the stockpile shouldbe used for large-scale prophylaxis as well as fortreatment. We also recommend that as a matter ofurgency the Department of Health revisits the decisionnot to stockpile zanamivir (Relenza) at the same level asoseltamivir, especially for use where resistance tooseltamivir is suspected. Moreover, we recommend thatthe Department of Health and the Medical ResearchCouncil (MRC) support research during the early stagesof a pandemic to determine ways to use the currentantivirals most effectively and to ensure the continueddevelopment of new anti-influenza drugs. Vaccination Vaccination will play a key role in a pandemic but itsinitial use may be limited by the time taken to identifythe virus involved and to manufacture, test anddistribute the resulting vaccine. There is unanimousagreement that the worldwide capacity to manufactureinfluenza vaccines will be insufficient in a pandemic.However, there are a number of possibilities for vaccineuse that require further research and evaluation as amatter of urgency. These include: the use of adjuvantsin dose sparing and to broaden the immune response;the use of whole virus vaccines for the same purposes;and the possibility of population-priming at thebeginning of a pandemic with a previously preparedvaccine containing a virus related to the pandemic virus. We find limited evidence that the UK government is engaging with industry or other experts to developincreased and sustained capacity, or new technologiesfor vaccine production. We therefore recommend that,as a matter of urgency, the Department of Health takesthe lead in organising a work programme with industryand academia for the development of new adjuvantsand vaccines. This should be conducted in parallel withclinical trials to compare directly the effectiveness of current adjuvants with existing H5N1 pandemic vaccinesand whole virus vaccines. We also recommend thatthese studies should be supported by governmentfunding, for example though the Department of Healthand the MRC, in partnership with the vaccine industry.More generally, we are concerned that, outside theprocurement process, dialogue between theDepartment of Health, industry and academicimmunologists and vaccine researchers is inadequateand should be improved. Further research A number of initiatives were announced in 2006 by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences ResearchCouncil, MRC and Wellcome Trust to begin to addresssome of the research questions relating to avian andpandemic influenza. We encourage research funders to continue to solicit high-quality proposals in areassuch as basic influenza research (including studies ofpathogenesis), avian immunology, novel antivirals,innovative technologies for vaccine production, novel adjuvants, paediatric vaccination, the use of public health interventions, diagnostics and critical care capacity in a pandemic. If necessary researchfunders should commission specific research in theseareas. We also recommend that research to examinebehavioural modelling assumptions in relation topandemic influenza is commissioned by the Economicand Social Research Council in partnership with otherresearch funders. Forward planning Regardless of whether a pandemic occurs in the nearfuture, surveillance, diagnostic systems and researchprojects put in place now will provide an important basisfor the future monitoring of a range of infectiousdiseases, in addition to avian influenza. It is essentialthat the increased capacity resulting from influenzapandemic preparedness within the UK should bemultifunctional and be applied to other infectious andzoonotic diseases wherever possible. We recommendthat the UK government, in collaboration with WHO,OIE and the scientific and medical communities, shouldreview the potential applications of the data collected,with the aim of improving overall global diseasesurveillance and control. The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 2| November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policy1 Introduction 1.1 Overview The scientific understanding of avian and human influenza must play an important role in both short andlong term planning to deal with the threat of a pandemic.The Royal Society and Academy of Medical Sciencesestablished a joint working group (see Annex 1 for themembership) to examine the extent to which scientificevidence is being incorporated into preparedness for apandemic, and to identify areas where policymakersmight make better use of the scientific evidence in policydevelopment and contingency planning. The study,chaired by Sir John Skehel FMedSci FRS, was launched inMarch 2006 with an open call for evidence to considerthe following questions: \u0081 What does the scientific understanding (basic research to clinical application) of avian andpandemic influenza, in the short and long term,imply for: \u0081treatment: the use of existing, and thedevelopment of, new drugs and vaccines? \u0081clinical ofthe preparedness for an outbreak:modelling and surveillance? \u0081 What lessons can be learnt from other disease outbreaks and more general public emergencies andthe associated emergency planning responses? \u0081 How do wider ethical, social and regulatory issues, including those associated with the development ofnew technologies or treatments, influence currentpolicymaking and future preparedness? \u0081 How is the scientific evidence (academic, public or commercial) being incorporated into policymaking? This report comes at a time of considerable investment by countries around the world in preparation for a potentialpandemic. In the UK, in response to the increasing spreadof avian influenza and in follow-up to its previous reportFighting Infection (House of Lords Science and Technology Committee 2003), the House of Lords Scienceand Technology Committee published the report of itsinquiry into the government's preparations to meet thethreat of pandemic influenza in December 2005 (Houseof Lords Science and Technology Committee 2006). Thereport called for the government to increase its supportfor international efforts to prevent an influenzapandemic, and to improve its coordination of domestic contingency planning. The government's response to the report was published in February 2006 (Department of Health 2006). This study by the Royal Society and theAcademy of Medical Sciences was initiated primarily toassess the use of scientific evidence in policymaking,relevant to preparing for a possible influenza pandemic. The call for evidence was met with 29 responses. Six oral evidence sessions took place between April and July2006 where views were taken from an additional 29individuals and organisations. A full list of contributorscan be found in Annex 2. In many cases their commentshave been reflected in the report and both academiesare grateful to the individuals and organisations thatprovided valuable input to this study. We hope this report will be of interest to policymakers and research funders, as well as to researchers and otherstakeholders. It has eight sections: \u0081 Section 1 provides a background to previous influenza pandemics, an introduction to avian andpandemic influenza, the current concerns abouttransfer of H5N1 avian influenza into humans andpreparedness for a pandemic. \u0081 Section 2 discusses avian influenza, covering viral reservoirs, the transmission and surveillance of disease,vaccines for avian influenza and facilities for research. \u0081 Section 3 gives an overview of the epidemiology and surveillance of influenza, both before andduring a pandemic. \u0081 Section 4 discusses antivirals - their use in the UK, stockpiling, delivery, resistance, and the need fornew antiviral agents. \u0081 Section 5 examines human vaccination including the use of seasonal influenza vaccines, current H5N1vaccines and the production of pandemic vaccines,and it identifies further research that is needed. \u0081 Section 6 examines the public health measures that are required during a pandemic. It covers theplanning and preparation needed, delivery in apandemic and post-pandemic evaluation. \u0081 Section 7 describes the use of science in policymaking, including the processes for obtainingscientific advice. It also discusses cross-governmentaland international coordination and communication. \u0081 Section 8 lists the report's recommendations. The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 31.2 Background Three pandemics occurred in the twentieth century, beginning in 1918, 1957 and 1968. In the 1918 'Spanishinfluenza' pandemic an estimated 40 million people diedworldwide. The subsequent pandemics of 1957 and1968 were similar in causing extensive morbidity butresulted in fewer deaths with estimates of two million inthe 1957 'Asian influenza' and one million in the 1968'Hong Kong influenza'. All three pandemics were caused by viruses that were related to avian influenza viruses. Avian populations,especially waterfowl, are hosts to large numbers ofinfluenza viruses which are distinguished primarily bydifferences in the haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase(N) glycoproteins that project from the virus haemagglutinin of haemagglutinin and neuraminidasesubtypes are found in birds, and in humans. The 1918pandemic virus was classified as H1N1, the 1957pandemic virus as H2N2 and the 1968 Hong Kong virus,which had the same neuraminidase as the 1957 virus, as H3N2. Currently H3N2, H1N1 and H1N2 are incirculation in humans. Since the mid-1990s viruses of the H5N1 subtype have become widespread in avian populations in South-EastAsia and have caused outbreaks of disease indomesticated poultry and in wild birds. In 1997 theseviruses were isolated from 18 cases of human influenza inHong Kong, six of which resulted in death. The source ofthe infection was traced to H5N1 influenza-infected birdsin the Hong Kong live poultry markets and extensiveculling in the markets prevented further human cases.However, two more fatalities were recorded in 2003 inHong Kong of visitors to South China. Since December2004 over 250 human cases of H5N1 avian influenzahave been treated globally with over 150 fatalities. The World Health Organization (WHO) now considers that the world is closer to another influenza pandemicthan at any time since 1968. There is general agreementin the scientific community that the risk of a humanpandemic is elevated because of the wide distribution ofH5N1 viruses, but there is a range of opinions about thelikelihood of a pandemic, primarily because the H5N1viruses have now been widely distributed for over adecade without the occurrence of a pandemic. There is also the possibility of a pandemic resulting frominfection with other avian influenza viruses, such asH9N2 avian viruses which have caused mild infections in humans in recent years in several countries in Asia. 1.3 Avian influenza Most influenza virus infections of wild birds areasymptomatic. However, during infections ofdomesticated poultry, some viruses that contain haemagglutinins of the H5 or H7 subtypes mutate tobecome highly infectious and highly pathogenic. Theinfections by these viruses are systemic rather thanrestricted to replication in the respiratory and enteric tractsand complete flocks often die within a day of infection. Although rare in the past, in recent years highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses appear to have spread fromdomesticated birds to waterfowl. Depending on theavian species, these infections can either cause severedisease or be asymptomatic. In either case, but especiallyin the latter, the infected birds serve as a reservoir forviruses that are potentially highly pathogenic, which maybe the source of their widespread distribution.Transmission by migratory birds may be involved in thisdistribution, for example by contamination of water byrespiratory and faecal excretions, but the importance ofmigrating birds in the spread of influenza viruses remainsto be ascertained. 1.3.1 Methods of control in poultry The implementation of strict sanitary and biosecurity measures and the restriction of movement of livepoultry, both within and between countries where thereare avian influenza outbreaks, are important controlmeasures. The logistics of these controls are most easilymet in commercial farms where birds are housed inlarge numbers, usually under strictly controlledconditions. Control is more difficult when poultry arekept in smaller flocks scattered throughout rural areasor on the periphery of urban areas. Vaccination ofpoultry is also used in some countries, particularly inSouth-East Asia and China (see section 2.3). 1.4 Pandemic influenza Influenza pandemics are caused by new influenzaviruses that have adapted to replicate and spreadefficiently in humans. Genetic analysis of the H2N2 and H3N2 viruses of the 1957 and 1968 pandemics has shown that they arose by genetic reassortmentbetween avian viruses and seasonal human viruses, in which genes for haemagglutinin and neuraminidaseglycoproteins were transferred from the avian viruses in the change from H1N1 to H2N2 influenza in 1957,and for the haemagglutinin gene in the change from H2N2 to H3N2 in 1968. In this way the virusesacquired genetic material from the circulating humanvirus that was adapted for growth in humans but thegenes for the glycoproteins that induce antibody-mediated immunity, the haemagglutinins, were from an avian virus. For H1N1 viruses of the 1918 pandemic a similar process may have occurred or anH1N1 avian virus may have infected humans directlywithout reassortment. In addition to geneticreassortment, mutation of the H2 and H3 avianhaemagglutinins was required to allow the viruses to The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 4| November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policyThe Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 5bind to human cell receptors rather than to the chemically distinct avian cell receptors that the virusesuse to infect birds. For H1 viruses the samehaemagglutinin mutations were not required forhuman-to-human spread. The continued spread of H5N1 viruses in birds increases the opportunities for direct infection of people in contactwith them and as a consequence for the selection ofmutant viruses that are able to recognise human cellreceptors efficiently. Similarly, the more frequentlyhumans are infected with H5N1 viruses the greater thepossibility of mixed infections with the current seasonalinfluenza viruses where genetic reassortment could occurto generate H5N1 viruses that contain genes adapted forgrowth in humans. 1.4.1 Clinical featuresAs an emerging disease, H5N1 influenza in humans is poorly understood, and a lack of autopsy data to datehas been a limiting factor in understanding more aboutthe disease progression. However, in most patients, thedisease caused by the avian H5N1 virus follows anunusually aggressive clinical course, with rapiddeterioration and high fatality. Current data for H5N1 infection indicate an incubation period ranging fromtwo to eight days and possibly as long as 17 days. Arecent study of patients infected with H5N1 indicatesthat the presence of high levels of the virus and theresulting intense inflammatory responses are central tothe development of the disease (de Jong et al 2006).Initial symptoms include a high fever and diarrhoea.Vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain, and bleedingfrom the nose and gums have also been reported asearly symptoms. Almost all patients developedpneumonia that did not respond to treatment withantibiotics. In patients infected with the H5N1 virus,clinical deterioration is rapid. In severe cases, respiratoryfailure occurs three to five days after symptom onset.Since 2003, over 50% of those people who have beentreated for infection with the avian H5N1 strain havedied. It is not known if there have been otherunreported cases of less severe disease. In sections 4 and 5 we discuss the use of antiviral drugs that block the replication of the virus in a number ofdifferent ways, to treat H5N1 and the potentialdevelopment of vaccines. Box 1 UK influenza pandemic contingency plan The most recent UK Health Departments' influenza pandemic contingency plan was published in October 2005 (UK Health Departments 2005). It is currently under revision and is expected to be republished in spring 2007.This document provides the overall framework for the UK's response in the event of a pandemic, which will beled by the Department of Health. It sets out the work that is required before a potential pandemic emergesfollowed by a step-wise escalating response as a pandemic evolves. A summary of the plan is given below: \u0081 The contingency plan is based on assumptions derived from current evidence, previous pandemics, expert opinion and mathematical modelling. The assumptions concentrate on the 'most likely' scenario in terms of the origins of a pandemic, its timing, geographical spread and infectivity, the extent and severity of illnessand the number of deaths. For example, the plans consider the base scenario to be a cumulative clinicalattack rate of between 10% and 50% of the population over 15 weeks, with a likely fatality rate of between 0.37% and 2.50% of those infected. The value used for planning purposes is that one in fourpeople will be infected (a clinical attack rate of 25%) with a 0.37% fatality rate. \u0081 It estimates the impact this fatality rate would have on health and social services, GP consultations and hospital admissions. \u0081 It sets out the extent to which interventions such as antiviral drugs and vaccination might ameliorate the impact of a pandemic and puts forward potential strategies for how they could be deployed in the event of a pandemic. \u0081 It sets out in detail the roles and responsibilities of the main organisations at each phase or wave of an influenza pandemic situation. These are identified as the Department of Health, which will direct andcoordinate the UK health response, the UK National Influenza Pandemic Committee (UKNIPC), the CivilContingencies Committee, other government departments, the Devolved Administrations, the HealthProtection Agency (HPA), the National Health Service and various other organisations at a local level.Organisations such as the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Medical Research Council National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), the National Institute for BiologicalStandards and Control (NIBSC) and the National Influenza Reference Centres also have a role in the response.1.4.2 Pandemic preparedness Most estimates of the impact of a future pandemic are based on extrapolations from previous pandemics.However, the modern world is very different, particularly from 1918. Since then there have beenconsiderable improvements in nutrition, health care,international travel (particularly air travel) andopportunities for interventions. WHO has set outguidelines and recommendations to help individualcountries develop their own pandemic preparednessplans (World Health Organization 2005). In accordancewith WHO guidelines, the UK government hasdeveloped its own plan (see box 1) to support itsresponse to a pandemic, setting out specific measuresand actions required from health and other government departments and organisations at national and local levels. 1.5 Joint Royal Society and Academy of Medical Sciences study This study was initiated to review current scientific knowledge of influenza viruses and has examined theextent to which scientific evidence has been used as abasis for preparedness for a pandemic. It has identifiedareas where additional evidence could be used in policydevelopment and contingency planning and makesrecommendations to policymakers. The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 6| November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policyThe Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 7A number of strains of avian influenza are always in circulation around the world of which H5, H7 and H9currently are known to infect humans. To reduce thethreat of pandemic influenza in humans the currentH5N1 outbreaks in bird species need to be controlled. The current H5N1 virus is of special significance as:\u0081 it is unusual for highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses to be so widespread and to be found in wild bird populations and the spread from poultryto wild birds is unprecedented; \u0081 the mortality rate in humans of 50% of those treated is a major concern for public health; if the virus attains human-to-human transmissibility and retains this level of virulence in humans then the impact of an H5N1 pandemicwould be catastrophic. Wild waterfowl and gulls are a natural reservoir for influenza viruses but their current role in the spread ofH5N1 is not fully understood. Within domestic poultrypopulations low pathogenicity avian influenza can oftencirculate undetected. Highly pathogenic avian influenzainfections are much more dramatic and are usuallydetected quickly within a flock. It has, however, beenobserved that previous infections with H9N2 may maskthe disease signs of H5N1 infection as a result of cross-reactive immunity or through the production of the anti-viral protein interferon (Seo et al 2002). The focus for the control of avian influenza virus infection is likely to be in domesticated species sincethey are in closer contact with humans while beingfarmed and when processed in the food chain.Moreover, it is more feasible that enhancedmanagement practices with increased awareness ofdisease security can be implemented to control infectionand ultimately eliminate it. The tools to control avianinfluenza in poultry will include vaccination andsurveillance. Both will be demanding. Where anoutbreak occurs in domestic poultry culling is the mosteffective disease control method. 2.1 Avian reservoirs and transmission The major reservoir of avian influenza viruses is the Anseriformes (ducks, geese and swans). Typically,these host species harbour low pathogenicity avianinfluenza viruses but two subtypes of low pathogenicityavian influenza, H5 and H7, can rapidly evolve intohighly pathogenic avian influenza upon transfer to chickens and other Galliformes such as turkeys and quails.The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus emerged as a disease problem in domestic fowl in southern China in 1997and again in 2003. The 2003 H5N1 outbreak rapidlyspread to domestic fowl in countries in South-East Asiaincluding Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam probably as a result of commercial trading. H5N1 has also spread towildfowl, which has led to wide geographical dispersalas a result of bird migration. There is only limited understanding of the factors influencing transmission of influenza viruses withinspecies and between species. This knowledge is neededto assess the risk of spread of viruses in the field fromdomesticated or wild birds. Investigations are requiredinto the parameters of virus host range within birdspecies. These studies are likely to include investigationsof cross-species transmission between infected ducks,geese and poultry and of the characteristics of viruses as they are transmitted between species. In thisconnection, current H5N1 viruses have caused fatalsystemic infections of tigers, leopards and domestic cats.Infections of cats will need to be considered in theepidemiology of H5N1. 2.2 Avian influenza surveillance The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) hasresponsibility for coordinating and setting guidelines for global surveillance of avian influenza, principally indomestic poultry, for collating and publishing globalsurveillance data and for defining procedures for thecontrol of avian influenza outbreaks. In general,standards for animal health are more tightly regulatedglobally than are those for human health, with OIEhaving a statutory responsibility for animal health underWorld Trade Organization (WTO) rules. This means, forWTO members at least, OIE regulations have somethingclose to the force of law (albeit mediated by national or supranational bodies, such as the EuropeanCommission). Surveillance of wild bird populations ismandated by a recently adopted European Directive(2005/94/EC). Under OIE rules, it is compulsory for member states to report all outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenzain domesticated or wild birds. To confirm an outbreak,virus detection and genotyping must be undertaken by an OIE reference laboratory (eg the VeterinaryLaboratories Agency (VLA), Weybridge). However, notall countries have provided viral samples in practice, andcertainly not for every outbreak. From the evidence wereceived, concerns exist about the availability andsharing of avian influenza virus isolates and related data- particularly in relation to H5N1. These are discussed ingreater detail in section 3.2.1.2 Avian influenzaThe Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 8| November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policyOutbreaks, particularly in wildfowl, may not always be obvious in countries with poor surveillance and fewkeen volunteer ornithologists. The infrastructure foranimal disease surveillance is completely lacking in manycountries, to the extent that the first signal that H5N1has reached several areas of the world has been thedetection of human cases. Surveillance data are oftenlimited, with only the number of 'outbreaks' per regionreported. Definitions of an outbreak may also differbetween countries and may be reported as a singleinfected farm, an affected village, or even an affectedprovince. Innovative methods for improving surveillance of avian influenza and other zoonoticdiseases in areas lacking animal diseasesurveillance infrastructure should be developed.We recommend that OIE and FAO considerdeveloping sentinel networks of farmers orvillages in these regions for outbreak reporting(Recommendation 1 (R1)). Wild migratory birds have a potential role in the international spread of H5N1 and measures need to be in place to minimise the transfer from wildfowl to domestic birds and humans. To date, H5N1 has not spread among wildfowl in the UK, the dead swanfound in Celladyke in April 2006 being an exception of uncertain provenance. However, given that the virushas spread out of East Asia to Western Asia, EasternEurope, the Baltic coast and West Africa, it is probablyonly a question of time before it reaches the UK.Studies to increase knowledge of the role of wildbirds in the spread of infection should beexpanded both nationally and internationally andinvolve collection of data and collaboration ofmajor international agencies specifically for thispurpose. In the UK these bodies would include theDepartment for Environment, Food and RuralAffairs (Defra), VLA, ornithological charities andthe HPA (R2). A European Research Network for Early Warning of Influenza Viruses in Migratory Birds inEurope (NEW_FLUBIRD) has been established in whichthe VLA and the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust UK areparticipants. The surveillance and collection of samples from wildfowl are labour intensive andwe recommend that participants in thesurveillance networks should receive adequatefunding from Defra and the European Commissionto continue to operate efficiently in the UK,Europe and globally (R3). In most circumstances highly pathogenic avian influenza infections are plainly evident due to the suddenmortality observed in domestic poultry. This has notalways been the case for H5N1 infection and it may belinked to the presence of other avian influenza virusinfections (such as H9N2) in poultry populations,particularly in the non-intensively reared sector.Surveillance needs to be carried out for infection ofdomesticated species with avian influenza viruses of all subtypes. Research should be done to ensure thatsurveillance is effective, virus detection is sensitive, and a wide range of avian species is examined and accuratelyidentified. It is important to ensure that modernmolecular methods for virus detection are not allowedto displace traditional virus isolation since completeanalysis of the viruses depends on their isolation. Thenew methods should complement traditional virology.We recommend that research should be done byDefra and the Biotechnology and BiologicalSciences Research Council (BBSRC) to ensure thatprocedures for avian influenza virus collection arerobust, that the subsequent transport of samples issecure, and that methods used for virus isolationand characterisation are the most appropriate andup-to-date (R4). The transmission of an avian virus to humans is more likely to occur from domestic fowl than from wildfowlbecause of increased frequency of contact, althoughtransmission from wildfowl is not implausible. It is unlikelythat a pandemic caused by the H5N1 virus will first arisein the UK because there is limited contact betweenhumans and domestic poultry. All countries harbouringH5N1 in birds need to have active surveillance of bird-to-human transfer and of human-to-human adaptation ofthe virus. Surveillance systems to detect the emergence of a pandemic are discussed in section 3.2. 2.3 Avian influenza vaccines Domestic and commercial birds are not routinelyvaccinated against avian influenza in most countries.During the current H5N1 avian influenza outbreak,some affected countries are attempting to eradicate thevirus from their domestic and commercial flocks byvaccination as well as by culling (eg China andVietnam). Other countries, for example Hong Kong andThailand have employed culling exclusively. Although it is clearly not possible to remove the H5N1 virus from the many species of wild birds that now carryit, often without signs of infection (see section 2.1), anextensive domestic bird vaccination policy in countriessuch as China and Vietnam may reduce the risk oftransmission of the virus between birds, and possibly asa consequence to humans. Although difficult to assess,the absence of cases of H5N1 human infections inVietnam since August 2005 may be a result of itsvaccination policy and public education about high riskpractices, such as handling sick chickens. Within Europe,the Netherlands and Italy are the only countries to haveinitiated an avian influenza vaccination programme. The UK's policy is that poultry will not be vaccinated in advance of an outbreak of avian influenza. The DeputyChief Veterinary Officer explained in his evidence to thisstudy that this is because of the well-documentedlimitations of the vaccines currently available(Department for Environment, Food and Rural AffairsThe Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 92005). Defra believe that the most effective means of protection are the maintenance of a high standard ofbiosecurity; separating poultry from wild birds; andcareful surveillance for signs of disease. It was suggested to us that vaccination might be employed if avian influenza became endemic in the wild birdpopulation at a level so high that there was frequent'spillover' into the domestic poultry population. InSeptember 2006 Defra placed an order for ten milliondoses of avian influenza vaccine for potential use inpoultry and other captive birds in the UK. This vaccinecould be used against both H5 and H7 viruses. This is in addition to the 2.3 million doses of vaccine Defrabought earlier in 2006 for a possible preventivevaccination of zoo birds. Defra does not have a specific committee to advise on developments in vaccines and new technologies for thecontrol of avian influenza and other animal diseases,though some advice on vaccines comes through theVLA. The processes for evaluating the evidence used toprocure avian influenza vaccines are unclear, as is theway in which scientific advice is incorporated intodecision making. The establishment of an animalvaccination advisory committee by Defra to includeindependent experts would ensure an evidence-basedapproach. We recommend that Defra should set up a vaccination committee, similar to theDepartment of Health's Joint Committee onVaccination and Immunisation. This committeeshould advise the department on the developmentof its vaccination strategies across all animaldiseases, including avian influenza (R5). Research into the efficacy of vaccination of domesticated species against avian influenza is a highpriority. Laboratory studies need to be undertaken toquantify the levels at which vaccinated birds shedviruses, following not only from optimal vaccinationpractices but also following suboptimal vaccination. Thepossibility of selecting virus variants by vaccine selection,either immune escape mutants or viruses with increasedvirulence, needs to be assessed. These studies willrequire detailed analysis of viruses that may be shedfrom vaccinated and challenged birds. Priorities forresearch on existing vaccines include: \u0081 detailed analysis of the virus-shedding trajectory;\u0081 the duration and level of virus-shedding following challenge of vaccinated birds; \u0081 the effect of suboptimal vaccination on protection and virus-shedding; \u0081 detailed characterisation of virus shed from vaccinated birds following challenge, to check forthe appearance of antigenic variants and; \u0081 the effects of age, breed and other factors that may influence vaccine efficacy. New approaches to developing avian influenza vaccines are needed. These could include the use of new adjuvants (compounds which increase theefficacy of vaccines when given at the same time) and the development of new vaccine vectors such as the recently developed Newcastle Disease Virus, which expresses the influenza virus haemagglutinin.Other possibilities include the use of geneticallyengineered Marek's Disease virus vaccine, or infectiousbronchitis virus vaccine that can be used at an early age or for in ovo vaccination. Each new approach will need detailed study for efficacy and any vaccine-induced selection of virus variants. We recommend that as part of their current calls forproposals, research funders, in collaboration withDefra and the vaccine industry, should solicitproposals from the research community to addressthese research priorities for avian influenzavaccines (R6). 2.4 Avian immunology Although studies undertaken in domesticated birds have contributed considerably to our knowledge ofavian immunology generally, advances in ourunderstanding of the host response to influenza virusinfection are limited. There is very little understanding of the cellular immunology of poultry. Research needs to address: \u0081 how host genetics influence the production of neutralising antibody and protection in response toinfection or vaccination; \u0081 the location and nature of virus-specific immune responses to both low pathogenicity and highpathogenicity avian influenza viruses; \u0081 whether protection of poultry from lethal H5N1 infections occurs as a result of previous infection byanother avian influenza virus, for example H9N2,and how disease signs might be suppressed; \u0081 the application to avian influenza infections of the techniques for studying the immune system ofchickens as they develop.The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 10 | November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policy2.5 Facilities and research High-quality scientific research and surveillance are being funded by Defra within the remit of the VLA, but we remain concerned that wider research tounderstand more about avian influenza is not beingsupported. We recommend that Defra, in collaboration with the BBSRC and the Medical Research Council (MRC), examines areaswhere further research could be funded such asbasic avian influenza research and avianimmunology (R7). Work in the UK with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses is required to be done in high-containmentlaboratories and animal houses to ensure that viruses are not released from the laboratories. There are six laboratories in the UK equipped to work with highlypathogenic avian influenza which in some cases areageing and require significant improvement work. Thoseorganisations with suitable animal facilities for handlinghighly pathogenic avian influenza-infected poultry andbirds are the Institute of Animal Health (IAH) Comptonand VLA Weybridge. It is anticipated that the merger ofthe VLA Weybridge and IAH facilities for avian influenzaresearch will result in an overall loss of facilities for workwith highly pathogenic avian influenza. It is essentialthat the option to expand these facilities should beinvestigated further. We recommend that the government should provide increased funding toexpand high containment facilities to enable vitalresearch in this field (R8).3.1 Introduction This section focuses on the epidemiology and surveillance of human disease before and during |an influenza pandemic. It considers some of the issues concerning sharing of data and aspects ofepidemiology and mathematical modelling. Surveillancefor avian influenza is discussed in section 2. 3.2 Human pre-pandemic surveillance WHO has responsibility for coordinating globalinfluenza surveillance, determining pandemic alertlevels (and hence 'declaring' a pandemic), settinginternational recommendations for surveillance andpandemic preparedness, and investigating andresponding to clusters of disease. The scientists that we took evidence from believe that the existing WHO-coordinated system of surveillanceworks well. The WHO Global Influenza SurveillanceNetwork was established in 1952 and its activities haveprogressively expanded in relation to internationalcoverage and the antigenic and geneticcharacterisation of viruses. The quality and breadth ofthe surveillance are essential aspects of the annualrecommendations provided by WHO on thecomposition of influenza vaccines for use in thenorthern and southern hemispheres (see section 5.2). Globally, WHO coordinates influenza surveillance through the four WHO Collaborating Centres (inAtlanta, London, Tokyo and Melbourne), which providestate-of-the-art strain-typing and genotyping facilitiesand expertise to WHO centrally and to NationalInfluenza Centres. The first WHO Centre (the WorldInfluenza Centre) was established under the auspices ofthe MRC at the NIMR in London, and the UK hasplayed a major role in the scientific and technicaldevelopment of the international surveillance system. At a country level, there are 112 WHO-recognised National Influenza Centres in 83 countries thatcoordinate national surveillance. These centres varydramatically in capabilities. In addition, in 2000 WHOestablished a more general emerging infectionsurveillance network: the Global Outbreak Alert andResponse Network (GOARN) (World HealthOrganization 2000). The input of information toGOARN mainly comes from the Global Public HealthIntelligence Network (GPHIN), which is a largelyautomated information-gathering tool that searchesthe World Wide Web for reports of unexplained diseaseclusters. GPHIN is thought to have provided the firstinternational early warning of the 2003 outbreak ofSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), by highlighting reports of a cluster of severe respiratoryinfection in southern China (World Health Organization 2003). In contrast to the situation in birds (see section 2.2), there is no legal requirement on member states ofWHO to report avian influenza infections in humans,though this is expected to change under theInternational Health Regulations adopted in May 2005and scheduled to enter into force in June 2007 (WorldHealth Organization 2005b). However, internationalpressure means that most member states report casesthey detect, though not always as promptly as wouldbe desirable. The quality of surveillance for human infections with H5N1 is highly variable and, although many countriesin South-East Asia have made efforts to improvesurveillance, other regions have almost non-existentsurveillance infrastructures (eg most of sub-SaharanAfrica). When a suspected human H5N1 case isdetected, local teams, often with invited WHO support,investigate the case and look for contacts and evidenceof a larger-case cluster. Where possible, viral samplesare taken and sequenced, though not all countriespermit export of samples. In newly affected areas, viralsamples are not always immediately available and oftenthose infected have died and funerals have beenconducted without samples being taken. Where a cluster of cases is detected in a single location at a single time, investigations have greater urgency asevidence for human-to-human transmission is sought.In such circumstances, the WHO Pandemic Influenzadraft protocol for Rapid Response and Containment(World Health Organization 2006) can be invoked, with use of targeted antiviral prophylaxis, contacttracing, quarantine and other social distance measuressuch as school closures, household quarantine andtravel restrictions intended to reduce contacts in the community. Modern genetic sequencing methods allow rapid diagnosis in index cases of influenza virus strains andvariants. Thus in January 2006, within 48 hours ofreceiving samples from suspected human cases inTurkey, the WHO Collaborating Influenza ReferenceCentre in London was able to issue the full genomesequence of the virus and to identify a mutationpotentially affecting binding to human sialic acidreceptors in one of the patients. There should, however, be no complacency about the WHO influenza surveillance system. Despite theadvances outlined above, there remain many 3 Epidemiology and surveillance The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 11The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 12 | November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policyunderdeveloped areas of the world where it is perhaps unlikely that human-to-human transmission of H5 infection would be identified early enough to contain the outbreak. It is important that nationalauthorities work closely with WHO to increase theeffectiveness of the system, including its globalcoverage and its scientific and technical capacity. We recommend that European Union (EU) member states, including the UK, should workclosely with WHO to support scientific researchrelevant to the quality and value of influenzasurveillance and research to improve theunderstanding of the epidemiology of influenza (R9). Whether or not the current avian H5N1 virus causes a pandemic in the near future, surveillance anddiagnostic systems put in place now should provide animportant basis for the future monitoring of a range ofinfectious diseases, in addition to avian influenza. It isessential that the increased capacity within the UKshould be able to be applied to other infectious andzoonotic diseases wherever possible. The Department of Health and Defra, in collaboration with WHOand the scientific and medical communities, shouldreview the potential applications of the datacollected in infectious disease surveillancegenerally (R10). 3.2.1 Data sharingAs highlighted in section 2.2, the working group heard concerns that there are problems with the availabilityand sharing of both human and avian influenza virusisolates and other scientific data, particularly in relationto H5N1. Greater sharing of data would accelerateresearch on the virus. We recommend that genetic, antigenic and pathogenic data relating to newavian viruses, especially H5, H7 and H9 subtypes,should be made widely and rapidly available. Inparticular, samples of virus isolates should bemade available as a matter of urgency to bonafide laboratories for research and developmentpurposes (R11). In a letter to Nature, 70 scientists proposed the creation of a Global Initiative on Sharing AvianInfluenza Data that would promote the sharing of data via public databases within six months of it being analysed and validated (Bognor et al 2006).Such sharing of virus strains is an essential aspect of international collaboration and pandemicpreparedness. We recommend that the UK government supports the Global Initiative onSharing Avian Influenza Data and ensures thatgovernment and publicly funded laboratories putin place plans to publish all surveillance data (R12).3.3 Surveillance during a pandemic In the UK, the Department of Health and the HPA are currently planning real-time surveillance systems for use during a pandemic. There will inevitably beconstraints on what data it is possible to captureduring a pandemic, owing to the extreme demand for healthcare services. The priority is therefore tocollect data that will inform decision makers on theprogress of the epidemic (eg its rate of growth andwhether it has peaked), the burden on the healthcaresystem (including the availability and usage of antiviraldrugs and vaccines), mortality, and the effectiveness of the interventions in place. Real-time surveillance will integrate data from: sentinel surveillance of disease reported to General Practitioners (GPs); thedisease-reporting and drug distribution system put in place to deliver antivirals to the population in apandemic (see section 4.6); hospital patient recordsand death registrations. In the earliest stages of a pandemic there will be an urgent need to collect very detailed information on the first few hundred cases arising in the UK, in order to enable age-specific mortality rates to be estimated and the risk factors for severe morbidityto be characterised. Such data may also allow key epidemiological parameters to be determined - inparticular the reproduction number and the doublingtime of the epidemic. These estimates will be important for updating epidemic models and therebypredictions of the speed of spread and impact of thepandemic in the UK. Clinical data on the first fewhundred cases are also likely to be critically importantfor informing best clinical practice in treating cases; for example in determining whether antiviral drugdosing levels or schedules need adjustment for theparticular strain of virus encountered. It would also be beneficial if detailed case data were available on the first cases in the source country or inother countries affected before the UK. Rather thanwaiting for data to be collected in the UK, this wouldallow earlier refinement of the UK pandemic plan andclinical treatment protocols. However, the availability of such data cannot be currently relied upon. In the UK, the HPA will have the primary role in analysing real-time surveillance data and providingreports to the Department of Health and thegovernment's emergency response committee COBR.The membership of COBR depends on the nature ofthe issue and it, and the HPA, will be supplemented by external epidemiological experts as needed. Internationally, it is much less clear-cut what data will be available once the pandemic has really become established. Many western countries (eg the US, France and Germany) have plans to collect similar data to theUK, but in many cases these are not currently asdeveloped as the UK's. In the less developed world,systematic surveillance is likely to be patchy or non-existent. In many countries, the only data that are likelyto be available are the absence or presence of infectionin a region. We recommend that the UK government should lead efforts to coordinateplans for real-time data collection and data sharingduring a pandemic, at the EU, EU and G8, andWHO/UN level. Achieving consistency of thedetailed data collected on the first few hundredcases in each country and the summary datacollected thereafter could offer significant benefitsto collaborating countries prepared to share datain real time, since the data collected in a countryaffected early could aid final preparednessplanning in countries not yet affected (R13). 3.4 Epidemiological analysis and modelling Epidemiological analysis consists of much more thanjust epidemic modelling. The statistical analysis of casedata from unexplained clusters of H5N1-like orinfluenza-like respiratory disease will, in combinationwith detailed epidemiological investigation on theground, play a key role in determining whether a newvirus has emerged that is capable of being transmittedfrom person-to-person at a rate capable of causing aself-sustaining epidemic. Mathematical modelling has a key role in pandemic planning by giving quantitative estimates of the likelypattern and speed of spread of a pandemic and thepossible impact of different interventions, such asantiviral treatment and prophylaxis (see section 4),vaccination (see section 5), school closure, other 'social distancing' and travel restrictions. Models are only as reliable as the estimates of the biological and epidemiological parameters they require. In the case of pandemic influenza, although it is possible to use data from past pandemics toconstrain some important parameters (such as thetransmissibility of a new pandemic influenza virus),many uncertainties remain. This is in part owing to themany societal changes that have occurred since the lastpandemic in 1968 (eg much greater internationaltravel, reductions in household sizes), and in partbecause H5N1 infections in humans have very differentclinical characteristics from past pandemic viruses orseasonal influenza. In particular it is not possible to give meaningful predictions of the likely mortality that will result fromfuture pandemics, given that H5N1 has a much higherhuman lethality than any previous influenza virus seen(currently greater than 50% of those treated).Furthermore there is a complete lack of scientific knowledge about whether the current avian viruswould be likely to become less lethal if it becametransmissible from person-to-person. It is not evenpossible to estimate a meaningful upper bound onlethality. The Department of Health's use of 0.37% and 2.50% case mortality scenarios for planning issolely based on mortality seen in the 1957 and 1918 pandemics. A further uncertainty concerns the likely impact on transmission of non-pharmaceutical interventions (see section 6.2.2) such as mass use of personalprotective equipment (ie masks) or social distancingmeasures. In theory such measures might be highlyeffective at reducing transmission if rigorously andcorrectly applied, but the reality, given imperfectadherence to policy recommendations by affectedindividuals and communities, is likely to be muchdifferent. Unfortunately, almost no population datacurrently exist to quantify the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions, as highlighted by arecent WHO working group paper (World HealthOrganization Writing Group 2006). In addition, modelling to date has not incorporated the possible impact of spontaneous reductions inpopulation contact rates in the face of a lethalpandemic. It is not known how the public would react;for example, changes in the population's behaviourwere observed in Singapore and Hong Kong during the 2003 SARS outbreak. Again, no quantitative dataon the likely impact of such measures on transmissioncurrently exist. This is discussed in greater detail insection 6.3.3. Additional epidemiological studies are needed to analyse existing disease and socialdata to estimate the likely impact of socialdistancing measures (especially school closure) ona future pandemic and to examine the evidencefor population behavioural changes in a pandemicthat might affect disease transmission (R14). Current modelling should therefore be best viewed as exploring the range of feasible future pandemicscenarios, rather than providing detailed predictions.The UK has been traditionally strong in developing the field of epidemic modelling generally, though notuntil recently in modelling influenza epidemics andpandemics. Expertise in modelling human influenza is largely restricted to two centres in the UK: the HPAand Imperial College London. Both these groups havebeen advising the Department of Health since 2005 on pandemic planning. The modelling results from the two groups, although not identical, have hadsufficient consistency to enable broad conclusions to be drawn about the relative effectiveness of differentcontrol measures to be drawn. During a pandemic, epidemiological analysis and modelling will play a key role in interpreting real-time The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 13The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 14 | November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policydata. Outputs derived from detailed data collected on the first few hundred cases will include estimation ofthe case mortality ratio, transmissibility, the agedistribution of morbidity and mortality and the impactof interventions (treatment, prophylaxis, vaccination,isolation, social distancing measures). Later in theepidemic, modelling will provide predictions ofepidemic trends; eg time to the peak of the epidemic,peak clinical attack rate, likely cumulative attack rate,healthcare burden through time, and likelyabsenteeism. These estimates will be crucial forstrategic and operational decision making in themanagement of a pandemic. The HPA has the primaryrole in providing the UK government with the results ofepidemiological modelling and analysis during a pandemic, working closely with key academic research groups with expertise in this area. Internationally, many more groups in the US and other EU states have expertise in influenza modelling, withseveral being actively involved in advising their nationalgovernments and more widely. There are informalnetworks between subsets of these researchers, but nooverall structure within which to collate results,compare approaches or present analyses topolicymakers in a consistent manner. It would beadvantageous if long-term mechanisms were put inplace for enhancing international coordination ofepidemiological modelling and analysis, especiallywhere modelling is directly influencing policymaking.The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 154.1 Introduction Antiviral drugs have been developed for the treatment of a number of viral infections. In the case of influenza,antiviral drugs are available that differ in their mode ofaction, side effects, routes of administration, dosagesand costs. Treatment with antiviral drugs is expected toshorten the duration of the disease, alleviate symptomsand reduce complications and serious illness. 4.2 Existing antivirals One of the major developments that has influencedpreparations for future influenza pandemics is theavailability of two groups of licensed anti-influenzadrugs. One of the groups, the amantadine-relatedcompounds (M2 inhibitors), was discovered in the1960s to block virus production in cell cultures and inanimals. These drugs, such as Symetrel, target the virusmembrane proton channel, M2, and by blocking thechannel inhibit replication of the virus. Drugs of thesecond group, neuraminidase inhibitors, includeoseltamivir (Tamiflu) and the membrane neuraminidases,which remove sialic acid from virus and cellularglycoproteins during infection. This activity is essentialbecause influenza viruses use cell surface sialic acids asreceptors and if neuraminidase activity is blocked, newlyproduced viruses bind to the infected cell surfaces andare not released to spread the infection. Theseobservations prompted the search, beginning in the1960s, for small molecule inhibitors, which was furtherstimulated by determination of the three-dimensionalstructure of the neuraminidase molecule by X-raycrystallography in 1983 (Varghese et al 1983). 4.3 Antiviral use and resistance Experience of the use of amantadine-related M2 drugshas shown that they can cause neurological side effectsand that they readily select transmissible-resistantviruses; for example, many of the H3N2 influenzaviruses isolated in the US since 2004 are resistant. Theneuraminidase inhibitor drugs oseltamivir and zanamivirare well tolerated, although oseltamivir occasionallycauses nausea. In clinical trials of either drug fewresistant viruses were recovered. In cell culture,resistance has been observed to result from mutationsnot only in the neuraminidase but also in amantadine-resistant are frequently unstable and their enzyme activity and infectivity are compromised (McKimm-Breschkin 2000). There have been limited observations to date on the use of oseltamivir in humans infected with H5N1. However,the use of oseltamivir in one study to treat H5N1infections in Vietnam resulted in the isolation of resistantviruses from two out of eight patients, both of whom died(de Jong et al 2005). Additional studies of the productionof resistant mutants during seasonal H3N2 influenza inJapan concluded that 18% of the viruses isolated from agroup of children treated with oseltamivir containedmutant neuraminidases (Kiso et al 2004). Theseobservations highlight the possibility that extensive use ofneuraminidase inhibitors could generate large numbers ofresistant viruses and therefore severely caution againstdependence on one anti-influenza drug for use in apandemic. They will also re-stimulate the search forcompounds that block influenza virus replication bytargeting, in addition to the neuraminidase and the M2proton channel, other essential virus processes such asRNA polymerase activity and haemagglutinin sialic acidreceptor binding. The use of additional drugs incombination with both anti-neuraminidase and anti-M2compounds could be invaluable. 4.4 The use of antivirals in the UK In the UK, three antiviral agents - oseltamivir, zanamivirand amantadine - are currently licensed for thetreatment of all strains of influenza: two of these,oseltamivir and amantadine, are also licensed forprophylaxis. Although antivirals are licensed for thetreatment of seasonal influenza in the UK, the currentguidelines from the National Institute of Health andClinical Excellence recommend vaccination as the firstline of protection (see section 5). In the UK, antivirals are recommended for treating influenza-like illness only in those considered to be atrisk of developing complications from infection andproviding treatment can commence within 48 hours ofsymptoms starting. Use of antivirals in the UK hastherefore been limited since their launch in 1999. Mostexperience of the use of antivirals for treatment ofseasonal influenza comes from Japan, where oseltamiviris used regularly. In an influenza pandemic in the UK, the current intention is to use oseltamivir for treatment of caseswith clinical symptoms of influenza infection (see box1). Prophylactic use on a large scale is not currentlyenvisaged by the Department of Health.4 Antivirals4.5 Antiviral stockpiling As a result of the problems with amantadine resistance and the fact that the current H5N1 viruses aresusceptible to neuraminidase inhibitors, WHO andnational governments have focused on stockpilingneuraminidase inhibitors, in particular oseltamivir, whichis manufactured by Roche. The demand for antivirals forstockpiling has been substantial since the recentoutbreaks of H5N1. However, both oseltamivir andzanamivir have a sufficiently complicated and longproduction process to limit their availability. To date,over 70 governments have sought contracts forcontingency stocks, with 400 million courses ofoseltamivir being supplied around the world by the end of 2006. The UK government placed an order for 14.6 million courses of oseltamivir in March 2005, to coverapproximately 25% of the population. This order wascompleted in September 2006. The selection of thisparticular drug was largely on the basis of its tabletformulation and its commercial availability. The stockpileis being held at several locations around the country,though not in hospitals. No advice appears to have beensought from the HPA, the manufacturers or otherexternal experts regarding the size of stockpile that wasordered. Key questions exist about whether a 25% stockpile will be sufficient to treat all clinical cases in a pandemic and,indeed, whether the actual pandemic virus will besusceptible to the drugs. In its evidence, the Departmentof Health told us that the strategy around thestockpiling and use of antivirals remains constantlyunder review and it is looking at the practicalities, risk,benefits and costs of extending the stockpile ofantivirals beyond 25% of the population. In addition to oseltamivir many countries have placed smaller orders for zanamivir. However, the Departmentof Health has not to date placed an order for zanamivir,although it has held discussions with its manufacturer,GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Observations that oseltamivirresistance occurs in H5N1 viruses that retain sensitivityto zanamivir suggest that both drugs should be in theUK's stockpile. There are indications that higher doses ofoseltamivir will be necessary for successful treatment ofH5N1, and therefore a larger stockpile may be requiredof both oseltamivir and zanamivir (see section 4.7). Thestockpile needs to be large enough to cope withmultiple waves of a pandemic because the intervalbetween waves may not be long enough tomanufacture and purchase more antivirals. We recommend that the Department of Healthcontinues to review the size of the currentstockpile of oseltamivir and as a matter of urgencyrevisits the decision not to stockpile zanamivir at the same level for use especially where resistance to oseltamivir is suspected (R15). An additional factor influencing the size of the stockpile that will be required is the preferential prescription ofthe drugs for healthcare or other essential workers as aprophylactic, as well as the choice generally betweenprophylaxis following exposure and therapy followinginfection. Such decisions will depend on observations onthe effectiveness of treatments during initial outbreaks.The Department of Health stated in its evidence that thepossibility of adding household prophylaxis to thecurrent treatment strategy is under review. 4.6 Methods of delivery The majority of the UK's stockpile of oseltamivir issupplied as packs of ten 75mg capsules. It is also availableas the active pharmaceutical ingredient, supplied in bulk,which can be reconstituted as an oral suspension withbenzoic acid and water. This oral suspension will be usedat a dose based on weight for children under five years ofage, who are too young to take the drug in capsule form.Roche is conducting research to examine alternativeformulations of oseltamivir such as intravenousadministration for individuals who are unable to takeoseltamivir in capsule form. Zanamivir is inhaled by mouth using a delivery device called a Diskhaler \u00aewhich has limited its use in seasonal influenza. GSK is currently examining the feasibility ofdeveloping an intravenous formulation of zanamivir, andis in discussion with the regulators. The availability of anintravenous formulation of antiviral medication forunconscious patients in an intensive care setting wouldbe an important development. It is important that an effective disease reporting and drug delivery system is put in place to ensure that sickindividuals get antivirals within 24 hours of the onset ofsymptoms, and thus gain the best possible clinicalbenefit from the drug. The current proposed method ofdelivery of antivirals involves telephone reporting ofsymptoms and sick individuals 'phoning a friend' to askthem to collect a course of antivirals from a drugdistribution centre (the aim being that sick people stayat home). We were concerned about the possibility offraud in this system and about its feasibility for manypeople in single person households. The Department ofHealth stated in its evidence that the delivery system iscurrently being reviewed. We agree that no system canprevent fraud completely, but current plans seemespecially inadequate in this regard. We support theDepartment of Health's plans to investigate innovativemeans of delivery, preferably with drugs being deliveredto the household, thus minimising the degree to whichpotentially infected individuals mix in the community. The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 16 | November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policy4.7 Research during a pandemic Following clinical experience in Vietnam (de Jong et al 2005) it is apparent that details of the use of antiviraldrugs such as dosage and resistance need to beestablished for H5N1 infections and research in this areais essential, particularly in initial outbreaks, to optimizesubsequent use of the stockpile. The collection andinterpretation of clinical data during the initial stages ofa pandemic will be needed to establish differencesbetween the novel pandemic strain and seasonalinfluenza (see sections 3.3 and 6.3.2). Differences suchas severity, extended length of illness and non-respiratory shedding of viruses will also need to beestablished. This may lead to the need for an increase inthe recommended doses of oseltamivir used intreatment and possibly, prophylaxis. WHO will have a central role in ensuring that the data are availablefrom the first reported outbreaks and the resultinginformation is effectively disseminated to decisionmakers to guide interventions. The Department ofHealth should use its influence internationally toensure this research is supported and can be donewherever the initial outbreaks occur (R16). In the evidence that we received, resistance to antivirals was raised as an issue that requires careful monitoringat the international level. The Neuraminidase InhibitorSusceptibility Network (NISN) is an international groupdrawn from WHO laboratories, public health expertsand academics, and the network is funded by Rocheand GSK. NISN facilitates the exchange of informationon drug resistance internationally, but it requires therelevant support, data and endorsement for it tosucceed. There is a need to improve the technology fordetecting the emergence of resistance, includingimprovements in genotyping and phenotyping andhigh-throughput screening. We recommend that intensification of the surveillance of the sensitivityof current human and avian influenza viruses(H5N1 in particular) to antiviral drugs (the M2 andneuraminidase inhibitors) should be coordinatedby WHO and undertaken on a global basis. Inparticular, the system should ensure thatsurveillance has the sensitivity to measure thedegree to which a resistant virus is beingtransmitted in the community (R17). Illness severity associated with the emergence of antiviral resistance will need to be monitored both inpatients in whom resistance develops and, if it occurs, in people infected with resistant strains. In conjunction, the effectiveness of antivirals and the benefits ofcombination antiviral therapy (ie two neuraminidaseinhibitors or a neuraminidase inhibitor and an M2inhibitor) compared with a single drug needs to beinvestigated. With combination and effectiveness trialsthere are ethical issues associated with providingdifferent treatments to a group of individuals that needto be addressed in advance (see section 6.3.2).The useof seasonal influenza as a model to conduct theseclinical trials should be considered. Early data shouldalso indicate what is the most cost-effective use ofantivirals in the pandemic situation by identifying groupssuch as children, high-risk patients or working adults forwhom treatments are most effective. The evidence base for antiviral treatment of individuals in riskgroups (eg those with an immune deficiencycondition) needs to be reviewed by theDepartment of Health and if necessary expanded,with particular emphasis being placed on protocolsto minimise the emergence of resistance in suchpopulations (R18). Suitable diagnostic tests are not currently available but research on various procedures to capture the virus fromclinical samples and on different detection processes arein progress. The availability of diagnostics will bediscussed further in section 6.3.1. 4.8 New antiviral agents The development of new antiviral agents would allow further flexibility in developing treatment and prophylaxis options during a pandemic. In theevidence we received from Roche and GSK neithercompany said it had plans to develop novel antiviraldrugs. We understand that few, if any, novelcompounds for treating influenza are in thedevelopment pipeline of the other large pharmaceutical companies involved in research and development in the field of infectious disease, but there are some in development by smallercompanies. We recommend that research in both industry and academia aimed at thedevelopment and evaluation of novel antivirals for influenza should be encouraged andsupported. Extensive links already exist betweenacademic research and the pharmaceuticalindustries and public-private partnerships could be developed in this area (R19). The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 17The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 18 | November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policyThe Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 195.1 Introduction Influenza vaccines are used to stimulate antibody production against the virus, in order to prevent orreduce the effects of infection. This section will discussthe use of seasonal influenza vaccines in humans, thecurrent H5N1 avian influenza vaccines and the use ofvaccines in a pandemic. 5.2 Seasonal influenza vaccines It is well established that vaccines, either inactivatedwhole virus or subunits of haemagglutinin andneuraminidase, are very effective against seasonalinfluenza. The effectiveness correlates with the capacityof the vaccine to stimulate neutralising antibodies(antibodies that inhibit the infectivity of the influenzavirus) and the vaccines are effective if there is a goodmatch between the antigen in the vaccines and theantigens of the seasonal virus. The system for selecting the expected virus strains is coordinated by WHO. Twice a year WHO recommendsthe strains to be included in the vaccine ahead of theinfluenza season in either the northern or the southernhemisphere. Standard methods for vaccine productionwere developed more than 50 years ago and involvegrowing the identified virus strains in embryonatedchicken eggs before harvesting, chemically inactivating,and purifying the virus, followed by detergentdisruption where appropriate. Newer methods ofvaccine production are mentioned in section 5.6. In general the system works well and provides sufficient vaccine for those countries with influenza vaccinationprogrammes. Current global capacity for themanufacture of trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine isestimated to be 350 million doses per year. In the UKthese vaccines are targeted at those most at risk: thoseaged 65 and over and those with chronic illness.Vaccination is required each year to achieve a high levelof protection and production capacity would be severelystretched if public or government demand was toincrease suddenly (see section 5.4). The threat of a newpandemic influenza virus, H5N1 or otherwise, is real andthe present capacity in vaccine manufacture is not ableto meet the challenges that would be posed by apandemic. These challenges are discussed further insection 5.4. Experience in the UK in relation to the efficacy of paediatric vaccination in children under the age of five islimited. Many very young children are immunologically naive to influenza and furtherresearch is needed on the characteristics ofprimary immune responses and the safety andefficacy of the use of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines in children. We recommend thatthis research is supported by the Department ofHealth as a matter of urgency (R20). 5.3 Human H5N1 vaccines Since the emergence of H5N1, the pharmaceuticalindustry has shown a real interest in preparing vaccinesagainst pandemic influenza and will undoubtedly be inthe forefront of any vaccine strategy if a pandemicappears. Several H5N1 influenza virus vaccines, based on avian viruses that have infected humans in Asia, are currentlyundergoing phase 1 or 2 clinical trials in humanvolunteers. To date, the most promising results havecome from a Chinese study by Sinovac Biotech Ltd usinga modified whole virus vaccine at two doses of 10 g with an alum adjuvant (Lin et al 2006). Studies bySanofi-Pasteur in France and CSL in Australia using asubunit vaccine with alum were not as successful. In theSanofi Pasteur study two vaccine doses of 30 g were required to achieve a good immune response and CSLreported a response with two doses of 15 g, but only in half of the people tested (Bresson et al 2006; Treanor etal 2006; CSL 2006). In July 2006, GSK announcedpromising results of a whole virus vaccine with aproprietary adjuvant at a dose of only 3.8 g, but the full results of this study are not published and the adjuvantused is not approved for general use. Current H5N1 vaccines therefore require two or more immunizations three to four weeks apart to stimulatelevels of antibody that are considered to be neutralizing,and in the majority of cases, the dose of vaccine neededis significantly higher than standard seasonal influenzavaccines. Urgent research is needed in this area to findlow-dose vaccines that generate a good immuneresponse, ideally after one dose. It is also unclear howwell the antibodies stimulated by these vaccines cross-react with the range of avian H5N1 viruses isolated fromboth birds and humans in different countries to date.This information is critical if an informed judgement isto be made on the chances of such a vaccinestimulating an antibody response against a mutatedavian H5N1 virus that might become a humanpandemic strain. Live attenuated influenza virus vaccines are also licensed for use in some countries and could be valuable in apandemic. Their production involves the use of reversegenetics (see section 5.6) and reassortment proceduresto prepare attenuated vaccine viruses. Similar issues tothose discussed for inactivated virus vaccines in relationto the preparation of appropriate vaccine viruses, cross-5 Human vaccinationreactivity, and establishing their effectiveness in the face of an H5N1 pandemic, need to be addressed.Vaccines of this sort may have an additional, but as yet unproven, advantage of stimulating cellular (T cell)immune responses. 5.3.1 Population primingAnother strategy to be considered is to stockpile vaccine for population priming. Even without an exact match invirus strain, it may be possible to provide broad immunityin the population by vaccinating with a pre-pandemicvaccine. Once a pandemic virus is identified and avaccine produced, it could also mean that only one doseof the up-to-date vaccine will be required following suchpriming (rather than the predicted two doses) and atmuch lower doses. This has obvious implications for thenumber of people that could be immunised withvaccines prepared from the pandemic virus once theybecame available. One of the current H5N1 vaccinesbeing developed might be considered for use as apriming dose, for delivery once a pandemic has begun. 5.3.2 Cross-reactive immunityPre-pandemic vaccination with the current avian influenza virus vaccines might lead to the emergence of'original antigenic sin'. This term is used to describe thesurprising finding that people who had not beenexposed to an influenza virus subtype for decades stillhad antibodies to that virus. This finding can now beinterpreted as resulting from persistence in the immunesystem of B cell memory cells (which make antibodies),maintained in the blood, with possible help from cross-reacting T cells. It has been suggested thatimmunological priming by natural infection might be sostrong that vaccination would not be effective, onlyrestimulating the original and less useful antibodyresponse. However there is no convincing evidence thatrepeated vaccination, such as seasonal influenzavaccination, with updated viruses becomes less effectivewith time. Thus it seems very unlikely that immunisationof humans with a pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccine wouldincrease any health risk during a subsequent pandemicby adversely affecting the antibody response made tothe infecting virus. The question remains whether pre-pandemic vaccination would be useful for protection.Vaccines that stimulate cellular (T cell) immuneresponses which cross-react with different influenzavirus subtypes, may affect the severity of infection,irrespective of the infecting virus. The development ofsuch preparations and research on their effectivenessare priorities. 5.3.3 Purchase of pandemic vaccinesSome countries are making advance purchase agreements with vaccine manufacturers for pandemicvaccines, with the aim of vaccinating their entire populations. In the UK, the Department of Health has purchased a total of 3.3 million doses of vaccine againstan H5N1 virus to be used for the vaccination of keyhealthcare workers in the event of a pandemic. The twocontracts for the supply of these vaccines were awardedin March 2006 to Novartis Vaccines (formally ChironVaccines) and Baxter Healthcare Corporation. TheNovartis product is an egg-grown subunit vaccineadjuvanted with a proprietary agent, MF59, and theBaxter product is a cell-grown whole virus vaccine withalum as the adjuvant. Vaccine production using cellculture involves growing animal or human cells and theninfecting them. The virus produced by the infected cell isharvested, inactivated and purified, as for the egg-grown vaccine. Recently the Department of Health hasannounced the purchase of further H5N1 virus vaccinesthat would be sufficient for priming and boostinginjections for the whole population of the UK. In its evidence to this study, the Department of Health said that the two vaccines were purchased on the basisof preliminary immunogenicity data but that no datafrom animal or human studies were available for theseparticular pandemic vaccines at the time of the contractbeing awarded. It also reported that the differentproduction methods and adjuvants spread the risk ofbuying an ineffective product. It is crucial that thosewho decide what vaccines are commissioned andstockpiled make transparent and accountable decisions.However, owing to commercial sensitivities, very littleinformation is publicly available on these vaccines andthe type of immune response stimulated. In particular,the extent to which the immunity that they produce iscross-reactive with the different H5N1 viruses currentlyin circulation has not been reported. It is thereforedifficult to assess whether the best decisions have been made. Under the MRC's influenza initiative, funding of up to \u00a37million over the next 18 months hasbeen made available for research on H5N1 vaccines. We recommend that the Department of Healthmakes samples of the recently purchased H5N1vaccines available to the research community, assoon as is practicably possible, and that the MRCsolicits high-quality research applicationsspecifically to analyse these vaccines (R21). Independent high-level scientific advice should be sought in an open way before any decision is made totake a particular approach to vaccination that couldaffect the lives of millions. The working group founddifficulty in penetrating the barrier of confidentiality thatsurrounds the industry and its relationship with theDepartment of Health. We urge the Department of Health to make arrangements with industry thatallow it to be open and transparent in its decisionmaking and procurement processes, to useindependent experts to advise as appropriate, andto make the evidence on which decisions are madeavailable to the scientific community (R22). The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 20 | November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policyThe Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 215.4 Problems with producing a pandemic vaccine Vaccination will be a key element in dealing with a pandemic and there are advantages in developing avaccine prior to the pandemic, focusing on potentialpandemic strains such as H5N1 either for use either inpre-pandemic vaccination or to stockpile in the event ofa pandemic. However, this is not a perfect solutionbecause of the possibility that the emerging pandemicstrain may differ significantly from a pre-preparedvaccine. The most efficacious vaccine will be the one based on the pandemic virus itself, but production can begin onlyonce the virus is isolated and rendered safe. It isestimated that, using current production methods, it islikely to take seven to nine months before initial dosesof a pandemic vaccine are available. By this time the firstwave of the pandemic is likely to have passed, andpossibly a second wave. The regulatory agencies also have a part to play in ensuring that in an emergency vaccines could beproduced and licensed safely but without delay. InMarch 2004 the European Medicines Agency issuedguidelines on 'core dossiers' for the submission ofmarketing authorization applications for pandemicinfluenza vaccines. These guidelines provide a route foraccelerated regulatory approval through the submissionof the prototype pandemic vaccine files before thepandemic arrives. Despite the probability that a vaccine against a pandemic virus would contain only one virus rather thanthree in the trivalent seasonal vaccine, global capacityfor the production of influenza vaccines is not sufficientto meet the demands of pandemic vaccine production.In a pandemic, the demand for vaccination may be tentimes or more the current 350 million doses of seasonalinfluenza vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines will alsoprobably be required in a pandemic. It is unrealistic tobelieve that demand would be met by investments inadditional manufacturing plants. We were told inevidence to this study that it is not commercially viablefor the vaccine industry to commit the necessaryresources to scale up production in advance of apandemic when there is no existing market, the threatof a pandemic may be years away and the risk in anysingle year may be considered to be low. Increasing theuptake of seasonal influenza vaccines by recommendingvaccination for those over 50 years of age and, in theUK, by allowing individuals to purchase seasonalvaccines from their own GP may increase capacityslightly but, in order to meet demand, more efficient'antigen sparing' strategies are required (see section5.4.1). We recommend that the Department of Health continues to expand its seasonal influenzavaccine programme and relaxes rules aboutindividuals outside the 'at risk' groups purchasing seasonal influenza vaccines directly from NHS GPs,to encourage industry to increase productioncapacity (R23). 5.4.1 Antigen sparingIn the long-term, there is a need to develop innovative technologies for vaccine production (see section 5.6).However, immediate attention for vaccines must bedirected to a coordinated international approach tovaccine evaluation, paying attention to ways in whichthe least amount of virus can immunise the largestnumber of people which is known as antigen sparing. At low doses, a whole virus vaccine induces a greater antibody response than a subunit vaccine and thereforemore people could be vaccinated using the samequantity of vaccine. However, whole virus vaccines cancause more side effects, particularly in the young, andthese must be balanced against the chances of severeillness or death from a pandemic virus. Vaccinemanufacturers are currently producing mainly subunitseasonal influenza vaccines. In order to change to awhole virus vaccine for use in a pandemic, the processfor seasonal influenza vaccine production would need to be changed. This is a significant undertaking, but we recommend that the Department of Health andthe vaccine industry continue to evaluate the useof whole virus vaccines and to monitor the resultsof ongoing trials of whole virus vaccines againstH5N1 (R24). An alternative method of antigen sparing is the use of adjuvants which reduce the antigen dose required in avaccine. The use of adjuvants can also broaden theimmune response to a vaccine and there is evidence ofcross-protection against antigenic variants. There isconsiderable scope for developing novel adjuvants. We recommend that as a matter of urgency theDepartment of Health takes the lead in assemblinga work programme with industry and academia forthe development of new adjuvants for vaccines.This should be done in parallel with clinical trialsto compare directly the effectiveness of currentadjuvants with existing H5N1 pandemic vaccines,with whole virus vaccines and with informationsharing from ongoing trials (R25). 5.5 Passive antibodies In addition to vaccination, intravenous or intramuscularinjection of antibodies with a high neutralising titreagainst avian influenza could be useful in treatinginfected people or offering prophylaxis. Severalexamples exist of the use of antibodies in otherinfectious diseases, such as palivizumab, a monoclonalantibody that is used to prevent and treat severeinfections with respiratory syncital virus in young children. Furthermore, passive administration ofimmunoglobulin from hepatitis A virus immune donorswas used as an effective prophylaxis against that virus,although it has now been superseded by a successfulvaccine. Monoclonal antibodies against H5N1 avian influenza virus are being prepared for human use by a number ofbiotechnology companies, and serum donations couldbe requested from those who have recovered. However,such treatments will depend on the pre-preparedantibodies cross-reacting efficiently with the pandemicstrain and are likely to be very expensive and limited inavailability. 5.6 Further research This study has found that there is no coordinatedapproach to vaccine research, development andevaluation, so there may be duplication of someapproaches and omission of others. A greaterunderstanding is clearly required of cellular, innate, andadaptive immune responses in protection from diseaseand in determining disease severity. Standardised clinical assay methods for the evaluation of pre-pandemic and pandemic vaccines are also urgently needed. We recommend that WHO coordinates a globalproject for sharing information and data onongoing influenza vaccine research anddevelopment, in both the commercial andacademic sectors (R26). Several newer and faster methods exist for producing influenza vaccines, including reverse genetics and DNAvaccines. The technology of reverse genetics allowsrapid production of vaccine candidate viruses containingthe required haemagglutinin and neuraminidaseproteins and is often faster than traditional methods forgenerating a vaccine virus. DNA vaccines are prepared by inserting virus DNA into plasmids that are purified and delivered by injection. Theviral DNA in the plasmids is transcribed in thetransfected cell and the expressed viral protein inducesan immune response. Recently announced results of apreliminary trial of a seasonal influenza DNA vaccinedelivered into the skin using a 'gene gun' appearpromising. Further research and development and datasharing are needed in these areas. The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 22 | November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policyThe Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 236.1 Introduction As discussed in sections 4 and 5, the most effective public health interventions to mitigate the impact of apandemic are through the use of antiviral drugs andimmunisation with an effective vaccine against the virus.This section will discuss the additional public healthresponse to a pandemic; three areas were considered: \u0081 pre-pandemic planning and preparation (section 6.2); \u0081 delivery during a pandemic (section 6.3);\u0081 post-pandemic evaluation (section 6.4).These areas are obviously broad and cannot be covered in detail by this report. Several reports and reviews have considered the public health questions that areraised in detail, for example those by Fleming (2005)and Pickles (2006). 6.2 Pre-pandemic planning and preparation Public health pre-pandemic planning requires integratedactivity across all government departments and betweencentral and local government in the UK. This is beingachieved through central government planning togetherwith local and regional systems. Feedback from localhealth, emergency, educational and social servicesproviders is being used to assess the viability ofproposed methods of intervention in medical and socialcare following the outbreak of a pandemic virus. However, devolution of planning to local organisational levels (for example in the education sector), which isnecessary to customise plans according to circumstancesand resource availability, inevitably means that centralcontrol is eroded. In conditions where there isconsiderable uncertainty (for example about the timingof the outbreak, its scale, its source and, its treatment),scenario planning, such as that occurring now, cancause confusion and doubt among practitioners andtheir managers. Any ambiguity in the requirements ofcentral government imposed on local systems will bemagnified and is likely to undermine efficiency. Centralgovernment may need to use a core briefing team inthe period when plans are being confirmed. This couldcomprise one or more mobile multidisciplinary groupsthat could respond to individual local planning problemswith a clear and centrally determined approach. Suchteams could profitably include public health experts andbehavioural and operational researchers.Emergency plans should always be tested to the point of collapse - not only to identify ways in which they canbe improved but also to provide indications of how much confidence should be placed in them.Particularly important for testing pandemic plans will be an examination of what happens if there isescalation beyond the 'worst case' scenarios uponwhich the plans are predicated (see box 1). Testing the critical assumptions within the plans should be done independently of those who formulatethe plans, though being in informed by them.Recognising that such testing is iterative, the processcould be done by a team of behavioural scientists on standby to provide state-of-the-art advice onattitudinal, motivational and behavioural factors that might be relevant for policy development orimplementation. We hope that the updated UK Health Departments' influenza pandemic contingencyplan, due to be published in spring 2007, takes accountof the results of recent simulation exercises and includesa strategy to test further the plan's critical assumptions.We recommend that the Department of Healthshould commission external experts to scrutinisethe revised pandemic influenza plan and whereappropriate should form expert groups to reviewcritical aspects of the plan (R27). 6.2.1 Clinical management guidelinesThe current pandemic influenza clinical guidelines were compiled by a multi-professional committeecomprising representatives from the British ThoracicSociety, the British Infection Society and the HPA, acting on behalf of the Department of Health. Theseguidelines were revised and published online in March2006 (British Thoracic Society, British Infection Society,Health Protection Agency and the Department of Health 2006). They were based on current knowledgeand data extrapolated from previous influenzapandemics, seasonal influenza and the limited dataavailable from human cases of H5N1. However, the true nature of the disease caused by a new pandemic influenza virus will become apparentonly as a pandemic develops and it will be vital to study the first few cases in a pandemic extensively (see section 6.3.2). The determinants of the clinicalcourse of influenza are currently poorly understood, as are the most effective clinical care programmes. It is therefore essential that any guidelines can be rapidly updated and revised as experience emergesduring a pandemic and communicated rapidlythroughout the NHS. Investigations in South-East Asia suggest that an enhanced immune response 6 Public healthin the nature of a 'cytokine storm' may have been involved in the extreme pathogenesis observed (de Jong et al 2006) and research should be undertaken on processes to control such responses. Clinical management guidelines must also take into account the practicalities of reduced facilities andservices that many clinicians may face in practice in apandemic, eg the acute shortage of intensive care andventilatory facilities. A recent study used communitymodelling to examine the demand for intensive carebeds in England in a pandemic and predicted thatcapacity will be needed at more than 200% of thatpresently available (Menon et al 2005). 6.2.2 Infection control and non-pharmaceutical interventions Infection control and 'non-pharmaceutical interventions' such as personal protective equipment and socialdistancing measures are likely to play a role in modifyingthe impact of a pandemic. Preparations should be madein advance, and the necessary research conducted, to identify those interventions likely to have the greatest impact. Information on the practicality and efficacy of infection control is currently incomplete and the preventativemeasures to be employed are not clear. Since vaccinesmay not be available at the onset of a pandemic andthe supply of antivirals may be limited, advice is needed on practical infection control steps. Thesemeasures may help prevent the spread of disease inhospitals and community settings. This advice needs to be communicated effectively to healthcare workersand the public and should include: \u0081 the value, if any, of personal protective equipment such as face masks; \u0081 protocols for hand washing;\u0081 disinfection routines for hospitals;\u0081 information on the isolation of 'known infected' and 'not known to be infected' individuals, hospitalwards or residential homes. Such non-pharmaceutical interventions may be the only measures available for many countries in apandemic. As discussed in section 3.4, these measuresmay be highly effective in theory, but may requirecorrect and rigorous adherence to protocols to beeffective, which may be difficult in practice. Little isknown about the measures that are likely to work andthere are several reasons for this. In the situation ofseasonal influenza, the availability of vaccines andantivirals means that there has not been any incentive to study these interventions. It is also difficult to drawconclusions about activities that are not easily subject to randomised trials. Therefore observational studies may be the only way to provide the necessaryinformation. Although it may be possible to obtain datausing modelling to inform decision making on the useof non-pharmaceutical interventions, as used to informappropriate use of vaccines and antivirals. We are concerned that the commissioning of studies on the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventionsmay fall between the remits of different agencies,departments and of the MRC. Therefore we recommend that the HPA, and the Department ofHealth identify research that should be conductedto identify those non-pharmaceutical interventionslikely to have the greatest impact and, whereappropriate, commission trials to assess theeffectiveness of these interventions (R28).Observational studies and modelling could also be usedto provide the necessary information. The appropriateprocess for the ethical approval of research during apandemic must also be completed in advance so as notto hinder essential work. 6.3 Delivery in a pandemic This section describes areas that are important for aneffective public health response in a pandemic. 6.3.1 DiagnosticsCurrent clinical guidelines give GPs and other healthcare professionals reasonable means to diagnose influenza.However, during an outbreak the symptoms ofpandemic influenza may not always be specific enoughto discriminate between those who have influenza andthose who are worried they may be infected and arerequesting antivirals. Ideally a fast-acting near-patient test (such as a dip-stick test), with a sufficiently high positive predictive valuecoupled with a simple delivery system, which could beused in both developed and developing countries,would be available. However, such a test does notcurrently exist and, from the evidence we received, thereis little interest from commercial companies to developone. Further research in this area is needed to enhancework that is already underway to develop such a testand make testing a routine laboratory procedure ratherthan a specialised skill. We recommend that bodies such as the European Commission should considerways to stimulate an environment which wouldencourage investment in new diagnostic productsfor influenza (R29). Current virological and molecular tests to track and characterise the viruses involved for antigenic variationand drug sensitivity will be of great epidemiologicalimportance in a pandemic (section 3). Both expertiseand equipment are in place for these in laboratories of The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 24 | November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policyThe Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 25the HPA. However, currently available diagnostics are likely to have little impact in primary care because theyare time consuming and expensive (costing more than adose of oseltamivir) and have low sensitivity. Diagnosticsmay have some benefit in selected settings such ashospitals, especially in the early phases of an epidemic,for recognition of infection in frontline healthcare staff.It will also be important to diagnose the first cases toprovide as much information about the type of virus.However, near-patient diagnostics may not be relevantonce the pandemic has become a population problem. 6.3.2 Clinical research during a pandemicClinical and translational research will be needed to increase understanding about an emerging pandemicstrain and the respective host and virus mediatedcontributions to clinical disease and outcome. Althoughsome studies can use seasonal influenza as a model,much of this research can be undertaken only whereand when human cases arise (hence, to date, most datahave come from Vietnam and China). It will beimportant to compile and compare clinical data onhuman cases in order to understand more about theroutes of transmission, to identify the groups most atrisk, to guide preventive measures and earlyinterventions, and to find improved treatments. At thestart of a pandemic, epidemiological data on the modesof transmission and virus pathogenicity will informdecisions about the target groups for vaccination andantiviral drugs. Furthermore, a greater understanding of the efficacy of antiviral drugs, their optimum dose,prescribing regimens and the monitoring of antiviralresistance will lead to improved treatment during apandemic, as outlined in section 4. However, the practicalities of conducting research in a pandemic must be addressed in advance. Researchprogrammes are often conducted in several centres,require consent from patients (who may well beunconscious), must have defined protocols and requireethical and regulatory approval in advance, as well asneeding to be funded and staffed by appropriatehealthcare professionals. In the UK, the Department of Health is working with the MRC to design researchstudies in advance and to deal with ethical clearance asfar as possible ahead of time. During a pandemic ethics cannot be disregarded, so approval for protocols must be granted in advance. TheDepartment of Health indicated in its evidence to thisstudy that the problems of ethical approval are currentlybeing considered. The Director of Pandemic InfluenzaPreparedness within the Department of Health hasformed a Committee on Ethical Aspects of PandemicInfluenza to advise on the ethical issues in health andsocial care and in public health arising from an influenzapandemic. This committee will not take the place of theethical review process but will decide what changesshould be made to current processes in a pandemic.Regarding funding in advance of a pandemic, the MRC issued a call for proposals on influenza research inDecember 2005 and an additional \u00a315 million forinfluenza research has been made available until March2008. The call for evidence included proposals for'readiness' grants to support research that could be putinto effect only in the early stages of a pandemic. TheMRC plans to put these peer-reviewed grants in place inorder to address important, urgent questions if apandemic occurs, for example clinical work on a newlycirculating strain. In addition, the MRC also consideredrequests temporarily to suspend existing MRC grants inother areas of research so that urgent influenza researchmight be undertaken. We welcome the MRC's initiativeto promote and solicit the best possible researchproposals on influenza from researchers and torecognise that response-mode research proposals maynot sufficiently address the areas of work required. 6.3.3 Behavioural modellingThe success of public health operational delivery plans will to a large extent depend upon having made thecorrect predictions about the behaviour of the publicand of emergency service workers. Making suchpredictions is hampered by the absence of relevantinformation. There are historical studies of thebehaviour of individuals in earlier pandemics but thequality of the data collected is unknown, particularlywhen it comes to changes in individual or groupbehaviour in what might be characterised as the threephases of the pandemic (the threat stage; the outbreak;the aftermath). In any case, it is inappropriate to usesuch data as do exist from these past pandemics topredict what would happen today. The bases of somuch of social life have changed - not just the ageprofile but family structures, the authority-responsibilityhierarchies, the accepted technologies ofcommunication and expectations of mobility. Baseline data on relevant current behavioural and attitudinal patterns (beyond those needed for modellingthe spread of the disease) could be brought together toinform planning. This would also provide the baselinefor subsequent evaluation of the impact of thepandemic. The social science community would be ableto advise on the availability of extant data and themethods for collecting new data. Special attentionwould need to be paid to subcultural and internationalvariations in behaviour that may be important duringand after the pandemic. There would be merit in across-department governmental approach in this (ieminimally incorporating key health-related, mobility-related and economic-related behaviour patterns). We recommend that the government, togetherwith the Economics and Social Research Council(ESRC), should consider procedures to collect dataon behavioural and attitudinal patterns, bothcurrently and throughout a pandemic. These datawould also allow subsequent analyses of the impact of the pandemic and, more importantly, provide the basis for predictive models ofbehaviour that could be used in refining andimproving planning for future pandemics ofinfluenza and other infectious diseases (R30). 6.3.4 Communications strategyThe government has invested in research on risk communication and we heard evidence that thestrategies of the Department of Health and Defra areinformed by this work. In September 2005 the RoyalSociety held a joint workshop with the Food StandardsAgency to explore potential social science insights forrisk assessment. The report of the meeting identifiedfive key principles to enable more effective riskassessment and related management andcommunications processes that are directly relevant topreparedness for an influenza pandemic (Royal Societyand Food Standards Agency 2006): \u0081 stakeholders and the public (where appropriate) should be consulted on the framing of questions tobe put to expert scientific advisory committees; \u0081 a cyclical and iterative process to inform risk assessment, management and communicationshould be developed; \u0081 assumptions and uncertainty in risk assessment should be acknowledged; \u0081 public and stakeholder engagement should be broadened at the different stages of the process,particularly on issues of controversy or highuncertainty; and \u0081 it is important to be clear about your audiences and communicate the things that matter to them. Effective communication in a pandemic will be vital in optimising the behaviour of the public and emergencyservice workers. Yet the communications strategy willneed to be different from probably any otherconstructed in response to an emergency, disaster orcrisis because: \u0081 the messages will issue from many sources simultaneously, they will be frequent, they will bemultilayered (with information, instruction,reassurances, threats), they will be aimed atmultiple audiences (the public will not besusceptible to being treated as a homogeneousmass), and they will be channelled through agreater variety of media (including possibly textmessages and web-based sources); \u0081 the messages will be part of the management of what might be called a 'chronic emergency' - notsomething that is finished in a finite, relativelyshort, period - and is also a 'diffuse emergency' - not located in one place or attacking selectedgroups of people; \u0081 the messages will need to explain decisions that will themselves be based upon manyuncertainties, and justification for decisions based on uncertainty (and thus the gaining ofsupport or compliance) is notoriously difficult.Tactics for dealing with a situation in which the general public (or even some subset of the public) rejects government advice or loses faith in government credibility concerning thepandemic should be developed, especially sincethere is some evidence that the public does nottrust government to deal honestly and effectivelywith health crises. The need to establish that the proposed communications strategy is capable of dealing withthese issues is evident. It is necessary to have a strategythat is fit for purpose throughout the three phases ofthe pandemic (before the outbreak, during it and in theaftermath) and the same tactics of communication maynot be appropriate in all of them. It will also beimportant to know whether the communication withthe public that has already happened has been effectiveand sufficient. Informing and alerting the public to whatwill be expected of them prior to the outbreak isnecessary. This anticipatory communication will be vitalbecause it must be expected that the 'normal' channelsof communication (eg the websites) will fail, even thosededicated to specific audience groups. Mechanisms forreaching difficult to access subsets of the public who aredifficult to access such as those who will not be readyrecipients of media-based messages, need to beconsidered. Given the growing number of single-personhouseholds, the assumption that person-to-personroutes of communication will operate may beerroneous. To ensure the communications strategy is fit for purpose we recommend that thegovernment's planned communications strategyshould be subject to independent review andtesting within six months of the publication of therevised Pandemic Plan (R31). 6.4 Post-pandemic evaluation The viability of effective evaluation of the impact of thepandemic or of the way in which it was managed willdepend upon the collection of the right data before,during and after the outbreak. What constitutes the'right' data will be a matter of debate. Accordingly, consultations should be undertaken now withstakeholders about the most appropriate data tobe collected and the most effective methods tocollect these data in order to evaluate the impactof a pandemic. Having a database that will servethe purposes of modelling and prediction as wellas evaluation should be attempted (R32). The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 26 | November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policyThe Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 277.1 Introduction The incorporation of science into both national and international policymaking on pandemic preparedness is crucial, and policies must be updated regularly as theevidence base relating to influenza grows. In this sectionwe consider the structures for scientific advice inpolicymaking in the UK in relation to pandemicinfluenza. The UK is responsible for preparing its own contingency plans but international bodies such as WHO, OIE andthe United Nations (UN) have central strategic andcoordination roles. WHO has responsibility forcoordinating global influenza surveillance, fordetermining pandemic alert levels (and hence 'declaring'a pandemic), for setting international recommendationsfor surveillance and pandemic preparedness, and forcluster investigation and response. OIE has responsibilityfor coordinating and setting guidelines for globalsurveillance of avian influenza, principally in domesticpoultry, for defining guidelines for control of avianinfluenza outbreaks, and for collating and publishingglobal surveillance data. Dr David Nabarro wasappointed as UN System Coordinator for Avian andHuman Influenza in September 2005. Dr Nabarro isresponsible for ensuring that the UN system makes aneffective and coordinated contribution to the globaleffort to control the epidemic of avian influenza andsupports effective local, national, regional and globalpreparations for a potential influenza pandemic. In turn,the UN is guided by its specialised agencies responsiblefor animal and human health (FAO and WHO). 7.2 Policymaking in the United Kingdom The Cabinet Office has the overall cross-governmentcoordinating role, though the Civil ContingenciesSecretariat (CCS), in planning for civil contingenciesincluding pandemic influenza. Response planning andimplementation are the responsibilities of the relevantdepartment: the Department of Health in the case ofpandemic influenza and the Defra in the case of avianinfluenza in animals. A number of other departmentssuch as the Department of Education and Skills, theDepartment of Transport and the Home Office haveroles in the wider delivery of pandemic preparedness. All government departments have access to scientific advice through various mechanisms. These include theGovernment's Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA), the ChiefMedical Officer (CMO), the Chief Veterinary Officer, andthe departmental Chief Scientific Advisers. There arenumerous advisory committees that provide scientificadvice to inform government policy in this area. Thefollowing section describes these committees anddiscusses the extent to which scientific evidence is incorporated into policymaking. 7.2.1 Advisory committee structureThe UK government is well equipped with science advisory committees with some responsibility for avianand pandemic influenza and both Defra and theDepartment of Health have expended considerableresources in developing contingency plans. The Ministerial Committee of the Cabinet on Influenza Pandemic Planning (MISC32) has terms of reference 'to guide the preparations for a potential influenzapandemic and related international activity'. ThisCommittee is chaired by the Secretary of State forHealth and receives its scientific advice from the CSA.The CMO also attends as required. This Committee hasheld a number of pandemic influenza exercises withingovernment, which have proved useful in identifyingshortcomings in existing planning. In the evidence wereceived we were told that the CSA provides a'challenge function' regarding the science base ofdecision making within this Committee and to eachgovernment department. Whilst the CSA and CMO play a vital role in providing advice to MISC32, we believe that the scientific advicegiven to the Committee could be strengthened by theinput of an independent scientist with expertisespecifically in pandemic influenza. We therefore recommend the appointment of a leading non-governmental scientist in the area of influenza aslead questioner and adviser to MISC32 for specificissues, complementing the roles of the CSA andthe CMO. This scientist should be appointed jointlyby the CSA and CMO in discussion with relevantlearned societies. This model should be adopted inall future Ministerial committees for other animaland human health emergencies (R33). The UK National Influenza Pandemic Committee (UKNIPC) is the main forum for the provision ofspecialist advice to the UK Health Departments on the health response before and during an influenzapandemic and it is chaired by the CMO. TheDepartment of Health for England's National Director ofPandemic Influenza Preparedness jointly chairs the cross-government group with the head of the CCS whichincludes membership from the key departmentsinvolved in planning for an influenza pandemic. Ministers and UKNIPC are advised about the scientific evidence base for health-related pandemic influenzapolicies by the Department of Health's PandemicInfluenza Scientific Advisory Group (SAG). Membershipof SAG includes independent scientists as well as7 Science and policymaking The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 28 | November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policymedical and scientific representatives from across government, HPA, NIBSC, MRC, the WHO CollaboratingCentre for Reference and Research on Influenza, NIMR,the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation,the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens, theNational Expert Panel on New and Emerging Infectionsand the European Centre for Disease Prevention andControl. Two sub-groups advise on, and review, work onmathematical modelling and surveillance. The European avian influenza legislation is the main driver that shapes Defra's policy in the form of the UK'scontingency plans and its stakeholder engagement.Defra and UKNIPC are advised on the scientific evidencebase for avian influenza by Defra's Scientific AdvisoryCouncil (SAC) which is made up of expert, independentscientists and veterinarians across a range of disciplines.The Epidemic Diseases subgroup of SAC recentlyreviewed Defra's contingency plan for avian influenzaoutbreaks in UK poultry and reported to the SAC inJune 2006 with a number of recommendations (DefraScience Advisory Council 2006). Defra and UKNIP arealso advised by an ad hoc ornithological advisory groupconvened the Veterinary Exotic Diseases Division ofDefra. Defra has not established any further committeesto advise on avian influenza. 7.2.2 Advisory committee remitAlthough each cross-governmental and departmental committee operates under a specific remit, it is difficultto understand the complex relationship betweenadvisory committees and different governmentdepartments in determining how policy is developed inthe areas of avian and pandemic influenza and howscience is incorporated into the process. The role of science in policymaking at the ministerial level in the lead departments is unclear from theevidence we received. In particular, the decisions relatingto seeking advice, the source of advice, and whether theadvice and available evidence are used, must all be moretransparent. From the evidence we received, the basisfor choosing a source of scientific advice also seems aclosed matter. Although the quality of in-housegovernment scientists is undoubtedly good, it is clearlydifficult for these scientists to be expert across all of theissues of concern to their departments. The role and remit of science advisory committees in relation topandemic influenza should be made explicit andthe organisational decision making routes shouldbe clarified to show how scientific advice isutilised (R34). An organisational flow chart to clarify the decision making routes should be available on eachdepartment's website to explain to the public and otherstakeholders how decisions are reached. All committees should aim to operate in a transparent manner wherever possible by making minutes publiclyavailable shortly after the meeting. The CSA's Guidelineson scientific analysis in policymaking (HM Government 2005) state that there should be apresumption at every stage towards openness andtransparency in the publication of expert advice.Furthermore, the guidelines state that it is good practiceto publish the underpinning evidence for any new policydecision, and that any important omissions in the datashould be clearly documented and identified as such ina way that is meaningful to the non-expert. In relationto pandemic influenza, we believe that the scientificbasis for key decisions, such as the purchase ofoseltamivir and H5N1 vaccines, has not been madepublicly available in full, nor have the reasons for therestriction of complete transparency and openness bycommercial confidentiality. This was confirmed in theevidence we received and we were told that there isinsufficient dialogue between departments andscientists on the use to which scientific advice is put. There should be increased use of scientific information and advice from independent specialist scientists in theformulation of government and public policy relevant topreparedness for combating pandemic influenza.Examples of areas where further scientific input isrequired include the selection and stockpiling ofpandemic vaccines and antiviral drugs and the provisionof appropriate healthcare resources. The committeesshould explicitly seek input and advice from expertsoutside the committee membership and co-optmembers on an ad hoc basis where relevant. 7.2.3 Further sources of advice As discussed above, the ministerial and departmental committees with a remit for avian and pandemicinfluenza receive scientific advice from a number ofindependent and governmental sources. However as weoutline below, the expert scientific advice available togovernment could be further improved by incorporatingscientists from broader disciplines, such as thecommercial sector and the social science community. Neither the Department of Health nor Defra has formal mechanisms for incorporating advice from thecommercial sector, for example manufacturers of(human and avian) vaccines and antivirals. From theevidence we received we understand that, althoughinformal meetings occur on an ad hoc basis, thegreatest source of commercial information appears tobe made available to the departments throughdiscussion of tenders to supply vaccines or antivirals.Despite possible issues of confidentiality, embeddingexperts from the commercial sector into thedepartments' science advisory committees wouldprovide valuable information that is not currently readilyavailable to them. Social science is also underrepresented in the advisory structures to the lead departments. It can inform policynot only on issues such as contingency planning shouldThe Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 29pandemics occur but also when considering the root causes of pandemics. There are roles for social scienceprofessionals such as medical anthropologists andbehavioural scientists in, for example, understanding therole that human behaviour plays in disease spread or incommunicating with and mediating between biomedicalprofessionals and local communities (see section 6.3.3).In ensuring that policymakers receive the best supportand advice on this issue, it is important to recognise andvalue contributions from the full range of social sciencedisciplines in order to achieve a well-rounded view ofthe array of socioeconomic factors involved. This can beachieved by embedding appropriate social scienceprofessionals within interdisciplinary teams from theoutset so that, through cross-fertilisation of ideas withnatural scientists, questions are framed and responsestrategies developed based on as full an understandingof the problems as possible. There are many scientific advisory committees throughout government that provide a range of useful scientific advice to their departments. However, the current system lacks a mechanism to bring together advice from across governmentdepartments to provide a clear channel of scientificadvice to MISC32. In order to incorporate scientists from a broad range of disciplines, and the scientificadvice being generated by the range of scienceadvisory committees across government, into afocal point we recommend that the Department of Health's Pandemic Influenza SAG becomes asingle cross-government Scientific AdvisoryCommittee on pandemic influenza jointly chairedby the CMO and the CSA. In addition to relevantcross-governmental representation, thecommittee's membership should be drawn directlyfrom the scientific, veterinary, social science andmedical communities as well as from thecommercial sector (R35). We also recommend that the Department of Health, Defra and the CCS continue to ensure thatthey are collecting and using evidence from a widerange of independent sources, both from withinand external to government. We urge alldepartments involved in pandemic preparedness tobe open and transparent in their decision makingby publishing minutes of meetings and theevidence on which decisions are made as soon aspossible, in keeping with the CSA's Guidelines on scientific analysis in policymaking (R36). 7.3 Cross-government coordination and communication Together with the Research Councils, government agencies and arms-length bodies are a key source of awide range of independent expertise outsidegovernment departments. These include the HPA, VLA,NIBSC and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Communication within departmentsand their agencies appears to be generally good egbetween the Department of Health and the HPA, orDefra and the VLA. Communication occurs regularlythrough a variety of formal and informal means andrepresentatives of many of these agencies sit ongovernmental advisory committees. However,boundaries of responsibility are not always clearlydefined and we have observed some tension betweenthe scientific advisory role of HPA and VLA and theiroperational roles. Furthermore, we heard evidence thattwo-way communications between the departments and their agencies could be improved if the governmentdepartment informed the agencies how their advice was utilised. Communication between veterinary and medical scientists within the Department of Health and Defra isimproving and we heard evidence of a number of jointprojects being initiated between the two departments.Cross-representation between the departments alsoexists on several advisory committees such as theAdvisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens, Defra'sAnimal Health Group and the UK Zoonoses Group. It is evident that certain areas of scientific knowledge, essential for the development of effective policy inrelation to pandemic influenza, are underdeveloped. The role of the Research Councils in providingcommunication frameworks and resources that allowthe research community to produce this knowledge in a timely fashion needs to be strengthened. This is as true for the ESRC as for the BBSRC or the MRC. Therecent commitment by the Department of Health toestablish a 'cross funders forum' to coordinate researchand development funded by a variety of governmentand other bodies is a step in the right direction. 7.4 International policy development and communication The scientific response to pandemic influenza needs to be coordinated internationally and many countrieshave plans in varying states of detail and completeness.Both WHO and OIE have held a large number ofconsultations with panels of invited experts, as well as having a number of standing committees. In addition, the reference laboratories and WHOCollaborating Centres provide substantial expertise toboth organisations. However, formal and transparentprocesses for determining who is asked for adviceinternationally are lacking. This means that there is a degree of arbitrariness as to who gets consulted on what issue. The role of the international scientificcommunity in offering advice also seems unclear. We recommend that WHO and OIE review theirprocesses for obtaining scientific advice onpandemic influenza and introduce a clearlyThe Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 30 | November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policydefined, open and transparent mechanism. Nations around the world need to continue to supportWHO, and to allow data and results to be madeimmediately available internationally (R37). In terms of contingency planning, the UK can do a certain amount of planning nationally but this is notgoing to be effective without international cooperation.Areas such as scientific and clinical research, surveillanceand the production capacity of vaccines and antivirals would benefit from international cooperation. International coordination of any restrictions on themovement of poultry, of social distancing measures in a pandemic (such as school closures), and to keep the global economy going will also be important. More needs to be done in these areas and must betackled at a European and global level. The evidence tothis study heard that there is no cross-sector mechanismwithin the EU to bring the planning of differentcountries together.The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 318 Table of recommendations Section 2 Avian influenza R1 Innovative methods for improving surveillance of avian influenza and other zoonotic diseases in areas lacking animal disease surveillance infrastructure should be developed. We recommend that the WorldOrganisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) consider developing sentinel networks of farmers or villages in these regions for outbreak reporting. R2 Studies to increase knowledge of the role of wild birds in the spread of infection should be expanded both nationally and internationally and involve collection of data and collaboration of major internationalagencies specifically for this purpose. In the UK these bodies would include the Department forEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), ornithological charities and the Health Protection Agency (HPA). R3 Surveillance and collection of samples from wildfowl is labour intensive and we recommend that participants in the surveillance networks should receive adequate funding from Defra and the European Commission to continue to operate efficiently in the UK, Europe and globally. R4 Research should be done by Defra and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) to ensure that procedures for avian influenza virus collection are robust, that the subsequent transport ofsamples is secure, and that methods used for virus isolation and characterisation are the most appropriate and up to date. R5 Defra should set up a vaccination committee, similar to Department of Health's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. This committee should advise the department on the development of its vaccination strategies across all animal diseases, including avian influenza. R6 As part of their current calls for proposals, research funders, in collaboration with Defra and the vaccine industry, should solicit proposals from the research community to address new approaches to avian influenza vaccines. R7 Defra, in collaboration with the BBSRC and the Medical Research Council (MRC), should examine areas where further research could be funded such as basic avian influenza research and avian immunology. R8 Government should provide increased funding to expand high containment research facilities to enable vital research in the field of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Section 3 Epidemiology and surveillance R9 European Union (EU) member states, including the UK, should work closely with WHO to support scientific research relevant to the quality and value of influenza surveillance and research to improve the understanding of the epidemiology of influenza. R10 The Department of Health and Defra, in collaboration with WHO and the scientific and medical communities, should review the potential applications of the data collected in infectious disease surveillance generally. R11 Genetic, antigenic and pathogenic data relating to new avian viruses, especially H5, H7 and H9 subtypes, should be made widely and rapidly available. In particular, samples of virus isolates should be made available as a matter of urgency to bona fide laboratories for research and development purposes.The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 32 | November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policyR12 The UK government should support the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data and ensures that government and publicly funded laboratories put in place plans to publish all surveillance data. R13 The UK government should lead efforts to coordinate plans for real-time data collection and data sharing during a pandemic, at the EU, EU and G8, and WHO/UN level. Achieving consistency of the detailed datacollected on the first few hundred cases in each country and the summary data collected thereafter couldoffer significant benefits to collaborating countries prepared to share data in real time, since the data collected in a country affected early could aid final preparedness planning in countries not yet affected. R14 Additional epidemiological studies are needed to analyse existing disease and social data to estimate the likely impact of social distancing measures (especially school closure) on a future pandemic and to examine the evidence for population behavioural changes in a pandemic that might affect disease transmission. Section 4 Antivirals R15 The Department of Health should continue to review the size of the current stockpile of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and as a matter of urgency revisits the decision not to stockpile zanamivir (Relenza) at the same level for use especially where resistance to oseltamivir is suspected. R16 WHO will have a central role to ensure that the data are available from the first reported outbreaks and resulting information is effectively disseminated to decision makers to guide interventions. The Departmentof Health should use its influence internationally to ensure this research is supported and can be done wherever the initial outbreaks occur. R17 Intensification of the surveillance of the sensitivity of current human and avian influenza viruses (H5N1 in particular) to antiviral drugs (the M2 and neuraminidase inhibitors) should be coordinated by WHO andundertaken on a global basis. In particular, the system should ensure that surveillance has the sensitivity to measure the degree to which resistant virus is being transmitted in the community. R18 The evidence base for antiviral treatment of individuals in risk groups (eg those with an immune deficiency condition) needs to be reviewed by the Department of Health and if necessary expanded, with particular emphasis being placed on protocols to minimise emergence of resistance in such populations. R19 Research in both industry and academia aimed at the development and evaluation of novel antivirals for influenza should be encouraged and supported. Extensive links already exist between academic research and the pharmaceutical industries and public-private partnerships could be developed in this area. Section 5 Human vaccination R20 Many very young children are immunologically naive to influenza and further research is needed on the characteristics of primary immune responses and the safety and efficacy of the use of seasonal andpandemic influenza vaccines in children. We recommend that this research is supported by the Department of Health as a matter of urgency. R21 The Depa rtment of Health should make samples of the recently purchased H5N1 vaccines available to the research community, as soon as is practicably possible, and the MRC should solicit high-quality research application specifically to analyse these pandemic influenza vaccines. R22 The Department of Health should make arrangements with industry that allow it to be open and transparent in its decision making and procurement processes, to use independent experts to advise asappropriate, and make the evidence on which decisions are made available to the scientific community.The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 33R23 The Department of Health should continue to expand its seasonal influenza vaccine programme and relax rules about individuals outside the 'at risk' groups purchasing seasonal influenza vaccines directly from NHS General Practitioners, to encourage industry to increase production capacity. R24 The Department of Health and the vaccine industry should continue to evaluate the use of whole virus vaccines and monitor the results of ongoing trials of whole virus vaccines against H5N1. R25 As a matter of urgency the Department of Health should take the lead in assembling a work programme with industry and academia for the development of new adjuvants for vaccines. This should be done inparallel with clinical trials to compare directly the effectiveness of current adjuvants with existing H5N1 pandemic vaccines, with whole virus vaccines and with information sharing from ongoing trials. R26 WHO should coordinate a global project for sharing information and data on ongoing influenza vaccine research and development, in both the commercial and academic sectors. Section 6 Public health R27 The Department of Health should commission external experts to scrutinise the revised pandemic influenza plan and where appropriate should form expert groups to review critical aspects of the plan. R28 The HPA, and Department of Health should identify research that should be conducted to identify those non-pharmaceutical interventions likely to have the greatest impact and, where appropriate, commission trials to assess the effectiveness of these interventions. R29 Bodies such as the European Commission should consider ways to stimulate an environment which would encourage investment in new diagnostic products for influenza. R30 The government, together with the Economics and Social Research Council, should consider procedures to collect data on behavioural and attitudinal patterns, both currently and throughout a pandemic. These data would also allow subsequent analyses of impact of the outbreak and, more importantly, provide thebasis for predictive models of behaviour that could be used in refining and improving planning for future pandemics of influenza and other infectious diseases. R31 To ensure the communications strategy for pandemic influenza is fit for purpose we recommend that the government's planned communications strategy should be subject to independent review and testing within six months of the publication of the revised Pandemic Plan. R32 Consultations should be undertaken now with stakeholders about the most appropriate data to be collected and the most effective methods to collect these data in order to evaluate the impact of apandemic. Having a database that will serve the purposes of modelling and prediction as well as evaluation should be attempted. Section 7 Science policy R33 A leading non-governmental scientist in the area of influenza should be appointed as lead questioner and adviser to MISC32 for specific issues, complementing the roles of the Government's Chief Scientific Adviser(CSA) and the Chief Medical Officer (CMO). This scientist should be appointed jointly by the CSA and CMOin discussion with relevant learned societies. This model should be adopted in all future Ministerial committees for other animal and human health emergencies. R34 The role and remit of science advisory committees in relation to pandemic influenza should be made explicit and the organisational decision making routes should be clarified to show how scientific advice is utilised.The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences 34 | November 2006 | Pandemic influenza: science to policyR35 In order to incorporate scientists from a broad range of disciplines, and the scientific advice being generated by the range of science advisory committees across government, into a focal point werecommend that the Department of Health's Pandemic Influenza Scientific Advisory Group becomes a single cross-government Scientific Advisory Committee on pandemic influenza jointly chaired by the CMOand the CSA. In addition to relevant cross-governmental representation, the committee's membershipshould be drawn directly from the scientific, veterinary, social science and medical communities as well as from the commercial sector. R36 The Department of Health, Defra and the Civil Contingencies Secretariat should continue to ensure that they are collecting and using evidence from a wide range of independent sources, both from within andexternal to government. We urge all departments involved in pandemic preparedness to be open andtransparent in their decision making by publishing minutes of meetings and the evidence on which thedecisions are made as soon as possible, in keeping with the CSA's Guidelines on scientific analysis in policy making . R37 WHO and OIE should review their processes for obtaining scientific advice on pandemic influenza and introduce a clearly defined, open and transparent mechanism. Nations around the world need to continueto support WHO, and to allow data and results to be made immediately available internationally.The Royal Society & The Academy of Medical Sciences Pandemic influenza: science to policy | November 2006 | 359 References Bognor et al (2006).
